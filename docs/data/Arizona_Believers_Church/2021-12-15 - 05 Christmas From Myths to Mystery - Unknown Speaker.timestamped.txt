[0:00] exodus chapter 12
[0:02] verses 1 to 6
[0:04] exodus chapter 12 verses 1 to 6 is where
[0:07] i'd like to read
[0:08] this evening
[0:10] there are so many things transpiring and
[0:13] taking place
[0:14] so many different needs in the body of
[0:16] christ i apologize if i seem a little
[0:18] bit
[0:19] scattered this evening and hope i didn't
[0:20] miss anything
[0:22] but exodus chapter 12 verse 1 and we're
[0:25] continuing on the series on christmas
[0:27] this may seem to be a little bit of a
[0:28] strange
[0:30] uh
[0:31] strange scripture to use but why it has
[0:34] so much relevance to christmas
[0:36] and this in your bible it might mention
[0:38] it and the heading mind says the
[0:39] passover instituted by god
[0:42] and that's in and then in chapter 13
[0:44] they're actually remembering the
[0:45] passover and following it but this is
[0:47] where it's the commandment is given and
[0:49] the lord spake unto moses and aaron in
[0:51] the land of egypt saying this month
[0:53] shall be unto you the beginning of month
[0:56] so their calendar resets this is their
[0:58] first of the year it shall be the first
[1:00] month of the year to you
[1:02] speaking unto all the congregation of
[1:04] israel saying in the tenth day of this
[1:06] month they shall take no
[1:08] take to them every man a lamb according
[1:10] to the house of their fathers a lamb
[1:11] foreign house and if the household be
[1:13] too little for the lamb let him and his
[1:15] neighbor next unto his house take it
[1:18] according to the number of the souls
[1:20] every man according to his eating shall
[1:22] make your count for the lamb
[1:24] your lamb shall be without blemish a
[1:27] male of the first year ye shall take it
[1:30] out from the sheep or from the goats and
[1:32] you shall keep it up until the
[1:34] fourteenth day of the same month and the
[1:36] whole assembly of the congregation of
[1:38] israel shall kill it in
[1:40] the evening
[1:41] amen god bless you you can have your
[1:43] seats
[1:46] as we're continuing on the subject of
[1:48] christmas and in particular we spent
[1:51] three services looking at myths related
[1:53] to christmas
[1:54] and covered a lot of ground and we've
[1:56] appreciated the feedback that we've got
[1:57] from you
[1:58] um even in ways of it being challenging
[2:01] or just how in particular ways god has
[2:03] been speaking to you how relevant it's
[2:05] been i've even appreciated the the
[2:07] feedback that has come maybe from a
[2:09] place of concern and wondering
[2:11] um whether or not someone is doing it
[2:12] right and i have heard from some that
[2:14] have kind of wanted to know my position
[2:17] on certain things
[2:18] and uh as we mentioned before as a
[2:20] church we don't take any particular
[2:22] position on some of the things that
[2:23] we've spoken about
[2:25] because we believe it ought to be up to
[2:26] you as pastors of your own home your
[2:28] husbands
[2:30] as wives and assistant to the pastor
[2:32] there in your home
[2:33] to kind of lead and to guide and make
[2:35] the right kind of decisions for your
[2:36] family because you would know best where
[2:38] we see things in the word of god very
[2:40] plainly we take those positions we
[2:42] preach those things as a church but
[2:43] there's some things that we rather leave
[2:45] to
[2:46] the individual leadership of the holy
[2:48] spirit in people's lives and so you
[2:50] looked at a lot of different myths
[2:52] and i don't want to
[2:54] go back over them tonight so you can
[2:56] breathe your sigh of relief
[2:58] now but i want to just kind of jump in
[3:00] the one that we were kind of looking at
[3:03] at the end of sunday
[3:05] and it was related to the date that is
[3:07] commonly celebrated of christmas
[3:09] december 25th
[3:11] and one of the things that we're kind of
[3:12] pointing out i'll put in these terms
[3:14] maybe now one of the great mysteries
[3:15] about christmas is when was the exact
[3:18] date that jesus was born
[3:20] and i will say having turned myself into
[3:23] a mini historian over the last couple
[3:25] months history has done
[3:26] a tremendous job of complicating or at
[3:29] least obscuring the truth of christ's
[3:31] birth there's a lot of things that just
[3:33] seem to obscure and confuse even finding
[3:36] where there's um some academic
[3:38] dishonesty and there's actually some
[3:40] very i think overt ways that people have
[3:42] tried to obscure and convolute the truth
[3:44] of when christ was born
[3:46] by putting out their false narratives
[3:48] and false sources and different things
[3:50] and one of the things that we saw is
[3:51] that there's many justifications for
[3:54] december 25th being the date of christ's
[3:56] birth and even many different
[3:57] calculations for arriving at that time
[4:00] period that aren't necessarily pagan
[4:02] it's not that they said well this is
[4:04] when jupiter was born or this is not
[4:06] everyone is pointing to that time period
[4:08] to calculate when christ was born but
[4:10] there's a lot of religious and
[4:12] theological debates surrounding it to
[4:14] affix december 25th as the date of
[4:16] christ's birth
[4:17] but even then even though there might
[4:19] not be on everyone's
[4:21] hands this fault of
[4:23] trying to align things with paganism
[4:25] there has been an intentional blending
[4:28] of secular feasts secular traditions
[4:30] pagan traditions pagan worship with this
[4:32] date and this time very intentional so
[4:35] things are kind of lined up together
[4:37] with some of these things that we
[4:38] recognize as pagan and has a symmetry
[4:40] with babylon and it's important to
[4:42] recognize those things
[4:44] and as i've studied and i'm sure you're
[4:45] aware of and you've experienced yourself
[4:47] there's debates on every single aspect
[4:49] of the birth of christ whether it be the
[4:50] month the week the day
[4:52] the time of day and even debates as to
[4:55] whether or not what the word in means
[4:57] does it mean a part of a house and they
[4:59] debate the sizes of houses in bethlehem
[5:02] during that time period they debate
[5:04] whether or not it was in a stable
[5:06] there's great theological debates about
[5:07] the fact that it was actually in a cave
[5:09] not a stable it was in the side of a
[5:11] cliff it was here it was there and
[5:12] there's debates that rage over every
[5:15] single one of these aspects even down to
[5:16] whether or not it was actually a manger
[5:19] uh there's debates as to what was real
[5:21] what it represented and what it actually
[5:23] was so there's
[5:25] we could spend all of 2022 preaching
[5:27] about christmas myths
[5:29] and not even scratch the surface because
[5:31] everyone has spent time
[5:33] trying to figure out what all these
[5:34] elements are
[5:36] and i believe there's a truth to each
[5:37] one of these elements and i believe that
[5:39] there are representations and types and
[5:42] symbolisms contained in each one
[5:44] otherwise i don't i think that god would
[5:46] have left them unrecorded if there
[5:48] wasn't some some meaning in these things
[5:50] and we found that as we've studied the
[5:52] bible whether it be in the book of ruth
[5:53] or in the story of abraham that god
[5:56] shared details with us because it could
[5:57] convey certain truths to us
[6:00] and i i as i've looked this i looked at
[6:03] this i felt that god has allowed the
[6:05] date of jesus christ the date of his
[6:07] birth to be shrouded in mystery for a
[6:08] reason
[6:10] that it's not just perfectly conclusive
[6:12] yep it was december 25th it was nine
[6:14] o'clock in the evening and it was at
[6:16] such and such location there's certain
[6:17] things that just seem to be kind of lost
[6:19] or even as some writers have said is
[6:21] that the writer of the bible being god
[6:23] himself as he inspired the writers
[6:25] didn't give us specifics so and that the
[6:28] early church didn't even concern
[6:29] themselves with it but yet god has
[6:31] allowed it to be mysterious and not
[6:33] conclusive and i found one of the
[6:35] ancient writers or maybe one of the mid
[6:37] mid century writers maybe in the
[6:40] the mental ages wrote this there's a
[6:42] catalog of no less than
[6:45] 136 different opinions concerning the
[6:48] year of christ's birth and as to his
[6:50] birth day that has been placed by
[6:53] christian sex and learned men in every
[6:55] month of the year
[6:57] so if you want to study it you'll find
[6:58] that you just pick your birth month
[7:00] whatever it is you'll find some religion
[7:02] some christianity sect that believes
[7:05] christ was born in this particular month
[7:07] 136 different opinions as to the year
[7:10] and then a as to his birthday there's a
[7:12] there's some idea somewhere that'll
[7:14] represent in any particular month of the
[7:16] 12 months of the year
[7:18] but brother branham mentioned two
[7:20] different quotes we want to read that we
[7:21] read at the end on sunday he says i do
[7:23] not believe jesus would care what day
[7:25] you worshipped his birthday on if it's
[7:27] the 25th 26th or whatever if it's it's
[7:30] may april may june july or whenever it
[7:33] might be just so you worship him on any
[7:35] day
[7:36] i take that to uh to mean that he
[7:39] wouldn't want you just to fix a
[7:40] particular day to worship him just so
[7:43] that you would worship him on that day
[7:45] but rather if you don't
[7:47] uh
[7:48] venerate before just one particular day
[7:50] maybe you consecrate yourself every day
[7:52] instead of just finding one day
[7:54] that you recognize the birth of christ
[7:56] maybe you go
[7:57] you go every day you do that and what's
[7:59] happened by being able to fix a date of
[8:02] when christ was born and then also fix a
[8:04] date to when christ was crucified or
[8:07] resurrected
[8:08] and and these dates begin to have this
[8:10] preeminence within christianity what has
[8:13] become the traditional days that people
[8:15] attend church when they don't the rest
[8:16] of the year christmas and easter and so
[8:19] truly we can say that jesus wouldn't
[8:21] care that you worshipped him on any
[8:23] particular date just so that you had a
[8:24] day to worship him but my words now
[8:26] would be that he would want you to
[8:28] worship him every day
[8:30] and then god's gifts always find their
[8:31] places as brother branham was talking
[8:33] about how paganism was blended in with
[8:35] christianity he says and they made it
[8:37] the son of god his birthday the date of
[8:40] the sun god's birthday and he says but
[8:41] what difference does it make even if
[8:43] they was doing it in july or august or
[8:45] whenever it might be
[8:47] it's still the sacredness of remembering
[8:49] that god gave us the hope that we have
[8:51] in us
[8:52] so we do not believe that jesus would
[8:54] care what day you worshipped on just so
[8:56] you'd have a day to worship him and he
[8:58] says but what difference does it make
[8:59] what difference does it make whether
[9:01] it's in july or august or any particular
[9:03] day he says it's still something sacred
[9:05] and he made the statement it's not a
[9:07] pagan celebration to us
[9:09] and i think there was a lot of the
[9:11] quotes that i shared on sunday
[9:14] conveyed brother branham's identifying
[9:16] the pagan origins and even some of the
[9:18] pagan stains that are attached to the
[9:20] christmas celebration and and maybe some
[9:23] of the feedback i got is that was real
[9:24] that was real heavy you know it was real
[9:26] uh real hard and um i rested in the fact
[9:29] that i was it was it wasn't me i was
[9:31] quoting it
[9:32] and i think it's important that we know
[9:33] what's said even if it even if it rubs
[9:36] against maybe our opinions the way we've
[9:37] got everything figured out in the
[9:39] message sometimes it's worth it to go
[9:40] back and revisit what was actually said
[9:43] uh to be balanced by those things and
[9:45] let them inform us i think it's
[9:47] important that we as a church be
[9:48] listening to the voice of god and
[9:50] listening to the sermons that we have
[9:52] available to us
[9:54] now if we could look again at luke
[9:55] chapter 2 verses 7 and 8 this scripture
[9:59] we used last time and i think it's a
[10:01] um
[10:05] it describes this scene
[10:07] as
[10:10] there is a
[10:12] description of what's taking place here
[10:15] at the time of the birth of christ and
[10:16] the specific moments when he's born and
[10:18] it says in luke chapter 2 verses 7 and 8
[10:21] as we have already read that he she was
[10:23] there was no
[10:24] uh we're going to see here there's no
[10:26] room for him at the end so it kind of
[10:27] gives this setting and she brought forth
[10:29] her first born son kind of a very neat
[10:31] and very clean description of a baby
[10:33] being born she brought forth her first
[10:35] born son and wrapped him in swaddling
[10:38] clothes even that holds some symbolism
[10:40] and laid him in a manger that holds some
[10:43] symbolism because there was no room for
[10:45] them in the inn
[10:47] and that is uh that is the description
[10:50] of the birth of jesus christ and then
[10:51] immediately it brings us to this scene
[10:53] and there were in the same country
[10:55] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[10:58] watch over their flock by night
[11:01] and by positioning this description
[11:03] right after the birth of christ i
[11:05] believe that the scriptures are wanting
[11:06] to convey to us that christ was born in
[11:09] this time that it would have been in
[11:10] this evening time or this passing of the
[11:12] setting of the sun and it says they're
[11:14] keeping watch over their flock by nights
[11:16] would have been a particular watch um
[11:18] that these shepherds would have been uh
[11:20] in the field with the sheep
[11:22] as it's very this language is used and i
[11:25] believe that that this verse alone verse
[11:27] 8 being used right at the moment in the
[11:29] time that christ is born holds details
[11:31] that are relevant
[11:32] about the birth of christ
[11:34] and and to his purpose and there's
[11:36] things that we can gather from this
[11:38] and and i know if it seems like i've
[11:40] been hiding the ball and i haven't
[11:42] emphasized this enough tonight i'm
[11:43] really going to emphasize it for people
[11:45] who've been waiting maybe for some of
[11:46] these things but we do not believe that
[11:48] jesus christ was born on december 25th i
[11:51] do not believe that i do not believe
[11:53] that we are taught that we are not
[11:55] taught that jesus christ was born on
[11:57] december 25th we do not see and we are
[11:59] not taught that he was born in the fall
[12:01] or in the winter times we're not just
[12:02] kind of moving it by a few weeks
[12:04] we do not believe that he was born
[12:06] during this that time or even this time
[12:09] and if it's worth mentioning that we do
[12:12] not believe that determining the
[12:13] specific day or even the specific year
[12:15] of his birth is necessary for salvation
[12:19] that we we have to know the date he was
[12:20] born at the time he was born or that if
[12:22] someone was i really think it was in
[12:24] december that that's going to be some
[12:25] sort of leaven that's going to stare and
[12:27] keep them from receiving the holy ghost
[12:29] and we do not believe
[12:30] that affixing a date and a time and
[12:32] accepting that and agreeing to it is
[12:34] necessary for proper worship
[12:37] if there was be a a segment of believers
[12:39] that held that it was may 12th that
[12:41] christ was born and another one
[12:42] september 11th and they really head to
[12:44] it and they they celebrated christmas
[12:46] during that time then um that's it's not
[12:48] necessary to have those dates and those
[12:50] times and those traditions to worship
[12:52] god
[12:53] that we could you could have those
[12:54] beliefs but don't let those beliefs keep
[12:56] you from worshiping because those things
[12:58] aren't necessary to worship him in
[13:00] spirit and in truth
[13:03] i i came across this statement in a very
[13:05] old commentary it is sufficient for us
[13:07] to know that he was born
[13:09] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[13:12] assumed our nature and in consequence
[13:14] thereof is become an all-sufficient
[13:17] savior and redeemer and whomsoever
[13:19] believeth with the right faith shall not
[13:21] perish but have eternal life that is
[13:23] what is sufficient not that we believe
[13:24] he was born on this day or that day but
[13:26] that we believe that he was born was
[13:28] made flesh and dwelt among us and that
[13:31] he
[13:31] and these things these are the things
[13:33] that we believe
[13:34] now having said that in saying that we
[13:36] do not believe he was born in christmas
[13:37] the scriptures point out born to born at
[13:40] december 25th during this time
[13:43] scriptures point out these particular
[13:44] scriptures point out certain details
[13:46] that specify a particular season
[13:49] by reading this it's kind of i want to
[13:51] say uses the word clues but it's kind of
[13:53] zeroing in on a time period and though
[13:55] it may be a broad time period even the
[13:58] broad time period would rule out this
[14:00] fall time or this winter time that many
[14:02] people believe christ was born
[14:04] and it's the it's kind of this phrase
[14:06] i'll summarize summarize it this way at
[14:07] the time that christ is born there are
[14:09] shepherds in the field keeping flock
[14:12] but their flock at night and so this
[14:14] would point us to a specific time of
[14:16] year and by its wording and by its
[14:18] imagery it's likely not the winter
[14:21] now there's been those that have
[14:23] witnessed and even i think there's uh
[14:25] maybe some well-known writings within
[14:26] certain circles of how people have been
[14:29] in judea during this time of year and
[14:31] observed uh shepherds in the field with
[14:33] their sheep and so there's always a
[14:35] there's always like maybe a counter
[14:36] narrative there's always some some
[14:38] outlier something that's different but
[14:40] really this idea that this is this time
[14:43] of year that the shepherds would be
[14:45] keeping their flock at night would not
[14:46] be the winter is not really a a
[14:50] a mystery to a lot of people who read
[14:52] their bibles and study the bible i'm
[14:54] going to read from i think six different
[14:56] commentaries many of them very old from
[14:59] hundreds of years even to more modern
[15:00] commentaries and this is the conclusion
[15:03] that they made by reading these
[15:04] scriptures here's one it says on this
[15:06] very ground luke 7 chapter 2 verse 8 on
[15:09] this very ground the nativity in
[15:11] december should be given up
[15:13] the feeding of the flocks by night in
[15:14] the fields is a chronological fact which
[15:16] casts considerable light upon this
[15:18] disputed point
[15:19] so i'm saying the very fact that this
[15:21] verse
[15:22] should cause us to abandon the idea that
[15:24] christ was born in december another
[15:26] another commentary it is not likely that
[15:28] he was born as is commonly received at
[15:30] the latter end of december in the depth
[15:32] of winter
[15:34] another one for this it seems plain that
[15:36] the period of the year usually assigned
[15:37] to our lord's birth is too late just
[15:40] based upon this verse alone they're
[15:41] saying these ver this verse alone kind
[15:43] of clues us in that you know what
[15:44] probably wasn't born on december 25th it
[15:47] said shepherds and their flocks would
[15:48] not be found abiding this is another one
[15:50] abiding in the open fields at night in
[15:52] december for the paramount reason that
[15:54] there would be no pastorage at that time
[15:58] and then another one as it is not
[15:59] probable that they expose their flocks
[16:01] to the coldness of winter nights and
[16:03] that climate may be strongly argued from
[16:05] this circumstance that those who have
[16:08] fixed upon december for the birth of
[16:09] christ have been mistaken in the time of
[16:12] it
[16:13] and so there's a lot of a lot of others
[16:15] that would agree to this point and see
[16:16] this and boy i'm telling you there's a
[16:18] there's stacks of research that people
[16:21] put into this and analyzing weather
[16:23] patterns and a lot of different things
[16:24] that are used to identify this so
[16:26] there's a lot of people that have
[16:27] realized that the bible is kind of
[16:29] telling us it probably wasn't december
[16:32] and what time what time we believe it
[16:34] would be and with this is as believers
[16:35] we have this uh we know in our hearts
[16:37] we'll get to some of these statements
[16:38] here in a moment of the specific time it
[16:40] would be
[16:41] but as it says they were these shepherds
[16:43] were in abiding in the field keeping
[16:45] watch on their flock by night it's
[16:47] pointing to the spring season in
[16:49] particular the lambing season when lambs
[16:51] are born
[16:53] and and i went just found uh visited
[16:55] some farms that uh
[16:57] that have sheep farms and they breed
[16:59] sheep and i found that the best time um
[17:02] for them to to breed is in the fall
[17:05] and the best time for them to be born
[17:07] based upon their gestation period for
[17:08] when they when they breed is in the
[17:10] spring and there's over and over again i
[17:12] found secular websites not pagan one
[17:14] secular websites that talked about how
[17:16] the best time for lambs to be born is in
[17:18] the is in this season because it's where
[17:20] there's mild weather and there's an
[17:22] abundance of very really good uh grass
[17:25] and green grass for the for these lambs
[17:27] to feed upon and so it's very important
[17:29] this would be an important time for
[17:31] lambs to be born and i believe that's
[17:33] kind of what the lord is signaling it
[17:35] says she brought forth their firstborn
[17:37] and at the same time in the same country
[17:39] there's shepherds abiding in the field
[17:41] keeping watch over their flock by night
[17:43] and brother branham in this sermon why
[17:45] it had to be shepherd and some of you
[17:47] probably have noticed how it's not
[17:48] shepherds but it's singular why it had
[17:50] to be shepherd it's very interesting
[17:52] wouldn't it be nice to know why he said
[17:54] shepherd
[17:57] amen okay yeah i don't know
[17:59] it's interesting isn't it
[18:01] we just would speculate we are
[18:02] approaching christmas the streets are
[18:05] crowded with men and women boys and
[18:06] girls pushing shoving trying to buy a
[18:08] present to return to somebody who would
[18:10] give them likewise
[18:12] right i bought you this hoping that
[18:14] maybe you'd give me something similar in
[18:16] return or at least spend just as much as
[18:18] i did i kept the price tag on it so you
[18:20] wouldn't cheap out this year and buy me
[18:22] a five dollar gift when i'm just giving
[18:23] you a hundred and five dollar gift it's
[18:25] kind of identifying really what takes
[18:26] place anymore many people call
[18:28] themselves christians are on the streets
[18:29] buying cigarettes remember happy to
[18:32] holidays happy smoking
[18:33] he says on the streets buying cigarettes
[18:35] liquor for christmas presents and he's
[18:37] praying this prayer he says god it looks
[18:39] like they're throwing it right back in
[18:40] your face teaching their children of
[18:43] some fiction roman pagan theology of a
[18:45] saint nicholas some myth that's easy
[18:47] accepted by the world
[18:49] now just think about that it's taught
[18:51] that way because it's easier to accept
[18:53] he says and they turn down the real
[18:56] christ of christmas
[18:57] the real lamb
[19:00] the real christ of christmas he
[19:01] identifies that what they're turning
[19:03] down and all the frivolity and
[19:04] everything that it's become what they're
[19:06] turning down is the christ of christmas
[19:08] and the christ of christmas is
[19:10] personified here in the language he's
[19:11] using as the real lamb
[19:13] now pondered this and i realized tonight
[19:16] that it's a it's a real safe area for
[19:18] amen because i'm not preaching anything
[19:19] that's deep and mysterious to us but
[19:21] part of the mystery the messiah's first
[19:23] coming
[19:24] was that he would be a sacrificial lamb
[19:27] and again we emphasize this quite a bit
[19:29] that was unexpected to everyone they
[19:31] were not looking in mangers to see the
[19:33] messiah they were they were not looking
[19:36] in these they were not looking even in
[19:37] cribs for the messiah they were
[19:39] expecting that the messiah would make
[19:41] himself known in some regal way some
[19:43] powerful way and
[19:45] some stature that would declare this is
[19:46] a man of royalty this is a man of power
[19:48] this is a man with political influence
[19:50] as we identified quite often that the
[19:52] jews thought that this would be a king
[19:54] that would gather all nations together
[19:56] such a powerful ruler and a powerful
[19:58] leader that under his leadership and
[20:00] rulership all the gentiles and the whole
[20:02] world would be dwelled together in peace
[20:04] and that they would come to his light
[20:06] and they would all gather to israel
[20:07] saying you are the example of
[20:09] civilization and and the way a country
[20:12] should be run and so here he comes
[20:15] and he comes in this stable he's born
[20:18] wrapped in swaddling clothes laid in a
[20:20] manger in the maybe in a cave not in a
[20:23] home and not anywhere you would expect
[20:25] maybe a king to be born but yet he's in
[20:28] these circumstances the lamb comes forth
[20:31] and this is part of the mystery of his
[20:33] first coming is he's a sacrificial lamb
[20:36] so think about it it's his birth that
[20:38] hides him
[20:41] that had he had a different birth maybe
[20:43] people would start thinking and
[20:44] wondering and if he was born into
[20:46] particular family under different
[20:47] circumstances maybe others would wonder
[20:50] but it's his birth that hides them
[20:53] and it's not until it's not until the
[20:56] the wise men
[20:57] give some sort of indication that herod
[20:59] that hey there's the king of the jews
[21:01] that the king has been born
[21:03] that motivates him to kill um of the
[21:06] children two and under in this
[21:07] particular region uh to to settle it to
[21:10] deal with it maybe if he just said went
[21:12] out
[21:13] place by place that night because well
[21:14] he's going to be born this night going
[21:16] on this night
[21:17] they made it may have never considered
[21:18] that location
[21:19] but as we think about it that the
[21:21] circumstances of his birth hide him
[21:23] and i love this thought because god
[21:25] hides himself
[21:27] in simplicity
[21:29] and so many truths of the word of god
[21:30] are hid in simplicity hid behind the
[21:32] circumstances the reproach of it oh well
[21:34] that would be illegitimate and oh what
[21:36] about this and oh what about that and a
[21:38] lot of stigma and things are placed a
[21:40] lot of scarlet letters are placed on
[21:42] things because of its simplicity
[21:44] and lies that are told about it but it's
[21:46] his birth the circumstances of his birth
[21:48] that hide him but those very same
[21:50] circumstances that hide him also reveal
[21:53] him
[21:54] because where he's hid that's where he's
[21:56] found and so he hides himself in
[21:58] simplicity so if god hides himself in
[22:01] simplicity and we're like god we're
[22:02] playing hide and seek with god so we're
[22:04] trying to find god don't go trying to
[22:06] find him somewhere other than simplicity
[22:09] because he hides in simplicity if he
[22:11] hides in simplicity that's where you're
[22:12] going to find him and so he's hid
[22:14] himself in this birth and then he
[22:16] reveals himself in it too something
[22:18] about his character about his purpose
[22:19] about what he's going to do is in is
[22:21] actually in his birth
[22:23] and so the scriptures and i'm just going
[22:25] to use a few tonight at key intervals or
[22:27] pointing to christ coming as a lamb i'm
[22:29] just going to use a few tonight but
[22:31] there's many different things in the
[22:32] word of god that are pointing to this
[22:35] that he would come and remember these
[22:37] scriptures are pointing forward to his
[22:38] coming as a lamb
[22:40] in isaiah chapter 53 verse 7 he was
[22:43] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[22:44] opened not his mouth he is brought as a
[22:47] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[22:50] before her shears is dumb so he openeth
[22:52] not his mouth this is a prophecy of
[22:55] jesus christ this is a prophecy that he
[22:57] would come meek and lowly that he's
[22:59] going to come
[23:01] despised and rejected a man of sorrow
[23:03] acquainted with grief
[23:05] and it's painting the picture of the
[23:06] messiah very differently than what those
[23:08] in judea would expect him to come as in
[23:11] its time and in its season but here he's
[23:14] described as a lamb coming to the
[23:16] slaughter
[23:17] so when christ is born and he's come to
[23:19] the age
[23:20] around his 30th birthday it's time for
[23:22] him to be baptized and he's going to be
[23:24] coming to john to be baptized and john
[23:26] is the forerunner he declares this on
[23:29] john 1 29 the next day john seeth jesus
[23:32] coming unto him and notice this inspired
[23:34] utterance and saith behold the lamb of
[23:37] god which taketh away the sin of the
[23:39] world
[23:41] now to take away sins is just going to
[23:43] bring you right to this idea and what
[23:45] was foreshadowed in the sacrifice is
[23:47] that blood was shed to deal with sins it
[23:50] was a covering upon the altar to atone
[23:52] for sins so he says here's the lamb of
[23:55] god that takes away the sin of the world
[23:57] he's actually using a language that
[23:59] pointed back to all the sacrifices that
[24:01] were pointing forward to the coming of
[24:04] the messiah
[24:05] and john is specifically saying that
[24:07] this messiah who is amongst us now is
[24:10] the lamb of god who takes away the sins
[24:12] of the world
[24:14] and i think it's the next day he's
[24:15] talking to his disciples again and he
[24:16] sees jesus and he says it again in verse
[24:18] 36 behold the lamb of god
[24:21] that that behold the lamb of god he's
[24:22] still declaring it this is the
[24:24] characterization that the forerunner
[24:26] this is the this is the language the
[24:28] descriptive language this is the title
[24:31] this is these are the symbols this is
[24:32] the ministry that he affixes to christ
[24:35] the lamb of god that takes away the sins
[24:37] of the world
[24:38] this is the this is the nature of his
[24:40] coming as the messiah
[24:42] and then peter he picks it up in first
[24:43] peter chapter nine excuse me chapter
[24:45] nine wow that's the different
[24:47] translation get the nine chapters in the
[24:48] book of peter first peter chapter one
[24:51] verse verse 19 you also find it in
[24:53] revelations 5 revelation 22 a few other
[24:55] places in revelation where it's the lamb
[24:57] it's the lamb it's the lamb all right
[24:59] he's identified at this scene in
[25:00] revelations 5 around the throne he's
[25:02] seen it later that he's in that city on
[25:04] the throne of god here's the lamb so
[25:06] this character of christ and the messiah
[25:08] being a lamb
[25:09] is something that's hid in the old
[25:11] testament but since he came as a lamb
[25:13] it's almost as if it pops out in 3d now
[25:15] and we see this and so peter says now in
[25:18] first peter chapter 1 verse 19 but with
[25:20] the precious blood of jesus christ
[25:22] notice this beautiful language as of a
[25:24] lamb without blemish and without spot
[25:27] now this would be very important to a
[25:29] hebrew because they knew that the
[25:30] particular sacrifice when the lamb was
[25:32] offered had to be without blemish had to
[25:34] be perfect had to be without spot even
[25:36] when it came to the offering of a heifer
[25:37] it had to be perfect it had to be
[25:39] without blemish there couldn't be any
[25:40] birth defects and so here he's
[25:42] describing christ as a lamb without
[25:44] blemish and without spot
[25:46] and i could have used four or five
[25:48] different scriptures just immediately
[25:49] tonight of how he knew no sin
[25:52] he was without sin the scripture over
[25:54] and over and over again is reminding us
[25:56] that christ was without sin so he's in
[25:58] the image of a spotless lamb
[26:01] and when he spoke at thunder
[26:03] that he's in the image of the lamb who's
[26:05] without sin
[26:06] just give it a moment it just it gets
[26:07] unsettled about this time every
[26:09] wednesday night
[26:13] maybe we cycled through it
[26:15] there's we think it's maybe just radio
[26:16] interference but uh maybe it's devil
[26:19] interference the pagans are up to
[26:20] something again
[26:21] but you'll find different places where
[26:23] he's referred to as being spotless and
[26:25] sinless why to put him in this image of
[26:27] what he fulfilled the foreshadowing the
[26:29] type of a sacrifice and a lamb who's
[26:32] without blemish and without spot a
[26:34] sinless innocent lamb
[26:36] which we recognize is the image in
[26:38] genesis 3
[26:39] right it's even the image that's in
[26:41] genesis 4. you're like wow this this
[26:44] image and we've covered these in this
[26:45] past year this image is very strong in
[26:48] the scriptures
[26:49] of this sacrificial lamb and this
[26:51] covering and the blood that is shed
[26:53] and so there's a lot that we could use
[26:55] in this vein and i felt very comfortable
[26:56] today backing out a lot of the different
[26:58] scriptures i had because i wanted to
[27:00] make a little bit more progress in this
[27:02] now notice some of these statements that
[27:04] brother brandon makes and this is
[27:05] certainly not exhaustive
[27:07] on this particular subject and the world
[27:09] is again falling apart he says we
[27:11] celebrate this 25th day of december
[27:14] for the birthday of christ but of course
[27:15] anyone knows that it wasn't christ's
[27:17] birthday that was the roman sun god's
[27:19] birthday that when the church was
[27:21] converted into or brought into
[27:22] catholicism was formed at the council of
[27:25] nicaea
[27:26] and skipped a little bit and it was the
[27:27] sun god's birthday and they just taken
[27:29] the son of god and made that his
[27:31] birthday to blend it in with their pagan
[27:33] tradition
[27:35] and it no means at all being christ's
[27:38] birthday
[27:39] he could not been born at that time
[27:42] because judea is about the same high up
[27:45] on the equator as this is we find out
[27:46] that in judea in the winter time 25th of
[27:48] december she's blizzardly and cold and
[27:51] she can be there can be snow during this
[27:52] time
[27:53] shepherds cannot be on the hill and many
[27:55] reasons that it couldn't be a lot of
[27:57] historical things that point to travel
[27:59] would have been restricted during this
[28:00] time just in general the very fact that
[28:02] i look to it says they're calling the
[28:04] people to be taxed they speculate this
[28:06] this would not have been a good time if
[28:08] you're taxing people don't do it at the
[28:09] time where it's the hardest to travel
[28:11] when the roads would be impassable
[28:13] there'd be a lot of rain or snow or
[28:14] inclement weather that would keep them
[28:15] traveling do it when everything is
[28:17] perfect right so the roads are clear
[28:19] they can get there and they can pay
[28:20] their taxes
[28:21] and so he says it couldn't be and then
[28:24] when he was now this is the key here and
[28:26] then he was was nature born like all
[28:28] other nature he come forth in the spring
[28:32] usually when the lambs are born in the
[28:34] spring and he was the lamb
[28:37] and notice this he says i believe he was
[28:39] born myself march april or somewhere
[28:41] along and there in the early spring
[28:44] recognizing he sees this march april i
[28:46] believe somewhere in there he's born in
[28:48] the early spring why because his birth
[28:49] follows nature
[28:51] and he comes as a lamb behold the lamb
[28:53] of god that takes away the sin of the
[28:54] world and so he's we see this in
[28:56] scripture and so even if we kind of
[28:59] backed off a little bit and we didn't
[29:00] want to say thus saith the lord or this
[29:02] is an absolute scriptural truth we see
[29:04] that him coming in the nature of a lamb
[29:07] that we would see this symmetry for god
[29:09] to allow him to be born in a time when
[29:10] lambs are born but that wouldn't stumble
[29:13] us we could see god allowing those
[29:15] things to line up
[29:20] and then also we find in the message
[29:22] god's gifts always find their places
[29:24] notice he says my march or april is kind
[29:26] of a time frame he uses
[29:29] he says he was a lamb and i believe that
[29:31] in the in that way being altogether
[29:33] nature and lambs are born in march april
[29:36] and somewhere along and there not later
[29:38] than may and you'll find that in the
[29:41] language he's using that when people are
[29:43] even somewhat of fixing a specific
[29:46] period of time it's march april may that
[29:48] a lot of the early church arrived at is
[29:50] when the possible time was they would be
[29:52] born so the earliest references are in
[29:54] april and may so he's saying march april
[29:56] but not later than may he says and i
[29:58] don't believe it was anything before
[30:00] march and anything after may some time
[30:02] along in there
[30:04] now brother branham is not affixing an
[30:07] exact date is he not saying oh thus
[30:08] saith the lord it's april 3rd he's
[30:10] looking at a time why is he looking at
[30:12] the season why is he looking at time
[30:13] because that's the season that lambs are
[30:15] born
[30:16] in the season that lambs are born maybe
[30:18] it's in this march april time maybe it's
[30:19] in this maybe maybe even with the years
[30:22] as they pass on even if you put a date
[30:24] on it 2 000 years pass
[30:27] and you'll find that the ebbs and flows
[30:28] of dates and the different calendars and
[30:30] the that if you're not going by a strict
[30:32] lunar cycle you'll be you know what it's
[30:34] maybe at a different point depending on
[30:35] the year right as far as a calendar is
[30:38] concerned
[30:39] then in the message unveiling of god he
[30:40] says see god follows nature exactly this
[30:43] is kind of the theme you find when he
[30:44] begins to identify god is in nature
[30:47] god set the clock right when he created
[30:50] nature he set these things in motion he
[30:52] actually put the stars out there to
[30:53] begin with and that was his first first
[30:55] bible and then nature is time to god's
[30:58] clock so he's representing certain
[30:59] things in nature and the seasons he says
[31:02] see god follows nature exactly see he
[31:04] was born a lamb that's the reason he was
[31:07] born out in a manger
[31:09] why was he born into stable why was he
[31:10] born among animals why was he born in a
[31:12] place perhaps they would have kept
[31:13] animals
[31:14] and why would he be there even those
[31:16] that kind of argue about the end they
[31:18] say well it was actually a house and in
[31:19] a house they were quite small so they
[31:20] had to be multi-use multi-purpose and
[31:23] you had a place where you worked and
[31:24] then at night that's where you kept the
[31:25] animals and you had a place where you
[31:26] slept and you ate and you had another
[31:28] place for storage and they got like
[31:29] these three-room houses and you worked
[31:31] in one during the day you brought the
[31:33] animals in at night and they're saying
[31:34] they may have not stayed in the main
[31:35] family room but they would have stayed
[31:37] in that work area there would have been
[31:38] a place for a cattle and for feeding
[31:40] it's like why is he why is christ living
[31:43] there well there may be a lot of
[31:44] explanations as to why he was in this
[31:45] room but there's truth to why it was
[31:48] and one of them is a lamb is this is
[31:50] where lambs are born he says they laid
[31:52] out in a manger he says lambs are not
[31:54] born in beds
[31:56] he said he was led to the calvary let me
[31:59] just pause there too even in the
[32:01] wrapping of swaddling claws
[32:03] uh
[32:04] there's those that point to the fact
[32:05] that newborns would have been wrapped in
[32:08] claws just like that
[32:10] lambs not newborn babies but lambs would
[32:11] have been wrapped in something like that
[32:13] and these things just kind of hold this
[32:14] symbolism i came across one place that
[32:16] said that lambs that were
[32:18] bred and cut kept for sacrifices were
[32:21] born in bethlehem the very ones used in
[32:22] the temple
[32:24] that's where they would have been
[32:24] shepherded that's where they would have
[32:25] been born and that's where they would
[32:26] have been raised is even in bethlehem so
[32:29] there's a lot of things that
[32:31] people use to kind of tie into these
[32:32] things he says see he was led to calvary
[32:36] lambs sheep are lead
[32:39] so this is all part of the symbolism of
[32:41] him being born in a manger so he says so
[32:43] he was led to the slaughter because he
[32:45] was a lamb everything identified him in
[32:48] nature that's the reason he was born in
[32:50] march or april not in december
[32:54] so those of us born in march or april
[32:55] were kind of like yes this is working
[32:57] out really good it's kind of all lining
[32:59] up here april march or april not in
[33:01] december so he's taking it out of the
[33:02] time of december is in a year that would
[33:04] unfold chronologically that's too late
[33:06] in the year
[33:08] even when those uh people have looked at
[33:11] the season and the time when they would
[33:12] have the lambs out in the field um
[33:15] feeding they say it would be as early as
[33:17] march but no later than september
[33:20] and so even then they they kind of
[33:21] affixed this time period they it more
[33:23] broad but we're able to by a prophet's
[33:25] insight and by him picking up on these
[33:27] keys in scripture he's saying he was
[33:29] born in march on april not december
[33:32] he says in the message who do you say
[33:33] this is he says he'd have to have been
[33:35] in march or april because he was the
[33:37] lamb and he was a male sheep and born in
[33:40] under the the ram ares now he starts
[33:43] bringing not just nature
[33:45] but now he's bringing in the stars and
[33:47] the first bible areas it had to be you
[33:49] see and sheep are not born in december
[33:52] anyway how sheep are born in the spring
[33:55] so he points out he's born under the
[33:56] sign ares which is the ram and aries is
[33:59] from march 21st to april 19th so now
[34:01] those of us born between the 21st and
[34:02] 19th we still feel like we're in the
[34:04] lottery right like our ticket's still
[34:06] good
[34:07] we could share a birthday with jesus
[34:11] and and so the male sheep are born under
[34:13] the ram
[34:14] now this time period the march 21st and
[34:18] uh april 19th corresponds to the month
[34:20] of nisan and the ancient calendar nissan
[34:23] for the jews
[34:24] and that would be what it would
[34:25] correspond to so we say march or april
[34:27] to us and brother-in-law says he's born
[34:28] in march or born in april to the jews it
[34:30] would actually only be one month that
[34:31] would be possible using that language
[34:33] march or april and so it means something
[34:35] even different if you look at it to on a
[34:37] jewish calendar
[34:38] so there's other places where
[34:40] brotherhood says he was born in april
[34:43] and there's other places where he's
[34:44] talking about in this season or during
[34:46] this time but just looking at these
[34:47] statements from these different messages
[34:51] and maybe this would satisfy some people
[34:52] just looking at it real quick it's in 63
[34:54] and 64. all post seals right if that's
[34:57] where some people want to debate
[35:00] and so you're seeing he's identifying
[35:02] and affixing a particular time period
[35:05] of when christ was born i don't believe
[35:07] he's doing it for
[35:08] some reason that we would create some
[35:10] sort of superstition or some tradition
[35:12] around it but just to understand who
[35:14] christ is now paul picks this up this
[35:17] very idea of who christ is as peter has
[35:20] said he was the lamb without blemish and
[35:22] john says behold the lamb of god takes
[35:24] away the sin of the world and in the
[35:25] future the future view of christ he's
[35:27] viewed as a lamb
[35:28] paul in first corinthians chapter 5
[35:30] verse 7 says purge out therefore the old
[35:32] leaven that you may be a new lump and ye
[35:34] are unleavened he's drawing from the
[35:37] passover when all the leaven would have
[35:38] to be purged uh this this in exodus
[35:41] chapter 12
[35:42] and he says for even christ
[35:44] our passover is sacrificed for us
[35:48] when he says christ our passover this
[35:49] phrase passover is a very
[35:51] beautiful word that's used for us it
[35:53] says our passover and we might think it
[35:55] has a word for us we think maybe of a
[35:56] holiday we think of a feast we think of
[35:58] the time for israel the feast of
[36:00] passover but it's actually this passing
[36:02] over because that's what happened in
[36:04] exodus 13 and there when we read it he's
[36:06] passing over them
[36:08] and this is um at the time of the exodus
[36:12] there's not judgment in these homes that
[36:13] have applied the token who are doing
[36:14] exactly what they were told to do eating
[36:16] this lamb at this time but the word
[36:19] that's used is
[36:20] our passover is
[36:24] he is our paschal lamb is what it's
[36:26] representing
[36:28] i mean as in many translations actually
[36:30] stated as christ
[36:33] as christ being our passover lamb which
[36:35] is sacrificed for us
[36:50] you need me to if i can i can grab
[36:52] another mic you want to try that one all
[36:54] right we're going to switch real quick
[37:09] we'll see if this one
[37:12] all right
[37:13] how brother loyal use that one when you
[37:14] lead songs and i'll i'll switch to this
[37:16] one
[37:18] thank you for being patient i'm not
[37:19] embarrassed or nervous or anything
[37:21] there's a lot worse things that can
[37:22] happen when you're standing from a group
[37:23] of people so i trust that you're not
[37:24] uneasy and uncomfortable whenever the
[37:27] sound starts messing up it's one of the
[37:29] beautiful things when you have truth on
[37:30] your side you're not really you're not
[37:32] embarrassed about what you're saying so
[37:34] there's no sense of shame whenever
[37:35] things start going haywire so there's a
[37:37] from a point of confidence here i trust
[37:39] you feel comfortable i certainly do
[37:41] but when he says for even christ our
[37:42] passover is sacrificed for us he's
[37:44] saying christ is our paschal lamb
[37:47] this is what he is he is our paschal
[37:49] lamb he is our passover lamb so paul is
[37:52] specifically saying that the passover
[37:54] lamb the lamb that is instituted in
[37:56] exodus chapter 12 that lamb was
[37:58] foreshadowing jesus christ
[38:00] to the jews they know what a passover
[38:02] lamb is they know what it represented
[38:03] they this has this very rich symbolism
[38:05] and idea to them this is what the
[38:07] passover lamb is and now paul's saying
[38:10] but our paschal lamb the lamb of
[38:12] passover is christ that lamb that was
[38:15] instituted in exodus 12 is just speaking
[38:17] about christ who's to come
[38:19] so when paul is placing christ as the
[38:22] passover lamb maybe not just as a lamb
[38:24] but now he's a passover lamb that brings
[38:26] us to a very specific time period
[38:28] doesn't it
[38:29] so now let's look at exodus chapter 12
[38:32] which is where we had taken our text
[38:34] i just think it's wonderful we're making
[38:36] very good time tonight
[38:42] in exodus chapter 12 verse 1. i may skip
[38:45] a little bit but i just have all six
[38:46] verses here to go through it says the
[38:48] lord spake unto moses and aaron in the
[38:50] land of egypt saying this month shall be
[38:53] unto you the beginning of months
[38:55] it shall be the first month of the year
[38:57] to you
[38:58] so we we are approaching a new year
[39:02] the first month of the year is january
[39:04] now
[39:05] whatever
[39:06] calendar they kept
[39:08] whatever way they were keeping time if
[39:10] they were adhering to an egyptian
[39:11] calendar if they were adhering to maybe
[39:14] a chaldean calendar or whatever it is
[39:15] they might have been using god is
[39:17] actually saying
[39:18] forget whatever
[39:20] day keeper you've been using whatever
[39:22] calendar you've been using whatever plan
[39:23] or whatever timer you've been using
[39:25] whatever way you've been keeping the
[39:26] days start all over
[39:29] and and so if they had had january as
[39:31] their date he's actually saying no it's
[39:33] not january anymore
[39:35] and so this is why the first month of
[39:37] the year is different for the jews and
[39:38] for the hebrews than it is for us
[39:40] in a gregorian or even a julian calendar
[39:43] it's different because he's saying this
[39:44] month shall be unto you the beginning
[39:46] months it shall be the first month of
[39:48] the year to you and this month was
[39:49] nissan that's the month that became
[39:52] their first month of the year the
[39:54] beginning of their calendar the
[39:55] beginning of days this is a new
[39:56] beginning this is something starting on
[39:58] over very next chapter 13 verse 4 it
[40:01] says and they came out this day came you
[40:03] out in the month of aviv
[40:06] and so it's this is would be a word that
[40:08] would be used of eve would be another
[40:09] word used for nissan and the word
[40:12] actually it speaks of this spring
[40:14] a time when things are born a fertile
[40:16] season a time of coming forth and a
[40:17] spring and forth and the month of nissan
[40:20] falls in and we may have mentioned it
[40:21] already but nissan falls in march or
[40:24] april
[40:25] for us
[40:26] so aries is march in april brother bram
[40:28] says born march or april march or april
[40:30] these different places and then here we
[40:32] see that paul calls them the paschal
[40:33] lamb of the passover lamb and the time
[40:36] of this passover lamb when it's first
[40:37] instituted god says we're gonna start
[40:39] all over with the calendar we're gonna
[40:40] start all over and we're gonna start
[40:41] with a particular day 10 days later
[40:43] you're going to do this keep it for four
[40:45] days 15 days later there's going to be a
[40:46] sacrifice there's going to be the
[40:47] shedding of blood and it's going to be
[40:49] in the month of nisan which corresponds
[40:51] to our march and april
[40:54] but to them it would be one month be a
[40:56] particular season the beginning of
[40:57] something and and i and i'm holding back
[41:00] i realized maybe tonight i might have
[41:01] had the time to do it but i'm trying to
[41:02] learn i think i'm getting more wise as
[41:04] the years unfold to not try to shove so
[41:06] much in here on a wednesday night and
[41:07] i'm saving some things for sunday
[41:09] morning lord willing but this is so
[41:11] beautiful you begin to look at this and
[41:12] ponder this and let it really stand out
[41:14] to you what god is what's being
[41:16] emphasized in this when god says i'm
[41:18] starting over and i'm establishing a
[41:20] date a point where i'm bringing you out
[41:22] of egypt and all the things that
[41:23] represents to us and all that it stands
[41:25] for i'm going to bring you out and he
[41:27] says i want you to start counting
[41:28] differently so it's going to be in this
[41:30] time march and april for us on our
[41:32] counter but to them the month of habib
[41:34] or nissan so he says speaking unto all
[41:36] the congregation of israel saying in the
[41:38] tenth day of this month they shall take
[41:40] to them every man a lamb according to
[41:42] the house of their fathers a lamb for a
[41:44] house instituting what the feast of
[41:47] passover
[41:48] and everyone had to have a lamb in their
[41:50] house
[41:51] and instituting this feast of passover
[41:52] this is what is then observed as you as
[41:55] you can as you know this feast of
[41:56] passover then becomes very prominent in
[41:58] the ministry of jesus christ so it's
[42:00] instituted now in exodus 12 here the
[42:02] feast of passover and says in the
[42:04] household be too little for the lamb let
[42:06] him and his neighbor take next unto his
[42:08] house take it according to the numbers
[42:09] of the souls every man according to his
[42:11] eating shall make your count for the
[42:13] lamb verse 5 your lamb shall be without
[42:16] blemish
[42:18] it says it shall be without blemish it's
[42:20] going to be just as peter says he was a
[42:23] as a lamb without blemish he said this
[42:24] lamb is to be sinless has to be spotless
[42:27] a male of the first year so what would
[42:30] have been very very convenient for them
[42:32] is to know that when lambs are born and
[42:35] a year later this is the male of the
[42:37] first year
[42:38] and these it would have been at this
[42:39] particular time
[42:41] and these and to the jews clean
[42:43] intervals really meant something and
[42:45] maybe we'll take a look at that uh on
[42:47] sunday says you shall take it out from
[42:49] the sheep or from the goats you shall
[42:51] keep it up until the 14th day of the
[42:53] same month there's symbolisms of christ
[42:55] crucifixion now coming to us and the
[42:56] whole assembly the congregation of
[42:58] heaven shall kill it in the evening
[43:02] and my so beautiful to see that when the
[43:03] passover is instituted this passover
[43:05] lamb is going to be killed at a
[43:06] particular time and then you come to the
[43:08] very time that christ is crucified and
[43:10] it says it's at the ninth hour he begins
[43:12] to cry out my god my god why stop
[43:14] forsaking me and it falls right into
[43:15] this time period
[43:17] in the evening time when the sacrifice
[43:20] is taking place and these steps would
[43:21] have been unfolding and it would have
[43:22] been killed and would have been offered
[43:24] that christ at the very same time the
[43:26] passover lamb is being crucified and
[43:29] sacrificed at the in the very image of
[43:32] when it was instituted
[43:36] in the talmud
[43:37] listen to this statement such a
[43:38] beautiful beautiful statement so i want
[43:40] to quote from the talmud and these
[43:41] things would be very precious to the
[43:43] jews and to the hebrews says it was a
[43:45] famous and old opinion among the ancient
[43:47] jews
[43:48] that the day of the new year which was
[43:50] the beginning of the israelites
[43:51] deliverance out of egypt should in the
[43:53] future time be
[43:55] the beginning of the redemption by the
[43:58] messiah
[44:00] this is how this is how the jews begin
[44:02] to view this time period nissan the
[44:04] first the first and the psalm the
[44:05] beginning of months that they believed
[44:07] that since this was the beginning of
[44:09] their deliverance out of egypt
[44:11] they held in their hearts the belief
[44:13] that in the future time when the messiah
[44:15] come it would happen at the same time
[44:19] to them nissan
[44:21] in our calendar march or april
[44:25] think about it
[44:27] redemption began in a cradle
[44:31] it was accomplished by his death
[44:34] and they're both lining up
[44:36] at the same time
[44:38] why because his birth connects to his
[44:40] death
[44:42] i held back to say it on sunday and i
[44:44] remember just kind of saying it a little
[44:46] bit differently but his birth connects
[44:48] to his death to the point where it's
[44:50] inseparable
[44:52] you can't
[44:53] we can't look at it without bringing him
[44:55] to view what he was born for
[44:57] and this is to me where i mentioned it i
[45:00] i i said that the focus of the mythology
[45:03] zeroes in so much on his birth that we
[45:05] create this separate identity of
[45:07] december 25th being the time when he was
[45:09] born and it's so far removed from the
[45:12] time of his crucifixion and resurrection
[45:15] it's almost become these polar opposites
[45:17] of worship and segments and these
[45:19] distinct poles within nominal
[45:22] christianity that uh become polarizing
[45:24] themselves but these altars as it were
[45:27] where people want to worship where when
[45:28] you begin to look at the truth of
[45:30] christmas it's so closely together
[45:32] connected with his death that one of the
[45:34] heirs of the myths is it separates out
[45:37] only one aspect it leaves the other one
[45:39] out of you
[45:40] i do not believe that we could
[45:41] accurately and appropriately worship
[45:43] jesus christ during this time and during
[45:45] the season if all we did was try to
[45:47] conjure up the nativity scene and
[45:50] worship him as a baby
[45:53] because that is that would only be
[45:55] focusing on on christ as a baby in the
[45:57] cradle
[45:59] and i i guess in my mind i would want
[46:01] maybe just to give more time to this
[46:03] because it has such a a beautiful
[46:06] thought
[46:06] it's not offensive if the entire world
[46:09] was forced to kneel at the foot of a
[46:10] crib or to a baby and worship an infant
[46:13] in a cradle it's easier for the world to
[46:16] worship a christ that can only babble
[46:19] it's easier to worship an innocent
[46:22] sinless harmless babe even in such a
[46:24] humble setting in a crib in a manger
[46:27] that there's no offense maybe to to say
[46:29] well this is the king let's worship him
[46:32] as a as a babe laying in a mainstream
[46:33] and i say that this is one that is very
[46:35] approachable
[46:37] you you wonder how approachable it is
[46:39] they even have a drummer boy there now
[46:43] as if playing his best the
[46:46] plane has been doing the best oceans
[46:48] drum solo you've ever heard for christ
[46:50] on the day of his cruise birth is
[46:52] somehow going to honor christ right we
[46:54] can have drummers there in the stall
[46:56] with jesus christ why because it's it's
[46:58] you can paint any picture you want as
[47:00] long as he stays in a manger
[47:03] christ is
[47:04] despite maybe the symbolism that's there
[47:07] it's it's easier it's a more inoffensive
[47:10] christ to worship
[47:15] should really ponder that point
[47:18] so in the message sirs we would see
[47:20] jesus brother branham says now jesus
[47:22] never said we read this sunday he's
[47:25] going to bring them to bethlehem
[47:27] jesus never said to the greeks because
[47:29] they can't say uh you know sirs we would
[47:31] see jesus
[47:33] and notice this imagery i just think
[47:35] it's so beautiful how brother brown's
[47:36] want us to kind of even how would our
[47:38] eyes move
[47:40] where would they be diverted like how
[47:41] would he where would he begin does he
[47:43] get out of his baby book does he produce
[47:45] his birth certificate he says that when
[47:48] they come up now just a moment if you
[47:50] want to see it i will take you
[47:52] i'll take you back to bethlehem where i
[47:54] was born and i'll tell you how it
[47:56] happened back there
[47:57] he says he never said that to him
[48:00] when they showed up he never said i'll
[48:01] just hold on a moment let me take you
[48:03] back to bethlehem where i was born i'll
[48:04] show you what happened there it wasn't
[48:06] that he pointed them to future plays if
[48:09] they wanted to know him if you want to
[48:11] know me in other words i won't take you
[48:13] back and tell you when i was born at
[48:15] bethlehem and all about it i'll point
[48:17] you to a place where i'm going to be
[48:18] crucified for you
[48:21] he had to be pointing to the purpose of
[48:23] his coming he had to be pointing to the
[48:25] purpose of why he was revealed himself
[48:27] why was the son of man being revealed in
[48:29] that moment in that time in that season
[48:32] he wasn't even going appointed to the
[48:33] events and circumstances presently he
[48:36] said i've got to point you to the place
[48:38] if you want to know me where i'm going
[48:40] to be a place where i'm going to be
[48:41] crucified for you
[48:45] i'll point you to a place where i'm
[48:46] going to be crucified
[48:49] he never pointed him back to bethlehem
[48:54] he says i he pointed them to a future
[48:56] place if they wanted to know him
[49:07] he pointed them to a future place i'm a
[49:09] little pitchy on this mic
[49:12] he pointed him to a future place if they
[49:14] wanted to know him then he says this
[49:16] this is just six pages later
[49:19] in the same message the greeks wanted to
[49:21] know jesus
[49:22] and he gave them the way to know him
[49:25] to know him not to know his creed
[49:28] not to know his word not to know his
[49:30] miracles when he says his word he's
[49:32] talking about just things that he said i
[49:34] believe but to know him
[49:36] and the only way
[49:38] and the only way you find that is at the
[49:42] cross not at the cradle
[49:45] think about the whole world taking
[49:47] everyone to a cradle right now
[49:49] christian the whole christian world the
[49:50] advent and everyone they're going to
[49:51] take you to christ in a cradle he says
[49:54] you can't find christ in the cradle
[49:58] no it's the cross you see so see he
[50:02] pointed them to a cross not to some
[50:04] creed not to some manger or a man of
[50:06] denominations but to the cross
[50:08] it's so beautiful now it's the same
[50:10] today a real disciple if you ever come
[50:12] to jesus he'll never say jesus told me
[50:14] to join so and so church he never did do
[50:16] that he wouldn't do it today no you'll
[50:18] just see him he'll point you to the
[50:20] cross
[50:22] go there and die now the cross has a
[50:24] different meaning go there you go there
[50:25] and die not just join a church not just
[50:27] get religious not just believe the
[50:28] message go there and die then you'll
[50:30] know him if you want to know him he says
[50:33] not one time did he point any person to
[50:36] any creed any denomination or to his
[50:38] birth or even to christmas not one time
[50:42] did he ever do it
[50:44] christ never pointed back to his
[50:45] birthday he never pointed back to his
[50:47] birth place he was never pointing back
[50:49] to those things if anything he fulfilled
[50:51] them and was carrying them forward and
[50:53] they're now embodied in the person that
[50:54] he is so he says if you want to know me
[50:56] you've got to find in the place where
[50:58] i'm going to be crucified for you
[51:02] this place where christ can be met he
[51:04] pointed them to a future place if they
[51:06] wanted to know him he says it's the same
[51:08] thing today he says a real disciple is
[51:10] not going to point you to some church
[51:11] joining he's not going to point you to a
[51:13] cradle even today even as message
[51:16] believers as we celebrate christmas
[51:18] we're not just pointing to a christ
[51:20] who's in a cradle and we're point but
[51:22] we're pointing to a cross which is made
[51:23] away and we're pointing to present-day
[51:26] prophecy
[51:29] not one time did he point any person to
[51:31] a creed denomination or even to his
[51:32] birth or even to christmas not one time
[51:36] did he ever do it
[51:38] that's not what he pointed to but notice
[51:40] he says
[51:41] not to a cradle
[51:42] but to a cross
[51:45] that's where you have to find them
[51:47] and part of this we want to get into it
[51:49] we invite the musicians to come we want
[51:50] to get into it lord willing on sunday
[51:52] as you see these things begin to line up
[51:54] he was born at a time when lambs were
[51:57] born
[51:59] and the time when the lamb
[52:01] was slain in exodus 12
[52:04] corresponds to that same march april
[52:06] time period
[52:08] so his birth
[52:10] was connected to his death
[52:12] his birth is now the cradle is now
[52:14] connected to the cross
[52:17] and brother braham says in the message
[52:18] the deity of jesus christ he says as it
[52:20] was in the days of noah so will it be in
[52:21] the coming of the son of man remember
[52:23] this this statement became just real
[52:25] stand out to me it's what we used at the
[52:27] beginning of this series a few times
[52:28] noah had some faithful ones in that day
[52:30] god's got some faithful ones today
[52:33] the hour is coming this great drama
[52:36] setting
[52:37] men and women if the holy ghost is
[52:38] dwelling in you
[52:40] the christ that was born 1900 years ago
[52:43] came to manhood he never stayed in the
[52:46] cradle
[52:48] christ never stayed in the cradle
[52:50] do you realize it's one of the that one
[52:52] of the things that's a little bit
[52:53] misleading about the cross
[52:56] is in a lot of the depictions of the
[52:57] crucifix christ is still on it
[53:02] when one of the most outstanding things
[53:03] about christianity is we're not pointing
[53:05] to a cross where our savior still hangs
[53:08] nor are we pointing to a tomb where our
[53:10] savior still lays
[53:12] but it's empty
[53:15] and brother brandon i'm saying the
[53:17] christ that was born 1900 years ago it's
[53:19] christmas day 1949 he said the christ
[53:21] that was born
[53:22] someday sometime maybe we believe in
[53:25] march or april during this time when
[53:26] lambs are born he says when christ was
[53:29] born
[53:30] he came to manhood
[53:32] he didn't stay in a cradle
[53:35] it's one of the things that the myth
[53:36] kind of cement in our minds even if it
[53:39] tries to bring christ back into view is
[53:40] he still in a cradle
[53:43] but he went from the cradle to the cross
[53:47] and then from a resurrection to
[53:48] accomplish redemption
[53:50] making redemption available for all of
[53:52] us
[53:54] when you begin to look at the life of
[53:55] christ brother branham identifies it
[53:56] here it's very striking he's saying our
[53:58] lives have to follow a parallel path
[54:01] in sirs we would see jesus he's saying
[54:03] and today a real servant of god is not
[54:05] going to point you to a cradle but he
[54:07] says he's going to point you to the
[54:08] cross he says where you go there and die
[54:12] so that you know him
[54:13] and he's saying that we who are
[54:15] christians who have the holy ghost dwelt
[54:17] inside of us he says you've got to grow
[54:19] to manhood that begins to see this
[54:21] parallel wherein christ came to his
[54:23] purpose and fulfilled what he was
[54:24] supposed to accomplish our lives have to
[54:26] follow a parallel path where we go from
[54:28] the cradle this natural cradle we go
[54:30] from a crib we go from a bassinet we go
[54:33] from crawling and walking but in our
[54:34] lives those of us who've been born of a
[54:36] woman have to ultimately go from a
[54:38] cradle to a cross
[54:41] that if the only way we're truly going
[54:42] to worship jesus christ today correctly
[54:45] during this season is it can't be
[54:47] tradition it can't be religion it can't
[54:49] be true through church membership or
[54:50] just accepting the message and listening
[54:52] to tapes on particular feast days but it
[54:54] has to be a birth where you've met him
[54:57] yourself through what he did on the
[54:58] cross
[55:00] we too ourselves have to go from our
[55:02] message cradles where we were born into
[55:04] message families or whatever we were
[55:06] born into but some point in our lives we
[55:08] have to find ourselves at the cross
[55:12] and really we shouldn't count our lives
[55:14] from the cradle
[55:15] but from the cross
[55:18] that's where it begins
[55:21] when we begin to point people
[55:23] in other words we wouldn't count our
[55:24] birthday on the day that we were born
[55:26] but we count our days from when we found
[55:28] him at the cross
[55:29] that place where we died and we were
[55:31] born again
[55:33] because jesus himself did not
[55:36] focus us on and orient us to
[55:38] on this day
[55:40] april 6 or on this day september 11th on
[55:43] this day may 19th on this day march 25th
[55:46] this is the day that you must worship me
[55:48] for the day in which i was born but he
[55:51] left it at the cross
[55:54] because that's where all of us can meet
[55:55] him and be born again
[55:58] we all share different birthdays in the
[56:00] natural
[56:01] we produced our passports we'd all maybe
[56:04] identify for many different countries
[56:06] and regions and places of birth we have
[56:08] different places of birth we have
[56:09] different places dates of our birthdays
[56:11] we all share in these differences but
[56:13] when we meet him in the cross we all are
[56:16] born in some way as a paradox the same
[56:19] day
[56:20] right
[56:21] because you weren't saved on any
[56:22] particular day here
[56:25] but that
[56:26] translates you into eternity
[56:29] how could you have a day in eternity
[56:31] what day is it what's today
[56:35] thousand years later what days it's
[56:36] today
[56:38] what was it yesterday today
[56:40] what is it tomorrow today
[56:42] that's why jesus christ is the same
[56:45] [Music]
[56:46] and that's where we find him
[56:48] that's what we find is such a beautiful
[56:49] narrative that begins to unfold
[56:52] as that we ourselves and this time i
[56:53] think it's so important when we're
[56:55] celebrating the birth of christ
[56:57] to find out and to ask ourselves
[57:00] has he been born in me
[57:02] let's stand tonight
[57:08] 136 different years that christ was born
[57:15] and different beliefs and slants on
[57:17] christianity different sex and
[57:20] religions
[57:21] that have affixed the birth of christ in
[57:23] every single month of the year
[57:28] maybe in some paradoxical way we have a
[57:30] body of christ that is made up of
[57:31] believers who have been born again
[57:34] at all different times different places
[57:37] different times of years
[57:40] but ultimately at one
[57:42] share in the same experience
[57:45] to be sealed with the holy ghost
[57:48] that's one thing i certainly would want
[57:49] to put before you tonight
[57:51] and in these things is to remind you
[57:53] that we believe
[57:54] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:57] we believe in the new birth
[57:58] not in tradition
[58:00] not in just the honoring of days and
[58:02] weeks and months but in truly meeting
[58:04] god face to face and being born again
[58:06] as you pondered over the next week or so
[58:08] week and a half as we lead up to
[58:09] christmas
[58:10] begin to ponder the symmetry of the
[58:12] birth of christ with his death
[58:15] you begin to see a beautiful mystery
[58:16] unfold
[58:17] let's bow our heads our gracious
[58:18] heavenly father
[58:21] as we stand in your presence this
[58:23] evening
[58:24] we are most thankful
[58:26] for this blood which was shed for us
[58:29] for the sacrifice of your son jesus upon
[58:31] the cross
[58:34] on mount calvary
[58:36] in golgotha
[58:38] blood was shed
[58:42] first
[58:43] expression upon earth was in the garden
[58:47] when a lamb was taken innocent slain
[58:49] bloodshed
[58:51] clothed stitched together and adam and
[58:53] the woman
[58:55] driven out of the garden with bleeding
[58:58] lamb skins draped upon them
[59:04] that's the image as they left the garden
[59:06] but lord the very first image
[59:10] the other side of the garden
[59:13] abel's offering another
[59:16] lamb it was pointing to lord
[59:20] this redemptive redemptive work of a
[59:23] sacrifice
[59:25] and lord i know there's very powerful
[59:28] songs at this time
[59:30] that we sang that your son was sent to
[59:33] give us the second birth
[59:36] and the joy and the peace and the
[59:38] redemption that was in his birth and
[59:40] even the tremendous even modern day
[59:43] christmas songs of a baby born to die
[59:45] lord it thrills us to ponder this but oh
[59:48] god beyond the poetry beyond the
[59:50] symbolism father may it be a reality to
[59:52] us
[59:53] that yes this is what is represented
[59:55] during this christmas time
[59:58] as you were sending a lamb to earth
[1:00:02] that we might be translated out of death
[1:00:05] into life
[1:00:07] that this lamb had come this aries ram
[1:00:10] would come and blood was shed
[1:00:12] that in believing and accepting this
[1:00:14] atonement we could be born again
[1:00:17] and that's the mystery of your first
[1:00:18] coming everything is shrouded and
[1:00:20] confused and so much lore and folklore
[1:00:22] and theology has covered it up but yet
[1:00:24] lord we begin to see such a beautiful
[1:00:26] truth preserved in your word
[1:00:29] and lord even then in the days of your
[1:00:31] first coming is we would not be pointing
[1:00:34] back to a cradle back to a cradle but
[1:00:36] jesus was pointing forward to a cross
[1:00:38] could we not then in this day with the
[1:00:40] benefit of that life blood which was
[1:00:42] shed for us now tabernacling in our
[1:00:44] flesh could we not point forward to the
[1:00:46] time
[1:00:47] when death itself will be placed under
[1:00:49] our feet
[1:00:51] could we not also be pointing to a place
[1:00:54] where you meet us today
[1:00:57] and that that would even be part of this
[1:00:59] christmas mystery
[1:01:02] is that wise men still seek you
[1:01:05] but they find you in your simplicity yet
[1:01:07] again
[1:01:09] the very things you hide yourself behind
[1:01:11] there is where you're going to reveal
[1:01:13] yourself
[1:01:15] and that we do not have a message that
[1:01:17] merely mimics what the rest of the world
[1:01:19] says whether it be well he's actually
[1:01:20] born in april or well we just know that
[1:01:22] he was born and he's born a lamb but
[1:01:24] today in this hour this present time
[1:01:26] that we're living and we see you
[1:01:28] unveiled once again
[1:01:32] and tabernacling behind skin
[1:01:35] may these be the things that we rehearse
[1:01:36] in our minds and our hearts and
[1:01:38] encourage one another with during this
[1:01:39] season
[1:01:41] and i pray lord that you bless us
[1:01:43] tonight we're so grateful to see many
[1:01:44] out here in the house of lord of
[1:01:46] different visitors that are with us may
[1:01:48] you bless them
[1:01:49] be their portion
[1:01:51] comfort the heist family the propolis
[1:01:53] family
[1:01:54] apostolic christian church lord during
[1:01:56] this time of loss
[1:01:58] may you just do some beautiful things
[1:02:01] for them over these next several days of
[1:02:03] mourning and the funeral that's soon
[1:02:05] coming may there just be
[1:02:07] such a supernatural
[1:02:09] move amongst the people
[1:02:12] oh we love you tonight we're so grateful
[1:02:14] to be together
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:16] seal these things in our hearts and
[1:02:17] amplify them to us as only you can in
[1:02:20] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:02:21] pray amen
