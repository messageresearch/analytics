TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're continuing on the subject of the house of the Lord and I've just had a few services in this subject so far each one I believe stands on its own in terms of the subject matter that we are expressing uh the first one was taken from psalms 27 where David says one thing have I desired and we were looking at whether or not we have that Central focus and aim as a Believer the one thing desired that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and so kind of set the scene for just how important the house of the Lord is and something to be desired and then we looked at it from the standpoint of um seeking after that place by him that place where we could see him and then on Wednesday night we were looking at a home with three rooms and some of those things that brother brandham said that God dwells in a free room house so kind of those pieces there I think this morning it's not necessary that you have heard the last three services to get anything out of this one but I definitely am building and tying some things together and today I want to speak on a home for heaven that might be a little bit uh strange in the wording there but you'll understand just exactly the emphasis by the time we're finish today a home for heaven as we've been looking at the house of the Lord we've looked at it as a Tabernacle in the wilderness also the temple in Jerusalem when the Bible refers to a tabernacle the word is a tent so it's a Dwelling Place a place that someone would live when it's referred to as a temple and this place uh where they worshiped it speaks of a sacred sacred ground or sacred place and so as we're looking at a tabernacle and a temple and those things I want you just to keep this thought in mind a home for heaven and how these things might relate together now in Hebrews chap 10:5 it says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me now this statement of a body that's that has prepared me as we're ending Wednesday night we're pointing out how that God did desire a building made with hands it wasn't his ultimate wasn't the tent in the wilderness the ultimate wasn't even the temple in Jerusalem he didn't want a Dwelling Place made by man but he actually wanted to dwell in man he wanted man himself it wasn't what man could do but it was man himself that God wanted and so as we see the ultimate desire that God had we realize then that the Tabernacle and the temple and the elements thereof uh God is using to tell the story of the Redemption of mankind we say well the Tabernacle this was a wonderful thing and the temple what a wonderful thing and all the elements and all the types and all the Shadows if we just look at it as itself as being an entity and an end all that we're missing that God was wanting to portray his ultimate desire in those things even as brother bradam says that the Creator expresses himself back through creation and so God was expressing himself in Genesis 1 and 2 then God is expressing himself in those things that he asked man to build in the temple and the Tabernacle and I forgot to mention it's good to see the Martins back you made it you don't look lay overed or anything you look fresh and spry and ready to go so God bless you welcome back uh welcome home so God is using the house his house on Earth as a way of telling us a story and portraying something it says in Exodus 25:8 and let them make me God speaking now let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them build me a house so I can live with you build me a place on Earth so that I'm a God that you worship I'm a God that you're aware of I'm a God that has made himself known and it may seem as if I come and go and I visit or I'm up on top of a mountain and the prophet has come to see me and uh there's different things that kind of Express a uh Express itself uh as God visiting but now he's saying make me a place so that I can dwell among you make me a place among you and brother brandom so if I could say this then before we go further maybe his review when he's asked him to make a sanctuary he lays it out in a very specific way and we were looking at on Wednesday night how that the Tabernacle and the temple were a house which has divisions in its Arrangement It's Not A House Divided but there is an outer Court there's a holy place and a Most Holy PL place and so you'd see that there's this outer court that is actually sets a perimeter and within that was a tent and that tent had two comp apartments and we looked at that there's like three rooms in this house and brother Brandon piggybacks off of that distinction that God made in this Sanctuary that he would dwell and brother bramman the sermon Fellowship says you only live in a three- room house God lived in a three- room house right soul body and spirit God lived in a three room House Father Son and Holy Ghost so we have three rooms God has manifested in these three offices father Son and Holy Ghost he pointed out uh how that even in Christ that was there's three rooms to him and you live in a three- room house the spirit comes to a three room house justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and you live in a three room house natural first you have the kitchen next you have the Parlor next you have is the bedroom notice the young couple before they complete in that fial love what's the first thing they make a promise one to another they get married and they live in this three room house now you might have two bedrooms you might have an extra dining room was it Wednesday night he said you might have eight kitchens or something like that and I just love that hyperbole just to get our attention but he says you might have an extra dining room but you still only live in three rooms it's kind of dividing that the place you eat the place you Fellowship the place you the private place the place you sleep he's just showing that there's essentially says one place no matter how many pantries you have you only live in a three- room house he says but you only live in three rooms you're living in this body is a three room house soul body Spirit everything anywhere you want to go through nature or whatever more it all comes to those three God is perfected in that number three amen so God dwells in a three room house and where God says make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among you there's something to that Arrangement and so there there is something that God wants to express in us to us in that pattern if I'm dwelling in a three- room house it it must mean something even as uh it wasn't until Moses had erected the the tent around and the walls around the outer court that the Holy Ghost came down and God came down and to that Holy place and identified himself and the glory of the Lord filled up the sanctuary once that structure was complete why did why didn't God just do it as soon as the Ark of the Covenant was in there it had to come into that Arrangement so that God could be signaling something to us and foreshadowing something us that there's something in this picture that I'm trying to tell you now in John chapter 14 now we'll uh take a step further in in our subject those are some things just to get us all on the same page he says in verse one John 14:1 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me now this outstanding statement in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know now there's the what prompted Thomas to ask this the question the I don't know where you're going I don't know the way but now Jesus says in my father's house there many mansions he starts talking about preparing a place and this phrase that where I am there ye may be also and that's kind of the ultimate to be together and when he says In My Father's House brother Brandon shows us how that in my father's kingdom is the original intent In My Father's House in my father's Kingdom and this place that he goes to prepare I'd like to take a few moments to show that this this place and the father's Kingdom it it includes an eternal Heaven there there's something Eternal about this there's something about the future that he's bringing into view because he says don't be troubled you believe in God believe in me uh and he begins to point them to this future I believe brother brand and things that are to be is using this text and we're going to be drawing heavily from that sermon I and I think even future home he's using some of these elements so it gets us forward looking to the Future and he says in the sermon Satan's Eden he says in my father's house are many and he says or my father's economy in my father's plans as many palaces now I I like that statement in my father's economy so there's something about this economy HH that we think about and he says in my father's plan is many palaces I'll go to prepare a place look how long it is 1500 square miles now he's drawing from the the New Jerusalem say where is it at he has gone to prepare it he is Creator remember this he is Creator he creates all that gold the streets are transparent he is Creator he is making a place brother bam here is pointing to this holy city the New Jerusalem that comes down from God out of heaven in Revelations 21 John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with me men now remember the Bible says here that there is no Temple there because we see um now the full realization we preach there no more Shadows the full realization of what the temple and Tabernacle represented and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their god notice how much that answers to what Jesus is saying in John 14 uh know that I am in the father and the father in me a a and there's this idea of that's coming together this permanence this future that's pointing to the Future so brother bam is taking in my father's economy or in my father's plans he's a Creator who's going to bring forth this holy city the New Jerusalem where God will be resident with man forever and this is an eternal heaven in the sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity than revealing himself in the same he's speaking of this time in the eth day then the true son of David will then come to his Temple the temple of God the real Tabernacle which is gone away to construct now I get you thinking about some things for he said in John 14 in my father's house are many mansions and I will go what did he mean by that it was already for ordained I'll go to prepare a place for you and will return back to receive you unto myself and of course we know that'll be in the great age to come this this is showing us that future that Eighth Day that Eternal day the unending day and the true seed of David will take the throne which is Jesus Christ and there will reign over the church as his bride in the house with him over the 12 tribes of Israel throughout all eternity this is the brother brand I'm taking John 14 and showing us that when it begins to talk about in my father's house are many mansions that it brings into view something that is permanent that is forever and that is ultimately realized in that Eternal Eternal home in heaven now still focusing on this statement in my father's house we know that heaven is associated with God in my father's house are many mansions so we think of God in heaven we think of Heaven in eternity and so this Heaven is associated with God It's associated with our future we often we think about heaven it's a it's a place in the chronology that we go to later right when we think of Heaven it's something f future in Luke 11:2 and I was going through all the places which in where Jesus said uh my Father which is in heaven which is in heaven the Father in Heaven Father in Heaven God in heaven over and over and over again so we associate heaven with the place that God dwells in Luke 11:2 he's teaching how to pray he says when you pray say Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth amen so there's God who is in heaven who has a will that is going to accom be accomplished the way things are he says thy kingdom come thy will be done as it is in heaven let it be in earth as things are in heaven let it also be in Earth and when he says Our Father which art in Heaven uh uh it's the Greek word is uranos and it's so speaking to uh speaks of elevation for the sense of something being elevated translated to sky or air it's the idea of elevation and that's something and I don't want to get sidetracked on this but we know the God God is associated with the mountains and and even the temple is built on the mountain Mount Mariah and it's called The Temple Mount or the mountain of the Lord so there the the the rising and the ascending of a mountain is significant uh just in the Jewish culture and it it's the pill the Bible speaks of the pillars and so it's as if these mountains are the pillars of the earth supporting heaven so it's the it's the mountains that go up this idea of elevation that the heavens are beyond that and so Our Father which art in heaven in this sky or this air or it's more of the idea that he's higher than us he's not on our level he's not we're not looking at him face to face as it were so this is a God who is above he's elevated and brother bman the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride think let your will be done in heaven as it is in as it is in heaven let it be in Earth he quotes again John 14 in my father 's house are many mansions in my father's Kingdom there many palaces there's him bringing in that uh emphasis his Christ is there under the construction of this New Jerusalem now now listen close don't move don't don't miss this Christ is in heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem there is there is then in the sense of time where he says this now that you set thinking of what has been what is and what will be he says don't miss this Christ is in heaven so it's a sense that it's Dominion higher than the one we're in one that we can't see one that we can't touch one that we don't even enter into by physical means or distance but he's saying Christ is in heaven preparing the New Jerusalem so then we see that there is a heaven that we have a future in because Christ is there preparing the future home he's preaching the future home and this is what we're looking forward to and this is why we as Christians have a language when we say I have a home in glory and and that we have a desire to go to heaven and we begin to speak about a translation and we speak about the eighth day and we speak about eternity and and we sing and The Poets have written and we say here maybe mentioned every once a while oh I want to make Heaven my home one day when I go home to heaven and when I reach that Shore and when I cross over and I'm there at the Jordan and it's all this idea of this journey and this progress out of time into eternity and the ultimate and I and I want you I I would hope that you would agree that there is this desire to be in heaven there's this desire for what is future I'm not not necessarily wanting to be in heaven now uh uh in in time just kind kind of continue I want the permanence I want the eternity I want I want to leave this earth and be in that Eighth Day this is this is a desire that we have brother B talks about how with with our five senses of our body it contacts our Earthly home so we make our way through Earth through these five senses and then we kind of understand Nature by the five senses of the spirit but then he says we have this sixth sense of Faith down in our soul and that's given to us to contact our Heavenly home so we have things that relate to Earth as a home but then we have a faith which is kind of translates us into another dimension he says and and and we're kind of translated High and now we have faith that believes that there is a home in heaven that this faith is contact in a realm beyond the one that I am now and that I want to be at home in glory I I want to I want to go to heaven which is my home I don't belong here that's my home brother man talking about the believer says inwardly when you're born of the spirit of God you become a supernatural being in there and that supernatural being hungers and thirst for its Heavenly Home Yonder so this this natural person may be concerned about what we eat what we drink what we'll put on where we're going to sleep how the house is going to be arranged and what kind of furniture we have and the things we have in our wall and how clean the house is and and that's just what we do CU these five senses contact this Earthly home and help us navigate it in this body but faith is longing he says for a Heavenly Home Faith isn't connected so much with the Earthly house it's not connected so much with the the elements of Earthly things but faith is connect Ed he says with the Heavenly Home Yonder in the sermon things that are to be I may try to slow down a little bit here in the because I if you can go back if you have time to listen to this brother Bram is talking about how that just before this and he continues to amplify it a little bit later too that when a mother is expecting and a mother and father are expecting a child they make preparation for that that child's arrival and they get the room ready and they buy certain things and and they're preparing themselves for that child's arrival into this world to into its Heavenly home and and he begins to talk about how that God is anticipating your arrival and that in things that are to be that God has sought out very carefully the things that are to be that future home anticipate in your arrival and that there is and he said he said think about it how God put the mountain Mountain out here and arranged nature and how some of you like it this way and some like it that way and God was even thinking about this that God was providing why you were here and if you provide the beauty you love and enjoy and things you enjoy here how much more has he not already been proactive and and forward looking to prepare things for you that you're going to love things that are to be and and and he's using that example of Parenthood begins to think and prepare before even the arrival and he says we should behave ourselves and act like Christians our conduct should be like Christians because we are aliens here this is not our home no we're just put here temporarily we've got to go every one of us tonight now think if God in his Mercy has the mother before the little baby's born it's craving for some vitamin and the mother's words speak forth dad I want canalou or watermelon I want something another so he's referring to how that the woman will crave certain things eat a certain way and it's all for the development of the the baby that's inside of her and there's this uh she craves and she Longs so she's nurturing and feeding this baby and says wow he'll do everything he can to get that because he knows that he wants his child born as perfect as it can be he'll do everything that he's able to to get it now there's the the the the natural Mom and Dad anticipating the arrival of this child into this realm into this earth into its heav and its Earthly home but brother Ram's using it maybe in an interesting way he's using the sense that here we are in the womb of the world in the womb of natural life and but one day we're going to be translated into Eternal born into an eternal realm Eternal Kingdom Eternal home he says how much more abler is he to get it all right if we'll do the things that we need to and the prenatal care and all the things ensure that the baby is born healthy and we're so concerned about it how much more abler think of all the things that a mom will do and a family will do to make sure that that baby is is going to be healthy on not can't eat can't eat um deli meat too much of nitrates in it and can't do this and can't do that what it's looking out after the baby as it develops so that it arrives perfectly and if we do that in the natural and we spend so much money and do so much care and take all these classes and we get a birthing plan and we go to the hospital and there's a lot of things that maybe we do cuz we want the baby to be were born right he said how much more abler how much more abler is God as he anticipates our arrival into this other dimension and these things that are to be he says he's a Creator I remember how we read earlier how brother Brandon was saying he's Creator In My Father's House in my father's economy in my father's plans he's gone to prepare he's Creator he's making a place he said here he says he's a Creator now think how able he is to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live and now he brings it to us there's something in US calls to live and there's something in us that calls to do right that's why he says as Christians we have to live and act right and because we have that desire as the mother would say oh get me cantaloupe dipped in pickle juice and smothered with peanut butter or what however it is we exaggerate those things today uh that there's this idea that the craving is going to meet some need now he's saying that we cry out and he says then God will call somebody on the platform or the pulpit that'll preach the absolute truth so what is it God is doing when he uses the man of God behind the pulpit answering to even your unknown Cravings answering to what you have need of to make it to that Eternal home perfect the preaching of the word here is equal to and is it like a mother who watches out over what she eats knowing that the baby is going to be fed that nutrients and wants a perfect arrival in that into this world how much more abler is God to know what you need and the preaching of the word is God answering to what you need not so much even today but tomorrow in the future wow preach the absolute truth why it shows you the absolute truth shows you so then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me this is a preparation for the translation for that to go to that Heavenly home as he's calling it here says it's need he says why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's gone on to prepare amen you've got to be a real word bride of Christ and because we've got to be a real word bride of Christ the word is preached and then even as some on some level of maturity cuz listen we know that when we were first hearing the word of God we might have been standing there holding something the word of God came and just gone it's gone what happened the Holy Spirit just starts to cut away but there comes a certain point in our journey with God where he just says Let It Go and you're going okay yeah yes Lord I'll let it go right and he's not going to he's not going to rip it out of your hand he's not going to do it yeah the word's going to come and then you're going to have to say Lord get take these things away from me I'm I'm relinquishing I'm letting go because it's needed now we're not talking about how to win your way to a new birth says it's needed for your heavenly home so the preaching of the word is God answering to what you have need of now as a son and daughter of God to be in that Heavenly home that you're going to the word now is matching what he's gone to prepare there's still a preparation for the people that he's preparing the place for so if the it's a word Kingdom there that we're going to there's a word here now building the kingdom in your heart giving you the things that you need so that you can fit there because that's where you belong because you're not going to be there temporarily you're only here temporarily and so the things that he's given you that are Eternal are more important than the temporary elements that we feed on to make our lives comfortable in a temporary realm so it's the word that we're feeding on that's making us a real word bride of Christ and we ought to have an attitude say that's really what I need preach the absolute truth to show me what I need not so much to have a good Monday everybody hates Mondays I think is what they say but there's a it's it's not just to have a good Monday it's have a a good Eternal day and and and I hope in and speaking it this way it's kind of changing even the whole point and as we ministered on uh uh the Heaven's mystery and Earth's Glory was this idea of kind of getting us to think more about the reality of this life what it means in the next life so to where we're just not on a treadmill here I we're just well I'm just living you know H home yeah just trying to make it through and the rewards going to come one day and one day one day one day well when you just this statement alone is enough to kind of shatter that Paradigm there is an eternal Heaven There is an eternal home and right now God's preparing me so that I'll fit there you say well I got a perfect Soul that's right but you're a three- room house you don't want to have a really really nice uh as one person said the crown jewel is the powder bath in any home you don't want to just have a perfect powder bath to all the visitors to see that's his house he wants it right not only on the inside but on the inside of the inside the man within the man of the man that three room house he wants it all right and so he's not going to judge you if it's not right he's going to send the word to make it right Hallelujah so Jesus says I go to prepare a place for you a place he's saying where I am with you that where I am there you may be also it's pointing to this heavenly condition as brother bam said we're just put here temporarily even as Israel would have seen this God coming down the mountain and different instances where it seemed as if God was visiting the children of Israel now when Jesus says that where I am there you may be also it's to remove this idea of a yoyo and he visits and he goes and he visits and he goes and we see him now he's gone but it's this idea of a Heavenly permanent condition now having establish that let's look at the Tabernacle and the temple in Exodus 15:1 17 because he says I got to I go to prepare a place for you this place there's as even Moses said show me thy glory and God said there's a place by me in the Clift of a rock in this PL secret place in this elevated place that there's this uh there's so much uh tradition that they could just wrap up into this idea a place where he is it says in Exodus 15:1 17 Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance in the place oh Lord which thou Hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary oh Lord which thy hands have established now there is Israel would dwell within uh the children of Israel would dwell within Palestine within those borders there's ways that you could even type out how that would there's even a and I think there's ones that constructed this way were this the element of even Israel Jerusalem Tabernacle of those that arrangement of you have the whole Promised Land then you have the holy city then you have the the temple therein and but yet here we see that there's a place that is made for God to dwell in the sanctuary which thy hands have established it's a place that God dwells there's a number of scriptures we could have used but I want to kind of zero in on this idea that God chose a place on Earth make me a sanct uary make me a house that I may dwell among you then the Bible says in Psalms 11:4 the Lord is in his holy Temple the Lord's Throne is in heaven the idea of a king the king a king and priesthood being brought together the idea of the palace and the temple being brought together the Lord is in his holy Temple his holy Temple we could even say is represented by that little room inside the tent of the the tent of meeting the Tabernacle there I'll I'll meet you and it says the Lord is in his holy Temple but it says the Lord's Throne is in heaven this idea again of associating god with heaven and his Temple and his Tabernacles is Heavenly and that's where he is so when God was made a place in the land of uh Israel or in the promised land he made a was made a sanctuary that Tabernacle that was there in the wilderness and then in uh Israel and the temple that Solomon built it represented now an image of Heaven and Earth that the Lord is in his holy Temple his throne is in heaven that we would see this shadow the the that would see the shadow of God who's in heaven uh his throne is in heaven but now he's in his temple in Earth and it's just it's the bringing together of Heaven and Earth the holy of holies is then even a a shadow of heaven and we went through this and great detail U at some point last year I can't remember when I think it was last year how that the structure of the tabern corresponds to the structure of Heaven and Earth to an Israelite this is in their their their MRA they're writing the midra they're writing about these I'm trying to remember now just exactly which one that it's in they're said the structure the structure of the Tabernacle corresponds to heaven and earth and the holy of holies is represented as heaven now I I hope I hope I can get this far this morning now catch this you have the outer Court where everyone can go the car get ation can go then you have the tent that has uh a holy place where only the priests can go and then you have the most holy place where no one goes but the high priest so a you have this General realm where everyone can be but then there's those who leave that realm and they go into a holy place and then there's only one that can leave that other place and go into the most holy place the holy of holies so the holy of holies then represents that that heaven where God is amen and in that place where God is it's catch this part it's sealed off from you from all the outsiders from all those in the outer Court they can't just go right and look into the most holy place you know there's no peing it's sealed off from View and in that way we we know we know there's a heaven just as an Israelite knew there was a Most Holy place but they don't ever they've never seen it they never gone into it they're not even allowed to go in there they can't go in there and so for us we the same way that heaven is sealed off from our view we don't see heaven we don't know heaven we don't enter into heaven but the holy of holies was the dwelling place of God on Earth where he visibly manifested his glory in Exodus chapter 25 again verses 21 to 22 and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat upon the AR above upon the ark and in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I will meet with thee and will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel and for H School assignment I want the uh elementary school kids to diagram that sentence so he says there I will meet with thee and will commune speak declare utter forth command promise even warn it's really very multifaceted what he means but it says there I will meet with thee it's a place of meeting where has he told us he'll meet not in the Holy place not in the outer Court not outside the court but there is a place that I will meet you and it becomes a sacred meeting place between the cherubims Psalms 80 vers1 give ear oh Shepherd of Israel thou that leadest Joseph like a flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth think of that there is this sacredness to that uh that area above the ark Above The Mercy Seat that's where the presence of God is amen I I think it's just a language that we hear so often that maybe we don't take time to really think about maybe even how kind of Mystic that seems you know there just and there's just you know God is dwelling between in this place but this is what God says now there's a reverence to that to the Jews said we believe that God this this Supernatural one this endless one dwells there in the most holy place in the holy of holies and this is an image of Heaven yeah in heaven God has manifested in his full Glory he's worshiped endlessly even literal cherubs and the the worship that he's given and if I could say this the maybe say this way the reason why it's called Heaven is because God is there there's no God there it's not heaven we might actually call that hell but we make our bed in hell if it's us that's there there he is with us he says so there's this idea that this is what makes it Heaven Every Mountain Top isn't Heavenly unless we would say that there was like heaven or we could say God is on the mountain that makes it a lot like heaven and so God in heaven is manifested in his full Glory worshiped endlessly and so God dwelling above the mercy seat and the holy of holies is receiving worship even in the the the gold that's being laid over and the Cher Bone's being expressed it's an image of heaven and it was there in the holy of holies that he received an offering he received worship so this made the Temple of the Tabernacle What's called the most holy place or the holiest of holies it made it heaven on Earth or Heaven in Earth it would have this type or this image and I I don't even want to water it down by just saying well it's a type it's a type no God was there so when that high priest once a year passed through that Veil into heaven or into the most holy place it was an image of a man cleansed and prepared with the bloody sacrifice going into heaven before God to present the offering that was required this is the way that they even viewed it so Leviticus 16:30 says for on that day the day of atonement the priest on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord so as we've looked at before the day of atonement cleansed the Tabernacle itself the place but then it's for the cleansing of the people so there was a preparation for the place and for the people of that place the people that would come into that outer Court those who would come for offerings to be made and what's being described in Leviticus 16 is that day of atonement when the high priest entered the holy of holies through that Veil The Veil Between Heaven and Earth as it were to present the sacrifice it was as if the high priest now was entering into heaven to show the sacrifice had been made before God for the cleansing of the people so that Paul says in Hebrews chapter 9: 11 and 12 but Christ being come a high priest of God excuse me high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building yes amen now that that to the Jews the Tabernacle the Tabernacle the temple the temple the temple but now a more perfect Tabernacle for Christ is not entered into the hly place places made with hands well excuse me I'm skipping I'm skipping later it says neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us now he doesn't mean that Christ slipped down off the cross and snuck into Jerusalem and went into the most holy place and RI the veil of the temple no he entered into heaven and there as the lamb in the same image as the whole the the high priest would have taken the sacrifice in behind the veil and sprinkled the blood and presented it before the Lord now the lamb has become a high priest that's just it's all coming together it's all coming together Amalgamated together accumulating up cuz now the high priest is the second sacrifice the blood the sacrifice the priest every element being expressed he's entered into the holy Place verse 23 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these so they this is the showing that they purified the elements and the utensils and the things in the Tabernacle which were a pattern of heavenly things they purified it with blood but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands there's your whether you're talking Temple or Tabernacle whether you're talking Shiloh or Jerusalem which are the figures or the shadow Shadows of the true but Christ has entered into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us Christ as the high priest as the lamb as the bleeding sacrifice when he entered into heaven he went in Beyond the Veil and was presented this conquering king of glory entered into heaven to say it is finished that I have done I I must be about my father's business and business is finished I've made it now into the holy of holies not made with hands but now I've entered Beyond the Veil and now I'm in eternity and as a figure of everything that had been now he's the substance of the Shadow and now he is as it was on Earth the most holy place now he's entered into the most holy Place Heaven made it Christ has entered into heaven itself in the presence of God for us so God is in heaven we see him as above us Christ now becomes our access to God because he's in the presence of God for us sacred meeting place we don't have to go to Jerusalem we don't have to go to Jeffersonville we don't have to go somewhere some special Tabernacle or Temple he says he has appeared for us is in the presence of God for us so in Hebrews chapter 10: 19 and 20 having therefore Brethren boldness all right amen are you awake you follow me think about what Christ did he appears in the presence of God for us he's entered not into the holy places made with hands not in the blood of bulls and goats but he has now by his own blood entered into the most holy Place heaven to attain ET obtain Eternal Redemption for us so we see Tabernacle Temple and all the sacrifices and all the ceremony were were a telling the story of redemption Christ has now brought the full substance of the Shadow amen and we accept that with Christ but now brothers and sisters having therefore boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus H okay Christ has entered but now we have the boldness to enter into the holiest Christ has entered not into a holy Place made with hands but into heaven itself into the holiest of holies the most holy place now he says we have boldness to enter into the same place by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which Heath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh I go to prepare a place for you and he says the way you know and where I go you know I am the way the truth the life no man cometh to the father but by me Christ becomes the way into the presence of God into heaven itself as it were Hallelujah brother Brandman telling that story how a woman craves things to bring forth the child in a perfect condition for its Earthly home how much more abler is God to do it because he's a creator I'm G to pick up where we stopped he said it's needed the word he brings he says it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to going to where he's gone on to prepare now again we've kind of approached this from the idea that in my father's house there many mansions and we think future we think eternity he says you got to be a real word bride of Christ immediately he says I was preaching a few nights ago on the sacrifice in the days of the atonement now we all in the same place kind of see these things kind of now intersecting and weaving together I was preaching on God's provided place of worship God's only provided place of worship I was preaching on the only place that God the only church that God will meet a man in and that's in he said the place that he put his name he said I won't meet them in any other place but the place the gate that I put my name in now he don't meet you in the Methodist gate Baptist gate or Pentecostal gate or any of them I'm not going to make a statement I'm going to ask a hypothetical you can discuss them amongst yourselves would he meet in a brandom gate I mean what Gates does he meet in but he put his name in his son he said I came in my father's name let's pause for a moment take this in come on take it in think about what he's saying here think of all the element all the things we're thinking about now he's saying the place where I put my name and we just think maybe Arizona believer's Church there it is right in our minds we're thinking the name we're thinking of a name we give a place and we try to think of a way to memorialize it be saying in the place that I put my name brother said that God prepared himself a body in the form of the Lord Jesus so it says I where I the place that I put my name and we're just thinking name tag appalation nomination we're just thinking of something that we use linguistically to identify someone as being not being someone else right like I think George Foreman named all his kids Georges and georginas or something like that it's like so there's probably a name he's also given them so he can know all the Georges differently in the georginas and that's what we think a name is but there's so much more to the name go back and read it don't have time to do it today and and I took some of these verses out and maybe we could expound upon it in a future service but in Deuteronomy chapter 12 he said when you entered the promised land you tear down every Grove every Idol every Church everything to a false idol he says the place where they put their names and so there there's something to a place of worship that it's named the idol this is where the idol is this is where the idol is this is where the God is and he says but you know what I'm not the same way you can't just direct the an altar anywhere you want to for me you can't just hang something on a tree and say you're worshiping me no I'm not the same way like these other guys who can just hang up a shingle anywhere and claim to be worshiping God you can't worship me anywhere but where I put my [Music] name so Deuteronomy 12:11 then shall there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there amen now that's different place we put your name you're just going I slap a name tag on it right it's like when you sit down to eat and you haven't quite prayed yet but there's a really good piece of meat there that you want or piece of pie and you have to sing Happy Birthday per first or whatever it is so you go I want that one right there right you kind of named it you've claimed it you've identified it you've done something to mark it so we kind of thinking a name is just kind of like I think one of my brothers did one time they went out and bought a thing of milk and some cereal and they put on it my milk my cereal nobody touched and my dad was kind of like I could have been doing this the whole time right I didn't know I could do that and that's what we think about name but now it's used in a different way cause my name think more about a name than just a Aaron you got to think more about it cause my name to dwell there and there you shall bring all that I command you there you bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices there you bring your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which you vow unto the Lord this is the place he says the place that I put my name is not just some place where I snap SLA the first church of whatever or I called it a tabernacle I called it a believing Church no the place that I put my name that means the place that I dwell because it has my name because I'm there how why is heaven called God's home because he's there and the reason why he put his name there cuz he's there cuz the false gods they could just put a name on any tree right didn't didn't matter if they were there or not cuz they're not real so he said the place that I dwell this is my household the place that I put my name so when Jesus said I came in my father's name it's not that we get kind of hung up on the idea of well it's just the name as we were reading the other day writing in the book of Acts says that Josh Jesus brought him into the promised land and he's just using the Greek for Joshua but Jes Jesus Christ was the substance of the Shadows of the temple it was God in flesh God in a body and how is it that he came in his father's name because he dwelt there Jesus said he came in his father's name but if the father never came to dwell in them it's a false Temple it's a false idol just as empty empty as all the other Groves and all the other buildings and all the other altars but the place that he puts his name is the place where he dwells and Jesus says I go to prepare a place brother BR says he's pointing to God's economy our father's economy with many palaces and we think our Heavenly home but where we stopped reading in John chapter 14 is if you ask anything in my name I'll do it and and he's saying you believe that I'm in the father and the father in me the works that I do shall you do also then brother B says Greater Works where it's an end time promise end time prophecy John chapter 14:1 15 beautiful brother we'll read verse 15 to 23 because now Jesus continuing he's told him believe in me let not your heart be troubled now we all start looking one day we're looking to the future he says if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him now what do you see there the temple the world can gather in the outer court and some out of that could even be in the Holy place but only those elected and ordained the high priest once a year had a right to see what was behind the veil in the Holy of holies and Jesus says the world does not see him just like nobody else could peer into the holy Place nobody else could peer into the most holy place he says the world seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me amen Brethren having therefore boldness to enter into not a tabernacle made with hands not the outer Court of the Tabernacle in the wilderness not the outer Court of Solomon's Temple not even the holy place of the temple in the Tabernacle not even the holiest of the holies of the house made with by hands but into heaven itself which you see and the world does not see World seeth me no more but you see me because I live ye shall live also you don't have to worry about that high priest who would go in behind the veil and could die at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you brother B said that day is this day that Christ is the mystery he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him hopefully you can come back to this concept this idea of Love there and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto him not a scariot lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not under the world isn't that kind of what the whole Temple Tabernacle thing was all about a place where he would manifest himself arranged in the middle and all the Israel is arranged in orientation to the Tabernacle not to the world the world's all on the outside outside the camp and then Israel's arranged out of and now this Temple this Tabernacle is now in the midst of it I says how is it he says ' if a man love me he'll keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him amen John 14:2 in my father's house are many mansions house Kingdom domain in my father's house there are many mansions now he says we will come un him and make our Abode with him maybe it doesn't come as any surprise to you but that word is we'll make our mansion with you it's the same word a dwelling a staining and abiding so Jesus is saying there is a place that we're going to but lest you be discouraged unless you get your mind too much looking onto the future this home he's talking about and we'll make our home with him or we'll make our Abode with him in my father's house are many mansions but if you love me my father loveth you and we will make our Mansion oh Hallelujah one day you're going to a mansion but will before you ever get there we'll make our mansion in you that's not a far Kingdom that's not way off down the line that's not just a longing and a hope so and one day it'll be yeah that might be so as this Soul Longs for the eighth day but I hope it kind of gets turned around a little bit he says there is we will come to you and make our mansion in you you catch it though he speaks of a house of many Mansion or a a kingdom with many mansions and a future home there's a present home good in the Old Testament God made his home in the Tabernacle yes he made his home in the temple yes there in the wilderness there in Palestine there in Jerusalem in the New Testament as we spent some time looking at and we've already alluded to we'll do a little bit today God's home is his church in eternity Christ and his bride in the New Jerusalem there the future home will be where hereen on earth in every instance God makes a home on Earth you know what Eden was yes God's home on Earth why did he make it some even speculate in the Jewish tradition that the uh Garden of Eden was a mountain in Paradise there a place where where man dwelt with God it was Heaven in Earth so if I can say this as we bring this around to just our closing Lane making Heaven our home is a high ambition right it's a great aim it's a worthy goal something we're aspiring to it's something we realize is actually taking place when the word is preach say God preaches the word to us because he sees what we have where we're going and what we have need of to meet go there perfect and and Def fit and belong as we use our senses here to contact our Earthly home if if a baby was born into this world missing a sense then it's something's going to be missing in this Earthly home so God now is making this proper development of our faith and the full Perfection of our faith so that when we get there we can perfectly relate and have that perfect realization in our Eternal home so that is a a wonderful ambition it it it it must be in our hearts but let me say this there must be another goal right we've got to have another ambition and that is to be a home for heaven in Ephesians chap 2: 19-22 I'll read this maybe we'll just expand on it on another time now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens and Saints and of the household of God and to a Jew they you know they could kind of rub their curls and they could you know yeah that's right we understand how that a gentile can can can become a proelite to our our religion being the family of Faith as it were but then it's like Paul just has this way pushing a little bit step further and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so thinking okay we can see the images here we can see in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are build it together for inhabitation of God through the spirit what is Paul trying to convey and express to us as we said that in this new testament and in this time and age that we're living in now in this Gentile dispensation the bride is God's dwelling place that we are now we are God's habitation we are a holy Temple we are built to be a habitation of God we're not just the household of God as a family but you are to be the very place that God dwells in my father's economy there's a plan for many homes that's his household that's his family but right now Peter said ye are Lively Stones built up a spiritual house and he says not just the temple but also the priesthood a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ am 1 Peter 2:5 as Lively Stones Living Stones your spiritual house amen now we begin to see another image that you have well you have you have the temple and you have the sacrifice and you have the high priest you have these different elements and you have the most holy place has to come before the altar the throne as it were the mercy seat and so there was something slain one who slew it one who takes the blood of it and presents it into heaven but now you have Christ both lamb and high priest comes into heaven to offer up sacrifices andless I get kind of lost in this part here but now you actually have you in whom dwells the high priest washed in the blood of the lamb now you are the temple and you are the priest and you are the kings and God is now just combining every image and element of the Kingdom into his bride I can say this we should we should desire heaven we should have a Rapture bust mentality we should have a longing to leave but let me say this we need conf context David the one thing we can't just have one thing desired and we have this idea I just want to go in the Rapture and and I know that sounds right and it is right but without proper context what do you mean is that why you're driving 100 miles an hour with no seat belt right is that why you're ingesting 800 milligrams of caffeine before lunch you know you just want to go to Heaven by any means necessary there's a point at which you realize well maybe it's not just I want to get to heaven we could all just drink Kool-Aid if that's what we were thinking but we we must have context and this is the context I want to give it now and I know I I said this is kind of still building this closed we only desire Heaven listen to me we only desire heaven and we only desire to be in eternity even as natural creatures because God first desired to have a home if God didn't first desire to make man his home then man can never desire to have Heaven as a home God desired man to be his Temple God desired man to be his place of rest and if God had never desired a home you could never desire a heaven as the Bible says we love him because he first loved us our love to him is only born from the fact that he loves us that deep calling to him is only there because the Deep already called to us first brother bam said we're going to life and real eternal life we're going to a heaven we're going to a paradise we couldn't desire it if it wasn't already there but now I want you to think the heaven that was already there it's heaven and it's not that it longs to remain in heaven but it was longing for something and as much as we ought to desire and long to go to heaven let me say it must be the utmost in a sense that we've got to have that desire but let me say this it is only exceeded by God's desire for a home Lord and our desire to make a home for heaven should at least be as great as our desire to leave amen or something's missing you listening let that weigh a little bit our desire to leave whatever that is our desired to make a home for heaven beautiful must at least be the same amen David said one thing have I desired of the Lord Psalms 27:4 that will I seek after that I may go to home to Heaven sit on a cloud playing a harp David doesn't say that that I may dwell in the house of Lord all the days of my life he in this he says that speaks of the land of the living he's not thinking afterlife he's not thinking of Eternity he's not thinking of Heaven it chases his Catholic mentality that we're just here to pay do Penance we're just here to suffer Walk On Our Knees to their bloody give all this to the church and do all sorts of things and this life is just a life of slavery and drudgery and pain and all the self-inflicted things and misery and backslides listen the most consistent theme with modern worship music today is I'm sorry I smoked a blunt last night and cheated on my wife but I'm just so glad that you're a beautiful God and you're so amazing right they're more concerned about having a house of worship than they are themselves being a sacred meeting place of the Divine and it more glorifies and lifts up the the cycle and the ups and downs but oh one day we're going to go to heaven where I don't have to worry about this anymore and I don't have to make mistakes we've got to get out of this mentality and this idea that I'm here until I die and have this attitude that David did one thing have I desired of the Lord and now will I seek after that while I'm living I can dwell in the house of the Lord to inquire in his Temple to behold his Beauty Hallelujah why cuz brother bam said the Earthly things only express what the Eternal things are and that this Earth that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if that if this here is the expression of one that's dying it's only expressing one that's Eternal Hallelujah that's more real than this one we're in now then what ought we to have is a desire not just to go to heaven but to make Heaven a home I don't just want to make Heaven my home I want to be a home for heaven now amen Brothers if you could come to your instruments last statement from the sermon presence of God unrecognized you know what the trouble today there's people many people with the people there's people many people with the people that belongs and just go to church and have a Creed that's it they just go to the house of the Lord they go to a house of worship see they've seen so much just false so much just statues and so much of a big fine buildings could it be that that's really no different than all the altars and Groves and places of worship that littered Palestine before God told them in Deuteronomy 12 go and tear them all down and not every man can just erect his own altar there's going to be one place I put my name brother says let's never get off in that kind of a tantrum God don't dwell in big buildings he dwells in your heart God don't dwell in intellectual education he's far from it so if you thought I was reading this just to justify this church building which even a guy short like me look at that uh these are 12T ceilings for those who watching online I just so you know I'm not reading this to justify myself you don't dwell in intellectual education this is not he's far from it he dwells in humility Simplicity God dwells in humility in your heart he dwell in his word and his word comes into your heart and speaks itself out and declare he interprets his own word through you he's trying to find somebody he can get a hold of to show that he is still God and not just God of the mountain not just the god of Jacob not just the god of William brandham the god of the Bible the god of Heavens but a God who wants to get a hold of you because he wants your heart to be his home and yes we want to go to heaven and we can sing brother when we get to heaven won't we be glad we can sing when we all get to heaven When the Saints Go Marching In and we can sing a lot of songs about making Heaven our home and I got a home in glory land but all of that is nothing but an empty Altar and false worship unless we're making a home for heaven now in our hearts amen and hopefully Wednesday night we'll expound upon a little bit of where these how much more we can do this but we've got to have the context I only want to go to heaven because God wanted to come to Earth and make his home in me not just with me but in me let's make that our ambition stand with me today and we'll pray together
