[0:00] like to give a quick review of the
[0:02] simple life we ministered on that I
[0:04] think it was just a couple parts um we
[0:06] could have maybe stayed in that channel
[0:08] a little bit in looking at the simple
[0:10] life and I'll just recapture some sc one
[0:12] scripture and one statement uh we were
[0:15] looking at I've been studying from the
[0:16] message Harvest Time and there's some
[0:19] really key statements that brother BR
[0:20] makes in that that we're very familiar
[0:22] with and how we are the reflection of
[0:23] the message of the hour and it's Christ
[0:25] being lived out through us and it's the
[0:27] life and so we see that Christ is now
[0:30] expressed in the lives of his people not
[0:33] just in the lips of his people not just
[0:35] in the thoughts of his people but in the
[0:37] life that we live and so it's the uh
[0:39] that Harvest Time theme and some of the
[0:41] themes we've been looking at in an
[0:43] honorable home and the simple life is
[0:46] how that it's the Simplicity of
[0:48] obedience to every word of God now I
[0:51] know that when we say the Simplicity of
[0:53] obeying every word of God immediately
[0:55] it's a paradox and we don't know what to
[0:57] do with it but it that is what God
[1:00] wanted to do is Express himself through
[1:01] flesh and he can't do that apart from
[1:03] his word and the theme has been Satan
[1:07] targets where God is expressing himself
[1:10] and how that he is scheming to stop the
[1:12] word of God from being made manifest or
[1:14] God's word from being fulfilled and
[1:16] that's his schemes his attack his Target
[1:18] is always to keep the word of God from
[1:20] being fulfilled now Satan is not trying
[1:23] to keep uh the Messiah from coming as a
[1:26] sacrificial lamb he can't do that it's
[1:28] already happened say st's not trying to
[1:30] keep the children of Israel in bondage
[1:32] in Egypt that uh they've already been
[1:34] delivered and so he's not trying to keep
[1:36] the Jews out of their Homeland they're
[1:38] back there's a lot of things we could
[1:39] say prophetically that Satan uh has
[1:43] attempted to thwart or to stop or probed
[1:45] at and tried to figure out but he's
[1:47] failed in all those things so we're not
[1:49] uh we don't want to be historical but we
[1:51] want to understand things present tense
[1:53] yet looking back historically we can see
[1:55] that Satan is always fighting against
[1:57] Revelation cuz he hates revelation
[2:00] because he's trying to keep God's word
[2:01] from being fulfilled I meant to provide
[2:04] this statement for you I don't think I
[2:05] did but it's from the Harvest Time
[2:07] brother Bram says on the three
[2:09] Temptations of Jesus the three
[2:12] Temptations of ministers where they make
[2:14] their fall three Temptations of the
[2:16] church where they make their fall three
[2:18] Temptations of an organization where it
[2:19] makes it fall and three Temptations in
[2:22] the individuals where they make their
[2:23] fall so we could say wow preachers need
[2:26] to watch out for money women and
[2:27] popularity uh and we might read identify
[2:30] those as uh three Temptations for a
[2:32] minister but he says there's Temptations
[2:34] for a church an organization and
[2:36] individuals so no matter where we are uh
[2:38] there's a VIN diagram where we fit in it
[2:41] a and that we have got either we have
[2:42] nine or 12 or whatever we might be we've
[2:45] got Temptations we need to deal with and
[2:47] chances are those three are the same for
[2:49] each one they just come in a different
[2:52] Channel or different way because we know
[2:53] that all that is in the world is the
[2:55] lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh
[2:56] and the pride of life that is summed up
[2:59] in the temptation of the woman in the
[3:00] beginning it's summed up in the
[3:02] temptation of Christ in the wilderness
[3:04] as we just read about it and brother B
[3:06] says watch when you get into the end
[3:08] where the Temptation comes so we could
[3:10] see that the Temptation whether it be a
[3:12] minister a church an organization or
[3:14] individual is going to come through
[3:16] those channels it's going to be in that
[3:18] subtle seducing way and we've been
[3:22] making the point that the tempting of
[3:24] the woman the tempting of Christ
[3:26] identify Satan's schemes today and his
[3:29] Eden today
[3:30] that what he was doing then he's trying
[3:32] to he was trying to accomplish something
[3:33] in this end time so Paul makes this
[3:36] statement and let's look at this
[3:37] scripture together and this has been it
[3:40] has been this scripture that has brought
[3:42] me into this channel in 2 Corinthians
[3:44] 11:3 but I fear lest by any means as the
[3:48] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[3:50] subtlety it's the most dangerous
[3:52] approach it's the most H A Dangerous
[3:55] attack as he has beguiled Eve seduced
[3:58] her through his subtlety so your mind
[4:00] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[4:03] that is in Christ it is corruption from
[4:06] the Simplicity that is in Christ it's
[4:09] that phrase there to me that has just
[4:11] been has driven me into looking into the
[4:14] word of God looking into the message of
[4:15] the hour to understand what this
[4:17] Simplicity of Christ is and we recognize
[4:21] through a number of things we could say
[4:23] this that Satan is wanting to still
[4:26] beguile the body of Christ away from
[4:30] the Simplicity that is in Christ and
[4:33] Paul says I fear and not that he feared
[4:35] inappropriately and not that this was
[4:36] not uh an attribute of the love that he
[4:39] had for the Corinthian Church but he
[4:40] feared that as the serpent beguiled Eve
[4:43] Satan would also begu the church and in
[4:47] the beguiling or the seducing it would
[4:49] corrupt them from again the phrase the
[4:51] Simplicity that is in
[4:54] Christ that's uh at the Forefront of our
[4:56] thoughts and last Wednesday it may have
[4:59] been very uh rich and very uh dense in
[5:01] terms of how that overlays with prophecy
[5:04] in this hour and how it overlays with
[5:06] the message of the hour and how that
[5:08] even though we would look to and believe
[5:11] very significant things have happened
[5:13] and transpired in terms of the
[5:15] Fulfillment of scripture it still comes
[5:17] down to living the
[5:19] life a a and being humble and these
[5:22] different attributes it comes back to
[5:23] the Simplicity the Simplicity that God
[5:26] hides himself
[5:27] in I've been thinking it just seems like
[5:30] more and more as it comes to me
[5:32] meditating on a lot of things from day
[5:34] to day in our prayer life and the
[5:36] different things that we're concerned
[5:37] about even in our own homes our own
[5:39] personal lives I've been
[5:41] thinking a lot about as we've ministered
[5:44] on just the Simplicity of everyday life
[5:46] and home life and our relationships with
[5:47] one another and the atmosphere we create
[5:49] in our home there's a lot of things just
[5:51] about even the minutia of everyday life
[5:53] but I've been thinking about it in terms
[5:55] of what it means to be restored to Eden
[5:57] or to an Eden condition and this
[5:59] restoration of the Garden of Eden is
[6:01] coming back to Eden as it's so
[6:03] pronounced in the message of the hour
[6:06] I've been thinking a lot about that and
[6:09] I think it has I'm hoping tonight in
[6:12] some
[6:13] ways that the concept of being restored
[6:16] Back to Eden can be more practical in
[6:18] our everyday lives and we're not just
[6:19] looking for uh some sort of trip back in
[6:22] time to whatever it was for the man and
[6:24] the woman but yet there's something that
[6:25] God's wanting to bring to us and restore
[6:27] to us in this hour and and I I feel like
[6:30] maybe there's something missing in that
[6:31] explanation but it's at the at the core
[6:33] of my heart now I will say this I
[6:36] apologize that it's on a Wednesday night
[6:38] after 7:30 but you might want to wake
[6:40] yourselves up I think this is going to
[6:41] be kind of dense some of you might feel
[6:43] like you're getting a classical
[6:44] education others might feel like you
[6:46] didn't want to take Greek mythology in
[6:47] college and now you are but we're going
[6:49] to get into some stuff but we're going
[6:51] to do it under the guidance of the
[6:52] message of the hour so my title is this
[6:55] is part one of the
[6:57] labyrinth and in and that's my my title
[7:00] this is my title slide and uh so uh
[7:04] brother Scott's not here so I don't have
[7:05] my help when it comes to Latin I I might
[7:08] have spelled it wrong Labyrinth is a
[7:10] weird word to begin with but uh that's
[7:14] this is the concept everybody familiar
[7:16] with the the concept of a a labyrinth
[7:19] like a puzzle or a maze is what some
[7:20] people might call it but in chapter 7 of
[7:23] the church age book brother brandham is
[7:26] writing and he's talking about that
[7:28] particular age and he comes to this
[7:31] place in the church age book where he
[7:32] refers to John Amos cenus and he was a
[7:36] 7th Century theologian he was a reformer
[7:39] and he wrote a work in 1668 called Unum
[7:43] necessarium and there's different ways
[7:45] it's translated but brother Bram
[7:46] translates it to one thing
[7:49] needful and you may be familiar with it
[7:51] it's in the it's in page 254 in the
[7:53] church age book it starts out on the
[7:56] last full paragraph I think it's
[7:58] paragraph three and if you're just
[8:00] reading it you might think well this is
[8:02] what brother brandham these are brother
[8:03] branham's words through uh brother Vil
[8:06] or these are words that brother Brandon
[8:07] Penn but as you look at it he speaks of
[8:10] uh comenius and the one thing needful it
[8:12] was originally in Latin and he wrote
[8:14] some other works uh many Works he's
[8:17] actually very renowned in many different
[8:19] ways I think he's considered the father
[8:20] of modern education not as a Bad Thing
[8:23] necessarily but uh he's quite a reformer
[8:26] but as you read through it you'll find
[8:27] there's different quotations
[8:30] uh on page 255 they end all the way in
[8:32] page 256 and you might have heard the
[8:35] statements read before and you thought
[8:36] these are brother bram's words but he's
[8:38] actually uh uh it doing it a different
[8:41] kind of translation maybe than some
[8:42] other ones but he's quoting commenius
[8:44] from this what he calls one thing
[8:46] needful or one thing necessary is how
[8:49] others might say it but it's uh this
[8:52] he's quoting from these this
[8:54] writing and so I want to walk us through
[8:57] this Unum necessarium about comenius and
[9:00] this use of the labyrinth that brother
[9:01] Brandon refers to in the church age book
[9:04] anybody here want to raise their hands
[9:05] and say yep I've read that I'm familiar
[9:07] with brother talking about the labyrinth
[9:08] in the church age book we got a f a
[9:10] whole family that's heard it before very
[9:12] good chur what's that went to their
[9:14] church I was actually going to maybe
[9:16] just have a little conversation about
[9:18] that because some of his most pronounced
[9:20] writings in 1631 to 1638 were all
[9:22] written in check and so um that's kind
[9:24] of neat we'll have to talk about that
[9:26] later isn't that the picture you sent me
[9:27] that one time see if you guys just
[9:29] excuse us for a moment we're having a
[9:32] moment and so in the uh in the Unum
[9:37] necessarium when he begins to get into
[9:39] what he's talking about he opens up this
[9:41] is where he starts he starts off with
[9:43] creation and he uses very rich language
[9:46] to describe it and and he's saying how
[9:48] that man was made in the image of God
[9:50] he's made in the likeness of God and he
[9:52] was made a God on Earth and he was given
[9:56] a three-fold duty and he's just kind of
[9:58] summarizing things and this is the
[10:00] three-fold duty that he gave man it's
[10:02] the duty of contemplating things to
[10:04] learn what each one is and I provided
[10:07] these just so it might make it easier
[10:09] for you um to zone out but make it look
[10:11] like you're paying attention but it's
[10:13] the first is the duty of contemplating
[10:15] things to learn what each one is so
[10:17] there's things in God's creation that
[10:20] man was placed upon Earth and there was
[10:22] all sorts of great intricacies and
[10:24] complexities of his creation there was a
[10:26] lot of things for man to consider Ponder
[10:29] if you want to use that word and there
[10:31] to he was to contemplate and then learn
[10:34] from God's creation what each thing in
[10:36] God's creation was and we recognize that
[10:38] creation came from the word of God and
[10:41] and this is commenius his words and he
[10:42] says then he has the duty of working
[10:44] something out of them that as he learns
[10:47] in the contemplation of things he's to
[10:49] work something out of them in other
[10:50] words he's to adapt uh them for his use
[10:53] or in some way or another that he's as
[10:56] he learns things he uses them because
[10:58] God provided them for some use that God
[11:01] had a reason for them and I guess I will
[11:04] say this cuz I'm sensing already uh I'm
[11:07] drawing this from where brother brandham
[11:09] pointed it to and he quotes from this
[11:10] huge part these different parts from
[11:12] this part in this uh Unum necessarium
[11:15] and I'm just drawing from this brother
[11:16] Brandon put his finger on it and I'm
[11:18] just drawing from and giving some
[11:19] background from the for the statements
[11:21] that brother Brandon makes in that
[11:22] church age book and then this third one
[11:24] the duty of using and enjoying them for
[11:27] pleasure now I will say say this I'm not
[11:30] I'm not offering this to you for you to
[11:32] agree with for you to say Amen or that's
[11:34] the absolute truth sharing with you what
[11:36] commenius wrote and then you let the
[11:39] Lord can kind of Quicken to you how
[11:41] that's applicable in your life how that
[11:43] might line up with scripture or how you
[11:45] would balance it out with the word of
[11:46] God but this is how he viewed it that
[11:48] man had a three-fold duty of
[11:49] contemplating things in order to have an
[11:52] understanding that he might use those
[11:53] things or work something out by them and
[11:55] then using them in a way that would give
[11:57] them pleasure and this is all all the
[12:00] the right kind this is according to the
[12:02] will of God so he makes this statement
[12:04] and you follow this because I think this
[12:05] is very good he said God planted a
[12:07] paradise of pleasure which he had
[12:08] created for man to name them by I I
[12:12] don't remember that part in it but you
[12:13] go back to Genesis chapter 2: 19 so it
[12:16] was Adam then was going to be standing
[12:19] there some things were going to be
[12:20] brought to Adam he was going to look at
[12:22] him and in the words of comus he was
[12:23] going to
[12:24] contemplate he was going to look at how
[12:26] God made them he was going to look at
[12:28] their uh unique traits and maybe what
[12:30] they did and their different
[12:32] characteristics and through
[12:33] contemplation he was to name each animal
[12:37] so there was a process that God was
[12:40] putting the man through to where he
[12:41] wasn't just you know rolling the dice or
[12:44] or just drawing names from a hat he
[12:45] wanted man to to to think and to process
[12:48] and to understand and wrestle even with
[12:51] the image that God was bringing before
[12:52] him so be based upon his conclusion that
[12:56] in Genesis 2: 19- 20 he led all the
[12:59] animals uh as part of his work for him
[13:01] to name them through contemplation he
[13:04] said so it follows this is his
[13:05] conclusion it follows that the happiness
[13:07] of man consist now this
[13:10] is uh you think about this for our own
[13:13] lives that's really what I I don't want
[13:15] us to miss out on this this is not
[13:16] historical or hysterical the purpose of
[13:19] this is for us to think about our lives
[13:21] the context of our lives today in
[13:23] Satan's Eden and how mankind has been
[13:25] wrestling with this and how that the
[13:26] word of God is the answer for it he says
[13:29] so it follows that the happiness of man
[13:31] consist in the clear light of the
[13:33] intellect for correctly observing the
[13:36] differences between things in the
[13:38] favorable outcome of actions for
[13:40] producing good works in the secure
[13:42] enjoyment of good things for the true
[13:44] satisfaction or saity of the mind and
[13:47] quiet for the quietness of the mind for
[13:49] peace now I know this this is written in
[13:51] Latin then translated to English but
[13:53] maybe we could look at it in the sense
[13:54] that the happiness of man is tied to his
[13:58] Clarity of mind
[14:00] in being able to discern between good
[14:01] and evil know what's right and know
[14:03] what's wrong in that are just observing
[14:05] the differences between things and that
[14:07] there be a favorable outcome in his
[14:09] actions so you recognize what he's
[14:10] saying that it's good that a man would
[14:12] have be of a sound mind and that there
[14:15] would be a favorable outcome of his
[14:17] actions for producing good things and
[14:18] good works and that in that he would
[14:22] enjoy he he would have this security and
[14:24] he have quietness and peace a Peaceable
[14:26] habitation and quiet resting place and
[14:29] these are ways of just even describing
[14:31] what Eden was supposed to be this
[14:33] paradise of God now this is man is he
[14:36] was originally intended to be then
[14:39] commus says that through the fall of
[14:41] humanity there's now a three-fold
[14:43] unhappiness so as you've been writing
[14:44] this down H you'll be tested on this
[14:46] later you won't get a free Knife Set or
[14:49] Parry knife though that there is a uh is
[14:52] there is a three-fold duty of man and
[14:55] then this uh the happiness of man
[14:58] consisting in these three thinks he says
[14:59] there's a three-fold
[15:01] unhappiness now this is this first one
[15:04] is are are my words as I tried to um
[15:07] interpret it I guess or summarize it but
[15:10] the frustration of
[15:11] thought and how he describes this is
[15:14] these are the this is a man's threefold
[15:17] unhappiness that of thinking clearly and
[15:19] being able to observe differences
[15:20] between two things is part of man's
[15:22] happiness then the frustration of
[15:24] thought or errors in thinking are part
[15:26] of man's unhappiness he calls
[15:29] hallucination or the falsity of the
[15:31] intellect to where we're we're we think
[15:33] we're smart we're intelligent and the
[15:35] mind figures things out and sees things
[15:36] but he's frustrated because there's
[15:38] heirs in his thinking some of our most
[15:41] renowned behavioral uh scientists would
[15:43] say these are biases these are the her
[15:45] istics in man's mind which causes him to
[15:48] think one way but in real the reality is
[15:50] different it's the falsity of intellect
[15:53] and I see these things is kind of
[15:54] building together because of the
[15:56] frustration of thought there's the
[15:58] frustration of
[16:00] enjoyment man has a tendency to uh
[16:03] overestimate how much he'll enjoy
[16:06] something I'm starting to summarize a
[16:08] bunch of stuff now but then do it and
[16:11] then overestimate uh underestimate how
[16:13] badly they hated it after the fact this
[16:17] is going to be great this going to be
[16:17] wonderful it's horrible but then after
[16:19] the fact it was great it was wonderful
[16:21] and so it's just uh the the way that we
[16:23] assess value the way that we transact
[16:25] the way that we think of things often
[16:26] leads to a frustration of enjoyment and
[16:29] comius called this HS in acting so man's
[16:32] happiness is connected with the
[16:34] frustration of thought or erors in
[16:36] thinking that the frustration of
[16:37] enjoyment the erir is in acting this
[16:39] continual he calls it a continual
[16:41] exhaustion of
[16:42] strength and then the frustration of
[16:45] Desire its erors in wanting so you have
[16:48] the thinking the acting in wanting this
[16:51] is that he calls it a continually
[16:54] reoccurring uh uh
[16:56] bothersome uh uh hunger and thirst for
[17:01] desirable
[17:02] things that he he observes this
[17:05] three-fold unhappiness frustration air
[17:07] in thinking erors in acting air in
[17:09] wanting the frustration of thought
[17:11] frustration of enjoyment frustration of
[17:13] Desire these this falsity of intellect
[17:16] this exhaustion of strength and this
[17:17] bothersome lust and hunger after
[17:20] desirous
[17:22] things and he makes this statement these
[17:25] three he's referring to this these
[17:27] frustrations and these heirs these three
[17:29] have been wandering sadly through the
[17:31] whole human race all the way from the
[17:34] first man our origin because he deserved
[17:38] it he was ejected from Paradise into the
[17:40] Earth which was cursed on account of
[17:44] sin now what he's doing is he's he's
[17:47] looking at man in the present state in
[17:48] the 17th century and he's looking at
[17:50] things and he's saying wow uh this is a
[17:54] mess and he he ties it all the way back
[17:57] to the beginning and said ever since the
[17:59] fall where a man had a three-fold duty
[18:03] and that he was to find happiness in
[18:05] these three things now there's a
[18:07] three-fold unhappiness because these
[18:09] things he uses it wandering sadly
[18:12] through Humanity ever since the fall
[18:15] ejected out of paradise into the earth
[18:17] the earth which was
[18:18] cursed so he and through a couple Pages
[18:23] goes to the almost the entire Book of
[18:26] Ecclesiastes and he summarizes Solomon's
[18:28] observations and also he says the
[18:30] complaints of wise men throughout every
[18:33] age said wise men in every age have made
[18:35] these observations namely
[18:37] Solomon the wisest man in all the world
[18:40] who observed these three things that all
[18:43] the Affairs of men are confusing don't
[18:45] you like it when it's just so easy to
[18:47] take notes and you're all thinking man
[18:48] I'm just going to repr preach this when
[18:49] I get a chance but all the Affairs of
[18:52] men are confusing this is that's what
[18:55] Solomon concludes right this is some of
[18:56] his are not his ultimate conclusion but
[18:59] as he looks at things he's like the all
[19:00] the Affairs of
[19:02] men are confusing and labor is full of
[19:07] trouble I believe that as he's drawing
[19:10] from the scripture he looks at how
[19:11] Solomon is talking about it's void of
[19:13] the fruits that man would like to have
[19:14] from it because there's nothing good for
[19:16] man to do this and enjoy it but then
[19:18] what's what's left afterwards it just
[19:20] becomes this labor is only full of
[19:23] trouble and you can see how these build
[19:26] there is grief instead of joy
[19:29] and Perpetual Affliction of spirit there
[19:32] is grief and Perpetual infliction in man
[19:35] as he as the Affairs are confusing labor
[19:38] full of trouble so he has grief instead
[19:40] of joy and his spirit is continually
[19:44] Afflicted so commenius concludes Solomon
[19:46] the wisest of Mortals filled his books
[19:50] with laments of this sort he filled his
[19:52] own life however with examples of Errors
[19:55] of trouble and penitence
[19:57] penitence which look at Solomon who's
[20:00] concluding these things and he's wise
[20:01] but what does he try to do he tries all
[20:03] sorts of things to find
[20:05] happiness and he runs after so many
[20:08] things and it's from this book of
[20:09] Ecclesiastes there Solomon says Man by
[20:11] mixing himself has made himself
[20:14] miserable things have become more
[20:17] complicated and things have gotten
[20:18] bigger and out of control and he was the
[20:20] widest of all Mortals and he FS all his
[20:22] books with the Lamentations and his
[20:24] observations and Ecclesiastes and
[20:26] Lamentations and he's are not just
[20:28] Lamentations but he's lamenting in these
[20:30] things and he finds himself uh pouring
[20:33] his heart out but yet he fills his own
[20:36] life with the examples of erors of
[20:38] thinking frustration of enjoyment
[20:41] frustration of
[20:43] Desire it's at this point in Unum
[20:46] necessarium that commenius turns to
[20:49] Greek
[20:50] mythology and how that and he's he's
[20:53] doing this for a reason and I find that
[20:55] it's not it's not uh
[20:59] it's not a waste of time it wasn't
[21:02] fruitless for him to do so but it also
[21:05] even would help us to understand
[21:06] scripture because these these are the
[21:08] things that Paul was facing in his day
[21:11] the the the the Greeks and their
[21:12] mythology and even how in the book of
[21:14] Acts that they attributed they assigned
[21:17] characteristics to Paul and Barnabas uh
[21:19] uh to Greek gods and things there was a
[21:21] h uh this is the kind of mindset uh that
[21:25] gripped and held um the the Gentiles in
[21:28] that region at this time so commenius
[21:30] observes that the Greek mythologist made
[21:34] the same observations but yet they
[21:36] express them in their mythology or their
[21:39] fables so commenius uses three fables
[21:42] that he says Identify the wondering and
[21:44] unhappiness of mankind and those three
[21:47] are the cian Rocks the Delights of
[21:50] Tantalus and the
[21:52] Labyrinth ever heard of these read
[21:55] these I'm looking at the one guy I think
[21:57] that would and
[21:59] he's looking than he's looking at me
[22:00] with this you got it all wrong
[22:02] brother thank you Professor but the cian
[22:06] rocks and that's the one where the the
[22:08] he's he's condemned to just P push a
[22:10] rock up heill and it rolls back down
[22:12] again and that's just the entirety of it
[22:14] the Delights of Tantalus and the the
[22:16] Labyrinth these are ones that he is
[22:19] going to use in this Unum
[22:21] necessarium uh to
[22:23] identify in the the unhappiness and the
[22:26] wondering of mankind so he's saying that
[22:27] there's some allegory in these fables
[22:30] there's some truth in these mythologies
[22:32] that express the same observations of
[22:34] Solomon so he makes this statement come
[22:36] let us apply ourselves a little to these
[22:38] fictitious accounts of the Labyrinth of
[22:41] cyphus and of tentalus so that we may
[22:43] bring to light and better understand the
[22:45] evils of our time and swiftly apply the
[22:49] remedies doesn't that sound so inviting
[22:52] like yeah I want to read that I want to
[22:55] understand this because I want to know
[22:56] the evils of my day and I want to
[22:58] swiftly apply the
[23:00] remedies and he's wanting to draw from
[23:02] something that would be familiar to the
[23:04] academics familiar to the Greeks
[23:06] familiar to the educated and even the
[23:09] theologians of that time he wanted to
[23:12] look at fictitious narratives fables
[23:15] this mythology but bring out of them
[23:18] this this representation or this analogy
[23:21] to life so that he could understand in
[23:23] the 17th century the evils of that
[23:27] time and then swiftly apply I like that
[23:30] swiftly apply the
[23:31] remedies I believe his full title not in
[23:34] the Latin was the one thing necessary to
[23:37] know what is necessary in life and death
[23:39] and after death and I think he says the
[23:42] conclusions of an old man after he lived
[23:45] uh uh in The Labyrinth here is in his
[23:47] 70s or so and he's coming to the the end
[23:50] of his life and he's realizing man he's
[23:51] even repented of some of his Theology
[23:54] and his ideology and he's realizing I at
[23:56] times got caught up in these things
[23:59] a and was the the I was cfus and I was
[24:02] Tantalus or I was caught up in these
[24:04] this Labyrinth and now I'm recognizing
[24:06] that there's just one thing
[24:10] necessary everybody seems to be with me
[24:13] so
[24:14] far this is where it gets uh in
[24:17] particular I want to get into the
[24:18] Labyrinth a little bit that he's drawing
[24:20] from so brother brandham uses the phrase
[24:22] the Labyrinth the Labyrinth I think it's
[24:23] maybe three or four times in the church
[24:25] age book he makes reference and quotes
[24:27] specifically meanus his use of the
[24:29] labyrinth and brother Bram I Believe by
[24:31] taking out those little Snippets wanted
[24:33] us to digest that so if you say well
[24:35] brother Aaron do we need to read one
[24:37] thing necessary no I'm doing that for
[24:39] you uh it's in the church book you could
[24:41] read it I believe God could speak to you
[24:43] and give you what you need in the things
[24:44] that brother mam taught I feel led to
[24:46] get into what he taught a and bring this
[24:49] out to emphasize the truth of the word
[24:51] of God so in The Labyrinth I think it's
[24:54] uh commus may call them mytholog gians
[24:59] used even this uh mythology or this
[25:02] telling of the labyrinth as kind of this
[25:06] symbolizing the the the human life and
[25:09] how there's perplexities on every side
[25:11] and it's full of difficulties and how
[25:13] that man cannot untangle disentangle or
[25:16] untangle himself untangle himself from
[25:19] these complexities these perplexities
[25:21] and these difficulties without unless
[25:23] God gives wisdom H there's some higher
[25:26] wisdom or some other power
[25:29] now a labyrinth we may think of it in
[25:30] terms of like a uh a puzzle or a maze
[25:33] there's some distinctions I'm finding as
[25:35] I study this one they some might bring
[25:38] out on a
[25:41] uh a granular level but it's a complex
[25:45] or circuitous path you might have done
[25:48] this in a a maze Garden or some Gardens
[25:50] might contain like a labyrinth or corn
[25:51] maze might be another way you think in
[25:53] terms of elaborate but it's this complex
[25:55] circuitous path that leads from
[25:57] beginning points to a center so the
[25:59] Labyrinth kind of has a you're arriving
[26:01] at the center of something this is the
[26:03] way that it's expressed even in the
[26:04] mythology it comes from Greek mythology
[26:07] and it being mythology it's not like you
[26:09] can just go to the library and check out
[26:11] the book that was written by a man named
[26:13] Greek and it was called mythology it's
[26:16] kind of a collection a lot of these
[26:17] things have been carried for forward
[26:19] through oral tradition and Homer and
[26:21] different things but it in this Greek
[26:23] mythology it it you can take it from
[26:27] there's other ways to look it up but
[26:28] Theus and
[26:30] minitar uh and the minitar are
[26:33] the is where this story you might have
[26:35] heard it before and there's different
[26:36] ways it might be called even the
[26:37] Labyrinth or or minus the king of cre um
[26:41] these different
[26:43] mythologies now stay with me I want you
[26:46] to hear this and I don't want to get
[26:47] caught up in the too much of the details
[26:49] and trying to bring out the type but
[26:50] this is the story of the labyrinth minus
[26:53] the king of creit had a
[26:56] wife pacifi
[26:59] and she
[27:02] was well let me just say this as comia
[27:06] says she was of perverted
[27:09] lust
[27:11] and pacif in a fit of
[27:15] lust committed
[27:17] adultery and in the telling she commits
[27:19] adultery with the bull and gives birth
[27:20] to a monster now just use your use your
[27:23] minds and in terms of what is going to
[27:26] come forth and the Minotaur then is this
[27:29] unnatural offspring of a woman and a
[27:32] beast it's a half man and a half
[27:35] bull the head of a bull and the body of
[27:38] a man is that manitar that you might
[27:40] often a minitar that you often see the
[27:42] minitar would be that representation not
[27:45] a centaur but this menar as one poem put
[27:48] at the lower part of a beast a man above
[27:50] the Monument of their polluted love now
[27:53] you see the parallel that when comenius
[27:56] is going to take and use the example of
[27:59] the labyrinth for Mankind's predicament
[28:02] that goes back to the beginning wherein
[28:05] the woman is tempted and she falls in
[28:08] the garden and so in The Labyrinth and
[28:10] in this Greek mythology aesus in the
[28:13] minitar the king orders the construction
[28:16] of a labyrinth uh as punishment for the
[28:19] menur and he's going to imprison him and
[28:22] he's at the very center of this
[28:24] Labyrinth this very complex creation by
[28:27] this architect this designer who kind of
[28:31] played a very critical role even in the
[28:32] fall of the woman and the wife and then
[28:36] he's casting others who are condemned to
[28:37] death other uh Bad characters they're
[28:40] cast into this Labyrinth and in the
[28:42] story they would either be devoured by
[28:44] minitar or they would perish from Hunger
[28:47] so the minitar is there at the center of
[28:49] this Labyrinth and he feeds on human
[28:53] flesh and the the the Serpent's meat and
[28:57] eating the dust of of the earth and all
[28:58] these things you can see this connection
[29:00] back to
[29:02] scripture and so only in the mythology
[29:04] only thesis escapes the Labyrinth he
[29:06] kills minitar and so this is what the
[29:09] Labyrinth is in this telling it's filled
[29:13] with endless
[29:14] Halls so all sorts of entryways and
[29:17] passageways and staircases that go up
[29:19] and
[29:20] down and it's of this confusing
[29:23] construction so that one who is in it
[29:26] wanders about continually and never
[29:28] finds an
[29:29] exit that you follow this passage way
[29:32] and one's leading you in then it takes
[29:34] you further out and it's up and down in
[29:36] these endless halls and this uh all
[29:38] these entryways and staircases and it's
[29:41] it's done in such a way to confuse one
[29:43] so that they
[29:45] never find the center or find the
[29:49] exit and brother B makes this statement
[29:52] about commus he compares the world to
[29:54] the
[29:55] Labyrinth he compares the world to the
[29:57] laby and shows that the way out of it is
[29:59] by leaving what is needless and choosing
[30:02] the one thing needful Christ This is a
[30:05] summary of what comenius is building
[30:07] everything on if he takes time to
[30:09] explain Solomon's observations if he
[30:11] takes time to bring in the Greek
[30:12] mythology as he takes time to look at uh
[30:15] the three-fold unhappiness or the
[30:16] three-fold duty of man and what gives
[30:18] him happiness really at the end of the
[30:20] day he's trying to show that the world
[30:21] that we pleas presently live in and
[30:24] unpleasantly live in is a labyrinth
[30:29] as it were it's filled with endless
[30:30] halls and enticements and passageways
[30:32] and directions and it's confusing and we
[30:34] wonder about continually never really
[30:36] finding the source of happiness never
[30:38] really finding things that
[30:40] matter a and why is it this the world is
[30:43] so much like the Labyrinth uh in the
[30:45] mythology because the Labyrinth gave
[30:47] rise after similar acts that took place
[30:50] in
[30:52] scripture brother BR he says he compares
[30:54] the world to the Labyrinth
[31:00] and comia says for while we live in
[31:02] truth each of us has his own Labyrinth
[31:05] his bothersome occupations which in turn
[31:07] develop
[31:08] others we all have these bother
[31:11] bothersome occupations we all have these
[31:13] frustrations of thought and enjoyment
[31:15] and desire we all have our labyrinths
[31:18] that are leading us on continually but
[31:20] we never really find the satisfaction we
[31:22] never find what he said we ought to have
[31:23] the satisfaction of the mind and a
[31:25] quietness and to be at rest we're never
[31:28] finding the contemplation which if I
[31:30] could say in our present world of the
[31:33] labyrinth it's trying to steal our
[31:36] moments of contemplation a as it's been
[31:39] it's emphasized maybe even more and more
[31:41] in the secular world and in the
[31:42] Christian world and as we've emphasized
[31:43] even from this Pulpit that we are never
[31:46] bored and entertainment and some sort of
[31:49] H H uh sensitizing of the mind or some
[31:52] emotion is always at our fingertips to
[31:54] where there's no silent contemplation
[31:56] and this even entering into to and
[31:58] embracing boredom so we can contemplate
[32:01] matters and understand
[32:02] things to get the enjoyment that God
[32:05] wanted us to out of
[32:07] life and we all have our
[32:10] Labyrinth as this might seem to be
[32:12] shrouded in a lot of Greek mythology or
[32:15] academic and a lot of fancy
[32:17] terminologies I hope that in some way it
[32:19] strikes a cord in your heart to
[32:21] recognize that brother Brandon wanted us
[32:23] to see that this world has become a
[32:25] labyrinth
[32:27] and that the only way out of this
[32:30] Labyrinth where we're pursuing needless
[32:32] unnecessary things is to choose the one
[32:35] thing that is necessary and that's
[32:38] Christ so Paul writes in 2 Corinthians
[32:41] chap 11 we'll read verses 3 and 4 for
[32:43] you for I fear lest by any means as a
[32:46] serpent beg guiled e through his
[32:47] subtlety so your mind should be
[32:49] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[32:53] Christ for he that cometh preacheth
[32:56] another Jesus whom we have not not
[32:58] preached he says for if he that cometh
[33:00] preacheth another Jesus whom we have not
[33:01] preached or if you receive another
[33:03] Spirit which you have not received or
[33:04] another gospel now notice how as the
[33:07] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[33:08] subtlety and we could read in the
[33:10] temptation of the woman just how that
[33:12] played out and Yeah hath God not said
[33:14] that you shall not eat of every tree of
[33:16] the garden he says oh yeah we can do
[33:17] this we can't do that says oh you won't
[33:19] surely die and it seems to be running
[33:21] along this singular track to get her to
[33:23] see something a certain way so that she
[33:25] would partake in it and now Paul say
[33:27] says that as the serpent beguiled Eve he
[33:29] says that one could preach another Jesus
[33:32] that you have not has not already been
[33:33] preached and also another Spirit which
[33:36] you have not already received or another
[33:38] gospel which you had that you have not
[33:40] already accepted and that you might
[33:42] sustain it that you might give it life
[33:45] that you might support it that you might
[33:47] keep it going and a and believe the lie
[33:50] as it were and these things are relevant
[33:53] for the time that we're living in now
[33:54] because we got to watch where the
[33:55] Temptation comes in the end it's coming
[33:57] to these same kind of channels where
[33:59] it's another Jesus it's another gospel
[34:00] it's another Spirit but it's very
[34:04] subtle but as a serpent beguiled the
[34:06] woman in the beginning we could say it
[34:08] this way that in the paradise the
[34:09] beginning the simple life of man as
[34:12] commenius describes it even as brother
[34:13] brandom narrows it down we could see
[34:15] that man was to keep every word of
[34:19] God as reading even how that the way
[34:21] that you could uh uh just set it forth
[34:24] and in the beginning just how simple it
[34:26] was for Adam and the woman this is what
[34:29] you're to do this is what you're not to
[34:31] do they had commission and they had a
[34:34] Prohibition this is what you're to do
[34:36] this is what you're not supposed to do
[34:39] brother Bram called it in God's power of
[34:40] transformation he called it God's
[34:41] economy of
[34:43] Innocence so this was his economy his
[34:45] arrangement this mode of operation this
[34:47] system of interaction economy means the
[34:49] household management it was the first
[34:52] family it was the first home it it
[34:55] represents to us what our home lives
[34:57] ought to be like it represents to us
[34:59] what church should be it was to be
[35:00] represent uh the the paradise was to be
[35:03] representative of
[35:05] heaven heaven on Earth God's economy of
[35:09] Innocence no corruption everything is
[35:10] pure there was Freedom From Evil there
[35:12] was freedom from
[35:14] wrong that even in the prohibition it
[35:16] wasn't that evil is lurking but it was
[35:18] do this don't do that there was
[35:22] no sin as we know it
[35:25] today there was
[35:29] well let's I mean is that not the best
[35:30] way to say it it was God's economy of
[35:32] innocence and look where we are
[35:35] today and so Ser the serpents begal and
[35:44] Eve is symbolized in The Labyrinth in
[35:48] the
[35:49] adultery of
[35:54] pacifi can you see that
[35:57] I know it's crude and maybe I'm trying
[36:00] to stay within the confines of the
[36:01] message of the hour but we know what
[36:02] brother I'm taught on the original sin
[36:05] we know what
[36:06] scripturally the original sin is and
[36:09] what it
[36:10] produced and it's this very thing that
[36:12] comus picks up on himself and says that
[36:14] bull
[36:15] Satan seduced in the beginning and
[36:18] brought an Unholy
[36:20] mixing and
[36:23] now again it's pacif e is I is the the
[36:27] name of the queen or that wife of the
[36:29] king of cre minus his uh wife her act
[36:33] and that fit of lust and even as she
[36:35] tries to defend herself later and say
[36:37] why would I do that i' be crazy to lust
[36:39] after that and that's so outlandish and
[36:40] that's so bizarre the the the thing I've
[36:42] been accused of and you can see it's
[36:45] it's this image of the woman in the
[36:48] beginning Now read this together with me
[36:52] just see how commus breaks this down and
[36:54] I think it's just beautiful the way he
[36:56] outlines this had a conception this is
[36:59] the man and the woman they had a
[37:01] conception by the symbol of the two
[37:03] trees of Good and Evil life and death
[37:08] notice how he broke that up the tree of
[37:10] knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree
[37:13] uh the tree of life and the tree of
[37:14] knowledge of Good and Evil and he said
[37:16] it symbolized good and evil life and
[37:19] death he says they ought to have struck
[37:22] stuck to good and
[37:24] life so it's a it's a unique way of
[37:27] separate you have the tree of life and
[37:29] you have good and evil so it's life and
[37:31] death good and evil he brings that kind
[37:33] of symmetry out he said they ought to
[37:34] have stuck to good and Life to
[37:37] experience opposites which means good
[37:39] and evil or life and death was not
[37:41] necessarily not necessary nor useful and
[37:44] so it was
[37:45] prohibited it's almost just going back
[37:47] to why would why would it be necessary
[37:51] for
[37:52] man uh to
[37:55] experience good and evil or life and
[37:57] death he says it's not it was not
[37:59] necessary for man therefore it was
[38:00] prohibited but we know it was
[38:03] necessary for the plan of
[38:06] God so there is this in comes the
[38:09] persuasion of Satan but because they
[38:11] were persuaded by Satan and led by their
[38:13] own
[38:14] curiosity they chose the latter
[38:16] Alternatives and they turned to the
[38:18] Forbidden tree of knowledge of Good and
[38:20] Evil this we recognize the woman first
[38:23] the man following in his Disobedience
[38:25] this first and Crest a became the root
[38:28] of all their following mistakes and
[38:30] perplexities I want you to notice that
[38:32] once they start out in this path of lust
[38:36] and once there is this frustration of
[38:38] thought this air in thinking it then
[38:40] becomes the the air in
[38:43] acting and then there's this wanting and
[38:46] This calamity uh that that follows forth
[38:49] from the act and from their thirst but
[38:51] he says notice how from the root of
[38:53] their mistake for soon they blushed when
[38:56] they realized they were
[38:58] naked they looked for coverings which
[39:01] would help not at all they fled from God
[39:05] the Fountain of all good things they
[39:07] contrived lies in the place of sincere
[39:10] humble confession of their he and so
[39:12] they slipped from one offense into
[39:14] another into what a cunningly made
[39:17] Labyrinth The Infernal datalist knew how
[39:20] to lead them we would say and to what a
[39:23] cunningly made Labyrinth the devil knew
[39:26] how to lead them
[39:28] that in making the mistake they weren't
[39:30] aware of oh my goodness we've sinned let
[39:32] us pursue after God so that we could
[39:34] atone and we could repent and we can be
[39:35] cleansed and purged but rather they hid
[39:37] from him tried to cover themselves in
[39:39] religion uh thinking they could hide
[39:42] from God than lie to God and he says
[39:44] look at how they fallen into the
[39:47] Labyrinth and what is it in The
[39:49] Labyrinth in the story of the Greek
[39:52] mythology the this the the the fit of
[39:54] lust it brought forth a monster
[39:58] the man and the woman being the
[40:01] Divine a and the serpent being from the
[40:03] earth and Satan with his powers uh the
[40:06] deformer you had a mix now through this
[40:09] the it brings forth a monster we could
[40:11] say Cain we could say the the the
[40:15] minitar if you want to look at in the
[40:16] mythology but it was a mix of that which
[40:17] is beautiful and Heavenly the man the
[40:19] Divine and the satanic which is
[40:23] deformed and it is the woman who is
[40:25] enticed to be like
[40:28] God and the woman is said God do know
[40:31] that the day that you eat thereof you
[40:32] shall become as Gods possessing a
[40:35] greater knowledge a greater conscience a
[40:37] greater awareness so there was this
[40:39] enticement that she would become as God
[40:41] but in trying to become like God with a
[40:43] greater conscience and even God saying
[40:45] now look they've become like one of us
[40:47] to know good and evil now they are like
[40:50] God with this greater conscience but
[40:51] they become like Satan in disobeying
[40:54] God so now even in the act that produces
[40:58] the one it's joined with the other to
[41:00] where you have the mixing of the Divine
[41:02] and the
[41:04] satanic thus God at this Unholy Union
[41:08] and this mongering however you want to
[41:10] put it this hting God allowed the world
[41:13] that he made for Mankind's enjoyment
[41:16] that he made by his spoken word that the
[41:18] Bible said was made by his wisdom God
[41:23] allowed that world to become a
[41:26] labyrinth and now this world I believe
[41:28] brother brandham is telling us in the
[41:30] church age book through a number of
[41:31] different statements but then also as
[41:34] commenius says it's full of air
[41:36] exhaustion and
[41:41] delusion in Proverbs chapter 21 verse 16
[41:43] it says the man that Werth out of the
[41:45] way of understanding shall remain in the
[41:48] congregation of the
[41:50] Dead that wandering that lack of
[41:53] understanding that frustration of
[41:54] thought which leads the ER in acting and
[41:57] the the air of
[41:58] wanting the man that Werth out of the
[42:00] way of understanding that's why
[42:02] understanding and wisdom is the answer
[42:04] not of this world not of fables and
[42:06] theologies but the understanding of God
[42:08] the understanding of the wisdom of God
[42:11] and the plan of God the Plan of
[42:12] Redemption uh the purpose of God the
[42:15] life of
[42:16] God a man that wanders out of the way of
[42:18] understanding will remain in the
[42:19] congregation of the Dead unless God
[42:21] would rescue us and give us that quarter
[42:24] that line to to rescue us from the
[42:26] Labyrinth we're all remaining in the
[42:28] Labyrinth of dead to either be consumed
[42:30] by the Minotaur or to die of
[42:34] hunger man WTH out of the way of
[42:37] understanding in The
[42:40] Labyrinth commenius writes all are sent
[42:43] into it and all wonder about it Without
[42:46] End as the witness of Solomon and all
[42:49] wise men and sad and continuous
[42:51] experience itself are agreed upon that's
[42:53] your part Solomon concludes it all wise
[42:56] men and then the sad and continuous
[42:58] experience itself our own experiences
[43:01] can agree that man are sent into the
[43:03] Labyrinth of Life Born into this
[43:05] world of chaos and sin for the whole
[43:08] world is a great Labyrinth this is where
[43:10] brother bram's drawing where he says he
[43:12] compares the world to a labyrinth for
[43:15] the whole world is a great Labyrinth
[43:16] with innumerable lesser ones enclosed
[43:19] puzzle within a
[43:21] puzzle you know some I I I I like those
[43:24] mind puzzle you have to figure out how
[43:26] to get it off and and then the real hard
[43:27] part is how to get it back on it's like
[43:30] the and these things that open up in
[43:31] Puzzles and the different layers he's
[43:32] saying it's the world is a labyrinth and
[43:34] then there's an
[43:37] immeasurable uh uh Labyrinth enclosed in
[43:40] the world so that there is no one who
[43:43] does not wonder about some
[43:45] Labyrinth and some wonder about
[43:48] many if we could look at the minds of
[43:50] all men now instead of transporting
[43:52] ourselves to 1668 and trying to figure
[43:54] out you know as they chewed on their
[43:56] straw and Whitted or whatever uh what
[43:59] their labyrinths must have been but
[44:00] think of today just how much more
[44:03] pronounced I mean don't we feel like
[44:05] we're in labyrinths at times within a
[44:07] labyrinth
[44:09] right I mean just it's just over and
[44:11] over and over again it's like maze after
[44:13] Maze and you get out of one I'm in
[44:16] another one you get to the center of one
[44:18] you find there's another one that opens
[44:20] up if we could look at the minds of all
[44:22] men we would see entangled thoughts
[44:24] fantastic wonderings and great circling
[44:26] about
[44:28] then he just takes a very simple thing
[44:29] take the languages of mankind and you'll
[44:31] find an infinite chaos of extremely
[44:33] confusing sounds and
[44:36] Concepts as he writes this in a language
[44:38] that's no longer used except in Mass I
[44:42] guess or for the academics he says the
[44:44] language of man infinite numbers of
[44:46] chaos extremely confusing sounds and
[44:48] Concepts take the labors with which all
[44:50] under the sun occupy themselves and
[44:53] likewise you find innumerable
[44:54] perplexities either of circles or of a
[44:57] dead in passageways going up and down
[44:59] back and forth forth right and
[45:01] left if Solomon wisest of men the
[45:05] richest man in his kingdom still found
[45:07] his occupations a labyrinth for he often
[45:10] confessed this and complained grievously
[45:12] and his offspring experienced it worse
[45:14] what kind king or Prince or Noble even
[45:17] what private citizen dare promise
[45:19] himself immunity from Eternal wanderings
[45:22] and
[45:23] troubles if Solomon himself the one
[45:26] that's ued with all wisdom and all
[45:27] wealth and all opportunity would
[45:29] complain that in all his occupations and
[45:31] busyness in thoughts a and thinkings and
[45:35] acting and enjoyments that he would
[45:36] conclude that all is
[45:38] elaborate that grieved him and even his
[45:41] offspring experienced it worse how can
[45:44] we whether we be king Noble we as
[45:46] private citizens think dare think that
[45:49] we are immune from these wanderings and
[45:53] troubles he then says this and I'm
[45:55] breaking this up a little bit says but
[45:57] to return to the toils of the present
[45:59] life if we could think of the time we're
[46:01] living in now in this Leo Dean age I say
[46:03] that if anyone has a desire to Go
[46:05] Through the Ages Sexes ranks and Orders
[46:07] of mankind he will find nothing but
[46:10] labyrinths and rocks and Perpetual
[46:12] frustrations of desires there's your the
[46:16] Labyrinth syphus and Tantalus even in
[46:19] those things no matter what age you are
[46:23] what gender you are what rank you are
[46:26] what order you're from you'll find
[46:27] nothing but labyrinths in rocks and
[46:29] Perpetual frustrations of
[46:32] desires he says for the Youth have
[46:34] labyrinths labyrinths the agent have
[46:37] theirs nor do men or nor women lack
[46:41] theirs Farmers Artisans Merchants
[46:43] soldiers have their troubles and who
[46:45] doesn't in all of
[46:48] life it was this part to me that just
[46:50] really struck deep philosophers and
[46:51] others given to the study of wisdom seek
[46:54] antidotes against the Hees of the mind
[46:56] and against a life of trouble but how
[46:59] much they have found in part their own
[47:01] complaints and in part their Perpetual
[47:03] quars quarrels known to the world bear
[47:07] witness that even those who we would say
[47:10] they were the ones to sit down and
[47:11] figure it out for
[47:13] us they're the ones that contemplated
[47:15] that asked the hard questions that
[47:17] wrestled with the meaning of life and in
[47:19] their philosophies and their
[47:21] philosophizing to think of the erors of
[47:23] the mind and to think of the life of
[47:25] troubles and how can we guard against it
[47:27] and how can we figure these things out
[47:29] they of themselves complain of their
[47:31] Perpetual quarrels their lack of
[47:33] agreements and all bear witness that
[47:35] even the smartest and the most
[47:38] intelligent and the most wise cannot
[47:40] figure this life
[47:41] out it is absolutely amazing in the
[47:44] field of Behavioral economics wherein
[47:46] they've studied that there's certain
[47:47] Tendencies and there's ways to do this
[47:49] and there's cheating and there's
[47:50] dishonesty and and one would be caused
[47:52] to do these different things and given
[47:54] these different opportunities and they
[47:56] would say that even even when you're
[47:57] warned ahead of time that you're going
[47:59] to do it you can't keep yourself from
[48:01] doing it cuz it's so ingrained in
[48:04] humanity and then the part that is just
[48:06] kind of like I don't know if it's meta
[48:08] or what it would be but like the most
[48:10] tent of all of it is the very ones doing
[48:12] the study on
[48:14] dishonesty have been found to be
[48:17] dishonest that they faked the data that
[48:20] they did this and they did that and it's
[48:21] like well okay throw all the data out
[48:23] the window you are a perfect example of
[48:25] what you were trying to prove
[48:28] cuz no matter how much we can educate
[48:29] ourselves on human bias no matter how
[48:32] much we could study the Labyrinth to try
[48:35] to figure it out and make our way
[48:37] successful in this world and say oh I
[48:39] found this path or I know one that went
[48:41] this way the lath in itself is the
[48:44] congregation of the
[48:46] Dead the only way that we can live is to
[48:50] leave what is needless and choose
[48:54] Christ and Paul says I fear lest by any
[48:58] means as a serpent beguiled e through
[48:59] his subtlety so your mind should be
[49:01] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[49:05] Christ just
[49:07] think of just how many more Paul says
[49:11] the Simplicity that is in Christ and the
[49:13] beguiling of Eve and then when we read
[49:14] it we could just turn it into a nice
[49:16] little allegory and a cute little story
[49:18] and as they've watered it down today
[49:20] that the woman was just happily going
[49:22] through the garden a and a beautiful
[49:24] snake said would you like an apple and
[49:26] she's like whoa that's a beautiful Apple
[49:29] yes I would like that apple and that she
[49:32] eats this apple and God's
[49:34] like shame on you for eating the fruit
[49:38] cursed be
[49:39] everything the serpent the Earth you are
[49:43] going to be cursed a childbearing and
[49:45] I'm going to turn the world in laborate
[49:46] because you you ate an apricot or you
[49:48] ate an apple and and it just makes a
[49:51] nice story to where it's uh
[49:56] you know it's written in children's
[49:58] books and portrayed in such a way to
[49:59] where you could tell that story there's
[50:01] no harm in
[50:02] it but even in looking at it in that
[50:05] symbol the symbolisms of the
[50:08] act and even if we wanted to then begin
[50:11] to not take the entire Fable or
[50:14] mythology and I'm certainly not trying
[50:15] to try to type it all out well then
[50:17] thesis is this and then there's this it
[50:19] just never ends the mythology part that
[50:23] in this Labyrinth concept that brother
[50:24] bandam identifies and even what gave
[50:27] your eyes to the labyrith when we go
[50:28] back to this fit of lust and this
[50:31] committing of adultery we could see that
[50:32] well in the beginning they were not to
[50:34] mix they were not to do this and they
[50:36] were to do this there's a commandment
[50:37] and the prohibition but now think of
[50:39] where things are
[50:41] today what opportunities to sin did the
[50:45] man and the woman find themselves in in
[50:47] their day-to-day lives there between
[50:49] Genesis 2 and Genesis 3 and then think
[50:51] today and the enormity and the
[50:52] multiplicity and as the innumerable
[50:55] distractions and temptations that we
[50:57] face every day versus her Temptation
[51:00] that singular
[51:02] one comenius writes it this way who can
[51:05] number the labyrinths labyrinths of
[51:07] astronomy geography history and all the
[51:10] students are saying
[51:12] yep chronology medicine chemistry
[51:15] Alchemy think of all the things he's
[51:17] talking about these are all labyrinths
[51:19] if you've committed yourself to one of
[51:21] these already you've come upon
[51:23] insoluable
[51:25] mazes none of them have all the answers
[51:28] none of them could put their finger on
[51:30] it and conclude uh uh put a period and
[51:32] say this is
[51:33] it then he then he really this makes so
[51:37] much sense is in our present time
[51:39] Prudence in ruling human societies is
[51:41] called politics and its advisor is
[51:44] jurist Prudence we laugh we laugh
[51:47] hearing it but this is at the time this
[51:49] was the great rescuer of society this is
[51:52] what's going to hold Society together
[51:54] and make Men of Integrity is when you
[51:56] have politics and the Prudence in ruling
[51:58] human societies as they we coales to try
[52:01] to find Common Ground they use politics
[52:03] and jurist Prudence was to be its
[52:06] advisor the end of these is to keep
[52:08] human Affairs and the human race itself
[52:11] in order peace and in
[52:14] Tranquility that's the purpose of jurist
[52:16] prudence and
[52:18] politics in its beginning but this is
[52:20] how he observes it then but how they are
[52:22] kept all public squares courts and
[52:25] councils bear Witness for they are never
[52:27] peaceful but always bustling with
[52:29] quarrels and arguments but much more the
[52:31] Perpetual Wars between people and
[52:33] kingdoms Proclaim this with them the
[52:35] world is destroying itself in a terrible
[52:39] fashion politics isn't the rescue jurus
[52:42] Prudence isn't the rescue he's saying
[52:44] everything from astronomy geography
[52:46] history chronology medicine chemistry
[52:47] Alchemy politics jurus Prudence you name
[52:49] it any discipline of man is
[52:52] empty it is a labyrinth
[52:58] the
[53:00] temptation of the woman seem so
[53:02] straightforward do this don't do this
[53:05] the devil got her to do the what was
[53:08] prohibited now what do we face
[53:11] today the
[53:13] Labrinth Jesus finds himself in in the
[53:16] darkest time in human history at that
[53:18] time Bible says that man sat in
[53:22] darkness they were wandering astray out
[53:24] of the P way of understanding
[53:26] among the congregation of the dead and
[53:28] Christ comes as the Messiah once he's
[53:31] identified by that Dove and the witness
[53:33] from the father says in Matthew chapter
[53:35] 4 that he was led up of the spirit Into
[53:36] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[53:38] devil and here we find this parallel to
[53:42] the temptation of the woman and the
[53:44] tempter came to
[53:45] him and said if thou be the Son of God
[53:48] command that these Stones be made
[53:51] bread now brother BR this is what he
[53:53] takes in the Harvest time and it seems
[53:56] to me that everything turns on
[53:59] this command that these Stones be made
[54:01] bread he was hungry his body needed
[54:05] food if man does not eat he
[54:09] dies surely it was
[54:12] necessary surely it was
[54:16] needful but he answered and said it is
[54:20] written man shall not live by bread
[54:23] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[54:26] out of the mouth of
[54:29] God I I I would rather starve to
[54:33] death if eating would mean
[54:38] disobeying because for me to combine
[54:40] life with disobedience is exactly what
[54:43] happened in the beginning for me to try
[54:45] to trade or transact or figure out a way
[54:48] to sustain and keep things going or or
[54:50] to be successful but yet to do it in
[54:52] becoming disobedient to Satan it
[54:54] produces the Labyrinth
[54:57] that I was not meant to walk in that I
[54:59] was not meant to live in he says man
[55:02] shall not live by bread alone this to me
[55:04] becomes the foundation of the Escape it
[55:06] becomes the first strand of navigating
[55:08] out of the labyrinth but by every word
[55:10] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[55:12] I must find that cord I must find that
[55:16] path I must find every word of God and
[55:20] last I think that I'm standing there
[55:22] trying to observe the whole universe a
[55:24] and string it all together to make sense
[55:26] of it I must find it as a light into my
[55:29] feet a light into my path in the moment
[55:32] that I'm living at that very time the
[55:34] woman had all the understanding that she
[55:37] needed to say no to the devil but she
[55:40] stepped into darkness beyond the path
[55:42] that God had given her and she wandered
[55:44] out of the way of understanding to
[55:46] become the first of the congregation of
[55:48] the
[55:48] dead and here now Christ is being
[55:51] tempted with all these things that exist
[55:54] in all the world this Labyrinth of
[55:55] humanity
[55:57] command these Stones be made bread if
[55:59] thou be the Son of God no man shall not
[56:02] live by bread
[56:03] alone bread alone is not living but true
[56:06] life is to live by every word that
[56:09] proceedeth out of the mouth of
[56:11] God and Jesus's Temptation doesn't end
[56:15] there he faces seemingly three different
[56:18] Temptations He faces the temptation of
[56:20] all that is in the world the lust of the
[56:22] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[56:23] of
[56:24] life the woman has singular conversation
[56:28] and this singular temptation as it's
[56:30] recited us and she gives in and the sin
[56:33] uh uh she brings forth that that that
[56:36] that human and beast combined together
[56:39] and the Labyrinth that man is Born Into
[56:42] th this is that uh unfolding of chaos
[56:45] from the
[56:46] beginning and then when Jesus comes when
[56:49] he says no to the devil there's another
[56:52] Temptation he says no there's another
[56:55] temptation now we Face the same thing
[57:01] today if this is he if it's if it's too
[57:05] much I know that even people that love
[57:07] me I'm very very faithful I I I just say
[57:11] this with love in my heart to say
[57:13] brother Aaron they told me brother Aaron
[57:14] your ministry is not really for me but
[57:17] they love me and they're faithful
[57:19] because maybe I speak in sometimes in
[57:21] ways and of different things that they
[57:24] might just not think like why couldn't
[57:25] you just
[57:26] do this a different way and I realize
[57:30] and my response was well if I thought my
[57:32] Ministry was for everybody I'd be
[57:34] depressed because just look at the size
[57:36] of the church it's there's not you know
[57:38] Six Trillion people in it you know
[57:40] something's
[57:41] wrong uh but I know my Ministry is not
[57:44] for everybody I know that there may be
[57:45] some tonight that might be wrestling
[57:47] with these things that I'm sharing and
[57:48] you have every right every right to do
[57:50] so and I would hope that you you just
[57:53] find your peace with God and follow the
[57:54] holy spirit that you have in your life
[57:55] but I believe that God is wanting to
[57:58] express something to us tonight in a way
[58:00] to get our attention how that our
[58:01] personal lives our homes and our
[58:03] churches and all this world have become
[58:05] these innumerable
[58:10] labyrinths that never bring the
[58:12] satisfaction and quietness that we truly
[58:16] want who can number all these labyrinths
[58:19] in
[58:21] life and then listen to this I believe I
[58:23] might have provided this for Satan has a
[58:25] sophist brother Brandon quote you'll
[58:27] find this in the church age book he
[58:28] speaks of Satan being a sophist for
[58:30] Satan as a sophist never gives in to
[58:34] arguing you catch
[58:36] that he's never going to give in AR if
[58:38] you argue with the Devil he's kind of
[58:40] like keep yes I've got what I wanted as
[58:44] long as you argue with him it gives him
[58:46] life it fuels him he figures as long as
[58:48] you're willing to engage with me and
[58:50] rationalize and argue and try to do the
[58:52] Apologetics or whatever he's like I'm
[58:54] not going to get tired of this I promise
[58:57] you then he says but we unfortunate
[59:00] recruits the sons of Eve just like our
[59:02] mother one after the other are LED
[59:06] little by little from what is better and
[59:08] what is
[59:09] true we fall somehow all the way to
[59:11] Universal apostasy from the Faith Life
[59:15] and hope of
[59:18] Christ we the unfortunate
[59:22] recruits the sons of Eve just like our
[59:26] mother are LED little by little away
[59:29] from what is best away from what is true
[59:31] away from what is Faith Life and Truth
[59:33] hope the way the hope of Christ
[59:36] seemingly to Universal
[59:43] apostasy there's some weight to that
[59:46] brother bman the sermon Harvest Time
[59:48] says it this way and I'll go back in
[59:50] Genesis which is the beginning Genesis
[59:52] means the beginning we find that God
[59:55] gave his family eternal life as long as
[59:57] they stayed in his word and lived by his
[1:00:00] word but when they broke it just one
[1:00:02] Link in the chain of promises death
[1:00:04] struck them which was a promise also
[1:00:06] it's a chain you are hanging over hell
[1:00:09] with it and that's the only thing
[1:00:10] that'll carry you through when the
[1:00:13] believer becomes a makeb Believer and
[1:00:14] lives on one word that's contrary to
[1:00:16] this word he cuts his fellowship with
[1:00:18] God one link broke and remember your
[1:00:22] faith in this word is like a chain a
[1:00:24] chain is its strongest its weakest
[1:00:28] link that's right it's the
[1:00:31] strongest that's cuz that's all it'll
[1:00:34] hold and if there's something in the
[1:00:36] word that's puzzling to you something
[1:00:38] that you've heard different but they
[1:00:39] said thee oh that was for the apostles
[1:00:42] in them things was for days gone by when
[1:00:45] the scripture said Jesus Christ is the
[1:00:47] same yesterday today and forever don't
[1:00:49] let that be a
[1:00:51] weakness fortify it and hold it and wrap
[1:00:54] your life into it because that's the
[1:00:56] only thing that'll take you over the
[1:00:58] Flames of
[1:00:59] Hell the subtlety of Satan to try to
[1:01:02] convince us that there's certain things
[1:01:04] that were for days gone by and they're
[1:01:06] no longer in the word of God or to get
[1:01:08] us to uh to become formal or to get us
[1:01:10] to become charismatic oh how the devil
[1:01:12] would love for us to leave the
[1:01:14] protection of the word of God he said if
[1:01:17] there's something might seem to be a
[1:01:18] weakness to thee something that's seems
[1:01:21] a little different don't let it be a
[1:01:23] weakness fortified hold it strengthen it
[1:01:26] when this chain is
[1:01:27] broke with Adam and Eve the first family
[1:01:30] remember they didn't break a sentence
[1:01:31] they didn't break three words one
[1:01:35] word it's kind of what brought me back
[1:01:37] to this is how that the woman broke one
[1:01:40] word Jesus is tempted from all these
[1:01:42] different angles and then we get here in
[1:01:43] this day and we're like What hopefully
[1:01:46] Sunday we can get into more how that
[1:01:48] Christendom is what brother bam
[1:01:50] identifies it's religion it's
[1:01:52] Christianity that's become the worst
[1:01:53] Labyrinth of them all amen
[1:01:59] not just a sentence not three words one
[1:02:02] word man shall hang over Hell by every
[1:02:05] word every word that proceeded out of
[1:02:07] the mouth of God that's where man's
[1:02:09] Eternal destination is determined why
[1:02:11] he'll hang by that chain or he'll hang
[1:02:14] by a Creed or if there's a Creed mixed
[1:02:16] into the chain there is where the weak
[1:02:18] link is and you're
[1:02:20] gone there's where the weak link was
[1:02:23] with Adam and with the Eve that we link
[1:02:26] surely he said God but surely God said
[1:02:30] it and if God said it God meant it and
[1:02:33] he also keeps his word by saying the day
[1:02:35] you eat thereof that day you
[1:02:38] die the day you put into you anything
[1:02:41] else besides the unadulterated word of
[1:02:44] God in your soul that's the day that
[1:02:46] you're separated from God said now this
[1:02:49] is very strong but just listen close
[1:02:51] notice one word one word of the first of
[1:02:53] the Bible God said one word separ
[1:02:55] separated man from its eternal life
[1:03:00] chain it's where we are
[1:03:03] today now I I know that that might not
[1:03:06] uh ring true of bringing to light and
[1:03:09] better understanding the evils of our
[1:03:10] time so that we can swiftly apply the
[1:03:12] remedies you look out to the Myriad of
[1:03:14] possibilities that we could leave
[1:03:15] tonight in sin or disobey or offend or
[1:03:17] transgress in all the different ways
[1:03:19] that we might find our mind being
[1:03:21] tempted to erors of thinking and how
[1:03:22] that we might find ourselves in errors
[1:03:24] of acting and how that even after the
[1:03:26] fact we have the frustration of
[1:03:27] enjoyment man there's a million things
[1:03:30] it would
[1:03:33] seem but yet
[1:03:35] somehow it all comes back to every
[1:03:41] word I'll share this in closing in Amos
[1:03:43] chapter 8: 11-13 I'll read it I might
[1:03:47] not spend much time on it but you're
[1:03:48] familiar with it behold the days come
[1:03:50] sayi the Lord God that I will send a
[1:03:51] famine in the land not a famine of bread
[1:03:55] Jesus in Matthew chapter 4 it could be
[1:03:57] said that there was no bread therefore
[1:03:58] he needed to come up with some means to
[1:04:00] create bread there was a an absence of
[1:04:03] bread to sustain life but here it says
[1:04:05] there will be a famine in the land not
[1:04:06] of bread nor a thirst for water so
[1:04:08] there'll be hungering and thirsting but
[1:04:10] not for bread and water but of hearing
[1:04:12] the words of the
[1:04:14] Lord and in that time of the Famine of
[1:04:17] bread and the Famine of water which is
[1:04:20] speaking of the hearing of the words of
[1:04:22] the Lord they shall Wander from sea to
[1:04:24] Sea and from North even to the East and
[1:04:27] they shall run to and fro to seek the
[1:04:29] word of the Lord and shall not find it
[1:04:31] they will be in their
[1:04:33] labyrinths thinking that at the end of
[1:04:35] the day they'll find Christ at the
[1:04:37] center only to come in contact with a
[1:04:40] Minotaur who eats their
[1:04:43] flesh in that day shall their Fair
[1:04:45] virgins and young men faint for thirst
[1:04:49] those who are familiar with the Delights
[1:04:50] of Tantalus will find that he was
[1:04:52] condemned to Eternal hunger and thirst
[1:04:55] the frustra of Desire never able to
[1:04:57] quench never able to
[1:05:00] satisfy and here you see the very image
[1:05:02] in scripture not a famine for bread not
[1:05:06] a famine for
[1:05:08] water but a hunger and thirst for the
[1:05:10] word of God and they wer from sea to Sea
[1:05:13] north to East to and fro to me it's even
[1:05:16] in the reading from North even to the
[1:05:19] east is that that manner in wondering is
[1:05:23] without aim without Direction not sure
[1:05:25] which way to go to seek the word Lord
[1:05:27] but they're never able to find
[1:05:30] it comenius writes woe to him who has
[1:05:32] not extricated himself from the world's
[1:05:34] labyrinths before the end of
[1:05:37] life woe to him who in death does not
[1:05:40] know how to place aside his bundle of
[1:05:42] sins woe to him who after death senses
[1:05:45] that he's been born into the company of
[1:05:47] Tantalus that Eternal
[1:05:50] damnation that fire that is never
[1:05:53] quenched that that that Darkness and
[1:05:55] that Blackness of soul and that
[1:05:57] existence in the Life Beyond without the
[1:06:00] grace of God to carry you into
[1:06:02] Paradise woe to him who does not know
[1:06:05] how to get out of the world's
[1:06:07] labyrinths so brother brandham says
[1:06:10] quoting from commenius it's in the
[1:06:11] church book with the Bible in our hand
[1:06:13] we should
[1:06:14] cry if you brought your Bible you don't
[1:06:16] need to grab your iPhones or your
[1:06:18] blackberries but with your Bible in your
[1:06:20] hand we should
[1:06:22] cry I believe what God has revealed in
[1:06:24] this book
[1:06:26] I will obediently keep his commands I
[1:06:29] will hope for that which he has
[1:06:32] promised this is in this Unum
[1:06:35] necessarium this is in this one thing
[1:06:36] necessary brother says one thing needful
[1:06:39] I will believe the words that are
[1:06:41] revealed in this book I will keep his
[1:06:43] commands I will be obedient I will hope
[1:06:45] for that which he
[1:06:47] promised and he says Christians give
[1:06:51] ear there is only one life but death
[1:06:54] comes to us in a thousand
[1:06:57] forms there's only one Christ but a
[1:06:59] thousand
[1:07:03] Antichrist only one thing is
[1:07:07] needful I'm so
[1:07:11] glad that brother
[1:07:14] brandham didn't use the example of
[1:07:18] link and the tears of the
[1:07:21] Kingdom with the endless
[1:07:24] bosses and ESS
[1:07:26] mazes and all the things that we have to
[1:07:29] navigate in order to get to the end and
[1:07:32] save the Princess
[1:07:37] Zelda our mindset is this uh Next Level
[1:07:41] mindset right beat the boss and finally
[1:07:44] beat the final boss and you know what
[1:07:45] they do today the final boss was the
[1:07:48] final boss before the final boss and
[1:07:50] then oh guess what there's a prequel you
[1:07:52] got to go back and beat the pre-boss
[1:07:54] right and then you to come back and beat
[1:07:56] the boss that was actually behind the
[1:07:57] final boss then you find out you
[1:07:59] actually didn't kill the final boss
[1:08:02] right then as it Go unfolds you find out
[1:08:05] you are the boss you're the evil one and
[1:08:09] now all the guys you beat before trying
[1:08:10] to kill
[1:08:12] you that's the Labyrinth we're all
[1:08:15] living in and the the the solution isn't
[1:08:18] well you got to kill this Antichrist you
[1:08:20] got to kill this Antichrist you got to
[1:08:21] figure this out this lust out you got to
[1:08:23] kill this you got to find this sacred
[1:08:24] thing you got to be able to do this and
[1:08:26] we're all jumping around trying to uh
[1:08:27] bump into question marks and find magic
[1:08:29] mushrooms and all sorts of Secrets and
[1:08:32] cheat codes to get out and the word of
[1:08:34] God says no no no no no no no there are
[1:08:36] thousands of antichrist but All You Need
[1:08:38] Is Christ to defeat
[1:08:40] them there are thousands of ways to
[1:08:43] death but only one to life you don't
[1:08:45] have to defeat death in a thousand forms
[1:08:47] you just have to submit to life in its
[1:08:50] singular form the
[1:08:52] word Brothers if you'd come to your
[1:08:54] instruments Christians of ear there's
[1:08:55] only one life but death comes to us in a
[1:08:57] thousand
[1:08:59] forms there's only one Christ but a
[1:09:01] thousand Antichrist comia said it this
[1:09:04] way life is onefold and
[1:09:06] simple but there are a thousand forms of
[1:09:09] dying that
[1:09:12] remarkable life is onefold and simple
[1:09:14] but there are thousand forms of dying
[1:09:16] truth is onefold and simple but there
[1:09:19] are thousand forms of
[1:09:21] airing likewise Christ is onefold
[1:09:26] and
[1:09:26] simple but there are a thousand forms of
[1:09:34] antichrist I tell you I know why Paul
[1:09:37] said I
[1:09:39] fear lest by any
[1:09:42] means by any
[1:09:45] means Satan would beguile the body of
[1:09:50] Christ into bearing
[1:09:53] with any form of the anti an
[1:09:56] Christ when Christ is onefold and
[1:10:00] simple I say well we got to figure this
[1:10:04] out right let's get together and let's
[1:10:08] figure this
[1:10:10] out so that we can come up with a way
[1:10:12] out of this
[1:10:14] Labyrinth and then once we figured it
[1:10:16] out let's kind of protect this
[1:10:19] truth so that we can make it out and
[1:10:23] then we become elaborate to
[1:10:27] ourselves when truly the answer and I'm
[1:10:30] at peace with saying this is that you
[1:10:33] would come to know Christ
[1:10:36] personally truly know Christ
[1:10:40] personally that's your only way out of
[1:10:42] your personal Labyrinth the Labyrinth of
[1:10:45] family history The Labyrinth that this
[1:10:47] message has become and the Labyrinth
[1:10:50] that Christianity has become and the
[1:10:52] Labyrinth that this world has become
[1:10:54] whether you want to observe one as
[1:10:55] within the other everything pointing to
[1:10:57] each other the only way out is through
[1:10:58] Christ and Christ
[1:11:01] Alone the only place I could find where
[1:11:03] brother brandom talks about am maaz is
[1:11:04] when he speak he sings the song My Faith
[1:11:07] looks up to thee while life's dark maze
[1:11:12] I
[1:11:14] tread that even the songwriter
[1:11:18] recognized this Myriad of options and
[1:11:21] choices and that life itself was called
[1:11:23] a dark maze life the world christom all
[1:11:26] of it's become elaborate what is our way
[1:11:28] out Christ Christ is our way out what
[1:11:31] does the message reveal Christ it
[1:11:34] doesn't reveal brother brandom it
[1:11:35] doesn't reveal cultist behaviors and
[1:11:37] ideas it it doesn't it doesn't it's not
[1:11:40] it's not leading us into anything other
[1:11:42] than Christ if it doesn't it's not the
[1:11:47] message if it does it's the thing that
[1:11:49] we were warned against and you've made
[1:11:52] it into something that it's not
[1:11:55] life is onefold and simple thus Christ
[1:11:57] is onefold and
[1:11:58] simple the
[1:12:04] Labyrinth We're In
[1:12:07] It Can you feel
[1:12:09] it you feel the
[1:12:12] Labrinth we're trying to come up with
[1:12:14] all sorts of ways we'll just let
[1:12:17] AI get us out of
[1:12:20] it that may be the ultimate Labyrinth
[1:12:23] that's the final boss
[1:12:26] is as it has learned from all Humanity
[1:12:29] from all the all of humanity is now it
[1:12:32] is learning from
[1:12:34] it in order to move you
[1:12:37] along
[1:12:39] now as children of Eve by little and
[1:12:43] little away from what is
[1:12:45] better and away from what is
[1:12:49] true God help us thank you for your
[1:12:51] patience
[1:12:52] tonight I know this was a difficult
[1:12:55] subject to cover I welcome you to be
[1:12:57] honest in your feedback it won't scare
[1:13:00] me or at least I in saying that I'm Not
[1:13:02] Afraid afterwards I may be
[1:13:05] trembling but I share this with a loving
[1:13:08] heart believing that it's needful having
[1:13:10] peace perfect peace to deliver it
[1:13:12] knowing that God is watching out over
[1:13:14] your
[1:13:15] hearts to protect you and to keep you
[1:13:19] could we pray together if you could
[1:13:21] stand to your
[1:13:22] feet let's just bow our heads
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:39] if we could with our heads
[1:13:42] bowed
[1:13:45] I I I think there's a beautiful picture
[1:13:48] that's painted in the Unum
[1:13:51] necessarium of commenius and
[1:13:55] what he's looking at he even wrote it
[1:13:57] earlier in the labyrinth in the paradise
[1:13:59] of the heart the Labyrinth of the world
[1:14:01] and the paradise of the heart wrote that
[1:14:02] in the check language in 1631 in there
[1:14:05] somewhere 1633 he takes that principle
[1:14:09] and that allegory and he uses it in Unum
[1:14:11] necessarium and that's the part that
[1:14:12] brother bram's quoting from in this
[1:14:14] later work after he's learned a lot
[1:14:17] after he's come to realize that even
[1:14:18] himself was caught up in The Labyrinth
[1:14:21] such an engaging story to use these
[1:14:23] Greek mythologies
[1:14:26] and how that they're built upon these
[1:14:29] truths and that by the word of God we
[1:14:31] could
[1:14:34] identify the error of mankind the
[1:14:37] frustrations and
[1:14:39] errors and then to come back to our
[1:14:44] duty that God has given us a word for us
[1:14:47] to
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:50] contemplate and in contemplating it know
[1:14:53] to have the mind of Christ to know what
[1:14:56] he wants done with the
[1:14:59] word and in using it in a way that
[1:15:03] brings about good works and
[1:15:06] enjoyment and how practical it
[1:15:10] is listen I would love I would love uh
[1:15:13] to have you know just that turning in
[1:15:17] all of our Lives to where the power of
[1:15:19] the word of God in this last day is
[1:15:21] working so that we just we speak to the
[1:15:23] monsoons and we we cool off the
[1:15:26] temperatures and and we're able to get
[1:15:28] more rain than dust and we just we just
[1:15:31] kind of operate in this environment that
[1:15:32] whatever we want for dinner we can just
[1:15:34] create it we're just speaking in ways
[1:15:35] that are so so profound and so
[1:15:38] extraordinary and then brother brandham
[1:15:40] says well I mean if you're going to have
[1:15:41] to have faith to change your body and
[1:15:43] you don't even have faith for a
[1:15:44] toothache I think we got a little bit of
[1:15:46] ways to go
[1:15:47] here and we might look at that and think
[1:15:49] wow what a Chasm what a divide but
[1:15:51] really it's so so Quantum it's so small
[1:15:56] because it's so simple that if I could
[1:15:58] just begin to live by that simple Faith
[1:16:01] live by that simple faith and day by day
[1:16:04] walk in that Supreme faith and just walk
[1:16:07] in it every day and learning to overcome
[1:16:10] learning from my mistakes growing
[1:16:12] learning how uh make right my wrongs
[1:16:14] whatever it might be say Lord I don't
[1:16:16] want to try to change my body tonight I
[1:16:20] just want to live right until my head
[1:16:22] hits that pillow I want to do the right
[1:16:25] things before my wife and children in
[1:16:26] these moments that I have in the morning
[1:16:28] when I Rise I I want to honor you if I
[1:16:30] make mistakes I want to make them right
[1:16:32] I I I I don't want to try to make this
[1:16:34] so complicated to where I'm reaching out
[1:16:37] beyond what is
[1:16:39] possible because truly we live in a
[1:16:41] labyrinth and with man it is impossible
[1:16:43] With God all things are
[1:16:46] possible so I want to pray for you
[1:16:48] tonight say Lord help us help us in all
[1:16:51] these labyrinths
[1:16:55] how can I get back to
[1:16:57] Eden in Satan's Eden what does it mean
[1:16:59] to
[1:17:01] live under the Covenant of the Garden of
[1:17:04] Eden what does it mean to enjoy
[1:17:11] life what does it mean to be a
[1:17:14] Christian let's pray gracious Heavenly
[1:17:18] Father Lord I've gone long
[1:17:22] and I've read a lot from
[1:17:25] a work that was written in
[1:17:27] Latin hundreds of years
[1:17:33] ago but Lord I
[1:17:35] believe that your Prophet reached down
[1:17:38] into that perhaps to the aid and the
[1:17:41] understanding of Lil there was a a
[1:17:43] meeting of the minds and this
[1:17:45] discussions that they undertook and some
[1:17:47] may want to write it off as brother Veil
[1:17:50] and but Lord You've at least preserved
[1:17:53] it for us
[1:17:55] he didn't stay in a dumpster and wasn't
[1:17:58] so obscured and convoluted to where we
[1:17:59] don't have our copy brother bradam
[1:18:01] referred to it it's been published it's
[1:18:03] been preserved so it's at least been
[1:18:04] preserved for us to wrestle
[1:18:07] with for us to read and to make up our
[1:18:10] minds and Lord the prophet
[1:18:14] just updated it to that time and said
[1:18:17] commenius referred to this labyrinth in
[1:18:20] his day and then we look at the day
[1:18:22] we're living in now yes yes yes the
[1:18:25] world is a labyrinth and within the
[1:18:27] world Labyrinth are these religious
[1:18:31] labyrinths educational
[1:18:34] labyrinths oh
[1:18:36] my so
[1:18:43] many and your Prophet just brought it to
[1:18:45] this simple
[1:18:47] conclusion
[1:18:52] Christ Christ is the one thing thing
[1:18:55] that is
[1:18:56] necessary man shall not live by bread
[1:18:59] alone but by every word Lord I pray that
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:04] simple uh
[1:19:06] statement and that simple truth be
[1:19:09] become practical for us that there could
[1:19:12] be this rubber meets the road this
[1:19:15] guidance of footsteps in everyday living
[1:19:17] to realize there is a way to uh take
[1:19:21] that a and to process it to where it's
[1:19:23] applicable
[1:19:26] and how that Satan is offering us meat
[1:19:28] and that there's a Temptations and
[1:19:30] there's these quandaries and these these
[1:19:32] rules and all sorts of uh complications
[1:19:35] that try to entice
[1:19:37] us away from the one thing is NE that is
[1:19:43] necessary Lord I pray that you would
[1:19:46] help
[1:19:50] us help us in our daily living to I want
[1:19:53] to overcome Lord I say this personally I
[1:19:56] want to
[1:19:57] overcome I don't want to remain the same
[1:20:02] man God help me to become
[1:20:07] better to not little by little be led
[1:20:10] away from that which is better and
[1:20:13] true but Lord may I little by little
[1:20:16] walk in the way of understanding getting
[1:20:18] further away from the congregation of
[1:20:19] the Dead entering more deeply into life
[1:20:22] Lord may I do so as a father of a
[1:20:24] daughter may I do so as a father of sons
[1:20:26] may I do so as a husband to a wife a
[1:20:29] brother to sisters and brothers what may
[1:20:31] I
[1:20:32] find a path
[1:20:36] Lord in which I'm following that course
[1:20:39] that you have laid for me the one thing
[1:20:41] needful that is my escape from this Maze
[1:20:44] of life and this Labyrinth of
[1:20:47] death I want to achieve a closer walk
[1:20:50] with
[1:20:51] you I want to overcome Lord
[1:20:55] I want to do
[1:20:58] better Lord I want
[1:21:01] my my
[1:21:04] life inwardly in my thought life
[1:21:08] outwardly in my Act of life and then
[1:21:11] back inwardly in my enjoyment of life to
[1:21:13] not be
[1:21:15] frustrated bless us I pray I ask all
[1:21:18] this for myself Lord as I pour my heart
[1:21:20] out to you I pray for this congregation
