[0:00] as we're talking about the house of the
[0:01] Lord maybe the emphasis has been uh
[0:04] making our houses homes even in the last
[0:07] service is kind of what we were touching
[0:08] on is we can have different houses but
[0:10] they there's more to a house there's
[0:13] something about a house that makes it a
[0:15] home and just having an edifice or a bed
[0:17] or a place that you store your goods
[0:18] doesn't make a dwell in a home but
[0:20] brother bam talks about the order and
[0:22] the character is what makes a house a
[0:25] home and we drew a lot from Mark 3:25
[0:28] which says and if a house be divided
[0:31] against itself that house cannot stand
[0:34] and so we I think the title we were
[0:36] using A House Divided is no home so if
[0:38] there's any kind of division or disorder
[0:40] or chaos that's not the feelings you
[0:43] have of home and I know we could kind of
[0:46] make the argument that some of us have
[0:47] experienced things in life where we have
[0:49] a c particular definition of what family
[0:51] is or maybe chaos um maybe dysfunction
[0:54] is what describes your family or chaos
[0:57] describes your home and unless there's
[0:59] chaos that's not not home or unless
[1:00] there's not dysfunction that's not
[1:02] family that's not really what we're
[1:03] identifying we're identifying what home
[1:05] really should be and the order and the
[1:07] character uh that there ought to be and
[1:09] as we were looking at a house divided as
[1:11] no home we ended on the thought that we
[1:13] as men are called to be home builders
[1:16] ladies are called to be Homemakers and
[1:18] we each have a role in uh in making our
[1:21] hearts homes but we've been looking at
[1:23] the making our house where we dwell
[1:25] where we live where we bite our time
[1:26] turning it in uh to a place that also
[1:29] honors the Lord where the Lord is
[1:30] welcome brother BR makes that statement
[1:32] the Revival doesn't come by the preacher
[1:35] Revival didn't come because brother
[1:36] Jason was here Revival didn't come
[1:38] because of brother Andre or or brother
[1:40] Tim DOD Revival's not coming when
[1:41] brother Ed makes it but Revival comes by
[1:44] the people in their home life uh and so
[1:46] we have the power of Revival in the way
[1:49] that we keep our homes and the way that
[1:50] we live our daily lives and so tonight
[1:53] my title is as for me and my home and I
[1:56] think I might have actually truncated a
[1:57] little bit on the slide there and when I
[2:00] uh did the online but it's as for me and
[2:03] my home and I want to emphasize this our
[2:05] Christian Duty begins first at home uh
[2:08] we identify Christianity with church and
[2:10] there's a lot of things we identify the
[2:11] message with Ministry and preaching and
[2:13] a lot of things that relate to church
[2:15] service but I want us to recognize that
[2:17] our duty begins first at home and that's
[2:20] where we really want to focus our
[2:22] efforts in growing as a Christian is not
[2:24] so much in how we worship here but how
[2:26] we worship God outside now if you could
[2:29] look at mark 3:
[2:31] 27 this is where I want to start tonight
[2:34] and just appreciate your attentiveness
[2:35] and you're pulling on the word already
[2:38] but it says in verse 27 this is we're
[2:41] looking at a house divided cannot stand
[2:44] but it says no man can enter into a
[2:46] strong man's house and spoil his Goods
[2:49] except he will first bind the strong man
[2:51] and then he will spoil his house this is
[2:54] Jesus teaching them that I am not part
[2:56] of Satan's house I'm not be elub because
[2:58] I'm not casting out demons um as the
[3:01] head of the house against myself but
[3:03] rather I've entered into Satan's kingdom
[3:05] and I have bound his power therefore I'm
[3:07] able to spoil his house and spoil his
[3:10] power over these humans to cast out
[3:12] these demons and so we could kind of
[3:15] back up and identify that if you can
[3:18] bind what gives power to the house bind
[3:21] the one that watches out over the house
[3:23] bind the one that sets the order bind
[3:25] the one who's the strongest in the house
[3:27] Jesus is saying then you can divide it
[3:29] uh the house wasn't divided against
[3:31] itself on its own rather but Christ had
[3:34] stepped into it caused the division and
[3:36] therefore he could cast these demons out
[3:38] so we could take away from that that if
[3:40] you can bind the strong man of the house
[3:42] you can ruin the house in that phrase
[3:45] bind the strong man I just want to point
[3:47] to this very quickly uh that that man of
[3:50] strength in any house ought to be the
[3:52] husband we know there may be some
[3:54] situations where there is no husband uh
[3:56] perhaps even if you're living on your
[3:57] own you wouldn't necessarily have that
[3:59] marital relationship to identify this
[4:01] and so maybe we'll bring more into this
[4:03] later but if you were to look at that to
[4:06] bind the strong man in a dwelling in a
[4:08] household the husband the father would
[4:10] be that strong man and so it would to
[4:12] bind the strong would to be bind the
[4:15] husband bind the master or the head of
[4:18] the house and that's what that hus would
[4:20] be and husband so you you you bind the
[4:23] the the strong man I'm thinking about
[4:25] this idea of binding that man the man of
[4:27] the house if you can get him to
[4:28] compromise if you could break fatherhood
[4:30] if you could break motherhood if you
[4:31] could break that backbone of the family
[4:33] then the Nations broke is what brother
[4:35] bam taught us and even in that word
[4:38] husband there's a lot of a lot of ways
[4:39] that we could look at this but that
[4:41] husband was one who was the head of that
[4:43] dwelling the head of a house but the the
[4:45] band in that comes from the word bond
[4:48] meaning to to become or to grow and even
[4:51] the term is it would be used in the Old
[4:53] English it would speak of one who is
[4:55] Bond even the scripture speaks of bond
[4:57] or free that Bond would be one who is
[4:59] under a Lord to give service to that
[5:01] Lord so the husband in a house would be
[5:04] the one who's the head of that dwelling
[5:06] and maybe he's bond to someone greater
[5:09] than him but that's his household he's
[5:11] the husband of that home but he has one
[5:14] greater he's bound to service or has a
[5:16] loyalty uh above himself and I think
[5:18] it's really good to think of ourselves
[5:20] that way that while we uh may have
[5:22] things that we own and things we possess
[5:24] we owe a greater loyalty to the Lord
[5:27] that the head of man is Christ and that
[5:29] he is we're bound to him and we serve
[5:31] him so a husband ought to have loyalty
[5:33] to Christ loyalty to the word and then
[5:37] to bind the strong man even in the
[5:39] language it was just really striking me
[5:41] more and more that the husband is bound
[5:43] to Christ we ought to be bound the
[5:46] strong man of the house is bound to a
[5:48] greater power in the right order but to
[5:50] bind the strong man is to bring him
[5:52] under another
[5:53] spirit and another Power a power of
[5:56] another so he's bound to Christ but but
[5:59] when you break that b uh binding you
[6:01] break that tie and bind them to
[6:03] something else you rebind man of the
[6:06] house to something else is that making
[6:09] sense to you and and the the word
[6:11] picture that maybe we could draw there
[6:13] now just to help you with that in Mark
[6:15] chapter 3 where he's saying uh the to
[6:19] bind the strong men that word he's using
[6:21] to bind the strong man the same word is
[6:23] used in Luke chap 13 and just look at
[6:26] verse 11 it says behold there was a
[6:28] woman which had a spirit of infirmity
[6:29] many 18 years and was bowed together and
[6:33] could in no wise lift up herself so the
[6:37] the way that this she's being described
[6:39] is she was kind of drawn together she
[6:40] was bowed up together and could in no
[6:43] wise lift up herself so she bent forward
[6:46] and she's bowing and if we can look at
[6:48] it this way she's bowing to that
[6:50] infirmity uh she should be upright her
[6:52] shoulders should be back her backbone
[6:54] should be straight but she's bent
[6:56] forward as if to Bow under the weight
[6:58] and the birth burden of the sickness so
[7:01] in verse 16 Jesus says ought not this
[7:04] woman being a daughter of Abraham whom
[7:06] Satan hath bound low these 18 years be
[7:10] loosed from this Bond on the Sabbath day
[7:13] they were taking issue with the fact
[7:14] that he was doing on the Sabbath day and
[7:16] Jesus saying well isn't it right isn't
[7:18] it proper that this daughter of Abraham
[7:20] who's been bound by Satan there's that
[7:22] word bind the strong man she has been
[7:25] bound by Satan Satan had put a bind on
[7:28] her and in binding her physically she's
[7:31] bowing to that sickness she's under the
[7:34] power of that sickness she she can't
[7:36] stand up she can't stand for herself and
[7:39] Jesus says isn't it right that this one
[7:41] who's been bowed and is bowing down to
[7:43] Satan be loosed from this bond this is
[7:47] to be loosed from that binding except
[7:49] you first bind the strong man and what
[7:52] has happened if you would look at this
[7:54] Christ was going to lose her from that
[7:57] Christ was going to lose her from that
[7:58] time and in Mark chapter 3 Christ bound
[8:02] the one who is uh who is in control
[8:05] under his own authority in order to cast
[8:08] out demons so I know we're kind of maybe
[8:10] taking the inverse of that before Satan
[8:12] can do anything in your lives you have
[8:15] to first be loosed from the preeminence
[8:18] of Christ and there has to be a
[8:20] rebinding you have to retie yourself to
[8:22] something else so Christ came in he
[8:24] bound Satan and binding Satan he could
[8:27] cast out his devils and therefore our
[8:29] house is spoiled when we are bound by or
[8:32] bow to another power as Christians we we
[8:35] ought to be bound to Christ we want him
[8:37] to have preeminence in our lives and the
[8:38] only way Satan can have access to us is
[8:41] really if we allow it really if in our
[8:43] own power we bow to him now and this
[8:46] brings us to the language of Joshua
[8:48] chapter
[8:49] 24 and and if this seems like a little
[8:52] bit of a stretch maybe just exercise
[8:54] some of your your spiritual uh wisdom to
[8:57] see how this ties together so well
[9:00] but now as it goes forth in verse 14 he
[9:02] says now therefore fear the lord and
[9:04] serve him in sincerity and in truth now
[9:08] that's a that's a great commandment to
[9:10] us serve him fear the Lord give him
[9:12] reverence obey him serve him in
[9:14] sincerity and in truth and we must we
[9:17] must do that and in order to do that
[9:20] says and put away the gods which your
[9:22] father served on the other side of the
[9:24] flood and serve ye the Lord so this is
[9:29] give reverence and service to God and
[9:30] God alone and put away the service you
[9:33] did to other gods so there was a bowing
[9:35] down to false gods and now he's saying
[9:38] be bound to to God himself and if it
[9:41] seem evil unto you to serve the Lord
[9:44] choose you this day whom you will serve
[9:47] now they G given a choice whether the
[9:49] gods which your father served that were
[9:51] on the other side of the flood or the
[9:53] gods of the amorites in whose land you
[9:55] dwell there they could have gone back to
[9:57] some some tradition they could have been
[9:59] Bound by something in their modern times
[10:00] there but he says but as for me in my
[10:02] house and that's where I get my phrasing
[10:04] tonight as for me in my home Joshua
[10:07] speaking says but as for me and my house
[10:09] we will serve the Lord we won't bow down
[10:12] to traditions we won't bow down to
[10:14] formal Idols we won't bow down to the
[10:16] things that we served before but we will
[10:19] serve I will serve we will bow down to
[10:21] the one true God we will be bound to him
[10:24] we will fear the fear the lord serve him
[10:25] in sincerity and in truth and the people
[10:29] answered it's as if it really did
[10:30] resonate with them and the people
[10:31] answered said God forbid that we should
[10:33] forsake the Lord to serve or to bow down
[10:36] uh to give service to and be subject to
[10:39] other gods for the Lord Is Our God he is
[10:42] that brought us out brought us up in our
[10:45] fathers out of the land of Egypt from
[10:47] the house of bondage and which did those
[10:49] great signs in our sight preserved Us in
[10:51] all the way wherein we went and among
[10:53] all the people through whom we passed
[10:55] shows us that the service to other gods
[10:57] It's Not Just an Illusion to to slavery
[10:59] but it's illusion to the spiritual
[11:01] bondage he said we we served other gods
[11:03] but he's brought us out of the land of
[11:04] Egypt from the house of bondage we were
[11:07] in that place where we were bound to a
[11:09] strong man we were we were not the
[11:11] masters of our own house we were in a
[11:13] house that was in bondage and service to
[11:15] other gods is bondage to another Power
[11:17] besides God and they said we have been
[11:20] loosed so choose you this day whom you
[11:23] will serve whom you will labor under
[11:25] whom you will be subject to now this is
[11:28] relevant we could bring in a lot of
[11:29] different scriptures I know I've used it
[11:31] quite a bit I might even have a little
[11:32] bit of a complex in referring to it but
[11:34] Paul taught all things were lawful but I
[11:36] will not be brought under the power of
[11:38] any there's a lot of lawful things
[11:40] unlawfully used that become a bondage to
[11:42] us people can be in bondage to things
[11:44] that we could argue or innocent well
[11:46] what's wrong with that and what's wrong
[11:47] with that and we could say well on the
[11:49] face of it really nothing's wrong with
[11:51] it and maybe as you dig into it
[11:52] nothing's wrong with it but the power
[11:54] that it has over you is the evidence
[11:56] that there's some leaven in there
[11:58] there's something wrong there you're
[11:59] forfeiting your Liberty as a Christian
[12:01] to something that you ought to be free
[12:02] from and it's amazing the language that
[12:05] people use about their their lack of
[12:09] obedience to the word of God or even
[12:10] their worldliness and they say they're
[12:13] free they're free I'm free I don't have
[12:15] to do this anymore I'm free I don't have
[12:17] to do that and maybe they're speaking of
[12:18] a time when they were under legalism or
[12:20] they were doing things out of tradition
[12:22] and they weren't doing things with the
[12:23] free heart in the Lord but now they're
[12:25] using that verbiage to say they're free
[12:28] because now exercising themselves in in
[12:31] fleshly things they're not being
[12:32] obedient to the word and they don't
[12:33] realize that they're forfeiting their
[12:35] Liberty in Christ to something else and
[12:37] it's a worse bondage than the one they
[12:39] were under before amen so to choose whom
[12:42] you will serve is to choose who you will
[12:44] bow to choose who you'll be subject
[12:48] to and the only way that our our the way
[12:51] that our
[12:52] houses are unable to become homes is
[12:55] when we allow ourselves to bow to
[12:57] something other than the Lord
[12:59] so I won't let the strong man I won't
[13:02] let myself be bound to an idol to weaken
[13:04] my home I with Joshua is saying choose
[13:08] you this day whom you'll bow to will you
[13:10] bow to the world will you bow to
[13:12] tradition will you bow to the things
[13:14] that we thought we left will we go back
[13:16] like a dog to its vomit and a hog to its
[13:18] Waller what will you do or will you bow
[13:20] to the Lord to fear Him and to serve him
[13:22] in sincerity and in
[13:25] truth and as we read in some of those
[13:28] later vers vers verses 18 to 21 we find
[13:30] that Joshua is saying well you better
[13:32] serve the Lord because you're not going
[13:34] to be able to live under bondage to
[13:36] these other idols and be successful in
[13:38] possessing the land and it's not so much
[13:41] that God is a narcissist and he's going
[13:42] to punish them if they don't serve him
[13:44] but he's saying this is the rule this is
[13:46] God is going to give you this land
[13:47] because you serve him but if you don't
[13:49] serve him you're inviting the bondage
[13:51] you're inviting the enemy you're
[13:52] inviting uh all the problems that you
[13:55] have when Jesus leaves your home
[13:56] troubles on the way uh but it's because
[13:59] you drive them out and you make them
[14:00] unwelcome so when he says ask for me and
[14:03] my house will serve the Lord even though
[14:06] we could see that God was with them that
[14:07] God was driving the enemy out from
[14:09] before them full possession to maintain
[14:12] possession of the promised land wasn't
[14:15] relying upon a God in heaven but rather
[14:17] he brought it down to what they would be
[14:19] within their home as for me in my house
[14:22] we will serve the Lord if we're going to
[14:25] remain in possession of the promised
[14:26] land it has to begin as for me and my
[14:29] house it's going to be and I love that
[14:31] because if we if we say that together
[14:33] it's not so much just saying well if the
[14:36] wife will get her act together well if
[14:38] the children would get their act
[14:39] together or maybe the child might say oh
[14:42] if the dad will get his act together the
[14:43] wife say oh well the husband and we
[14:45] might just be able to point to someone
[14:46] but how about we say as for
[14:48] me as for me beginning with me in my
[14:52] house we will serve the Lord and that's
[14:56] where that to maintain our position in
[14:58] the promised and defin our position in
[15:00] the promised land begins in the
[15:02] house but as for me and my house that
[15:05] house even word there in the Hebrews a
[15:07] home a household or a family and here is
[15:10] a deliberate decision on Joshua's part
[15:12] and you're all very familiar with it you
[15:14] might even have kind of a nice uh uh um
[15:17] embroidery with this written on it or
[15:19] someone might have got a really good
[15:20] hipster font and put it up there in
[15:21] their their guest bathroom where it says
[15:23] as for me in my house and it's just real
[15:26] beautiful probably get it on Etsy and
[15:28] it's a deliberate decision uh to
[15:31] establish the right kind of order in the
[15:34] middle of all this it's not even in the
[15:36] midst of this challenge he makes this
[15:37] declaration as for me I'm going to serve
[15:39] the Lord as far as my home my household
[15:42] my family we're going to serve the Lord
[15:44] he's making this commitment to establish
[15:45] his heart and his house as a home for
[15:48] the Lord and I'd like to just make a
[15:51] call back to some of the prior services
[15:53] on how it's the order and the character
[15:55] of the house that makes it a home this
[15:57] is Joshua recognized there is a there is
[15:59] an order that matters to fear the lord
[16:02] and to serve him in sincerity and Truth
[16:05] he couldn't just say well we're the
[16:06] children of God We're The Chosen we're
[16:07] the blessed and it was going to work
[16:09] there had to be a recognition of order
[16:11] and a resolve to keep that proper order
[16:14] to maintain a particular position
[16:16] because he he had a duty there couldn't
[16:18] be any letup and no matter how much God
[16:21] has done for you let me challenge you
[16:22] tonight I feel so free to be able to
[16:24] challenge a Wednesday night crowd with
[16:25] this no matter how much God has done for
[16:27] you don't let up if he's brought you
[16:30] through great trials if he's healed you
[16:31] of terrible sicknesses if he's blessed
[16:33] you with wonderful jobs if he's
[16:34] answering the desires of your heart
[16:36] let's not get complacent let's not just
[16:38] settle on on our Lord say oh well look
[16:40] what he's done look what he's done let
[16:42] us recognize that there's still yet more
[16:44] to come amen yes sir I could even say
[16:47] tonight if this if this church was every
[16:49] seat was full with new new converts and
[16:52] people who' been baptized that would be
[16:54] no time to settle and say if God could
[16:56] do this how much more can he do
[16:59] that that ought to be how we face every
[17:01] situation we find ourselves in that when
[17:03] things get a little rough just look at
[17:05] what he's done and be encouraged about
[17:07] what's coming that's right I said this
[17:08] to a brother recently who's just
[17:10] expressing maybe some uncertainty as to
[17:12] his future and different things and I
[17:14] said well with what I've seen God do in
[17:16] your life already I'm kind of excited
[17:17] about what the next part holds I'm not
[17:19] worried I'm not scared I'm kind of
[17:21] thinking this is kind of like Christmas
[17:22] in February uh because who knows what's
[17:25] next God is so good to us let's not up
[17:28] in our believing but this is Joshua
[17:31] saying as for me I will serve the Lord
[17:34] and my house he's saying it started with
[17:36] him we will serve the Lord that's who we
[17:39] will labor for work for that's who we
[17:41] will be subject to that's who I'll bow
[17:44] down
[17:45] to and I'm wanting us to look at that in
[17:47] the sense of order being established now
[17:51] as I was looking over these things I I
[17:54] just feel to share this statement here
[17:56] and I don't know if it's going to be
[17:57] kind of a maybe a rough turn here so
[18:00] just hold on with me but in the sermon
[18:02] total Deliverance Brothers bream says I
[18:04] wonder this morning as Christians if we
[18:07] have yielded our own will and yielded
[18:09] ourselves so completely to God till God
[18:12] can trust us the place that he has put
[18:16] us now Joshua's command to serve God in
[18:21] sincerity and in truth was to put away
[18:24] Gods which they had served before
[18:26] disassociate from the gods of EDP eypt
[18:29] uh don't be brought back into a house of
[18:30] bondage don't serve these new gods and
[18:32] these New Traditions in the land of the
[18:34] amorites and and this is the place where
[18:37] we have been put now let us serve God
[18:39] and bow to him completely and and he
[18:42] says I wonder if we've yielded our will
[18:43] so completely to God till he can trust
[18:46] us in the place that he puts us now
[18:49] there that says a lot about placing and
[18:51] positional placing it's a place it's a
[18:53] matter of trust as we've said before
[18:55] there could be uh there's always that
[18:57] maybe a healthy debate about about what
[18:58] it means to be adopted say well I'm a
[19:00] fully placed adopted son of God when I'm
[19:02] born again wonderful can God trust
[19:04] you and you realize it's a process of
[19:06] maturing and growing with the power that
[19:08] he's given us and then we could also
[19:09] argue in another sense that as a Son of
[19:11] God you're placed under this tutorship
[19:13] of the holy spirit being taught and
[19:15] you're growing in the image of the
[19:16] father and as you grow and mature you're
[19:18] coming to a place of total trust so not
[19:21] no matter how you look at it I'm not so
[19:23] much want to get hung up on the the
[19:25] nomenclature the words to miss the truth
[19:27] the truth is God is wanting to bring us
[19:29] to a place of total Deliverance absolute
[19:32] dependence upon him are we yielded so
[19:34] much till God can trust us in the place
[19:36] that he put us says I wonder this
[19:38] morning of myself if I could be so
[19:40] yielded to God till God could trust
[19:44] me could could trust brother Neville so
[19:47] now he's saying about himself as a
[19:49] prophet now it's about the pastor could
[19:51] trust our trustee board our Deacon board
[19:55] or our members of our church now I like
[19:58] just how he brought us all in this
[19:59] together so nobody's pointing fingers
[20:02] you know the pastor hasn't found this
[20:03] quote so he can just you dirty stinking
[20:06] sheep right and just get all over your
[20:09] case about how you're living and how
[20:11] you're acting and how you're making me
[20:13] look bad if anything the opposite is
[20:15] true you guys make me look pretty good
[20:16] all my friends come in here and preach
[20:17] have such wonderful things to say and
[20:19] I'm over there going
[20:21] hey I'm I'm joking about that part they
[20:24] know it has nothing to do with me they
[20:25] know I'm not even their cup of tea
[20:28] but he says we as he brings everybody in
[20:31] says we all have a place and we got a
[20:33] duty that that's the part that really
[20:36] forms the basis of even using this quot
[20:38] quote we all have a place and we got a
[20:40] duty we all have a place we all have a
[20:42] position but with that position comes
[20:44] Duty and with that Duty become comes
[20:46] responsibility and if we have
[20:48] responsibility without accountability
[20:49] it's all
[20:50] worthless so he says the ministers got a
[20:53] place of Duty to stand and preach the
[20:54] unsearchable riches of Christ without
[20:56] compromising if he's called to be a
[20:58] preacher he wouldn't spare one thing for
[21:01] one person if he's called to be a
[21:02] preacher so if you're called to be a
[21:04] preacher you won't hold back from the
[21:06] word of God for anyone's sake you'll
[21:08] preach the word of God because you're
[21:10] called and if you're a preacher you have
[21:11] a duty to stand and preach the
[21:14] unsearchable riches of Christ without
[21:16] compromising so I could say this about
[21:18] brother Manuel about brother Chris about
[21:20] brother Reggie about brother ly the
[21:21] different ministers that we have amongst
[21:23] us we have a duty as ministers to preach
[21:26] the unsearchable riches of Christ
[21:28] without compromising and we can't hold
[21:31] back just for somebody else's sake we've
[21:33] got to preach the word that's our duty
[21:36] but now you're not going to you may not
[21:38] find yourself in this place of Duty to
[21:40] stand and preach but you find yourself
[21:43] somewhere in here whether a trustee or
[21:44] Deacon or member of a church we say we
[21:46] all have a position and we have a place
[21:48] of Duty that would just be in the house
[21:51] of the Lord but let's let's go a little
[21:52] bit beyond that let's even get in more
[21:55] real we have a position in the calling
[21:57] us housewife husband father mother even
[22:02] in the callings as it was recently
[22:03] mentioned in some of the services how
[22:05] that we might be called to be a
[22:07] particular um uh a a job title or or a
[22:12] different field of work or study these
[22:14] are things that relate to who we are as
[22:16] Christians I would argue that you know
[22:18] tomorrow morning when you leave you
[22:19] don't go you don't leave church and hang
[22:21] up your Christian hat and pick up your
[22:22] cater hat or pick up some other hat and
[22:25] say well I'm a manager at work and and
[22:27] no it's you are a Christian in whatever
[22:29] coling you are and your identity is
[22:31] wrapped up in these things that we do
[22:32] amen and so a phrase that we often hear
[22:35] is post of Duty and I would argue that
[22:38] we most often hear that phrase when when
[22:42] the pastor's trying to keep us at church
[22:43] on Sunday morning and not go visit
[22:45] another meeting but we we often hear
[22:48] this phrase Posta Duty usually related
[22:50] to church you have a poster Duty you
[22:52] have a poster Duty and we're most often
[22:55] told about a poster Duty when it relates
[22:57] to whether you're a pastor trustee
[22:59] Deacon or a member of the church and I
[23:00] will say that is true you have that post
[23:04] but a post of Duty is a it's a duty post
[23:06] it's a place where you work officially I
[23:08] think it even has some military
[23:09] connotation it's your official work side
[23:11] or station the area where one regularly
[23:13] performs duties and I want to make this
[23:15] argument that you have a post a duty not
[23:17] just in the house of God but in your
[23:19] life in your daily life a duty is an act
[23:22] or course of action that's required by
[23:24] your position by custom law religion so
[23:26] we all have a duty
[23:28] in in the way that God has made us he
[23:29] says we all have a place and we got a
[23:31] duty not just in church but in who God
[23:34] has made you as an individual as for me
[23:37] and my house so that the me in that has
[23:40] a place and a duty even within the house
[23:43] to purpose to serve the Lord so that
[23:46] post of Duty that act or course of
[23:48] action that's required by your position
[23:50] that post is the position of Duty or
[23:52] employment or the trust to which one is
[23:55] assigned or appointed and I'm I I'm say
[23:58] this tonight we're just going to have a
[23:59] few moments together this evening I'm
[24:01] not expecting to be lengthy by any
[24:03] definition but we have a post of Duty
[24:06] and that post is is not just related to
[24:10] church as for me and my house we'll
[24:13] serve the Lord was not a declaration as
[24:14] to where Joshua's going to go to
[24:16] church he's saying the Lord will be the
[24:18] one that we are bound to and this is our
[24:22] posting this is our posting as Believers
[24:24] our post to duty is to the word cannot
[24:28] have this H uh idea to where church
[24:31] becomes so preeminent and there's such
[24:32] loyalty to the pastor and there's such
[24:34] loyalty to tradition that we're willing
[24:36] to compromise the word of God to be
[24:38] loyal to our post we cannot let the
[24:41] devil get that in our
[24:42] heads I'd much rather you obey the Lord
[24:46] and do what God wants you to do than to
[24:48] just stick it out here since we're a
[24:49] young Church be where God wants you to
[24:52] be we want you to succeed we said in the
[24:54] beginning and those who are here for the
[24:56] beginning can bear witness to this I
[24:57] hold myself accountable to this that our
[24:59] desire is to see that the perfect will
[25:01] of God is fulfilled in the hearts of his
[25:04] children and if we're just here for a
[25:06] moment to help somebody along the way we
[25:08] rejoice in the fact that we had a part
[25:11] in it we would never want to develop a
[25:13] culture that would restrain somebody
[25:15] from being successful in obeying God's
[25:18] word or being at their
[25:21] post this word is our posting brother
[25:23] bam takes this scripture and says he's
[25:25] the word and he will ever be the word
[25:27] and for me and my house will serve the
[25:31] word this is the first Duty for the
[25:34] individual and for the family I've said
[25:37] it before I can't remember in what part
[25:39] uh what series it was over the last uh
[25:42] few years that we mentioned it but that
[25:44] there's this idea of focus on the family
[25:46] and I'm not trying to call out Colorado
[25:47] Springs but there's this idea of focus
[25:49] on the family and that's
[25:51] good if you're focused on the
[25:54] word but we could actually turn away
[25:56] from the will of God God by focusing on
[25:58] our family we want to be a family
[26:00] focused on the word so there there's
[26:03] maybe a little bit of retitling they can
[26:04] do but someone hurry up and trade mark
[26:05] that get the URL family focused on the
[26:08] word is what we want to be not just
[26:10] focused on the family where oh it's just
[26:12] all about the family all about the kids
[26:13] all about this all no that's not a do we
[26:15] want to obey the word of God brother
[26:17] Bram in the sermon um blind barus he
[26:19] says speaking of barus he was a provider
[26:22] for his family he thought of his family
[26:25] first before himself
[26:28] any rude any any real true
[26:31] dadle any real true dad will do that or
[26:36] husband any Christian I love this so
[26:39] it's not just us dads any Christian will
[26:41] think of others before himself I'm
[26:44] really feeling impressed to hit at the
[26:46] selfishness that Leo DEA tries to weave
[26:49] into our minds we're so much about our
[26:50] own identification and what we like and
[26:52] what we feel and I'm made a certain way
[26:54] or I need certain things we've got to
[26:56] break out of the selfishness and even
[26:59] brother Jason touched on it quite a bit
[27:01] we can't be selfish we've got to break
[27:03] out of a selfish mindset because eternal
[27:06] life is living for others not for
[27:09] yourself any real true dad will do that
[27:12] or husband any Christian will think of
[27:14] others before himself every Christian
[27:16] tries to put God first his family second
[27:19] he's number three that's why I even take
[27:22] a little issue with the I am second
[27:25] movement isn't that is that what it's
[27:27] called called I Am Second or whatever
[27:29] the whatever those those different ones
[27:30] are what would Jesus do there he's
[27:33] saying I'm I'm number three God first
[27:36] family second and I'm number three this
[27:40] is this is what I could even hearken him
[27:42] back to what brother Jason ministered
[27:44] over the weekend in marriage of the
[27:46] Alpha and Omega and those two different
[27:47] parts what a what an encouragement
[27:49] sermon encouraging sermon to know that
[27:52] if in a relationship with anyone
[27:54] especially husband to wife that if
[27:56] things aren't where they're supposed to
[27:57] be the the measure of Correction can be
[28:00] found in reestablishing your connection
[28:01] to the
[28:02] word that marital problems are often
[28:05] symptomatic of something being wrong in
[28:07] your relationship to Christ some
[28:08] misunderstanding in your view of Christ
[28:09] some misunderstanding in what the word
[28:11] requires of you some distance in your
[28:13] relationship to Christ you say oh I
[28:15] don't think my marriage can ever be
[28:16] fixed and and maybe you don't have a lot
[28:18] of things you can grab a hold of to the
[28:19] promise for your marriage but Christ has
[28:21] made an unconditional Covenant with you
[28:24] that he'll never leave you nor forsake
[28:25] you and is doing all that he can to see
[28:27] that that relationship he has with you
[28:29] is firmed up is restored is made right
[28:32] is clean and so then you could go to him
[28:34] and say Lord fix whatever it is between
[28:36] you and I and know that that can have a
[28:38] healing effect on what we are in our
[28:40] relationship to other
[28:42] people that way I could even say this
[28:44] whether it be to you to a sibling or
[28:46] mother to uh child to parent whatever it
[28:49] might be Focus first on your
[28:50] relationship to Christ as for me am I
[28:52] serving the
[28:54] lord and in then that we're saying I'm
[28:56] going to put Christ first my my first
[28:58] post is to the word try to put God first
[29:01] and then family second and I and F and
[29:04] then myself number three is how he
[29:06] orders it so our first duty is to God we
[29:10] could take from this and even as to what
[29:11] I'm trying to point out here as for me I
[29:13] will serve the Lord and my house now
[29:16] Joshua was turning his attention to his
[29:17] house not himself so much I will be
[29:20] subject to the Lord and now I will serve
[29:22] my house in a way that brings them
[29:24] subject to the word because our next
[29:26] duty is to home
[29:28] every Christian tries to put God first
[29:30] his family second himself number
[29:34] three in Luke Chapter 24: 47 this is
[29:38] very simple I'm just going to try try to
[29:42] kind of walk through this a little bit
[29:43] it's just a very simple thought as we
[29:45] continue further in this to see where
[29:48] our duty is first in Luke CH 24:47 I
[29:51] believe this is on the road to Emmas and
[29:52] as he's uh expounding on the prophecies
[29:55] he makes a statement
[29:57] which not only refers to where he's at
[30:00] in his own Ministry and what he was
[30:02] doing but uh this is more to the right
[30:06] just before his
[30:08] Ascension even as this is this is a lot
[30:10] here that we could be reading but I
[30:12] think I'm just going to pull this one
[30:13] scripture here so this is after his
[30:15] resurrection this is where he's speaking
[30:16] to the uh uh the children of Israel or
[30:19] speaking to the disciples soon going to
[30:21] be uh ascended up he's going to open up
[30:24] their understanding the scripture he
[30:25] says and that repentance and remission
[30:28] of sins should be preached in his name
[30:31] among all nations beginning at
[30:35] Jerusalem notice how he says this as
[30:37] he's going to as he's gone through this
[30:40] and I realized maybe there was a lot
[30:41] more here that I could have expressed
[30:43] for time sake I'll just pull this part
[30:45] out here as he's coming to the
[30:47] conclusion of his Earthly Ministry he's
[30:48] going to send up he's not going to be
[30:50] with them anymore he's tell them what's
[30:51] to come as he's going to give them the
[30:54] Great Commission to go into all the
[30:55] world and preach the gospel says and
[30:57] that repentance and remission of sins
[30:59] should be preached in his name among all
[31:00] nations and he says beginning at
[31:04] Jerusalem they were to go out and preach
[31:06] to all the world but he doesn't send
[31:08] them out to the world first he tells
[31:10] them to start in Jerusalem it must begin
[31:13] at Jerusalem and in Acts chap 1:8 it
[31:16] says but ye shall receive power after
[31:18] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[31:20] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me but
[31:23] not just uh uh in Jerusalem he says both
[31:26] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[31:29] Samaria and under the uttermost part of
[31:31] the earth so what we could see here is
[31:34] that God wanted Jesus wanted that this
[31:36] gospel would go to all the world but
[31:38] he's not just going to send them to the
[31:40] world first he sends them home first
[31:42] that's right he sends them to Jerusalem
[31:44] first you got to start at home he says
[31:46] the gospel's got to be preached the
[31:48] gospel's got to be lived but the most
[31:49] effective place you want it to be first
[31:51] the place that you want to have a
[31:52] testimony the place where you want to
[31:54] begin to establish it is within your own
[31:56] personal individual life it's amazing
[32:00] sometimes how there's people who give Li
[32:02] lip service to Christ are always
[32:03] witnessing they're always sharing these
[32:05] things but their lives are shambles they
[32:07] won't humble themselves to the word of
[32:09] God they don't apply the token to their
[32:10] home they don't love their wives as they
[32:12] ought to there's a whole mess at home
[32:14] but they use this this language in their
[32:16] mouth uh uh to lift up the Lord and give
[32:18] these platitudes and try to have some
[32:20] sort of Fain humility or a sincerity and
[32:23] where it got it needs to begin first is
[32:26] at home Amen Let The Gospel be preached
[32:29] and expressed first at
[32:31] Jerusalem so it starts at home there's
[32:33] your Jerusalem then once it's being
[32:36] witnessed at home then Judea there's
[32:38] your neighborhood there's your job
[32:39] there's school there's the local there's
[32:40] the little bit broader expansion then
[32:43] Samaria maybe it gets a little bit
[32:44] bigger State County however you want to
[32:46] look at it and then the world but it's
[32:48] got to first start at home what what
[32:51] witness in Ministry do you really have
[32:53] in the world if you come back home and
[32:56] there's no Ministry Min it's identifying
[32:59] the proper order of things I really
[33:00] believe it's pointing to what God values
[33:03] beginning at
[33:05] Jerusalem that our duty is to God and
[33:08] what God wants us to first begin to have
[33:10] a testimony is at
[33:12] home in 1 Timothy chapter
[33:15] 3: we start with verse 2
[33:19] to13 it says I'm going to read this
[33:22] together maybe look at a few points as
[33:24] we go now speaking of a pastor says a
[33:27] bishop then must be
[33:29] blameless the husband of one wife now
[33:32] why why does it have that
[33:34] requirement breakout session anybody
[33:36] want to debate
[33:38] this he must be blameless that's a
[33:40] mouthful but it says the husband of one
[33:41] wife now the reason why he is to be
[33:43] husband of one wife is because he's
[33:45] going to teach
[33:46] you right going to teach marriage and
[33:49] remarriage going to teach marriage and
[33:51] the consequences of divorce and it is he
[33:54] is not going to be affected because the
[33:56] teaching is a establish in righteousness
[33:57] the throne is established in
[33:58] righteousness and what kind of hypocrisy
[34:01] would it be to say hey I know I got a
[34:03] couple wives but you shouldn't have any
[34:05] more than one right his life undermines
[34:07] his example undermines and so the
[34:10] scripture tells us that what God values
[34:12] and what how a pastor should be in his
[34:14] own life speaks to what God values in
[34:16] the teaching the husband of one wife and
[34:18] then notice Vigilant sober of good
[34:20] behavior given to hospitality apt to
[34:23] teach there's a little bit of a
[34:24] misunderstanding maybe where we say the
[34:27] Deacon should be apt to teach but that's
[34:28] just a remnant of the bylaws of brandom
[34:30] Tabernacle it's the bishop that should
[34:32] be apt to teach says not given to Wine
[34:35] no Striker not greedy a filthy ler but
[34:37] patient not a brawler not
[34:41] Covetous these are the characteristics
[34:43] that a pastor should have this is one
[34:46] that ruleth well his own house having
[34:49] his own his children in subjection with
[34:52] all
[34:54] gravity now that word gravity means
[34:56] honesty y that which entitles one a
[34:58] person to respect so it's not that he
[35:01] rules his house as a dictator not that
[35:04] he's been able to scare every person
[35:06] into that house into doing what he wants
[35:08] him to do but he rules the house in such
[35:11] a way to where they respect him they
[35:14] have respect for him so these are the
[35:17] qualifications for a pastor one that
[35:19] ruleth well his own house having his own
[35:21] children subjection with all gravity
[35:23] with all honesty with respect and then
[35:26] this statement I'm not really trying to
[35:28] put myself on the hot seat by reading
[35:30] those few verses there but I wanted to
[35:31] come to this for if a man know not how
[35:34] to rule his own house how shall he take
[35:36] care of the Church of God Amen now as
[35:38] we've used this before we've shown that
[35:40] it's not the fact that the man's a
[35:42] pastor that gives him full Sway in the
[35:45] right to be respected within his home
[35:47] it's not the office that he has
[35:49] spiritually the office that he might
[35:50] have in the church that demands and
[35:52] requires the respect at home but rather
[35:54] his life at home is what would give rise
[35:56] to his suitability to be a
[35:59] pastor if a man doesn't know how to rule
[36:02] his house correctly not with an iron
[36:04] fist not as a dictator not abusing his
[36:06] children not being verbally abusive not
[36:08] being a brawler not being a striker not
[36:10] being greedy a filthy lcer not having
[36:12] good behavior if all these other things
[36:13] are wrong if he doesn't know how to rule
[36:15] his own life if he doesn't how to rule
[36:17] his own house how then can you expect
[36:19] him to take care of the Church of
[36:22] God then it continues not a novice L
[36:24] being lifted up with the pride he fall
[36:26] the condemnation of the devil moreover
[36:29] he must have a good report of them which
[36:32] are
[36:33] without this is a this is quite a
[36:36] statement does he have a good testimony
[36:39] amongst those he deals with in public is
[36:42] he known as a a businessman who cheats
[36:44] is he known as a liar is he known as a
[36:46] brawler is he known as one that's rude
[36:48] and and arrogant I mean this is he said
[36:52] he's got to have a testimony not just be
[36:54] able to uh wow you when he's behind the
[36:56] the pulpit what about his
[36:58] life lest he fall into reproach and the
[37:01] snare of the devil likewise must the
[37:03] deacons be grave not double tonged not
[37:07] given too much wine not greedy of filthy
[37:11] lucer the deacons fill on the hot seat
[37:14] yet I mean I got it on me now we let's
[37:16] just keep moving on
[37:18] here hold in the mystery of the faith in
[37:21] a pure
[37:22] conscience and let these also first be
[37:25] proved
[37:27] then let them use the office of a deacon
[37:29] being found
[37:30] blameless this is Paul I know there's a
[37:33] lot here that you could unpack a lot
[37:34] that can be attributed to deacons a lot
[37:36] that we could attribute to the office of
[37:37] a pastor but I'm wanting you to
[37:39] recognize that in the eyes of Paul the
[37:41] life that one lived at home amongst his
[37:44] family and amongst the people was the
[37:47] life that mattered most because if this
[37:49] was chaotic it wouldn't do any good in
[37:51] the house of God it wasn't just make a
[37:53] man a deacon and then you just give the
[37:55] seal of approval that whatever he says
[37:57] and whatever he does is right and we
[37:59] just kind of lift certain people in this
[38:00] Echelon and create an elite class in the
[38:02] house of God they first must be
[38:05] proved and then I love how as he said
[38:07] these things about a deacon he says even
[38:10] so their
[38:11] wives beg graved that mean doesn't mean
[38:14] in the grave even so must their wise beg
[38:17] graved not slanderer sober faithful in
[38:19] all
[38:21] things this means that the wife
[38:23] shouldn't be a busy body I would say the
[38:25] pastor or the deacons shouldn't be one
[38:26] that's always talking and running things
[38:28] down and the one that you could get the
[38:29] scoop from they shouldn't be an expert
[38:32] in the
[38:33] tea but even so must their wives be
[38:36] grave not slander sober faithful in all
[38:38] things let the deacons be the husbands
[38:40] of one wife ruling their children and
[38:43] their own house as well why because if
[38:45] their house isn't right what they're
[38:47] doing in the oppos at church isn't going
[38:49] to be right as he's already said lest
[38:52] they fall in reproach or lest they fall
[38:54] into condemnation in other words if
[38:56] things aren't where they should be at
[38:58] home it get provides a source of
[39:01] weakness in the office at
[39:04] church in a
[39:06] de it's true for they that have used the
[39:10] office of a deacon well purchased to
[39:12] themselves a good degree wow and great
[39:15] boldness in the faith which is in Christ
[39:18] Jesus and because of that it's so
[39:21] important that the home be right
[39:25] first brother brandham even talks about
[39:27] it if in a situation where if something
[39:29] happened he said would take me out of
[39:30] the
[39:31] pulpit and and it wasn't it was him just
[39:34] recognizing that if if these things
[39:36] happened then then I'm losing I I I lose
[39:39] the confidence of the people and and
[39:41] things begin to lose their
[39:43] order and so I could I would
[39:46] argue whether we want to call it Church
[39:48] order or the church office whether it be
[39:50] Deacon or trustee and any any other
[39:52] office that we could find especially
[39:53] that of a pastor the church order can
[39:56] cannot undermine family order good amen
[39:59] we don't establish Church order as a
[40:01] means of usurping family order as a
[40:03] matter of fact we're taught that the
[40:05] women are to learn at
[40:06] home and that tells me that when it says
[40:09] they're not to speak or to usurp
[40:11] Authority in the house of God it's not
[40:13] to create another husband at church no
[40:17] right not at all but it's to establish
[40:20] it in the home the man ought to be in
[40:22] his place and that the woman's to learn
[40:24] at home it establishes a different order
[40:26] meaning that what you might have at
[40:28] church isn't the ultimate but a family
[40:30] is the
[40:31] ultimate that church order does not flip
[40:33] upside down family order as a matter of
[40:35] fact Church order is just a type of
[40:37] family
[40:38] order therefore we don't sacrifice the
[40:41] family for the
[40:42] church that's beautiful we're not
[40:44] sacrificing our families for
[40:46] it because it's duty to the family first
[40:50] because if family isn't right service to
[40:52] church isn't
[40:55] right good service to church is not what
[40:58] gives you a good
[41:00] testimony a good testimony at home
[41:02] qualifies you for service at
[41:04] church a good testimony amongst others a
[41:07] good testimony in your family qualifies
[41:08] you for a greater service for an office
[41:10] in the church it's not it doesn't work
[41:13] the other way around that you just put
[41:14] someone in office and that kind of
[41:16] they're they to be trusted they're to be
[41:17] believed they're to have the authority
[41:18] well because they're this and they're
[41:20] that and the F and the church that means
[41:21] they have a particular respect and
[41:23] Authority you respect the office but a
[41:25] man gains that respect when he lives the
[41:27] kind of life before his family brother
[41:29] says lives the kind of life that the
[41:30] family can
[41:32] respect so it's a good testimony at home
[41:35] that qualifies us for service in church
[41:38] brother Brandon says in the token we are
[41:40] responsible to him not to a church we
[41:43] are responsible to God and to his word
[41:45] and God is the word the Bible said he
[41:47] was we're responsible to that so again I
[41:50] I'm just taking this time tonight to
[41:52] show that our duty is at home first as
[41:55] for me and my house will serve the Lord
[41:59] and if we could have that part if that
[42:01] part could be understood oh man it makes
[42:03] it so much better at home as brother
[42:05] Jason even emphasized I I thought it was
[42:07] wonderfully encouraging to see the
[42:08] continuity of the things that have been
[42:09] ministered lately how that we we uh a
[42:13] church is not made up a strong church is
[42:15] made up of strong families is how we
[42:16] were putting it and the same thing that
[42:19] brother Jason came and repeated that
[42:21] really the strength of a church is is
[42:22] found in the strength of the unions that
[42:24] make up the families and we're
[42:27] responsible to him as for me and my
[42:29] house will'll serve the Lord it's not
[42:31] just this commitment to go to church
[42:33] it's a commitment to serve
[42:34] God that's it brother that's what we're
[42:37] responsible to Titus Chapter 1 veres 6 7
[42:41] and 8 and it's talking about in verse 5
[42:44] he's talking about ordaining Elders in
[42:45] all the cities where they were lacking
[42:47] pastors so it shows us that this was
[42:49] something that was needful and if any
[42:51] any man or Bishop be blameless the
[42:53] husband of one wife having faithful
[42:55] children not a accused of Riot or
[42:58] unruly not being lwd fellas of the baser
[43:01] sort not accused of of rebellion and
[43:05] Disobedience and those words there
[43:07] accused of r or unruly for Bishop must
[43:10] be blameless as the steward of God noce
[43:13] not self-willed not soon angry not given
[43:16] to Wine no Striker not given to Filthy
[43:18] lcer but a lover of hospitality a lover
[43:20] of Good Men sober just holy temper he
[43:22] keeps going and in Titus he's
[43:24] establishing the role of Pastor
[43:26] as men uh women children he's showing
[43:29] that we all have a duty we all have a
[43:31] post in our own individual lives that
[43:33] we've got to
[43:36] keep the the his marital relationship
[43:43] matters and if it matters I would say
[43:45] the reason why it would
[43:48] matter for the pastor is because it
[43:51] matters for all of
[43:53] us it matters for all of us
[43:57] I think that I if I could say
[44:01] this I want to be able to say this the
[44:03] right
[44:06] way if you make brother brandham your
[44:08] pastor you've given yourself the biggest
[44:10] excuse to live your life however you
[44:13] want because he's he's
[44:16] gone all we have is the tapes we press
[44:20] play and Obey he's my pastor you do that
[44:24] because you don't want to change
[44:26] you do that because you want to just do
[44:28] the minimum of play a
[44:31] tape and just nod your
[44:33] head right but when God when God brings
[44:37] us together as humans and we're all in
[44:39] this together and we're striving for the
[44:42] same thing together and God doesn't give
[44:44] you a pastor H who's dead and in the
[44:46] grave and can't answer questions or God
[44:48] just doesn't give you a pastor that you
[44:49] listen to on tape but it gives you one
[44:51] with Humanity gives you one with family
[44:53] gives you one with relationships and you
[44:55] realize we're in This Together the
[44:57] reason why God has requirements for
[44:58] office isn't because those in office are
[45:01] special though brother Bram says he's a
[45:02] special man it's because we're all
[45:04] called to a standard of the word of God
[45:07] and we want to meet the mark in this age
[45:10] together yes and so these
[45:12] responsibilities as a husband of one
[45:14] wife and ruling our homes with all
[45:16] gravity and all these different things
[45:18] it doesn't mean that the W the Deacon's
[45:20] wife shouldn't be slanderers Nobody's
[45:22] Wife should be a
[45:23] slanderer right the sister shouldn't
[45:25] leave tonight like thank God I'm not
[45:27] married to a deacon right nobody nobody
[45:31] should be leaving tonight saying man I'm
[45:32] glad I'm not the pastor or Deacon I can
[45:34] get as married many times as I want and
[45:35] my wife can be a gossiper no these
[45:38] standards are there because of the
[45:39] influence because of the example because
[45:41] we would say let us none of us be
[45:43] subject to these things let's strive
[45:45] together for these things that's right
[45:47] so it's the image that's being created
[45:49] within the house of the Lord as an
[45:51] example for what God wants to achieve in
[45:53] your own individual lives as for me in
[45:55] my house
[45:56] in 1 Timothy 5:8 as we come back to
[45:59] Timothy as Paul is expressing these
[46:01] things to Timothy you find such
[46:03] beautiful symmetry between Timothy and
[46:04] Titus but he says it this way but if any
[46:07] provide not for his own and especially
[46:10] for those of his own house he ha denied
[46:14] the faith and is worse than an
[46:17] Infidel if we could put it in the same
[46:19] vein of 1 Timothy chapter 3 that a
[46:22] bishop must be blameless a husband of
[46:23] one wife and Vigilant sober good
[46:25] behavior given to hospitality and all
[46:27] these things not given to wine all these
[46:28] different characteristics that don't
[46:30] describe him as much behind the pulpit
[46:32] it says he's apt to teach and we can say
[46:34] oh well that's teaching behind the
[46:36] pulpit but really everything that's
[46:37] mentioned here has to do with his
[46:39] personal life and his testimony not
[46:42] among church folk but people in the
[46:44] community and abroad and even the same
[46:46] about the Deacon's wife we realize that
[46:48] what saying if any man provide not for
[46:50] his own especially for those of his own
[46:52] house he Deni he's denied the faith and
[46:54] is worse than an infid
[46:56] we can say that it's the life at home
[46:59] his testimony amongst his family his
[47:01] relationship with his wife and his
[47:03] children
[47:04] matter because if he for forsakes that
[47:07] if he does not provide for his own
[47:10] especially of his own family he denies
[47:12] the Faith No matter how much lip service
[47:15] we could give if we don't provide first
[47:18] for our own and for our families we deny
[47:21] the faith and is worse than an Infidel
[47:23] now that's you know chew on that for a
[47:25] few seconds
[47:27] worse than an
[47:28] Infidel so it emphasizes the importance
[47:30] of the duty we have to our
[47:32] house true we could we could take this
[47:35] and we could look at in the sense of a
[47:36] man who works and provides therefore if
[47:38] he's not feeding his wife he's not
[47:40] feeding his children if he's not taking
[47:41] care of his his family and then those in
[47:43] the household of faith he denies the
[47:45] faith and we're looking at maybe in
[47:47] provision and care but I believe it
[47:48] means more than
[47:51] that brother bam said in talking about
[47:53] the Tabernacle says this is a nice
[47:55] building and and we've done a lot to
[47:56] make the outside look good but it's our
[47:58] duty to make the inside right by the
[48:00] grace of God and just as he drew that
[48:02] parallel about A House Is Not a Home
[48:04] Without order and character it's our
[48:06] duty to make the inside of the house
[48:08] right by the grace of God I didn't
[48:11] provide these quotes in uh in the slide
[48:14] Deck with you but listen to this if you
[48:15] could we're just about finished here
[48:17] brother bandam says in 1964 make your
[48:19] home nice make your home a place where
[48:22] your daughter or son will not be ashamed
[48:24] to bring their company before their
[48:25] father and mother and into their house
[48:28] and make home so happy they'll be
[48:30] pleased in their home to stay there amen
[48:32] that's a challenge and talk about a
[48:35] challenge he's not saying hey you know
[48:37] what you need to
[48:38] compromise right you need to get the
[48:40] Netflix premium and you need to get a
[48:42] big screen you need to do this in order
[48:43] to keep your kids at home he's not
[48:44] saying that but I believe it tells us
[48:46] there's a way that we can conduct
[48:48] ourselves without compromising to make
[48:50] our home nice to make our home a place
[48:52] where our children want to bring their
[48:54] friends a place where they're happy to
[48:56] be and pleased to stay am and that's not
[49:00] going to be accomplished by bowing to
[49:03] the
[49:03] world and it's not going to be
[49:05] accomplished by you being a dictator but
[49:07] it can only be accomplished by you
[49:09] serving the lord and saying oh God help
[49:12] me to be a home builder help me to be a
[49:14] home maker that I may make my home nice
[49:16] for my family this is a commandment post
[49:19] seals if I could put it that way to make
[49:21] our homes happy for our
[49:23] children cuz it's our duty to make the
[49:25] inside right by the grace of God you
[49:28] have more influence you have a greater
[49:30] connection to your children because your
[49:31] Nature's in them to bring out the best
[49:34] in them to form relationships with them
[49:35] to make them feel secure to make them
[49:38] happy and not just pushing it off to the
[49:41] technology of this world not just
[49:42] pushing it off to the things of the
[49:44] world but be present with your children
[49:45] establishing real good relationships
[49:47] have a meeting of the minds with them
[49:49] talk to them communicate with them have
[49:51] things that you do together and your
[49:53] children even if it's not flashy even if
[49:55] it's not entertainment even if it's not
[49:56] expensive even if it's not gaming
[49:58] systems and music and movies there's a
[50:00] way that you as a parent can bond with
[50:02] your child that makes a house a
[50:05] home hallu say Amen if God's done it for
[50:08] you and your family amen says in the
[50:11] message influence again this is in
[50:12] November 63 oh to a home if we made home
[50:15] more lovely children wouldn't want to
[50:17] run
[50:19] away make things more for them where
[50:22] they feel welcome and nice and
[50:23] comfortable at home we're home they
[50:26] can't hardly wait till they get there
[50:28] Elliot why are you
[50:33] leaving that was horrible timing son
[50:36] just horrible can't hardly wait to
[50:40] leave make can feel welcome and nice and
[50:42] com he knows I'm coming to an end I he
[50:44] might be playing the everybody's leaving
[50:45] now hold on
[50:47] wait or they feel welcome and nice and
[50:50] comfortable at home we're home they
[50:51] can't hardly wait till they get there
[50:53] and that's the way home should be
[50:56] can I get a witness isn't that the way
[50:59] it should be children right anybody
[51:02] who's ever lived in a home that's always
[51:04] tension and on edge and you're afraid of
[51:06] how dad's going to fly off the handle or
[51:08] mom's going to do this and do that
[51:10] horrible place to be that's right and
[51:12] where does that start it's not the kids
[51:15] getting their act right it's us as the
[51:18] men in the house first and as for
[51:20] me I'll serve the Lord amen parents
[51:23] binding their hearts together so let's
[51:24] make this home nice let let our love for
[51:27] each other become an example for our
[51:30] children a home more lovely where
[51:32] children don't want to run away where
[51:34] things are for them where they feel
[51:35] welcome nice and comfortable at home
[51:37] again that's a challenge because we
[51:38] don't want to just compromise and let
[51:40] the children run the house but it tells
[51:42] us there's a way that we can rule amen
[51:45] that the children feel at peace the
[51:48] children feel at
[51:49] home he said that's the way home should
[51:52] be has anybody ever heard the phrase
[51:54] charity begins at home I think we
[51:57] probably have all heard that before it's
[51:59] interpreted to mean one's first
[52:00] responsibility is for the needs of the
[52:03] family and I think it's most often used
[52:05] in the sense that our giving should be
[52:07] first to our
[52:09] own and and and in terms of giving and
[52:11] financial worth or even as the Bible
[52:13] says if any man provide not for his own
[52:14] charity begins at home that I've got to
[52:16] give food to my family first I got to
[52:18] provide their clothing and I got to pay
[52:20] the bills and then if I have any left
[52:21] over then I'll give to a charity but you
[52:23] know it often for most people since they
[52:26] interpret it that way it just means that
[52:27] it ends there as well not only does it
[52:29] begin there it ends there but it has a
[52:32] greater meaning charity begins at home
[52:35] isn't just in giving or providing
[52:39] natural things but Charity's learned at
[52:42] home love begins at home charity is
[52:46] first planted and cultivated at
[52:52] home when we say charity begins at home
[52:54] it's exactly what Jesus said meant I say
[52:56] exactly please forgive me but let me
[52:58] just make the connection the gospel must
[53:00] be preached to All Nations first at
[53:04] Jerusalem preach the gospel to All
[53:07] Nations live it first at home because
[53:09] it's going to begin at home first no man
[53:11] should be preaching the gospel unless
[53:12] he's first met God On The Backs side of
[53:14] the desert and that's not just an
[53:15] experience for a preacher it's an
[53:16] experience for all of us we must have
[53:18] first met God On The Backs side of the
[53:19] desert our hearts must first be a home
[53:21] to him if we're ever going to make our
[53:23] dwelling a home and then we bring that
[53:26] responsibility these Gates of Heaven we
[53:28] bring this responsibility down to where
[53:30] I must first be responsible at home
[53:33] because charity is first learned at home
[53:35] these great Christian virtues are first
[53:37] planted at home and cultivated at home
[53:40] Ephesians 533 nevertheless let every one
[53:42] of you in particular so love his wife
[53:45] even as himself in other words husbands
[53:47] love your wives and wife see that she
[53:50] reverence her husband why because love
[53:53] is first leared at home respect respect
[53:55] is learned at home amen responsibility
[53:58] honesty all these things you name it is
[54:01] first learned at
[54:04] home obedience at home leads to
[54:06] obedience
[54:09] abroad that's why we say as for me in my
[54:13] house I'll serve the Lord in other words
[54:16] as for me in my home this is where it
[54:18] begins because home building and home
[54:20] making is God's way of expressing his
[54:22] word amen and we could and then and if
[54:26] I'll say it this way just so you
[54:27] understand my burden Vision even saying
[54:29] these things at church we're to be
[54:31] taught the word we learn these things at
[54:34] the house of God in the house of God
[54:36] we're taught the word of God but then
[54:37] when we go home that's where we put it
[54:39] into
[54:39] practice that's where it matters the
[54:43] most
[54:44] if if I could if I could put it this way
[54:48] and to use a sports analogy which I know
[54:50] nobody hears into sports uh that a team
[54:53] practices throughout the whole week week
[54:55] in order to play the game in football at
[54:57] least or in these different inters they
[54:58] practice in order to play the game in
[55:00] football there's practice Monday Tuesday
[55:02] all the way through played the game on
[55:03] Sunday and I think football's kind of
[55:06] crept into churches anymore we're all
[55:09] Monday to Saturday is is just build up
[55:11] for
[55:12] church and we've got it completely
[55:15] backwards and and we've turned we've
[55:17] turned even our church services into pep
[55:19] rallies for the climactic game on and
[55:22] that's not what it's all about we come
[55:25] to church and this is where we're
[55:26] learning this is where we study this is
[55:28] the word is rightly divided and the
[55:30] various gifts that come take things from
[55:32] the word of God and brother bam says a
[55:33] Minister's got a duty to search to
[55:35] preach the unsearchable riches of Christ
[55:37] without compromise because you as a
[55:39] Believer listening to that word of God
[55:40] and then when you go home you're
[55:42] actually playing the game that's where
[55:44] you're putting into practice all that
[55:46] you've
[55:49] practiced and that's why we talk about
[55:53] practice it's for the playoffs
[55:57] it's for the payoff at home at church we
[56:00] learn the word but at home we live it am
[56:03] and if it isn't practice at
[56:05] home on we're just playing church we
[56:09] might as well just call this magic the
[56:15] Gathering right Pokemon
[56:18] Tabernacle how does that sound Doom
[56:20] Lings
[56:22] Fellowship Moon raker Church
[56:25] am I missing anybody's favorite card
[56:27] game might as well I know it sounds
[56:30] funny but it's true if we're not if
[56:32] we're not living the life this is just a
[56:35] card game this is a bingo parlor this is
[56:38] a bowling
[56:41] alley that's right it's got to be
[56:43] practiced at
[56:45] home it's true we could say a lot more
[56:50] but we'll save it when everyone else is
[56:51] here on
[56:53] Sunday praise the Lord
[56:57] because maybe someone say it's not fair
[56:58] that it gets tight like that on a
[56:59] Wednesday
[57:00] night but you know you're the ones that
[57:02] are putting it into practice amen you're
[57:05] the ones that know what it means to that
[57:07] kids eat
[57:08] free because your kids got to get up
[57:10] early in the morning and they're here
[57:13] you got to drive an hour to get back
[57:14] home probably get up early to go to work
[57:16] brother John you probably got have to
[57:17] get 3:30 in the morning probably to fly
[57:19] an airplane and people are here they
[57:20] they got schedules they got lives they
[57:22] live different families drive along
[57:24] distances even even ones that they spend
[57:27] their time in the nursery on a on a
[57:28] Wednesday night but they're here because
[57:30] they want their children here they're
[57:32] recognizing the value of the things of
[57:33] God not because they love church but
[57:35] because they love the Lord and they want
[57:37] to live overcoming lives and they
[57:38] recognize the value of the word in
[57:40] moments like this are helping them to
[57:44] overcome God help
[57:46] us maybe this could be our prayer as the
[57:49] musicians come to their
[57:51] instruments this is a prayer that
[57:53] brother brandham prays
[57:55] and does God ever change his mind about
[57:57] his word he says dear Lord Jesus maybe
[57:59] you can make this a prayer just in your
[58:00] hearts now thinking of this dear Lord
[58:03] Jesus we are assembled again in your
[58:05] name with great expectation for the
[58:07] outpouring of the quickening power of
[58:10] God and listen to these beautiful words
[58:13] to bring us into recognition of our
[58:15] position and place and our
[58:18] responsibilities as being a called
[58:20] people separated from the world
[58:23] dedicated to God
[58:25] think of this language the outpouring or
[58:28] the quickening power of God and maybe he
[58:31] doesn't go to the place that a lot of us
[58:33] might think he means when he talks like
[58:36] that but it's to bring us to the
[58:38] ultimate a recognition of our position
[58:40] in place a recognition of our
[58:45] responsibilities our responsibilities as
[58:47] called people the quickening power of
[58:49] God to separate us from the world to be
[58:51] dedicated to God grant Lord tonight that
[58:53] the blessings of God will guide gu us
[58:55] and direct us in the things we do or say
[58:57] that it might bring honor and glory to
[58:59] your name amen now that's what I want
[59:01] the quickening power of God to do I
[59:04] believe in the power of God to restore
[59:06] limbs I believe in the power of God to
[59:08] cause a cancer to dissipate like that I
[59:10] believe in the power of God to make
[59:11] cross eyes straight I believe in the
[59:13] power of God to raise the dead I believe
[59:15] in miracles signs and wonders the
[59:17] manifestations of the gifts gifts
[59:19] operate in the church whether you want
[59:20] tongues or prophecies I believe that our
[59:23] worship ought to have feeling in it
[59:24] believe in all those things but at the
[59:26] end of the day the ultimate of the
[59:29] outpouring of the quickening power of
[59:30] God is that he would guide us and direct
[59:33] us in the things we do or say that it
[59:35] might bring honor and glory to his name
[59:38] oh May there be an outpouring of the
[59:40] quickening power of God to bring us into
[59:42] recognition of our position and place to
[59:44] know our responsibilities because we are
[59:46] a called people separated from the world
[59:49] dedicated to God oh I will bow no more
[59:53] to the world but I will serve
[59:56] God as for me in my home we will serve
[1:00:01] we will bow to the Lord do we need help
[1:00:06] oh we need we need his help stand today
[1:00:10] with me
