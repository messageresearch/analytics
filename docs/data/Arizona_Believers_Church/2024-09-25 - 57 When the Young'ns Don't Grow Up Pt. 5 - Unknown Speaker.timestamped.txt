[0:00] I wanted to read those extra portions
[0:02] there um from verses 17 to 24 uh because
[0:06] he's talking about learning you have not
[0:07] so learned Christ you're different than
[0:10] uh the Gentiles and how they walk and if
[0:13] you have heard him and you are being
[0:14] taught by him then you ought to be
[0:17] putting off the things related to your
[0:19] former life which uh were fashioned and
[0:22] nurtured according to a natural nature
[0:25] and that comes by that corrupt birth of
[0:28] a a human being being born of a woman
[0:30] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[0:33] mind which reading on Sunday how we are
[0:35] to be our minds are to be transformed
[0:37] and by the renewing of our minds are
[0:39] being transformed from natural things
[0:41] and Earthly things to the mind of Christ
[0:44] and in doing that we're putting on a new
[0:46] man we're we're setting him forth and
[0:48] he's coming to preeminence and it's
[0:50] created by God in righteousness and true
[0:53] Holiness and so if you could just keep
[0:54] those things in mind as we continue
[0:56] tonight on the thought of when the
[0:58] youngans don't grow up
[1:00] and we know that God's will for us is
[1:04] perfection and that the purpose of the
[1:06] Holy Spirit and the word is to place the
[1:09] believer and so tonight I'm wanting to
[1:12] explore and I know that we've done this
[1:13] uh several times already uh but I want
[1:16] to explore the subject of adoption not
[1:18] just repeating principles that we've
[1:19] used before but more uh from the word of
[1:23] God from the message of the hour on the
[1:24] subject of adoption because I believe
[1:26] it's a very very
[1:28] critical uh uh part of the process of
[1:31] God especially in the time that we're
[1:32] living now brother Braham called this
[1:34] adoption time and it's that time he said
[1:36] in parable of the church this time where
[1:38] God is placing his church so if you look
[1:41] at Ephesians chap 4: 15 and 16 and uh
[1:46] trying to be uh just more relaxed
[1:48] tonight I asked someone in my family
[1:51] last Wednesday I said did it seem like
[1:53] the people were just kind of uptight at
[1:54] the start of the preaching and they they
[1:57] said no you were and so uh I apologize
[2:01] for killing the vibe last Wednesday
[2:03] night try not to do it tonight but you
[2:05] just pray for me in Ephesians chapter 4
[2:07] verses 15 and 16 says but speaking the
[2:11] truth in love these are the gifts that
[2:13] God has given to men uh that are used in
[2:17] in the fivefold Ministries we might say
[2:19] they're to speak the truth in love that
[2:22] in speaking that we may grow up into
[2:25] Christ in all things which is the head
[2:28] it says even Christ so we're to grow
[2:29] grow up through the edification of the
[2:32] word of God from whom the whole body
[2:34] fitly joined together and compacted by
[2:36] that which every joint supplieth
[2:38] according to the effectual working and
[2:39] the measure of every part we see the
[2:41] human body in View and how that there's
[2:43] nutrients and there's nourishment to
[2:46] increase that cause the nature of the
[2:48] person to grow into those bounds of its
[2:51] DNA and all its potential and its
[2:53] physical development it's intellectual
[2:55] capacity it says making increase of the
[2:57] body unto the edifying of itself the
[3:00] building of itself it's its
[3:02] establishment in love so there's two
[3:04] critical things he says to speak the
[3:07] truth in love and that we're to edify
[3:08] ourselves in love I believe that we
[3:11] could take Ephesians 4 and narrow it
[3:14] down narrow one of the principles that's
[3:16] being uh established in this is that the
[3:18] purpose of the indwelling of the Holy
[3:20] Ghost by your birth at the time that
[3:23] you're sealed by the Holy Ghost is to
[3:24] cause you to grow that it's not the
[3:27] sense that well you've got the Holy
[3:29] Ghost you're born again you're done and
[3:31] you're finished and that the kind of the
[3:34] what you do then is just try to use your
[3:36] resources to support evangelism so that
[3:38] somebody else can be saved but there's a
[3:40] shaping there's a honing there's a
[3:41] perfecting that takes place in a
[3:43] believer's life once they've been born
[3:45] again and you'll find that it's so that
[3:47] we no longer remain children but that we
[3:49] grow up to maturity that you henceforth
[3:52] be no more children it says and that we
[3:54] wouldn't be tossed about and we wouldn't
[3:56] be instable that's the purpose of the
[3:59] Holy ghost and that's I say that to
[4:03] minister Grace to those whove receiv
[4:04] received the Holy Ghost and still find
[4:06] ah things have been a little Topsy Turvy
[4:09] things haven't always gone the way that
[4:10] I wanted them to well that's because
[4:12] you're still in a physical body and
[4:15] still have a very human spirit that Wars
[4:18] against the newness of life that's down
[4:20] inside your soul and you've got to learn
[4:22] to yield you've got to learn to feed
[4:23] that Holy Ghost experience you've got to
[4:25] learn to make difficult decisions to
[4:27] follow the principles of the word of God
[4:29] so that you can grow thereby you can you
[4:32] can make increase and so the purpose of
[4:35] the Holy Ghost is not to make you a babe
[4:37] in Christ only but to grow you from a
[4:40] babe to
[4:41] manhood and in Christ is the mystery of
[4:43] God excuse me Christ is revealed in his
[4:45] own word brother brandom we read this on
[4:48] Sunday and he's talking about how things
[4:50] have grown from the feet and on up
[4:51] through the body and that he come to the
[4:53] Pentecostal age which is the tongues
[4:54] then you have a prophet that comes and
[4:57] he introduces The Headstone and so the
[4:58] next is the int Ence there's nothing
[5:00] left but for he himself to step into
[5:03] that church and to manifest himself and
[5:05] he said he's governed the body all the
[5:07] way through through the church ages then
[5:10] in the then the complete body of Christ
[5:12] is revealed in the form of a bride that
[5:14] was taken out of his side like Adams was
[5:17] at the beginning so I want to take that
[5:19] image where we are to come out to the
[5:21] complete full maturity full
[5:23] manifestation brother Bram said the full
[5:25] word is to be born into manifestation
[5:27] again at the open of the word which is
[5:28] that third pull the full word is to be
[5:30] born into manifestation it's going to
[5:32] manifest he says in full measure the
[5:34] bride so the bride is this full measure
[5:36] she is to be this fullness the maturing
[5:38] the Capstone uh Union that takes place
[5:41] in this time and he says it's revealed
[5:44] in the bride and he gives us this
[5:46] example as the woman was taken out of
[5:48] Adam that's the image we're to see in
[5:50] this day and we mentioned this on Sunday
[5:52] and I'm using this kind of as our
[5:54] connection point to go further tonight
[5:56] Adam was made he was created a full
[5:59] grown adult he wasn't started out as a
[6:02] molecule or a tadpole and evoluted on up
[6:04] through thousands of years but he was
[6:06] made a man he was first spirit in every
[6:09] way that a man would have a Spirit uh
[6:12] then he is formed in a body and this
[6:14] body is a mature body and then when he
[6:16] takes the woman out of the man he
[6:18] doesn't take forth an embryo he doesn't
[6:21] take an infant or a toddler but he
[6:23] brings forth a full grown adult and they
[6:26] are placed in the garden they are
[6:28] commissioned with the Commandment
[6:30] and they are empowered they're they're
[6:32] not put there to try to figure it out
[6:33] they're not put there to learn and to
[6:35] grow they have been equipped they've
[6:37] been given everything they need all the
[6:39] resources are at their disposal they
[6:41] have power to speak and everything would
[6:43] obey and brother Bram uses a language to
[6:45] say Adam was the most perfect man there
[6:47] has ever been outside of Christ and he
[6:50] would have been the most perfect man
[6:51] there ever was before
[6:53] Christ and so this was a perfect man
[6:55] this was a mature man and so going back
[6:59] to Eden this Eden condition which we
[7:01] know is that third part of the
[7:03] three-fold purpose of Christ it points
[7:06] to it I like to say an adoption
[7:08] experience or an adoption condition or
[7:10] process that when it says the woman's
[7:12] going to come forth as the bride out of
[7:14] Christ in the same way that the woman
[7:16] came out of Adam it's not a baby it's
[7:18] not someone that's learning but someone
[7:20] that comes to that image and that
[7:21] expression of Bride and bridegroom
[7:24] United together with the responsibility
[7:27] the power the responsibility and the
[7:29] capacity the mind of Christ to know what
[7:30] he wants done with the word to fulfill
[7:32] God's word in its season and brother ROM
[7:35] says as Adam and the woman did not
[7:37] fulfill the plan of God Christ through
[7:40] his bride will fulfill all the plan of
[7:42] God even that 1,000 years and that
[7:45] honeymoon so we are to become come into
[7:47] that image of grown fullness
[7:50] manifestation maturity uh along with our
[7:52] bridegroom to fulfill the plan of God in
[7:56] Genesis 1 we'll read verses 26 to3
[8:00] I read this fully aware that we read
[8:03] from Genesis chapters 1 2 and 3 quite a
[8:05] bit and it being the seed chapter it's
[8:08] always a seed book it's nice to go back
[8:10] and see these things in the beginning
[8:12] says God said let us make man in our
[8:15] image this is not an appearance but this
[8:17] is a quality it says after our likeness
[8:20] something internal this is some value
[8:22] system so let's make man in our image
[8:24] and let them have dominion there's your
[8:26] empowering we want to make man a Godlike
[8:29] we want to make him in the image of God
[8:30] and then give him full power full
[8:32] Authority full Reign full government
[8:34] over the fish of the sea over the foul
[8:36] of the air and over the cattle and over
[8:38] all the Earth and over every creeping
[8:40] thing that creepeth upon the Earth
[8:42] that's what God wants to do and just as
[8:44] God does in verse 27 so God created man
[8:47] in his own image and in the image of God
[8:49] created he him male and female created
[8:52] he them so there's this bringing
[8:54] together in that same Covenant that same
[8:55] image the man and the woman and God
[8:58] blessed them and God said send to them
[8:59] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[9:02] the Earth and subdue it and have
[9:04] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[9:06] over the foul of the air and over every
[9:08] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[9:10] so now as he thought it and desired to
[9:13] do it and purpose to make man and give
[9:16] them Dominion he's now doing this this
[9:18] is the placing of man in his position as
[9:21] it'll say in Genesis chapter 2 that when
[9:23] he formed him out of the Dust of the
[9:24] earth he placed the man in the garden to
[9:26] till it so he's there not to learn to
[9:29] till it but to till it he's there not to
[9:32] learn the ways of the garden but to
[9:34] establish those ways because he has been
[9:35] equipped he's been empowered and he can
[9:37] do it he's not necessarily in a learning
[9:40] experience he's he he's he's manifesting
[9:43] he's he's stepped into his office and he
[9:45] says and God said behold I've given you
[9:48] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[9:50] the face of all the Earth and every tree
[9:52] in which is the fruit of the tree
[9:53] yielding seed to you it shall be for
[9:55] meat to every beast of the earth and to
[9:57] every fowl of the air and to everything
[9:59] that creepeth upon the Earth wherein
[10:00] there is life I have given every green
[10:03] herb for meat and it was so Adam upon
[10:06] Earth is God on Earth he is not in an
[10:09] invisible realm he's in this visible
[10:11] realm he has full Authority on Earth and
[10:13] he rules as God and he governs on Earth
[10:16] as God he has jurisdictional control he
[10:20] can control everything he is superior to
[10:23] everything that's on Earth God's not
[10:25] saying Adam if you'll do this you can
[10:28] become he's saying say this is you not
[10:31] if you'll do this then I'll stand behind
[10:33] your word if you'll do that I'll I'll
[10:34] make it so he's saying I've given you
[10:36] everything it's all yours he's handing
[10:39] it to him no strings attached uh in
[10:41] terms of how he can operate that only
[10:43] one condition not one prohibition and if
[10:46] he violated that prohibition he would
[10:48] lose it all and so brother R said God
[10:51] placed over this over this Eden over
[10:53] this creation to rule all his great
[10:56] creation here on Earth his son and his
[10:58] son's bride Adam and Eve they were
[11:01] placed there over all of it and one
[11:04] thing that I think is demonstrated in
[11:07] this scripture and I think to me is
[11:09] apparent in the way that it reads and I
[11:11] think it's something that God wants us
[11:12] to catch that God in the beginning
[11:13] created the Heaven and the earth goes to
[11:15] this process of creation and he makes
[11:18] man and he says let them you have
[11:21] dominion I've given you every herb I've
[11:23] given you every creature I've given you
[11:25] every tree and every fruit and he gives
[11:28] it to him and so God who is the creator
[11:30] of it and the original owner has has
[11:34] given it to Adam and that Adam has
[11:35] inherited God's work and God created it
[11:39] and then he gives it to man for man to
[11:42] operate as his very own right it's
[11:45] something that man then took power and
[11:48] possession over so Adam we could say
[11:50] mankind had a
[11:52] responsibility of furthering God's will
[11:55] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[11:57] Earth God had a vision God had a plan
[11:59] and and God wasn't necessarily going to
[12:00] be the one active in there rolling up
[12:01] his sleeves doing the rest he wanted man
[12:04] and the woman to further God's will they
[12:07] would be like God on Earth bringing
[12:10] forth life establishing the word of God
[12:13] and the Very word son as we make
[12:17] reference to this quite a bit I believe
[12:18] the very word son as a son he is an heir
[12:22] of the father's creation he's the heir
[12:24] of the world he's the heir of Heaven and
[12:25] Earth he was the heir of the father's
[12:27] work and he's made to further God's
[12:30] Vision he is therefore the Builder of
[12:32] God's character he's the Builder the
[12:35] word son in Hebrews the builder of the
[12:37] family name doesn't mean he gets a
[12:39] puzzle with the family name in there
[12:40] he's got building blocks that's got an m
[12:43] and a c and a g and a E and A A and R
[12:45] and A why it's not the it's not that
[12:46] building but he he as he lives expresses
[12:50] what's behind the name and what the
[12:52] power the character the ownership the
[12:54] rights and all the inheritances so
[12:56] that's Adam on Earth as a fully placed
[12:59] son on
[13:00] earth now it being an image and a
[13:04] foreshadowing and God wanting to express
[13:07] something in it there are things that
[13:09] transpire in the garden that were
[13:11] necessary to fulfill God's plan and
[13:14] Satan is used as a tool in that process
[13:17] to further God's perfect will uh and
[13:21] God's plan so Genesis chapter three
[13:23] reveals that Adam loses his position of
[13:26] power his position of authority through
[13:28] the fall
[13:30] I want to point to this knowing that in
[13:32] saying it and I don't know that I guess
[13:34] I could say it's a paradox I don't think
[13:36] it contradicts it's just a paradox but
[13:38] he demonstrates that a son could lose
[13:41] his inheritance based upon
[13:43] Disobedience God gives it to him there
[13:46] is some qualification there is a
[13:48] condition and it's a conditional
[13:50] Covenant it's a it's all yours but don't
[13:52] do this because the day that you do it
[13:54] there's going to be a death and in doing
[13:56] so God had set it forth such that once
[13:59] Satan intervened and got in there Satan
[14:02] wouldn't be able to inherit anything
[14:04] Adam had but if any if Adam was
[14:06] dispossessed it would just go back to
[14:08] God Adam would no longer have possession
[14:10] of it so God had some restrictive
[14:12] covenants in there he had some things
[14:14] that Adam could do but if he didn't do
[14:16] this then it reverted back to the
[14:18] original owner which was God it didn't
[14:21] limit Adam's ability with what he had
[14:23] didn't make him any less of a son didn't
[14:26] make him any less of a of an author
[14:29] Authority but when Adam disobeys and he
[14:31] plays the part of a redeemer himself he
[14:34] loses that inheritance that God had
[14:37] given him and in Genesis 3:15 God
[14:41] promises a redeemer which is Christ and
[14:43] then even from that moment on as you
[14:45] begin to read in the Old Testament you
[14:47] should be looking for Redemption and the
[14:49] law the house of the Lord and all these
[14:51] different things that we could see
[14:53] Genesis 3:15 all foreshadowed Redemption
[14:57] a restoration of what was promised and
[14:59] given to Adam not that Adam himself has
[15:02] to be brought back up and go right to
[15:04] that same location and pick up where he
[15:05] left off but everything it represented
[15:07] everything that man lost everything that
[15:09] mankind was supposed to be Christ comes
[15:12] and demonstrates that everything Adam
[15:14] lost to the fall could be restored to
[15:17] mankind he controlled nature he
[15:19] multiplied creation there's all these
[15:21] things that Christ was doing as the
[15:23] second Adam to show this is a
[15:25] restoration of what had been lost so
[15:27] Redemption is one of those themes that
[15:29] you always look should be looking for in
[15:31] the word of God knowing that God wants
[15:32] to redeem he wants to restore he wants
[15:34] to bring back so he puts forth this
[15:36] picture in Genesis chapter 1 2 and he
[15:39] says this is all the seeds of everything
[15:41] I want to accomplish when man falls in
[15:43] Genesis 3 and the curse is brought in
[15:45] Genesis 4 there's this theme of or is
[15:48] begins to unfold in Genesis 4 and you
[15:49] see the Fallout you there's this theme
[15:52] of God wanting to restore or Redemption
[15:55] which is coming back and finishing God's
[15:58] plan in Leviticus 25: 23 and 24 speaking
[16:03] about the laws of redemption a and the
[16:06] land that has been given to Abraham and
[16:08] his seed they had a very specific
[16:11] inheritance in the promised land they
[16:13] had boundaries they had property they
[16:15] had all sorts of inheritances and there
[16:18] was ways that they could lose it by
[16:20] selling by going into bondage different
[16:22] things that could happen there's even
[16:23] ways where one could marry outside of
[16:25] Israel and that land be inherited by
[16:28] those who weren't Israelites and it was
[16:30] all in the word of God ways that it
[16:33] wouldn't be unfair necessarily to those
[16:35] that possessed it but eventually it was
[16:37] going to go back to the original owner
[16:39] and it speaks about how important an
[16:41] inheritance is to God and we look in the
[16:43] word of God and we find that an
[16:45] inheritance is so precious that if one
[16:47] despises it it's like the worst thing
[16:49] you could do to God Esau is called a
[16:52] profane person because of his attitude
[16:54] towards the inheritance so when God gave
[16:57] adam this great inheritance and he lost
[17:00] it God wants to Signal through the Old
[17:02] Testament to the believer just how
[17:04] important an inheritance is and just how
[17:06] much you should be willing to receive it
[17:08] all and not profane it and not lose it
[17:11] so the Bible says the land shall not be
[17:13] sold forever if someone owned a plot and
[17:17] had been in the family for all these
[17:18] generations and it was by law according
[17:20] to the will of God theirs and they sold
[17:23] it because they got themselves in
[17:24] trouble the word says it cannot be sold
[17:26] forever for the land is mine
[17:30] this is mine I've given it to you as an
[17:31] inheritance if somebody Mars your
[17:34] inheritance I have a process to strike
[17:37] off any Cloud on your title and I want
[17:40] to perfect this title I want to restore
[17:41] it I want to make it clean I want to
[17:43] kick off anybody else who might try to
[17:45] have some sort of claim or adverse
[17:47] possession to this title says for you
[17:49] are strangers and Souljers with me
[17:52] beautiful this land is mine it's not
[17:53] going to be sold forever and in all the
[17:55] land of your possession you shall Grant
[17:57] a Redemption for for the land he's
[18:01] demonstrating as Israel had right title
[18:03] and interest to the land in Israel imp
[18:07] perpetuity and they had absolute title
[18:09] and it was theirs and if something
[18:11] happened where they lost it God wanted
[18:12] the law to say there is going to be a
[18:15] law for the grant of redemption for
[18:17] anything that a individual is
[18:19] dispossessed of because it's mine I own
[18:22] it these are my rules and I want you to
[18:24] have it as an inherit as an heir and so
[18:27] put in the law put in this know that
[18:30] there's going to be Redemption for
[18:32] anything sold that's that should be the
[18:34] image we have even as Adam loses all
[18:37] right title interest and that book from
[18:40] that that title Deed from his hands it
[18:43] goes back to God not in the hands of
[18:44] Satan not in in Adam's keepsake box but
[18:47] he loses it and as soon as he loses it
[18:50] you know that book which was the title
[18:51] deed you know what it becomes the book
[18:53] of redemption because that needs to be
[18:56] redeemed it needs to come back into the
[18:57] hands of man it needs to come that place
[18:59] of full possession again and have full
[19:01] Authority and brother bam uses the
[19:03] language to say when Adam and the woman
[19:05] or Adam and Eve listened to the LIE of
[19:07] the devil the holy image of God left
[19:10] them their Fellowship was broken with
[19:12] God this has been a phrase that I I just
[19:15] personally I'll say I personally have
[19:17] keed in on and think it's very important
[19:18] for me to understand what happened when
[19:20] Adam lost his position and fail is the
[19:24] holy image that Adam was bearing he
[19:27] loses that Holy image image now he's
[19:30] still made in the image of God and after
[19:32] the likeness of God that still there are
[19:34] still these Shadows of Holiness and
[19:37] righteousness in Adam because he came
[19:40] direct from God the woman came direct
[19:43] from God and so as they would have
[19:44] children there would be some nature that
[19:46] they inherited there' be some
[19:48] righteousness it's in the genes it's in
[19:50] the seed and it's only through the
[19:52] mixing and the hybra that Humanity
[19:53] becomes degraded and inherently evil and
[19:57] that's why it's such a great trans
[19:58] transgression what they did and so Adam
[20:01] loses the holy image of God and his
[20:03] fellowship with God is broken and
[20:05] Brotherman says great channels became
[20:07] clogged he couldn't get back to where he
[20:09] was in his mind and in his spirit and
[20:11] you could say that once once innocence
[20:13] is lost it can't be
[20:15] regained and so this image again is not
[20:17] a look but it was his position that was
[20:20] lost this godlikeness this Godly image
[20:24] something is lost in that his Fellowship
[20:27] is impacted and if you look at the very
[20:29] details of it in Genesis chapter 3 Adam
[20:33] who was given everything to control in
[20:35] Genesis 3 saying you're gonna have to
[20:36] fight with it now so the holy image that
[20:39] he loses is the inheritance the power
[20:41] the title deed The Authority you're
[20:43] going to have to fight with nature
[20:44] you're going to have to fight with the
[20:45] ground it's not going to obey you like
[20:47] it once did so Adam made in the image of
[20:49] God loses that image Christ comes in the
[20:52] image of the father showing that that
[20:54] can be restored to Mankind and then it
[20:57] says in Romans 8: 29 for whom he did
[20:59] Forno he also did predestinate to be
[21:02] conformed to the image of his son that
[21:05] he might be the firstborn among many
[21:07] Brethren the image of his son the statue
[21:10] of a perfect man this pattern scripture
[21:12] says that there's a pattern there's
[21:13] works that we are to do the works that I
[21:16] do shall you do also Greater Works that
[21:18] we're to walk in his steps we're to
[21:20] follow in his example so this is Christ
[21:24] that we are to come in the image of and
[21:26] again it's that image of bearing the
[21:28] supernatural bearing the Heavenly the
[21:30] builder of the family name was Christ
[21:33] and now we too are to be conformed
[21:35] conformed means to be fashioned like
[21:37] Christ it's not the same word that's
[21:39] even used in uh be not conformed to this
[21:42] world because that speaks of something
[21:43] temporary something that's just an
[21:45] outline it's just a figure but here
[21:47] we're to be complete and durable not
[21:49] merely a form not merely an outline not
[21:52] something that is just external only
[21:55] where well it looks like it but it's
[21:57] it's just uh smoke mirrors it's just a
[22:00] form and when he says this in verse 29
[22:03] of chapter 8 that we're to be conformed
[22:05] to the image of his son he's drawing
[22:07] from really everything he's been saying
[22:10] from verse one especially if you just
[22:12] look at that chapter and I would like to
[22:14] say that coming to this image of this
[22:16] perfect man is the final product of this
[22:19] adoption process if you look earlier in
[22:21] the chapter as we know the work of the
[22:23] Holy Ghost is to mature the believer he
[22:26] says in verse 18 this is uh leading up
[22:29] to verse 29 he says for I reckon that
[22:31] the sufferings of this present time are
[22:33] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[22:36] which shall be revealed in us this glory
[22:39] is the Perfection of character it's this
[22:41] it's this uprightness it's this
[22:43] manifestation of correct behavior and
[22:46] attit it's to be as one ought to be it's
[22:48] righteousness and he says I reckon that
[22:50] the things that we suffer now in
[22:53] life can never compare to the character
[22:57] that's being formed in us through
[22:59] suffering understand again according to
[23:01] the message of suffering is the process
[23:03] of character development so he's on this
[23:06] subject I reckon as sons of God uh the
[23:08] spirit beared witness with our spirit
[23:10] that we are the sons of God and we
[23:12] reckon that the sufferings of this
[23:14] present time uh um are worth the
[23:16] sufferings because it's producing a
[23:18] glory verse
[23:20] 19 this Glory which is going to be
[23:22] revealed now speaks to this desire of
[23:25] all creation for the earnest expectation
[23:27] of the creature waiteth for the
[23:29] manifestation of the sons of God in the
[23:32] beginning God created the Heaven and
[23:33] Earth brought forth fruit yielding trees
[23:36] and Herb building bearing plants and
[23:38] animal life and he put man on Earth as a
[23:41] manifested Son of God to rule and Reign
[23:44] upon Earth it's yours I've given it to
[23:46] you man loses that so the very ones that
[23:50] were made for the man and they were to
[23:52] be ruled by the man they lost their
[23:54] ruler they lost the ones that they were
[23:57] made to serve the the the grass was to
[23:59] serve the mankind the animal life was to
[24:02] be subservient to mankind all the fruits
[24:05] of the field were were were to come
[24:07] forth and serve their purpose uh for
[24:10] mankind but now that it's lost it's the
[24:12] earnest expectation of Heaven and Earth
[24:15] the creature that God the creation that
[24:17] God created that in it somehow within
[24:20] Mother Nature creation itself it's
[24:22] longing and waiting for the
[24:23] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[24:27] creature was made subject to ity not
[24:28] willingly the creation didn't sin and it
[24:32] was made subject to vanity because of
[24:34] the fall of Man the decision of man and
[24:36] the woman but by reason of him who has
[24:38] subjected the same in hope so now
[24:40] they're still subject to this vanity but
[24:42] there's this hope of what
[24:44] Redemption because the creature itself
[24:46] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[24:49] of corruption remember how the old man
[24:51] is made after this corruption and he he
[24:53] lust and it's at the former conversation
[24:55] of your natural birth and it it comes in
[24:58] sin shapen the wrong way but when you're
[25:00] born again by Incorruptible seed you can
[25:03] now put on the new man and it's this new
[25:05] man these new creatures in Christ that
[25:07] speak to the original intent of the
[25:10] original creation and it has been
[25:12] promised that creation itself shall be
[25:14] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[25:17] the corruption of Fallen flesh the
[25:18] corruption of Satan's plan the
[25:20] corruption of the hybrid nature into
[25:23] what a beautiful phrase the Glorious
[25:25] Liberty of the children of God that one
[25:28] day when it is ruled and Reign Again by
[25:30] these new creation the super race the
[25:32] super people Christ and his bride that
[25:34] that will be
[25:36] Liberty to no longer be in bondage to
[25:39] corruption but loosed into the liberty
[25:41] of children of God and all of creation
[25:42] is groaning for this for we know that
[25:45] the whole creation granth and travaileth
[25:47] in pain together until now for what the
[25:49] manifestation of the sons of God the
[25:50] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[25:52] and not only they but ourselves also
[25:54] which have the first fruits of the
[25:56] spirit even We Grown are we ourselves
[25:59] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[26:02] adoption we that have the spirit we that
[26:06] have been born a new by the baptism of
[26:08] the Holy Ghost are waiting for the
[26:10] adoption Paul did not teach that when he
[26:12] got the Holy Ghost he was a fully
[26:13] adopted Place son now if you want to use
[26:16] the analogy of one who's being a sinner
[26:18] and now made part of the family of God
[26:20] the analogy is fine but recognize that's
[26:22] limited use and even brother brandham
[26:24] uses the phrase of adopted children by
[26:26] Christ to refer to coming out of being
[26:29] just a gentile reprobate Heathen into
[26:31] the family of God but what he's writing
[26:33] now are those who actually possess the
[26:36] indwelling of the spirit are waiting for
[26:39] the adoption he says to it the
[26:41] Redemption of our body the body which
[26:44] came from what the earth the earth which
[26:47] man at one time was made ruler over and
[26:49] did not have to die so adoption is
[26:52] connected with Redemption it's a
[26:55] connected with this image of man and the
[26:57] woman ruling and re on Earth with full
[26:59] power and potential of God likeness and
[27:01] he says for we are saved by hope but
[27:04] hope that is seen is not hope so if Paul
[27:07] was hoping for adoption he wouldn't call
[27:09] it a hope if he saw it for what a man
[27:11] seeth why do he yet hope for it but if
[27:14] we hope for that we see not then do we
[27:16] with patience wait for it now suffering
[27:20] is the process of character development
[27:22] patience is the process of perfection we
[27:25] with patience wait for it let patience
[27:27] have her perfect work that you may be
[27:29] perfect and entire wanting nothing fully
[27:31] matur fully grown up so I reckon that
[27:33] the sufferings I reckon that the process
[27:35] of character development is worth it
[27:38] because it produces character in The
[27:40] Believer and we are waiting and groaning
[27:42] looking forward to full Redemption this
[27:45] adoption and the placing of the body of
[27:47] Christ and all and this is part of this
[27:49] image of the of the manifestation of the
[27:52] sons of God and so what's coming we have
[27:54] a hope being born again to this new hope
[27:57] we wait for this adoption we're looking
[27:59] forward to this Redemption of the body
[28:02] and this patience is the process of
[28:05] maturity and adoption is connected with
[28:07] the manifestation of
[28:10] sons it's pointing to the manifestation
[28:15] of
[28:16] sons and the suffering and the patience
[28:19] is pointing to when the seed presents
[28:23] itself the manifestation of sons the
[28:26] presenting of the fruit the presenting
[28:28] of the fullness the when the when the
[28:30] Harvest has come when the seed has
[28:33] presented itself when the fruit has
[28:34] presented itself maturity completion
[28:37] Perfection that's the manifestation of
[28:39] sons not the birth of sons not the sons
[28:43] coming forth not the manifestation of
[28:45] your election but rather the full
[28:47] potential of what God has looked for
[28:48] from the
[28:49] beginning in the sermon hear ye himym
[28:52] which the dozen or so times that brother
[28:53] Bon preached this it's on the subject of
[28:55] adoption says for when God brought us
[28:57] into his Kingdom by the baptism of the
[28:59] Holy Spirit and become a child of God
[29:02] that's what the baptism of the Holy
[29:03] Ghost is it is the new birth it is the
[29:05] sealing of the soul in the body of
[29:07] Christ it is the guarantee of the
[29:08] Resurrection it is the guarantee of your
[29:10] salvation it cannot be taken away from
[29:12] you says when you have when he's done
[29:14] this God sent us the best tutor that
[29:17] there was in all of Heaven the Holy
[29:20] Spirit and he says he is to nurture and
[29:23] to bring up and to raise and to teach
[29:25] the church brother we need Holy Spirit
[29:28] teaching and tutoring and all of us
[29:30] should say Amen to that there should not
[29:32] be any part of us that says well I'm
[29:34] comfortable with the fact that I've been
[29:36] saved I'm comfortable with the
[29:37] Revelation that I have the message of
[29:38] the hour I know that I'm sealed I know
[29:40] that I'm Justified I know that I'm going
[29:41] in the Rapture and uh and that settles
[29:44] it and have an attitude towards your
[29:47] inheritance of H but he says we need
[29:51] Holy Spirit teaching and tutoring we
[29:53] need to be nurtured to brought up to be
[29:55] raised and to be taught by the Holy G
[29:58] GES we need to Avail ourselves to those
[30:00] resources to those things that God wants
[30:02] to use in our lives for
[30:06] Redemption now in this Ephesians chapter
[30:09] 4 as we've been looking at this there is
[30:11] the speaking the truth and love that we
[30:13] may grow up into him in all things which
[30:16] is the head to the edifying of the body
[30:17] of itself in love this is a language
[30:20] that's connected with adoption to
[30:22] placing the teaching the the bringing
[30:24] out of all the potential of a child of
[30:26] God Ephesians 1: 3 4 5 and 6 it says
[30:32] blessed be the God and father of our
[30:34] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[30:36] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[30:38] places in Christ brother Brenham goes to
[30:41] Great Links to point out that he's
[30:43] writing this to the believer who has the
[30:45] Holy Ghost he's writing this to those
[30:47] who are already seated in Heavenly
[30:48] places in Christ in those who have
[30:50] already been guaranteed a place in the
[30:53] body of Christ or being taught and
[30:55] positionally placed by the holy spirit
[30:57] in that body not just merely entering
[31:00] into the promised land and Crossing
[31:01] Jordan like ah we've here we have
[31:03] arrived but growing and increasing and
[31:06] step by step taking full possession as
[31:08] you spread out and grow and
[31:11] increase so it says in verse four
[31:13] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[31:16] before the foundation of the world that
[31:17] we should be holy and Without Blame
[31:20] before him I'm going to stop there and
[31:24] and and put a period there because the b
[31:27] in in other some other translations and
[31:30] I'm just forgetting now if it's a Blu
[31:31] Letter Bible in some places they
[31:33] actually begin the next sentence with
[31:35] verse 5 in love having predestinated us
[31:38] under the adoption of children so as we
[31:41] are to the truth is to be spoken in love
[31:43] to cause us to grow up into Christ and
[31:46] as we grow up the body is making
[31:48] increase and edifying of itself in love
[31:51] this points back and I don't believe
[31:53] just because it's using in the same
[31:54] phrase and so I don't think you should
[31:56] just Google in love and everything that
[31:58] says in love you just kind of connect it
[32:00] together and AI rewrites a beetle song
[32:03] or something but there's some there's
[32:05] this thought of this in love this is the
[32:07] ultimate purpose this is what God's
[32:09] wanting to do this is the heart purpose
[32:10] of God and it says having predestinated
[32:13] us in love predestinated us destined us
[32:17] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[32:19] Christ to himself amen this adoption of
[32:22] children by Jesus Christ to himself is
[32:25] not the taking of a seed that is not his
[32:28] own in Bur and giving them rights and
[32:31] authority and privileges in a family of
[32:34] God though you're a stranger but rather
[32:36] The Taking of a seed which has been born
[32:38] again and bringing to them a place of
[32:42] establishment and fixing them the
[32:44] predestination unto brother M said
[32:46] speaking of this that speaks to Destiny
[32:48] not your birth but Destiny the adoption
[32:50] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[32:52] according to the good pleasure of his
[32:54] will this is God's will to the praise of
[32:57] the glory of his Grace wherein he ha
[32:58] made us accepted in the Beloved we are
[33:00] accepted in him we are already seated in
[33:03] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are
[33:05] Heirs of God joint HS with Christ we are
[33:08] Sons and Daughters of God and as Sons
[33:10] and Daughters of God he has a perfect
[33:12] will for us he has a good pleasure for
[33:14] his children and so this adoption even
[33:17] in the word that's used it is the
[33:19] establishment and the fixing of
[33:23] children the the development of them the
[33:25] making them not in the bringing them
[33:27] forth but the making of them Jesus
[33:29] Christ was made perfect he was made he
[33:32] became the captain and so this is the
[33:35] placing of sons this is the placing of
[33:37] sons and daughters this is the placing
[33:39] of children and if that phrasing starts
[33:41] to get into maybe some controversial
[33:43] areas it's the growing up of children it
[33:46] is the maturing of
[33:48] children man makes this statement in
[33:50] adoption part two some people mentioned
[33:52] to me that they've been going through
[33:53] this on their own I think it's just
[33:54] beautiful symmetry when we in what God
[33:57] dealing with the CH the the body in God
[34:00] just leads the ministry to encourage you
[34:03] in that I know at one time I might have
[34:05] had the attitude and the idea that well
[34:07] wherever the pastor is preaching you
[34:09] need to get in there and I just believe
[34:10] that a pastor should yield himself
[34:11] enough to be where you need ministering
[34:14] to where you are and not everyone trying
[34:16] to catch up with the pastor so I trust
[34:17] that as we I yield myself I can minister
[34:20] to things that are relevant for you and
[34:22] you pray if you ever feel that I'm uh
[34:24] just beating a dead horse or repeating
[34:26] myself too much like brother Aaron this
[34:27] is just not where we're at this is not
[34:28] where we're at then you pray that God
[34:30] would direct me into those things that
[34:33] you need and don't beat yourself up
[34:35] saying well I guess I just need to feed
[34:37] in the field that Aaron's you know
[34:38] leading in said no no a a as a Shepherd
[34:41] I got to I got to meet your needs so you
[34:43] pray more for me don't beat yourselves
[34:45] up you know you know say what is Aaron
[34:48] right and get me where I need to be so
[34:52] brother says when the father in the Old
[34:54] Testament understood that his son was
[34:55] come of age and he says and had been
[34:58] seasoned out unto adoption now I'm just
[35:01] bringing these things to light entering
[35:04] them into the record as we go forward
[35:06] Lord willing for a few more services on
[35:07] the subject of adoption when he came of
[35:09] age when he grew up to a certain age he
[35:11] had been seasoned out unto adoption this
[35:14] isn't a a past adoption by birth he says
[35:17] they're born a child but they're a son
[35:19] and they're a son right then but they'll
[35:21] never be no more than just a child just
[35:25] an ordinary son until they mature and
[35:27] show what they
[35:30] are it's a presenting of yourself this
[35:33] is who I am this is what I've learned
[35:35] there's things that can be said about
[35:36] the natural development of a child even
[35:39] as we said that neuroplasticity that
[35:40] there's comes a point to where you can't
[35:43] teach a dog old dog new tricks is what
[35:45] they say you can't put new wine in Old
[35:47] bags and whether we're an old dog or an
[35:49] old bag there's something to be said
[35:51] about those who haven't grown and
[35:53] learned that they get so stayed in their
[35:55] ways they can't change and it doesn't
[35:57] mean they're not a son or daughter of
[35:59] God but they do lose something Saul was
[36:03] is was it's spoken in the word of God
[36:05] and we see in the message of the hour
[36:07] that Saul is given a place in Paradise
[36:09] but he loses an inheritance he he he
[36:12] takes the he loses the throne himself
[36:14] and he loses it to Jonathan and his
[36:16] whole family and so there's something
[36:18] man can be a son and daughter of God but
[36:21] they can lose something not trying to be
[36:23] very specific in terms of what you lose
[36:25] I'm like oh you well I don't get to walk
[36:26] on streets of gold and I won't be able
[36:28] to do this I won't I don't think it's
[36:29] necessarily important to try to figure
[36:30] out just exactly what tier you're at in
[36:33] God's Rewards program how do I log in
[36:35] how do I see where I'm at but am I a
[36:37] million Miler yet it's not necessary to
[36:39] try to how can I lock this in I need to
[36:41] use up my points before I lose them it's
[36:43] not that it's just the it's the
[36:45] understanding that there is a fullness
[36:47] there's
[36:48] 100% And there's a measure in you and
[36:51] you want to meet that measure you want
[36:53] to meet that measure and he says until
[36:55] they mature and show what they are this
[36:57] is is who I am the manifestation of sons
[37:00] he says then they're just a child
[37:02] they're just an ordinary son they don't
[37:03] inherit that's what his consistent
[37:05] teaching in this is is that they got to
[37:07] come at age and notice he says seasoned
[37:10] out into adoption and he uses a language
[37:12] they must mature and show what they are
[37:14] says in another place now this child was
[37:16] obedient and there came a certain day
[37:19] when this child became
[37:21] matured so its maturity is what's an
[37:23] issue it's not birth it's not works I I
[37:28] it's not external things it's not
[37:30] pretense it's not the Optics but it's
[37:32] maturity it's character it's thought
[37:34] process it's discipline it's obedience
[37:37] it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when
[37:39] the child had become matur he'd listen
[37:41] to the tutor he's coming into the
[37:43] father's image chip off the old block
[37:45] you can't do that without the Holy Ghost
[37:48] you can't do that without the nature of
[37:49] the father so there is a disobedient son
[37:52] which is dispossessed which doesn't get
[37:53] his inheritance that brother bam says he
[37:55] needs adoption but he's not mature
[37:57] enough to be adopted but the son on the
[37:59] other hand when he changes the picture
[38:00] he is a son he has the Holy Ghost he
[38:02] believes every word he has every
[38:04] evidence of the Holy Ghost in his life
[38:05] and brother man says he matures out to a
[38:07] particular place that was the father's
[38:09] will it's what he intended all
[38:11] along and it's then that that child when
[38:13] he's seasoned out that they mature and
[38:15] they show what they are that he stands
[38:17] to receive what the father intended for
[38:19] him all along the fullness the fullness
[38:21] of The
[38:23] Inheritance I'm leaving some scriptures
[38:25] out in this and just a few principles
[38:28] and uh we maybe we'll pick up on it on
[38:30] Sunday but I want to read a very lengthy
[38:32] statement from the sermon you must be
[38:34] born again in it is New Year's Eve in
[38:37] 1961 excuse it's New Year's Day it's
[38:40] that morning New Year's Eve that morning
[38:42] in 1961 and he says
[38:45] shortcuts and he's referring to
[38:47] shortcuts it's a lengthy reading but
[38:49] we're going to
[38:50] um I think I'm ending on this let me
[38:53] just check before I missp
[38:55] speake that's a very it's a very lengthy
[38:58] statement there's a lot still to share
[39:00] yet in this but just listen and hold
[39:02] tight to this
[39:03] whole
[39:05] uh this large section of this sermon and
[39:08] you'll recognize some statements that
[39:09] that we've already made recently but I
[39:11] want I want this to be in your hearts I
[39:13] I want you to catch a hold of this
[39:15] because can be important as the Lord
[39:16] deals with your heart individually we
[39:18] come together collectively as a body
[39:20] then on Sunday when the whole house of
[39:21] God is full and maybe there's a lot of
[39:23] people here who haven't heard this it's
[39:24] in your heart it's in your understanding
[39:26] there's this respon the word of God that
[39:28] can say amen and we can create the right
[39:30] kind of atmosphere so the Holy Spirit
[39:32] can deal with Souls create the right
[39:34] kind of Atmosphere for births for
[39:35] correction and for these things he says
[39:38] shortcuts tonight they're out here today
[39:41] and they're going on and tomorrow they
[39:42] want to preach so he come up you know
[39:45] something happens tonight wo big brew
[39:46] HaHa and then tomorrow they're just you
[39:49] know they're ready to preach ready to
[39:50] Pastor he says Pentecostal people
[39:52] letting them do that
[39:53] too they want a shortcut to Heaven
[39:56] Hallelujah all I have to do is get down
[39:58] here and just don't think nothing of it
[40:00] at all and say hallelujah hallelujah I
[40:01] got Elijah's garment I'm going out
[40:03] tomorrow cast out Devils hallelujah
[40:05] hallelujah I got it praise God here I go
[40:08] he goes they want the shortcut to Heaven
[40:11] taking as much of the world as they can
[40:13] you can't take any of it there's no
[40:17] shortcuts you come the way of Calvary
[40:20] you come the way of the brass altar you
[40:22] come the way of the Brazen serpent you
[40:24] die you actually die oh God why can't I
[40:26] say it right you die literally die to
[40:28] yourselves die to the things of the
[40:30] world and are born a new amen no world
[40:33] the things of the world are dead so it's
[40:35] a it's a you die to yourself it's a a
[40:38] figurative death it's a dying to the
[40:41] things of the Lord you're born a new
[40:42] there's your new birth there's no
[40:43] shortcuts youve got to be born again and
[40:45] then he says again there's no shortcuts
[40:47] he's just continued on the same line
[40:49] they want to come right
[40:51] quick they don't want to grow and I
[40:54] believe that there is a a chronology to
[40:57] this where brother says so many people
[40:58] want a shortcut and they want to claim
[41:00] that they're Sons and Daughters of God
[41:01] because they had some kind of Hallelujah
[41:03] Hallelujah fit and he says NOP you got
[41:05] to come the same way you got to come
[41:07] through Calvary you got to be born again
[41:09] and then he repeats there's no shortcuts
[41:11] they want to come right quick they don't
[41:13] want to grow so I believe that this is
[41:15] even instruction this is instruction to
[41:17] those who have been born again that's
[41:19] not a microwave
[41:21] process he says they want to come right
[41:23] quick they don't want to grow we grow in
[41:25] the Lord it takes growth and
[41:27] experience you remember I referenced
[41:29] years ago brother Lonnie's revenge and
[41:32] it was this uh it was based upon my
[41:34] retelling of a testimony at a men's
[41:36] meeting where such beautiful instruction
[41:38] was going forth and I was taking just a
[41:40] a devotion I was like man just think if
[41:42] we could really put into practice what
[41:44] we've learned here just how much better
[41:46] the men's meeting can be in six months
[41:47] when we get there and brother Lonnie's
[41:49] Revenge was not brother Michael Jenkins
[41:51] but rather it was him getting up there
[41:52] and say yeah whatever that young buck
[41:54] was saying last night this is a marathon
[41:56] not a Sprint and in 6 months you're
[41:58] probably not going to be much further
[42:00] than where you are now and I'm kind of
[42:02] going okay well all
[42:05] right and uh and I got corrected right
[42:08] and I didn't huff and puff and quit and
[42:10] I went to every single men's meeting
[42:12] after that until there was just a little
[42:14] bit of a break and then I just came to
[42:15] the position where I felt like I didn't
[42:16] need him anymore no I'm just kidding
[42:19] they're always on our anniversary like
[42:21] this week I should be in Jackson Wyoming
[42:22] looking for church parcels and but just
[42:26] not just didn't work this year because
[42:28] of our schedules but
[42:30] still that's why I don't go to men's
[42:32] meetings really but that being said
[42:34] brother Lonnie's Revenge was which would
[42:36] make a great cover band for message
[42:40] music that's what the mistake was
[42:43] thinking we're going to be so much
[42:44] further down the road oh this is going
[42:45] to have it's a marathon it's long term
[42:48] takes growth and experience people are
[42:51] told out on the west coast now oh we got
[42:53] the immortal baptism we baptize you in
[42:56] water you turn right back to a young man
[42:57] right there a young woman yes sir you
[42:59] keep getting they got Elijah's garments
[43:01] they got manifested Sons what is that
[43:02] they got adopted Sons they got fully
[43:04] placed adopted Sons is what that means
[43:06] yes sir brother God's getting manifested
[43:08] Sons right now manifested tell them all
[43:09] about this tonight you're a sinner
[43:11] tomorrow you're a manifested sons of
[43:13] God tonight you could be a sinner
[43:16] tomorrow you could be a born- again Son
[43:17] of God but a fully adopted placed Son of
[43:20] God according to scripture 20 the
[43:21] teaching of the messenger of the hour he
[43:23] says nonsense where do you get that in
[43:26] the word babies are not born men they're
[43:28] born babies and grow to
[43:30] men Boys to Men might have made a good
[43:32] title for this brother brah then quotes
[43:35] from Ephesians chap 4: 11- 15 he's
[43:38] quoting through this he's saying grow up
[43:39] into what into him so he's taking
[43:41] Ephesians 4 it's at the heart the center
[43:43] of what he's teaching there are no
[43:45] shortcuts God has a pro a a process of
[43:49] being born again nurtured taught growing
[43:51] up maturing seasoned out and then he
[43:55] tells this story I remember the first
[43:57] sermon I preached I got there and I
[43:59] thought I did real well and all the old
[44:01] ladies sat around and they cried a
[44:03] little bit you know and said oh what a
[44:05] wonderful boy the old Pastor Dr Davis
[44:08] was an old lawyer I went down and he
[44:10] said I want to see you down at the house
[44:12] I said all right I walked in the next
[44:14] day you know all swelled out I said
[44:16] how'd I do Dr Davis he said the
[44:18] rottenest I ever heard I said what he
[44:22] said the worst I ever heard oh I said
[44:25] Brother Davis everybody was
[44:27] crying he said yes they cry at funerals
[44:31] they cry at births everything else he
[44:33] said what is it Billy you never quoted
[44:35] one bit of God's word you talked about
[44:38] some mother that done gone on or
[44:40] something like this and got everybody to
[44:41] crying what is it pulling on the
[44:43] emotions saying things that only
[44:45] identify with the Flesh and spirit of
[44:47] man but not a word that can identify
[44:50] with the germ seed in the soul of a
[44:52] person he says you got everybody crying
[44:54] he said you're not born again upon those
[44:56] things and sensations of this Earth
[44:59] you're born by the word oh he cut the
[45:02] wind out of me I'm glad he
[45:04] did Brother Bram said not jumping up and
[45:07] down hollering that isn't it it's the
[45:09] word that makes alive the words Quicken
[45:12] not experiences the
[45:14] word so now think that this is you must
[45:16] be born again this is dealing with no
[45:19] shortcuts he's dealing with the process
[45:21] of God to grow up into him when youngans
[45:24] babes toddlers adolescen teenagers in
[45:26] Christ grow up to their full po
[45:28] potential and they show what they really
[45:30] are they leave nothing they they they
[45:33] leave no promise unfulfilled that God
[45:36] the potential in their life so think
[45:38] evidence think proof think uh fruit
[45:41] because brother B's going to come to
[45:42] that and he continue on the story with
[45:44] Dr Davis he brother bram's words it's
[45:46] not jumping and down it's not hollering
[45:47] it's the word that makes alive he said I
[45:50] remember the first case I tried Billy I
[45:53] beat on the rail I said look at this
[45:56] poor woman look how she looked and her
[45:57] husbands mistreated her I cried a little
[46:00] and picked up my handkerchief and acted
[46:01] just like the rest of the lawyers I
[46:04] thought I'd go through the same emotion
[46:05] judge your honor why don't you give her
[46:07] back give her a divorce look at her she
[46:09] says her husband beat her back across
[46:11] the back he couldn't even see it
[46:12] underneath her clothes they beat her
[46:14] across the back why don't you give her
[46:17] the old judge just sat there and looked
[46:19] so just think of the
[46:21] theatrics first this young attorney he's
[46:24] up there and he's just uh boy and he's
[46:27] all emotional he says directly the old
[46:30] attorney s in Crossing this side had
[46:32] growed up so here's the Young attorney
[46:36] here's the grownup he said judge your
[46:38] honor how much more of this nonsense
[46:39] will your court
[46:41] stand just a lot of carrying on this is
[46:43] Brother bram's assessment now just a lot
[46:45] of carrying on that's the way too many
[46:47] people do too much carrying on without
[46:50] enough word behind it to back it up grow
[46:53] up oh he danced in the spirit last night
[46:56] brother br he's all right no that don't
[46:58] make him all right to me no sir he's got
[47:01] to grow up be proved tested growing up
[47:03] to him
[47:05] seasoned seasoned out into adoption is
[47:07] how the phrasing he uses he says that
[47:09] don't make him all right to me now that
[47:11] doesn't make dancing in spirit all
[47:14] wrong it just doesn't make the person
[47:17] all
[47:18] right and we know as the song goes Jesus
[47:21] is just all right with me but dancing
[47:23] may be all right but it doesn't make the
[47:25] person all right got we don't have one
[47:27] problem with dancing we don't have one
[47:28] problem being slain in the spirit we
[47:30] don't have a problem with these things
[47:31] that are in order and things are done
[47:33] and the holy spirit moves that's what
[47:34] the Holy Spirit can do it stimulates the
[47:36] believer it causes these things to
[47:37] happen but it doesn't make the believer
[47:39] all right he's got to grow up brother
[47:42] brandham said there got to be enough
[47:44] word behind it to back it up what are
[47:47] all of our meetings and all of our
[47:49] theatrics and all our body exercise in
[47:51] the producing of some fantastic if
[47:53] there's not enough rightly dividing of
[47:55] the word of God to back it up and caus
[47:57] the young to grow
[48:00] up got to grow up be proved tested
[48:02] growing up to him there's your Ephesians
[48:04] 4
[48:06] seasoned then brother bam takes a very
[48:08] interesting path over the next several
[48:09] paragraphs and begins to talk about the
[48:11] history of the church and how Devils
[48:13] would present themselves to these uh
[48:15] these Messengers and the Devils attempts
[48:17] to deceive through this Supernatural he
[48:20] says oh that would have been a real hook
[48:21] to a Pentecostal in one telling says
[48:23] that would have been Pentecostal bait
[48:24] for sure why if you've got that kind of
[48:26] immature mindset you're gravitate to
[48:29] these external flashy things and you
[48:33] tell yourself yeah this is it right here
[48:35] he said that would have been a a a real
[48:38] test to an immature believer he said but
[48:41] these men of God they knew right where
[48:42] they stood they knew where the word was
[48:44] he says this about Satan how he comes in
[48:46] and just makes it so beautiful oh they
[48:49] spoke in tongues of the best people you
[48:50] ever seen don't you believe that are you
[48:55] listening be lyc
[48:59] he's
[49:00] actually I mean it's very interesting
[49:03] brother Brown would be teaching this to
[49:04] his church or to the church to say no be
[49:06] be a little cautious with that if
[49:08] somebody's emphasizing these fleshly
[49:11] things emphasizing the tongues and
[49:13] emphasizing certain emotions he
[49:15] says he's not saying speak against it be
[49:18] negative he says but kind of be
[49:20] leery just be cautious a little
[49:23] bit do you understand what he's saying
[49:25] there that we can't take that kind of
[49:28] emphasis and that kind of presentation
[49:31] and just buy it say be a little leer
[49:34] because then you want to watch where it
[49:36] leads Watch what it does in a person's
[49:38] life somebody says oh I danced I shouted
[49:41] we had a wonderful time it was a
[49:42] beautiful campas this that and the other
[49:44] you watch the person's life that's right
[49:48] and and and that's going to be the real
[49:49] proof of what they experienced and he
[49:52] says this is immediately he says don't
[49:55] you believe that be lary I hope the
[49:58] word's not boring you it's my new
[50:01] favorite
[50:03] quote he said I hope the word's not
[50:05] boring you you know how some Churches
[50:07] say be still and know that I am the Lord
[50:08] we should just have that as like the
[50:11] tagline above me and this is probably my
[50:14] my uh my friends are really going to
[50:15] love me saying that at least he's
[50:17] self-aware I hope the word's not boring
[50:20] you to me it was just it's beautiful
[50:22] poetry for him to just come right out
[50:24] and say yeah I know what you might want
[50:26] want is to be
[50:28] entertained I know what you might want
[50:30] is for me to just kind of pump you up a
[50:32] little bit and to produce the kind of
[50:34] atmosphere where we can let loose a
[50:36] little bit and feel really good about
[50:37] ourselves and nothing wrong with that
[50:39] but he acknowledges that maybe there's
[50:41] just a little bit of a bent in the
[50:43] people to where just good solid gospel
[50:46] teaching might bore them and when they
[50:49] want their ears
[50:50] itched they're not getting it he's like
[50:53] I hope the words not boring you and he
[50:56] says born born Christians grow into the
[51:00] stature of Christ as they
[51:02] live they're born again and their lives
[51:05] begin to shape like a baby takes form
[51:08] and begins to grow first you know here
[51:10] they are in the full stature amen there
[51:13] you are day after day year after year
[51:16] they stay the same now come back to the
[51:19] word if you abide in me yeah people year
[51:21] after year day after day if we're to try
[51:23] to just get our heads around what he's
[51:25] trying to say there's some people that
[51:26] always stay the same are they in the
[51:27] pattern are they
[51:29] growing but when we're born again our
[51:31] lives begin to take shape it forms and
[51:33] begins to grow to come to full stature
[51:36] they say I got born again Hallelujah I
[51:38] joined the I joined this I joined I
[51:41] don't know last year I believed in Jesus
[51:42] name now I backed it out backed out now
[51:44] I believe that I this and I believe that
[51:46] you had to be holy but just so and so
[51:48] said well just a tantrum right it's kind
[51:51] of those waves it's the tossing to and
[51:54] fro you watch certain things that aren't
[51:56] brightly divid in the word of truth
[51:57] there's always these extremes Bend all
[52:00] the way on this side this is what we
[52:01] believe now and then we go all the way
[52:02] this is what we believe now and it's
[52:03] just always this tossing to and fro
[52:05] brother says wanders tossed about with
[52:07] every wind of Doctrine children my words
[52:11] the wanderings tossed about he's quoting
[52:13] from Ephesians 4 they're children but
[52:16] we're to grow up to not be children
[52:18] anymore not I join this I join that I
[52:20] believe this I backed out I believe this
[52:22] I had to do this but so and so said and
[52:23] there's always quoting so and so right
[52:25] brother so and so brother so and so but
[52:26] it's it's not back to the word he says
[52:28] but be born to the spirit and grow into
[52:32] the stature of Christ growing into the
[52:35] stature of Christ through your life
[52:38] proves like if you're born to Prophet
[52:41] you'll remain that if you're born to
[52:42] chrisan You'll remain that if you abide
[52:44] in me and my words abide in you this
[52:46] grows you up into the stature of Christ
[52:50] not some young lawyer beating screaming
[52:53] crying telling you this that and the
[52:54] other and make a lot of emotions if we
[52:57] don't do I hope the word's not boring
[52:58] you we could do this not some young
[53:01] lawyer beating screaming crying telling
[53:02] you this that and the other make a lot
[53:03] of emotions not some kid in the swimming
[53:06] pool just splashing out a bunch of water
[53:07] right someone who knows how to make
[53:09] progress in the water but somebody who's
[53:12] grown into the stature of Christ through
[53:14] the years has been seasoned out and
[53:16] proven standing at the
[53:18] helm no other Rock he says on Christ the
[53:21] solid rock we stand on all the ground is
[53:23] sinking sand let denominations and
[53:25] Creeds come go and go let isms keep me
[53:28] humble Lord stay right with the word and
[53:29] move right on through the stream she

[53:34] statment now look if we see how it turns
[53:37] out here and you can't change after
[53:39] death so there's your character death
[53:42] isn't going to process a renewing of
[53:45] your mind it's just a change of Dwelling
[53:46] Place he say now you watch these people
[53:48] that come in gets all the sensations and
[53:50] things and runs out and tomorrow they're

[54:28] Christian you might be hated of the
[54:30] world if you do it's because something
[54:31] you've done you should be but if you're
[54:33] hated for his sake that's
[54:36] different if all the things he says
[54:39] about the jumping up and down and the
[54:40] hollering and the sensations and
[54:42] speaking in tongues and the Hallelujah
[54:43] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the

[55:18] born again 26 years ago and I don't feel
[55:20] that I'm much further down the road now
[55:21] than I ever was before then I just say
[55:24] yeah about time you start growing I I'm

[55:31] the Holy Ghost grow grow up yes start
[55:36] growing up get out of these cycles and
[55:39] these isms and
[55:40] things brother man continues just
[55:43] skipping a little bit he says when
[55:44] you're born again God vindicates you
[55:46] that's how God vindicates all his Nature
[55:47] by their fruits that's the way he
[55:50] vindicates his ministry all his servants
[55:52] are Vindicated the same way he
[55:54] vindicates nature
[55:56] it's not so much a the external
[56:00] expression of the fruits of the spirit
[56:03] but the fruit of the gift of the spirit
[56:06] the fruit of the spirit it's not so much
[56:09] uh an outward impersonation but an
[56:11] inward demonstration inward possession
[56:13] brother B teaches on that in a number of
[56:15] different places and so he says he
[56:17] vindicates it by Nature how do you know
[56:19] it's a peach tree how do you
[56:22] know is it scratch and
[56:25] sniff he says cuz it brings peaches how
[56:28] do you know it's an apple tree bearing
[56:30] apples how do you know it's a Christian
[56:33] Christian signs bear from it Christian
[56:36] Life comes out of it now remember when
[56:38] he says oh they spoke in tongues he says
[56:41] be Larry he says I hope the word's not
[56:44] boring you why because maybe it's going
[56:46] to take a little bit of pressing in to
[56:49] understand what he means when he can say
[56:50] Your Life Christian signs will bear from
[56:52] it and he's not necessarily saying
[56:55] laying hands on the sick and speaking in
[56:57] tongues and dancing and shouting he's
[56:59] speaking to a life of value of character
[57:02] Christ's life comes from it how do you
[57:03] know he's a teacher the word comes from
[57:05] how do you know he's a prophet the word
[57:06] comes through him Bears record
[57:08] Vindication it proves itself how does it
[57:09] become that when it dies and becomes one
[57:13] that's right when we die and become a
[57:14] new creature in Christ it gets us with
[57:17] our calling we stay with our calling the
[57:19] fruits of the spirit follow us when we
[57:21] are his servants when we're born again
[57:23] the fruits of Christ life follow us how
[57:26] do you know it's a peach tree I actually
[57:27] went back and was like wait a minute
[57:28] copy and past and right on top of each
[57:30] other no he says how do you know it's a
[57:31] peach tree it's got
[57:33] peaches how do you know he's a Christian
[57:35] he acts like Christ he walks like Christ
[57:37] he talks like Christ he lives like
[57:40] Christ above sin
[57:43] Victorious that's it's high
[57:47] standards he loves his wife like Christ
[57:50] loves the church high standards she
[57:54] reverence her her reverences her husband
[57:55] as the church does Christ high
[57:59] standards what does he do say see what I
[58:02] done Christ didn't do that soce the
[58:04] attitude the character the humility he
[58:05] gave all praise to the father that's
[58:07] right that's how you know it by their
[58:09] fruits you shall know them he says
[58:11] verily verely I say you except a man be
[58:13] born again he cannot even
[58:15] understand the kingdom of
[58:18] God I hope that paints a picture for you
[58:22] of what God means when he says we got to
[58:24] grow up
[58:27] and in my emphasis I acknowledge that
[58:29] even tonight there may be a lot of
[58:31] emphasis to say the screaming the
[58:33] shouting the dancing the hauling the
[58:34] speaking in tongues and all these things
[58:37] are are could be distractions or red
[58:41] herrings or things that we try to put
[58:43] way too much weight and emphasis on at
[58:45] the expense of our development our
[58:48] growth but I don't want I don't want my
[58:51] emphasis to be so one-sided or you to go
[58:54] too far with my emphasis to turn these
[58:56] things into a bad thing but I want you
[58:58] to understand it's part of our growth as
[58:59] a Christian it's part of our experience
[59:02] I'm glad that when I begin to serve the
[59:04] Lord there was so much there's
[59:06] Supernatural things happening and there
[59:07] was a lot of weeping a lot of crying
[59:09] there was more shouting there was more
[59:10] enthusiasm there was these things that
[59:12] took place early on in my development
[59:14] that are still with me today still a
[59:16] part of who I am I and and they've made
[59:20] me what I am and it it's given me
[59:22] perspective and it it helped establish
[59:23] me in faith to believe God and then to
[59:25] take them at his word and and and it was
[59:28] God just pouring out his love upon me
[59:30] getting my attention and I trust that as
[59:32] my faith has grown in my love has grown
[59:35] that I don't have to lean into that as
[59:37] much as I can just his
[59:39] word and sense his presence and
[59:41] surrender myself in ways to where he can
[59:44] truly use me and grow and develop in
[59:46] other areas that maybe I couldn't then
[59:48] and I was enjoying a certain season and
[59:50] experiencing different things and now
[59:52] what I want is I want to become more
[59:53] like Christ I want to walk with Christ I
[59:55] want to talk like Christ I want to live
[59:57] like Christ I want to be victorious over
[1:00:00] sin and so I trust that you can see that
[1:00:02] there is this pattern of these things
[1:00:04] working together and if you're a young
[1:00:06] person if you're young in spirit if you
[1:00:08] enjoy these certain things by way of
[1:00:10] Personality or or or or or nurture
[1:00:12] nature then those things are wonderful
[1:00:15] they're fine but what we emphasize and
[1:00:17] what we want to see is the word of God
[1:00:20] that it's not boring us but it's shaping
[1:00:23] us because in everything that we get
[1:00:26] let maybe could just say that it's fine
[1:00:28] to have a lot of carrying on but we need
[1:00:30] enough word behind it to back it up so
[1:00:33] that we can grow
[1:00:36] up amen God bless you tonight I'd like
[1:00:39] to pray with you so if you could stand
