[0:00] I'm G I want to try to finish our
[0:02] thought on the big three today and today
[0:05] we're going to be focusing specifically
[0:07] on the pride of life and popularity the
[0:11] pride of life is that coveting after
[0:12] honor or Applause uh the pride of life
[0:15] and popularity is kind of being hungry
[0:17] for um or needy for
[0:20] acceptance and we're taking that phrase
[0:22] The Big Three from John where it says
[0:25] all that is in the world the lust of the
[0:26] eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[0:28] of life is of the world it's not of the
[0:31] father but is of the world and when it
[0:34] comes to the big three those thingss
[0:36] we're kind of running them um in line
[0:38] with money women and popularity lust of
[0:40] the flesh is money the lust of the eye
[0:43] um corresponds to women pride of life to
[0:46] popularity and we've been looking at the
[0:49] running greedily after the ER of balum
[0:51] for reward which is the money the lust
[0:53] of the Flesh and the way of Cain which
[0:55] we see in the lust of the eye in women
[0:57] and then we'll be looking at the gain
[0:58] saying of Kora that relates to the
[1:00] popularity and the pride of life so I
[1:03] know there's a lot of layers to this
[1:04] cake but I hope you enjoy it while you
[1:06] eat it and we made a point Wednesday
[1:09] night that in when it comes to those
[1:11] things and we use the big three just to
[1:12] be able to refer to it um collectively
[1:14] very quickly the only thing that gives
[1:17] you absolute power over them is faith in
[1:20] the word of God if you don't have faith
[1:22] in the word of God then you're
[1:24] absolutely subject to the big three but
[1:27] by faith in the word of God you can have
[1:30] absolute power over these things I'd
[1:33] like to uh since we're wrapping up the
[1:35] subject of the big three Lord will and
[1:37] I'd like just to give a quick review of
[1:40] the first two the lust of the flesh we
[1:42] could see that scripturally it relates
[1:45] to the things related to the body see
[1:47] taste feel smell and hear uh to run
[1:50] greedily after reward uh that was the
[1:52] heir of balum who denied the word of God
[1:55] for money and he was very subtle in the
[1:58] way that he did it the way that he
[1:59] approached it he seems to be maybe a
[2:01] sympathetic character or appeared to be
[2:03] someone who's very honorable but his he
[2:06] um he was fostering these certain
[2:07] affections in his heart and he was
[2:09] satisfied he satisfied his covetousness
[2:12] he satisfied his longing uh for money at
[2:15] any expense even if that meant he caused
[2:18] Israel to stumble even if that meant he
[2:20] contradicted the word of the Lord and so
[2:23] baalam was acting solely to please his
[2:26] flesh to please the blood and his flesh
[2:29] and blood and solely for financial gain
[2:33] with the lust of the eyes that relates
[2:34] to the mind it's that emotional and
[2:36] intellectual part of the human being
[2:38] It's associated with the way of Cain
[2:40] wherein he had this rebellion and
[2:42] refusal to submit to the word of God and
[2:44] he was using the Optics to satisfy
[2:47] himself and using pretense as a way of
[2:49] uh thinking that he was right in other
[2:51] words in looking at we could say that he
[2:53] silence the voice of the word uh because
[2:56] he was satisfied with the outward
[2:57] display he was concerned uh about the
[3:00] outward display and it was related to
[3:03] beauty and we saw that in the Temptation
[3:05] in the garden where the woman saw that
[3:07] the tree was good for food and then she
[3:09] saw it Pleasant to the eyes and we see
[3:10] it with Christ turn the stones made to
[3:12] bread and also see these kingdoms Bow
[3:15] Down and Worship me so we see those
[3:17] things running together now in the pride
[3:20] of life I'd like to point out this part
[3:23] that as I studied this as I saw things
[3:25] related to the body and then to the
[3:28] Spirit uh there's this connection C of
[3:30] the pride of life to the soul write down
[3:31] where the man really is what he is as a
[3:34] person and when we are given to the
[3:37] pride of life we are driven by pride and
[3:40] that pride is fed by doubt it's not fed
[3:42] by faith it's not fed by the word but
[3:44] it's fed by doubt insecurity things that
[3:47] relate to Pride and in the gainsaying of
[3:50] cores we'll look in Greater detail today
[3:52] they rejected the prophet they rejected
[3:53] the word uh because they wanted a part
[3:56] or they wanted a role they wanted to be
[3:58] equal with the prophet so the pride of
[4:01] life is that Desiring recognition that
[4:03] coveting after praise we use the
[4:05] Pharisees as an example showing off uh
[4:07] for the sake of acceptance or to be
[4:09] perceived as right that's that Pharisee
[4:11] Spirit Satan tempted Jesus to this when
[4:14] he said jump God will save you what
[4:16] would that be doing showing off God said
[4:18] if I jump off a building or God said if
[4:20] I he wouldn't allow me to be harm so
[4:22] I'll just jump off this
[4:23] building right sometimes we say I know
[4:26] this is what God wants me to do so
[4:27] nothing's going to stop me nothing's
[4:29] going to keep me from it and so there's
[4:31] this uh maybe there's this fine line
[4:33] between uh faith and showing off where
[4:36] if your heart's not right your motive is
[4:38] not right you're not approaching it the
[4:39] right way then you're just trying to
[4:41] self fulfill the word of God and show
[4:43] off that he's going to back you up and
[4:44] become sort of showman or or or display
[4:47] something for the purpose of pretense
[4:49] and to the woman when she saw that the
[4:51] tree was to be desired to make one wise
[4:53] to become Godlike she wanted to become
[4:56] like God but not the god of the
[4:58] scripture or the true God but this
[4:59] perverted characterization of God so the
[5:03] soul or we could say it's the heart body
[5:05] spirit and heart or the soul of man
[5:07] that's the source of Pride we know
[5:10] according to the message of the hour
[5:12] that in the soul there exist um a dove
[5:14] nature or a serpent nature when you're
[5:15] born again the serpent nature is uh is
[5:18] done away with it's cast out it dies and
[5:20] so there's these two senses that govern
[5:23] someone who's not born again it's this
[5:24] believing or doubt and so faith and
[5:27] doubt you have the sense of Faith or
[5:29] doubt and I would say pride is the
[5:31] weakness for everyone who does not have
[5:33] the Holy Ghost pride is the weakness for
[5:35] anyone without a new birth because it's
[5:38] fed by doubt pride is fed by doubt and
[5:40] so where that pride is um it it has this
[5:43] ability to kind of lift up the Flesh in
[5:45] ways that we don't quite uh maybe think
[5:47] of being lifted up but I believe a lot
[5:49] of times things that appear to be
[5:51] humility are false humility because of
[5:53] Pride there's people who don't want you
[5:55] to do something for oh please don't do
[5:56] that for me no I don't want it don't do
[5:57] this don't do that and they refuse to
[5:59] have anything done for them and you
[6:00] think wow they're they're pretty humble
[6:02] they just don't ever want anyone to do
[6:03] something for them well look at that
[6:05] from a different perspective it could be
[6:08] Pride they're not willing to Humble
[6:10] themselves and just let somebody else do
[6:11] something for them and it's not
[6:13] necessarily rooted in an arrogance but
[6:15] it's rooted in a complex it's rooted in
[6:17] some sort of self-perception or fear of
[6:20] how they're going to be perceived by
[6:21] others and in Psalm 244 it says he that
[6:25] hath Clean Hands these are the ones that
[6:26] will not be on that Holy Mountain or um
[6:29] who will be there he says he that hath
[6:31] Clean Hands and a pure heart who ha not
[6:34] lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn
[6:37] deceitfully I know there's a lot
[6:39] captured there but a pure heart in one
[6:41] who has not lifted up his soul
[6:43] pridefully he's not lifted it up in
[6:45] vanity so it's from that soul for where
[6:47] a what a man really
[6:49] is uh and who he is his character and
[6:51] what he is deep down in his heart when
[6:53] he has lifted up his soul in Pride and
[6:56] with vanity or showing off somebody who
[6:58] doesn't do that would be an heir to this
[7:01] mountain to be the kingdom in habac
[7:05] 2:4 and I apologize if I'm going kind of
[7:08] fast this morning I'm wanting just to
[7:10] show how pride is related to that that
[7:12] heart of a man behold his soul which is
[7:14] lifted up is not upright in him but the
[7:17] just shall live by his faith so the soul
[7:20] that is lifted up is not pleasing to the
[7:22] Lord a soul that is prideful a soul that
[7:24] is arrogant a soul that is showing off
[7:27] is not upright in him that is not pure
[7:29] in heart he says but the just shall live
[7:31] by faith and to me that that begins to
[7:34] form this different characterization of
[7:36] one's heart or one's Soul the one that
[7:37] is lifted up by Pride still has the fuel
[7:40] of Doubt but when the just live by faith
[7:44] and and notice the connection there that
[7:46] the soul that is uh lifted up is looking
[7:50] maybe to himself and looking to what he
[7:52] does and he's justified by his works and
[7:55] his uh his efforts and everything he's
[7:57] do his showing off he feels justifies
[8:00] them but then the word says but the just
[8:02] shall live by his faith so we're
[8:05] justified by faith apart from the law
[8:07] that our justification isn't in how good
[8:10] we can be and how clean we can live and
[8:12] how how people receive Us and how much
[8:14] we're accepted if there's going to be
[8:16] people that will take justification by
[8:18] faith and take believe only and turn it
[8:21] into lasciviousness it's just in their
[8:23] nature to do it and what I wouldn't want
[8:26] to do is Rob the believer who is Born
[8:28] Again by the word of God robbed from
[8:30] them the ability to live by faith and
[8:33] find their Acceptance in the Beloved by
[8:35] faith and faith alone I wouldn't want to
[8:37] take that away from them just because
[8:39] there's a bunch of people who don't know
[8:40] how to handle Grace so I I feel that
[8:43] there's no danger in preaching the word
[8:46] of God in such a way to where the elect
[8:48] every time they hear the word of God are
[8:51] connected deep more deeply with Christ
[8:52] by faith and have a greater appreciation
[8:55] for the word just to believe it and
[8:56] accept it and and not be wor worried
[8:59] about those that just walk away and say
[9:01] well I believe I'm
[9:03] fine Galatians 3:1 it says but that no
[9:06] man is justified by the law in the sight
[9:09] of God so God is not looking to your
[9:11] showing off he's not looking as to
[9:12] whether or not you can fulfill
[9:14] everything and so this man who is
[9:17] Justified who feels he's justified by
[9:19] the law Paul's saying you're not in the
[9:22] sight of God he says it is evident for
[9:24] the just shall live by faith there are
[9:27] no works that justify us
[9:30] now we could look it from John's
[9:31] standpoint and excuse me James
[9:33] standpoint he begins to look at it from
[9:34] the standpoint of God uh Paul looks at
[9:37] from the standpoint of God that he
[9:39] justifies you by your faith we're
[9:40] anchored there we believe it we accept
[9:42] it that's where we're we're rooted in
[9:44] and then we know that a life that has
[9:46] been changed by the baptism of the Holy
[9:48] Ghost a life that has the grace of God
[9:50] upon it then will live a life that is in
[9:53] continuity with the spirit of the word
[9:55] of God and therefore your Works justify
[9:58] that you've been born
[9:59] again in that sense that James is
[10:02] looking at it but here there are no
[10:04] works that justify you in the sight of
[10:05] God there's no amount of showing off
[10:07] that's going to save you or vindicate
[10:09] you so in Psalm 34:2 it says my soul
[10:12] shall make her boast in the Lord The
[10:15] Humble shall hear thereof and be
[10:18] glad The Unborn again Soul has this
[10:20] weakness of doubt that chokes out faith
[10:23] in the word of God The Unborn again Soul
[10:25] has this weakness of doubt that hinders
[10:28] the growth of the word so when we can
[10:30] allow our souls to just be make her
[10:32] boast in the Lord to be justified by
[10:35] faith that's a soul that has cast down
[10:38] Pride this the heart of the man is
[10:41] closely connected with this pride of
[10:43] life and we see the example in Saul and
[10:47] popularity so as s brother brandom
[10:50] teaches that Saul represented this
[10:51] danger of popularity he says Saul fell
[10:53] by
[10:54] Pride popularity is it means to uh be to
[10:58] be beloved by people or to enjoy being
[11:02] liked enjoy being admired and supported
[11:06] and so this diff popularity is to be
[11:08] admired and liked and enjoyed by a lot
[11:09] of people and the D danger the
[11:11] temptation of popularity is to really
[11:13] really like it to be influenced by it
[11:16] Luke chapter 6: 26 this is a little bit
[11:19] of review from Wednesday it warns when
[11:21] beware when and woe when all men speak
[11:24] well of you because there's this danger
[11:27] within our human nature that we want to
[11:29] please others and so we'll say to things
[11:32] to people that we think they want to
[11:33] hear so that they like us or so that we
[11:35] don't alienate ourselves from them and
[11:37] Jesus is saying look what you did to the
[11:39] prophets if they spoke good to you they
[11:41] were your Prophet if they didn't you
[11:43] rejected them so be Leery and beware
[11:45] when all speak well of you because there
[11:47] in lies the the the sin of the pride of
[11:50] life or the danger of popularity in John
[11:52] 12:43 it says that many didn't believe
[11:56] and then it said some did but they were
[11:58] afraid to follow follow or they're
[12:00] afraid to say that they believed because
[12:02] they would get kicked out of their
[12:03] church and so it says for they love the
[12:06] praise of men more than the praise of
[12:08] God when you love the praise of men when
[12:11] you want to be justified in the sight of
[12:12] men more than you want to be justified
[12:14] in the sight of God when you're more
[12:16] worried about how your Works can declare
[12:17] to others whether or not you're a good
[12:19] person than you are that your faith
[12:21] declares to God that you believe then
[12:23] that's the danger for they loved the
[12:25] praise of men more than the praise of
[12:27] God maybe we could argue it's not wrong
[12:30] to love the praise of men we could try
[12:31] that out on anybody here and we could
[12:34] prove that human as human beings we we
[12:36] like it when we're praised we're like it
[12:38] when we're told good things and we
[12:40] receive those affirmations that uh
[12:42] encourage Us in things that we're doing
[12:44] but when we love that and look to that
[12:46] more than the praise of God that's when
[12:49] it becomes a stumbling block to
[12:52] ourselves Wednesday night we looked at
[12:54] how Saul is the example of this weakness
[12:56] of the pride of life and popularity
[12:59] when the children of Israel rejected God
[13:02] they asked for a king and so God when he
[13:05] chose the first king he wanted to kind
[13:07] of embody the attitude of the people in
[13:09] that King and he got one that was Head
[13:10] and Shoulders above everybody handsome a
[13:12] goodly and he was somebody that well
[13:14] like if we ever thought of a king this
[13:16] is the king but when Samuel comes to
[13:20] Saul he says is not the all of the
[13:22] desire of Israel upon you in 1st Samuel
[13:25] 9 verse 21 Saul's response is well I'm
[13:29] from the smallest tribe in the least of
[13:31] all the families of the smallest tribe
[13:34] and he seems to be demonstrating
[13:35] humility but really what's behind all of
[13:37] it is an
[13:38] insecurity he's kind of fixated on the
[13:41] fact that his tribe is the smallest one
[13:43] he's kind of fixated on the fact that uh
[13:45] his family is the least of those and
[13:47] he's worried about reputation and the
[13:48] size of things and and I do believe that
[13:52] if there were some humility here he did
[13:54] see himself as part of the smallest
[13:57] tribe and he did see him self as being
[13:59] part of the smallest of the families and
[14:02] so it's maybe there's some humility in
[14:04] the fact that he's willing to
[14:06] acknowledge that he's willing to accept
[14:07] that but he was insecure because of that
[14:11] and these insecurities and the complexes
[14:14] that Saul had they are the products of
[14:17] Pride and I think it's good for us all
[14:19] to consider that when we begin to think
[14:22] well my complexes are solely the result
[14:23] of how I was treated when I was growing
[14:25] up and my insecurities are solely the
[14:27] result of how this person did this and
[14:29] that person did that then there's this
[14:31] way that we kind of absolve ourselves
[14:32] from the way that we Act and the way
[14:34] that we've been
[14:35] nurtured uh and turned into the person
[14:38] that we are and we're not willing to
[14:40] take responsibility but if we begin to
[14:43] recognize that Pride at some point has
[14:46] grabbed a hold of those things and is
[14:47] using it as this excuse that can never
[14:50] be
[14:51] killed just keeps getting back up no
[14:54] uh-uh not my fault not my fault but if
[14:56] we realize that pride is the one that
[14:58] uses it so fre frequently then it gives
[15:00] us it begins to allow the word of God to
[15:02] work in our lives to heal us of those
[15:04] complexes guide us where these
[15:05] insecurities exist and if anything
[15:07] submit him completely and totally to God
[15:09] so he can use them Saul we'll see later
[15:13] Saul in his insecurities wasn't
[15:15] disqualified from being King but when
[15:18] not surrendered to God when not subject
[15:20] to the spirit they became his worst
[15:24] enemy so these insecurities and
[15:26] complexes arise through Pride wherein we
[15:30] lack trust in
[15:32] God when we have had something happen to
[15:35] us or we make a mistake and we are
[15:37] insecure because our pride then we're
[15:40] not trusting God that he'll use all
[15:41] things we're not trusting God that he
[15:43] knoweth all things and and that there's
[15:46] a plan that he has for us in 1st Samuel
[15:49] chapter 10 we see that when Saul is
[15:51] going to be coronated his King before
[15:54] the people they looked around and they
[15:56] couldn't find him and the Lord said
[15:58] behold he hath hid himself among the
[16:01] stuff and
[16:04] um this was not again an act of humility
[16:08] though I I don't want to completely take
[16:10] that away from Saul but when we look at
[16:12] his life story you can kind of look back
[16:14] like we did with balum you could kind of
[16:16] look back and go ah I think I see what's
[16:18] happening here Saul was afraid of being
[16:21] rejected Saul was insecure about whether
[16:23] or not the people would really want him
[16:24] to be king and so this maybe there's
[16:27] some humility there but lurking behind
[16:30] that is this insecurity that drove him
[16:32] to hide and if I could put it this way
[16:35] Saul had this desperate need for
[16:37] acceptance and it was always driving him
[16:39] to do what he was doing he craved to be
[16:42] accepted he desired to be validated he
[16:44] wanted to be approved he he wanted
[16:46] people to think that he was kingly he
[16:48] wanted people to think that he made the
[16:50] right decisions he wanted to uh be
[16:52] accepted and approved and this is what
[16:54] led to his downfall we saw it in 1st
[16:56] Samuel 13 when he offered sacrifice
[16:59] untimely instead of waiting for Sam he
[17:01] said I saw that the people were
[17:02] scattered from me when he did not
[17:05] fulfill the Commandment of the Lord and
[17:06] destroying all the amalekites he said I
[17:08] feared the people and obeyed their
[17:10] voice if you look at these very deeply
[17:13] as I hope to do a little bit better
[17:14] today at the at the heart of what Saul
[17:17] is doing his pride and I'll say this for
[17:20] all of us it leads us to think that our
[17:22] success is dependent upon what we do and
[17:25] not what God does that it leads us to
[17:27] think that well it this is contingent
[17:29] upon my abilities and my effort and my
[17:31] acting and my thinking and not
[17:34] God's and the pride of life will drive
[17:36] us to determine our value by what other
[17:38] people think of us instead of what God
[17:40] thinks about us this is at the heart of
[17:42] Saul's discontent the the heart of
[17:44] Saul's Madness ultimately is he's always
[17:47] looking to his own abilities instead of
[17:49] what God Said and in essence that's what
[17:52] Samuel is talking to him about initially
[17:54] saying well what does it matter if
[17:56] you're the smallest if God chooses you
[17:59] why would you run and hide when you're
[18:01] being coronated King a a and anointed to
[18:03] be king God chose you and you notice
[18:06] there's a difference in Saul to David
[18:08] David this young young kid he's not
[18:11] kingly uh uh like Saul and Saul is
[18:14] hiding and Saul is insecure but when
[18:16] David's called he just Embraces it and
[18:19] he accepts it it's such a stark contrast
[18:21] to these complexes of Saul so our pride
[18:25] and popular pride of life will cause us
[18:29] to rest more on our abilities than
[18:30] resting on God's truth to trust in
[18:33] ourself than to trust in God and this
[18:36] desire to be accepted this PR popularity
[18:38] will cause us to determine our
[18:41] self-worth by what other people think
[18:43] other people's opinions other than what
[18:45] God said about
[18:47] us in Jude 11 verse 11 as it speaks of
[18:52] the way of Cain and running greedily
[18:53] after the heir of balam it says and
[18:55] perished in the gain saying of Kora this
[18:59] is harmonious to the pride of life
[19:02] popularity Saul you'll see the Same
[19:04] Spirit working as it worked even in Cain
[19:06] as it worked in the garden as it tried
[19:08] to work on Christ wherein Saul was
[19:11] motivated by jealousy and personal gain
[19:13] Kora is the same way in the gain saing
[19:17] of core we see the pride of life and the
[19:19] Lust For popularity this desire for
[19:21] status as we read in numbers 16 starting
[19:24] with verse two it says and they rose up
[19:26] before Moses with certain of the
[19:29] children of Israel so what I've
[19:31] transitioned to now is to examine the
[19:32] gain saing of Kora to understand better
[19:35] this pride of life in this temptation of
[19:37] popularity as it worked on
[19:39] Saul certain men rose up before Moses
[19:42] with certain Children of the uh certain
[19:45] of the children of Israel 250 princes of
[19:48] the assembly famous in the congregation
[19:50] men of renown you no what they're kind
[19:53] of going for here consensus popularity
[19:56] uh those that are famous certain
[19:58] children princes famous renowned this is
[20:02] a popularity
[20:03] contest this is showing off this is
[20:06] trying to see who has the biggest
[20:08] campaign
[20:09] rally and and so here was let's get as
[20:12] many uh name brands as possible let's
[20:15] get as many recognizable people uh if
[20:18] there was a front Court they wanted to
[20:20] have all the celebrities sitting on the
[20:22] front row like these are the people that
[20:24] attend attend this kind of rally and it
[20:27] says and they gathered themselves
[20:28] together against Moses and against Aaron
[20:31] I wonder if you were handed a flyer and
[20:33] it said certain of the children of
[20:35] Israel 250 princes of the assembly
[20:37] famous in the congregation men are
[20:38] renowned the premium Ministry are going
[20:40] to be preaching next weekend and we
[20:42] would we would just we would run there
[20:44] you mean the elite Aid is preaching that
[20:46] convention I got to be there right you'd
[20:48] want to be there and then only to find
[20:50] out that they were gathering themselves
[20:51] against the message of the hour and they
[20:53] gathered themselves together against
[20:55] Moses and against Aaron and said unto
[20:57] them you take too much upon you now
[21:00] notice just how
[21:02] much this argument would appeal to the
[21:06] people seeing all the congregation Are
[21:08] Holy and all the congregation go yeah
[21:12] sounds good to me and every one of them
[21:15] and the Lord is among
[21:16] them say on Kora this is sounding really
[21:20] good then why do you lift yourself up
[21:22] above the congregation of Lord and
[21:23] people are sitting there going yeah do
[21:26] you ever think about that we can be
[21:29] we're holy God is amongst us I I we ate
[21:32] the Mana we ate the quail God Vindicated
[21:34] his presence with all of us who do these
[21:36] guys think they are so it is
[21:39] a it's an argument that I think kind of
[21:42] couches itself a little bit in this
[21:43] humility pleading on behalf of the
[21:46] underserved a a and giving voice to the
[21:48] voiceless and the victims and the people
[21:50] the masses they are holy you put too
[21:53] much on yourself you're taking too much
[21:56] control and I'd like to skip to verse n
[21:59] because I think we got enough at least
[22:00] to understand the setting and how that
[22:04] Moses is going to say all right God will
[22:06] prove God will show who he's with not
[22:08] that he's not with Israel but he's going
[22:10] to prove he's not with this movement not
[22:11] with these guys no matter how many
[22:13] celebrities they could get to attend no
[22:15] matter how this would appeal to the
[22:17] Flesh of the people make them feel like
[22:18] they're doing something they're a part
[22:20] of
[22:21] something God is going to Moses said
[22:23] God's going to vindicate it but then
[22:24] this is Moses's rebuke in verse 9 seeth
[22:28] that it but a small thing under you what
[22:31] is it is it Beneath You Now is it too
[22:34] little for you just to be a help in the
[22:37] house of the Lord is it too little for
[22:39] you just to be close enough and to be
[22:41] put in this office and to be put in this
[22:43] position and do what you God's asked you
[22:45] to do are you now when it says do it
[22:47] seem a small thing you're looking down
[22:48] on it you want this isn't popular enough
[22:52] this isn't prestigious enough this isn't
[22:54] going to get me enough clout seeth it
[22:56] but a small thing un you that God of
[22:57] Israel hath separated you from the
[22:59] congregation of Israel to bring you near
[23:01] to himself to do the service of the
[23:02] Tabernacle of the Lord and to stand
[23:04] before the congregation to minister unto
[23:05] them now he's saying this is not this
[23:09] isn't a small thing this is a great
[23:10] honor and a privilege but what does the
[23:12] pride of life do you begin to
[23:14] belittle great things things that are
[23:17] great in the eyes of God when you begin
[23:18] to look through the lens of popularity
[23:20] you begin to think well I want attention
[23:22] I want my name on the Marquee I want to
[23:24] be recognized I want to I want to do
[23:26] more I want to live more I want to be
[23:27] accepted more he says and Heath brought
[23:29] thee near to him and all thy Brethren
[23:31] the sons of Levi with thee and seeky the
[23:33] priesthood also what's driving it it's
[23:37] this it's behind it is this pride of
[23:39] life behind is the pride to say well I
[23:42] don't want to just be the guy washing
[23:43] the utensils I don't want to be the guy
[23:45] that's just leading the chorus I don't
[23:46] want to be the guy that's handling dead
[23:48] animals and all these things I want to
[23:50] be the main man I want to be the priest
[23:52] I want to be the
[23:53] prophet and he says for which cause both
[23:56] thou and all thy company are gathered
[23:58] together against the Lord because of
[24:00] this attitude you're gathered against
[24:01] God he says what is Aaron that you
[24:04] murmur against him I should I should
[24:06] make this my my avatar what is Aaron
[24:10] that you murmur against him I want to
[24:11] get a bumper
[24:12] sticker number
[24:15] 1611b will be my my license plate what
[24:18] is Aaron and I like how I what what is
[24:21] Aaron that you murmur against him many
[24:24] times when people say so and so got
[24:25] engaged I always say to what
[24:29] what is Aaron that you murmur against
[24:30] you say now why you picking on
[24:32] Aaron wh why why is it why do you have
[24:35] such an attitude if I could say it this
[24:38] way they were presuming above their
[24:40] calling and brother bam touches a lot on
[24:43] presuming and what it is Dev Venture
[24:44] without Authority uses it quite a bit
[24:47] and there's this idea that they wanted
[24:50] it's it's to act without justif proper
[24:52] justification but you have it in your
[24:54] mind presumptively so it's a
[24:57] justification that the man finds within
[24:59] himself within his own soul to cause him
[25:01] to presume to venture without proper
[25:03] authority to act without permission and
[25:06] this is exactly what they're doing
[25:07] they're Gathering against the Lord and
[25:10] and their their campaign slogan is uh we
[25:12] the people all men are created equal we
[25:16] are all holy we are all one we are we
[25:18] all deserve a part but disregarding the
[25:21] clear Vindication of God and even what
[25:23] the overall message was to them it
[25:25] wasn't just to lift up Moses but God was
[25:28] was using what they asked for to lead
[25:32] them into the promised land the word of
[25:34] God had never
[25:35] failed and so they were
[25:38] presuming above what God had called them
[25:41] to and as we continue reading in numbers
[25:43] 16 it's really interesting they had
[25:45] formed their own Camp the language that
[25:47] God uses is so remarkable they had kind
[25:49] of their own movement their own
[25:51] denomination was being formed right
[25:53] underneath in this Exodus and they had
[25:56] kind of formed their own
[25:59] uh
[26:00] Fellowship as an equal to Moses as this
[26:03] kind of counterculture to Moses and I
[26:05] say that to make this point not so much
[26:08] rejecting
[26:10] it as much but as much trying to exist
[26:13] alongside of it they didn't go to Moses
[26:16] and say hey Moses you're dead to us
[26:19] we've got our own leader now we're we're
[26:22] we're going to take this guy and we're
[26:23] going to take this guy and they're going
[26:24] to lead us now it's kind of like Hey
[26:26] we're with you God's with you but they
[26:28] wanted to be identified with it and be
[26:30] equal with it so in verses 23 and 24 and
[26:34] also 26 the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[26:37] Speak unto the congregation saying get
[26:39] you up from about the Tabernacle of Kora
[26:43] Dayan and Abraham notice he calls it the
[26:46] Tabernacle it's not just referred to as
[26:49] you'll see later a collection of tents
[26:51] but now and even if you go back and I
[26:53] was studying what the rabbis how they
[26:55] interpreted it and but the the
[26:57] traditional oral history would would
[26:58] have been back there in the Old
[26:59] Testament that there was some joining
[27:02] together of these of these families
[27:04] underneath one tent and that they begin
[27:07] to Fellowship together and God
[27:08] recognizes it as a tabernacle of Kora so
[27:12] he tells them in verse 26 and he spake
[27:15] Moses says spake under the congregation
[27:17] saying catch this this really want this
[27:19] to hit hard depart I pray you from the
[27:22] tth of these wicked men in touch nothing
[27:25] of theirs L you be consumed in all their
[27:27] sins
[27:28] God exposes this religious demonstration
[27:31] this religious rattling cry as just pure
[27:34] selfish ambition these were tents of
[27:37] wicked men the Tabernacle of Kora had
[27:39] been set up right alongside the the the
[27:42] message of th right alongside the the
[27:44] Tabernacle of witness facing the very
[27:46] same thing not leaving it but in the in
[27:48] the midst of it setting up their own
[27:51] Camp what was it
[27:53] competition that's what pride of life
[27:55] will lead to is competition what does po
[27:58] it lead us to
[28:00] comparison this is not rejecting it but
[28:02] this is maybe unknowns to themselves
[28:05] competing with
[28:08] it and what they tried to do
[28:11] God God sends judgment against these
[28:15] Rebels and he threatens to destroy all
[28:19] Israel God affirms Moses and he gives
[28:23] the
[28:24] punishment and then once the
[28:26] punishment's given he's saying only the
[28:28] seed of Aaron can offer incense in verse
[28:31] 39 and elezar the priest took the Brazen
[28:33] sensors wherein they they that were
[28:35] burnt had offered and they were made
[28:37] broad plates for covering of the altar
[28:40] notice to be a memorial under the
[28:42] children of Israel that no stranger
[28:45] which is not the seed of Aaron come near
[28:47] to offer incense before the Lord that he
[28:50] be not as Kora and as his company as the
[28:54] Lord said to him by the hand of Moses
[28:56] don't be like Cor
[29:00] be not as Kora and as his company who
[29:04] presumed to be able to take the place or
[29:07] to be equal to or to exist right right
[29:10] within the framework of it but all the
[29:11] while ignoring and denying the clear
[29:13] will of God and this was set to be a
[29:16] memorial under the children of Israel
[29:18] that no one other than the priesthood
[29:20] could offer incense and maybe in your
[29:23] mind you've already gone right to this
[29:24] place in scripture but in 2 Chronicles
[29:26] 26 Uzziah does that very thing and as
[29:31] you study the life of Uzziah this is the
[29:32] only blemish on his record he was
[29:35] upright and did a lot of great things
[29:37] and he otherwise would have been a
[29:38] perfect King but it says in verse 16 but
[29:41] when he was strong his heart was lifted
[29:44] up to his destruction when he was
[29:46] blessed when he succeeded when he was
[29:48] strong his heart got lifted up he was no
[29:51] longer resting in something Beyond
[29:53] himself but begin to think look what
[29:55] I've done he got lifted up in his soul
[29:58] he got the pride of life he got kind of
[29:59] eased into this popularity this thirsty
[30:02] to be accepted and be perceived as great
[30:04] and he got lifted up to his Destruction
[30:06] for he transgressed against the Lord his
[30:08] God and went into the Temple of the Lord
[30:10] to burn incense upon the altar of
[30:13] incense to do so he would have had to
[30:15] ignore the
[30:17] memorial to do so he would have ignored
[30:20] the reminder he would have ignored
[30:22] everything that signified and said
[30:24] you've never done this a day in your
[30:25] life there's only certain people who do
[30:27] this you cannot intrude on upon this
[30:28] office but yet he steps Beyond his own
[30:31] calling and he presumes Beyond it even
[30:34] if I could say maybe not above your
[30:36] calling but out of your calling into
[30:38] somebody
[30:39] else's and then immediately Azariah the
[30:41] priest went in after him and with four
[30:43] score Priests of the Lord that were
[30:45] Valiant
[30:46] men and they with stod Uzziah the king
[30:50] and said him it pertaineth not under the
[30:52] Uzziah to burn incense unto the Lord but
[30:55] to the priest of the sons of Aaron that
[30:56] are consecrated to burn incense go out
[30:58] of the sanctuary for thou has
[31:00] trespassed neither shall it be for thine
[31:03] honor from the Lord God that's
[31:07] powerful the grace that was being
[31:09] extended to King Uzziah In This Moment
[31:12] was you're not allowed to do this stop
[31:15] it's not going to honor the lord it's
[31:17] not going to bring to you what you think
[31:18] it can bring you this isn't right don't
[31:22] do it and he's been confronted by all
[31:25] these priests and Azariah and it says in
[31:28] verse 19 then Uzziah was wroth
[31:31] wow it's it's akin to those that
[31:34] whenever they're confronted with truth
[31:35] in the reality instead of just being
[31:37] like oh I am so sorry they get
[31:40] angry and before you start trying to
[31:42] identify all the canes and all theas and
[31:44] all the souls in your life it's you it's
[31:48] human
[31:49] nature I'm sorry it's
[31:52] me and you're all like okay yeah all
[31:54] right that's better we were trying to
[31:55] figure out who it was it's you all right
[31:57] what about
[31:58] Aaron what is
[32:02] Aaron Uzziah was wroth and had a sensor
[32:05] in his hand to burn incense and while he
[32:07] was wroth with the priest other words
[32:09] when it says the Sens was still say he
[32:11] didn't stop what he was doing he was
[32:13] going to keep doing it the leprosy even
[32:16] rose up in his forehead before the
[32:17] priest in the house of the Lord and
[32:18] beside the incense altar leprosy is a
[32:21] type of
[32:23] sin remember Gesa in Second Kings I
[32:26] think chapter 5 when he uh Elisha that
[32:30] non got was washed and he was made clean
[32:32] he wanted to present a bunch of gifts to
[32:34] Elisha and what did Elisha do say I
[32:35] don't need
[32:36] it lust of the flesh lust of the eyes
[32:38] pride of life man that's the big three
[32:40] everything you're offering me he he in
[32:42] in that whole story he's denying all of
[32:44] it but Gesa is sitting there kind of
[32:47] going really all right okay non leaves
[32:50] him what does Gesa do he runs after him
[32:52] and says um he changed his mind he wants
[32:56] all of it non's Happ happy to give it
[32:59] and what happened to G Gesa
[33:01] leprosy it's a it's leprosy is a type of
[33:05] sin as brother bam says quite often it
[33:09] happens when one acts for the wrong
[33:11] motive and the wrong objective
[33:14] deceitfully the gain saying of core is
[33:16] typified
[33:18] in this stepping outside of a calling
[33:21] this religious movement this religious
[33:23] demonstration but yet there's selfish
[33:25] ambition it's for popularity it's for
[33:27] pride it's for politicking it's showing
[33:31] off and well as we'll go
[33:35] further you see that there's this
[33:37] pattern of changing God's word for
[33:39] personal
[33:40] benefit changing the if we change the
[33:43] word of God for our benefit it's rooted
[33:45] in the pride of life has some connection
[33:48] with popularity when we ignore water
[33:51] down modify or make an excuse to indulge
[33:54] or cater to the pride of life or cater
[33:56] to The Big Three
[33:59] that's that's that that's uh the pride
[34:01] of life that's popularity anytime we say
[34:04] wellow I'm going to make an excuse for
[34:06] it I'm GNA I I'm going to change this or
[34:08] I want to indulge I want to cater to to
[34:11] any one of these things it's generally
[34:12] going to be this pride of life I want to
[34:14] come out looking right in the
[34:16] end and again it isn't a rejection of
[34:19] the
[34:20] word the label to be a word
[34:23] rejector is for those that are familiar
[34:26] with the message of the hour no one
[34:28] would say well I'm a Christian but I
[34:30] reject the
[34:31] Bible is it safe to say I'm a Christian
[34:35] but I reject Christ as being the
[34:37] Christ it
[34:39] just I believe Jesus died for my sins
[34:42] but I don't believe Jesus was the
[34:43] Messiah so there's you can have this
[34:46] there's just this in there's this logic
[34:49] that people come to ultimately to
[34:50] realize that well I can't reject the
[34:52] word and be right that's right and I
[34:54] can't openly reject the word so what you
[34:57] want to do is you want to change the
[34:59] word that you're receiving or ignore the
[35:01] word that does isn't uh convenient as
[35:04] we've already seen a lot of this in the
[35:06] series on Liberty but so it's not
[35:09] necessarily rejecting the word but it's
[35:11] ignoring the full
[35:13] word and this Spirit we can see in
[35:17] Exodus
[35:18] 32:1 Moses was up on the Mountaintop
[35:20] he's getting Commandments from the Lord
[35:22] God is speaking to him and it says when
[35:24] the people saw that Moses delayed to
[35:26] come down out of the
[35:28] the people gathered themselves together
[35:30] unto Aaron and said unto him up make us
[35:33] Gods which shall go before us for as for
[35:36] this Moses the man that brought us up
[35:38] out of the land of Egypt we what not
[35:41] what has become of
[35:43] him they know that Moses is the one that
[35:46] God used to lead them out they don't say
[35:49] that it was any anybody else they're not
[35:51] alleging anything to cast aspersion on
[35:55] his testimony so I would say they're not
[35:58] rejecting Moses but they're dishonoring
[36:00] his message because of
[36:02] impatience if they had been listening to
[36:04] what he had been teaching all those
[36:05] years if they'd been picking up what he
[36:07] was laying down they would have been
[36:09] able just to wait and say look God's
[36:10] been with us this far Moses is up on
[36:13] that mountain just be patient the
[36:15] promise is we won't die in the
[36:17] wilderness the promise is we're going to
[36:18] a land filled with milk and
[36:20] honey this is what God has promised us
[36:23] to stay the course I know there's a lot
[36:26] uh transpiring in these things things
[36:27] that you could pick out of and give more
[36:29] context to it but they were dishonoring
[36:32] the
[36:34] message and as you're familiar with this
[36:36] story this is wherein they worship the
[36:38] golden calf and so the people see that
[36:40] Moses hadn't come they don't know what's
[36:42] happened to him what are we going to do
[36:44] they're not rejecting him but they're
[36:45] saying in his absence what do we do
[36:48] we've been waiting nothing's happened
[36:50] nothing's changed what do we do and so
[36:53] Aid commands the people to get all their
[36:54] gold together and he Fashions and he
[36:56] makes according to the narrative in the
[36:58] bib Bible as we read it he fashion a
[37:00] golden calf and it says in verse 6 and
[37:03] they rose up early on the tomorrow and
[37:05] offered burnt offerings and brought
[37:07] peace offerings and the people sat down
[37:09] to eat and to drink and Rose up to
[37:14] play it's
[37:18] a it's a feast it's a shouting it's a
[37:21] dancing rose up the play they're making
[37:23] marry it's it's this
[37:26] exuberance it's
[37:28] demonstrative and the Lord said unto
[37:30] Moses go get thee down for thy people
[37:31] which thou broughtest out of the land of
[37:33] Egypt have corrupted
[37:35] themselves they have turned aside
[37:37] quickly out of the way which I commanded
[37:40] them notice just how he's saying that as
[37:42] he said before these wicked men a and
[37:45] they're they're departing from the truth
[37:47] and you're trespassing against the Lord
[37:48] and youve Rose up against the Lord in
[37:50] this act they've turned aside out of the
[37:52] way which he had commanded them they
[37:53] have made them a molten calf and have
[37:55] worshiped it and have sacrificed there
[37:56] un to and said these be thy Gods oh go
[38:00] Israel which have brought thee up out of
[38:02] the land of Egypt it's human nature to
[38:05] want to make a God out of something you
[38:07] can see something you can touch and make
[38:09] yourself think that it speaks to you or
[38:12] that it
[38:13] moves and so this is the worst of
[38:15] humanity to take something and
[38:16] substitute it for God you could take
[38:19] just even the Brazen serpent that that
[38:21] is used in the wilderness to stay the
[38:24] the the poison and the plague of
[38:25] serpents they turned around and turn
[38:28] that into an artifact to worship it's
[38:32] human nature to want to take take things
[38:33] make Idols out of them whether it be the
[38:35] gifts or whether it be uh physical
[38:37] locations it's human nature to turn them
[38:39] into gods and make them have the
[38:42] preeminence at the expense of God
[38:45] himself and now notice how Joshua who's
[38:48] waiting down the mountain for Moses
[38:51] Moses comes down says when Joshua heard
[38:53] the noise of the people as they shouted
[38:55] he said unto Moses there is a noise of
[38:57] war in the Camp W Lor right who'll stand
[39:04] draw your swords greatest battle ever
[39:07] fought let's take let's take Richmond
[39:10] right there a shadow war in the camp
[39:13] there's a new testament bride rising up
[39:16] she's going to go to war well here's a
[39:19] noise of war in the
[39:20] camp and he said it is not the voice of
[39:23] them that shout for Mastery because they
[39:24] have conquered some something neither is
[39:27] the voice of them that cry for being
[39:28] overcome as one that would lament being
[39:31] conquered but the noise of them that
[39:34] sing do I
[39:36] hear this word sing here I want you to
[39:39] really uh meditate on this a little bit
[39:43] it's the same word that is used of
[39:44] Mariam in Exodus 15 when she answered
[39:48] them and began to sing and
[39:51] dance and so if we just took Exodus 32
[39:55] and said oh well wherever you hear the
[39:58] noise of war and wherever you hear
[39:59] singing and wherever you see dancing
[40:01] it's a wicked spirit and it's evil and
[40:04] it's not right but then we remember that
[40:07] Mariam answered that means she sang She
[40:10] Dem she demonstrates her joy and her
[40:12] enthusiasm in this time that they begin
[40:14] to cross over the Red Sea and their
[40:16] enemy is destroyed brother B said if
[40:17] I've ever seen a Holy Roller that is it
[40:19] if there ever was a Pentecostal meeting
[40:21] that was it right and maybe they had
[40:24] that image in mind when they did what
[40:25] they did in Exodus 32
[40:29] it's the same thing let me say this
[40:31] noise isn't always the sound of
[40:33] Liberty noise isn't always the sound of
[40:36] Freedom where you have noise where you
[40:38] have shouting and where you have dancing
[40:40] it does not always mean that there is
[40:44] freedom and so if we cannot take this
[40:46] scripture to say that singing and
[40:47] shouting and dancing is evil then we
[40:50] cannot take Exodus 15 to say that every
[40:52] time it happens it's exactly right or it
[40:55] vindicates anything amen it just is what
[40:58] it is we're human beings I imagine if we
[41:02] were all pigs and the presence of the
[41:04] Lord came down we would just all squeal
[41:07] and grunt right if we were all goats we
[41:10] might faint right run to the highest
[41:13] spot we could I mean that's that's what
[41:15] we would do but we're humans so we have
[41:18] ways of expressing ourselves we have
[41:19] ways of when you fill the spirit move we
[41:21] have ways of being enthused and being
[41:25] excited the noise of them that sing do I
[41:27] hear and it came to pass as soon he came
[41:29] nigh under the camp that he saw the calf
[41:32] and the dancing and Moses's anger waxed
[41:34] hot and he cast the tables out of his
[41:36] hands and break them beneath the
[41:40] mount quite a
[41:44] scene it's not a rejection of the word
[41:47] but right there at the base of the
[41:50] mountain right there as the prophets
[41:52] descending with the Ten
[41:54] Commandments they Aaron has made this
[41:57] decision to create and form another Idol
[42:01] that you'll find later comes up again
[42:02] where they form these two two golden
[42:04] calves later in the Kingdom in in
[42:07] Israel and it causes the people to
[42:09] commit
[42:10] idolatry and brother bam connects Kora
[42:13] to the spirit behind the golden calf
[42:16] brother benam is making
[42:19] them uh synonymous he says it in spoken
[42:22] words The Original Seed I believe it's
[42:23] with the pick up your pen and write so
[42:25] he says it it's written in the pergam
[42:27] Church age this way now the people back
[42:29] there after they had heard the true word
[42:33] and were well acquainted with the fact
[42:35] that a true Prophet was Vindicated of
[42:37] God I say those people fell for Kora and
[42:40] his gain
[42:41] sayings now when we think of the gain SS
[42:44] of Kora we might be in numbers uh 16 and
[42:48] we're thinking about this but now
[42:49] brother bram's going to bring it to
[42:49] Exodus 32 as well cor was not a
[42:52] scriptural Prophet but the people in
[42:55] great numbers with their leaders went
[42:57] him how like the Evangelist today with
[43:00] their golden calf schemes like Kor they
[43:04] look good to the people as cor look good
[43:07] then this is that Spirit popularity and
[43:10] this acceptance and and to be perceived
[43:12] a certain
[43:14] way they look good to the people as Kora
[43:17] looked good then they have blood on
[43:19] their foreheads oil on their hands and
[43:21] balls of fire on the
[43:23] platform that's what they have they have
[43:26] a show right
[43:27] gets a crowd gets a following so after
[43:30] they've heard the true word and they're
[43:32] acquainted with the fact that a true
[43:33] Prophet was Vindicated of God so it
[43:35] happens after the message has been
[43:37] established it happens after it's been
[43:39] accepted it's happened after they know
[43:40] well enough to stay with the word of God
[43:43] Kor evangelists come along with their
[43:45] golden calf schemes that catch the eye
[43:48] of the people and they want to be a part
[43:49] of it they don't want to be left out
[43:52] it's a spirit of Kora the gains of
[43:54] Kora and it's associated with this
[43:58] golden
[43:59] calf in this Worship in Exodus 32 what
[44:02] happens just as core was not rejecting
[44:04] the prophet but trying to exist
[44:05] alongside of it in Exodus chapter 32
[44:08] there's this religious outpouring this
[44:11] religious fervor and what is it a lack
[44:13] of faith and trust in the word of God
[44:14] changing it to change the narrative oh
[44:17] this is what is our Revival not the word
[44:19] of God but these these this is the god
[44:22] that brought us out of
[44:24] Egypt you can have your golden C
[44:28] and eat it too you can have it you can
[44:32] create it you can make it but what leads
[44:34] us what's leading Us in this Third
[44:36] Exodus isn't another man isn't some
[44:38] golden calf isn't it's the word of God
[44:42] and the word
[44:45] only I bring it to this point here and I
[44:49] realize I'm going to be taking a little
[44:50] bit longer on this than maybe we have
[44:52] with some of these other
[44:55] services but but the people with Aaron
[44:58] they show the pride of life they're
[45:00] acting because of the pride of life
[45:03] they're influenced by this desire to be
[45:05] accepted popularity pride of life and
[45:08] this is the same desire that ultimately
[45:09] leads them to want a
[45:11] king and I say this to you in just this
[45:14] brief brief interval here before we go
[45:17] into more about Saul or in this part
[45:19] about uh the golden
[45:22] calf but I say it so you can realize
[45:25] that popularity isn't always the problem
[45:27] for the one that's up
[45:29] front popularity isn't necessarily for
[45:31] the one that's leading you don't look at
[45:33] the king say well his problem is
[45:34] popularity do you realize if your name
[45:36] is never even mentioned and you never
[45:37] seen that popularity can be your problem
[45:40] it can be your Achilles Hill it could be
[45:41] your biggest
[45:42] weakness so popularity isn't just for
[45:45] the person out front but it's also a
[45:47] temptation to those that are
[45:49] following because often we'll follow
[45:51] because the pride of life we'll follow
[45:54] because of popularity we want to be
[45:56] accepted we we want to be in we don't
[45:58] want to be left out whatever the fomo
[46:00] might be we want to be sure that we're
[46:01] there we're a part of it and you may not
[46:03] be the one leading it you may not be the
[46:05] one getting credit your name may not be
[46:06] in the credits or the Marquee but you
[46:08] want to be a part of it and the very
[46:10] thing that's leading the leader is the
[46:12] very thing that's leading you the very
[46:14] thing that is a temptation to the king
[46:16] is the very thing that's a temptation to
[46:19] all the subjects because it wasn't just
[46:21] Kora and Dayan and Abraham that went
[46:23] before him but they able to get men of
[46:24] renown and people had status and able to
[46:27] cause the
[46:28] people why the Same Spirit works on the
[46:31] followers that works on the leaders in
[46:34] Exodus 3221 and 22 and Moses said unto
[46:37] Aaron what did this people do unto you
[46:40] what did this people unto thee that thou
[46:42] has brought so great a sin upon them
[46:45] what did what did you how did you let
[46:47] the people do this to you Moses no doubt
[46:49] was familiar with Aaron he knew that
[46:51] Aaron was familiar with what God
[46:53] required and he's like how did you do
[46:54] this and Aaron said let not the anger of
[46:56] my Lord Wax Hot he's speaking to Moses
[46:59] thou knowest the people that they are
[47:01] set on Mischief that's my other bumper
[47:06] sticker you know what is Aaron well thou
[47:09] knowest the people and that they're set
[47:12] on
[47:13] Mischief it's
[47:15] pride pride of the people
[47:19] perverts the desire for
[47:22] popularity because we could say well
[47:23] being famous in itself isn't wrong being
[47:25] popular isn't wrong I mean if if that
[47:27] was so if we really really hated
[47:29] somebody in the church let's just make
[47:30] them the most popular
[47:32] person do you know brother Joel Kawai do
[47:36] you know him have you ever met him and
[47:38] we just make him like we just make not
[47:41] that I hate you brother Joel but there's
[47:43] you just make them popular but just
[47:45] because everybody knows your name
[47:46] doesn't mean know make you evil so it's
[47:49] how Pride works on the fame the
[47:53] acceptance it begins to trust in the
[47:55] fact that wow there's 250 other princes
[47:59] these are men of
[48:01] renown it's Pride that perverts
[48:04] popularity and if you continue Aaron
[48:07] blames the people you know the people
[48:08] they're set on Mischief they're set on
[48:10] evil that that's just the nature of the
[48:11] people and Moses is probably going yeah
[48:13] well yeah I've seen
[48:15] it but Aaron was influenced by the
[48:19] people and you know what Aaron
[48:21] does he doesn't own it what does he say
[48:23] well a gold the golden calf just
[48:25] supernaturally came out it was
[48:27] Miracle it just happened we didn't we
[48:29] didn't beat this out of the people and
[48:30] we didn't drum it up and we didn't
[48:31] manufacture this this just happened it
[48:33] was super it was spontaneous the
[48:35] spontaneous calf came out of it and he
[48:41] lies and brother brandham says in the
[48:43] church age book he said they say never
[48:46] mind what God's word says I'm reading
[48:48] this because I really want to nail down
[48:49] the point how that this pride of life
[48:51] will change the word of God for personal
[48:53] benefit it Waters it down it modifies it
[48:55] at the very least least what it does is
[48:57] it just ignores the full
[49:00] word Les you become in your own mind
[49:04] unpopular never mind what the God's word
[49:07] says you can't understand it we have to
[49:09] interpret it for you furthermore the
[49:11] Bible's not finished it has to change
[49:13] with the times and we'll tell you what
[49:15] the changes
[49:16] are how contrary that is to the word of
[49:19] God that emphatically States let God be
[49:22] true but every man a
[49:24] liar whenever there's a conflict with
[49:27] the truth remember this whereever
[49:30] whenever there's a conflict with the
[49:32] truth you go with the word of
[49:34] God Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[49:36] not one word of God will fail I would
[49:39] even go so I I I feel that this deserves
[49:41] to be said if I ever say something that
[49:44] in your Revelation perception or
[49:46] inspiration however whether I implied or
[49:49] you infer it if I say something that
[49:51] conflicts with the truth conflicts with
[49:54] what God Said you take what God said
[49:57] right I would love it if you could give
[49:59] me the benefit of the doubt said maybe
[50:00] his tongue just slipped maybe I maybe
[50:02] that I didn't quite understand it that
[50:03] way but you take what God says don't
[50:06] ever let anyone stand up here and say
[50:08] well I know brother brandham said this
[50:11] but I'm going to tell you what he means
[50:14] or I know the Bible says this but now
[50:16] it's changed or it's different you've
[50:18] got to go with what God gave you if you
[50:20] want to be a revisionist historian if
[50:22] you want to start changing things to
[50:24] update the context of the time that
[50:26] we're living in you might as well just
[50:27] get rid of the Bible you might as well
[50:30] just get rid of the message of the hour
[50:32] and be your own God and worship your own
[50:34] golden
[50:36] calf there's only one measuring stick
[50:38] there's only one Plum line it's the word
[50:41] of God away with the experience as the
[50:43] plum line away with Miracles and signs
[50:45] and wonders that people try to propagate
[50:47] to vindicate their conflicting
[50:50] truth we love Miracles we love signs and
[50:53] wonders we love the gifts but you've got
[50:54] to stay with the word and when someone
[50:57] uses some Showmanship to lead you from
[50:59] the word wake
[51:01] up you must reject it right Heaven and
[51:05] Earth will pass away but not one a word
[51:07] of God will fail notice this last
[51:09] statement so the people are led by
[51:11] people who presume to be what they're
[51:14] not to
[51:16] presume to assume without with to it
[51:19] means to assume with
[51:21] confidence when you presume you're not
[51:23] just going no it's like this is it
[51:27] right to suppose to be true without
[51:31] proof to go beyond what is proper and
[51:34] right brother M says over and over he
[51:37] says to Adventure without official
[51:40] Authority Venture without official
[51:41] Authority Venture without Authority
[51:46] presuming people are led by people who
[51:49] presume to be what they're
[51:50] not so people are led by people
[51:54] presuming and what do you have to do to
[51:56] follow you presume
[51:58] to they use popularity and pride as an
[52:03] excuse to ignore or disobey or change
[52:06] God's
[52:08] word bringing it back to
[52:11] Samuel I think I can go through this
[52:13] pretty quick and finish today I hope I
[52:16] can finish
[52:17] today but 1st Samuel 13 verses 8 to
[52:21] 14 if you read in there uh Saul Waits
[52:25] until the seventh day just as Samu had
[52:28] appointed and you'll notice this
[52:31] that Samuel said wait wait seven days
[52:35] but even before the seventh day is over
[52:37] Saul calls for peace and burnt offerings
[52:40] so Saul didn't even wait the full
[52:43] time but when he felt like he had waited
[52:46] long enough in his seventh day he was
[52:49] just going to go ahead and declare the
[52:51] Revival
[52:52] himself and in verse 10 and it came to
[52:54] pass that as soon as he had made an end
[52:56] of of offering the burnt offerings
[52:58] behold Samuel came the day is not over
[53:01] yet so Samuel wasn't late he just wasn't
[53:03] there when Saul wanted him there and
[53:06] Saul went out to meet him and that he
[53:08] might salute him and Samuel said what
[53:10] has thou done and Saul said because I
[53:13] saw that the people were scattered from
[53:14] me and that thou camest not within the
[53:16] days appointed and that the Philistines
[53:18] gathered themselves together mishmash
[53:20] therefore said I the Philistines will
[53:22] come now down now upon me to gilgal and
[53:24] I have not made supplication under the
[53:26] Lord I forced myself therefore and
[53:30] offered a burnt offering of course he's
[53:32] the victim of course he sacrificed I I
[53:36] didn't want to but you were
[53:39] late and we waited and waited and you
[53:42] didn't come at the right time he says I
[53:45] forced myself to offer these burnt
[53:47] offerings and what's his reasons the
[53:49] people are scattered from me and I was
[53:51] afraid to lose a
[53:53] battle I I was afraid to get beat I'm
[53:55] King and everyone's looking to me and
[53:57] this my first test and this I I've got
[54:00] to perform I got to get this right and I
[54:01] was
[54:03] afraid but Saul's Folly is exposed
[54:05] despite his re religious
[54:08] protestation despite his care for the
[54:10] people his folly is exposed just like
[54:13] Judas was like wow it's a lot of money
[54:16] we're wasting here a we could have sold
[54:18] that and really provided for the poor
[54:21] and everybody's like whoa we didn't even
[54:22] think about that and he's over there
[54:24] going right am I am I right I'm right
[54:26] right like we could feed the Homeless
[54:28] and we could do this and why right I'm
[54:30] right and everybody's like well that
[54:31] sounds like God's over there going uh
[54:33] he's just wants the money he doesn't
[54:36] really care for the poor he's not in it
[54:38] for the people he's in it for himself
[54:41] and Saul was so he was so desperate for
[54:44] approval he wanted to be perceived as
[54:46] great he wanted to come across as
[54:48] confident if I could say this it was
[54:50] only important that he was
[54:52] right and I find this Spirit to be very
[54:55] subtle that people often times they'll
[54:58] argue to no end because in their minds
[55:01] they want to be correct they want to be
[55:03] right and so even when you've convinced
[55:05] them that they're wrong they want to
[55:07] explain to you that they were right for
[55:08] being
[55:09] wrong yeah I know I made a huge mistake
[55:12] but this is the reason why and
[55:14] this so that you're like so I was right
[55:16] right right I'm right right it's like
[55:19] well no you're wrong but it's that Pride
[55:23] you're only worried about being correct
[55:24] you're only worried another way to say
[55:25] you're only worried about being
[55:27] justified in acting was okay fine I
[55:31] sinned but this is why so am I not
[55:34] justified I was doing it for this reason
[55:36] and I saw this need and this was
[55:38] happening and yeah I may be wrong and my
[55:40] cure may be worse than the poison and
[55:42] this may be this way and that may be
[55:43] that way and I might have a lot of lot
[55:45] of reasons why and you want that to
[55:47] justify your error and God saying sorry
[55:50] pal it's
[55:52] air but Saul demonstrates this
[55:57] prideful countenance in this Spirit
[55:59] where he doesn't want to appear
[56:01] foolish doesn't want to look foolish in
[56:03] front of the
[56:04] people and because he didn't want to
[56:06] look bad in front of the people he
[56:07] failed to trust
[56:12] God brother Bram said if I prayed for a
[56:15] thousand I'm kind of butcher it but I
[56:17] think the thought is essentially if I
[56:18] prayed for a thousand people and none of
[56:20] them lived I'd still pray for a thousand
[56:21] and
[56:22] one why because you're trusting God not
[56:24] the not the stats
[56:27] you're you're not running the metrics
[56:28] and say well what what the does anybody
[56:30] know what the odds are when you flip a
[56:34] coin 5050 well what if you flipped the
[56:36] coin a 100 times and it came up heads
[56:38] every time what's the probability on the
[56:41] 101st doesn't
[56:43] change but this is human mindset like uh
[56:47] I'm going to say the odds are U it's
[56:50] changed no it hasn't God has God's word
[56:52] doesn't change you made a promise it's
[56:54] his promise faith in the word of God re
[56:56] the results and those things that's not
[56:57] justification to to maneuver outside the
[56:59] word of God you've got to stay with the
[57:03] word and so the prophet says in verse 13
[57:07] thou Hast done foolishly thou Hast not
[57:09] kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God
[57:10] which he commanded thee for now would
[57:12] the Lord have established thy kingdom
[57:14] upon Israel forever now I want to say he
[57:17] punishes them where it
[57:19] hurts and he he finds where the pride
[57:23] was this is what was causing your
[57:25] problems as you took too much ownership
[57:27] of the throne you took too much
[57:28] ownership of the crown and now you'll do
[57:31] anything to keep the
[57:33] crown he says but now thy kingdom shall
[57:35] not continue the Lord hath sought him a
[57:38] man after his own heart and the Lord
[57:40] hath commanded him to be Captain over
[57:41] his people because thou Hast not kept
[57:43] that which the Lord commanded thee do
[57:45] you realize these words would have stung
[57:46] so deep your kingdom will not continue
[57:50] the Lord's going to find somebody with a
[57:51] better heart he's going to give it to
[57:53] somebody else to be a captain over his
[57:55] people and you haven't come each one was
[57:57] a dagger to a soul that's lifted up with
[58:01] pride why did he do it pride what was
[58:05] his
[58:07] justification the people religion
[58:10] worship 1st Samuel 14 Saul forbids I I
[58:14] want to use this very quickly he forbids
[58:16] in Psalm 14 1st Samuel 14 he forbids any
[58:19] man eat he's really desperate to win
[58:21] this battle he wants to get Victory so
[58:23] he says nobody's to eat until evening
[58:25] that I may be Avenged go read the story
[58:29] that I may be Avenged so he wanted the
[58:31] people to be motivated and so through
[58:33] Pride popularity since that's the
[58:35] subject today he becomes tyrannical he
[58:37] begins to impose upon people something
[58:40] that wasn't reasonable it was irrational
[58:42] he's trying to use fear to Mo motivate
[58:44] them but for whose gain his own I want
[58:47] you guys to be motivated to fight don't
[58:49] eat until the evening till our foe has
[58:50] been
[58:51] vanquished and he acts as a God to the
[58:53] people and says that they may not eat
[58:55] and he threatens death he says curse and
[58:57] as we read later you'll find that
[58:59] essentially we're saying a death penalty
[59:00] to anybody who disobeys so the men slay
[59:04] the Philistines but after they slay them
[59:06] they're famished and they begin to eat
[59:07] the animals raw eat it with the blood
[59:11] and as they slay the livestock and eat
[59:13] them with the blood because they're
[59:16] starving and and we we know why they're
[59:18] doing this right because Saul said don't
[59:22] eat and his irrational in his Fe wanting
[59:25] to be in control and wanting to to
[59:28] avenge himself he opposes something on
[59:30] the people that only causes them to when
[59:33] they finally win to do something that
[59:36] transgresses and in 1st Samuel 14:33
[59:39] Saul said behold the people sin against
[59:41] the Lord in that they eat with the blood
[59:44] and he said you have transgressed roll a
[59:46] great Stone unto me this day man what a
[59:49] drama
[59:51] King right like this is probably where
[59:53] the term originally came up and they
[59:54] just changed it in time he's so
[59:57] dramatic hey pal you're the one that
[59:59] made him do this nobody eat even his own
[1:00:03] son is like wow why did he say after he
[1:00:04] found out like hey why did he say that
[1:00:06] because we could have eaten this honey
[1:00:07] in these woods and had so much strength
[1:00:09] for the battle like what was he thinking
[1:00:12] it was irrational and instead of him in
[1:00:14] this moment realizing what have I
[1:00:17] done I required of the people to these
[1:00:20] men to not eat and as a result of their
[1:00:23] faithfulness to my command it thrust
[1:00:25] them into this position where they were
[1:00:26] more easily overcome with this hunger to
[1:00:29] eat this meat raw with the blood and he
[1:00:31] said and and sin against the Lord and
[1:00:33] he's like to me the way I read it like
[1:00:35] oh just kill me look what they've done
[1:00:38] they've ruined my great Victory he
[1:00:40] doesn't own
[1:00:42] it and there's a series of lots cast
[1:00:45] I'll just skip to verse 43 and after the
[1:00:47] Lots stay children of Israel the Army
[1:00:50] they're all absolved but the lots are
[1:00:51] cast it's just Samuel and Jonathan and
[1:00:53] Saul says' Jonathan what have you done
[1:00:56] and Jonathan said I did but taste a
[1:00:57] little honey with the end of the rod
[1:00:59] that was in mine hand and lo I must
[1:01:03] die Jonathan was an upright man John was
[1:01:07] willing to accept the punishment of the
[1:01:09] king's irrational
[1:01:12] demand he had to be a good man for his
[1:01:14] heart to be so joined together with
[1:01:16] David's all I did was taste a little bit
[1:01:18] honey my eyes were opened I was enthused
[1:01:20] I had
[1:01:22] Vigor and Saul answers in verse 444 God
[1:01:25] do so so and more also for Thou shalt
[1:01:27] surely die
[1:01:29] Jonathan here is a dad looking at his
[1:01:31] son a king looking at his best
[1:01:34] warrior who says you made the command I
[1:01:38] have to die because I broke
[1:01:41] it I I I set forth to you that Saul was
[1:01:44] irrational because of his
[1:01:46] pride that if he had not had these inner
[1:01:48] mechanisms of pretense and pride and
[1:01:51] being accepted and people thinking he's
[1:01:53] great and being a warrior that's why he
[1:01:55] offered up
[1:01:56] uh the the sacrifices because of the
[1:01:58] people and then here the very next
[1:02:00] chapter he's worried that he's not going
[1:02:01] to win this battle so he puts This
[1:02:03] Record you got to win you got to avenge
[1:02:04] me let's fight don't eat don't eat I
[1:02:06] can't lose this battle as king I can't
[1:02:07] lose this battle and what does he do he
[1:02:09] trusts more in his ability to guide the
[1:02:11] people than to say as David did Lord the
[1:02:14] battle's yours not
[1:02:15] mine this battle belongs to you Lord I
[1:02:19] it looks like the sun's going to go down
[1:02:20] and we're not going to win and this
[1:02:21] might look really bad for as me as a
[1:02:24] king Lord what can you do for me this
[1:02:25] today it's because of his pride that he
[1:02:27] makes this IR rational vow or demand
[1:02:30] upon the people and I just asked the
[1:02:32] question is it this moment where Saul
[1:02:34] wakes
[1:02:36] up even if you didn't know the story you
[1:02:38] would know at this point probably not
[1:02:42] his own son has submitted to be uh
[1:02:45] killed for Disobedience and surely In
[1:02:47] This Moment Saul would be like oh what
[1:02:50] have I done what have I done me instead
[1:02:53] yeah let a stone Roll On Me Not because
[1:02:56] I've Done Right and and we've and I this
[1:02:59] is but I because I'm
[1:03:01] wrong and notice in verse 45 and the
[1:03:03] people said unto Saul shall Jonathan die
[1:03:06] who's wrought this great Victory this
[1:03:08] great salvation in Israel God forbid as
[1:03:11] the Lord liveth there shall not one hair
[1:03:12] of his head fall to the ground for he
[1:03:14] hath rot with God this day so the people
[1:03:17] rescued Jonathan that he died
[1:03:20] not is it any surprise that the people
[1:03:22] saved Jonathan and not
[1:03:24] Saul is it any surprise that Saul goes
[1:03:27] back on his own command because of the
[1:03:29] pressure of the people Saul was always
[1:03:32] desperately trying to prove
[1:03:34] himself he's always trying to gain
[1:03:36] approval he always wanted to be accepted
[1:03:38] he he was always looking outside of
[1:03:40] himself am I good am I right is this
[1:03:42] okay is this do you like this is this
[1:03:44] all right am I doing good am I a good
[1:03:46] King is everything okay he wasn't
[1:03:47] resting in who he was and what God said
[1:03:49] about him the very next chapter 15 God
[1:03:53] demands he says this utterly destroy all
[1:03:55] all they have and spare them not about
[1:03:57] the malachit if you read the story 1st
[1:03:59] Samuel 15 he spares AAG and it says the
[1:04:01] best of sheep the best of oxen best of
[1:04:03] fatlings best of lambs in all that was
[1:04:06] good and destroyed everything that was
[1:04:09] vile and refused I'd like to call this
[1:04:11] presumptive
[1:04:13] religion that here Saul is able to
[1:04:16] concoct a church Charter that Embraces
[1:04:19] Christ and
[1:04:21] salvation constructs a fellowship and a
[1:04:23] tabernacle that lifts up up the message
[1:04:26] of the hour and all that is good and
[1:04:29] destroys everything that is evil but at
[1:04:31] the end of the day is nothing but
[1:04:35] self-justification kept all that was
[1:04:37] good and refused all that was vile and
[1:04:39] that was prohibited under the law kept
[1:04:41] everything that they could use according
[1:04:42] to the law but in verse 13 Samuel came
[1:04:46] to Saul and said unto him this is s Saul
[1:04:49] says this is Saul blessed be thou of the
[1:04:53] Lord I have performed form formed the
[1:04:56] Commandment of the Lord I haven't
[1:05:00] rejected the word I haven't rejected the
[1:05:02] message I'm a message believer I'm this
[1:05:05] I'm that I have performed the
[1:05:07] Commandment of the Lord I wasn't going
[1:05:10] to put these both on one slide so you
[1:05:11] could compare but just let that be uh
[1:05:14] ingrained like just seared into your
[1:05:16] mind I have performed the Commandment of
[1:05:18] the Lord verse three let's just look at
[1:05:20] the Commandment of the
[1:05:22] Lord utterly destroy all that they have
[1:05:26] and spare them not but slay both man and
[1:05:29] woman infant and suckling ox and sheep
[1:05:32] camel and
[1:05:33] ass in other words you could not spare
[1:05:37] the king or the best of the sheep or the
[1:05:40] best of The Oxen or the best of the
[1:05:41] fatlings of the Lambs and all that's
[1:05:43] good and just destroy all that's vile
[1:05:45] and refused and still be able to claim
[1:05:48] I've commit I've kept the
[1:05:53] word and Saul then says well they
[1:05:57] brought them the people
[1:06:03] spared as I close this service I want
[1:06:05] you to realize that Paul's Saul's pride
[1:06:09] of life blinded him to the word of
[1:06:13] God he becomes so obstinate when
[1:06:17] corrected that here he says I commanded
[1:06:20] the word of the Lord there's no humility
[1:06:22] it's always arrogance he gets angry
[1:06:25] because he's driven to be proven
[1:06:28] right he cannot be humbled he cannot
[1:06:31] repent and because of it he's prone to
[1:06:33] jealousy when others
[1:06:35] do even when Saul recognizes in David he
[1:06:39] says David you're a better man than me
[1:06:42] did this did the switch flip permanently
[1:06:44] then no it never changed he could have
[1:06:48] moments where everything's good but he's
[1:06:51] ultimately overcome by these things
[1:06:53] because the failure he has the wrong
[1:06:55] heart the you to Humble or repent he
[1:06:57] says I have kept the Commandment of the
[1:06:59] Lord the Commandment of the Lord was to
[1:07:01] spare nothing destroy them
[1:07:03] all verse 17 and when thou was little in
[1:07:06] thy own sight Samuel now is rebuking
[1:07:08] Saul follow this I'm going to read all
[1:07:09] the way to verse
[1:07:11] 30 ver
[1:07:13] 31 and when thou was little in thine own
[1:07:16] sight was thou not made the head of the
[1:07:18] tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed
[1:07:20] Thee the king of over Israel when you
[1:07:22] thought less of yourself even in your
[1:07:25] complex and insecurities when when that
[1:07:28] you were that's when I made you this so
[1:07:31] there something about I made you when
[1:07:32] you were that way and I knew you were
[1:07:34] that way I made you King why couldn't
[1:07:36] you just keep trusting me and the Lord
[1:07:38] sent thee on a journey and said go and
[1:07:40] utterly destroy the Sinners the
[1:07:41] amalekites and fight against them until
[1:07:43] they be consumed why did you then not
[1:07:46] obey the voice of the Lord but did fly
[1:07:48] upon the spoil and did evil in the sight
[1:07:50] of the
[1:07:52] Lord and Saul said unto Samuel
[1:07:56] yay I have obeyed the voice of the
[1:08:02] Lord the only way I can relate to this
[1:08:04] is being if I was like maybe a math
[1:08:06] tutor or something like like you're not
[1:08:10] serious are
[1:08:11] you it it's so obvious but yet Saul and
[1:08:16] is Saul just trolling the prophet at
[1:08:18] this point well I obeyed right no he
[1:08:23] he's in his mind he's like I have obeyed
[1:08:26] he can't humble himself he can't repent
[1:08:30] I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and
[1:08:31] have gone the way which the Lord sent me
[1:08:34] and somehow in his mind he can interpret
[1:08:37] it where there's a conflict his
[1:08:39] interpretation is going to govern and a
[1:08:41] brought aan the king of amalec and have
[1:08:43] utterly destroyed the amalekites see
[1:08:45] what I did There I destroyed the
[1:08:48] amalekites and I only kept the king of
[1:08:51] AMC AMC
[1:08:53] see right I've have obeyed but the
[1:08:57] people took of the spoil sheep and oxen
[1:09:00] the chief of the things which should
[1:09:01] have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice
[1:09:03] unto the Lord thy God in
[1:09:06] gilgal and and this religious
[1:09:08] justification presumptive religion this
[1:09:11] presuming he's the king should have
[1:09:14] rested with
[1:09:17] him and then Samuel says in verse 22
[1:09:20] hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt
[1:09:22] offerings and sacrifice as in obeying
[1:09:23] the voice of the Lord behold to B is
[1:09:25] better than sacrifice and to hearken
[1:09:27] than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as
[1:09:30] the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness
[1:09:33] is as iniquity and
[1:09:35] idolatry Lord will when I get back I
[1:09:37] want to start on when young ones don't
[1:09:39] grow
[1:09:40] up and and not growing up it's rooted in
[1:09:44] rebellion and
[1:09:46] stubbornness because thou Hast rejected
[1:09:48] the word of the Lord Heath also rejected
[1:09:51] thee from being King Saul would never
[1:09:54] admit to be a word
[1:09:56] rejector if anything he would have
[1:09:58] claimed to have kept it perfectly
[1:10:00] despite the apparent contradictions and
[1:10:03] conflict and Saul said unto Samuel I
[1:10:05] have sinned for I have transgressed the
[1:10:07] Commandment of the Lord in thy
[1:10:10] words because I feared the people and
[1:10:12] obeyed their voice now we feel like
[1:10:15] we're getting somewhere I have sinned
[1:10:17] this is good for Saul right I have
[1:10:20] transgressed the Commandment of the Lord
[1:10:22] Saul is now owning it and thy words like
[1:10:26] so he's the big three he's repented of
[1:10:28] all three I've sinned transgressed and
[1:10:31] thy words I I've done the Commandment th
[1:10:33] words like I want to be sure I'm making
[1:10:34] this right and then all of a sudden the
[1:10:36] justification kicks in the I'm not
[1:10:39] really wrong I was wrong but this is why
[1:10:42] I was wrong and once you know why I was
[1:10:45] wrong he's like I'm guilty of homicide
[1:10:47] but it's justifiable homicide right I I
[1:10:50] have a good reason because I feared the
[1:10:52] Lord and obeyed their voice
[1:10:55] again right back to the people it's been
[1:10:57] I've been well over an hour now I
[1:11:00] acknowledge the length of
[1:11:02] this and then verse 25 you have to catch
[1:11:05] this part otherwise you're going to miss
[1:11:06] it that seems to be good but now he
[1:11:10] starts judging immediately he says now
[1:11:13] therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and
[1:11:14] turn again with me that I may Worship
[1:11:16] the Lord immediately forgive me come
[1:11:20] with me and offer sacrifice with
[1:11:23] me immediately now therefore I pray thee
[1:11:26] pardon my
[1:11:27] sin you'll notice how God deals with
[1:11:29] David later and he allows with with
[1:11:32] basba and how that just kind of lets
[1:11:34] nine months go by and he lets this thing
[1:11:35] just drag on and drag on you realize
[1:11:37] this is how God wants to deal with a
[1:11:39] man's heart and this is the attitude of
[1:11:41] someone it's like okay fine all right on
[1:11:44] that remind you of a teenager I don't
[1:11:46] know where I got
[1:11:47] it okay fine
[1:11:50] okay I don't want to know why I was
[1:11:52] wrong I don't want to live under this
[1:11:54] punishment anymore let's just move on
[1:11:56] okay change the subject adults do it
[1:12:00] quite a bit
[1:12:01] too what is
[1:12:05] Aaron well you know the kids are given
[1:12:08] to
[1:12:10] Mischief turn with me in
[1:12:13] worship and
[1:12:16] then Samuel said unto Saul I will not
[1:12:20] return with thee for thou has rejected
[1:12:23] the word of the Lord and the Lord hath
[1:12:26] rejected thee from being King over
[1:12:28] Israel again you are rejecting the word
[1:12:32] you have rejected the word wherein did
[1:12:36] Saul reject the word I I would like for
[1:12:38] you to think of it this way pray about
[1:12:40] this was it not because he transgressed
[1:12:43] the Commandment but because of his
[1:12:44] willful obstinance to not just humble
[1:12:47] himself and
[1:12:49] repent was the transgression in the
[1:12:52] spirit of it in the willfulness of it
[1:12:55] and the his willful blindness and it
[1:12:57] being rooted in
[1:13:00] Pride he's rejected thee and as Samuel
[1:13:04] turned about to go
[1:13:05] away Saul fell on his face and be to
[1:13:08] rent his garments and say God I'm a
[1:13:11] sinner I'm worthless I'm horrible Lord
[1:13:14] don't take the throne away from Jonathan
[1:13:16] he deserves it he's a better man than
[1:13:20] me no M sorry I don't know what Bible
[1:13:23] you're reading
[1:13:25] he laid a hold upon the skirt of
[1:13:27] Samuel's mantle and rips it I don't have
[1:13:30] time to get into what a a front and a
[1:13:32] disrespect to the messenger this was and
[1:13:35] Samuel said unto him the king the Lord
[1:13:37] hath rent the Kingdom of Israel from
[1:13:38] thee this day and hath given it to a
[1:13:41] neighbor of thine that is better than
[1:13:45] thou that's the that's that that
[1:13:50] gift that's what that is that is that is
[1:13:54] the worst thing could have said to
[1:13:57] him you I've given it to your neighbor
[1:13:59] that's better than you the kingdom is
[1:14:02] going to get ripped out of your hands
[1:14:03] and given to a man that's better than
[1:14:05] you you're you're not as good as this
[1:14:08] guy you're not as good as your
[1:14:09] neighbor and also the strength of Israel
[1:14:12] will not lie nor repent there it
[1:14:15] is for he is not a man that he should
[1:14:17] repent God will not lie God does not
[1:14:20] need to repent he is the strength of
[1:14:22] Israel but Samuel or Saul this is what
[1:14:24] you should have been doing you shouldn't
[1:14:26] have been lying you should have been
[1:14:31] repenting
[1:14:32] now that that had to get Saul right
[1:14:35] immediately that punches Saul deeply in
[1:14:37] his soul his attitude's going to change
[1:14:39] right right right we know it he's going
[1:14:43] to do it now he's going to do it sack
[1:14:45] cloth and Ashes GNA humble
[1:14:47] himself then he said I have sinned yet
[1:14:51] honor me
[1:14:53] now Look at look at this pride of life
[1:14:55] this pop look at in front of all the
[1:14:57] people you have to catch this in this
[1:14:58] I've sinned yet honor me now I pray thee
[1:15:01] before the Elders of my people and
[1:15:03] before
[1:15:04] Israel don't walk away from me
[1:15:08] Samuel don't let the people know I've
[1:15:10] rejected the Lord can we just continue
[1:15:13] on for pretense sake I'm going to lose
[1:15:15] the kingdom everything's going to change
[1:15:17] I get it but he's not willing to repent
[1:15:19] there's the inability in this moment to
[1:15:22] recognize yes how hard how his heart had
[1:15:25] become so lifted up he says okay I've
[1:15:27] sin honor me now and stand by my side
[1:15:31] before the people before all Israel and
[1:15:33] turn again with me go with me that I may
[1:15:36] Worship the Lord thy
[1:15:39] God and you Saul Samuel turned again
[1:15:43] after Saul and Saul worshiped the Lord
[1:15:47] because at the end of the day he wasn't
[1:15:48] really wor worried about truly
[1:15:50] worshiping the Lord in spirit and in
[1:15:51] truth he just wanted the prophet the
[1:15:53] message to be close to him
[1:15:56] he he wanted to look like we're in this
[1:15:58] we're message we're in this together I
[1:16:00] know maybe coming across is a little
[1:16:02] hard about this but you got to realize
[1:16:03] just how subtle these Kingdom Builders
[1:16:05] are where they can even I'll just be so
[1:16:07] blunt as to say they can even have the
[1:16:09] same name as brother brandom but it's
[1:16:11] become an idol to get people out of the
[1:16:14] perfect will of
[1:16:18] God I've sin put honor me now let all
[1:16:22] the elders see in that I'm still with
[1:16:26] the prophet let all the Israel see that
[1:16:29] you're going with me to Worship the Lord
[1:16:31] so that in their eyes I'm not rejected
[1:16:33] so that in their eyes I'm still right so
[1:16:36] that in their eyes I'm not wrong and
[1:16:38] Samuel still goes with them and they
[1:16:42] Worship the
[1:16:43] Lord Saul is never healed of his eye
[1:16:46] disease Saul is never healed did I say
[1:16:49] Samuel Saul is never healed of his eye
[1:16:52] disease his heart is never changed to
[1:16:55] just trust God his heart was never
[1:16:57] changed just to abandon himself to the
[1:17:01] consequence and say I've
[1:17:04] sinned take it away from me now whoever
[1:17:07] this neighbor is let him have the
[1:17:09] kingdom you'll find that there's people
[1:17:11] that will sin against God sin against
[1:17:14] the people men that'll that'll that'll
[1:17:18] transgress the word of God and still
[1:17:21] cling to privilege and cling to rights
[1:17:25] never trying to atone never trying to
[1:17:26] make anything
[1:17:30] right and it's this pride of life we'll
[1:17:32] invite the musicians to come or just the
[1:17:34] couple that are playing since
[1:17:36] Rebecca and
[1:17:38] whoever's
[1:17:40] playing the pride of life and this Lust
[1:17:42] For
[1:17:43] popularity it drives Saul ultimately we
[1:17:46] see that it's it promotes this jealousy
[1:17:48] in this
[1:17:50] murder but John don't show this
[1:17:51] scripture just yet but I just want to
[1:17:53] read this this scripture it says this is
[1:17:57] later in the story of
[1:17:59] um the story of Saul and Saul was very
[1:18:03] wroth no
[1:18:05] surprise and the samean displeased him
[1:18:09] it's a few chapters later something's
[1:18:11] making Saul angry again he's mad what
[1:18:13] could it
[1:18:14] be what saying could make Saul so
[1:18:19] angry and so
[1:18:22] upset it says in 1st Samuel 18:8 Saul
[1:18:26] was very angry very wroth and the same
[1:18:28] displeased him brother John if you want
[1:18:29] to put it up there if I gave it and he
[1:18:31] said they have ascribed unto David 10
[1:18:34] thousands and to me they have ascribed
[1:18:37] but
[1:18:39] thousands maybe if he was still little
[1:18:41] in his own eyes and he just kind of
[1:18:42] embraced the calling and trust in the
[1:18:44] Lord he would have said I got my
[1:18:47] thousand
[1:18:48] nope and then his
[1:18:51] conclusion in what can he have more but
[1:18:54] the king
[1:18:55] om notice how quickly he begins to think
[1:18:58] about oh everyone's happy with what
[1:19:00] David did everyone's enjoying David
[1:19:02] Everyone likes David David's slain his
[1:19:04] 10 thousands Saul his thousands and
[1:19:06] what's next but him to want to take my
[1:19:09] job what's next but for him to want to
[1:19:11] take the kingdom and it says and Saul
[1:19:14] eyed David from that day
[1:19:17] forward he
[1:19:19] eyem competition comparison jealousy
[1:19:23] jealousy is an inability to rejoice when
[1:19:25] others are
[1:19:26] blessed so you might think well I'm not
[1:19:29] jealous but you'll refrain praise or you
[1:19:32] won't give a compliment you won't
[1:19:33] acknowledge it somebody shows you their
[1:19:36] nice engagement ring you're like nice
[1:19:39] setting right did you hear I was engaged
[1:19:42] to what right I'm not
[1:19:46] jealous but you're going to get
[1:19:47] congratulations from
[1:19:51] me you can't rejoice when other people
[1:19:53] are used by God becomes a
[1:19:56] competition it's the gains of
[1:19:59] Kora it is the pride of life it's the
[1:20:02] sin of
[1:20:05] popularity I think enough has been said
[1:20:07] on this subject but let me just close it
[1:20:08] by saying the big
[1:20:11] three will use sin the World the Flesh
[1:20:13] the
[1:20:14] devil to dilute us to deceive us to
[1:20:19] distract us and ultimately it's trying
[1:20:20] to destroy us say Lord I want my eyes to
[1:20:24] be open opened to how these work on me
[1:20:26] as an individual how they work within
[1:20:28] our families and how they become
[1:20:30] problems in the church how they can
[1:20:33] become problematic within the the larger
[1:20:35] community of the message of the
[1:20:37] hour if you see somebody that you feel
[1:20:39] or some something you see you recognize
[1:20:41] certain things going on out there in the
[1:20:43] world today or amongst certain people
[1:20:45] whether it be false prophecies or false
[1:20:47] movements whatever it might be then you
[1:20:49] know where it's coming from I said God
[1:20:51] have mercy on these people God have
[1:20:53] mercy on that Minister God
[1:20:55] uh uh keep me uh put me in a place Lord
[1:20:58] where I I can stay clean put I let the
[1:21:00] blood cover me in these things as
[1:21:01] brother bam said and Lord help those
[1:21:04] that may be getting distracted pulled
[1:21:05] aside by these things because it's a
[1:21:07] it's in these three things all that is
[1:21:10] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[1:21:12] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:21:13] money women and popularity it's in
[1:21:16] everything that would deceive us
[1:21:18] distract us or try to destroy us may God
[1:21:20] give us Grace and his blood cover us and
[1:21:23] keep us covered up so that we can be
[1:21:25] Victorious and our hearts not be lifted
[1:21:28] up unto our destruction if you could
[1:21:30] stand with me
