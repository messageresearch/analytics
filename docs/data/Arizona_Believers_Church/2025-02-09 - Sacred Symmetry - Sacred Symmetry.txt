TRANSCRIPT
========================================
1 Peter chapter 1 verses 14 and 16 to 16 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy amen he's called us he who has called us is Holy so we are to be holy in all manner of conversation says because it is written drawn from scripture be holy for I am Holy you can take your seats you can see from our slide that we're going to be speaking on sacred Symmetry and this will you might be playing with that phrase a little bit and trying to figure out in your mind what it means uh but we'll come to it here in just a moment but if you could turn in your Bibles to Psalms 103:7 I'm going to use this just to connect what we were ministering on Wednesday night to this morning service says of the Lord he made way he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel the ways there is a road or path it would speak of maybe a direction or just a journey and it's also used of manner a habit or a course of Life a moral character and he says he made known his ways unto Moses and we can say this but only his acts unto the children of Israel so his ways were made known to the prophet made known to Moses and this was his character his who he was and his habit as course of life and what the children of Israel saw were things that God had done and we use the example Wednesday night on the difference between the artwork and the work of art whereas one is the product that would be the artwork or you look at it and you could view it and then the the work of art would be the process or skill of creating art as was fellowship with Brother Scott my our local Latin expert on how to properly pronounce the Latin um RS and that's what the root is for art and it basically begins to uh emphasize that fun foundational aspect of creative skill that's what that word means art it's a skill and it's that it forms the basis of someone if they're an artist or art kind of refers to this aspect of a creation or a skill in creating and the artistic process if we're thinking about a work of art the product of a process but the process itself is the ability to express and to innovate and to create through various mediums and so there's we've been focusing maybe a lot on painting and the visual arts but there's other ways that art can be expressed uh it involves many different facets of the Mastery of certain techniques and the application of that creativity I can tell you I could dream up a million things in my mind but to be able to put it on paper and make it happen that takes real skill or an artist and there's this continual honing of those abilities an artist can be a musical artist is someone who could be talented or learned or gifted in certain ways but there's a if you're the process the artistic process is the continual honing of those gifts and those particular traits and these things work together and they produce these works that will resonate uh with people and there it causes a contemplation and it has some sort of effect on the viewer so of the things we pointed out if there's a uh in the artistic process artistic process that there is a way of perceiving there's this discernment of abilities there's this recognition of slight differences which give something their character and their expression sometimes you hear somebody who's able to impersonate voices and uh uh and sound like someone else what they do is they can perceive some particular distinction in someone's tone or the way that they speak and all you do is emphasize that it kind of brings it to life oh you sound just like that person or that you act just like them and that's that skill that someone could have an art to perceive a character and expressions and that's all part of the artistic process but the artwork itself is just the outcome of that skill of creativity it is the it is the actual expression of that Innovation and when we look at that in that vein if we look at the Psalms 103:7 he made known his ways unto Moses in other words God revealed to Moses the work of God the mind the process uh the inspiration of God whereas the children of Israel only saw God's work I think it's very simple but you see the distinction that's being made when one would show you their mind or show you their their process this would involve some sort of inspiration or Revelation it's a deeper Insight whereas the other one could just merely be emotion oh wow that's beautiful oh that's that that's a gorgeous painting and so to know the way of God is greater than just to see the works of God Jesus chastised himself saying you see my works but you don't know who I am I can do all these wonderful things and all you come is you come for the bread and you come for the Miracles but you haven't really heard me you don't really know me so in Psalms 25:4 this is our prayer show me thy ways oh Lord teach me thy paths I show me the way and teach me your path I want to know the right way to walk I want to know the right manner of life I want to know the right way to live amen uh brother Reggie shared a quote uh early Thursday morning from the sermon be certain of God that just fit perfectly with this I thought it would just be an outstanding statement to share today Lord as brother BR is praying at the very outset Lord bless Thy word as it goes forth and may the Holy Spirit capture our minds and our thoughts and prepare us for his visitation as we have asked him to come for we do not come to the house of the Lord to be seen or to see but to learn of thee and to know of thy nature and thy way and thy causes think of just how how rich that is we don't come to church just to see and be seen but we come to learn from the Lord and in learning we want to know his nature we want to know his way and we want to know his causes we want to know what he's for we want to know what he's doing it says that we might be able to face the problems of life with a real Assurance being certain of god notice how if we're facing something going through something whatever it is that we might have as our our real burden right now that what we want to know is his nature his way and his causes and that'll give us greater courage and wisdom to face the problems of life when you have an assurance of who God is truly the more you would know about God the less you'd worry about everything else that's going on right I mean the more that you knew him and knew his love for you and knew his nature and knew how kind he's been the more you could just remember how he's never failed you and everything has always worked together for the good the less you would probably worry about the problems of life so we come this morning to learn of the Lord to know his nature his ways and his causes which brings us to the subject this morning of sacred symmetry when I use the term sacred it's drawing from some of the elements that we spoke on last month but those things which are holy if something sacred it's set apart uh the Sabbath was to be kept uh sacred that means they set it apart just a regular day uh for for the Jews but then once they set it apart it became a holy day so something set apart so sacredness is something separate and I'm using the word symmetry to speak of some harmonious Arrangement where there is these uh uh these balanced proportions and if there's any artist here whether it be musically or or uh painting or writers um even within math if there's any mathematicians here or maist whatever they're called uh they'll be they'll recognize this that there's this beauty of form and that there is a as it's called Divine proportion that exist maybe it's it's debatable and different people argue it so I'm not leaning into it too much but it's this idea that beauty is expressed in these balanced proportions uh that when something has symmetry to it and that certain form uh there's a way that it just catches the eye and it draws the viewer in and so there is a sacred or a holy Beauty and that's what we're looking at is this this Holiness that conveys and presents an engaging Beauty in First Peter chap 1: 14 15 and 16 as we read it uh earlier says as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance so there's some fashioning some making some uh outworking that's taking place and when we were ignorant we looked like the world we lived like the world we did worldly things but now being obedient to the word of God and having been born again we now are not fashioned the same way so there's a different life that we begin to live and so he puts it in these terms but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy it's a the one who called you God who is Holy has called you and he having called you it's we must also be holy as the one who's called us and it says in all coners manner of conversation now that includes our literal conversation it includes the things that we talk about but it speaks all to all that would Encompass your manner of life it's your daily Behavior we could say in all our conduct and conversations so it kind of draws in that there's this responsibility that I have in every fa facet of my life to not convey the wrong picture to not uh present the wrong things and to do my best to uh to express the nature of Christ and the Holiness of God when he says because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy Peter is pulling from this principle that God is Holy and he points to the context of the law in Leviticus 11:44 for I am the Lord your God you shall therefore sanctify yourselves and you shall be holy for I am Holy neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now God has giving these instructions under the law and he's actually giving them away that they can meet the requirements of the law though as difficult as it would be he's telling them that you're to sanctify yourselves to separate be set apart avoid certain things because I'm holy and being holy you need to be holy as my people and then it says then do not defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth speaking of avoiding things that are unclean and if some of you want to get maybe ahead of where I'm going I've been looking at if something's unclean it's impure and you'll find that's connected with things that are abomination in the scripture there's different ways that it's an Abomination there's different things that can be an Abomination it's quite a a lengthy study but that's what he's dealing with here is those things that are an Abomination saying uh you you want to avoid those things that are unclean avoid those things that are impure so that you can be separate as God is separate and he's drawing a parallel of the Holiness of God a and how it was demonstrated in the law that in the law God has given them very specific things to do so that they can guard their sanctification so that they could stay pure now I I will say this that the the the laws and the things that were given and even those things that were called an Abomination it's not just making a list and saying all these things are evil and if you do these things you don't have the Holy Ghost but God was specifically governing their lives with very detailed things that they were to avoid and abstain from and it didn't necessarily make make those things in themselves evil or impure but it was ways that they could sanctify themselves and keep themselves pure then when we come into the New Testament as hopefully we'll find uh later on or we can get more in depth that there's things that are directly related to the nature of God that remain in Abomination even after the law and so there God's nature and character the this Holiness of God is is there's a an maybe this is a bad word to use but there's an attempt or there's a symbolism and a type of God's holiness that's demonstrated in the law and Peter's using that as an example of the Holiness that we ought to have now so God is Holy we must be holy in Malachi chapter 3 starting with verse 5 and we'll read verse 6 also God says I'll come near to you to judgment and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and those that oppress the hireling in his wages the Widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the Lord of host now there's quite a bit here and I I I'm hoping that at some point maybe today I uh this morning in this service I can come back to this but notice he says I'm going to be a swift witness I'm going to judge Sorcerers I'm going to judge adulterers I'm going to judge those who falsely swear and those that oppress the employees that oppress the widows and the fatherless and that turn away the stranger from his right and he's saying that in doing these things now God says he's going to judge these these are all things that maybe might be good for us to think about Ponder a little bit and ask ourselves why would God judge people who do these things and then he says in verse 6 for I am the Lord I change not that's right says therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed this is something that I'm wanting to emphasize now that the Bible says be ye holy as I am Holy and we're looking at a god whose nature does not change I am the Lord I change not it kind of has a root to be repeated or to repeat again or to do again but it also means in the emphasis here is I do not I am not altered I do not it even speaks to I do not disguise myself so he's not trying to deceive uh he he is not a a dissimilation where he does things one way and it has a particular nature and then he acts contrary to his nature I am the Lord and I change not and he's saying just because I have not executed judgment on the wicked does not mean I've changed my ways this is to me this is a a key because we say well they get away with this I got away with this this keeps happening this keeps happening this is the way things are just because things have changed and things are accepted and a a way of life seems to be continuing on without any sense of judgment God says I am the Lord and I do not change my attitude towards this I have an unchangeable hatred of sin a a and I am going to judge these things the very fact that I have not executed judgment upon it does not mean I've changed my opinion but at the same time my longsuffering has not changed either I am the Lord I change not I will judge that sin but I since I don't change the sons of Jacob are not consumed because long suffering God never changes in his nature he's always doing his work the same now the work may look different but it's got to be in continuity with his nature he he he he does these great works he does things he accomplishes things but it's all according to his nature as I've been drawing from those sermons in 1964 uh on the Masterpiece identified Masterpiece which were all preceded by the identified Christ of all ages and God being identified in his characteristics he says and the identified Christ of all ages you see all these things just portrayed Christ Old Testament prophets and David and these ones he was a part of it God does not change his nature does not change his character does not change thank God ours does he is still the word and Malachi 3:6 proves that what is it I am the Lord and I change not he just changes his form form for each age now catch that how that uh that can strike us well he changes his form we think well it would be better if he always appeared as a triangle uh that was on fire and there's this hovering orb of a triangular fire and we'd say well that's God that's the form that he holds but yet he's saying no I don't do that I I'll change my form but to know me you have to know my ways and recognize a form that is revealing or exhibiting my nature or my character each age he has allotted a part of the word which has been prophesied would happen in certain days and as that age comes along God just moves in another form it's God all the time the word the word made flesh and dwelt among us as we live in this 21st century then there's going to be a 21st century word that's going to take on form in this hour and it's going to be the way nature and character of God the same as it's always been in that form the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever when the word was made flesh in Jesus Christ his divine nature his Divine personality did not change by becoming flesh in Jesus Christ even though he took on a form of a man and maybe took on a form in a way that he had not done previously he did not change his nature he was the same as he ever was before that's why Jesus could say I've been with you this long you've seen me and and through seeing me in this form in this life that I've lived you've been seeing the father brother brandham writes this in the church age book chapter one and I think it's very uh it's part of that where Satan hates Revelation and he knows when the chur true church gets the true revelation of the of herself that she'll be an invincible Army but this this paragraph precedes it let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and he changes not th this is such a critical uh thing to understand he's the same yesterday today and forever and as I've been this is what I've been kind of looking at this whole year on this thought is that we could then take God and put him in a particular image and force that image and say this is the way that it would be because God never changes and try to carry that through every age but God is saying no my nature never changes the image may change but the image will not be broadcasting something that's contrary to my nature may come in a different expression or a different form but I'm the same yesterday today and forever and I change not the devil would want you to think that God does change I had a friend who preached a sermon one time called the uh unchanging yet everchanging God and it was shown that there's certain things that will never change but then there's a way in that that unchanging nature is shown he says he knows a whole lot more than the 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways it's in his nature in his character if he's immutable in his nature then the way that his nature is expressed it's also immutable it's that Telltale sign that it's God sometimes I express it this way I I love looking into my life and seeing the Fingerprints of God all over it and to maybe the world or the critic would think well why does that look like God to you wouldn't have God just kept it from happening why why would that how is that God wouldn't it just been better if if if this would have never happen or if it happened this way but there's a way that God's nature when you could see that he's doing something so God is unchanging in his nature he's immutable in his ways that's that principle of God and so God is Holy he is sacred this is one of those immutable characteristics this is part of his unchanging nature he is sacred he's set apart there's this this apartness this consecration this Sanctified God is Holy and it's hard for us to think that God is Sanctified but he is in essence originally no evil inside of him no darkness no lying God is Holy and unchangeable in Exodus chapter 15 ver1 it says who is like unto thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders he's Majestic in his sacredness in his separateness in the most simple way to look at it something holy is something that's set apart I know we attach a lot of things to what Holiness is and we might begin to ascribe a certain piety or maybe some rigid construct in our minds and it's certainly fine because it's the way that we understand what holy means but something's holy it's set apart God God is Holy he's sacred he's aart he's he's not like human beings he's not the way he he is not sinful flesh he's higher he's greater he's holy he's Majestic in his sacredness and in Hebrews 12: 10-15 and we'll read a number of scriptures that speak to this there is a call to be one with God in this Majestic sacredness in this glorious holiness in Hebrews 12: 10-15 for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure who's that our fathers who spank us who correct us who chastised us but he God corrects us for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness so God uses correction and chastisement for our benefit for our edification that we might be a partner or these Partners in his Holiness Holiness here is that sanctity this moral purity and it's this idea of this absolute Holiness this absolute sanctification so there's a continual work of uh chastisement and instruction and teaching that we might become greater Partners in his Holiness I we can say partakers but I wouldn't want you to think of it just like you taste it and you kind of involved or interacted with but now you're a partner in his Holiness says now chaste no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby so as God uses his word to instruct us to discipline us to teach us his ways and to show him show us his paths then it may not feel good at the time and sermons that are very direct and address certain things that are lacking in our lives we may not like it at the time and it's important to recognize that if somebody starts getting into your home a little bit and pointing out things that are wrong as the word Goes Forth and the Holy Spirit begins to discern things that are lacking in your life you might immediately get uh uh offended by the person that's saying it I know you all thinking he's conditioning us it's coming well I don't know it might be and and it's it's understandable that you might first get offended you might try to figure out well they just said that because of this or even think well that doesn't really matter and and that kind of initial reaction is fine because it's kind of that working out of that grieving but when we take it and we begin to Bear it and we say I'm not just going to run because I've been corrected or I'm not just going to throw it away I'm going to really take this to heart and it'll find that as it begins to work in your heart it yields that fruit that God was looking for because the teaching the instruction the discipline the chastening was exercised it was fruitful and profitable in your life so he says wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and this is a key scripture here and make straight paths for your feet now notice this it's not it's not so much uh correcting the record of things ped a and and making sure everything is right in your past but it has something to do with going forward there is a a statement uh brother Eli I don't know if you're familiar with this but there's a statement that us Cowboy fans have that the owner Jerry Jones is only interested in being right not winning it's all that matters to him is being right he's not interested in winning and when we think about teaching and correction and Chas a lot of times our initial reaction is we want to wrestle with it so that we can be perceived to be right in our prior conduct but we're not thinking about future conduct in other words if we respond to the sense of well this was okay that was okay I was I wasn't really wrong then we're actually saying I'm going to continue to do the things I've always been doing in the future and will'll keep making the same mistakes and doing the same thing getting the same results so Paul says make straight paths for your feet lest that way which is lamed be turned excuse me that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed what a beautiful statement you make the path straight for your feet so that the lame will be healed it's one way of reading it they won't be turned out of the way so it says in verse 14 follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root a bit is springing up trouble you and therefore thereby many be defiled so a lot that we could go through in this it originally had a much larger reading Here If You Can Read More in Hebrews chapter 12 you'll find that these things fit together very nicely but he says as we are to be partakers or Partners in his Holiness that we ought to in light of these things follow Holiness in other words we're to be continually putting on Holiness through a process of continued sanctification through this process of separateness and let me say this this is our primary objective as it says follow peace with all men and Holiness it's not saying that we are to follow peace with all men and therefore it's necessary that we compromise following peace with all men is not permission to compromise with or become wi one with the world or become in harmony with the world oh follow peace with all men well I become this to this person I become that to that person and use this as that that's our primary objective is to be at peace or in harmony with all men that's not what's being expressed Paul says in Galatians 1:10 for do I now persuade men or God do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ so when it the instruction is to follow peace with all men and Holiness it is not a harmony with the world but it is a there is this thought that's being expressed that we're to not be fighting and contentious and continually engaging uh uh in this acrimony with men and the world and even Believers but we're to follow peace with all men and primarily to follow Holiness and this is done to fulfill verses 13 and 15 that if we're not following Holiness then we're not going to be able to accomplish the scriptures here in verse 13 and 15 Romans 14: 19 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another we are we are not called to be compromisers we're not called to fit in with the world but we're not called to make war with people we're not called to make war with other people who have different ideas and so there is this Holiness there is this righteous indignation that would come with that there is this separateness but in all this separation and all this Holiness where there's there to never be this looking down upon there's to never be this arrogance or I'm better than you or this persecution I say it many times uh that the the you say the elect won't persecute elect is the statement that we believe and and the thing to me that's at the heart of that when we say elect will not persecute elect that is an easy conclusion since the elect will not persecute anyone and if I'm not in the habit of persecuting everyone else then I'm certainly not going to make the mistake of persecuting the elect but there is a another side to this wherein if we're going to follow peace with all men we can kind of create this caricature of a Christian who kind of just fits in he's kind of cool he he he he kind of he's embraced he's accepted but we are to not make that kind of Peace but follow after things which make peace and things which will edify why vers 13 make straight paths for your feet looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God Holiness then is a way of life and it's a it Holiness is making our way of life plain you say you have the nature of Christ inside of you you're Christians his it's God that dwells on the inside of you then this Holiness this separateness now there's very specific things that relate to that but if we could just think of it in this General context that this uh name that's given that we're using is Holiness but now let me look at it the other way there's this way of life that a Christian begins to engage in this manner in this pattern that begins to take on a certain nature that shows a certain character and that is what Holiness is it's not so it's I'm wanting to look at it maybe from the top uh from the bottom up it's saying well these are the things that we do and this is this is that process of Holiness we're not beginning with Holiness we're not beginning well we're holy well no there's our righteousness is filthy rags there's nothing inherent in humanity that's holy but the spirit of God is Holy and now what it begins to do is work inside of us and those fruits that it begins to produce and this manner of life that it begins to produce when it is the holy spirit that is holiness though our paths is a it's a way of life our way of life should be identifiable our paths are to be made straight it says so that the lame or those that are weak in faith are not stumbled our path our life ought to be identifiable it ought to be clear it we say it should be a holy life but it should be a life that indicates an apartness a separate so that those that are weak in faith and even the unbeliever the lame and different ones could see and say that is different that is set apart Amen in Proverbs 4: 26 and 27 it says Ponder the path of thy feet make my path straight so some of the septu I think maybe renders it in a different some translations Ponder the the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established think about where you're going have the Lord teach you his paths show you his ways that you might walk in a plain path make straight the paths of your feet turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from Evil remember how God says in Malachi 3 that he would bring judgment upon those that oppress and that turn aside the stranger from his right that there is a manner of Life which can cause others to turn aside that the lame be turned out of the way if our path isn't straight great if we as Christians and and uh Believers this is something I've thought of and if this sounds like an indictment of myself that's fine uh confession is good for the soul but I think find it remarkable sometimes when the longer that we serve God the less AP part we become the more comfortable we kind of get in our call in our election and we feel really confident that we're Believers and so that that line that used to be so distinct we just kind of move it a little bit move it a little bit because we've contined in this we're still serving God I'm still here we've made it through all these ups and downs and abusive Ministries and people falling away I'm still here but yet our part and our separateness is becoming more and more blurred and what is that to indicate to our children what does that indicate to the the the the one that's weakened their faith and they're pining for Holiness they're Desiring deliverance and you're over there saying man I'd get over that that doesn't really matter that much there's just a way that worldliness can begin to seep in I was thinking about it here recently and um there is a a lot of academic research a lot of numbers crunching there's a lot of test and studies that are being done to determine uh what's the best way uh to to fight drug trade and drug trafficking and the and there is an argument and and we may defer to our uh local expert on this later to where it would be better with certain drugs to just legalize them regulate them and make them readily available number one you could get tax dollars off of it you could then regulate it and you could Mo uh moderate certain things and and in my mind I wonder well where do where would some Believers go who've always used this rationale that it's not illegal to indulge H how many preachers are going to be doing a line of coke before they come out to preach right because they've been able to justify all these other things in their lives because it was legal this is legal it's it's it's not illegal to do this and so there's this blurring of lines think about the paths of your feet think about the way that you're going don't turn to the right or to the left remove thy foot from Evil these are very general prescriptions we'd say well okay that we want to follow a plain path and then the debate is what is a plain path we want to avoid evil then what is evil it says make straight paths for your feet that actually the word is the wheel the Wheel tracks the tracks that a will is to follow in make straight the paths of your feet it's a firm walk in the right direction and when you do that you establish a plain way the way that you're living isn't deviating and confusing and hypocritical you're not super legalist about this and it doesn't really matter H and then completely full-blown Freedom over here in something that does matter and so someone who's trying to follow you is like I don't even know which way to go one minute this is wrong and then you say that's right I'm thinking that's what really looks wrong but then you're and it's just this wandering back and forth make plain your way of life it it's a different Wheel track than the world there may be points of intersection there may be times when it appears as if you're traveling the same direction we hop in our cars and we drive to work and we travel down the same road that everyone else does we show up at an office with a lot of other people and our lives in so many ways have these parallel tracks to the world but what ought to make us difference is the nature and the way that we're living that there's a life that I can live even amongst my Associates at work or in school and in my family and and the larger world and the community as we engage in others on vacation or at the mall whatever it might be that my life my nature and my way indicates and shows a different path and notice how it says this follow Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord we could take them together follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord let me say it this way and just think about this I think we're getting pretty close uh pretty close to the Finish see my second page it says without Holiness no man shall see the Lord I want to put it that way without Holiness no man shall see the Lord the Hebrews have a saying to see God is to enjoy him here's just a moving phrase to see God is to enjoy him so if you have see if you thought you saw God but didn't there wasn't some pleasure and enjoyment from it then you didn't see him you might have seen a fearful work you might have seen a Wonder but to see God is to enjoy him amen amen and I want to take this statement and just use it in a little bit different way we know that without Holiness no man will be meeting the Lord in the air we know that without Holiness that uh we cannot uh we cannot enter into the New Jerusalem but look at this from a little bit different perspective I don't believe it to be a stretch but unless the sacred is being lived in US unless the Divine is being lived in this profane then no man will ever be able to see God if we were to uh hypothetically say that the only Christians that existed in the world today were sitting on the front row then there would be there would be God's design in nature there would be certain things that would maybe indicate a a divine plan and design it would be things that we could look at and say God has revealed in these things that are seen But to see God today would be the life that he would be living in these two brother Joel brother Rowan would be the ones through which we would have the greatest opportunity to see God and if their lives were not in the nature and the way of God which is holy and if their lives weren't lived in a way where there was some apartness there was some separateness then we would never see God so there must be a separate way of life there must be a separate way of thinking and acting and talking and responding that gives some indication that Divine Nature's present amen amen unless Christ is living in someone today then no man no one will see the Lord oh oh I'm going to quickly go through maybe several scriptures here so we could wrap up um as soon as possible in Isaiah chapter 35:8 it says and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the elect the Holy One uh some translations take it to say the Holy One will be with them walking in the way but it shall be for those and it says the wayfaring men though fools should not he therein it's a lot to process in this statement and as it speaks to even more perfectly future times this says there will be a highway it's elevated it's above a way of Holiness again that's that distance this course of Journey but then it speaks of manner of life and habit moral character Direction when we say something is trending down we usually go oh no that's not good right because there's this directional association with things that are going up things that are going down and so here it says the way a direction a way of life a course of conduct a a habit there's going to be a habit of Holiness there's going to be a way of Holiness a separateness the unclean the defiled the impure will not be able to pass it's a separate way in Acts 24:14 Paul says but this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believ in all things which are written in the law and in the prophets this way may be foolish to the world this way that we're going may seem to be wrong but in order for the world to perceive it is wrong it must be undeniably plain think of that it must be as the Bible says and I think it's something to really wrestle with uh that you know that that the wayfaring men though fools should not air therein a language suggests that it's going to be so PL that not even a fool could miss it it's going to be so obvious that not even a fool would would know would think it was the same way as everything else so whether or not the fool would take the way is not the question or whether or not the world thinks you're a fool for taking it the qu the the idea that's being at the minimum presented is that there's a way of life that is so distinct and different from the human way of life that others recognize that's aart that is separate amen there's a way of Holiness that we're called to that ought to be plain so undeniably plain that even the lame can walk in it and be healed that the weak in faith will see the Wheel tracks so that the believer will not falter even though they may be called a fool though it may be a way that's called heresy again there's what's become uh what's I've been helped with personally over the last few months in studying this is to recognize that because there's this idea that if it's if the world is gonna if the world hates you you know you're doing you're doing something right and then yet there's this other side where it's like the world needs to see and they will know and they will recognize but those things as it relates to the time that we're living in now and the scriptures that are applicable to the time we're living now it doesn't mean that in recognizing it they're going to be like wow this is the way we all want to be so there is but there must be a distinction and a separation that even the fool could say yeah that's different they're not like the world brother Bram in the sermon sir we would see Jesus says our citizenship is of above he uses this phrase citizen quite a bit when he's using this principle and that's a habitant of a particular City so we're not Phoenicians we're not prian uh we're not Glend delians we are Christians meaning we're citizens of a holy city our citizenship is above and above is Holiness and Purity and Power in Revelation therefore we are citizens of the kingdom of God there shall be a highway this this just means something elevated something above so we think directionally if it's above this is something my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts this is something above and where the above is it's holy it's pure it's powerful that's where Revelation is there shall be an elevated path and if that gets into some sort of hierarchy and tries to make ourselves humanly better than somebody else then we could just say it's a parallel path but it's distinctly different it's separate in 1 Thessalonians 4:7 for God hath not called us to unto uncleanness but unto Holiness sanctification consecration purification of our hearts of our thoughts of Our Lives he has not called us to impurity to mixing but to Holiness in 1 John 3:2 to three beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not appear yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we we shall see him as he is what a promise what with a great precious promise and to those of us who have this promise every man that ha hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure it's another way of saying put on Holiness as he is Holy it purify it means to cleanse or to make pure from carnality to become chased or modest even suggest to be immaculately clean so listen Brothers there's a way that we can clean house in our minds honey clean the house and the wife and the daughter would look at him be like you're joking right like you really didn't clean the house did you like oh you do that no you do that no that's what goes into this and you begin to realize there there's a clean in in the ways of men and there's a clean in the ways of women who are primarily tasked with that and it's fine if we become more engaged in that as men I even bought a book on it like there's things that are just intuitive to women and you're like I need to read up on this and so there is the same thing with God there's this CLE cleanliness that he desires to see in our lives that there's a way of loving there's a way of living there's a way of correcting there's a way of of going about life that he wants to see and it's a cleanness I know that there's a way that we can view Christianity that's very auster and rigid and harsh and cruel but don't make make the mistake that Holiness is fearful and for boing and and damaging and cruel and imposing that's not it at all there's a way that God wants you to live a separate life that is actually attracted to those who are looking for God looking for love looking for something they can belong to and it's that wrong image of Holiness that has caused many to run away and has become abusive because they saw the works but didn't know the way and if we knew his way that we could understand how we can live apart from uncleanness and aspired to Holiness and pure ourselves purify ourselves as he is pure Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on the new man this new man is like God he's created by God which after God which like God is created in righteousness and true Holiness God having not been created when he brought you forth as a new creature and New Creation in Christ Jesus he brought you forth in righteousness and true Holiness not the artwork but in the process of the art with the nature the life the character 1 Thessalonians 3:13 to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in Holiness before God even our father at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints the word Saints there is often it's from the same derivative of Holiness the Holy One is translated to the the word for Holiness is translated the Holy One to Saints this is some people who are separate and set apart and to establish that he may to this purpose to this goal establish your hearts unblamable in Holiness before God and we all said well great I quit but listen Holiness comes by the Holy Spirit and this Holy Spirit which God has created You by this baptism of the Holy Ghost he's created you in righteousness and true Holiness and this Holiness comes by the Holy Spirit but it's interrupted by influences it's interrupted by the influences of humanity and the world and Satan and so he's saying that we want to be established in this unblamable in Holiness so where there's this continual putting on the new man this is how it says in Romans 1:4 I think this will help us in terms of understanding how we're our hearts are be unblamable in Holiness and declared to be the Son of God with power speaking of Jesus Christ he's declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness the spirit of Holiness is his divine nature in ourselves we do not as humans have a spirit of Holiness we do not have divine nature by natural birth or by discipline but the spirit of Holiness which is divine nature is power it is the spirit of Holiness it's the author of The Holiness in the Holiness of in The Believer it's the beginner of that creation it's the beginner of your faith it's the spirit of Holiness and as he is Holy and he has given you the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wants to operate to bring into you this continual expression in manner of life which is separate and apart from the world I I think we're doing I think we're doing okay on time I I'm going to say this I ask God to give me to help me uh with expressing this when I began to look at these things the Lord began to do with my heart some time ago maybe it's been over the last couple years uh there was and it probably goes back further than that even in starting a church from scratch there's a lot of things you begin to uh look at and ask yourself well you know how many things do we do just because this is what somebody else did and is this the way that it ought to be done which way did brother brandham actually teach it so there's a lot of growing in that process and I began to try to look I was looking into the word of God to find uh you know what are the things that we can hold on to as absolutes that tell us how to live and how to act and what that would look like today and in my mind I don't believe I ever approach this with the thought that I will be able to look into this and immediately begin to justify playing the lottery or being able to go to horse races and my goodness there's so many good casinos around here and you know Vegas is just a short drive there wasn't like this idea that if I could somehow get to the core of things I could justify a lot of uh carnal things in my life or somebody else's life or give reason to say hey guys just love Jesus and uh and then let's just come back here next Sunday that I I didn't approach it with that idea but I realized the more I read this the more narrow my view of what liberties we should take became that the more I began to think wow there's there this is there's not a lot of attitude to just do as we want and say that this is kind of the gray area or that well what's good for you is not necessarily good for me and that's okay if your family does that but as for me in my house we don't believe in that that you'd realize there's this dividing line The more I've studied The more I've looked at it the more I've realized wow there is a nature and a way of God that presents itself and manifest itself and there's clear deviations from that and if we're not walking in the truth the beauty of God has never seen there's something that's dissimilar there's something that's not symmetrical in the way that we're living according to the word in Psalms 29:2 now I got to hurry give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness this had in the Hebrew it's this adornment or Glory it comes from this some Splendor and Majesty so it's a beauty which is intrinsic when it says the the beauty of Holiness that means this beauty is not shallow it's not the Holiness of the the Pharisees that could act in a way that set them apart but that's not that's not a beauty that's kind of a forced contrived separateness that's what cultist behavior is and that's where we could say brother Joel and brother Rowen were the only two that had God inside of them and so the only way we can see God is through their lives and they're like man we're the only two on Earth let's go in the middle of nowhere off the land a and just get a satellite and we could code from here and make a lot of money and we never need to go into the world and guess what the world is going to be pure dark no faith to Faith No No shining of the light so the beauty of Holiness that Holiness is apartness sacredness separateness comes from the Hebrew kadash to consecrate to sanctify to prepare to dedicate to be Sanctified or to be separate to show oneself sacred carries the idea of majesty or Royal it's a distinguishing characteristic which signifies Great Value not just shallow but deep there's a beauty of this world which is only skin deep there's a beauty of this world which is Vanity there's this beauty of the world which can literally be washed away there's this Christian comedian I guess he was at a youth camp might have been a Pentecostal Youth Camp I remember uh some friends of mine playing it for me that he's at a youth camp and he said that he was describing that date with the girl and he said uh that they're sitting at dinner and she rolled his eyes her eyes at him and he rolled them right back her eye she didn't have an eye and they're driving and her hair was blowing in the wind as he drove in the convertible he had to turn around and go pick it back up and everything was basically just this there was nothing to this woman she was her eyes weren't real her hair wasn't real you know it just kept going on down the line someone's laughing hard enough I think they've heard it before maybe it was Louisiana Youth Camp I don't know but there's a there's is there's a fake Beauty to put on that you could just take all the parts away but right but there's this beauty of Holiness Psalms 969 oh Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him all the Earth this is that sacred symmetry that I'm thinking about is there's a beauty symmetry speaks of beauty and things are proportional things are right and things are true and and that's a real Beauty and there's a holy Beauty it's the actual beauty of Holiness to where we can say instead of a a a Holiness that is beautiful or that there's a h h the beauty a holy Beauty the beauty of Holiness Holiness has a symmetry Holiness H has a has something it's expressing that is greatly beautiful now if I could just take a few more moments I'd like to read Deuteronomy 17 ver excuse me Deuteronomy 17:1 I have just one more scripture and a couple more quotes to read to you Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bulock or sheep where in his blemish or any evil favored if you're looking in your Bible you'll find that my slideshow is not lacking for spaces that is one word evil favored for that is an abomination of the Lord thy God now pick up on that evil favored is an Abomination to the lord it's not being prescribed that this is something I'm telling you by the law that you should avoid I'm telling you that as God this is my attitude as God this is my nature this is what I value evil favored this is something that lacks Beauty the beauty of symmetry evil favor is something that's deformed or ugly an Abomination is something that's disgusting detestable something that God abhor evil favored an unpleasant or unattractive condition or appearence in a moral sense it'd be marked by moral or spiritual corruption so it's an outward expression of unbelief or wickedness that Mar God's image in humanity that so in the sacrifice if one was bringing a bulock or a sheep that had a blemish or had some sort of birth defect say this is to be a sacrifice it's to be expressing something something it's foreshadowing something and that wouldn't be that's not according to my image that's not what I'm wanting this whole this thing to present I mean think about God in terms of the temple the Tabernacle the sacrifices even the construction God didn't just tell Moses L listen just build a just build something in a place where you can sacrifice and and that that would be easy just build a place that you can sacrifice and man could do the best they can but God says I want you to I want a Golden Triangle I want you to use this these ratios I want you to use this here I want you use that and he's so detailed and particular about all of it because it conveys something about God evil favored then is this outward expression that changes the image of God in the person evil favored is an Abomination to the Lord just as it is in the sacrifice of a bulock and a sheep it is in the sacrifice of our lives in what we're offering to him the way we're living the way we're talking the way we're dressing the way we're indulging and identified Christ of all ages it says beauty is of the devil always it's a false conception of the devil admits the beauty of the Lord in Holiness and power so there's a beauty of the Lord in Holiness and power not in paint and powder and shorts and everything else that they're trying to wear and do do it I think we've read that uh sometime recently there's a beauty of the Lord which is in Holiness and power not paint powder shorts and everything that tries to use a perversion of beauty an enticement woman in the garden saw something as beautiful but it was a perversion of the original design it wasn't as it was originally intended to be viewed but she was caused to be deceived to perceive something is beautiful and desirable that wasn't it's in the beauty of Holiness and righteousness we are not of this world we are from a kingdom that's above where dwelleth righteousness within and he says they the world they don't Adorn themselves with that too much television and so forth I'm glad for the so forth because TV doesn't exist anymore too much influence and Interruption that we're to have our hearts established unblamable in Holiness according to the spirit of Holiness because we've been created in righteousness and true Holiness and we're to be putting on the new man and purifying ourselves and being holy as he is Holy but in comes the interruption of influences of humanity the world society events you name it and it's robbing us of the beauty of Holiness the power of Holiness he says speaking of America in the sermon God identifying himself by his characteristics anybody who's kind of taken the lead on listening to some of these sermons I have uh I have a choice when I say if you want a listening list uh let me know I have a choice to believe that only the these are the only ones that want to listen to it the ones that ask or everybody got else got it and they know exactly what I want to listen to these are the only ones who didn't know and had to ask so it's a kind of a litmus test he's speaking of America he said it's supposed to be a Christian Nation but the spirit of this nation is not Christian it might be called a Christian but it's a million miles from it in characteristic don't believe the hype to quote flavor flave don't believe the hype I'm telling you no matter how much it may seem that there's some sort of moral correction taking place in America it's a false Beauty it's a False Image he's speaking of a conversation he had with his wife she said well we aren't we all Americans I said no we live here this is our country we stay in it we love it it's the best nation in the world but yet we're not Americans wow what does this do to the Maga movement so are you saying we're aliens I mean we we can be documented Americans but where's your documentation that you're citizens of a holy city some of us are undocumented aliens in church Glory where's your holy documentation I need a ham and be three behind me now it's the best nation in the world but we're not Americans I said we are born from above the Holy Spirit come down and we belong to a kingdom it's not of this world I said that's the reason our sisters wear dresses wear long hair don't wear makeup their characteristics identify them as Holiness unto the Lord from above I will say this these things are in aable characteristics of the Sacred in women today we can trifle with it we can argue with it we can say well this applies and this doesn't apply but let me say there is a way of God in the word which is immutable and it never changes and no matter how long we live there must be Holiness in the way that we dress and the way that we present ourselves and he says sisters wear dresses wear long hair don't wear makeup their characteristics identify them as Holiness unto the Lord from above you may read that and say well is there some Spectrum upon which we can navigate these things okay well there these things are are are worth your prayer and your consideration but know that there's a way being expressed in these things I'm kind of maybe getting into my uh more in the details but if I could say this why does God ask that you dress a certain way in in clothing for men too there's ways that we dress as men men that is uh uh that is signaling the wrong things how is it that we ought to present ourselves men even with our hair women with their long hair and even with makeup and these different things and all these different ways men and women can adore themselves how is the world ever going to know there's Holiness apartness and separateness if there's no way your life ever looks any different than the guy in the cubicle next to you it's one of the things we've been robbed of with the Advent of all these apps and if anything God might the devil might have given in and said look look look look there's certain people that I know are are in the body and and I can't I can't stop it but what I can do is maybe keep them from bringing their Bible to work because when people see a Bible they know they're reading the Bible and I'll just let them take an iPad to work and they won't know if they're you know on substack scrolling through somebody's newsletter or if they're uh reading the news they won't know the difference they say well this is you're really getting into this weird area brother and I'm only suggesting that there is a nature and character of God that needs to be expressed and the more ways the devil can take away from us the separateness and the apartness the L Christ or the Lord is being seen these are things to really think about their characteristics identify them as Holiness unto the Lord From Above therefore we are seeking a kingdom we're seeking a king to come and receive his subjects to his kingdom and they are identified by their character characteristics their Treasures are not of this Earth or this nation it's of above Glory they look for a city whose Builder and maker is God they're citizens of that City that's me interjecting we are citizens we are habitants of a holy Jerusalem our habitation is not this Earthly home it's not whatever zip code we may be in we have a spiritual present tense habitation and we're citizens of another law of another kingdom of another way it's a highway it's a separate way it's a holy way he says they are properly identified we ought to challenge ourselves brothers and sisters young people all of us need to have a wakeup call and a little bit of a check to say Lord what is it I'm doing in my life that can signal and to broadcast And to clarify that we are separate amen sir oh God help us to do it he says they're identified by its characteristics thank you Lord Brothers you could come to your instruments maybe brother Michael if he could just be ready to help in the post in 2 Corinthians chap 7:1 this is a phrase that has so much depth having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit notice how closely that Associates with first John that we who have this hope we purify ourselves having these promises let us cleanse ourselves now this isn't our this isn't a pre- sanctification that we do in order to receive the Holy Ghost the the soul is sacred it's sealed I don't know if I've ever I've never really quite tried to calculate it but if the sum and substance of the Gospel was you must be born again which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're sealed into the kingdom and then next next person right you need to be born again then I mean the Bible would end like in Matthew 3 it it it'd be a very short short scripture reading or maybe we'd have more to say go into all the world and baptize people and get them born again but so much of the word is is is likened unto this whereas God created the Heaven and the Earth and creation and came to a perfect Eden and placed his son or daughter there son and daughter there in that perfect Eden through a process of seven days which included a day of rest God is doing the same thing in our lives where there's this process of perfection that is being expressed and that it's not just a matter of us having our seal a seal of God upon our souls but now having been sealed let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God perfecting Holiness if there is a Highway and a way and a way which is called Holiness a way speaks of manner of life it speaks of travel it speaks of Direction it speaks of progress and God is a God of a process just as much as he is the god of the product and sometimes we say well it's not just a matter about getting to the destination it's a matter of enjoying the journey and there may be some real hipster ways to describe it where we don't make the mistake of just wonder lust but we say well uh it's all about the journey doesn't matter if you get there well no that's not right we want to get there but God gets us there through a process so that when we arrive we fit there amen we can enjoy it while we're there we can be what he's called us to be when we're there in it's a way of Holiness it's a life of putting on the new man it's a life of continually purifying ourselves it's a life of perfecting Holiness in the fear of God that means Holiness this process that can bring something to Perfection completion it's even performing and accomplishing the purpose of Holiness this finish the purpose of moral Purity this modesty that we're to have this Immaculate cleansing has a purpose and an intent if we could try to draw from the several scriptures we used already today that we're to be carrying in on this course of righteousness and Holiness continually to live soberly and righteously and godly in the now says cleansing ourselves from all impure and unclean habits putting away anything that's an Abomination so that we can complete the purpose and fulfill the goal of Holiness Holiness is the character the characteristic of being set up apart for God not just set apart cuz some of us are in the sense of being different some of us are just set apart by birth right and we wouldn't make the mistake of saying that's the Holiness God wants they're just different right The Ugly Duckling was different and we're not just called to be different and be contrarians and go against the grain and fight everything and We're Not Making Peace at all but Holiness this Holiness we're talking about is a separateness this characteristic of being set apart for God in order to reflect his character and in doing so I want to be circumspect about the things that interrupt his expression that would Mar the image of God In My Flesh that would bring any evil favored because as we pursue Holiness God is unveiled God is made known by this sacred symmetry in your life have you ever noticed that in the word of God that as you read and and as you go through go through the word of God and you read no matter what you read and how much you read there's just always this beautiful picture that just keeps unfolding and it same with the message of the hour as you get into it and you open up your heart uh in sincerity before the Lord in prayer and and you just want to you want to learn of the Lord and learn of his nature and character you just realize there's this beautiful Symmetry and then sometimes something comes up and you're like well that I don't even know what that I don't even know what that means how can anyone know what that means this is this is different and then as you keep reading you just realize it becomes part of this picture picture you're like wow why because God is a god of divine proportion it's a god of beauty and really at the end of the day beauty is what inspires and if if we are going to be his voice if we're going to be his people we want to have an inspirational Beauty in our lives and I'm very I'm being very deliberate in the way that I express this because I having been raised in the message and uh and not that I was part of this particular not that my parents were this way I found my parents in a lot of ways uh extended a lot more grace than I think maybe they should have uh but being raised in the message you witness it you could be close to situations and scenarios where there's this really strict legalistic enforcement of parameters and I know I've been emphasizing this a lot over the last couple years so that at first glance when you look at it it looks holy but when you look at the way the picture is created that's not the way of God that's not his nature and I I implore anyone who may hear this anyone here today who's been resistant to the holy spirit because they don't like the image they saw when its work was attributed to a certain way that's not the way of Christ yes he's a god of Holiness yes he's a God that comes into your life will turn things upside down he's a God that's going to correct you when you do things wrong he's a God that doesn't make excuses for uh immorality and impurity it and all sorts of fornication and lust he doesn't make an excuse for that if you see others who haven't been judged and even you yourself haven't faced the punishment of it that's not because God's attitude towards it hasn't changed and if it's not preached as much even over this Pulpit or other places and now certain things are more emphasized than others that doesn't mean God's attitude has ever changed as sister Rebecca saying we've got to come back to an absolute and our absolute if I could just phrase it this way it is the word of God and and the the the absolute is is this scripture but the word the scripture reveals to us his nature and his way not just the artwork we want to enter into the process oh God I want to fully engage in your process as a Potter and I want to be a clay that fills your fingers and I want to experience your the your loving hand in the water and I want to know those moments when you tear me down only to experience those moments when you begin to build me back up Lord I don't want to just be a a vas set upon a shelf I don't want to just be some finished product that you just immediately put through the K but oh God I want you to take out anything that's insincere I want you to perfect this work amen God help us to be holy perfecting Holiness that's a living phrase isn't it perfecting Holiness God help us to do that amen if we could bow our heads in prayer and you stand with me let's [Music] pray let me emphasize this to all of us there's a standard of living that God desires of us and with I don't want to make the mistake of tending to uh give an excuse to anyone to continue to live in impurity but if the Bible is telling the believer that they're to put on the born again to put on you're created in Holiness and in righteousness uh you to you're to purify yourself you're to cleanse yourself and these things are all post salvation post seal then it could be said that there is this greater measure of separateness that we can achieve not as a means of gaining our salvation but as a means of pleasing the Lord and fulfilling his purpose in our [Music] life and therefore there is the danger of us being completely [Music] muted HD under a [Music] bushel fitting in with the world how many of your friends and your Associates outside of your immediate family and I'm not talking about H school but at school know you're a Christian [Music] a Christian perhaps different than the other [Music] Christians God help us gracious heavenly father today Lord as we close this service we desired to Worship in your presence and Lord I extended beyond the time frame that I had originally allotted to minister within but I just felt such a beautiful pull from the people and an openness to continue to hear in this I I'm grateful for their attitude and expectation to allow me to come to the end of my notes and so Lord I pray that you could just take it from here and I do want to impress upon the people so Lord I pray that you de with their hearts that we must give examination of any uncleanness or impurity seen or unseen and that women are to dress dress modestly and Lord we don't take out the tape measure and we don't try to figure out out you know who's wearing the highest heels and who has the the most dangerous uh skirt length but Lord It's incumbent upon the individual to examine themselves and ask is this a way that's pleasing to the Lord is this a is this an expression of beauty that can be attractive to the the the lost and the lame and the weak would this stumble the weak and Lord I know that the legalistic agenda and motivation of decades past is maybe put a Scarlet Letter and a bad taste in our mouths in terms of things that we dress and things that we do and whether it be sports or Recreation or entertainment there's this distaste for this unnecessary ugliness and legalism that bound people by fear so Lord I pray that you just liberate our hearts give us a sense that we're safe in your arms and that we're secure in your love and reteach us these paths so Lord that my way as a father could be plain for my son Elliott that my way as a man could be even plain for my daughter Eliza that my way as a friend oh Lord just how much we love to joke around and be witty and laugh and have a good time but Lord I I I want my life to be plainly holy that no matter what things we could enjoy joy in the world and what Recreations we can engage in and if we wear branded gear or we like a baseball hat or a sports team or sisters dress fashionably that no matter what it is there's some symmetry to the way that we live some moderation to those things that show yes we're human but we're sacred we're set apart we're Sanctified wake us up oh God I pray to recognize those things that defile deep within and set us at Liberty to pursue Holiness with everything that is in us for that is what the scripture is asking us of us to cleanse ourselves and to perfecting Holiness it's the pursuit of Holiness continually every day of our life it's the process we're in Lord and I want to fully submit and I ask that you bless the people that have been gathered here today those that may stream anyone on the archives Lord or live now Lord I pray that you would in your special way touch and awaken them to you your presence and your desire for Holiness in our lives we love you we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh God help us
