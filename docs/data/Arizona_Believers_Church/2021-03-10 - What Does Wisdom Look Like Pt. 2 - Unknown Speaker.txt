TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our gracious heavenly father as we stand in your divine presence this evening we're now turning our attention to your word desiring that you could come up behind it with an even greater force than you did in our worship knowing by faith that you are here and believing also lord if you would make your presence known to us as we lifted our hands and our voices then how much more will you make yourself known if we lift up your word so come now father you be the one that rightly divides the word of truth may you take what we know to be infallible what we know to be perfect this word of god and speak it to our hearts that it may be received into good ground and bring forth good fruit fruit to a hundred fold fruit unto perfection so lord we commit ourselves to you tonight desiring that you continue to move in this service i believe that you have already taken control of it for your glory now lord we just set ourselves aside and desire that you continue this great work tonight as we commit ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen let's turn to the book of james james chapter 3 verses 13 to 18. james chapter 3 verses 13 to 18 just some marvelous presence that's here with this tonight so we'll just being very sensitive to that we'll jump right into the word so as to not distract anything james chapter 3 starting with verse 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envy and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish for where envy and strife is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace you can have your seats i'm going to continue on the subject of what does wisdom look like and take uh as we were focusing sunday on wisdom is the word in action and wisdom looks like christ wisdom is christ i want to take this subject of meekness what wisdom looks like and begin to identify meekness and as i i just want to make a few statements in maybe the outset to emphasize this point how that wisdom is the word in action and so when we see wisdom and we know it's true wisdom or even if we don't know its wisdom wisdom is the word in action and the word in action is often contrary to popular wisdom they say well the this is what prevailing uh authority would do and this is what the popular uh uh the population would do and this is what people would do by vote or consent but uh so with the wisdom of god is contrary to popular wisdom but it's never contrary to the word and so it may run counter to our intuition it may be against even some of our instincts but one thing about the wisdom that is from above it will never violate the principles of god's word and we identified on sunday how the mystery of jesus christ holds all treasures of wisdom and knowledge so if you're going to have wisdom real spiritual wisdom it's going to come through the knowledge of jesus christ or understanding of christ if you're going to have real knowledge or any tre any richness in your knowledge any benefit from knowledge it's going to come from the revelation of jesus christ and one of our emphasis has been that to know him and to have this wisdom knowledge understanding revelation however you might want to place it in terms of your vocabulary it gives us practical discernment a discernment that's very practical not a discernment that makes us popular at parties and be able to read people's minds but something that's very practical and it gives us understanding that is useful and this is a discernment this is a wisdom this is an understanding that you can use every day in your life you can use it on the job you can use it in your relationships with other people you can use it within the family you can use it in working through disagreements with your spouse which i know none of us have them that's for the streamers uh but it's it's so that you can work through even raising your children the right way it gives you wisdom practical wisdom and useful understanding now i want to pick up in james chapter 3 verse 13 and james is taking wisdom in the book of james you'll find it's something that's repeated throughout and the emphasis that he gives he's placing wisdom as the crown of a true believer's perfect character and how that faith is made perfect by works or perfectly expressed through works he's taking wisdom and he's placing it kind of as a crown of a true believer's character and even the crown of a true believer's faith that you can say you have faith but if your faith doesn't work then your faith is dead and this practical outworking of faith is manifested in wisdom and it becomes a crown in a person's life and so he's emphasizing this faith as a some sort of consummation of a believer's character and so he asked this question james chapter 3 verse 13 and we're going to jump into it right here and be right in this area for the remainder of the service he says who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you so he asked the question who's wise who's endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom so in james asking the question this way who's why who's a wise man who is skilled who has a a particular skill or acumen and who is sharp who's shrewd and he says an endued with knowledge so these are two different principles that are related but he's kind of setting them together to think who's wise who's been empowered with knowledge and this phrase endued with knowledge is not used elsewhere in the new testament though it's a similar phrase that's found in the old testament and endued with knowledge it's one that has the knowledge of an expert who's wise and has the knowledge of an expert and having the knowledge of an expert in wisdom that makes them a particularly useful be one thing to have the wisdom of an expert but not know how to apply it not know how to formulate the best plans and then the best plans for the execution which is best way to execute the plan which is what wisdom speaks to and these are if i could say this way the wisdom or the wise man it speaks to an aspect of wisdom and even to be endued with knowledge speaks about an aspect of wisdom and so these two aspects of wisdom relate to understanding and even moral action it's speaking about somebody who has understanding who has the skills of an expert but yet there's it's a moral action it's something that's practical something that works itself out and even the word that's used about endued with knowledge it speaks of a discernment ability to make distinctions and in this uh aspect of wisdom that relates to understanding and moral action it's not just merely things that are moral it's not relating to a morality and even nature or natural decisions and natural decision-making but it's a wisdom that's rooted in spiritual wisdom and and we touched on this by identifying how that you have to be born again uh from above and you the double-minded man is one who doesn't have that mind of christ through the new birth to find that stability and that root or that anchor and so when he talks about a wise man and dude with knowledge it's not just somebody who's moral or has a particular expertise with respect to natural things but it's a wisdom that's rooted in the word it's a wisdom that can come back to the word of god and be in harmony with the word and so this phrase is used a few times in the old testament where you have wise and understanding used together and i want to refer to them and start with deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. moses is saying behold i've taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord my god commanded me so we know that god spoke to moses then moses taught the people and many times the word says and the lord said unto moses and god says speak ye unto the people and tell them this so the statutes and judgments that moses shared with the children of israel they were the lord's commandments and and he says that ye should do so in the land whether you go to possess it keep therefore and do them so the word of god as given by the prophet moses to the people is what they are to keep and to observe and he says for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations so the wisdom of the people was their ability to hear the word of god and to do the word of god so the wise man and endued with knowledge we don't think in terms of who seems to be moral and has even natural integrity but this is something that relates to the word of god and aligns with the character and nature of the word not just some a moral principle or a natural skill or ability so the lord gives the commandments keep them therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people now we might wrestle with that and trying to figure out how that israel could keep the law perfectly and all the outsiders and all the heathens and all the gentiles would say wow these people are wise and full of understanding and because israel failed to keep it perfectly we'll never know but it suggests that if they had done that if they had taken the word of god kept heard them kept them and did them then that would have been their wisdom and their understanding and this they would look at this great nation and said that they are wise and an understanding people and so james is hearkening back to this concept when he says who's a wise man endued with knowledge among you they have the wisdom and understanding who is this person and isaiah chapter 5 verses 20 and 21 it says woe unto them that call evil good and good evil put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter easily summarizes they lack discernment they don't know what's good they don't know what's bad because they call good evil they call evil good they call darkness light light darkness and then the sweet they call it bitter they last that they lack that distinction in their perception and their taste and their understanding and so it's woe to that person and then this phrase again is you though it's different words in our english translation it says woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes imprudent in their own sight and so this is wisdom unders and understanding but yet it's in the carnal sense where one is wise in their own eyes well i'm wise i can figure this out i can make my way through this or prudent understanding i have knowledge and i have all the things that i need it very well could characterize laodicea that says we're wise we have a lot of skill we we can plan we can plan a lot of things and we know the best way to execute them and we've learned a lot we've we've gathered knowledge we've accumulated data through thousands of years and through the centuries but that the bible is saying that this kind of wisdom and this kind of prudence is a detriment because they lack the spiritual discernment to recognize evil and to recognize good spiritual discernment to say that's sweet that's bitter this is light and that's darkness so james says who is a wise man endued with knowledge among you this is a wisdom and a knowledge that's related to the word of god it's rooted in the commandments of the lord and james is specifically dealing with those who place themselves as teachers and i just felt very directed to share this part although i know i'm not speaking to a group of people that claim to be leaders and teachers in the in the word of god and we're all trying to be um uh prophets and we're all trying to pastor but it speaks to those who place themselves as teachers and leaders and i will in a moment come down to how that's applicable to all of us in some way but he's identifying that true leadership requires more than just a profession that i'm a leader and more than just assuming the position well i have this position so you need to listen to me or i i am this so you should hear me james is identifying who is a wise man and dude with knowledge who's going to be a master who's going to be a teacher well it's going to have to be one who's wide and wise and endued with knowledge and he's wanting to amplify what the nature and characteristic would be of somebody that you should listen to this is very important just to kind of catch here because in deuteronomy chapter 1 verse 13 this is another instance where wise and understanding is used together and as akin to this phrase of who's a wise man and endued with knowledge among you god is this is the wisdom spoken to moses take you wise men and understanding known among your tribes and i will make them rulers over you here's god's wisdom to moses take a wise take wise men and understanding men who are wise and endued with knowledge that have discernment known among your tribes so they are known they have their known commodity you know their works you know their family you know where they belong and i will make them rulers over you so this quality for ruler that god identified was that they were wise and understanding a ruler speaks of a leader speaks of a guide it's someone that's going to be looked to as an authority even the word is used as a head and so a head properly has to have wisdom and understanding not the profession that they are ahead and not the assumption of the position it's a lot of people that can be in positions of leadership or headship but lack the wisdom that the bible's speaking of and don't have the knowledge that the bible is speaking of and we ought to have the discernment of whether or not they they lack it right we should have the discernment that just because someone has the name on their badge or somebody claims it or professes it we have the kind of discernment to recognize that someone in this position and even we could challenge ourselves as we'll come to in a moment if i'm going to be accepting of or i've entered into some role of responsibility and leadership then i need to be endued with knowledge and have wisdom to execute that so both these qualities are required if one desires or claims to be a teacher or to be a head because james is dealing specifically with those who are a master or a teacher and in hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 to 14 or 12 to 14 i believe is maybe where we'll take it it speaks directly to this um concept of we ourselves also being teachers let me just make sure i have the um the right reference here verse starting with verse 12 hebrews chapter 5 verses 12 to 14 it says for when the time ye ought to be teachers so now he speaks that in some way we as believers mature to a place where we have the ability to communicate truth and to express it he says for when you ought to be teachers when the time has come that you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and to become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe so though james is dealing with the principle of who's a teacher among you who's going to be a leader who's going to have a position among you in the body of christ or who's going to be one that would teach you the principles of the word of god he's saying that type of person ought to be one who's endued with wisdom endued with knowledge and has wisdom identifying this very particularly that we ought to recognize that in those who set them for set themselves forth as teachers who is the wise man and endued with knowledge among you and then he begins to say this is how you must these are things that you must recognize that relates to wisdom and being endued with knowledge but lest we all just kind of sit back and say okay tonight we're going to be instructed how to judge ministry or how to judge those that claim to be ministers or pastors or teachers let's make it all applicable to ourselves because if we could start with ourselves then we'll be better qualified to judge even others because there is there's a there's a line there where we're not to judge but then there's a line where we must judge we want to be sure that we're always on the right side of the word when it comes to distinctions and discernment and judgment and since paul is expressing that we through the maturing of the word of god could come to a place of judgment and understanding to be teachers ourselves then the principles that james expresses about judging one who sets themselves forth as a master we can also apply it to us these principles are applicable to all of us who desire wisdom if we're going to ask god for wisdom and he'll give it liberally then this is something that we can practically judge ourselves by to determine whether or not the wisdom of god is operating in our hearts so it's applicable to all of us but also with respect to leadership and i want to i hope that you can make this very personal to yourselves and to your situation it's going to be very very simple and direct very specific tonight so he says uh who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you this is james 3 13 and let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom let him show so if wisdom and knowledge are not shown then they're dead just like faith which is not working is dead if someone is says that they have wisdom if someone says they're a wise man and a dude with knowledge and james is actually saying if there is a wise man among you who's endued with knowledge then let him show so wisdom and knowledge are to be shown just like our faith is to be expressed through works wisdom and knowledge are to be shown john wesley took this verse and said it this way let him show his wisdom as well as his faith by his works not by words only the beautiful way to summarize it let him show his wisdom as well as his faith by his works not by words only well i'm a wise man and i believe and i'm a believer and i am wise and i have this and i have that and i give good counsel and i'm this and i'm that instead of one just claiming it how about having it how about living it how about giving it so we say let it be by their actions not just by their words only so let him who the wise man and dude with knowledge let him show out of a good conversation now he uses the phrase out of a good conversation not to refer to you know an instance where you one person communicates one per thing and the other person communicates back this isn't a text message or a dm this is a a good conversation literally means not a single act or occurrence but a life so to do it out of a good conversation it's not a single act but it's a course of living it is a way of life it's a manner of life we could say a good conversation well we have that sometimes with each other wow did you talk to so and so yeah how did it go it was a good conversation but the phrase that's being used here would talk about a way of life is lived not just one moment not just instance one instance where they say you know even a a broken clock is right twice a day and so you don't you don't want to be the broken clock that's you know you're right every once why i guess there's another phrase that even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while too we want to be those that aren't just oh stumbling on happiness and stumbling on success and accidentally getting it right and all of our normal accidents adding up to something good but this is somebody you look at the whole character of their life and you say that this is a life that's lived well it is a how do they let them show out of a a life that is upright let them show out of a life that is worthy of the gospel we're challenged with the question is your life worthy of the gospel so it's a life that's righteous it's upright worthy of the gospel it's one that is influenced by the grace of god this is exactly what james is challenging us with we can challenge ourselves this is what we we're looking for in our own lives if we have asked god for wisdom and he's granted it liberally then what we want to see is not just a moment where we got it right but see a life that's changing and one that's influenced by the grace of god it's a life that's characterized by mercy it's a life that's characterized by goodness even jesus when he says in matthew chapter 5 verse 16 let your light so shine before men that men might see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven this is what james is referring to let him show out of a good conversation his works let him show a life that's lived let him show letting his light shine that when others see that light they're seeing the goodness of god it's what god was setting forth when he told the children of israel that if you will keep my statutes and my commandments and do them then your wisdom and your understanding will be in the sight of the nations that they'll see it and they'll marvel and say this is a wise and understanding people if you hear the word and do it if you act upon it you're showing a out of a good conversation works a shining light and so it says let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom this phrase just to me keeps abounding and abounding and abounding even more and more to where it's almost as if you can repeat a phrase over and over and again and it loses its distinction and the words just in syllables begin to run together the more i look at this the more i look at it the more that it's it seems to me as something more distinct and more profound as if i had never even heard it before the meekness of wisdom it's declaring right off the bat that true wisdom is associated with meekness that it cannot be separated from it it's a gentleness of life it's a wisdom with humility brother branham when he's talking in how can i overcome and he's teaching us how that jesus overcame and he's wanting us to understand that the manner in which christ overcame is the same manner in which we overcome that jesus did not overcome base based upon a blood test to say well hey look take my blood and you'll find that my dna can't be traced to anybody here on earth i'm a different kind of specimen i'm a different kind of species and though the blood that ran through his veins was deity and though he could be able to testify that he had not bypassed his theophany and he knew where he came from and that the father dwelt perfectly in him he didn't overcome by dynamics that we don't possess today he overcame by the word and humility and so it took an elect son of god a predestinated son of god the very manifestation of the son of man and he places his ability to overcome not in the wisdom of the world but the wisdom which is from above that he could overcome by the word and humility wasn't in the way that he could rub his hands together and hold him together just right at just the right moment to cause something to transpire something to happen but he went by the word and by humility brother graham says overcome how by taking the word the promise in humility humbly walking so the meekness of wisdom wisdom is the word in action the meekness of wisdom then is the humility that's joined with it to make it effective the gentleness which let him show forth out of a good out of a good conversation his works with the meekness of wisdom it's a certain wisdom of humility a gentleness of life now i'm going to use two more verses or i believe just two more verses here in james maybe three more verses as he expounds upon this and and i'm not going to amplify the part where he says the wisdom which is from above but you can go and read those things later as we've already read them tonight and see that he's using phrases to expound more on this meekness of wisdom and what it looks like and how it acts but what he begins to express and when he calls says that the meekness of wisdom he let me say what wisdom does not look like or what is not wisdom wisdom does not look noisy wisdom does not look arrogant it's important for us to ponder this because it's he's wanting us to identify who is the wise man and endued with knowledge among you wisdom is the me he speaks the meekness of wisdom it is not boy boisterous it's not boastful wisdom is not self-justifying wisdom is not egotistical or egocentric it's not centered upon self wisdom is not expressed to lift the one who expresses it up when wisdom expresses itself then truth is it lifted up when true wisdom from above is expressed then god has lift up not the individual that's imparting it if one can actually express true wisdom in the meekness of wisdom then one doesn't walk away saying man that brother is smart they walk away feeling as if they've heard from god they walk away feeling as if the lord has opened up something to them not the not the sharpness and the shrewdness of the man and so it's a now we can make the mistake sometimes by attributing certain things to the the manner in which something is delivered or the way that someone structures something but when we really want to get it and it be useful to our lives we need to recognize that that wisdom is from above and not through the man and so he he's showing us that wisdom is not noisy it's not arrogant it's not a boy boastful and it is so it doesn't lift itself up it's not self-justifying and it's not selfish wisdom is not expressed to take advantage of somebody true wisdom is not going to be used in a way wisdom which is from above wisdom that is that is spiritual wisdom who is a wise man and endued with knowledge let him show forth out of a good conversation his works with the meekness of wisdom and others wisdom is it looking to take advantage of somebody else wisdom is not selfish therefore we can understand that true wisdom is not abusive truism is not controlling truism is not manipulative truism it does not intend to bring shame and to shame you and to make you feel awful to make you feel embarrassed true wisdom does not want to motivate you by fear i feel like saying come on somebody because it's true this is this is what the bible is trying to express to us now this is good on two parts number one let's all challenge ourselves that when we have truth on our sides let's not resort to force or any form of manipulation or control to get someone to accept truth if you have truth on your side you've got all you need you just ask god to give you wisdom to impart it to stay true to it and to express it in righteousness and then also so it gives us we can challenge ourselves that if i know that this is wisdom if i know this is from above then i should be able to conduct myself in a certain way i should have confidence with this truth that i'm trying to apply to my children or in this relationship or in this particular situation on my job and then also begin to recognize when one is supposing to be wise someone is trying to assert themselves as your head or as your teacher as your guide or one is wanting to give you counsel but you notice that at the end of the day what they're really trying to do is put you under their thumb and recognize they say wait a minute if i do exactly what they tell me to do it benefits them but where's the benefit for me and my family where's the benefit for me as an individual where is the glory to god where's the where's christ going to get the glory in this situation so it's very very practical for us to recognize that wisdom is not arrogant it's not abusive it's not controlling it's not self-justifying it's not selfish but true wisdom is always meek it's gentle it's calm it's it's something that is actually mild but firm and steady true wisdom does not need to raise the volume to get its point across truism is satisfied in being wisdom it does not need to uh it does not need to exaggerate it does not need to go to extremes it does not need to change the back story it doesn't need to change the context wisdom is something that is just firm and steady and being firm and steady it rests very strongly but quietly it's not snoring it just sets there very silently resting and i pondered this that may have been last week or earlier this week how whenever there's a ruckus and i know we all we all gotten ruckuses when we were in the world and there was a bruja hog going and people were sticking their chest out and people were kicking off their shoes and taking off their shirts come on come on bring it you want something pull over it's always the guy over there not wanting is not saying anything real quiet the guy said no i don't want any trouble no hey man i'm sorry that's the guy you want to back off and say you know what he could probably whip me really really good because he's not having to blow up get all loud and get all arrogant puff up and start fighting and using a lot of a big talk because he knows where he stands he's like i know i can take everybody in this room but it's not worth it and so they're usually the most quiet that wasn't me talking that was me as if somebody else was up here you know somebody spends a lot of time in the dojo not me and so that somebody could say no i know where i stand i know i can defend myself i know if i wanted to i could i could um god's physical harm and so they're the ones that are very quiet the ones very cool like hey man no i got no beef i'm sorry that's all right and they'll take all sorts of abuse and verbal abuse and even picking on and small little touches and things like that because they don't need they don't have to prove anything it rest wisdom rests very strongly but something that's arrogant and loud this kind of stormy competitious demeanor it does not indicate trustworthy counsel this is how we can challenge ourselves whether or not we're really convinced about what we're saying if we can rest quietly in the wisdom that we have or do we have to get more forceful or more loud or more manipulative with it but then we could also use it to discern whether or not there's some kind of false wisdom that's trying to bombard us it's something that is arrogant and loud does not indicate safe counsel this is a warning sign as james is lifting it up because true wisdom is quiet and something that wants to grit its teeth and intimidate you and cause fear that's something that's not safe counsel but the wisdom of the the word shows in all actions a life that exhibits rest and peace and so when we read that it says that let him show out of a good conversation his works with the meekness of wisdom it means true wisdom is always accompanied with meekness and meekness has such deep meaning it even speaks about the government of passions one's ability to govern their passions it speaks to ruling your own emotions not that you don't have them but meekness is the ability to bring them subject meekness is the ability to govern passions and to restrain them and restrain emotions and make emotions subject to the word of god as believers do we sorrow yes we sorrow but not as the world sorrows as believers we can feel we can feel certain emotions but we realize we don't go to the extreme that the world does we bring them subject to the word of god our headship is in the word of god so meekness is the ability to restrain emotions and govern passions james chapter three if you if you look at the heading in your bible and mine it speaks james chapter three is called the unruly tongue and the subject of chapter 3 is controlling of the tongue it's talking about temperance and it's talking about how that you know he who is able to control his tongue this is a perfect man and the man who can't control his tongue a man who's always spouting off a man who's always intemperate and and angry and spiteful and saying things that uh that are harmful or abusive just however you really want to say it he's talking about a mouth and a tongue being full of deadly poison he says anyone who can control that that is a man who is wise this is a man who gives good counsel such as a perfect man so meekness is inseparable from true wisdom and in verse 13 who is a wise man and a dude with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with the meekness of wisdom verse 13 is talking about how wisdom acts that wisdom is something that has a particular way that it acts you'll know wisdom by how things get done you'll know wisdom by how it motivates people you know wisdom by how objectives are accomplished there's a way that the world can try to get things done i had a baseball coach in high school and he motivated by fear and you felt it you felt it in every practice you felt it in the off season you felt it in the games you felt that if you were on jv and he's the varsity coach you always just had this coach who was ready to chew you out in the back of your mind and he believed that fear was a great motivator and it worked with respect to baseball because he was an awesome coach but god doesn't motivate that way god has never been a motivator by fear he motivates by faith and so you know true wisdom by how it works within your heart does it provoke fear do you have the fear of missing out do you feel like well if i do that i'm going to lose this i'm going to lose that this is going to happen that's going to happen i'm going to just all sorts of things that rest in people's head that if that's the wisdom you're digesting you ought to be able to have the discernment to say this doesn't taste right this isn't bringing peaceable fruit this isn't this isn't from above the way that we're approaching the situation the way that we're wanting to see god come on the scene for us this is not going to bring forth a peaceable peaceable fruit because it's not wisdom from above because you're looking at how it gets things done and how objectives are accomplished the meekness of wisdom it means wisdom is meek and as we'll see in the preceding verses that wisdom does not dispute it does not fight it does not quarrel it does not wrestle but it rests in truth if it's wisdom from above then it's settling it's resting as a way of just covering something and a person could just give into it and yield to it but if it's this wisdom that we're going to read a moment that comes from beneath it's fighting for preeminence it's fighting to get above it's fighting to assert itself and and to come to the top and show that it's really the strong one or the good one but the wisdom is meek it doesn't fight it doesn't quarrel it doesn't wrestle it's just resting in truth and the old testament if we took time to examine many different scriptures we'd find that the meek as it's used in the old testament they're characterized those that were meek were characterized as relying upon god to defend them against any injustice the meek were people who didn't have to rail they didn't have to fight back they didn't have to throw back accusations if they were treated wrong if they were abused if things were not going their way they had they just said well you know what god's my defender the lord fights my battles and and that's who you characterized as the meek they were the ones that knew they were the ones in my example earlier that knew that they had a power on their side an ability on their side that could defeat everyone else in the brawl but didn't need to engage because the battle wasn't theirs they were trusted in something higher so they did not need to resort to their own devices they did not need to use their own abilities or their own schemes their own revenge however you want to place that to respond to a hurt or to respond to an offense because wisdom knows that god permits difficulties wisdom knows that god uses them to perfect us and wisdom knows that god delivers us out of them all so this is the wisdom that's from above wisdom knows that when you're in a difficult situation then you know that god god permits these and when you can accept that god permits certain things and you can recognize that if it's happening to you then it's permitted it changes a lot in the way that we react one of my biggest shames has been over the last several years is how little i truly have accepted the truth that how do we how do we prove our love to him by conducting ourselves with joy admits the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass and in my actions not not necessarily how i would have articulated it but in my actions and my response it's as if i took that statement to mean that there's some that he permits and allows but there's others that he doesn't but realize this as a son or daughter of god every trial you go through he has permitted in his wisdom so that no matter what you go through you just say lord you have in your wisdom allowed this to come to pass so this is god's wisdom active in my life he's trying to teach me something there's something i need to learn from this and so at the end of the day i'm going to conduct myself with joy admits the worst thing that's ever happened to me before because i know that god permitted this in his wisdom and not engage as we often do well i'm just trying to figure out whether or not this is god's wisdom or not and that's what we wrestle with many times at the end of the day we're like man i just is this god is this the devil is this the lord or is this the devil and what we need to realize is hey if it's god or if it's the devil he's permitted it and begin to rest in his work because god will permit it god will use it god will deliver us in his time so meekness in the scripture is a mildness of disposition to be meek it speaks of a gentleness of spirit so there's a very very clear and specific character characteristics of wisdom that james james wants us to catch we think of wisdom as being a solomon on the throne arrayed in his glory but wisdom doesn't always look that way wisdom is a of a gentle spirit it's the opposite of being self-assertive it's the opposite of self-interest and the in the ability to not be self-asserted to put yourself forward the ability to not try to serve your own interest stems from the rest that one is putting in god and the confidence that one place is in the lord i know he'll take care of me so i don't have to scheme i know he's watching out over the church so i don't have to try to protect it in my own carnality i know that he's going to advance his interests so i don't have to try to protect my own it's a yielding to god those that don't trust in the lord have to assert themselves to to make a way for them to to they have to make their own way that to put themselves forward because we're taught the gift makes way for itself you can always tell when someone's not quite sure about what god has done for them and the gift that they have because they're always trying to justify they're always trying to vindicate it they're always trying to make a way for it but the meek are not occupied with themselves they have no sense of self-entitlement they're yielding to god they're trusting to him they're not trusted in their own ability they're not self-sufficient that's what meekness is they're not self-sufficient as they they enlail to see if they were rich we're increased with goods and have need of nothing this is the very opposite of meekness look what i can do look who i am look what i've accomplished he's actually those that are meek are saying you know what if it had my name on it it was god that did it anyway so i'm not really going to stick my head up and brag about it because i know at the end of the day they can't take credit for it so the meek are not so occupied with themselves because they have no they've shed this sense of entitlement let's amplify that by reading verse 14 then james chapter 3 and we'll read to verse 16 verses 14 to 16. who is a wise man an endued with knowledge let him show forth out of a good conversation his works with the meekness of wisdom but now he's saying this is what we should see the meekness of wisdom and this so this is contrasting and amplifying what it means by the meekness of wisdom but if ye have bitter envy and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is and and by using that singular verb is really joining them together where envy and strife is there is confusion in every evil work so james is contrasting true wisdom from a false wisdom he calls it sin earthly sensual devilish so that kind of wisdom is different from the meekness of wisdom the true spiritual wisdom so before even before he amplifies the meekness of wisdom from above in the preceding verses after verse 16 he's defining the wisdom from below he's wanting us to be able to recognize the kind of wisdom that originates in the flesh the kind of wisdom that's earthly and sensual and devilish and he characterizes it by bitter envy and which is jealousy and bitter strife which is selfish ambition politicking party making wisdom which is from beneath wisdom which is from below is jealous it lacks gentleness it strives it creates conflict and positions and and polarization he's just being very very blunt about it if you have bitter envy and strife in your hearts you didn't get that wisdom from above that that if teaching has produced that then you didn't get that from christ he's saying something is wrong somewhere if there's bitter jealousy and bitter selfish ambition something that is uh very profound about the use of the word gentleness and it relates to meekness and it's contrasted by jealousy gentleness is the opposite of jealousy because jealousy is the inability to rejoice when somebody else is blessed and gentle gentleness means you rejoice when somebody else is blessed but if you're insecure and you're calling insecure in your position and secured who you are insecure in what god has made you or what god has given you as soon as god gives somebody else something different or even something equal you immediately want to distinguish yourself so you have a lot of things to say about that person or about the benefit of the blessing to make it seem inferior to what you have because you simply can't just say isn't that wonderful what god is doing isn't that wonderful what god has done did you hear this did you hear that gentleness is the ability to rejoice when somebody else testifies about the goodness of god but if you have that little and your spirit and there's something in you that wrestles with and gets bitter whenever you hear a testimony or god something being lifted up something being praised immediately challenge yourself whether or not that originates within you and your ability to rejoice is the source your own bitterness is a source your own jealousy he says where you need wisdom from above jealousy is a lack of gentleness so he says where there's bitter envy and bitter strife he says this wisdom this knowledge this experience this understanding or perception is not from god but it's earthly it's sensual it's devilish it's superficial it not being from above it's not deep it being very superficial and very shallow it's not discerning this wisdom that produces these characteristics is not established in truth but he says this wisdom produces confusion in every evil work there's the instability again the wisdom that is from the earth the wisdom that is sensual the wisdom that is devilish creates an instability a state of disorder it's disturbance when you are feeding on the wrong kind of wisdom you should know it in your spirit there's a part of you that becomes unsettled and that's when you know that you're not a double-minded man when you have that part deep inside of you that can recognize when something's trying to move you off the center and rule you in the emotional realm and you could take the word of god and say no i got to bring this now subject to the word bring it back to the word and become stable again get that equilibrium back and so where there's confusion in every evil work it's speaking of a restlessness why is it self-assertive why is it selfish why is it manipulative why is it controlling because it's restless where there's confusion in every evil work he's described in a state of rebellion where things are not in their proper order things are not subject to the higher powers it's chaos in that situation this wisdom he says descended not from above so then meekness now i'm just about to arrive to my my closing scriptures and if you're worried that the sermon's going to be too short my closing scriptures are an entire chapter in the old testament now you're really getting nervous because some long ones in the old testament so let's ponder this as we want to bring this to a head here this meekness that's talking about meekness comes from the revelation of knowing that god is in control a revelation that god is in control and you are a part of god brother tim dodd mentioned many many years ago it was so helpful to me it was at a men's meeting and he was using the example of joseph and he said you talk about how knowing your position resolves bitterness even to even to look back and see that whatever whatever has been done to harm you whatever's been done as a conspiracy against you whatever other people have done and how they've acted and all the things that they've done if you're confident that god has looked out after you and used all those things to make you more blessed and to produce a greater character in your life and to bring blessing your way if you're at peace with that then you can look back at all the evil actors in your life and you still don't have to hold a grudge you say you know what was meant for evil god's used i know this brother might have meant that and i really thought this brother was uh somebody that i could trust and you look back and you see all these things if you're really secure that god is in control and that he's placed you in your position it resolves bitterness that's why joseph still didn't harbor any bitterness in his heart even though the reality of everything that had been done to him was wicked was vile and was meant for evil he still recognized that god had put him in his position not just despite it but by it and it resolved any hard feelings he would have against any of the bad actors in his life and therefore he could be meek even in the face of his accusers he could be meek in the face of his abusers he let go of even his sense of demanding justice and things need to be a certain way because meekness comes from the revelation that god is in control and i'm a part of god thus wisdom responds to complication because we haven't left this whole train of thought that the end of the beginning now it's complicated and even the the and if you're wondering what does this have to do with family does not conflict help you understand the use of the phrase conflict not help you understand what it has to do with family resolving things and having wisdom what is it we want we don't want just a list of rules if this happens do this and it's like a cheat sheet we really actually think that we can sit down and be handed a cheat sheet so that whenever something happens we just pull it out and say hmm okay page chapter and have a playbook listen this still needs the wisdom of god to make it applicable that's what we're needing we're needing wisdom not just a bunch of rules and algorithms that we just can memorize and apply in every situation but lord give me wisdom parents who are homeschooling people who are teachers even in an academic setting have realized that not everybody in the classroom not everybody in the family learns the same way so you have to adapt you've got the curriculum you've got the answer book you think oh this is going to be easy we've got this we've got everything we need to teach and you think it's just like let's read the lesson now do the workbook and i'll grade it when you're done and you do everything that was laid out before you're like they're not getting it what do you need at that point you need some wisdom to figure out why are they not getting it what kind are they a different kind of learner is the curriculum not even suited for this child is there a different way that we need to come at this it's not just having some curriculum that spells out all the things you're going to need to do but it's god giving the wisdom from above i don't know that anybody here was thinking what in the world does this have to do with where you what you've been preaching on to the last 52 services but here we are wanting to emphasize this that true wisdom responds to complication differently than earthly wisdom responds to criticism it responds to injustice it responds to difficulty differently than earthly wisdom in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 it says now i paul myself beseech you how he's going to beseech them how he's going to plead with them by the meekness and gentleness of christ that's what paul wanted to use the meekness and gentleness of christ i do believe that christ came to bring a sword i believe that christ is the word it is it is the sword that's been placed into the hands of the believer that christ is this lion he has revealed himself with this mane of a line he's declaring he's shouting he's he's bringing forth great judgment in this end time but he the same one who's the lion also is a lamb and so he says i can i want to use the meekness and gentleness of christ the clemency the mildness the fairness the even the word that's used in one translation i believe is the sweet reasonableness of christ there was a sweetness to his reason that though he was tied to the word and though he used the word and he could not react outside of it there wasn't this harshness that always came with it to where it was just bold in your face and there was never this yielding and this understanding and a really uh an apprehension of the situation that he was facing but the word was always effective in his mouth so paul says i want to use the maintenance and gentleness of christ the words that are used here paint the picture of moderation paint the picture of patience and grace we could even read about the characteristics of love what james is lifting up and what paul is referring to about the meekness and gentleness of christ is something that endures something that is kind something that is long-suffering being short-tempered and impatient relates to the lack of humility it relates to the lack of meekness this is why james is saying hey if you're a leader you shouldn't be a brawler that's why paul says it you shouldn't be someone that rolls up their sleeves and gets in fist fights if we're gonna if we're gonna have the right kind of temperament within relationships with our family we ought not be the ones that immediately roll up proceeds hey you want to fight and let's fight and so this quick temperament this impatience is the lack of humility it's a lack of meekness because how is jesus christ destruct meek and lowly we've allowed the devil to describe meekness as weakness when in reality the meek the broken are ones that have favor with god and power with god when jacob became israel when he was limping when he was broken then he had favor and power with god as israel so meekness isn't weakness because it begins with submission to god and james did not just tell us to resist the devil and he'll flee he said submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he'll flee resistance without submission is futile we've done a lot of resisting without submitting and that's why it's failed but first submit yourselves therefore to god then resist the devil and he will no question about it he will flee so our meekness begins with submission to god so meekness is not bondage through helplessness and through weakness and since meekness begins with our submission to god and it's not because we're hopeless and because we're weak therefore there's no need for force there's no need for deceit when it comes to meekness if you've left meekness the meekness of wisdom if you don't have the meekness of wisdom but you have some sort of earthly wisdom you will resort to deceit and trickery because you think you're right and you'll justify the deceit you'll justify the white lie you'll justify a little bit of the fudging because you feel well this is true and so i can get away with this whereas wisdom does not need to manipulate the facts wisdom truism from above can rest in the truth and it does not need to resort to force or deceit to get the job done therefore the meat because we're saying wisdom responds to complication differently the meek endures suffering and criticism at the hand of others very differently than an earthly devilish wisdom the meat can suffer harm at the hand of others and look at their the one that's harming them and actually have pity on them how can you have pity on an accuser how can you have pity on an abuser how can you have pity on one that's criticizing how can you have pity on one that's harming how can you have pity because you're overwhelmed with the sense that you know what's motivating them you know what's guiding you know what they're working against you know what you're called to and therefore knowing that they have a wisdom that's from beneath and you have a wisdom from above you can look at them as objects of your pity like oh god they have no idea what they're doing we ought to be able to suffer criticism better than we have in the past we ought to be able to endure slights and accusations and false narratives and lies and difficulty and situations for even you know you know you're being falsely accused you know that's not the way it happened you know and be able to conduct yourself in such a way to say lord i don't know what i'm going to do this is this is not right i didn't do that i'm being falsely accused and rest in knowing that what you did was what he wanted you to do knowing that if you're wrong then you just need to say i'm sorry i made a mistake and take the the they no longer would it takes that ability to control you through condemnation and shame right away i'm sorry you're right i should have done that i'm real i'm really sorry please forgive me i was wrong for that and they're like wait a minute i've been told stories of others who are in road rage situations where someone pulls up next to them and is just going nuts and crazy like i am so sorry i did not see you and they're like huh what wait a minute i always want to get the fisty cuffs i got a concealed carry i was wanting to use today and you're just like hey man i'm sorry i made a mistake it defuses it when you go and read in the proverbs about how a soft answer turneth away wrath he begins to talk about how wisdom speaks and wisdom does not have to get boastful and forceful and loud it can rest strongly and knowing the truth's on his side so james concludes in verse 14 not concludes but let me just say go back to what he says in verse 14. if you have bitter envion and strife in your hearts if you do have it if you're going to be honest with yourself let him who's wise that a wise man and endure with knowledge who shows forth his uh uh wisdom and knowledge to the meekness of wisdom in his life living out you know that that's one who's in that place where he's been endued with the kind of wisdom from above but if you don't have that this is what he says light glory not if you do have bitter envy in your hearts then glory not and lie not against the truth don't be arrogant and deny the truth just be honest and admit it that's the simple prescription if you have it in your heart then he says don't be arrogant don't glory in what is not true don't deny the truth or lie not against the truth just be honest and admit it and if we can be honest and admit it and resolve the begin to resolve these things in our hearts then we'll be able to see it and we won't respond in kind because it's one of the weaknesses that we have to overcome is that when we're met with the intensity of 10 from the devilish wisdom we respond with an intensity of 11 from devilish wisdom the sensual wisdom when what we need to respond with is the wisdom from above you meet me with the 12 in earthly wisdom i can just come at you with the one in wisdom from above and it can defuse the situation just admit it so if you want to turn to psalms 119 i want to read this chapter if you want to turn to second samuel 16. i believe i'm going to be able to use this entire chapter to tell us this story second samuel 16. i appreciate my wife being the only one that got that joke second samuel 16. i'm going to use this as something very practical to challenge ourselves well i'll uh i'll spare you i won't read the whole thing i'm going to read through verse 14. let's watch how these let's look at one man and see some differences here and this is at a time when absalom is uh wanting to take over the kingdom he wins the hearts of israel and so he david and his household flee as absolutely has deceived david it's a very difficult time for david a very troublesome part in israel's history it says and when dave was a little past the top of the hill behold siba the servant of mephibosheth met him and we know where david had restored to mephibosheth uh certain things and had blessed him and allowed him to eat at his table because he was the of the family of jonathan and so he met him with a couple of asses saddled upon them 200 loaves of bread and a hundred bunches of raisins and a hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine and the king said to seba what meanest thou by these and siba said the asses be for the king's household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink and the king said where is thy master son he wanted to know where mephibosheth is where's the family not just the servant where's the family and siba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem and now he puts words in mephibosheth's mouth for he said today shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father so siba is saying of mephibosheth that he's saying now that david is fleeing now my family can get this just reward and be restored back then said the king david says to see but behold thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth and siva said i humbly beseech that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king what's happened is david is met by this servant this one from the the servant of mephibosheth who greets him with these gifts and he's given them these gifts and david's like well where's mephibosheth shouldn't he agree to me this is my friend shouldn't he be the one that meets me and tries to refresh me and now siva says oh well he's kind of rejoicing at this predicament right now he's an ah he's our opportunist because he he stands to gain with you on the run and israel is going to restore the kingdom of israel the house of israel is going to restore to his family saul the family of saul the kingdom of his father that belonged to jonathan i'm going to get it back so david respond to that by saying you know what everything that's mephibosheth as the king i give it to you everything that belonged to him now in this instance that's a very extreme judgment by david right he's told this story this is what he hears and in this moment david acts very very quickly he's very quick to judge harshly and this is true of david he was a man of very excitable passions he always acted he acted very quickly he was his passions were easy to be excited and he acted upon them we won't read it but i want to refer to it in second samuel chapter 19 david meets mephibosheth and he gets his side of the story and he finds out that siba lied about him so here david has met with all this nice gifts and all these raisins and who wouldn't flip out over raisins and a bottle of wine and all all these different loaves of bread and he's all excited and he's like hey did mephibosheth bring this he's like no he actually thinks the kingdom's going to be restored to the house of his father and to saul and david immediately and is almost as if it's his anger says then whatever is his is yours now as a king i decree it you can have all of his estate all of his inheritance a few chapters later david actually meets with mesebeth and he has quite the conversation with me says hey you know what he lied to you that's not the case and david in a unique resolution of the situation says well you guys figured out you can have half you let them have half but siva lied to david and the scriptures warn us so many places to not judge too quickly does it not i'm just going to sow these seeds in here as we wrap this up it warns us so often not to judge too quickly it warns us about listening to false accusations and far too often we act like david without knowing the whole situation boom we just come down on it we give our opinion and really it's even worse because it's not that we don't know the whole situation what we know about the situation is full of lies and though we're constantly warned in scripture not to react quickly to not react without knowing the whole situation this this was david's knee-jerk reaction to judge very harshly in the face of this offensive news that this one did not his friend the one that he had been kind to the one that he had done all these good things too he hears this rumor about him he hears maybe what he thought was truth but he's very quick to act he's very harsh very excited in his passions but what's amazing we're at verse 4 this knee jerk reaction by david is immediately contrasted by his next response i find it so extraordinary because what i was drawn to is this next story but what god used for context is what happened with siba but now notice what happens so that we can relate more closely with david how it's easy for us to get only half the story and get all riled up and respond the wrong way but now notice where the real meekness of wisdom is exhibited and when david when king david came to bahrain the old fence by hiram behold fence came out a man of the family of the house of saul so now he's already had the seed sown into his head that saul's house is having a party because it looks like david's on the run the kingdom's going to be restored now comes a man from the house of saul whose name was shimmy the son of guerra he came forth and cursed still as he came as he leaves his house he was cursing and as he was coming he was cursing and he cast stones that david and at all the servants of the king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left catch this this man still held the grudge against david because of family loyalty he still had a grudge because in his heart he felt like saul deserved it all saul was the rightful king it should have been jonathan and he still had all this bitterness in his heart and because it was unresolved now he saw this king compromise he saw him in a bad situation and him holding this grudge because of his loyalty to his family he's bitter still after all these years against david i so bitter to where he just drew the blinds and turned his head and thumbed his nose at the procession as it walked by but left his house cursing continued to curse as he came and then he's throwing rocks at everybody this guy's mad he's hot under the sports caller as we might say he's given hot sports opinions about david and all his mighty men verse 7 and thus said shem me when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial we had some choice words for him didn't he think of all the negative nasty words he could use today to describe king david instead of below the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul implying that the blood of it was david's and not saul's own and whose stead thou has reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom in the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken and thy mischief because thou art a bloody man think about how hard this would have been for david to hear this in light of the fact that there's truths contained in this accusation that absalom his own son his own flesh and blood had turned against him to rest the kingdom away from him and now after he'd been told that mephibosheth had turned his back against him now shimmy comes out cursing and throwing rocks and stoning them and says these things you're a bloody man you're getting what you deserved and then said abhishey the son of syria under the king now that uh surya was a david's sister and it's very interesting that these three sons that are often mentioned in david's history are always related to the daughter and they're identified with the a dominating well i won't say that identified with the female spirit and said with the identity of their father indicating that something is wrong somewhere did i say i was going to be short tonight because this just blows this just blows wide open this is the abishai says why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head and you could you could see how a king would be like you know go ahead do that let's use one of my mighty men to exact vengeance and justice but then the king said what have i to do with ye you ye sons of syria though he had something to do with them these were his nephews but he says so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so and david said to abasha and to all his servants behold my son which came forth from my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjaminite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him it may be that the lord will look on my affliction and that the lord will requite me with good for this cursing this day think about how differently he responds now in the face of false accusations mixed with some truth versus how he responded to siba you would think it would be in the same vein you'd think that it would be of the same character but here david is innocent of the accusations being innocent of the accusations he didn't need to be quick to defend he didn't say yeah you go after that liar you know i'm not a bloody man you go cut his head off but wisdom held to humility and even in the way that david speaks it's that of a broken man who perhaps is thinking of his own mistakes we ever want to get real self-righteous and we want to get all indignant and we want to start wishing harm and pain and tragic tragedy on other people just think about what you would be if you got what you deserved rightfully conclude that you'd be a dead man maybe you take a step back a little bit and be like david because his response evidenced a deep humble resignation is a response of a spirit of one that was subject to god and i believe that god brought these sons of syria up in this picture he brought them up in a way to bring these two this wrestling that was within david because these sons were david's nephews and you look at the story of their lives they were selfishly ambitious and they were power hungry and they wanted position and they were willing to do whatever it take took to get it and keep it and their testimonies and their stories throughout the history of david it shows that their arrogant nature always proved to be revengeful and spiteful and evil to the point where it was grievous to david and in these sons these nephews of david in this abbasid this one it represents our worst instincts and our worst nature maybe the worst things of our past david even said this in second samuel 3 39 i am as king and i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of surya be too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness david is acknowledging their wicked ambition he's saying these guys are too much for me even though anointed to be king they're so self-assertive they're so brash they're they they want so much power they're they're always willing to do this and to do that david found himself always giving in to them and even though he was conscious of their wicked ambition he still gave them authority still gave them permission position and even let them become rulers in israel even though he knew better what did it represent that part of david but in chapter 16 second samuel chapter 16 david finally overthrows the influence of pride and selfish ambition finally he looks at it and says what do i have to do with you it's in that moment whereas in times past this is how i would have responded in times past i would have acted even as i did to abigail i would have acted easily as i did to uh um to your i would have acted in a way that was clearly through passion and through excitement even as i was maybe he was even reminded of how he just overreacted just earlier to me february's servant and how he responded well take away his kingdom maybe dave was still carrying this guilt and this conviction so when he's finally met with this he says you know what perhaps god told him to do it even now as he curses me and spits at me and mistreats me maybe if i take it quietly the lord would require me good for this cursing because you know what at the end of the day i probably deserved it this is what his wisdom did and this is what our wisdom will do it'll turn reproaches into reproofs what could be a reproach you just say you know what i'm willing to see if that shoe fits i'm willing to be examined by it and when you can turn a reproach into reproof then you can be benefited by them instead of being provoked by them when we're being provoked by them that's not wisdom from above but when we find a way to take even a nasty insult and be benefited by it now that's wisdom wouldn't that be awesome to be able to take away all the nasty filthy vile things the devil tries to do to us and we just can kind of turn it around and it becomes a benefit so every wicked scheme everything he does you just keep getting benefited by it how do you do it with wisdom a wise man endued with knowledge takes the very attack in the of the enemy and is able to turn it around for good and realize i'm not going to let myself be provoked in this instance i'm not going to respond in the flesh i'm not going to meet his intensity with the same kind of ferocity i'm just going to live above it musicians if you'd come i want to read these last two verses i could put it this way in the midst of all the trials that come upon us maybe even the desertion of family and friends like david if we could just bear them meekly the problem is all too often self-righteousness clings fast to us and it's through that that we would express an indignation and a defensiveness what happens is we forget that our lord reigneth if we could connect the providence of god to all that happens then the smallest daily trouble will no longer completely upset us if we somehow allow the providence of god to be disconnected from our lives we'll daily be losing our temper daily flying off the handle daily getting defensive daily walk acting in the flesh but if we can be meek we can take these things patiently and so then as david and his men went by the way shemi went along on the hillside over against them and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust and the king and all the people that were with them came weary they were exhausted they were faint the bible says and but i want to say but refreshed themselves there they found reviving in their spirits means they actually found new life invigoration in their souls and their spirits and their attitudes they were lifted up think how different it would have been if david had been provoked to slaughter think how different it would have been of hatred and jealousy and malice overwhelmed the king in that instance and he acted at the behest of abishai why don't you just let me take his head off and just what kind of spirit would have went through david and his men but because david was not provoked and he showed the meekness of wisdom though weary they were able to refresh themselves this is where we find rest for our souls not in fighting but in resting not in trying but entrusted it's not going to be found in all the efforts we can do to prove i remember one time going through a difficult situation and a pastor contacted me and he said you know what you need to do you need to get your story out you need to let everyone know your side of the story i was listening okay continue and he says you you do you remember why michael dukakis won the presidential election that one year and i'm like no i don't and the point was because he allowed the republican convention to get out a bunch of false stories about him and he never said anything he never rebuttaled he never put out an ad he never he never you're such a forceful vengeful lie and since he never responded to it he just kind of conducted himself above it that's why he lost so what you need to do is you need to do what michael dukakis didn't and i'm thinking yeah this is wisdom from above you could take this to the bank thanks karl rove didn't know you had my number what is it that's the carnal instinct but what would the what would what could we learn from david the battle is not minus the lord's let all my enemies draw their swords and gather in the valley of oh no and say come on come on meet me let's work this thing out and say i'm sorry i'm busy on the wall i've got a job to do i've got a home to build i've got a wife to lift up i've got children to rear i've got a job to do i don't have time to draw my sword with you and quibble in the valley that's the meekness of wisdom and all too often we lose our rest because we're operating off of the sensual devilish earthly earthy wisdom from beneath so if any man have this strife in the hearts james says glory not and lie not against the truth all we have to do to say tonight is god i'm sorry i'm putting my sword back up i'm coming back to you with a hammer in my hand and i got work to do and let's get to work could we stand to our feet tonight this is where we'll find our refreshing and a wisdom from above [Music] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer lord jesus tonight as we close this service and soon dismiss the people very it's a very um [Music] pointed subject tonight maybe not much time to ponder and reflect upon it it's one that lifted up the same principle over and over again the meekness of wisdom what does wisdom look like it's the word in action it's the word in action in humility lord that's how we're going to overcome that's how any wrongs in our life are going to be made right that's how we're going to face the challenges that are in our lives lord i pray that tonight you would help us to just surrender and yield to this power which is beyond ourselves lord if there's bitter envious strife in our hearts that there's politics that's overwhelmed us and restricted us and restrained us lord let us be free from it right now that it no longer impair our thinking no longer impair our health but be delivered from it lord and enjoy the health of the wisdom from above in the wealth that is in the wisdom from above bless your people tonight as i commit them to you knowing that your grace is enough it is sufficient we love you father thank you for your goodness in the word which you've impressed upon our hearts the word which you've preserved in scripture and delivered in this message lord we believe it we're walking according to it may it bring fruit forth fruit lord we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen how do we overcome brother braham said all by the word and humility he says oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example the meek and lowly one that's who we make our example isn't it grand to be a christian isn't it wonderful to have a five-star general who's not pointing you in the wrong direction not teaching you to war when it's not wise but the one who's who can teach us how to be successful in conflict that's the one that i'm yielding to thank you for your patience and listening tonight god bless you we've appreciated it
