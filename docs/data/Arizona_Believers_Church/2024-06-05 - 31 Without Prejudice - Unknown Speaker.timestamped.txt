[0:00] I I hope to be able to explore that uh
[0:02] in some detail today without having to
[0:05] go back and read this uh parable of the
[0:09] Good Samaritan and perhaps what my
[0:12] desire would be that you would be able
[0:14] to make some connections yourself with
[0:17] the story especially since it's so
[0:19] familiar to us I want to give a summary
[0:22] I'm picking up on some things that we
[0:23] didn't get to on Sunday so I want to
[0:25] give a summary of these last few
[0:27] Services we've been ministering on a
[0:28] humble home and a home of honor and
[0:30] we've been uh using that phrasing and
[0:34] some specifics to highlight these uh
[0:37] certain characteristics that make a
[0:38] house a home very core core values or
[0:41] things that make up the kind of
[0:43] character uh that pleases the Lord and
[0:45] where his honors pleased to dwell and we
[0:48] use the parable of the unjust Steward
[0:50] who acted selfishly acted for his own
[0:52] benefit he was shrewd for only his own
[0:55] interest and it impressed his master he
[0:59] he was like that was a pretty slick move
[1:01] you looked out after yourself that was
[1:03] pretty shrewd you got one over on me but
[1:05] still it was self-serving and
[1:07] self-protective was only acting in his
[1:09] own interest and it's that Parable that
[1:12] provoked the Pharisees to kind of resent
[1:15] Jesus because he said you know you can't
[1:16] serve God and Mammon and he's saying you
[1:19] can't you can't serve riches and pursue
[1:21] riches and pursue Christ at the same
[1:22] time or Su pursue God at the same time
[1:25] and so the the Pharisees because they
[1:27] were cous and they wanted and they
[1:29] lusted for money and for wealth and
[1:31] popularity and all the things that go
[1:33] with it uh they resented him and even
[1:36] began to chide him and ridicule him so
[1:38] then Jesus gives the parable of the rich
[1:41] man in Lazarus and here's this rich man
[1:43] who has everything that the world could
[1:44] offer and a beggar lays at his gate and
[1:48] uh the rich man disregards him never
[1:50] ministers to him in his need and they
[1:52] both die Lazareth goes to the bosom of
[1:54] Abraham the rich man goes to hell and is
[1:56] tormented and he's showing the heart of
[1:59] the Pharisees this he's rebuking the
[2:00] Pharisee and he's saying the rich man in
[2:03] Hell lifts up his eyes and sees Lazarus
[2:05] and instead of repenting from missing
[2:07] the mark he says could Lazarus come and
[2:09] show mercy on me in the Gates of Hell uh
[2:12] in my torment unlike what I did to him
[2:15] he it's not no self-awareness whatsoever
[2:18] to say uh man I really missed the mark
[2:20] but he asked for Lazarus to come and
[2:22] comfort him in his torment and again
[2:24] this is one Jesus is using this Parable
[2:27] to address that self-serving
[2:29] self-protecting
[2:30] selfish attitude where one is only
[2:32] concerned about themselves and they even
[2:35] act religiously and act towards God and
[2:38] others to preserve their own testimony
[2:40] or make themselves look good so it
[2:42] really hits a lot at just this theater
[2:44] of the Optics of being a Christian and
[2:48] we've contrasted this selfish nature
[2:50] with the idea of being selfless living
[2:52] for others that's eternal life that's
[2:54] what Christ did he laid down his life we
[2:56] likewise are to take up the cross of
[2:58] self-denial and give and give abundantly
[3:01] as God gives to us we give out of what
[3:03] we've been given and that we're to be
[3:05] concerned more with the needs of others
[3:07] than our own selves and not be worried
[3:10] about about advancing our own interests
[3:12] But realize that as a Christian if I
[3:14] work to help others and make somebody
[3:16] else's life a little bit better and
[3:17] spread joy and and assist and give Aid
[3:20] that that's I'm doing this unto the Lord
[3:23] and he'll watch out over me and I'm not
[3:25] going to be double-minded in this I'm
[3:27] going to trust God that if I'm serving
[3:28] him and doing him right according to his
[3:31] word that he will take care of me and so
[3:34] we used humility as kind of a an
[3:38] important component to this where you
[3:40] don't have this inflated view of
[3:42] yourself and you don't think more of
[3:43] yourself than you ought to and you kind
[3:45] of have a modest view of your own
[3:46] importance and you're willing to do
[3:48] something because it's like that's not
[3:49] really beneath me I there's no Pride
[3:52] here I don't mind doing that and so
[3:54] you're you're not the narcissist where
[3:55] you're always looking down on people and
[3:57] critical so you don't have this sense of
[3:59] entitlement you don't have this attitude
[4:01] of of well it's my right and I me first
[4:04] but there's this deferring and I had a
[4:06] brother reach out to me and says man
[4:07] your sermon has been the talk of our
[4:10] family since Sunday it's constantly
[4:12] being mentioned and I'm kind of
[4:14] thinking this is great keep texting let
[4:18] it flow and it's like yeah it's like
[4:20] constantly you should prefer your
[4:21] brother you should prefer your sister
[4:23] and so I just kind of wrote back and
[4:24] said well perhaps not in this in a
[4:26] positive light that I would have wanted
[4:27] but nonetheless it's getting some air
[4:29] time
[4:30] but we should have an attitude of
[4:32] preferring one another and it's even the
[4:35] willingness to shed your own rights for
[4:37] the rights of somebody else uh if if if
[4:40] necessary it's just this respect that
[4:42] every person is due and and I've been
[4:46] thinking a lot about uh the the idea of
[4:49] do unto others as you would have them do
[4:50] unto you and the principle of of the the
[4:55] way don't be a hypocrite if if you would
[4:57] want if I would want you to treat me a
[4:59] certain way I should probably uh be the
[5:02] same way uh towards somebody else and so
[5:04] there's this idea of just giving someone
[5:06] their due and what's what's considerate
[5:08] and in Romans 12:10 it says be kindly
[5:11] affectioned one to another with
[5:13] Brotherly Love in honor preferring one
[5:17] another this kindly affectioned toward
[5:20] one another with brotherly love it's
[5:22] genuine it's authentic it's not for show
[5:24] it's not just putting on this pretense
[5:26] and just saying well we've been told to
[5:28] love everybody and but if I could really
[5:30] give him a piece of my mind I would it's
[5:32] actually getting to a place to where
[5:33] it's not hypocrisy to do good it's not
[5:37] for pretense to labor in the right
[5:39] things and it's just real genuine it's
[5:41] genuine from your heart even if there is
[5:43] an offense or even if there is something
[5:45] very difficult to wrestle with you've
[5:47] gotten to a place in your walk with God
[5:49] where it's like I can I'm looking past
[5:51] that and I see a bigger picture I see a
[5:53] greater need and I can be kindly
[5:55] affectioned one to another and then in
[5:57] honor preferring one another it's
[6:00] allowing putting other needs before our
[6:02] own and giving preference to somebody
[6:04] else for their sake knowing that God
[6:06] looks out after you and you're sure in
[6:08] his promise towards you so you don't
[6:10] have to try to cut corners and cheat and
[6:11] preserve for yourself you could even
[6:13] look at it from the standpoint of I
[6:15] don't know where they are with God I
[6:17] don't know where their faith is with God
[6:18] I I don't know if they can have the same
[6:20] peace I would have in this situation so
[6:23] let me help them in their weakness and
[6:26] in what they're going through cuz I know
[6:27] God will take care of me and maybe if if
[6:29] I could do something for them it'll
[6:31] encourage their faith a little bit more
[6:32] so that when they're in that position
[6:34] the next time their hands not out but
[6:35] their hands are together praying or
[6:37] they're up rejoicing and thanking God
[6:39] knowing that the blessing's coming
[6:41] because what's get what has put us in
[6:42] that position to Aid and to serve and to
[6:45] be empathetic towards others when
[6:46] they're suffering is we've been there
[6:48] before God met us in our needs and
[6:51] sometimes we find ourselves talking to
[6:53] people and they're really really going
[6:54] through it and we're like you just
[6:55] should believe the promises of God and
[6:56] God's going to come to your Aid and
[6:58] God's going to do this and this is going
[6:59] to happen
[7:00] and you speak so freely and boldly about
[7:02] what God can do and you're thinking
[7:04] where was all this 5 years ago when I
[7:06] was going through it but it's it's
[7:08] that's because you've lived it and they
[7:10] need to hear it and we're there for one
[7:12] another preferring one another brother
[7:13] bam said we must live for others
[7:16] Christian Life is a life that lives for
[7:20] others now I had a lot more to go to I
[7:22] just I kind of skipped a lot because
[7:24] there had been that statement in the
[7:25] church age book where God says the
[7:27] people of God are not Material material
[7:29] minded but they're christm minded and it
[7:32] was approaching it from that standpoint
[7:34] that um the majority of Christians are
[7:37] not wealthy they're but they're rather
[7:38] they're on the Poor Side and so a rich
[7:41] man is rich in God not in worldly things
[7:45] and we were using that to uh emphasize
[7:48] not trusting in wealth privilege or
[7:50] opportunity uh not thinking that we're
[7:52] better than other people and
[7:53] disregarding the needs of others and
[7:55] just this General attitude of no
[7:57] hypocrisy but honesty and and certain
[8:00] things within the home and within our
[8:01] own individual lives to where we can be
[8:04] Bears of the presence of God and so
[8:05] we've dealt a lot with our attitude
[8:07] towards possessions and wealth and money
[8:09] and riches and so I I mentioned that uh
[8:12] in light of The Parables we've been
[8:13] using to remember those elements as we
[8:15] go forward now tonight my title is
[8:18] without
[8:19] prejudice and this is a legal phrase
[8:21] that's how I'm typically uh familiar
[8:24] with it is this phrase without prejudice
[8:26] and I'm wanting to put a greater
[8:28] microscope on that Pharisee spirit that
[8:31] Jesus is rebuking and hopefully by
[8:34] addressing this part of the Pharisee
[8:36] Spirit that's been called out and and
[8:38] this these other Parables it it we can
[8:41] identify how this attitude this this
[8:43] idea of prejudice hurts us in our home
[8:45] life and our relationships with other
[8:48] people now if we could just keep this
[8:50] slide here until we maybe get to our
[8:51] next uh uh
[8:54] statement uh Prejudice is maybe to use
[8:58] maybe a fancy word is for judg judement
[8:59] or judging
[9:01] beforehand it's a preconceived opinion
[9:03] if you have a Prejudice you have a
[9:06] you're leaning towards one side of
[9:08] something for a reason other than your
[9:10] conviction of of what's right or Justice
[9:13] or or seeing the totality of evidence
[9:15] and saying uh this is a just conviction
[9:17] you if you have Prejudice even before
[9:19] you hear all the facts even before you
[9:22] really know the situation you have some
[9:24] reason to already take a
[9:26] side and that's what makes you Prejudice
[9:29] we you with me so far and so it a bias
[9:32] if you've heard that word before it's
[9:34] that one-sided tendency of the mind you
[9:35] have a bias towards something and a bias
[9:38] is like an undo Prejudice you just you
[9:40] lean that way you're you align yourself
[9:42] in a particular way it's called a bias
[9:44] and when you have this bias it kind of
[9:47] assumes that it's this undue Prejudice
[9:49] often without evidence like why are you
[9:52] partial to that that's just your
[9:54] inclination that's your you have this
[9:56] prejudgment you haven't heard all the
[9:58] facts you've decided it before
[9:59] beforehand and the word prejudice it's
[10:02] rooted in this idea of spite or contempt
[10:06] the meaning of the word prejudice and
[10:08] the prefixes and uh the the the wording
[10:11] in even different languages there's some
[10:13] harm or damage some hurt with
[10:16] prejudice if if the opinion was without
[10:19] effect maybe it's not Prejudice it's
[10:21] just a difference of opinion but this
[10:23] for judgment or bias this uh undue
[10:26] Prejudice indicates some Harmon damage
[10:30] in the violation of someone's right that
[10:33] you if you have a Prejudice toward
[10:35] something it's not an innocent well I
[10:38] prefer this place over this place but
[10:41] it's a it's it's a not just a preference
[10:43] but the Prejudice means in coming to
[10:45] that decision and viewing it that way
[10:47] it's some harm to that individual or it
[10:49] deprives them of some right or respect
[10:52] that they otherwise should have just as
[10:54] a human being and it has its roots as I
[10:58] said in this idea of cont tempt now when
[11:00] we were preaching on A House Divided
[11:03] cannot stand and we were looking at
[11:05] those different aspects we talked about
[11:07] just very briefly how contempt is one of
[11:09] the single greatest indicators of a
[11:12] relationship headed to a breakup that in
[11:14] a marriage one of the single greatest
[11:16] indicators of a divorce is when two
[11:18] people have contempt one for another and
[11:21] when you have contempt for somebody you
[11:24] look down on them so the Prejudice isn't
[11:27] like a compliment like I just think
[11:28] you're just don't know why I don't have
[11:30] any evidence but I just think you're
[11:31] better than me it would just be the idea
[11:33] of deciding beforehand without evidence
[11:35] that somebody else is beneath you or
[11:37] worthless deserves ridicule or doesn't
[11:40] deserve something that they otherwise
[11:43] would have some right to or are you
[11:45] deprived them of some justice or some
[11:48] Equity or fairness because you are
[11:51] prejudicial towards them maybe
[11:53] discrimination could be a word that we
[11:55] could have looked at a little bit but
[11:56] the word that kept coming to me is
[11:58] bigotry
[12:00] and uh it has a very interesting
[12:02] etymology and that's not the study of
[12:04] insects but it it has some real
[12:07] interesting history but it's an
[12:09] obstinate or unreasonable attachment to
[12:12] a Creed or opinion and thereby being
[12:15] intolerant of others so if there's a
[12:18] bigotry it's unreasonable it's a real
[12:20] stubborn attachment to some idea some
[12:22] judgment some opinion and intolerance of
[12:26] others and there's I just felt like it
[12:28] was so aligned with bias and this idea
[12:31] of prejudice to where you have some
[12:33] preconceived idea some you formed an
[12:36] opinion beforehand you're closed-minded
[12:39] you're stubborn and it'll it causes you
[12:41] to be very intolerant or reject full of
[12:44] others uh their opinions or their
[12:46] situation judgmental their situation and
[12:48] you would withhold something that's due
[12:50] to them I'm not really zeroing in on
[12:53] your faces and maybe I'm afraid to but
[12:55] just trust that everybody's with me so
[12:57] far and and you're not getting nervous
[13:00] that you're going to get a a sermon on
[13:02] being
[13:03] woke but I do think there's a lot here
[13:05] for us to consider now if we talk about
[13:07] bigotry we should refer we should uh
[13:09] make known the
[13:11] bigot and it's a sanctimonious person
[13:14] and the the history of the word bigot we
[13:17] might think a bigot is somebody who's uh
[13:19] racist against somebody or a bigot uh
[13:21] maybe we associate with a misogynist but
[13:24] a bigot in its wording it's a
[13:27] sanctimonious person who is a Rel
[13:29] religious
[13:30] hypocrite a bigot is a religious
[13:33] hypocrite it's one who is sanctimonious
[13:35] and I know we need the definition for
[13:37] sanctimonious it's making a show of
[13:39] sanctity one who makes a show of being
[13:41] Sanctified one who makes a show of being
[13:43] holy one who makes a show of being right
[13:44] where they're affecting affecting the
[13:47] appearance of
[13:48] Holiness so a bigot is somebody who
[13:50] tries to appear holy but is actually
[13:54] inwardly evil inwardly unclean so in the
[13:57] modern language Jesus was have said
[13:59] scribes Pharisees
[14:01] bigots because that's what they were
[14:04] they gave the appearance of Holiness but
[14:07] they were religious Hypocrites so now
[14:11] without prejudice when I say without
[14:14] prejudice it's withholding judgment or
[14:18] opinion it's acting without injury loss
[14:22] or
[14:23] damnation and when it comes to the legal
[14:26] phrase has anybody ever been in some
[14:28] situation where a cause of action was
[14:31] dismissed without prejudice anybody
[14:34] anybody I'm looking for new
[14:35] clients because if something is dealt
[14:38] with in litigation and it's done without
[14:41] prejudice that means that I've de I've
[14:43] dismissed this or there's a ruling and
[14:46] without prejudice means it does not
[14:48] infringe on my right to subsequently
[14:51] bring that cause of action again or Sue
[14:53] again so I could sue Brother Scott for
[14:56] no reason whatsoever and and then after
[14:58] the law lawsuits already started I could
[15:00] ask for a motion to dismiss and ask for
[15:02] it to be dismissed without prejudice
[15:04] meaning if I want to sue him again I
[15:06] have a right to sue so no uh no rights
[15:09] are being taken away from me I still
[15:12] have Justice made available to me but if
[15:14] something is dismissed with prejudice it
[15:16] deprives you of ever bringing that cause
[15:18] of action again I if something's
[15:21] dismissed with prejudice it's
[15:22] essentially like a final decision on
[15:24] that claim and your right to sue or get
[15:27] something out of it has been taken away
[15:30] and I've probably made a mess of this by
[15:31] bringing the law into it but what so
[15:34] what I mean by without prejudice is you
[15:36] are preserving somebody's right that you
[15:39] are being respectful of themselves and
[15:41] their journey and their experiences and
[15:43] what they're going through and so you
[15:45] withhold judgment you withhold damnation
[15:47] you withhold HHH harm you you don't act
[15:50] in a way that injures them or causes
[15:52] them lost so you're preserving a
[15:55] person's rights you're respectful of
[15:57] their rights and I'm not just talking
[15:59] about their rights as an American I'm
[16:00] not just talking about their rights a as
[16:02] a human being I'm talking about their
[16:04] rights as a child of God their
[16:07] opportunity that they should have as a
[16:09] Christian to Mercy and Grace and an
[16:11] opportunity to know the love of God so
[16:14] without prejudice we're dealing with
[16:16] prejudice uh discrimination bias bigotry
[16:20] and these certain
[16:22] attitudes that hinder Us in cultivating
[16:27] the right kind of atmospheres in our
[16:28] relationship a ships in in our home how
[16:31] many of here here have ever heard of
[16:32] Francis
[16:33] Bacon I'm not talking about fried bacon
[16:37] or anything like that but if you want to
[16:38] get a crowd's attention just start
[16:40] talking about
[16:41] bacon I had just thought about that you
[16:43] know fry onions and cook bacon and the
[16:44] house smells great maybe we should just
[16:46] kind of do that here fry onions in the
[16:50] pre-service but Francis Bacon in his uh
[16:53] work novin organum and that's a a
[16:56] shortening of the full title but there's
[16:57] too much Latin for me
[16:59] but in 1620 he wrote this and it's so
[17:02] profound as to what I'm trying to share
[17:05] I hope you can catch this because we're
[17:06] talking about Prejudice and bias and he
[17:08] says for what a man had rather were true
[17:12] he more readily
[17:14] believes you listening we going to get a
[17:16] lot out of this what you want to be true
[17:19] you're more quickly to accept as
[17:22] true what what you want to see you're
[17:25] you're it's easier for you to see it and
[17:28] this is very critical for us when
[17:30] sometimes we form opinions or judgments
[17:31] even with respect to the message what
[17:33] you want to believe is true it's easier
[17:35] for us to readily believe that which we
[17:38] would rather be true therefore he
[17:41] rejects difficult things from impatience
[17:43] of
[17:45] research through that hardship if it's
[17:47] if it's difficult to understand you just
[17:49] reject it because you don't want to you
[17:50] don't want to put in the hard work now
[17:51] I'm not so much looking at this from a
[17:53] spiritual standpoint but just a a human
[17:55] nature in general you reject sober
[17:57] things because they narrow hope I just
[18:00] thought that was profound you'll you'll
[18:02] reject things that are uh uh that limit
[18:05] your opportunities or kind of narrow
[18:06] down the options because you don't like
[18:08] that because it reduces your
[18:10] expectations or belief that there could
[18:12] be
[18:12] more they reject the deeper things of
[18:15] nature from Superstition the light of
[18:18] experience from arrogance and pride lest
[18:20] his mind should seem to be occupied with
[18:22] things mean and transitory things not
[18:25] commonly believed you reject out of
[18:27] deference to the opinion of the vulgar
[18:29] he says numberless in short are the ways
[18:31] and sometimes imperceptible in which the
[18:34] affections color and infect the
[18:38] understanding it's all about the
[18:40] Prejudice the bias the preconceived
[18:43] notions and
[18:44] opinions and Francis Bacon was uh he was
[18:48] a devout
[18:49] Anglican and um a Christian and as I was
[18:53] reading some of his other works this
[18:54] week he made this statement I just want
[18:56] to share this and it kind of was a late
[18:57] addition to my note but he said the
[19:00] causes and I'm reading this just so you
[19:01] could be hear the color in his words is
[19:04] one who's not he's not seeking
[19:06] abandonment to reason and science but he
[19:08] was a huge proponent of Science and even
[19:11] the the cover of this book it uses a
[19:12] scripture in Daniel that they shall set
[19:14] out and travel and gain knowledge and
[19:17] and that that there was that all any
[19:20] research and search for knowledge should
[19:22] only confirm the truth of the scripture
[19:24] and should always align up with the
[19:26] Divine so it wasn't it wasn't science as
[19:27] we know it today
[19:29] but he says the causes of atheism are
[19:32] divisions in religion if they be many
[19:36] for any one main division addeth Zeal to
[19:40] both sides so if religion is just
[19:42] separated into two it just we take our
[19:44] sides right we get very very zealous but
[19:46] many divisions introduces
[19:49] atheism so profound that the cause of
[19:53] causes of atheism divisions in religion
[19:55] that if you can divide it enough people
[19:57] resort to just rejecting God totally
[20:00] another cause of atheism is the scandal
[20:03] of
[20:04] priest when it came to that which St
[20:06] Bernard says one cannot now say the
[20:09] priest is of the people for the truth is
[20:11] that the people are not as bad as the
[20:14] priest and this is true now even more so
[20:17] of
[20:18] Christianity that it's popular say it's
[20:20] a popular saying among atheists that the
[20:22] Christians are the most UN Christlike
[20:24] people on
[20:26] Earth and third is the custom of profane
[20:29] scoffing in holy matters which does by
[20:32] little and little deface the reverence
[20:34] of religion so just scoffing at religion
[20:37] the scoffing at Holy things just it
[20:39] Waters down religion and the last thing
[20:41] that causes atheism is learned times
[20:44] especially with peace and
[20:46] prosperity he said for troubles and
[20:48] adversities do more bow men's Minds to
[20:51] religion so he he had some insight he
[20:55] had some conviction of the truth of God
[20:57] and the absoluteness of scripture
[20:59] and he was very concerned about the word
[21:02] of God being Mis misrepresented through
[21:04] the priest to who uh defile the people
[21:07] and and live profanely and it caused
[21:09] people to say the priesthood is not as
[21:12] the people because the people are better
[21:13] than the priesthood and it would lead
[21:15] one to reject truth and how that the
[21:17] divisions in religion that as the more
[21:20] you divide up the truth the more he
[21:22] introduces atheism just to whol Cale
[21:24] reject Christ and so coming back to the
[21:28] idea of
[21:29] Prejudice he says that a man had rather
[21:32] accept something as true what he already
[21:35] believes and if he has some sort of
[21:37] prejudice already that's what he's going
[21:39] to defer to that's what he's going to
[21:41] lean
[21:42] into now this is going to be a really
[21:44] hard turn but turn to James chapter 2:
[21:47] 1-9 that's my foundation on Prejudice
[21:51] opinions
[21:53] and uh introducing the concept of a bias
[21:57] and even this undo Prejudice where
[22:00] there's this contempt for other people
[22:01] classes of people even another person
[22:04] James chapter 2: 1-9 my brethren have
[22:07] not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ
[22:10] the lord of God with respect of persons
[22:14] this came to mind when I was studying on
[22:15] the story of the rich man in Lazarus or
[22:18] Devas as he his attitude towards the
[22:20] poor man he would have looked down upon
[22:22] him and because of his wealth and
[22:24] privilege and opportunity he never
[22:26] thought to help Lazarus but when he had
[22:28] need he looked at Lazareth perhaps as a
[22:31] servant you know an Aaron boy bring me
[22:32] some water take care of me in my need
[22:35] and so it was this respect of persons
[22:37] where one person is preferred over
[22:39] another and that's this scripture has
[22:41] been in my notes the last couple
[22:42] services that we hadn't had a chance to
[22:44] get to so do not have uh Faith with
[22:47] respect to persons for if there come
[22:49] unto your assembly a man with the gold
[22:52] ring in goodly apparel and there come in
[22:55] also a poor man in Vile reignment I
[22:58] don't if anything anyone has ever worn
[23:00] here has been called vile reignment or
[23:02] maybe goodly apparel at that but you
[23:05] know he saying if anyone comes amongst
[23:06] your fellowship and one dresses nice and
[23:09] the other one is is looking more poor
[23:12] maybe they're not dressed in a pleasing
[23:15] way to the eye he says and ye have
[23:17] respect to him that weareth the gay
[23:19] clothing I don't know if we used that
[23:21] compliment either and saith unto him
[23:23] who's wearing the goodly apparel and the
[23:25] gold ring and the one who appears to be
[23:27] wealthy and has position and Prestige we
[23:30] say to him sit thou here in a good place
[23:34] make sure this guy sits right here next
[23:36] to brother Rowan so he can be on camera
[23:38] we want people to know that this ruler
[23:40] and this person is visiting and so we
[23:43] appreciate you chase sitting next to
[23:45] Rowan so everyone knows we get the
[23:48] celebrities here but there's a I only
[23:51] said that because Rowan starts reaching
[23:52] over there
[23:53] poking Chase like H sit thou at my right
[23:57] hand there's a you you know exactly
[24:01] what's happening and I've seen this
[24:03] happen in churches it's really overseas
[24:05] where in some places the governor or the
[24:08] mayor will attend the services or come
[24:10] and this is in Africa and and when this
[24:12] happens you know maybe for a lot more
[24:14] reasons than the fact that he's wearing
[24:15] gay clothing you're like come sit at the
[24:18] front and you make a show of it and you
[24:20] acknowledge the dignitaries and how many
[24:22] ministers do we have here today I'd
[24:24] never heard anyone say how many lay
[24:26] people are here tonight right preachers
[24:28] and pastors and missionaries and you
[24:30] acknowledge uh the important people and
[24:33] so he's kind of touching on human nature
[24:35] that still exists today that one person
[24:37] gets special treatment but the other
[24:39] person you say stand thou there or sit
[24:43] here under my foot
[24:44] stol go over here to the Wayside or you
[24:47] be my servant and you create this cast
[24:49] system within the house of God where
[24:51] somebody is deserving of attention and
[24:53] special treatment and the other one is
[24:55] essentially disregarded and trust me the
[24:57] one in the vial arment will feel vile
[25:00] and the one in the gay uh clothing is
[25:02] going to feel
[25:03] good but then James has this Stark
[25:06] rebuke are you not then partial in
[25:09] yourselves and are become judges of evil
[25:12] thoughts in other words you have
[25:15] unrighteous thoughts you have Prejudice
[25:18] you have bias in your mind simply
[25:21] because this man dresses good and this
[25:23] man dresses bad and you've made the
[25:25] decision this one needs to be at the
[25:26] foot stol this one needs to be over here
[25:28] this one needs to be preferred this one
[25:29] needs to have the best seat he says you
[25:30] have become judges with perverted
[25:33] judgment you've judged beforehand you've
[25:36] said this man deserves special treatment
[25:38] this man deserves unspecial treatment
[25:41] all because you've become partial in
[25:43] yourselves so he says hearken my beloved
[25:45] Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of
[25:48] this world rich in faith and Heirs of
[25:51] the Kingdom which Heath promised to them
[25:53] that love
[25:54] him as brother brandham said most of
[25:57] God's children
[25:59] are usually the majority of Christians
[26:00] are not wealthy but rather they are on
[26:02] the Poor
[26:03] Side he says but ye have despised the
[26:06] poor you've judged them incorrectly
[26:09] you've been a bigot towards them because
[26:12] you put on the pretense of religion and
[26:14] religion pure and undefiled is to vidle
[26:16] the Widow in her Affliction a a and to
[26:18] show this hospitality and kindness to
[26:20] those who are less fortunate and here
[26:22] you have this attitude of well this is
[26:24] really just all for show because when it
[26:26] comes down to it I'm given an opport to
[26:28] show Mercy to someone who really needs
[26:30] it I say you sit here at my foot stol
[26:32] and you're kind and nice to the one who
[26:34] gives you more
[26:36] Advantage you've despised the poor he
[26:38] says do not rich men oppress you and
[26:41] draw you before the Judgment
[26:44] seats he's say what what do these men of
[26:47] the world do to you what would they do
[26:49] if given the opportunity and the way
[26:51] sometimes we prefer celebrity and the
[26:53] way sometimes we show respect to worldly
[26:55] things or even well-known Ministries or
[26:57] different talk show host or podcast host
[27:00] a a and athletes or whatever it might be
[27:02] or politicians man we're just in awe of
[27:05] them and they would not hesitate to
[27:08] throw you under the bus if it did them
[27:10] good and they oppress the poor they
[27:12] oppress you they're not uh they're not
[27:16] acting to preserve your rights they're
[27:18] doing it for themselves he says do not
[27:21] they blaspheme that worthy Name by which
[27:23] you are
[27:24] called really wanting us to be mindful
[27:27] of man how is it sometimes we get drawn
[27:29] off sides to show favoritism that is
[27:33] essentially despising the less fortunate
[27:36] judging incorrectly you become judges of
[27:39] evil thoughts do not they blaspheme he
[27:41] says if you fulfill the Royal law
[27:44] according to the scripture Thou shalt
[27:46] love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well
[27:49] it's called The Royal law fulfilling the
[27:53] law of Christ Thou shalt love thy
[27:56] neighbor as thyself it sums up all the
[27:59] law and the prophets it can hang on this
[28:01] if we suppose the love for God in all
[28:03] respects heart soul and mind and thou
[28:06] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself he
[28:08] says then you're doing well when you
[28:09] fulfill the Royal law but if you have
[28:11] respect to persons ye commit
[28:14] sin and are convinced of the law as
[28:19] transgressors if we have Prejudice in
[28:22] our hearts if we have bias if we are
[28:26] scribes Pharisees big
[28:29] then we
[28:30] sin and we are convicted under the law
[28:33] as a
[28:35] transgressor brother brandham
[28:39] takes he's kind of referring to this he
[28:41] says now this is nothing against rich
[28:43] people because God can save a rich man
[28:45] and all the rich people said amen some
[28:48] of God's children are rich but money can
[28:50] be such a snare not only to those who
[28:52] have it but to those who don't have
[28:55] it catch that how it be comes a snare to
[28:59] those who have it and especially
[29:01] sometimes to those who don't have it
[29:03] because they want it way back there in
[29:06] the first age James cried out to those
[29:08] who were putting stock in wealthy people
[29:11] have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus
[29:13] Christ with respect of persons the poor
[29:15] there were trying to butter up the rich
[29:17] in order to get help rather than
[29:18] trusting in God I thought wow what a
[29:21] statement trying to advance themselves
[29:24] and even as the unjust Steward did in a
[29:26] sense whom you have one master that is
[29:29] God you have one that you ought to serve
[29:31] you cannot serve God in man but yet
[29:33] there was this effort to be shrewd and
[29:35] wise in the world to get an advantage in
[29:37] the world that you might be taken care
[29:39] of after worldly things and trying to
[29:41] get respect of the world instead of
[29:44] trusting in God don't do it says James
[29:47] don't do it money isn't everything money
[29:50] isn't the answer today it's not the
[29:53] answer either we have more wealth than
[29:55] we have ever had and yet less is being
[29:57] accomplished
[29:59] spiritually it is not with money that
[30:02] God works and this part to me is so
[30:04] critical to our thought in this series
[30:05] he moves by his spirit and that moving
[30:09] of the spirit comes only to a life
[30:11] consecrated to the
[30:14] word a man that is rich is rich in God
[30:17] not in worldly things a rich has come
[30:20] because his spirit moves in our lives
[30:22] and it moves because we have a life
[30:24] consecrated devoted partial to the word
[30:28] word so in fulfilling the Royal law Thou
[30:31] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself we do
[30:33] well but he says if you have respect of
[30:36] persons you
[30:38] sin this respect of persons is to
[30:41] prefer an
[30:43] ideal a scenario a person wealth or
[30:48] opportunity a and cater to that and give
[30:51] Credence to that and desire that at
[30:53] somebody else's
[30:54] expense that if we were to judge those
[30:57] who are spiritual in our church we might
[30:59] we what he's saying is that we would be
[31:01] quick to receive somebody who comes in
[31:03] amongst us that looks the part of a
[31:05] Christian that has things put together
[31:07] and I do believe that we would say wow
[31:09] this is a late model car and this is
[31:11] wearing new clothes and and he's got the
[31:15] nice shoes on and everything looks
[31:17] really nice and put well together that
[31:19] we would be more trusting and we'd be
[31:21] more open and be more accepting and
[31:24] maybe that's not wrong but our bias
[31:27] shows up that when someone comes who's
[31:29] not quite put together we're a little
[31:31] bit more uneasy a little bit more
[31:33] standoffish a little bit more suspicious
[31:35] we're less welcoming and warm and that
[31:38] exposes the
[31:39] bias because we've let some Optics or
[31:43] pretense uh we've been kind of
[31:45] Hoodwinked by that sanctimonious person
[31:47] and we're becoming sanctimonious
[31:48] ourselves we're kind of drawn into
[31:50] trying to play the part because maybe we
[31:52] think it could do us some good or we
[31:53] could maybe make some uh wow if this
[31:55] person starts coming maybe we could
[31:57] build a new church or whatever the
[31:58] thoughts might be it's for all the wrong
[32:00] reasons and you don't show
[32:02] kindness to the one who probably needs
[32:05] it the
[32:06] most there's so much in here that I'm
[32:10] just hoping you're picking up what I'm
[32:11] laying down without me belaboring some
[32:13] of these things and TI it all
[32:15] together if I could say this in the
[32:17] parable of the Good Samaritan the the
[32:19] priest and the
[32:20] levite show did not show compassion on a
[32:24] person in need and they passed by him
[32:28] and there was some because of the nature
[32:31] as Jesus is setting it up He is wanting
[32:34] to address this Prejudice that one would
[32:37] have towards a Samaritan and how they
[32:39] would narrowly construct their
[32:41] definition of neighbor to say that my
[32:43] neighbor would have to be only an
[32:45] Israelite who has not profaned the word
[32:47] my neighbor would have to be somebody in
[32:49] gay clothing my neighbor would have to
[32:51] be the priest himself or levac my
[32:53] neighbor would have to be one of the
[32:55] tribes of Benjamin or somebody else
[32:56] who's the Israelite who's in the faith
[32:58] my neighbor cannot be a Samaritan my
[33:00] neighbor cannot be a gentile I I I can't
[33:02] have some obligation outside of the
[33:04] household of this cult or this this
[33:06] group that were within uh so that I can
[33:09] justify myself when I uh look down on
[33:13] somebody and sneer at them in their need
[33:17] and say that guy probably asked for
[33:21] it and it
[33:23] is as we
[33:25] are addressing this Pharisees Spirit
[33:28] brother
[33:29] Bram well Jesus says woe we've taken a
[33:32] lot from Matthew 23 woe unto you scribes
[33:35] and Pharisees
[33:37] Hypocrites and job it says the
[33:39] Hypocrites in heart Heap up
[33:42] wrath they cry not when he bindeth
[33:47] them it's exactly
[33:50] what Devas did in
[33:52] hell he was cast into hell and being
[33:55] tormented and he doesn't cry for Mercy
[33:57] he doesn't ask for forgiveness he wants
[34:00] to be relieved of his
[34:01] torment he has no self-awareness to say
[34:04] I did this I made a I caused this and
[34:08] asked for forgiveness so the the
[34:09] Hypocrites are so blind to their state
[34:12] they're so they lack so much
[34:14] self-awareness of what their needs are
[34:17] and how much they lack they're they're
[34:18] so rich in so many things that they've
[34:20] taken comfort in the objects in the
[34:22] theater of playing the part that they're
[34:24] not in humility asking God for help
[34:27] they're not recognizing their poverty to
[34:29] come to the Lord to buy isab so that
[34:31] they can see in white rant that they
[34:33] might be clothed but he says the
[34:34] Hypocrites in heart Heap up
[34:37] wrath so if you're a hypocrite what
[34:40] strikes me what's amazing the Hypocrites
[34:42] in heart Heap up wrath the heart of a
[34:45] Pharisee is
[34:47] Prejudice the at the heart of a Pharisee
[34:50] is
[34:51] bigotry because they look down on and
[34:54] judge anything unlike them
[34:58] and this idea of they Heap the heart
[35:00] heaps up wrath it's this idea
[35:04] of where there's just this uh
[35:10] contempt brother Bram in the sermon
[35:12] identification and there's so many
[35:13] statements that can take this he says
[35:16] the Pharisees of that day took a stand
[35:18] against him because of
[35:21] prejudice that's the same thing they do
[35:23] today he says Nicodemus said the same
[35:26] thing he said Rabbi we know that you are
[35:27] teacher come from God but because of
[35:29] their Creeds and denominations wouldn't
[35:31] accept his message then they forbid
[35:33] anyone anybody else he said you won't go
[35:36] in yourself and you forbid others to go
[35:37] in what a condition I wonder if we could
[35:41] identify ourselves with something like
[35:43] that and he ask in this series of
[35:45] sermons around that time upon this
[35:47] particular subject and he he calls out
[35:49] the Prejudice in the heart of the
[35:51] Pharisees and their prejudgments and
[35:54] their bias and their bigotry and how in
[35:57] that they couldn't accept Jesus Christ
[35:59] even when Nicodemus who's among them
[36:01] would say you have the truth but we're
[36:03] not willing to accept
[36:04] it that they would rather things be true
[36:08] that they were more inclined to believe
[36:10] whatever they they they desire to be
[36:12] true they it's easier to
[36:14] believe this man looks like he could be
[36:16] from God and and maybe he is a rabbi
[36:18] maybe he's a master but what they wanted
[36:21] to believe is that he wasn't so it was
[36:22] easier to believe that he wasn't and
[36:24] brother brandham calls it out as
[36:26] Prejudice he said in the sermon
[36:28] indictment they knew that was the truth
[36:29] but because of jealousy
[36:33] Prejudice they had they thought more of
[36:35] themselves than they did of Jesus
[36:37] Christ now I
[36:40] wonder if Jesus was one of
[36:44] them what would have they
[36:49] thought if he dressed like them talked
[36:53] like him acted like him he is who he is
[36:56] but Mary and Joseph want something
[36:57] better for their son and and they found
[37:00] a good school to put him in so he goes
[37:01] to school with all the other rabins and
[37:03] he's he's learning with them and he sits
[37:05] under the same teachers and he comes up
[37:06] through the system and then once he gets
[37:08] to that place I wonder how easy it would
[37:10] have been for them just to accept him as
[37:13] this makes a lot of
[37:14] sense and the things that he would say
[37:16] and the things that he would do like man
[37:18] this guy he's one of us and his miracles
[37:21] uh make us more powerful and his
[37:22] Prestige makes us more uh more popular
[37:25] and I imagine he could have been the
[37:27] exact same teaching the exact same thing
[37:29] and doing the exact exact same things
[37:32] and been more accepted if he would have
[37:33] looked like them talked like them had
[37:35] the same background but the rumors the
[37:37] stains the the questions he looked poor
[37:41] he looked he looked looked weak he hung
[37:43] out with the wrong kind of people and it
[37:45] was because of
[37:47] prejudice so in Galatians chapter 6:3 it
[37:51] says for if a man think himself to be
[37:53] something when he's
[37:54] nothing he deceives himself
[37:58] it could be said of the priest and the
[38:00] levite as they came across this man who
[38:02] was beaten and left half
[38:06] dead that they would have looked down on
[38:09] him and in their own
[38:13] self-conceit they would have thought oh
[38:15] well I I I'm busy I I've got to go to
[38:17] this appointment and I have thing better
[38:19] things to do with my time or I I can't I
[38:22] can't risk uh coming up against a dead
[38:24] person or I I they're more worried about
[38:26] these other things
[38:28] a man who thinks to himself their own
[38:30] because of what they thought of
[38:32] themselves it hindered their sympathy
[38:35] for somebody else going through
[38:37] something and I say sympathy because
[38:40] they probably had uh they had right to
[38:43] be empathetic but because they had so
[38:45] separated themselves from other people
[38:48] they wouldn't claim to understand what
[38:50] another person was going through who
[38:52] wasn't like them they would be as dogs
[38:55] they would not be worthy of the same
[38:57] things and they would not be worthy of
[38:58] accord or or to be loved as themselves
[39:01] so they would have looked at them and it
[39:02] would have even hindered their sympathy
[39:04] and because they could not sympathize
[39:06] they weren't willing to stop and
[39:08] help but a man who thinks himself to be
[39:13] something when he's nothing has deceived
[39:16] himself this is the attitude of the
[39:19] Pharisees the stage player The Pretender
[39:22] who is so invested in the role that they
[39:26] never leave it
[39:28] that they're uh this they've taken on
[39:30] this Persona and it becomes who they
[39:34] are brother bman the sermon investment
[39:37] says Nicodemus one day admitted the
[39:39] truth you know he came by night to make
[39:41] an investment he found the bake was a
[39:43] bank was open he come
[39:47] uh it's always open he thought well the
[39:51] bank is doing business all through the
[39:52] day for this investment but I believe
[39:54] I'll go by the night and he found it
[39:56] open ready
[39:57] he said Rabbi we know that thou are a
[39:59] man sent from God no man can do these
[40:01] things like you're doing except God be
[40:03] with him it's totally impossible see he
[40:05] admitted there to the whole
[40:07] denominational world that they knew it
[40:09] was
[40:10] so are you
[40:12] listening but for prejudice for
[40:15] prejudice and pride and social
[40:19] popularity of the day just like that
[40:22] rich kid
[40:23] did just like the Rich Young Ruler
[40:27] why did he reject Christ
[40:30] Prejudice he might have thought man I
[40:32] run with some of the wealthiest
[40:34] people I have the best social scene and
[40:38] it'd be one thing if you wanted me to
[40:39] sell everything I have and just store it
[40:41] up and kind of go on this journey so I
[40:43] could just be this kind of Bohemian and
[40:45] I could just tell my friends hey man I'm
[40:46] just following the teacher for a while
[40:47] I'll be back look after my goods but
[40:49] it's like I don't want to be identified
[40:51] with you I don't want to take up my
[40:53] cross and he's maybe looking at the folk
[40:56] he'd hang out with and he's like
[40:58] I don't know this isn't how I want to
[41:00] live this isn't how I want to be
[41:01] perceived but for prejudice Pride social
[41:04] popularity just like the Rich Young
[41:06] Ruler he said just like the rich kid did
[41:08] for Prestige and social understandings
[41:11] they didn't want to give up the
[41:13] world why didn't the Rich Young Ruler
[41:16] want to give up the world
[41:18] Prejudice he had already made up his
[41:20] mind perhaps he'd already had some sort
[41:22] of bias maybe himself and at the risk of
[41:25] offending some that he had kept the law
[41:27] from his youth but he was a religious
[41:28] hypocrite he was a
[41:31] bigot because it was all for show it
[41:33] wasn't sincere and genuine that given an
[41:35] opportunity to do something Beyond
[41:37] himself do something to show that he was
[41:38] willing to put some skin in the game
[41:40] that it wasn't all for himself that he
[41:42] wasn't a narcissist he wasn't selfish he
[41:44] wasn't self-serving and self- protecting
[41:46] that he could take some risk and trust
[41:48] God not his wealth it's like ah I don't
[41:51] want to take that
[41:54] chance Prejudice and pride
[41:57] is at the heart of the Rich Young Ruler
[41:59] it was at the heart of
[42:01] Devas it was the reason why day after
[42:04] day he could pass by Lazarus and never
[42:07] offer help because he did literally and
[42:09] figuratively look down on
[42:13] him brother Michael shared a quote with
[42:16] a group of uh young guys he shared this
[42:19] statement it's so powerful imagine you
[42:21] might have used it in your family
[42:22] devotion he said other leaders that he
[42:23] had in his youthful days talking about
[42:25] the Rich Young Ruler had such an
[42:27] influence on him till he refused to
[42:29] accept God's provided way which was
[42:32] Jesus
[42:33] Christ the other leaders that he had in
[42:36] his
[42:36] youth they had so swn into him ideas and
[42:40] opinions and leanings and
[42:43] biases a and the and these
[42:46] prejudices where he had become
[42:50] sanctimonious he was making a show of
[42:52] being
[42:54] righteous and because of prejudice and
[42:56] pride and soal popularity social
[42:58] understanding Prestige his other leaders
[43:01] had so such an influence on him he was
[43:04] already predisposed he was already had a
[43:07] bias he was already leaning he had a
[43:09] tendency in mind he had to undo
[43:11] Prejudice towards the things of God very
[43:13] subtle even as Francis Bacon would say
[43:15] maybe
[43:17] imperceptible the things that affected
[43:19] in his understanding and kept him from
[43:23] receiving the truth
[43:31] for if a man thinketh himself to be
[43:43] something I actually um inadvertently
[43:46] maybe cut out some of my notes but I
[43:48] think we'll be okay if a man thinks
[43:51] himself to be
[43:52] something he says this after verse one
[43:56] Galatians chapter 6
[43:58] vers1 Brethren if a man be overtaken in
[44:01] a fault ye which are
[44:03] spiritual restore such a one in the
[44:05] spirit of
[44:06] meekness considering thyself lest thou
[44:09] also be
[44:10] tempted to me it's remarkable only the
[44:13] spiritual can really help somebody who's
[44:15] wounded or hurt or made a mistake or
[44:18] overtaken in a fault he speaks to the
[44:20] spiritual why to the spiritual because
[44:22] they're the ones that would have the
[44:23] power the capacity and the wisdom to be
[44:25] genuine to be authentic and w to help
[44:27] somebody else and not go help the guy on
[44:29] the ground who's struggling who just
[44:31] fell down so you could pickpocket
[44:34] him right you notice they dropped
[44:36] something and you're like oh let me help
[44:37] you and you put your foot over the $100
[44:39] bill that they dropped right and you're
[44:41] helping them pick everything up and
[44:42] you're never moving your other foot
[44:44] right because you you you're
[44:48] selfish so he's saying you which are
[44:50] spiritual and he says do it in a spirit
[44:52] of meekness why because meekness is not
[44:53] weakness meekness is power under control
[44:56] you recognize that one caught in a fault
[44:58] is vulnerable you realize that you could
[45:00] take advantage of them that you could
[45:02] maybe manipulate the situation oh man he
[45:04] made a mistake this is my chance this is
[45:07] my opportunity I can I can strike now
[45:10] I've caught him in something and he's
[45:11] made a mistake and he's done something
[45:13] wrong and you look for an opportunity to
[45:15] gain some power even maybe take some
[45:18] opportunity and you use it to your
[45:21] advantage I've seen this happen even in
[45:23] Ministry where when one looks to have
[45:26] made a mistake or there's some question
[45:28] or there's something going on that they
[45:30] that are who Who present themselves a
[45:32] spiritual seed as an opportunity to
[45:33] advance
[45:36] themselves instead of saying hey how
[45:39] could we
[45:40] help in a spirit of meekness and then
[45:43] this is to me the part that just really
[45:45] sums it up all he has to say is consider
[45:48] yourself lest thou also be
[45:51] tempted there there ought to be a
[45:53] meekness which is kind of combined with
[45:55] some humility that the spirit spiritual
[45:57] have the capacity to check themselves
[46:00] and when they see somebody overtaken a
[46:01] fault we might be inclined to Pearl
[46:03] clutch or just be oh my goodness I can't
[46:04] believe they do that they call
[46:06] themselves a message believer but there
[46:07] ought to be some mechanism inside that
[46:09] stops and says wait a minute
[46:12] man that that could have been me or I
[46:15] wonder what they're going through you
[46:18] know it's next time somebody does
[46:19] something that seems a little bit
[46:21] unhinged instead of saying oh my
[46:23] goodness this is the real them
[46:27] I never thought this just goes to show
[46:29] stop for a moment and just assume that
[46:31] you knew the real them and that this is
[46:34] out of character and ask yourself what
[46:36] must they be going through to act this
[46:39] much out of
[46:41] character change your attitude like man
[46:44] they must be going through it this isn't
[46:45] like them and not all of a sudden just
[46:47] be like well they finally showed their
[46:49] colors brother there's just an arrogant
[46:52] jerk just ask yourself what must I be
[46:55] going through
[46:57] see just so nice and agreeable there's
[47:00] not an arguing bone in
[47:03] him but you consider
[47:07] yourself if you're ever going to be able
[47:09] to help someone you can't be
[47:12] prejudicial you can't have this bias you
[47:14] can't be a
[47:16] bigot our judgment has to be right or if
[47:18] anything we have to reserve
[47:20] judgment he says considering your own
[47:22] self in other words you have some sort
[47:25] of self-awareness
[47:27] your own
[47:28] Humanity that by the grace of God I am
[47:31] what I am and I'm not what I used to be
[47:33] and I won't remain What I Am by God's
[47:35] grace I'll continue to grow and so
[47:37] there's some awareness of your own
[47:38] weakness there's even some even though
[47:40] we ask God to keep us from remembering
[47:42] and we don't not want to remember our
[47:43] past sins but sometimes we just need to
[47:45] remember I don't remember everything I
[47:47] did but I did some
[47:48] stuff haven't always been this perfect
[47:51] or this close to perfect I've had some
[47:53] of my own past failures so in humility
[47:56] and in this uh you know a low opinion of
[47:58] yourself it has to be that way if we
[48:00] want to put it that way or just a a
[48:01] modest view of your own importance you
[48:03] can see your own biases you can overcome
[48:07] Prejudice and that knee-jerk reaction
[48:09] sometimes to be a bigot and say no I'm
[48:10] not going to go
[48:12] there I'm going look at this situation a
[48:14] little bit better so he says a man who
[48:16] thinks himself to be something when he's
[48:19] not those are the ones that look at
[48:21] somebody in a fault and judge them and
[48:23] look down on them and they've lost the
[48:25] capacity to help them
[48:27] and I'm using this in the context of our
[48:29] home
[48:31] life and just how easy it is whether it
[48:34] be the Young's attitude towards towards
[48:36] the old I think it's easy sometimes for
[48:38] young people to begin to have contempt
[48:40] for their
[48:41] parents because maybe there's a time
[48:43] when they thought they knew everything
[48:44] they were the best Christians in the
[48:46] world and as they get a little bit older
[48:47] and they get a little bit wiser and they
[48:48] become you know 16 14 13 just throwing
[48:51] things out there they begin to realize
[48:54] whoa I don't know if that's exactly the
[48:56] right way to respond
[48:58] dad right and they're a little bit more
[49:01] wise to things and they're a little bit
[49:02] more sensitive to inappropriate
[49:04] responses and and they're wanting to
[49:06] understand the why behind some things
[49:07] and so it might be easy for them to say
[49:09] like man they're they were always so
[49:11] strict and they were so hard on us and
[49:13] Jack just gets to do whatever he
[49:15] wants I know you're all wondering why I
[49:17] choose Wednesday nights just to deal
[49:19] with our family
[49:22] issues I'm not doing it I'm just
[49:25] dramatizing for the sake of all the
[49:27] other families that have to deal with
[49:30] that but there's it's easy to begin to
[49:32] have contempt even as the child in a in
[49:35] a
[49:36] relationship that there begins to
[49:38] there's this resentment this contempt in
[49:39] Youth and even in teenagers and they're
[49:41] beginning to develop the wrong attitude
[49:43] maybe to Old older siblings or authority
[49:45] or their parents and it's a real
[49:47] dangerous area to be and I think it's
[49:51] even more dangerous when we as the
[49:53] adults and the parents begin to
[49:55] establish those types of resentments
[49:57] towards our own children or other people
[49:59] or Believers because of their
[50:02] faults and the real reason why it begins
[50:05] to harm us is we have not taken into
[50:08] consideration that being spiritual we
[50:10] consider ourselves and humble ourselves
[50:13] and we want to be in a position to help
[50:16] if the if there's the context of a
[50:17] relationship to do that is Paul is Paul
[50:21] is saying in the galatian letter to ye
[50:23] who are spiritual help one another and
[50:25] bear ye one another burdens and every
[50:26] man must bear his own burden and there's
[50:28] a little bit of give and take and
[50:29] there's a a huge balance that he's
[50:31] addressing but there's he's talking
[50:33] about this Prejudice or this bigotry
[50:35] that exists in our hearts where we see
[50:37] somebody who's a little bit unlike
[50:40] us and we really can't help them we can
[50:42] only look down on them or dog
[50:44] pile and the sermon the word became
[50:47] flesh and I've really got to zip through
[50:49] the rest of this
[50:50] now brother B says and I recognized the
[50:53] other day I share this because now it's
[50:55] it's you don't want all of a sudden like
[50:57] turn on the green light for everybody
[50:58] who thinks they're
[50:59] spiritual right and so after church it's
[51:01] like I'm just here to restore you I'm
[51:03] just here to restore you I'm being Meek
[51:06] right and in in the spirit of meekness
[51:08] sister I think your skirt's too tight
[51:11] right and and all of a sudden now the
[51:14] spiritual people are like I've been
[51:15] called out tonight I'm sorry brother
[51:17] Aaron I need to be more active in in
[51:20] dealing with everyone's
[51:23] faults wrong idea Diva and d.
[51:27] wrong
[51:28] idea he said I recognized the other day
[51:31] other day a selfish Spirit coming up in
[51:34] me saying this man's wrong I ought to
[51:36] tell him about
[51:37] it brother I'm just being honest I
[51:40] recognized a selfish spirit that rose up
[51:43] within me saying this man's wrong I
[51:45] ought to tell him about it now it wasn't
[51:47] the selfish spirit that caused him to
[51:49] perceive the man to be an error he was
[51:51] right based upon what I'm reading about
[51:53] the man being wrong but he was selfish
[51:55] in saying I to say something about it he
[51:58] said that's wrong God's the one to tell
[51:59] him about it it's none of my
[52:01] business it tells me that sometimes
[52:04] there's the lack of
[52:06] relationship there there's the the lack
[52:08] of agency there's something missing in
[52:11] the context to where you don't have the
[52:13] standing to say something if you say
[52:15] something you're only trying to advance
[52:16] yourself if you're say something you're
[52:18] only dog piling if you say something
[52:19] you're doing it for all the wrong
[52:21] reasons you need to pause and let God
[52:24] handle the situation he said it's n of
[52:27] my business but my business is preach
[52:28] the gospel and love
[52:31] everybody that's my business maybe I
[52:34] should put this up here preach the
[52:35] gospel and love everybody and move on
[52:38] and love my enemies as Jesus Christ
[52:41] loved me when I was his enemy I almost
[52:44] wondered if there was a man who had made
[52:45] a mistake who was very bitter towards
[52:47] brother Bram or maybe had castigated him
[52:49] publicly or done something maybe overt
[52:52] against brother brandham and this man
[52:53] makes a mistake and brother bram's kind
[52:54] of like
[52:56] you're right say well you know you're
[52:58] wrong right you shouldn't have done that
[53:00] and he says maybe he was an enemy he
[53:02] says but I got to love him that's right
[53:04] when I was unlovely he loved me to his
[53:07] bosom in anybody that's unlovely let me
[53:10] love them the same let the spirit that
[53:13] was in Christ be in us he says amen I
[53:16] love him I love him Oh my he begins to
[53:19] sing C it not this world's vain
[53:22] riches that so rapidly decay
[53:27] seek to gain the Heavenly
[53:29] [Music]
[53:31] Treasures they will never pass
[53:34] away hold to God's unchanging hand this
[53:39] is what he begins to sing as he's
[53:40] closing the service but he says I
[53:43] recognized a self selfish
[53:45] Spirit where I wanted to call somebody
[53:47] out for being
[53:49] wrong and he said that wasn't any of my
[53:52] business I need to love them I need to
[53:55] preach the gospel and he says covet not
[53:57] this world's vain
[53:59] riches seek to gain Heavenly Treasures
[54:02] he sings this and he sings that chorus
[54:05] when my journey is completed and he
[54:06] sings the chorus again he says is that
[54:08] the prayer of every man and woman boy
[54:10] boy or girl in here
[54:12] today he said God bless you and may he
[54:15] keep you that
[54:17] way humble in your spirit soft in your
[54:22] soul forgiving others as Christ for
[54:26] God's sake forgave you be kind
[54:31] generous
[54:37] welcome
[54:39] humble Spirit soft Soul
[54:44] forgiving humbl in your spirit soften in
[54:47] your soul forgiving others as Christ for
[54:49] God's sake forgive you be kind be
[54:53] generous be welcoming
[54:57] he recognized his selfish
[55:01] Spirit the the counter to that is the
[55:03] hum being humble in spirit being soft in
[55:05] our souls and forgiving others I'm going
[55:09] to power through this I'm going to
[55:10] finish in 1 John chapter 3: 17 and 18
[55:13] but who so hath this world's
[55:15] Goods I hope you can see how this fits
[55:17] in the overall
[55:18] scene who ELO have this world's good
[55:21] there's Devas there there's the the Rich
[55:23] Young Ruler there's these uh the just
[55:26] Steward here's the priest and the levite
[55:30] they have this world's goods and seeth
[55:31] his brother have need and shutteth up
[55:34] his bowels of compassion from
[55:37] him now it's not explicit to us how that
[55:42] you could open up this compassion and
[55:44] you could you could somehow render Aid
[55:47] or help in this time of need and as
[55:49] brother bam said you know live for
[55:50] others the joy you can get from that and
[55:52] how that you can maybe help he said but
[55:54] you shut up the compassion
[55:57] I believe we can do this just with our
[56:00] attitude that when we are prejudicial
[56:03] and we're biased and we make these
[56:04] assumptions and these harsh conclusions
[56:06] and we lash out or we're cold or
[56:08] whatever it might be there's somehow
[56:10] that we close ourselves up and we
[56:11] withhold kindness we withhold friendship
[56:13] or prayer we withhold love we we uh we
[56:17] our arms
[56:18] length and I say this because I think
[56:21] this is some of our it's I I say this
[56:23] personally I'll just be real transparent
[56:25] it's a protection
[56:26] mechanism that when you've been hurt man
[56:29] you just you just separate yourself you
[56:31] stand your stand office you're going to
[56:33] you're going to uh be arms
[56:36] length and so you kind of close the door
[56:38] of those Avenues of
[56:41] relationship and friendship or
[56:43] opportunity to help but then he ask how
[56:46] dwelleth the love of God in
[56:48] him see somebody who has the AA
[56:52] availability this world's Goods he has
[56:55] opport opportunity he's as we've been
[56:57] talking about the rich man and and the
[56:59] steward and even brother Bram saying
[57:02] that the rich men that it's not
[57:03] impossible to be rich but you can't have
[57:06] uh these wrong opinions and these
[57:07] prejudices and these ideas he says how
[57:10] can you see somebody who's in need and
[57:13] then shut up
[57:15] compassion he says how do you have the
[57:17] love of God in you my little children
[57:19] let us not love in word neither in
[57:21] tongue but in deed and in
[57:24] truth some of us may have grown up
[57:27] without ever hearing much about I love
[57:29] you I love you and you might not have
[57:30] heard it very much but yet maybe there
[57:32] might have been acts of Love That
[57:34] affirmed affection or someone's interest
[57:36] and desire as parents to a child but
[57:39] it's one thing to say I love you but
[57:41] it's greater to show it I think it's
[57:44] good to be verbal and to give verbal
[57:46] praise and affirmation verbally that you
[57:47] love somebody but don't just do it in
[57:49] word or tongue but indeed and in
[57:52] truth now I want to I'm going to share
[57:55] these statements to CL as a way of just
[57:59] anchoring down this down real tight as
[58:01] to why this is relevant brother says how
[58:03] can we hold
[58:05] Prejudice a racial
[58:08] Prejudice I was reading a statement I
[58:10] don't have it here but I was reading
[58:12] through it the study where brother
[58:13] brandham was talking
[58:15] about uh Kennedy being assassinated and
[58:17] they even talked about this racial
[58:19] hatred where uh a man had just been it's
[58:21] in late 63 obviously in November of 63
[58:24] and he says that even this uh man was
[58:26] just shot in racial hatred and there was
[58:30] a lot of race riots and a lot of things
[58:32] happening in the South during that time
[58:33] a lot of
[58:35] upheaval and he's saying but now our
[58:37] president's been killed and he begins to
[58:39] pray for the president's wife he says
[58:43] now I know we might have disagreed and
[58:44] she might have led this nation astray
[58:46] but he prays so sincere so heartfelt
[58:50] there wasn't this is the judgments of
[58:53] God on New Orleans for being so
[58:55] unrighteous
[58:56] right there wasn't this this is the
[58:59] judgments of God and all the homosexuals
[59:01] right there was it that's not the
[59:04] attitude that brother Ram took in this
[59:06] moment where it was like he could have
[59:08] been like yep I'm telling you she asked
[59:10] for it I I I told you this was coming he
[59:13] had such compassion he could relate to
[59:16] losing a
[59:17] spouse he prayed with empathy and he
[59:21] began to call upon God for this this
[59:23] wife of the Dead president a Jaclyn Ken
[59:26] was reading this week where she smoked
[59:28] like five packs a
[59:30] day there's a lot of mistruths about
[59:32] Obama being the first president who SP
[59:37] smoked couldn't hold the candle to
[59:39] Jackie but he says how can we hold
[59:41] Prejudice racial pre Prejudice how can
[59:44] we hold the denominational Prejudice and
[59:46] still saying we're walking in light how
[59:48] can we hold prejudice against the word
[59:50] of God and say the days of Miracles has
[59:52] passed God's Own word oh how it's a
[59:55] really Danger ous thing to be all
[59:57] closed-minded to put a period on
[59:59] everything to lean a particular way in
[1:00:01] the word of God in your own bias and
[1:00:04] your own judgment and because of the
[1:00:05] influence of people on you and your
[1:00:07] youth just got a certain way of seeing
[1:00:09] it and you're not willing to accept the
[1:00:11] word of God when it opens up when it
[1:00:12] becomes plain because you have a
[1:00:14] prejudice against the word of God and
[1:00:16] you say days of Miracles has passed I
[1:00:19] brother kyre Diggs was trying to walk
[1:00:21] that tight rope just even in his title
[1:00:24] fundamental people with Pentecost faith
[1:00:26] and you knew right away woohoo he's on
[1:00:28] the
[1:00:29] Highwire right and and you can't you
[1:00:32] can't say well we don't need fundamental
[1:00:34] faith we can't we can't be fundamental
[1:00:37] and you you don't want to do away with
[1:00:39] Pentecost being Pentecostal in the true
[1:00:40] sense of what is
[1:00:42] Pentecostal and so you could see here
[1:00:44] that sometimes if we lean some way
[1:00:46] you'll just reject it you call it
[1:00:47] Pentecostal or you lean the other way
[1:00:49] you reject it because it's fundamental
[1:00:50] it's just
[1:00:51] teaching because of your bias or your
[1:00:54] Prejudice I believe some times that's
[1:00:56] why the Lord ministers to us in the way
[1:00:57] that he does we're like man they were
[1:00:59] really hammering down a particular line
[1:01:01] on this line but maybe God's trying to
[1:01:03] address some bigotry in our own Hearts
[1:01:07] because if it's in God's word we want to
[1:01:09] embrace it if it's in God's word we we
[1:01:11] accept
[1:01:13] it but who can have this world's
[1:01:17] goods and not show compassion to someone
[1:01:20] in need he says how can the love of God
[1:01:21] be in
[1:01:22] you and he says it's Prejudice how can
[1:01:24] we even hold racial pre Prejudice when
[1:01:26] my uh my wife asked me what I was
[1:01:28] ministering on I said you Prejudice and
[1:01:30] bias and she was like are you going to
[1:01:31] talking about racial Prejudice and and I
[1:01:33] was do you want me
[1:01:38] to I think it's certainly part of
[1:01:41] it it listen message Believers are
[1:01:45] because they're raised in the message
[1:01:46] they're not above being
[1:01:49] racists it exists the the the the
[1:01:52] Prejudice and the discrimination and the
[1:01:53] attitudes that people can have
[1:01:56] it's it's it's
[1:01:58] disappointing but in 1 John 1:7 but if
[1:02:01] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:02:02] light we have Fellowship one with
[1:02:05] another no if we're not in the light we
[1:02:08] separate we divide the atheist are are
[1:02:11] being born every minute when we can
[1:02:13] divide religion and we can create so
[1:02:15] many different factions to where it's
[1:02:16] just I'm going to give up I don't even
[1:02:18] know what flavor to subscribe to anymore
[1:02:21] there's just too
[1:02:22] much the Market's become so fragment I
[1:02:25] just want to get s out of
[1:02:27] it and here it says but if we walk in
[1:02:30] the light as he is in the light that's
[1:02:31] when two people could come
[1:02:33] together that that's when the the burlap
[1:02:36] and the L the silk or whatever that's
[1:02:38] when the uh the the farmer and the the
[1:02:41] the the banker can come together why
[1:02:42] because they find common basis they find
[1:02:44] common ground when we walk in the light
[1:02:46] as he is in the light we have Fellowship
[1:02:47] one with another that's what begins to
[1:02:49] address our bias our bigotry our
[1:02:51] prejudice and he says and the blood of
[1:02:53] Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from
[1:02:56] all sin when we have respect to persons
[1:02:59] you have sin but when we walk in the
[1:03:02] light as his in the light we get rid of
[1:03:04] our prejudice we get rid of our bigotry
[1:03:06] we get rid of our attitudes and our
[1:03:08] preferences and our opinions and our
[1:03:10] preconceived notions and our judgments
[1:03:12] about certain things and then we begin
[1:03:14] to be washed of all the
[1:03:17] Prejudice and we hum we're humble in
[1:03:19] spirit soften our souls we're kind and
[1:03:22] generous even if they're our enemy even
[1:03:25] if they're wrong
[1:03:27] will will will will believe they're
[1:03:29] wrong without
[1:03:32] prejudice I'm not going to judge at this
[1:03:34] time it's too early it's too
[1:03:36] soon I'm not g to I'm not going to
[1:03:39] refuse to render Aid just on the basis
[1:03:41] that you know on its face this is
[1:03:43] something I don't agree
[1:03:47] with brother brandham prays this prayer
[1:03:49] in the sermon what do the Holy Ghost he
[1:03:51] says sanctify us Lord through thy
[1:03:53] precious word and thy blood and thy
[1:03:55] Grace we plead I hope you're listening I
[1:03:58] know I'm running into the after hour
[1:03:59] here didn't realize just how late it was
[1:04:01] getting but he says and all thanks and
[1:04:03] praise will be thine sanctify us this is
[1:04:07] not being sanctimonious this is not
[1:04:09] being a religious
[1:04:10] hypocrite if if I have any pretense
[1:04:13] outwardly and I've been playing the part
[1:04:14] out outwardly let me have it the part
[1:04:17] inwardly and he says take all Prejudice
[1:04:19] from our hearts cleanse us oh
[1:04:23] Lord I I I read the scripture in light
[1:04:26] of this if you walk in the light as he
[1:04:27] is in the light it'll cleanse us from
[1:04:29] all sin it cleanses us from Prejudice he
[1:04:32] says take all Prejudice from our hearts
[1:04:34] cleanse us oh Lord give us pure hearts
[1:04:37] and Clean Hands and clean Minds that we
[1:04:39] might come into thy Sanctuary night
[1:04:41] after night rejoicing and filled with
[1:04:43] your spirit we ask it in Jesus name and
[1:04:45] for his
[1:04:46] sake the prayer is that we would not
[1:04:48] have Prejudice in our hearts because
[1:04:49] Prejudice can hinder the moving of the
[1:04:51] spirit I do not want to have Prejudice
[1:04:52] in my heart because Prejudice causes me
[1:04:55] to have the kind of things in the way
[1:04:56] and I I can't be used of God like I
[1:04:58] should
[1:05:00] be I would like to amplify this more but
[1:05:02] I'll leave the scriptures and these
[1:05:04] statements with you and
[1:05:06] summarize try to summarize it with this
[1:05:09] lengthy quote Brothers if you could come
[1:05:11] to your instruments it'd be fine he's
[1:05:14] again talking from first John if our
[1:05:15] heart condemn us or one of the Epistles
[1:05:17] of John if our heart condemn us
[1:05:19] not but if there's something in your
[1:05:21] life that condemns you you better make
[1:05:22] that thing right
[1:05:28] the Instinct of a sanctimonious
[1:05:30] person it's almost like the seeds of
[1:05:33] sanctimony are in that conviction or
[1:05:36] that feeling that maybe somebody has
[1:05:38] something you don't or is unlike you and
[1:05:42] they may still be
[1:05:44] right and so In This Moment there's this
[1:05:47] idea you you sense May something that
[1:05:49] maybe they do have something that you
[1:05:51] need or may maybe they are right and
[1:05:54] when your heart begins to condemn you I
[1:05:55] know this might I might be getting into
[1:05:57] something at 8:40 that maybe I shouldn't
[1:05:59] but it swws that seed of now I've got to
[1:06:02] justify got to find a reason to reject
[1:06:05] them I I I can't stand this dissonance I
[1:06:08] I don't like to think these things I I
[1:06:10] don't like this idea what how I'm being
[1:06:12] challenged he says something condemns
[1:06:13] you in your heart he says just make that
[1:06:14] thing right he says I don't care what in
[1:06:16] the world he says you just can't operate
[1:06:20] right the Holy Spirit can't deal with
[1:06:22] you when you have prejudice and
[1:06:26] selfishness and all those things in you
[1:06:28] the Holy Spirit can never bless
[1:06:31] you now this is this is where the
[1:06:34] instinct is to immediately begin to find
[1:06:36] justification in your life towards like
[1:06:38] oh no uh-uh no I've been blessed I've
[1:06:41] shouted I've danced I screamed I've done
[1:06:43] this I've done that no God blesses me he
[1:06:45] says you might get some intellectual
[1:06:47] emotions some workup it's amazing how
[1:06:50] often people show the divide that the
[1:06:52] true Pentecostal faith is one thing in
[1:06:54] intellectualism as another Pentecostal
[1:06:57] faith in the sense of Pentecostalism
[1:07:00] that's not the truth that's not the word
[1:07:02] that's not the the the genuine anointing
[1:07:04] on the genuine seed that is just the
[1:07:06] quote unquote little case P
[1:07:08] Pentecostalism the penny brother bam was
[1:07:10] talking about that it is
[1:07:12] intellectualism it is formalism in a
[1:07:15] different sense they're they're the same
[1:07:19] Brothers it was presenting a little bit
[1:07:21] differently at the time but he says you
[1:07:23] might get some intellectual emotion some
[1:07:26] workup and this to me I I I'm not going
[1:07:29] to try to explain this cuz he says let
[1:07:31] me just explain something to you so you
[1:07:34] catch what he's trying to say here so
[1:07:36] profound I know you've heard this before
[1:07:38] you can't operate with prejudice and
[1:07:41] selfishness says let me explain
[1:07:43] something to you for instance when a
[1:07:44] woman gets married and she's afraid that
[1:07:46] she's not going to have a baby she won't
[1:07:48] have it no but let her go and adopt a
[1:07:50] baby then she'll have one he said now
[1:07:53] the books claim that that's nine out of
[1:07:54] 10 will do that why it sets her body in
[1:07:57] the right
[1:07:58] emotion and ask your doctor if that's
[1:08:01] not right why it puts her in the right
[1:08:04] attitude now if we just think about that
[1:08:07] he's trying to explain to us how
[1:08:09] Prejudice and
[1:08:10] selfishness keeps the Holy Spirit from
[1:08:12] blessing us and then when a woman adopts
[1:08:15] a baby how it puts her in the right
[1:08:19] attitude it's it's taking her mind off
[1:08:22] the
[1:08:23] selfishness and the prejudice the
[1:08:25] prejudgments all in other words she's
[1:08:27] chosen to live for something else that
[1:08:29] wasn't even hers they've adopted a child
[1:08:32] who's in need and now it sets are in the
[1:08:34] right attitude and it's not the attitude
[1:08:36] of necessarily being motherly it's not
[1:08:38] just the attitude of no longer fearing
[1:08:40] it's the attitude of that I filled my
[1:08:42] life up with genuine service to
[1:08:45] something needy I I'm doing something
[1:08:47] outside of myself this isn't
[1:08:48] self-serving I'm not declaring oh God
[1:08:51] bless my womb and I'm fruitful but it's
[1:08:53] the humility to even adopt the child and
[1:08:56] serve one that's not her own listen
[1:08:58] think of the example let me explain
[1:09:00] something to you said a woman it's like
[1:09:02] this a woman who can't have a baby and
[1:09:03] she's afraid she can't so she doesn't
[1:09:06] and when she gets out of the selfish
[1:09:09] mind and the Prejudice and she serves
[1:09:13] begins to serve this baby she gets in
[1:09:14] the right attitude and the Holy Spirit
[1:09:16] blesses her with the
[1:09:18] child and then he says job said the
[1:09:21] things that I feared worse has come upon
[1:09:23] me
[1:09:25] he says you want to be above
[1:09:29] everything you want to be above
[1:09:31] everything where there's no condemnation
[1:09:34] or nothing to you above the selfishness
[1:09:37] above the Prejudice you got to live like
[1:09:40] real Christians live in the presence of
[1:09:42] God live daily hourly momently say
[1:09:45] nothing do nothing go nowhere let it be
[1:09:48] Christlike everything you do all your
[1:09:51] actions God requires us absolutely
[1:09:53] abstain from all things of the world
[1:09:55] World
[1:09:57] separation I want to toot my own horn if
[1:09:59] you don't mind I woke up this morning to
[1:10:01] go a doctor's to a doctor's appointment
[1:10:03] and low and behold someone had stole our
[1:10:05] Suburban come to find out it was a tow
[1:10:07] truck
[1:10:08] driver who at the request of the HOA
[1:10:13] Association hell on arrogance I don't
[1:10:15] know what that stands for but really
[1:10:17] HOAs are something
[1:10:19] else but it was they they towed the card
[1:10:21] and it's so immediately in my mind I'm
[1:10:22] like I'm a lawyer I've dealt with this
[1:10:23] before this is going to be fun
[1:10:26] it cost me 250 bucks to get my car back
[1:10:28] they're going to pay at least that much
[1:10:29] in lawyer fees right you know you know
[1:10:31] how it
[1:10:31] works and but somehow some way I just
[1:10:35] chose to try to to to be nice and in the
[1:10:38] end I realized it's kind of just what we
[1:10:40] need to be as Christians even if we deal
[1:10:43] with the grievance even if there's
[1:10:45] something that's been wrong like you got
[1:10:46] to we've got to find a way to Humble
[1:10:48] ourselves and not be harsh and bitter
[1:10:50] and cruel and
[1:10:51] mean-spirited and God wants us to
[1:10:53] abstain from all things of the world
[1:10:55] world he says
[1:10:56] separation he said be Christlike in
[1:10:58] everything you
[1:10:59] do the world wants
[1:11:02] mixers they'll go down to the beach and
[1:11:04] bathe or have a card party in the
[1:11:05] basement Bunko in the church let me tell
[1:11:07] you God wants separators who will
[1:11:09] separate men and women from sin he says
[1:11:11] listen it condemns and there's where the
[1:11:13] sin condemns our hearts and he said if
[1:11:14] your heart condemns you deal with the
[1:11:17] sin but in the midst of this it's just
[1:11:20] it it's so amazing how he's dancing in
[1:11:23] and out of this selfishness and this
[1:11:24] prejudice he says let me show you
[1:11:26] something he's giving you the example of
[1:11:28] the woman who couldn't have a baby and
[1:11:30] was fearful and what she feared Came
[1:11:31] Upon her but then she can't get out of
[1:11:33] this mode of selfishness whatever these
[1:11:35] judgments and these biases are this
[1:11:37] Prejudice brother B refers to that
[1:11:39] somehow in adopting and living outside
[1:11:41] of herself and and hopefully she's not
[1:11:43] adopting for selfish reasons but
[1:11:44] something happens that puts her in the
[1:11:46] right attitude and he starts talking
[1:11:47] about we need to be Christlike he says
[1:11:49] let me show you something I apologize
[1:11:50] for going lengthy now so say for
[1:11:52] instance it's right now quarter till 10
[1:11:55] by my time it's a quarter till 99 by my
[1:11:57] time says what if Joseph here which I
[1:11:59] know he would not but a week from today
[1:12:01] he wasn't a Christian and he wanted to
[1:12:03] defend a friend of his so he tried to
[1:12:05] say that he was in Philadelphia at this
[1:12:07] time on Tuesday night at 8 or 10 or what
[1:12:09] the 8th or 10th or whatever it is and he
[1:12:11] goes 9th 9th of June at quarter of 10 he
[1:12:14] was in Philadelphia because he has to
[1:12:16] defend that friend in other words a
[1:12:19] budd's in trouble he needs an
[1:12:21] alibi and so Joseph not being a
[1:12:23] Christian's willing to say oh no I was
[1:12:24] in Philadelphia on June 9th at 10:00 qu
[1:12:27] till 10 and he says all right they take
[1:12:29] his word for it and he says I solemnly
[1:12:31] swear he can say that
[1:12:34] intellectually but way down in his soul
[1:12:36] he knows it's wrong so they bringed him
[1:12:38] to trial and they say Mr Bose so he's
[1:12:40] talking about Brother Joseph Bose do you
[1:12:41] solemnly swear that you were in
[1:12:42] Philadelphia at a certain place certain

[1:13:04] saw me here swear that I was a certain
[1:13:06] certain place up here in Philadelphia on
[1:13:08] that night and he's just wanting to show
[1:13:10] us something the
[1:13:13] hypocrisy the the dissonance and he says
[1:13:16] man wasn't made to tell a
[1:13:18] lie man was made to tell the
[1:13:22] truth he says if you can't throw back an
[1:13:24] old
[1:13:25] Prejudice and selfishness how do you
[1:13:28] expect God to ever answer
[1:13:31] prayer we're wanting our our home life
[1:13:33] to be blessed we want our individual
[1:13:35] lives we want to be a home to Christ we
[1:13:37] want our families to be blessed we want
[1:13:38] to see the blessings of God in our home
[1:13:40] and we want houses to be made into homes
[1:13:42] you're never going to be do it be able
[1:13:43] to do it
[1:13:44] selfishly you're never going to be able
[1:13:46] to do it with prejudice whether it be
[1:13:48] Prejudice towards one another the
[1:13:50] contempt and the Prejudice that can
[1:13:51] begin to breed in the competitiv between
[1:13:53] spouses or the the the feeling of a lack
[1:13:55] of attention or the the letting go
[1:13:57] whatever it might be that can begin to
[1:13:59] brew within a marriage and within a
[1:14:00] household attitude towards children
[1:14:02] children towards parents I'm wanting to
[1:14:03] Simply Focus the spotlight on Prejudice
[1:14:06] tonight so that we can in our individual
[1:14:08] lives say I want to act without
[1:14:10] prejudice Act without harm to my
[1:14:12] children Act without harm to my wife Act
[1:14:14] without harm to my brothers and sisters
[1:14:16] I want to withhold the wrong kind of
[1:14:19] judgment I don't want to be a respector
[1:14:21] of persons nor a disrespect of persons
[1:14:25] how can you not get rid of your
[1:14:28] Prejudice and selfishness and expect God
[1:14:31] to ever answer your prayer oh you can
[1:14:34] speak with tongues jump over the seats
[1:14:36] and shout and beat the tambourines and
[1:14:39] talk about your neighbor out there don't
[1:14:41] you expect God to ever answer prayer for
[1:14:45] you take the name of Jesus with you can
[1:14:50] speak with tongues jump over the seats
[1:14:53] and shout beat the tambourines you can
[1:14:55] have all the Optics of Pentecost you
[1:14:57] want and talk about your neighbor out
[1:15:00] there to shut up the bowels of
[1:15:02] compassion to be prejudicial to be
[1:15:04] biased to be a racist whatever you want
[1:15:06] to say to to be nasty to spew out hatred
[1:15:09] I believe we could even revisit how
[1:15:11] empathy uh is the answer to
[1:15:14] hate and some of these different things
[1:15:16] that we've addressed as I study these
[1:15:17] things I feel like man I'm just stuck in
[1:15:18] a circle in this Arena of all these
[1:15:20] different thoughts and the reason why is
[1:15:22] because these things hinder our prayers
[1:15:25] don't ever expect God to answer prayer
[1:15:30] when your heart condemns you of your
[1:15:31] Prejudice and
[1:15:33] selfishness so we just address it and I
[1:15:36] believe we should have hearts without
[1:15:38] prejudice homes without bias that
[1:15:41] doesn't mean we don't have standards it
[1:15:42] doesn't mean we don't have
[1:15:44] boundaries but we we're unselfish we're
[1:15:47] forward looking and we're Christlike and
[1:15:51] how that we view ourselves and
[1:15:53] especially how we treat others
[1:15:55] especially those we love can we just
[1:15:57] rise tonight together and pray
