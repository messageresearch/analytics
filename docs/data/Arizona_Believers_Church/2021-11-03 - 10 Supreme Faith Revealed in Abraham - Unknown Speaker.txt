TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen amen romans chapter 9 i'd like to read verses 1 to 13 and i'm continuing on the subject of supreme faith revealed in abraham and i'm wanting to uh continue on what we were ministering on on sunday and i just made a statement at the end about isaac and um it seemed like that was uh what everybody had been waiting for so i may preach the wrong thing on sunday so i'm going to pre i'm preaching tonight what i didn't get to sunday didn't think i would have time to get to and then i made just a statement at the very end as i was closing and that may have been the most impactful statement so sometimes you sit in a service for two and a half hours just to hear a sentence at the end and so we're used to that and i trusted there was no grudge that was held because maybe i struggled through that service i felt awful that you guys had a pastor appreciation because i felt like that morning there was pastor depreciation that was taking place and so tonight hopefully we can redeem ourselves redeem the subject matter and continue on that same subject but focusing very narrowly now on something and i think it'll be a blessing to you romans chapter 9 verses 1-13 i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for i i for i could wish that myself were cursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh it's a phrase that's very important to catch here i'm gonna just pick up later on in verse six but this is tremendous background i think you can recall this later he's talking about the jews the nation those after the flesh you know the blood of abraham who are israelites to whom pertain of the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises these were given to israel the children of israel the children of isaac the children of jacob whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came so he near identifying how he came according to the flesh who is over all god blessed forever amen then he says not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they not for they are not all israel which are of israel very important concept now he's delineated between all israel and those who are called according to a promise neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth for it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated lord bless you you could take your seats the lucas you can remain seated i'm just continuing on this supreme faith revealed in abraham we were reading in the bible last night as a family and it was in uh ezekiel and the where ezekiel is going to take a brick and he's going to draw a map and he's going to put these different elements together on this stone to depict the siege of jerusalem and in this translation we were reading it said god expresses this to his equal he says be sure you do write this out exactly how i tell you because all the specific details i'm sharing are important and i thought it was really remarkable how that uh then he begins to tell ezekiel to lay on his side for 300 and some 390 days and to to be laying on his side and then not turn over and then turn over and do this and all these different days in the days and the side and then what he was going to eat and what he was going to cook it over and everything all had a specific representation it all had a an intent behind it as god was having this prophet dramatize his attitude towards israel and it reminded me how that we're looking at the life of abraham and i'm being very uh i'm kind of zeroing in on certain specifics and the reason why is because the specifics in abraham's life not only tell his story but it also foreshadows our story and we see god dealing with abraham and doing certain things in abraham's life and we can zero in on a specific and see that oh this portrays this in my life or this represents a process in my own life and this is declaring to us certain aspects of our own salvation of our own election and grace and even how god deals with us as individuals than even how god deals with the church and so it makes the faith of abraham which ultimately becomes supreme it makes it relatable for us who are coming to supreme faith in this hour and we're using this statement i've been using this one over and over again though there's many that we could use in abraham's grace covenant brother brahms looking at a particular scriptural event in abraham's life and he says what is god doing he's showing to abraham this what he's going to do to abraham seed so he's doing something specific for abraham but he was also doing something to abraham that we in our day could look back and say oh what he's doing to abraham then this is he's doing it to us now in a spiritual way and so the bible is sharing these specific aspects in abraham's life because we could just be honest with ourselves the bible says it doesn't tell us everything abraham did right i mean we don't know it doesn't say it's not abraham's journal and then you know day one and day two when we're reading it and it's just this huge volume of a man that lived over 100 years and had ended up having you know kids and multiple wives and uh and this big huge life covering volumes and volumes of moms it just gives us these little glimpses and and views into his life of certain incidences and so god is sharing these with us so the bible shares shares these details to give the proper context to his faith so we can see well this is where his faith is being developed and this is where his faith began and this is how his faith grew and this is his weak these are his weaknesses and this is the way that he went so we can identify a pattern we're recognizing a pattern what he's did to do it to abraham he does to abraham's seed and there's a process then that abraham goes through and we're in that same process we sunday i just want to make a few statements very quickly about on sunday's service we we're talking about how that from genesis 1 to genesis 11 is telling us a story that covers uh uh quite a long long period of time creation um even the fall of that creation and then this a new covenant is given to man and then it kind of gets to noah and then god judges the whole earth and then afterwards you have the um a quick narration until you get to genesis chapter 11 and it's laying the foundation genesis 1 to genesis 11 is laying the foundation of of election it's laying the foundation of faith and grace and salvation and these different elements and it's really providing the back story for abraham and when i say that i don't mean any i'm not trying to belittle what happens in genesis chapter one but really it's giving us context for the call of abraham and genesis chapter 11 the story of the tower of babel and the mindset of the people is showing us that god called abraham out of babylon and i don't think it was there's really some big reveal or mystery but i'm wanting to emphasize that and i emphasized babylon in great detail on sunday just to recognize the characteristics of it and how much it sounds like today the day that we're living in and when god calls abraham out of babylon the bible says he called him out of the city of ur in the land of the chaldees and i'm not going to read the scripture tonight but remember that he said god himself says abraham i called you out of er called you out of that city and he says i didn't call you to haran i called you to canaan i was calling you to this land but he calls him out of er and he and he's bringing him a certain way and that's the beginning of christianity and say well where did christianity begin it began not even when noah got off that ark it began when god called abraham out of this land of the chaldees and out of ur and out of babylon and this is such a beautiful representation of the time that we're living in that when in the climax of christianity in the climax of god call in a gentile bride in this time that we're living in now where do we get called out of babylon we have a voice calling us out of laodicea and knock at the door we have a voice calling us out of babylon these are such beautiful types for the time that we're living in now and some of the things that we emphasized on sunday is that satan's power satan the seed of satan's power is represented in the tower of babel and even satan's seat is babylon scripturally and these different things that we could look at but babylon chaldea the tower babel they're all related to this region and this area that god calls abraham out of er the land of the chaldees the plain of shinar it's all the same region that's identified with abraham and his ancestors and so by god leading abraham out of babylon he's foreshadowing what he's going to do to his seat after him and we all said amen because he called us out of babylon he's called us out of sin he's called us out of chaos in acts chapter seven verses two to four now we're just gonna we're continuing on and i feel like i'm just kind of picking up where i could have been on sunday the we've used this scripture a few times before but this is stephen now expressing this and kind of giving the history to these jews are going to soon stone him he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia and you probably the only time you'll hear this is in your you know geography class or you know history class or something in school or reading the bible this is a region which means the word means between two rivers and it's the land between the tigris river and the euphrates river and it's a specific area uh that abraham is living in when he's called out it says this is where he was he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in koran so this is uh the city of ur and then it's before he dwelt in quran because he kind of travels and stays in the same region when he goes to quran he says and he said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall show thee then he came out of the land of the chaldeans and dwelt in korean and from fence when his father was dead he removed him into this land canaan palestine or israel wherein you now dwell and so this region that god is identifying that all israel would know this is where abraham came out of it was in the re it was the plane of shinar that he called him out of it was where the babel tower was built it's where the babylonian kingdom began it's where all these images and all these powers and these things that we represent with satan's agenda that's where it was initiated and that's where abraham was brother bannon made this statement not only was ancestor worship originated in babylon but also the worship of nature originated in babylon it was in babylon the gods were identified with the sun and the moon and there's a statement he makes in the church age book and quran was the home of the mesopotamian moon god you want to know what his name was sin not interesting the moon god was s-i-n it's it's this this would be the the mesopotamian name or the the the dialect that they gave it but to us if we read it it would be s-i-n-sin but it was the home of the moon god and we know that the moon represents in type there's a way that it can be typed as the church but then there's this representation there's a place where the church begins to have preeminence and what is it it's mystery babylon and the church enforces its own agenda and it goes out to conquer and to destroy and and to murder and to kill anyone who disagrees with him so when we see the moon god and we see the moon being worshiped that's not not reflective of the true church but rather it's reflected of the false church or mystery babylon and now as we think about this this is where god god says i called you out of mesopotamia he's there in ur in the city of the chaldees the bible says he goes to karem there were two main seats of worship of the moon god in mesopotamia you want to guess where they were the chief one was in ur and the other one anybody want to guess what the second one was quran place that abraham moved to or quran as it says in acts chapter 7. and so the two main seats of worship was er in the south of mesopotamia and then haran where abraham moved the first time in the north the chief sanctuary at ur was named the house of the great light the sanctuary in the city of haran was named the house of joys just think of the perversion that's mixed up into it think about even how the god describes himself he's descriptive of light and how that the house of joy and these different elements that we would associate with god or christianity or the fruits of the spirit are being embodied within a false worship and represented in beautiful temples and these great sanctuaries and orders of worship but this is what god is calling abraham out of a false image of false worship that may be very very close to the truth even something that could seems to be reflecting the light of the sun but yet loses its place and becomes perverted and these principles are still true today i don't care how how long it's been since you've been a catholic or how long it's been since you've said master how long it's been since you genuflected when you walked across the aisle just passing through a church or or did this you know before you went up to bat whatever it might be there there's still spirits and elements that plague us today to try to make a false image out of church and worship the church and so this moon god cult spread throughout all the regions so that temples are found temples to this moon god are found and all were found in all the large cities in babylon and then brother branham emphasizes this in the churches book and history bears it out and shows it that the mystery babylon and the lies of babylon spread out through all forms of worship in the world today at the core of it is satan's agenda and his i will i will and and it might seem to be christian based or it might seem to be um based upon abraham even with islam and there might be different ways that it seems to be true or it might have something oh it's just kind of a a best way of thinking or with a hinduism or this way a different way and just having peace with with nature and everything and uh it just reminds me of the joke that someone told about what the the hindu or i can't remember who it was that asked for a pizza and how did he wanted to be one he wanted one to be one with everything or something like that but these things have their roots in babylon these they have their roots in demonic worship and so this spreads throughout all the earth now this is identifying what abraham came out of what he was called out of so in genesis chapter 24 verses 1 to 10 it says that abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things so we're coming to the end of the story of abraham and there's a lot that's covered in here because we realize just a couple chapters before abraham is offering up his son isaac upon an altar his mount mariah experience and it says and abraham sit under his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh so this is a way of make swearing and kind of like uh you know you you shake my hand on it this is a way of uh making him swear like an oath i put your hand on the bible and and take this oath i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell this is just another principle of of the promise and who it pertained to but thou shalt go unto my country into my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac and notice what he's wanting him to do he's wanting to go back where abraham came from to get a wife for isaac and the servant said unto him pre-adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again into the land from whence thou camest and abraham said to him beware that thou bring not my son feather again now notice how adamant that abraham is that my son is not to go there but you're to get his wife out of there the lord god of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from fence from this place that i'm sending you and the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again notice just how important this is to recognize that there's now there's now being a distinction made to where the promise is and where it takes place and how that though abraham was called out of that and there's still yet a work to be done there he will not go there to identify it vindicate it be caught there i didn't uh or to be associated with it there has to be a calling out of it for it to take place my son's not going to go back there he's not going to enter back into babylon he's not going to enter into that chaos he's not going to enter into that region he's not going to go back i'm not going to risk my son going back into babylon but you go and you get him a wife out of there and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter and the servant took ten camels of his camel ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hands and he arose and went to mesopotamia under the city of nehor which is which would be haran that was the city that nehor dwelt so where is he going right back to he's going right back to babylon going right back to the place that abraham was called out of and this is a beautiful type that we're seeing here because it's in the land that god called abraham out of that the servant finds rebecca the very place that abraham is called out of babylon the very place the city of her in the land of the chaldees and the plains of shinar in the place of the tower of babel in the koran one of these chief sites for the worship of the moon god that is where abraham servant finds rebecca who is the wife of abraham's son isaac this is the one that god spoke of i'm going to give you a son and he's going to have it he's going you're going to have a son his name's going to be isaac he's going to be from sarah now he needs to be married and god's going to go right back to the same place send in a servant abraham send a servant right back to the same place to call the bride out of there for isaac now what does this portray and signify to us in galatians chapter 3 verse 16 now to abraham and to his seed were the promises made now this this reference to the promises to me is very uh stood out to me as i was going through these scriptures today the promises were made to abraham and his seed he saith not unto the seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so when we're reading in the and and genesis chapter 12 13 14 15 16 17 and on and on and on in any time he speaks about thy seed and so shall thy seed be we might think oh isaac and we think oh we think jacob and we start thinking about the natural cedar all the seeds like we are royal seed of abraham but he's saying that this promise the promises made to abraham and his seed and paul is saying but this is as of one and it's paul's words that say to thy seed which is christ so though we see a seed come forth from abraham that is identified as the one to whom the promise is going to ultimately come through the seat of abraham is christ so when god calls a bride for isaac he's laid a pattern for the choosing of his own bride this is why it's so important the way that god allowed this to take place this is why the specifics are the way that they are because today we see god calling a bride out of laodicea he's calling a bride out of lao to see it because when you read the church age book there's not one compliment for laodicea not one compliment for laodicea so god is calling a bride out of laodicea what is he calling a bride of out of babylon what is he calling the bride of out of the church he's conor out of the church he makes this statement he's here today taking a bride out of the gentiles for his namesake so it's a bride coming out of the gentiles that was already patterned in the colon of abraham because abraham was called from among all the gentiles gentiles would even just mean people just humanity because at one time before abraham was given the sign of circumcision and then had seed after him that also received the sign of circumcision and they became known as israelites because that's the name that jacob's name was changed into who was the grandson of abraham you following me that's how you get jews so everyone was gentiles when god called one man out of the mass of humanity abraham and elected him so abraham was called out from among the nations which is a type of god calling one woman out of the nations again out of the gentiles and he says god called abraham out of babylon so then god calls his son isaac he calls a bride for his son isaac out of babylon which is a type now you follow just how i know it's very very simple and sometimes we like the amen the things we don't quite understand uh it but if in this i know it's very very simple but catch that god did that not only for isaac because he there was a very purpose a purpose and intent behind getting the bride from his family and there's many things represented in it for abraham and isaac but what does it also do it laid the pattern for what he's fulfilled in this hour so it says in genesis chapter 25 verse 20 kind of giving using a scripture just to show that it was brought to pass and isaac was 40 years old when he took rebecca to wife the daughter of bethel the son of the syrian the pat anaram the sister to laban the syrian and this area of syria uh padangnaram which is this is more the region but the city he's from just south of it a little bit i think geographically they say was haren the place where they would have been just south of iran this is the whole area they're referring to so this is the this is what's being identified over and over again uh that rebecca is identified with that abraham is identified with that he's called out of so it's god's pattern of choosing a bride he calls isaac bry isaac's bride out of babylon out of mesopotamia what is it out of confusion the seed of satan the chaos and everything and brother branham says in one place now it's being revealed by the son of god as he comes to call a bride out of that system you begin to recognize it over and over and over again when we see a bride being called out in this hour it's out of chaos out of darkness out of confusion out of systems out of man-made creeds and dogmas and it fits perfect even to the point we say it's godless worship it's the worship of satan they think they're worshiping god but they're worshiping satan why because christ has left that left it right he's already called he's already called out of it abraham's not in there anymore the father's not in there anymore isaac's not in there anymore in order to worship god you've got to come out of it this is the pattern that's being laid in the colon of abraham this is the pattern that's laid out in the supreme faith revealed in abraham calling a bride out of the system makes the statement in the rapture and those of you um who are familiar with the message and as i often do i encourage you to listen to it uh brother wes nygard was kind enough to to provide me with a number of uh micro sd cards to share with you as a church to where all of us will have the message at our disposal on mp3 every single one of us and i'm just trying to find the the best way to hand it out which probably would have just to bring them and hand them out and i apologize if i make it more complicated than it should be but i think it's something that's very precious and a very precious gift that's been extended to us where we can all have the message and i think we should be listening to it and those of you who listen to it will recognize dozens of statements that would be connected into this but in the rapture message he's speaking of jesus he was the word in his day you've seen god reflect god has promised to send us that again in the last days so he's saying that god did something then we see the reflection or the pattern a process god does it again he says he's going to send it to us again in the last days to bring the bride out of that ecclesiastical mess in the only way it can be done so there's a bride in an ecclesiastical mess there's a bride caught up in a lot of man's creeds and ideas and doctrines in the tower of babel in babylon and mystery babylon however you want to recall it organization denomination creeds dogmas politics you name it the bride is caught up in that mess and there's only one way that god could call him out and it's the way that he's done it before and the mess is the voice of the sign he said just like he's doing now going to bring a bride out of a church leaving the remnant of the woman's seed the elected will be brought out of the church the church naturals stay here through the tribulation are you catching this how he's putting this the church natural will stay here through the tribulation the elected sometime is called the chosen the elected the remnant let's watch how he did it then because he never changes his way of doing things god has one way of doing things that's the way he does it and that's the right way always so the one way is the right way so even it may be different it's still right so the one way is the right way but he has one way of doing thing that's the way he does it and that's the right way always so see how he did it in the manner he did it in and then we can get a glimpse of this he's using scriptural examples and recognizing a pattern of god in the life of abraham he's recognized in a pattern of god to the seed of abraham and he said do you not can you recognize the same things happening today to the royal seed of abraham and he's saying that cry he's going to bring a bride out of the church why couldn't he just come into the church and marry her why couldn't he just come into laodicea and reveal himself to everyone why couldn't he just do that no that's not the pattern that had been laid out he says isaac don't you step foot back into babylon but you send a messenger with the voice come out of her and into a wedding come out of her and into a marriage come out of her into a union with jesus christ and when we look into the scripture we find that christ is on the outside of the church he's on the outside he won't return into it but he calls the bride out of it and he reveals himself in her and and if you look if you look at the story of isaac as there's boy i better not get get caught up in this with a pool as hard as it is tonight you guys are really pulling strong when i say hard in a good way right that's just how confusing our language can be man your pool is sick tonight loving it uh there's that isaac the servant goes out to get rebecca beautiful beautiful story he's gonna take rebecca from her father bethel from labe and her brother leave him with the gifts and she's gonna come out of her own choosing and he's carrying her and all he begins to just tell her about this one about this one and then she sees a man walking and coming to her he's in the field at the evening time they've left babylon they've left and he's out in his field and she's and she has is told by the messenger that's your bridegroom that's your isaac and as the bible says as soon as she heard that she left off her camel and she ran to meet her her husband and it says and isaac took her into his mother's tent and was comforted at the passing of his mother and that's where the union took place not in babylon this wasn't a babylonian wedding it wasn't a laodicean wife that he's taking to be it's something he took out of because it's of his choosing it's of of this uh this special union and they that's the pattern that god lays down christ on the outside of the church and he comes and he's coming in to step right into the bride it's a union that takes for the right it's in a special place brings her into that tit where the union takes place it's something it's something separated out of babylon this is a pattern that he's he's wanting to show because jesus the christ of the flesh that we'll come to here in a moment in romans 9 that paul said he won't set foot on earth again in the flesh until the millennium and brother branham warned us one time he spoke of the third coming when he comes with his bride he said that's the coming most people are looking for in other words they've associated all these different promises with the third coming so they're thinking that the second coming is going to be the way the third coming is going to be and they miss it so in genesis chapter 21 verse 12 we're just kind of continuing on here uh but these things are all kind of building together it says and god said unto abraham let it i guess i realize for me this makes perfect sense but i'm going to back up and give you some context genesis chapter 21 you still have ishmael that is a teenager he's growing up he's a young man that even we recognize abraham when he was told that isaac would be the seed he's like oh lord let ishmael live before thee and that remarkable when you see the prophet wanting hoping that it could be ishmael but it wasn't ishmael it was isaac and so god is addressing this in this statement he says let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad ishmael and because of thy bondwoman hagar in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken under her voice so go don't let this be grievous to you do what she says for in isaac shall thy seed be called this is these are god's words in isaac notice it's still singular in isaac shall thy seed be called it won't be through ishmael but it's going to be through this line through isaac that these seed which paul said was pertained to one christ if the messiah won't come through the ishmael line it won't come through the hagar line it won't come won't come through this uh this use of a bondwoman that produces a wild child which produces its false false twin a false organization a false idea it's got to come through isaac it'll be through that line that the messiah is going to be birthed forth and so god now this is god showing us he's choosing between abraham's sons because it wasn't just that abraham was married and had one son i mean he there was some these instances that take place in his life to where now you have an ishmael and when god now distinguishes with isaac from ishmael what you have represented is the difference you have in ishmael the portrayal of the natural church that can say well we're of our father abraham but it doesn't come the right way doesn't come according to the promise so you see embodied in this son of abraham ishmael the natural church and i'm not talking about islam i'm talking about the christian church the natural christian church it even represents the protestants and the catholics this natural church that is not of the promise that is not in union with christ that is not the elect and so god now is dividing between church natural and church spiritual when he says in isaac shall thy seed be called so in romans chapter 9 when paul is saying oh i just have this heaviness in my heart you that are after the flesh you are israelites you are my brother and this is the you guys are the ones that the promise was made to and this is who christ came to concerning the flesh it says in verse 6 romans 9 verse 6 not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are not all israel which are of israel and it's it's he he's going to amplify it but in other words it's expressing this sentiment that the promises were to israel but not everyone who claims to be israel does the promise pertain to or is the true israel that these things pertain to so he says neither because they are of the seed of abraham to make his point neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all they are are are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called repeating this the verse the words of god it's in isaac that thy seed shall be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god if it's just the natural if it's just the natural energy the natural things the carnal things the all the things that pertain to the flesh the selfish ambition the pride of men the traditions all the creeds all the dogmas if it's just the man then that's not the church he says but the children or the true church but the children of the promise notice that children of the promise are counted for the seed it creates this special elect group within the lineage of abraham you have abraham then you have his son isaac and then it's going to be coming through the loins of isaac that we have the distinction and the narrowing down of who the promise pertains to who does the promise pertain to the children of the promise they are the seed that are spoken of and this is the word of promise i just love this part thinking about it at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son when it's his promise he's the one that brings it to pass it's so beautiful that uh i'm so glad that god is not ikea right you go pick it up it's up if it's in stock but then you're gonna have to put it together yourself i'm so grateful that if he gives us a gift if he gives us something if we just yield enough he puts it all together for us his use it's his plan his program and so he says i will come and sarah shall have a son and then he says and not only this so the thought continues the promise continues this delineation of abraham isaac and israel now is going to come into view because he says not only this this is part of the word of promise but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac now this is where it really gets interesting because you have abraham in two wombs right so you have hagar the bondwoman and you have sarah his wife and god says not hagar's out of the picture it's abraham and sarah and so you kind of separated that one oh okay this makes sense but then you have isaac and rebecca and you have one womb and now this is showing the election as it comes he says for the children being not yet born either having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works a bit of him that calleth so he could say and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by a father isaac it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger god's choosing god's election as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated so this is now isaac's son jacob is the elected heir of the promise the promise doesn't follow esau it's by election it's by god's choosing it follows it follows jacob and so in this we see this is god's election this is god's pattern we see this process we see him narrowing it down so you have you have abraham and sarah that come out of babylon and then he has a son isaac now isaac needs to be married so he sends he sends his servant back into babylon to get a wife for isaac and then now notice notice what isaac does for jacob this is the elect one in genesis chapter 28 verses one to five and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan sound familiar arise go to padangaram go right back to mesopotamia to the house of bethel thy father's house and take thee a wife from fence of the daughters of laban thy mother's brother and god almighty bless thee in and make thee fruitful and multiply that thou mayest be a multitude of people and give thee the blessing of abraham to see and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land whereas thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram under laban the son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebecca jacob and esau's mother goes right back to the same place and it's there that he finds rachel and leah and it's from those women come the the tribes of israel the sons of israel this is what makes up the jewish nation this is the seed of abraham this is the great name and the great nation that was promised to abraham so when jacob is going to have a wife where does he go to find the wife right back to the same place that rebecca was called out of now just in a very we're doing really great on time so i feel like i just need to bring all everything i just need to come up here with the red volumes remember back in the day when a preacher would jump you judge how long the service was going to be by how many red volumes he brought oh no that's volume 18 that's got like that's like spoken words the original seed in there and who's the smoke and you got all nervous because you thought we're going to be here forever but i should just start bringing my red volumes because there's so much hair if you think about it so remarkable here god's telling isaac is telling jacob go into back into babylon pat anaram go back to the house of laban to get a wife so he now recognizes the attitude of his father don't marry here esau overhears this and recognizes don't marry a woman in canaan but guess where he goes to find a wife from the daughters of ishmael doesn't have the revelation oh oh well we shouldn't marry from here but he still doesn't he can't join himself to the promise so he even makes it worse and it identifies himself in goals to find daughters of ishmael to marry because the promise is by election and now jacob is going to go and find a wife rachel and leah he finds these wives you're going to bring forth these sons of the promised children of the promise that makes the nation of israel and they become a multitude of people this is god's the image that god is portraying in these sons of abraham god is reinforcing the pattern that when i call a wife when i call a bride when i call a son when i call a child of god out i'm calling him out of babylon you may have been born in the message but you still have to be called out of chaos called out of sin there's there's no there may be a privilege and a blessing but there's no royalty and having message parents there's no royalty and being born and raised in the message church the royalty comes from a new birth experience which is to be baptized with the holy ghost and every son of daughter of god must have that experience of being called out of babylon called out of sin and for some of us i i want to be very careful in how i say this but for some of us our greatest barrier to coming to the truth is how we were raised in the message because a false image of a union between an ishmael and an esau presented a wrong message of abraham to us and it became the biggest hindrance to us falling in love with christ god is showing this i'll find my seat and i'll call them out i'm gonna my if i could just kind of back up a little bit because what i want to express again is that god calls his wife he calls her out of babylon abraham took a wife out of there he went got a wife for isaac now jacob these are the ones that stand as the most prominent as the wives of the forefathers all the ones that are buried in hebron all these ones are buried together in hebrew abraham and sarah isaac and rebecca and then jacob with his two wives they're all buried in the same place why because it was expressing something to us right it's telling us something but he's also showing another side to the promise this is just very short thought i realized i daresome to say it but we might be short tonight we might do it i don't know what time i got up here but it's only 803 i mean we're doing great on time salad to go it's gonna still be open you got some time to hang out by the fire i mean this our church has got an awesome foyer and patio people talk about how many how how much does your church sit i go i don't know how much it can sit but it sleeps about 180. you know i have our own room and now that i say it you know there's a lot of churches that sleep three hundred but there's another side that he's expressing in this promise this part just blessed me so much this week when i was looking at this abraham has his wife they come out together oh my and that wonderful they came out together isaac needs a wife so god sends a messenger sends a servant now there's a lot of types there you know i'm leaving out and the messenger that goes against isaac and the type of the the how the message comes and finds us and calls this out and it finds that seed it finds that one by election think of it well how am i gonna know and he prays this prayer and he comes and who comes out to the well a daughter of bethel from the very house this is god's way of doing things and we see this but then also when it comes time when it comes time for jacob to have a wife he goes back again to the same place and what struck me is this part of the side of the promise stood out to me that god will call until the last one comes he'll have as many messages into babylon in as many weddings as he needs until the last union takes place he's never going to stop he's never going to give up there's not a seed that's left in babylon now that he's been like all right you know what this has been going on long enough let's wrap this thing up doesn't it doesn't matter if you know it doesn't matter if you left seemingly you're kind of in that wagon train and you made it out of ur into her on you found yourself in canaan like we're here and you decided to go back and you're having a really good time in babylon if you're his seed one day the message is going to find you and be like hey it's time to go get married time to leave this nonsense leave your past behind leave all this other garbage and it's time for you to come back to the truth come back to your promise and so god is going to send as many messengers as he has to into babylon just as he's done through the church ages and just as he's doing now he will send he will preach he will do it until until the last seed hears it why because this is the power of the promise it will not rest until it reaches every child of the promise we should never give up there's a song that goes i've heard it said the gospel is rest oh how i need it say it again until i believe it there's some that need to hear it over and over until all unbelief is broken away until all complexes are driven back until all scars and wounds are placed in their contacts and any wound is healed and say yes lord i relent i give into this this is this is what i was made for it's the power of the promise it will persist the promise will persist until the last one is called out of babylon i say let's not quit as a church until the last one comes out of babylon it says in acts chapter 2 we know it be baptized and this great call in verse 38 but now it says for the promise remember the promise the promise only those who are of the promise are counted for the seed and these promises were made and these promises were given and this is this is brings us into view and the promise is unto you i i want to hear some amens and to your children and and all that are far off you say oh they're way gone oh they've backslid far they're way off in false talking oh they fell way far away i'm so glad it says to them that are far off how many even as many as the lord our god shall call we can have a confidence at the same god that called you out rebecca is sitting there fretting and worrying who's going to marry jacob who's going to marry jacob don't worry just as god got you out he'll go and get another bride out for your son and we should not fret the same god that called you out we'll call your seed out we can have a bold faith we don't need to shrink back we don't need to be despondent i could maybe say this i i i say this with reverence and fear sometimes it's our response to unbelief and our response to rebellion and maybe someone seems to get a little shifty and they express some things and say some things and then we get defensive and it's in being defensive in our response it causes more damage than their own doubt and it because it actually becomes a thing that cuts the cord and pushes people away it's been the response of the church that's driven some of our children away not the church not the word not or not the truth not the message it's been the message believers that have done it why because they get scared and they get nervous and they get worried and they can't just relax and say hey i'm standing here by the grace of god god called me out of nonsense and and have this confidence not all god i'd hate to see it but if they've got to go into babylon you found me in babylon and there's no place in babylon you can't reach you'll find them and rest on the fact that we know this is the truth we don't have to fear what men can do but rest in the election rest in grace the same god that called you i will call him out but hello and brother mike if you could come and the message proven his word i was just reading different statements today that related to this the last seed coming in i want you think about it what is it if we just generalized it and summarize it tonight what happens when the last seed comes in it's over right why you ever thought about that well why why why is it all sent over we just got the last seating can we play church for a while can we have some fun with this i mean we're all believers now right it's good it's over now we know in the prophet's language there's things that may seem very literal but yet they could come to pass in a more spiritual sense but there's a wrapping up there's a summation it's done it's finished it's over we know jesus even said to himself that when the when the fruit the seed comes forth and the it's perfectly ripe then immediately the the sickle is thrust forth because the harvest is coming now once it's finished everything's ripe you harvest it why because it's god's finished he's got what he wanted this isn't what he wanted he didn't want church trust me this isn't what he wanted this isn't what he wanted right it's not steeples and beautiful baptistries that's not what he wanted he wanted a bride of his choosing and so when if it just happens with a bunch of people playing church he's like as soon as they're playing church actually a blind squirrel finds a nut and it's the last one he says i'm done because it's never been about the church it's been about his bride he says and so i was reading these statements and this one just kind of struck me very deeply he's praying at the end of proving his word dear god those may i not those may i not see because he said there's people just coming to the altar praying he says that standing they want to accept you they realize lord that this has not been done until this time some of these mad wonderful things that are being brought forth and manifested before the gentiles and now you confirm it and prove that it's so i pray father that in their hearts that's strangely moved at this time then notice he says how do we know but what this is the last person to come in this may be the end for los angeles oh wouldn't it be wonderful one day if we found the end of phoenix if the story written of maricopa valley finally reaches the point what was the point of all the mysteries unfold in a maricopa valley so we could have an awesome church right right let's just all be honest no to get a bride out of it to defeat the mysteries of babylon to defeat the defeat the mysteries of the devil that's getting lifted up and laid to see it that's the purpose he says this may be the end of for los angeles why would it be the end of los angeles it would have been it would have given up its purpose because what's the earth here for to get a bride out of it so when los angeles finally gives up the last seed he's done with her when denver gives up the last seed sorry i don't know why i looked right at you brother and i brought up colorado when it gives it the last seed it's over why because that's what it's here for he says but maybe los angeles give up the last one this may be the last soul that will be born into the kingdom we don't know when that time comes and notice this how beautifully paints the picture when it does the door will be closed why why i want to sing another special i want to have another camp i want to have another october 2022 pastor appreciation [Music] the body will be complete it will not be a freak body or a freak bride it'll just have so many members whose names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world which jesus came to take like adam walk right out to save his wife oh beautiful beautiful beautiful i'm so glad i was ending there i want to pick up sunday morning on that image the brother branham just painted this picture of how in the end time it's all over why because now he has his complete bride he says we're done goodbye world i stay no longer with you she's out of here he's come away my love he calls her out and ask her just to step right out of even the dead this sinful body that's going to be changed and we're going to go to meet him in the air why that's what it was all about to begin with the body will be complete that's why it's over when the last seed comes in because it won't be a freak body or freak bride all those members written on the lamb's book of life are now having been taken away god jesus christ coming walking right out to save his wife and takes us away what a beautiful story the story of abraham i think you can put your own name in there it's not the story of abraham it's the story of elizabeth right it's the story of brother dale it's your story where do we live in this story we're living in that time of promise and the soon going away of the church go to bower heads for a moment i'd like to pray with you [Music] it's to your seed into your seed after you to our young people here today to anyone who may feel lost anyone who feels is strangely as he says strangely moved on at this time if you'd want to accept him i invite whoever would want to accept him just to stand to your feet today if you've received him be a prayer praying in your heart for those who must receive them if you hear a voice calling you out of babylon you want to follow that voice you'd like to stand you know you could be in babylon spiritually in your parents home you could be in babylon spiritually trying to go to church and being a good person [Music] babylon is any place where your soul exists without a new birth experience you'd want to heed his voice tonight he's here speaking to hearts i'd like to open it up even if you have a need in your heart deep need healing maybe a spirit of comfort to come upon your heart you like to stand and say lord i just need a i need a healing of the of my heart [Music] i need a a re rebinding together faith muscles that once were strong have been weakened through abuse and through distress i call to us as a church if you'd like to have a renewed vision for the salvation of others and to not ridicule and mock those who are in babylon but recognize i came out of that too and lord just as you called me out of chaos and out of that system and out of that mess even if people have gone back into it i believe you're still calling and can call them out of it you want to stand saying lord make me a better representation may i be that servant that voice crying out with my life to those who are suffering and hurting make a difference make a difference our gracious heavenly father as we stand before you in your divine presence we ask [Music] with humility in our hearts that you would receive those who stood with a desire to be captured out of babylon anyone that would have the strange move upon their heart this deepness of sincerity to realize lord you're you're doing something in me i haven't felt this before this is beyond any experience and i know this is you and it's real lord i pray that you could now in a deep move of grace in a very profound and uh overt way come and move impose yourself upon that heart that is very fearful of what the future may bring very fearful of their circumstance and how much it may change the lord may there be a spirit of peace that would come upon them to say daughter all is well don't fear i've got it all in control that we maybe trust that you have the what is best for us that you will do those things which are best for us and lord we pray for those who stood wanting to for a healed heart and wounded emotions and stress stressed faith muscles whatever they may be we pray for them that you would heal them and bind them up lord as a church as we desire to be more faithful to the call to express your attributes in this end time not arrogance not more out of knowledge that puffs up but a real meekness of christ on display to call to call your bride out of laodicea and out of babylon lord may we make it our mission to see that maricopa valley serves its purpose and gives up the last bride member [Music] may may we find the end of phoenix somehow some way by your grace reach the believers that you've ordained and called may we not be afraid to pray for others and assist others who are labored in this cause lord for after all it's your bride not ours we're just members of it [Music] lord may you drive out all fear right now it has no place in our dealings with you it has no place in our pondering of the future but may we just give in to you just trust you lord may that be where it begins for those who stand here tonight and our congregation those present may we be reminded if we're accepting you may we be reminded that abraham's life began with accepting a call and he just followed your steps abraham didn't have to do it on his own neither will any of us may we just yield to you i pray have your way in jesus name amen amen praise the lord praise the lord
