[0:00] I'm going to do part two on imperfect
[0:03] Liberty we started it Sunday morning
[0:05] tonight I don't want to spend a lot of
[0:06] time backgrounding because I think it's
[0:08] important for us to go a little bit
[0:09] further in this subject matter but we're
[0:11] using this phrase Liberty from the
[0:13] scripture which means freedom or to be
[0:15] free uh it's kind of rooted in one who's
[0:18] a Freeborn citizen or one who is not um
[0:20] a servant and the Greek word means to be
[0:24] exempt from and so it has this idea of
[0:27] no longer being bound by or restrained
[0:29] by something and as we looked in the
[0:32] scripture in Timothy and also in
[0:33] Corinthians this perfect Liberty or
[0:36] Liberty as we would say scripturally is
[0:38] that freedom to become Christlike where
[0:41] you're exempt from your base human
[0:43] nature I I've Loved thinking about it
[0:45] that way in this sense that sometimes we
[0:47] feel like we have to respond a certain
[0:48] way or we just always do and this is
[0:50] what humans do and we've got a a
[0:52] thousand excuses as to why we do it but
[0:54] rather when we think about our Liberty
[0:56] in Christ it means we're exempt from our
[0:58] worst instincts
[1:00] we're we're exempt from these uh human
[1:02] uh knee-jerk reactions and reflexes to
[1:05] certain things and that's what it means
[1:06] to be free so perfect Liberty as we
[1:10] identified it on Sunday is to and this
[1:12] is you'll just find this if you look
[1:13] into the word is intended uh by Paul or
[1:16] by the writers it's to live as one ought
[1:18] to so Liberty when you have Liberty you
[1:21] can live as you ought to live you can
[1:23] live correctly you could do the things
[1:25] that are right and it's to uh to fulfill
[1:28] your duty when you're rest strained or
[1:30] when you're bound maybe there's some
[1:31] loss of privilege or right or inability
[1:33] to do something but if you have Liberty
[1:36] you can live or be act as you ought to
[1:40] and in this case of the word of God
[1:42] looking into the word of God we can
[1:44] fulfill God's desires we can meet the
[1:46] word expectation in our lives but now on
[1:49] the other hand this imperfect Liberty I
[1:51] like to put it this way it's that
[1:53] promise of Liberty um or kind of when
[1:56] someone says come in it's free a and
[1:58] then um and then you look closer just
[2:00] says free Wi-Fi and so there was this
[2:02] promise or this illusion uh of Liberty
[2:05] but in reality it's
[2:07] bondage and uh come in just listen to a
[2:11] 60-minute seminar and you're going to
[2:12] have a free
[2:14] vacation right you're like hey come on
[2:16] this is easy a trip to Mexico this is
[2:18] going to work out perfect it's
[2:19] absolutely free right you're free to go
[2:23] whenever you want too anybody ever done
[2:25] this they know exactly what I'm talking
[2:27] about surprised they haven't been
[2:28] arrested for kidnapping
[2:30] but there's this idea this appearance
[2:32] and this allurement to free and as human
[2:35] beings we love it but it's a imperfect
[2:38] Liberty because in the end what was
[2:40] promised as Liberty becomes bondage and
[2:42] so this imperfect Liberty that we're
[2:44] talking about is to actually live as one
[2:46] wants to not necessarily as they ought
[2:49] to that we have desires In the Flesh we
[2:51] have certain needs or wants that we
[2:53] might have or think that we have and so
[2:55] when we have imperfect Liberty we're
[2:57] free to do what we desire to do or what
[3:00] pleases the
[3:01] Flesh in 1 Peter chap 2: 16 and again
[3:05] this is just a part of a larger reading
[3:07] we did on Sunday as free Paul Peter is
[3:10] saying as free men not using your
[3:12] Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but
[3:15] as Servants of God you are free servants
[3:18] of God what a paradox what it seems to
[3:20] be a contradiction you are free servants
[3:22] of God Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[3:25] yet in Christian Liberty and free as
[3:28] free not using your Liberty as a cloak
[3:31] of evil wrong intent or motive so
[3:35] Liberty is not licensed to do what
[3:37] everyone wants to do in his flesh he
[3:40] feels to do a certain he can certain
[3:41] thing he can do it so Liberty is not
[3:44] licensed to do whatever we want to do in
[3:47] our flesh and it's certainly not Liberty
[3:49] to disobey God's word we cannot say that
[3:52] we are in Liberty or perfect Liberty and
[3:54] then deny the word of God reject the
[3:56] word of God add to the word of God or
[3:58] take away from the word of
[4:00] God in 2 Peter 2: 19 it says while they
[4:04] promis them Liberty it's talking about
[4:05] the false prophets and these false
[4:08] anointed ones that will go out and their
[4:10] uh attitude towards people and the their
[4:12] motive and objective he says while they
[4:14] promis them Liberty they themselves are
[4:17] the Servants of corruption notice just
[4:21] that symmetry with what he says in the
[4:22] first letter he says you are free but
[4:24] Servants of God and now they say these
[4:26] guys are promising freedom but
[4:28] themselves they're ser Servants of
[4:30] corruption for of whom a man is overcome
[4:33] of the same as he brought in bondage so
[4:35] if you're given to something if
[4:37] something takes control of you if it
[4:39] becomes on this level of soft addictions
[4:41] or real addictions you've been overcome
[4:43] by it you're not free I'm free to do
[4:45] this well if it's if it begins to
[4:47] dominate or dictate or gets its hook in
[4:50] you you've surrendered you've been
[4:51] overcome by it and that what you're
[4:53] overcome by you become a servant
[4:55] too and we read this statement just
[4:58] chopping out a little bit of it this is
[5:00] very very near where we ended uh Sunday
[5:02] morning and the anointed ones at the end
[5:04] time for the time will come when they
[5:05] will not endure sound Doctrine this is
[5:07] from Timothy where he's uh he's telling
[5:10] Timothy to um to teach and to preach and
[5:13] he's telling this right kind of attitude
[5:15] because they'll come a time when they
[5:16] will not endure sound Doctrine but after
[5:18] their own lust shall Heap for themselves
[5:20] teachers having itching ears and go
[5:23] ahead and do anything they want to so
[5:27] notice there's liberty
[5:30] and it's saying he says 'd do the work
[5:31] of an evangelist there's certain thing
[5:33] to to do and it's going to be important
[5:36] uh maybe Sunday or next Wednesday night
[5:37] when we get into some of uh some of
[5:39] these other services on Liberty and do
[5:41] the work of evangelist and just keep
[5:43] still and do it what you're called to do
[5:45] and even though maybe you could do more
[5:47] even though you feel there should be
[5:48] more do what you're called to do do this
[5:50] work and it says so they will do
[5:54] whatever they want to and this is their
[5:56] justification it's all right we got the
[5:58] same signs and wonders
[6:00] so in instead of examining themselves by
[6:03] the word they just take a part of the
[6:05] word and say well we've got signs and
[6:08] wonders and that's it Checkmate and it's
[6:11] amazing the number of people and I I'm
[6:13] not uh wanting to well I just I'll take
[6:17] a deep breath settle down a little bit
[6:19] and and say it with a
[6:21] smile we should really we should resist
[6:24] the
[6:24] temptation in having an answer resist
[6:27] the temptation when standing for what we
[6:29] believe
[6:30] to say well we've got signs and wonders
[6:32] what about you you just sound like a lot
[6:34] of cheerleaders we got Spirit yes we do
[6:36] we got Spirit how about you right it it
[6:40] it just it's
[6:41] empty because if we want to get into a
[6:44] raw raw and a pep rallet you're going to
[6:45] get beat you're going to get beat
[6:47] Elevation Worship is going to have you
[6:49] beat the Pentecostal of Alexandria going
[6:51] to have you beat right so there's this
[6:53] idea there's this principle in the word
[6:55] of God that I'm standing on faith and
[6:58] there I stand
[7:00] and so this idea that well we can do
[7:02] whatever we want to we have these signs
[7:04] and wonders following and there's this
[7:06] rejection of the truth because he says
[7:07] and shall be turned from the truth and
[7:09] be brought into fables and dogmas
[7:11] fictions lies remember Hezekiah and
[7:15] zedekiah and those H and I and those
[7:16] lies actually that we read about in the
[7:19] scripture where they've caused the
[7:20] people to believe a lie balum zedekiah H
[7:23] and I they were lying falsely saying it
[7:25] was God and encouraging certain actions
[7:28] encouraging certain things when God had
[7:29] not
[7:30] spoken and so there's their own lust
[7:33] that's so key there their own lust are
[7:35] driving them their Liberty their flesh
[7:38] says do it and Sprite says obey your
[7:40] thirst so they obey it a and this is
[7:44] that uh attitude especially of
[7:47] leoda now the scripture we've been
[7:49] looking into was that being beguiled
[7:52] from the Simplicity that is in Christ
[7:54] and that's maybe the core of everything
[7:56] I've been looking at over the last
[7:57] couple months is this Simplicity that is
[7:59] in Christ and how God hides himself in
[8:01] that Simplicity but yet that's where he
[8:03] reveals himself so that the devil can
[8:05] make us complicated God won't be there
[8:09] and in the scripture 2 Corinthians
[8:11] chapter 3:1 17 now the Lord is that
[8:13] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[8:15] there is Liberty how many have ever
[8:16] heard that quoted before where the
[8:18] spirit of the Lord there there is Li is
[8:21] there is liberty and it becomes a mantra
[8:24] or phrase or kind of this Banner of well
[8:27] the Lord had his way where the spirit of
[8:29] Lord there Liberty Liberty to do these
[8:31] certain predefined things or manifest in
[8:34] a certain way and there's a lot of
[8:36] verbiage that's used sometimes to
[8:37] express it or to uh not necessarily
[8:40] justify but just
[8:42] to um make the point that we believe the
[8:45] spirit of the Lord was there and because
[8:47] the spirit of the Lord was there there
[8:48] was Liberty to do these certain things
[8:50] that in themselves are not anti-rip so
[8:52] it's they're not trying to make this
[8:54] direct contradiction but it's this
[8:56] direct connection oh the spirit of the
[8:58] Lord was there and that's why this
[8:59] happened but when we looked into the
[9:01] scripture both in Timothy and
[9:03] Corinthians we found that where the
[9:05] perfect law of Liberty is and where the
[9:07] spirit of the Lord is there's liberty is
[9:09] speaking about beholding the revealed
[9:11] word and the revealed word doing an
[9:13] internal work that then manifest in the
[9:16] image of Christ not in uh not in church
[9:19] but in life in life and so that the
[9:23] nature of the word we're partakers of
[9:25] divine nature therefore we're living out
[9:27] the word of God so we're w to take this
[9:30] principle of Liberty and really get
[9:32] anchored in it scripturally and where we
[9:34] ended Sunday morning I believe I said
[9:35] we're addressing the LIE of Liberty that
[9:39] hides behind it is written and taken
[9:42] that in Matthew where Satan tempted
[9:45] Jesus and that uh how it parallels to
[9:48] the Temptation in the
[9:50] garden
[9:51] we're wanting to consider how the word
[9:54] of God is used to entice the believer to
[9:57] serve their own Pride own lust and their
[10:00] own
[10:01] flesh now it's not a bargain to say well
[10:05] your flesh wants it why don't you just
[10:06] have it but it's this idea that no this
[10:08] is what God really wants so this is what
[10:12] really is right and this is how that you
[10:13] should really enjoy these things it's
[10:16] this perversion of
[10:19] Liberty I think we
[10:21] use this is one way to think about it in
[10:24] leod DEA Liberty is used as a cover for
[10:28] luxury that we want to feel a certain
[10:30] way we want to enjoy certain things we
[10:32] want to have certain things and if we
[10:34] want it to be a certain way we just use
[10:36] Liberty as a code word for
[10:39] luxury we want to Lavish ourselves
[10:42] lasciviousness now I'll say this now and
[10:45] you're be glad you're here don't tell
[10:46] anybody who's not here tonight but this
[10:47] is a
[10:49] setup this whole thing and maybe if
[10:51] they're not here they're not getting set
[10:52] up but just don't tell them it's a setup
[10:53] in case they stream or I'm able to f f
[10:55] fit it in on Sunday but there's a way
[10:58] that we can live so this covers all of
[11:00] us whether it be the way that we lead
[11:01] the way that we parent the way that we
[11:03] respond to things is a way we can live
[11:05] that is legalistic or licensed and it's
[11:07] not really free we're not promoting
[11:10] Liberty in Christ we're not encouraging
[11:13] atmosphere of growth and surrender so
[11:15] there's a way that we can live
[11:17] arrogantly presumptuously carnally to
[11:19] where it's legalistic where it's binding
[11:22] to carnality or license lasciviousness
[11:25] that's this loosing of carnality and
[11:27] Liberty of the false Liberty
[11:29] and as we looked into the scripture and
[11:31] we saw
[11:32] that uh Satan tempted Christ to perform
[11:36] the supernatural with it is written that
[11:40] he was trying to make Jesus an initiator
[11:43] of something that he said well God ha
[11:45] said the word has said he was wanting to
[11:47] make him the instigator of God
[11:50] fulfilling his word well the Bible says
[11:53] and in the same way s Satan tempted The
[11:54] Woman by saying well yeah hath the Lord
[11:56] not said you shouldn't do this and so
[11:58] she answers accurate ly he says well
[12:00] it's not exactly that and put her in
[12:03] this position where she felt that she
[12:04] had to act or was encouraged to act in
[12:07] order to bring forth something or
[12:10] manifest something that was seemingly
[12:12] being withheld from her and so when
[12:14] Satan tempted Christ in in in the book
[12:17] reading in Matthew that second
[12:18] Temptation brought him to the Pinnacle
[12:20] of the temple to the house of the Lord
[12:22] and he tried to cause Jesus to what
[12:24] tempt God through some public display by
[12:27] some outward act that he would cause
[12:30] some sort of vindication and God would
[12:31] come to his Aid and say there will the
[12:33] Angels were to Bear him up and we took
[12:36] this statement from the Harvest time if
[12:38] he can't tempt you away from the word
[12:40] command these stones to be made bread
[12:42] and he said it is written man shall not
[12:43] live by bread alone but by every word of
[12:45] God and so he he said I'm a word
[12:48] believer I'll stay with the revealed
[12:50] word of God so he says if he can't kept
[12:52] you away from the word right now let
[12:54] that marinate a little if it has to be
[12:57] overnight go ahead and seal it up and
[12:58] let it Mar a little bit overnight but
[13:01] that says something if he can't tempt
[13:03] you away from the word no I'm going to
[13:06] stay with the word then he'll give you a
[13:09] supernatural
[13:10] offer I'm not I'm not rejecting the me
[13:12] I'm not a message rejector I'm not a
[13:14] word rejector I've embraced the word and
[13:16] brother man said this and the message
[13:17] says this the message says that but then
[13:19] there's this subtle adding to or taking
[13:21] away and he says so it's this it's this
[13:24] deception the spirit of deception he'll
[13:25] give you a supernatural offer he'll he
[13:28] said I tell you what you get up here and
[13:30] dive off the temple and bring back up
[13:32] show the people that you can do
[13:34] something Supernatural wow boy he got
[13:38] him there now watch this this is it
[13:41] watch when you get to the end where this
[13:44] temptation come as the serpent beguiled
[13:47] Eve in the beginning as he tried to
[13:48] tempt Christ in the middle in the end
[13:51] the body of Christ will come under
[13:53] Temptation by the
[13:55] word maybe he might let some of you
[13:57] speak in tongues and think you got it he
[14:00] might even let you prophesy though it
[14:02] not be with the word this is maybe a
[14:04] little bit of an aside I've seen people
[14:06] stand up and prophesy was contrary to
[14:07] the word as the East is from the
[14:10] West it's the word that you live by
[14:12] somebody says something in the name of
[14:14] the Lord it doesn't happen it's a li in
[14:16] spirit them Supernatural gifts Satan can
[14:18] just hand them out by the handfuls he
[14:20] says that don't mean one thing now when
[14:23] he says it doesn't mean one thing he's
[14:24] not saying they aren't Supernatural
[14:26] gifts he's not even saying that it's not
[14:28] the Lord but it's just some it's some
[14:30] means of ma God manifesting himself it's
[14:33] some way that God does something and
[14:35] works but yet that in itself cannot be
[14:38] the IND allbe that that's not what God's
[14:41] trying to arrive at they have their
[14:43] place in God's economy they have their
[14:44] place and how God deals with an
[14:46] individual in the church and he's saying
[14:48] so when he says that don't mean one
[14:49] thing saying that doesn't mean you're
[14:51] Vindicated or you're
[14:54] right so I want to use the example so I
[14:57] am going to use the example
[15:00] uh from Mark chapter 16 that applies
[15:02] spiritual it applies maybe in this
[15:04] religious way but it is just one example
[15:07] of how that we can be
[15:09] enticed and encouraged in some sort of
[15:11] license or legalism that is uh that is
[15:16] causing us to no longer to causing us to
[15:20] tempt God if I could put it that way
[15:22] just as Christ was tempted now Mark 16:
[15:26] 15 we'll read to verse 20 he said under
[15:28] this and this is the word of God go ye
[15:30] into all the world and preach the gospel
[15:32] to Every Creature I I'm wanting to look
[15:35] at this because we've already read in a
[15:37] couple places where people said we've
[15:38] got signs and wonders we've got
[15:41] Supernatural gifts you're tempted to do
[15:43] Supernatural unless we at any point take
[15:47] that to mean that we should reject signs
[15:49] or we should reject the supernatural we
[15:51] should reject laying on of hands or uh
[15:53] healings and things like that whoa tap
[15:55] the brakes he says go you into all the
[15:57] world and preach the gospel to every
[15:58] creature he that believeth believeth
[16:01] what the gospel that is preached and is
[16:03] baptized shall be saved he that
[16:04] believeth not shall be damned it doesn't
[16:07] matter if he's baptized if he doesn't
[16:08] believe it's by faith right and these
[16:10] signs shall follow them that believe
[16:12] very important in my name they shall
[16:14] they cast out Devils they shall speak
[16:16] with new tongues they shall take up
[16:17] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[16:19] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[16:21] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[16:23] recover now there's things here in
[16:26] verses 17 and 18 that we could line up
[16:29] with other places in scripture and see
[16:31] that this manifestation or this
[16:33] expression I is is is is not satanic or
[16:36] weird in the sense that God never does
[16:38] that the people never did that we could
[16:40] see where uh the casting out of devils
[16:43] is done right and and that it was and
[16:47] then even the were taught James that to
[16:49] call the Elders to lay hands and to pray
[16:51] the prayer faith and so there's other
[16:54] scriptures that give us these uh these
[16:56] marching orders and these this
[16:58] Commission of certain promises that we
[17:00] can Avail ourselves
[17:02] to if we look at this I want you to
[17:04] catch this the order of the Great
[17:07] Commission we call this the Great
[17:08] Commission there's one thing that he
[17:11] tells us to do and it's go ye into all
[17:14] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[17:17] Creature this is the must this is the
[17:21] ought in other words we can't take
[17:23] verses 17 and 18 and do that and fulfill
[17:27] the Great Commission
[17:29] what we have to do is preach Christ the
[17:31] word we have to preach the gospel the
[17:33] good news that is the first thing that
[17:36] is the must that is the ought and then
[17:38] Faith because it says and he that
[17:40] believeth faith and signs will
[17:45] follow and let me say this the signs are
[17:47] as certain as
[17:49] anything if the gospel is preached faith
[17:52] and signs will follow and the signs are
[17:54] just as certain as anything but if you
[17:56] read this in order you and if you I want
[17:59] to use it this way you go into all the
[18:01] world and preach the gospel and the
[18:03] person to whom you preach it to if they
[18:05] believe and are baptized in the name of
[18:07] Lord Jesus Christ they shall be saved so
[18:09] that's the one that believes and then it
[18:11] says these signs shall follow them that
[18:14] believe not the one that
[18:16] preached now I know you might be saying
[18:18] you learned that in law school no I
[18:21] didn't we're just reading the plain
[18:23] English you are a Believer so signs will
[18:25] follow but in the order of the Great
[18:27] Commission you preach the word CU by
[18:29] faith you're settled in it by faith you
[18:31] believe it and so preaching the word and
[18:34] exciting Faith the believer who believes
[18:37] the word has the promise that signs will
[18:40] follow them that have believed the
[18:44] gospel it's the way that this uh church
[18:47] is being established in the word of God
[18:49] being established in the beginning so
[18:51] the signs are as certain as anything to
[18:52] him who hears the word of God and
[18:53] believes but the signs are not what's
[18:56] emphasized first yeah in other words if
[18:58] you preach the gospel and in preaching
[19:01] the gospel someone heard who became a
[19:02] Believer and they became him that
[19:04] believeth that is baptized and is saved
[19:07] and then he that believeth had signs and
[19:08] wonders follow him he does his ministry
[19:11] is not signs and wonders his ministry in
[19:14] Great Commission is go into all the
[19:16] world and preach the gospel that's the
[19:18] one thing he ought to do is go into all
[19:20] the world and preach the gospel it's a
[19:21] general
[19:23] commission and if you recognize in the
[19:25] flow of the scripture what is emphasized
[19:28] first and what was done was to preach
[19:31] the gospel in verses 19 and 20 just
[19:33] spell it out so then after the Lord had
[19:34] spoken unto them he was received up in
[19:36] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[19:38] and they went forth performing signs and
[19:42] wonders watch it and they went forth and
[19:45] preached everywhere right that's what
[19:48] they were told to do so when they
[19:50] listened to what he said God said to
[19:52] preach Christ preach the word preach the
[19:54] gospel let's do that am the Lord Lord
[19:59] working with them and confirming the
[20:01] word with signs following so who did the
[20:03] rest the Lord did the Great Commission
[20:07] preached the word and the Lord would do
[20:10] the
[20:11] rest the rest the signs and wonders in
[20:14] other words are his responsibility yes
[20:16] sir on that we have to be confident
[20:20] whether you be in the Pulpit or whether
[20:21] you be in the the seat a a and you're
[20:24] teaching your children or testifying to
[20:26] family or preaching the gospel and the
[20:27] life that you live you you have to be
[20:29] confident that you're doing your part to
[20:32] live and that God's the one that does
[20:34] the
[20:35] rest because there's this impatience and
[20:38] I'm kind of letting Sunday or Wednesday
[20:39] go a little bit there's this impatience
[20:41] where you feel the need to be Vindicated
[20:44] you feel the need to know God's with you
[20:46] so you want to step beyond the bounds of
[20:47] just staying with the word of God and
[20:49] you want to see something happen so you
[20:51] can know that you're a Believer what is
[20:53] the requirement to be a genuine believer
[20:55] believe God this is the work of God what
[20:59] can we do to work the mighty works of
[21:01] God believe on him whom he have
[21:02] sent the rest is his
[21:08] responsibility now please listen very
[21:11] very closely I think we've got a a great
[21:12] audience tonight the the balcony's
[21:16] almost
[21:17] full people everywhere spread out
[21:19] everywhere just now listen signs these
[21:23] things we read here in verses 17 and
[21:25] 18 they cannot be ratified into a
[21:30] law now we can't read this and say this
[21:33] is what we have to do if this is what we
[21:37] have to do pass around the
[21:40] snakes I know we better we baptize in
[21:43] the name of Jesus Christ because the
[21:44] Bible says we have to we we this is what
[21:47] we better do but it's not written that
[21:52] way we would need to be passing out the
[21:54] Arsenic or some
[21:57] poison but it
[21:59] says preach the word and he that
[22:01] believeth the Lord will confirm with
[22:03] signs and wonders following so if you
[22:06] took these things and looked at it with
[22:08] just the slightest wrong emphasis just
[22:10] change one word it can bring you into
[22:12] bondage and cause us to tempt God if we
[22:16] make these signs that we ought to do
[22:19] them then it's not perfect Liberty when
[22:21] the signs become you ought to be doing
[22:24] this it becomes imperfect
[22:27] Liberty because we forfeit perfect
[22:29] Liberty by submitting to traditions of
[22:31] man or or giving into Satan's
[22:36] demands Galatians chapter 2: 3-5 kind of
[22:40] moved this up a little bit I didn't want
[22:41] to let this get lost and buried tonight
[22:43] but it says and there's if you could go
[22:46] back and read more of this in Galatians
[22:48] I've been drawn a lot from the letter to
[22:50] the
[22:51] Galatians because he he he tells them
[22:53] earlier I can't believe you're so soon
[22:56] removed from the gospel that set you
[22:59] free so neither Titus who was with me
[23:01] being a Greek was compelled uh was
[23:04] compelled to be circumcised other words
[23:07] I didn't force them to be
[23:08] circumcised and that because the false
[23:10] Brethren unawares brought in who came in
[23:13] privy to spy out our Liberty which we
[23:16] have in Christ Jesus that we might BR
[23:19] that they might bring us into
[23:22] bondage spy out the Liberty you have in
[23:25] Christ now they want to spy it out they
[23:28] want to perform some
[23:29] Espionage and cause and compel Titus to
[23:33] be circum circumcised though he was a
[23:37] Greek caused him to be circumcised In
[23:40] the Flesh and he says that this is
[23:42] someone who is spying out and testing
[23:45] your bounds of Liberty in order to bring
[23:47] Titus back into the bond back out of
[23:50] bondage into bondage that the word The
[23:52] Gospel called him out of he says to whom
[23:55] he gave place by subjection no not for
[23:57] an hour we didn't give place to these
[24:00] false Brethren unawares spying out your
[24:03] Liberty that the truth of the Gospel
[24:06] might continue with
[24:08] you
[24:10] now maybe in a in a congregation you say
[24:14] that in this entire church everybody is
[24:16] circumcised I'm not talking about this
[24:18] one but in there in the time the Jews
[24:19] say hey all the men we were Jews we were
[24:21] Jews according to the law we're
[24:22] circumcised and now you have this new
[24:24] convert it's kind of like we all we've
[24:26] all we're all circumcised you need to be
[24:27] circumcised
[24:29] and Paul is saying we didn't give into
[24:30] that we didn't give into that for one
[24:32] moment that the truth of the Gospel
[24:35] might continue with you what is the
[24:37] truth of the Gospel look into Galatians
[24:39] it's justification by faith in Jesus
[24:42] Christ justification by faith not by
[24:45] works he wanted it to stand in the
[24:47] promise of God that by faith we are
[24:52] saved it's in Acts chapter 15 that you
[24:54] can look it up in in verse one where it
[24:56] speaks of these certain men which came
[24:57] down from Judea and taught that except
[25:00] you be circumcised after the man of
[25:02] Moses you cannot be
[25:04] saved what was this the adding of a
[25:06] fleshly evidence or work the adding of
[25:10] some ceremony the adding of a tradition
[25:13] that was visible that was
[25:16] confirmable and now it's important to
[25:18] recognize that to the Jews God gave them
[25:21] a sign a physical sign of circumcision
[25:23] that was evidence in the flesh that they
[25:25] were the Seed of Abraham certainly it
[25:27] was uh you could replicate it and you
[25:29] could impersonate it but yet to them it
[25:30] was a law that they must have abided by
[25:32] and now it's trying to be carried over
[25:34] in as a law in the and the circumcision
[25:37] of the heart is now to be made manifest
[25:39] In the Flesh as an evidence that you're
[25:40] a Christian and Paul's saying we did not
[25:43] give into that because it it erode from
[25:45] the truth of the Gospel now is it a sin
[25:48] to be circumcised is it wrong no no
[25:52] would it make him any less of a
[25:53] Christian absolutely not but when it's
[25:56] added to the gospel
[25:58] and they said it's that you have to do
[26:01] it after the manner of this person and
[26:03] after the manner of the law and this
[26:05] gospel you cannot be saved it's an
[26:07] evidence that you're in that was a
[26:10] defiling of the truth of the
[26:13] gospel Paul was advocating from the true
[26:16] Liberty which the Gentiles were then in
[26:19] Galatians
[26:20] rejecting Noti they had true Liberty but
[26:23] now they're rejecting that Liberty to be
[26:25] brought act back under bondage and I
[26:28] hope that I could say this and in doing
[26:29] so just capture a lot of things we've
[26:31] been teaching on lately but there's this
[26:33] humanistic fig Leaf
[26:37] instinct to do
[26:39] something to cover
[26:42] ourselves Works based evidence we want
[26:46] to have that security blanket I believe
[26:48] I believe
[26:50] and I
[26:53] also did
[26:55] this right now I realize that there
[27:00] is I I'll say this this is personal I
[27:03] apologize if I'm pulling back the
[27:04] curtain a little bit too much my comfort
[27:07] is in Revelation the revealed word of
[27:10] God my comfort is in faith it's where
[27:12] you got to stand it's where you got to
[27:14] Anchor and one of the one of the common
[27:17] arguments against only believe is that
[27:20] you make believing too
[27:23] easy and and and so that if you just say
[27:26] just believe then some people are just
[27:28] going to
[27:30] believe and and I get it that there's a
[27:33] way that the gospel can be so watered
[27:35] down where you just tell people to have
[27:36] faith and in having faith it's become
[27:39] just so easy for them to think that
[27:41] they're a Believer just because they
[27:43] have mentally ascented to something but
[27:46] as soon as you change only believe and
[27:49] in defense of them making it too easy
[27:51] and it's called maybe easy believism in
[27:53] our defense against that we want to make
[27:55] it harder the only thing you do is you
[27:59] harm the True
[28:01] Believer cuz when you say no no no no no
[28:04] it's not only believe it's only believe
[28:06] plus and you know what the make believer
[28:07] says
[28:09] amen right and you know what the
[28:12] non-believer says I don't believe it
[28:15] anyways and you know what the believer
[28:17] says I don't
[28:19] know I don't know am I not in
[28:21] it am I missing something man I'm
[28:25] anchored in this word I believe it with
[28:26] all my heart I walk in dry places and I
[28:28] feel that he's testing me so I'm sure
[28:30] that I'm standing on thus sayith the
[28:32] Lord and nothing else but now I got
[28:33] somebody who's yelled and screaming in
[28:35] my face telling me that I better do this
[28:37] and better do that or I'm not in
[28:41] it and I'm and I'm
[28:44] thinking man anybody that's had easy
[28:46] believism you clearly didn't
[28:50] believe right if anybody ever said it
[28:52] was easy just believing guess what you
[28:54] weren't believing that's why the devil
[28:56] wasn't worried about you
[28:59] right you were following him the whole
[29:00] time he was just dangling the carrot hey
[29:03] this is
[29:04] great but when you go to believing and
[29:06] believing only and beli in the word of
[29:08] God and taking every word of God and
[29:10] feeding on every word of God and and
[29:11] taking them at his word and saying I'm
[29:13] going to live by bread alone the devil
[29:15] doesn't make that easy at
[29:17] all so it becomes our security
[29:20] blanket let me know when I've been 40
[29:23] minutes and the sermon thirst brother
[29:25] bradam says and there is also just
[29:27] people who live upon the emotions I we
[29:28] realize there's two sides by the kidy
[29:30] digs did a great job on that he says
[29:33] some people say well we got a lot of
[29:34] that in our Pentecostal movement and
[29:37] they'll go in which is fine they'll pat
[29:39] their hands and play the music the music
[29:41] stops a bucket of water went over the
[29:43] thing over everything now we got in a
[29:46] habit of habit of doing that it's just
[29:48] become one of our
[29:50] customs now be don't don't get uh pick
[29:54] up your pitchforks and want to run after
[29:55] the
[29:56] musicians that's not what he saying
[29:58] saying this this custom this tradition
[30:00] that follows it and people are living on
[30:01] these emotions and he says it's fine
[30:03] they pat their hands they play the music
[30:05] but then as soon as the Music Stops it's
[30:06] as if the signs are no longer
[30:09] effective the manifestations the works
[30:11] these things it's almost like they stop
[30:14] and he says when you're worshiping God
[30:17] in the spirit and in
[30:21] truth when it becomes accustom for you
[30:23] to do it because you think you ought to
[30:25] do it because you think if you don't
[30:27] shout or up and down or dance with the
[30:29] music your neighbor is going to think
[30:30] you're backslid you're drinking from a
[30:32] stagnated
[30:35] stream notice what's happened is where
[30:38] the spirit of the Lord is there's
[30:39] liberty oh I'm so glad that I could come
[30:42] to
[30:43] church and I can be at home I could be
[30:46] at peace in his presence and I respond
[30:48] to the word in a way that I'm free to
[30:52] and then all of a sudden it becomes one
[30:53] of these things like well you notice
[30:55] Brother Martin never claps
[30:59] can't say that anymore do you notice he
[31:02] doesn't clap very much he just kind of
[31:04] like and then it's like okay now I got a
[31:07] clap you ever been in a church where
[31:09] everybody always stands and you're over
[31:11] there
[31:13] going guess I better
[31:15] stand right because it's custom and you
[31:19] feel as if you're not standing you're
[31:20] going to be the one that's going to be
[31:21] railed on during the service right and
[31:23] you people that don't have the audacity
[31:25] to stand when the spirit of God's moving
[31:26] you're like hey buddy I'm in a
[31:27] wheelchair
[31:30] CH so when it's a custom you think you
[31:33] ought to notice how he says you ought to
[31:35] do it that's not Liberty anymore true
[31:38] Spirit of the Lord's not there anymore
[31:40] says your backslid he said right until
[31:42] it fills every fiber until the Holy
[31:44] Ghost itself is bubbling in you I don't
[31:46] care whether the music is playing
[31:47] whether they're playing near my God to
[31:48] thee or whatever it is the holy spirit
[31:50] still ringing the glory bells in your
[31:51] heart that satisfies notice the
[31:54] satisfaction is when it's
[31:56] inside I'm at peace amen I'm at peace
[31:59] that's God's satisfying portion anything
[32:02] less than that you're
[32:04] done you might speak with tongue like
[32:07] men and angels you might give all your
[32:08] goods to feed the poor you might
[32:10] prophesy you might have knowledge
[32:12] understand all Mysteries and all these
[32:13] things and you still become nothing 1
[32:14] Corinthians 13 until that satisfying
[32:17] something that can only quench that
[32:18] thirst my soul thirst for the Living God
[32:21] like the heart panted for the water
[32:22] Brook until I can find it I'll perish
[32:25] when you get to hungering for God like
[32:27] that something is going to take place
[32:29] the spirit is to lead you to those great
[32:32] fountains now there's a good thing to
[32:35] Worship in the spirit that's true but
[32:38] sometimes you have Spirit without
[32:41] truth John 4 said we worship God spirit
[32:44] and
[32:45] Truth notice there's a spirit where the
[32:48] spirit of the Lord there is Liberty but
[32:50] you're taking your Liberties when you
[32:52] add to or take away from the
[32:54] truth that's exactly right Jesus is the
[32:56] truth that's exactly right and he is the
[32:59] word the streams of God sent to satisfy
[33:02] you is the word he says in the natural
[33:04] Satan's polluted every one of them the
[33:06] Natural Things even the things that we
[33:08] can enjoy and we should have Liberty to
[33:10] enjoy Satan's polluted them by what
[33:12] adding a word to
[33:14] it by taking away he's poisoned he has
[33:18] put the poison dope in everyone that he
[33:21] could get into that's right he took that
[33:23] great stream of the church that was
[33:25] God's way Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll
[33:27] build my church and the gates of hell
[33:28] can't Prevail against it now there's
[33:30] different arguments on that Roman people
[33:32] the Catholic say it's built upon Peter
[33:34] that be so Peter backslid in a few days
[33:36] so it wasn't sure it wasn't built upon
[33:38] Peter Petra The Rock and then the
[33:40] Protestant says he's built upon himself
[33:41] Jesus Christ not to be different but a
[33:43] different with them he never built it on
[33:45] either one he built it upon the
[33:46] revelation of who he
[33:48] was he said blessed art thou Simon son
[33:51] of Jonah's Flesh and Blood never
[33:52] revealed this to you but my Father which
[33:53] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[33:55] not by knowledge you didn't learn it by
[33:57] books you didn't learn it by joining
[33:59] Church you didn't learn it in the
[34:02] shouts didn't learn it in the runs but
[34:05] the Holy Ghost itself has brought the
[34:07] person of Jesus Christ to you then Upon
[34:10] This Rock Revelation Faith I'll build my
[34:12] church and the Gates of Hell cannot
[34:15] Prevail against that that can't be
[34:17] poisoned the holy thirst has been
[34:19] satisfied in the person of Jesus Christ
[34:22] there you are that's the thing you want
[34:24] to look for satisfy that thirst with
[34:27] that amen lest there be some longing
[34:30] some wanness some lust that you've got
[34:33] to satisfy some itch that you've got to
[34:35] scratch with something else other than
[34:37] the revealed
[34:41] word that's the satisfying
[34:44] portion now I think I've used this quite
[34:47] a bit so I hope I'm not just beating a
[34:50] dead Penny but in Matthew chapter 7: 21-
[34:53] 24 he says not everyone that saith unto
[34:55] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[34:57] Kingdom of Heaven but he that doeth the
[35:00] will of My Father which is in heaven
[35:02] remember James built his entire premise
[35:04] of perfect law of Liberty is he that
[35:06] hears the word and doesn't do it is one
[35:08] who beholds his own self in a mirror
[35:10] turns away and forgets who he was but we
[35:13] who look into the perfect law of Liberty
[35:15] we are those that hear and
[35:18] do says it in
[35:20] James but who so lookth into the perfect
[35:23] law of Liberty and continueth therein he
[35:25] being not a forgetful he but a doer of
[35:26] the work this man shall be blessed in
[35:28] his
[35:29] deed that's the perfect law of Liberty
[35:32] is to hear and then no longer be
[35:34] restrained by the
[35:36] flesh to no longer to be exempt from the
[35:39] base instincts and
[35:40] Natures but to do what the word of God
[35:43] says to
[35:46] do he that doeth the will of the Father
[35:48] which is in heaven not the glory glory
[35:50] Lord Lord but he that does the will of
[35:52] God many will say to me in that day Lord
[35:54] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[35:58] in thy name cast out devils and in thy
[36:00] name done many wonderful
[36:02] works now these
[36:05] works just even think of this wonderful
[36:07] Works versus Greater
[36:09] Works there's things that are a wonder
[36:11] and that we wonder at and things that
[36:13] take place and things that happen and
[36:15] they many they wonderful works and we
[36:17] could say that prophesying in his name
[36:19] uh would be nothing against that unless
[36:21] you're just
[36:22] lying but where there be prophecies and
[36:24] these different gifts and tongues the
[36:26] spirit can move in that but they can
[36:27] also be impersonated or represented as
[36:30] truth in thy name cast out Devils now
[36:33] there's people that try to do that the
[36:35] devil's like Paul I know Jesus I know
[36:37] but who are you and so there is it's not
[36:40] a guarantee that you can just say that
[36:42] you are a Believer and that happen yet
[36:44] we could say they did it with his name
[36:47] and done many wonderful works a lot of
[36:49] things that you could put under that
[36:50] banner and then I will profess unto them
[36:53] I never knew you depart from me ye that
[36:55] work iniquity now what's wrong was the
[37:00] iniquity prophesying in his name was the
[37:03] iniquity casting out Devils was the
[37:05] iniquity doing many wonderful
[37:07] works or did they hear the revealed word
[37:11] and didn't do it in other words they
[37:13] didn't do the Y they didn't do the the
[37:16] perfect Liberty they found imperfect
[37:18] Liberty they went to the Fig leaves they
[37:19] went to the cover they used their
[37:21] Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness they
[37:23] found themselves wanting and pursuing
[37:25] these other things instead of being and
[37:27] satisfied with the faith in the word of
[37:30] God and letting him do the rest they
[37:32] were enticed into these other things so
[37:34] he says depart from me you worked
[37:39] iniquity therefore whosoever heareth
[37:42] these sayings of mine and doeth him I
[37:44] will liken him unto a wise man which
[37:46] built his house upon a rock Upon This
[37:49] Rock I'll build my church upon the
[37:51] revelation of Jesus Christ the word if
[37:54] you go and continue to read who he
[37:55] Likens that that foolish man to the
[37:57] foolish rests upon Works he rest upon
[38:00] signs and not the word by faith it's
[38:03] built upon the Sands the flesh the
[38:06] shifting Sands the things that can be
[38:08] moved as the wind blows and a a and
[38:10] movement in Earth and man could easily
[38:12] move and
[38:14] manipulate that's what the foolish does
[38:16] but that man who hears and builds and
[38:19] does what the word of God said he's like
[38:20] a wise man who's built his this is true
[38:23] knowledge and understand he's built his
[38:25] house upon the rocken
[38:28] and maybe the man that builds his house
[38:30] upon the sand wants to be able to move
[38:32] it if he has
[38:34] to he doesn't want to get pinned down on
[38:36] doctorine he doesn't want to get pinned
[38:38] down on something he wants to be able to
[38:40] move if he has to well I thought it was
[38:42] this
[38:43] but oh wow do you see the meetings
[38:45] they're having these days right
[38:52] good oh I'm very I'm very near closing
[38:55] on this so I feel like like I'd have to
[38:58] give some I I want to be sure that I'm a
[39:01] proper uh properly standing for and
[39:05] defending the word of
[39:07] God the spirit of God works according to
[39:10] his word in
[39:12] healing the spirit of God works
[39:14] according to his word in in
[39:16] Miracles we believe in those things he's
[39:19] he's still a miracle working God we
[39:21] believe the spirit of God works
[39:22] according to his word in gifts yes sir
[39:26] there's things that we can bring back to
[39:28] the word of God but let me say this the
[39:30] word defines them the word gives it its
[39:32] scope the word is is showing us where
[39:34] it's at but let me emphasize this
[39:37] shouting dancing crying and these
[39:40] different things that we can do as
[39:42] humans it's a human response to the
[39:46] stimulus to a
[39:48] stimulus if you're crying when the
[39:50] spirit of the Lord moves you're not
[39:51] wrong for that but it's not Christ in
[39:54] you boohoo and true it's you
[39:59] when you shout you dance you cry you
[40:01] pass out whatever it is you do when the
[40:03] spirit of the Lord moves on you that's a
[40:05] human response to
[40:08] stimulus or it's
[40:12] manufactured that mass hysteria that
[40:14] begins to work in a very localized way
[40:16] where one person's doing another person
[40:18] does it and so one person can genuinely
[40:21] according to a physical humanistic
[40:23] response to stimulus the genuine power
[40:26] of the Holy Ghost causes someone to cry
[40:28] shout Dance Pass Out be slain in the
[40:30] spirit but recognize scripturally that
[40:33] those things are the humans response to
[40:36] it now I have a much larger uh study on
[40:40] this and maybe we could do a a series
[40:42] maybe in the 30s we could do a whole
[40:44] series for that decade on on the what
[40:48] what Pentecost was and what the move of
[40:50] God at Pentecost was and what the faith
[40:52] of the Pentecostal fathers manifested
[40:54] itself in and what's the single most ID
[40:57] identifiable characteristic of the day
[40:59] of
[41:00] Pentecost not tongues that had been done
[41:03] before not shouting or dancing because
[41:05] miam did that David did that before the
[41:07] Holy Ghost was even given to the
[41:10] church those were all Hebrew traditional
[41:14] ways of expressing themselves to a move
[41:17] of
[41:19] God there's the
[41:21] series trust me we can get a lot out of
[41:24] that
[41:31] the wise man
[41:33] though he does what the revealed word
[41:36] says he ought to
[41:38] do he's a hearer and a
[41:41] doer and if the word said you ought to
[41:44] be handling snakes we better be at
[41:46] petmart in the morning does that still
[41:48] exist we could make money selling snakes
[41:50] to message
[41:53] Believers it's your snakes are us
[41:56] seriously couldn't we do it
[41:57] are you a Believer if the word said you
[42:00] must no matter how scared you are of a
[42:03] snake your faith would say well then I
[42:05] better do
[42:06] it if the word said you better drink
[42:08] this poison because the word of God says
[42:10] you better drink this poison you know
[42:12] what we better pass the
[42:14] poison but the word doesn't say You must
[42:16] the word doesn't say you ought but the
[42:19] word says You must be baptized in the
[42:21] name of Jesus Christ and guess what you
[42:22] got wet guess what you did it in the
[42:24] name of Jesus Christ whatever the word
[42:26] says you ought to do you do it sir now
[42:30] are you saying signs shouldn't follow no
[42:32] signs ought to follow but that's his
[42:34] part
[42:37] yes whosoever lookth into the perfect
[42:40] law of Liberty hears sees and does he's
[42:44] not a forgetful here he's not a foolish
[42:46] man he's built upon Revelation he's the
[42:48] one that shall be blessed in his
[42:50] deed because he's a doer of the work
[42:53] what's the work of God what must we do
[42:55] to work the mighty works of God believe
[42:58] on him whom he hath
[43:01] sent the sermon Satan's
[43:05] Eden on the days of
[43:07] Jesus
[43:09] Satan he did the same thing remember how
[43:12] we talked about he poisoned every
[43:15] stream he poisoned their minds Again by
[43:19] deceit misinterpreting the word so the
[43:23] word had already been misinterpreted now
[43:24] he goes to the word and tries to
[43:26] misinterpret the word word to the word
[43:28] if thou be the Son of God now let me see
[43:30] you do something about
[43:32] it Jesus didn't clown for him he never
[43:36] did God is not a
[43:45] clown trying to remember the what do you
[43:47] call a guy who runs the
[43:49] circus guy in the Middle with a hat and
[43:51] the ring ring master I think we got too
[43:53] many ring
[43:54] Masters he don't have to answer anything
[43:57] that Satan asked Jesus said it is
[44:00] written man should not live by bread
[44:01] alone but by every word that proceeds
[44:03] out of the mouth of God he didn't have
[44:06] to clown from
[44:08] him he didn't have to make bread he
[44:11] could have done it but he'd been
[44:13] listening to the devil so he didn't have
[44:15] to listen to the
[44:17] devil just imagine a ring Master here's
[44:19] a lion an elephant whatever Beast you
[44:22] want to use brother said one of the
[44:24] worst things you see is an animal caged
[44:25] up that Eagle in a cage of human
[44:28] Traditions Born to Fly but now he's just
[44:30] doing
[44:31] tricks with the ring Master with a
[44:34] whip said he didn't have to clown for
[44:37] the devil and again it is religious sin
[44:40] as at the beginning so deceitful watch
[44:42] it now it's not just purely old everyday
[44:45] sin committing adultery and getting
[44:47] drunk using God's name in vain that's
[44:49] not it you remember years ago many of
[44:50] you hear the old-timers remember the
[44:52] sermon I preached on the disappointments
[44:54] at judgment the Harlot she ain't going
[44:56] to be disappointed there
[44:57] she knows where she's going the drunker
[44:59] ain't going to be disappointed there The
[45:00] Bootlegger The Gambler the liar the
[45:02] thief he's not going to be disappointed
[45:04] but the that man who thinks he's right
[45:07] there's the
[45:09] disappointment that's that fellow that
[45:11] says come say Lord haven't I preached
[45:14] the gospel have not I cast out devils in
[45:16] thy
[45:18] name if he had stopped it haven't I
[45:20] preached the gospel that might have been
[45:22] a
[45:24] clue but then it's the the resume
[45:28] could you imagine just hypothetically if
[45:30] there was this test genuine believer
[45:33] stands there judgment and
[45:35] says
[45:37] uh doesn't look good and you just said I
[45:41] believed you with all my heart whatever
[45:45] you must Christ he says Ah just kidding
[45:47] get in
[45:48] there right but it's the guy that comes
[45:51] up there who didn't have that kind of
[45:52] heart who didn't believe it was believe
[45:54] plus it was the word plus he's kind of
[45:56] like what what are you serious I did all
[45:59] this for you yeah Blood Sweat tears and
[46:03] all sorts of meetings and all sorts of
[46:04] stuff signs and wonders fall and you're
[46:06] going to banish Me to Hell fine then I
[46:09] wouldn't want to spend eternity with you
[46:11] anyways right you're not going to accept
[46:13] my righteousness you're not going to
[46:14] accept my works but that attitude that
[46:17] says I did what you asked Lord I
[46:18] believed you that's all I could do the
[46:19] rest was left up to you if there was
[46:21] something wrong in my faith that was
[46:22] lacking forgive me Lord if you just let
[46:25] me Pat your foot
[46:27] just let me spend a moment in your
[46:28] presence just let me say thank you for
[46:30] the joy I had on Earth I'll be dearly
[46:36] paid let me fi finalize with this
[46:39] scripture just
[46:40] finish just want to read this and
[46:42] closing Brothers you could come to your
[46:44] instruments in John 8: 31-38 remember
[46:47] this then said Jesus to those Jews which
[46:50] believed on him if you continue in my
[46:52] word then are you my disciples indeed
[46:55] and you shall know the the truth and the
[46:58] truth shall make you free what's the
[47:01] first place they wanted to
[47:03] go we be Abraham's seed and were never
[47:06] in bondage to any man how sayest thou
[47:09] you shall be made free they went first
[47:13] to Natural
[47:15] lineage they could go to the genealogy
[47:17] they could go to the records they could
[47:18] go to the reports they could prove it we
[47:20] be Abraham seed after the
[47:23] flesh so how is it we're not free well
[47:27] really it's freedom from sin Freedom
[47:29] From The Curse freedom from those base
[47:31] instincts freedom from actually having
[47:33] to descend directly from Abraham right
[47:36] to be as the stars of Heaven the
[47:38] spiritual seed the Royal Seed of
[47:40] Abraham and he tells him I say unto you
[47:42] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[47:45] of
[47:46] sin didn't matter what was in the flesh
[47:50] that wasn't What mattered in the end he
[47:51] said he that commits sin unbelief makes
[47:54] you a servant of unbelief yes and he
[47:58] says you want to kill me said the son in
[48:02] verse 36 if the sun therefore shall make
[48:04] you free you shall be free indeed I know
[48:06] that you're Abraham's seed I say after
[48:08] the flesh but you want to kill me why
[48:10] because my word isn't found in you you
[48:14] might be able to produce DNA that says
[48:16] you are genuinely indeed circumcised son
[48:20] of
[48:20] Abraham but my word is not in you
[48:27] [Music]
[48:32] I'm I'm saying it forcefully I'm being
[48:34] very plain in how I'm preaching this and
[48:38] I would not want anyone for a second to
[48:42] lose their Liberty in
[48:45] Christ by becoming that a fanatic a
[48:49] license or legalist with any of this but
[48:51] to realize at the end of the day C it's
[48:54] the word Christ the word is what matters
[48:56] the most my faith is going to carry me
[48:59] through
[49:00] everything it's going to be what carries
[49:02] me through everything and there's this
[49:05] molting process there's this wearing
[49:07] down there's this
[49:09] suffering I thought about it brother
[49:11] Christian when you shared that with me
[49:12] earlier this week and how uh where his
[49:14] heart was at he's just sharing how the
[49:16] Lord uh he'd been list just listening to
[49:19] uh anointed ones at the end
[49:20] time and then that that contrasting
[49:23] image in the scripture where there's
[49:24] people that are so arrogant and so
[49:26] vindictive and say whatever they want
[49:27] about people but then there's some
[49:29] people who stood on faith alone and
[49:31] didn't couldn't defend themselves
[49:33] couldn't have didn't have the signs and
[49:35] wonders and all this Vindication that
[49:36] some people have they stood by faith
[49:38] alone and they suffer and you know it's
[49:40] that suffering that's mellowed them out
[49:42] and brought out the sweetness of Christ
[49:45] where when they see something even
[49:47] though it may be as black as night
[49:49] they're like oh my God be
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] merciful because the word the word that
[49:57] faith in God's word that's what
[49:59] matters and I'll end I I'll end with
[50:03] this I didn't provide the quotation in a
[50:04] slide but brother brah in the sermon a
[50:07] trumpet gives an uncertain sound he says
[50:09] not nothing you try to do nothing you
[50:12] manufacture you can't manufacture you
[50:15] can't manufacture salvation you can't
[50:18] manufacture the gifts you got to Bear
[50:20] the gifts the Sheep doesn't manufacture
[50:23] wool he has wool because he's sheep he
[50:25] just Bears wool the cherry tree doesn't
[50:27] manufacture cherries it just Bears
[50:28] cherries because the life that's that of
[50:31] it's that way catch this it's the part
[50:33] that really drew me to this and the
[50:35] Church of the Living God doesn't inject
[50:37] this to try to make themselves look like
[50:41] something you don't have to be put
[50:44] peacock feathers in right you don't have
[50:46] to give the appearance you don't have to
[50:49] posture you don't have to puff up you
[50:50] don't have to try to make yourself look
[50:52] good you don't have to look like
[50:53] something they already they're already
[50:55] what they are by the gra of God and the
[50:58] word of God is joined with them and
[51:00] they're joined with the word and the
[51:01] works that was brought forth in that
[51:02] perfect one Jesus Christ God manifest In
[51:04] the Flesh will produce itself through
[51:06] every Born Again believer he said so
[51:08] amen nothing else that's something
[51:11] certain amen a certain
[51:15] sound those works that Christ did what
[51:18] what how did he how is his Works reduced
[51:22] to I do only that which the father
[51:26] commands me to
[51:27] do man shall not live by bread alone but
[51:30] by every word of God that that's that's
[51:33] my work I must work the works of him
[51:35] that sent me while it's day that's my
[51:37] meat is to do his
[51:39] will and the bride she has the mind of
[51:43] Christ she has the same harmony with
[51:45] Christ the word because she's been
[51:47] joined to the word so she doesn't feel
[51:49] the need to step out beyond that to
[51:52] prove she's
[51:54] wife she already knows
[51:57] she knows and she's like I don't have to
[51:59] front right I I I don't have to try to
[52:04] pretend and it's almost as everybody's
[52:07] trying to
[52:08] flaunt and you don't have to because you
[52:11] don't have to clown you don't have to
[52:13] front for the devil you don't have to be
[52:16] like that's my man you can just stand on
[52:18] the word of God and know that he is
[52:21] yours you are his am you're his he is
[52:24] your beloved and you are his amen
[52:27] and
[52:28] rest in the Liberty that you have as his
[52:31] wife
