TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on Wednesday night we began um a subject on Liberty there's been a few things that we've said over the last uh several months on freedom and liberty I think even going back to some things last year uh we've touched on some of these same principles and we talked about perfect Liberty on Wednesday night we even were able to use it in the context of the Declaration of Independence and the Liberty that we have as uh Americans and we kind of identified just what a difficult dance um Liberty can be where some want freedom and then in their freedom of speech or freedom of expression uh freedom to choose and freedom of of of the press and all these different freedoms that we lift up and that we have that there's this limit to it that if Freedom doesn't have any anchor Freedom doesn't have any boundaries then it either destroys civilization or it requires a dictator or a despotism to come and to reign as a uh tyrannical leader over the people in order to ensure civilization so we're just kind of seeing that Razor's Edge of freedom and liberty and then looking into the scripture to find out what is this Liberty uh that we enjoy in Christ and today we're going to use the title imperfect Liberty Wednesday night was perfect Liberty today is imperfect Liberty and uh Lord willing may be Wednesday we may Minister on um Liberty being practice what does it mean to exercise our Liberty and the Hebrew excuse me the Greek word that used for Liberty in the scripture uh it could have been translated to Freedom the freedom that we have in Christ it means to be free uh kind of has its roots in being freeorn and and a citizen one who has all rights and privileges as a citizen and and it's maybe at its core not necessarily its use but it kind of means to be exempt from and so you're exempt some from something you're you're not restrained or kept from uh enjoying certain things so to have this Liberty of freedom is the absence of restraint you're not bound by any particular obligation or debt or Duty and it speaks of even this deliverance from bondage and in doing so uh it this is the word that's used even in the scripture this absence of restraint the deliverance from bondage uh the not bound by some sort of obligation and the modern idea of Liberty is kind of like the power of self-determination that I have the right the free will this right to determine my own Direction the freedom to do as one pleases and it's there that people exercising their Liberty begin to take Liberties and and do things that go beyond the bounds of what is proper and I've never had so many fans this morning this is I don't know if it's going to you know make me preach longer it's like they're taking care of it they're going to be okay or if I need to cut it short but I asked the question what does it mean to be free or have Liberty let me just interject we've been in discussion and we're hopeful that we can add to our air cold air capacity here very very soon and and so you won't necessarily need to keep Fanning Lord willing we can get that done as soon as possible just bear with it and make it through it's better than what it could be and I trust that the word will word will what will be what matters the most so the question could be what is it mean to have Liberty it's a question that people wrestle with in a Democratic Society it's a question a lot of people ask themselves that they're living in other countries where there's not a lot of freedoms or rights but I think it's more uh I'm looking at it more necessarily scripturally what does it mean to be free or to have this Liberty and some of the thoughts that have kind of been coming to me and I've been putting them aside and kind of building in this area is uh kind of the idea that if you're in a place that you dwell and you don't feel welcome uh it's kind that you don't you don't have Liberty uh you don't feel that you can maybe say something or do something and it has a sense of being free has the sense of feeling at home or having some sort of ownership uh for those of us who rent properties and so we're renting where we live live we're not just free to do whatever we want to it without consequence we may be feel free to do it but there may be some consequence later if we say well I don't like this wall here I'm just going to tear it out and then you go to move out and the landlord says wait a minute what happened to my wall that was a special wall and then you're going to end up there's some sort of consequence or payment uh that would be owed so there's this idea of feeling at home and having ownership and belonging that speaks to this idea of Liberty and being free if one is in their home country they have certain rights and privileges if one feels at home they'll they'll exercise certain Liberties and so this concept of Liberty has application to how we live our lives has application to our homes has application to our churches and that's why I've just felt impressed to keep it in that vein of the house of the Lord and what it means to be a Dwelling Place of God what it means to make our homes Dwelling Places and what it means for our church to be a place that God's presence is welcome and today I'm hoping to set this forth in a way to where it can kind of be a setup for exercis in our Liberty and how that relates to our home life now in 2 Corinthians chapter 3: 17 and 18 uh Paul is writing about the glory of the Lord and how that Minds have been blinded and even reference to the Veil that was over Moses's face face and then there's going to be a turning to the Lord and the veil will be removed so it's revealing we can even see this idea of Christ being revealed this this unveiling of Christ and once Christ has been revealed there's this loosing that takes place to the individual to where now they have Liberty and freedom at the revelation of Jesus Christ and so he says and now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there is freedom there is exemption from something and then lest we get the wrong idea or concept of what this Liberty is Paul kind of puts his finger on the true meaning of Liberty in Christ and gives us this real meaning he says but we all now with this Liberty we all with open face beholding as in a mirror as in a glass the glory of the Lord this revealing of Jesus Christ where we can see him as he is we are changed into the same image of Christ into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so this scripture is setting forth the principle where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty it means we have been set at Liberty to be formed into the image and the nature of Christ that we are partakers of his divine nature being partakers of his divine nature we can be changed in this process of maturing into his very image so Liberty here is freedom to become it's freedom from our our habits it's freedom from our human thinking it's freedom from the worst of our human ity that's what this where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty now I would argue or or maybe incorrectly assume that we usually hear this statement where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty to describe what takes place within a church service I think that's for myself that's the only context I think I've ever heard it in is where the spirit of the Lord there is there is Liberty to act how you feel to act and so this uh and I'm not I'm I'm not making the point at least at this point that that's not the case but rather as we look at the scripture really what does it mean what is it setting forth It's that we would see Christ and in seeing Christ would be changed and where Christ has been revealed we're loosed we're no longer bound we're free to be changed into this image of Christ James is the one that uses this phrase the perfect law of Liberty in James 1: 25 and he's touching on a very similar concept but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful here but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so it's the same idea that when we uh the perfect law of Liberty when we look into Christ who is that Spirit when we look into the mirror when we have this look into the perfect law of Liberty and continue therein we are changed one that's doing that is not just to hear but a doer and if you could maybe just write in the margin a a doer of the word not just a hear cuz those those that hear his word and do it are likened unto a certain individual and it all ties into this idea of Liberty so this perfect law of Liberty is the same it's found in Christ the word it's found by continuing therein by looking into and gazing upon the word we are free if he's been unveiled and we've been loosed then we're free to take it to eat it it up to look into it it's all right it's something that we can do and we could again just touch on just to so you're thinking about this in a very practical way what does this mean for a church service and for worship and uh uh and and church order and how God would want things to be operated not just in church but in our lives in our thinking in our actions James chapter 8: 31- 38 excuse me John chapter 8 some of you Bible scholars are like but James chapter 8 John chapter 8: 31-38 then said Jesus to the Jews which believed on him because James is saying as he that looks into the word and continues therein is looking into the perfect law of Liberty and it's changed he's a doer of the work he says if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free maybe one of the most outstanding scriptures on Liberty of freedom ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free not necessarily set you free but it's going to make you free now to say make you free if we even use it in the sense of make you freeorn and make you a a citizen or a member of the Kingdom then you'd recognize you can begin to kind of understand why the Jews who heard this took such offense to it because they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free we are we are not of the of the Heathen Nations we are not of a unchosen generation we are kingdoms of priest unto God and we are Abraham's seed therefore we have never been in bondage to any man and Christ is saying that if you hear my word and continue therein you will be made free you'll know the truth and the truth shall make you free they said we're we are free men we are at Liberty so Jesus answers and then kind of shines a light on what Liberty is says Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin this is telling us what our Liberty is that he whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever so there's your concept of a son who would be a free man a son who would have all rights and privileges of being a son and how that the servant can abide in the house but he has no rights and just to the house he's Bound by some other he's not exempt from some sort of other obligation but the son abides forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed I know that you are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you so it's the word having place it's the word having preeminence it's the word that uh gives us our Liberty I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which you have seen with your father quite a statement especially when it comes to Liberty and and we're not born of fornication and we're Abraham's seed and we are free but Jesus is showing giving us these images of one who exists within a house within a home as a free man with Liberty with rights and Privileges and that one who is a servant and he's saying though you might claim to be in the house of Abraham you are a liberty it is a sin to disbelieve God's word Liberty is freedom from unbelief and its attributes freedom from deception freedom from the LIE every word of God to not live by bread alone but by live by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God how I so perfect Liberty is this freedom and it's Central it's Central to freedom from sin freedom from unbelief I had a statement here that I wanted to read from anointed ones at the end time I believe it was let me just check and make sure that it might have been um from Satan's Eden yeah I think it's maybe from well I don't remember where it is but I changed the order yesterday and so that this statement seems to be kind of a jump I maybe what we'll say later we'll kind of fill it in but perfect Liberty brother BR talks about how certain things can be perverted righteousness perverted and a truth perverted and is what you get wickedness and you get a lie perfect Liberty can be perverted into imperfect Liberty we could say perverted Liberty but it's an imperfect Liberty where and I'll say it this way you may have that right to do it to do it may not be sin but to call that perfect Liberty is not the case it's not the perfect Liberty that God has given us necessarily when we make it into something that it's not so when I use the phrase imperfect Liberty I'm speaking of maybe the promise of Liberty or the appearance of Liberty but in reality it becomes bondage that where in exercising my right as a free man in exercising my rights as an American or exercising my rights as a human being or in even exercising the Liberty that I have in Christ as a free man this is what I have the right to enjoy and this is what I have the right to be and to do that we say it based upon this Liberty that I have I'm free to do this but actually in doing it we're no longer free we come into bondage uh please note this this is at the very hor inspired this entire thing and you'll recognize this phrase even in the scripture if you look into the Greek Lexicon and the meaning of this perfect law of Liberty and this Liberty that Paul is speaking at where the spirit of Lord there is Liberty to the meaning behind this even to the Jews would be to live as one ought to live the to have perfect Liberty means I can live the way that I should I can live the way that I ought to I can live by the way that is corre correct it's doing what is correct I am free to fulfill my duty that is expected of me as as a son or as what I am so it's to live as one ought to and so to live as we ought to is to abide in to abide and live as God desires us to that whatever the word would expect whatever one's expectations are because when we say well you ought to have done this in other words there's a certain expectation and then you do it you ought to have done this you ought to have done that you you understand that if we're to live as we ought to it means we we do what's expected of us so when we have Liberty we can do as the word expects us when we have Liberty we can live as God would desire us to live now I realize that runs counter to our leot deian idea of Liberty in that we have people's rights it's like well I don't want to do what you say and I don't want to live like you want me to live so imperfect Liberty would be this that one would live as one wants to one lives doing what they please doing what pleases the Flesh and and and may be saying this is what I want to do therefore it's what I ought to do and me wanting to do this and me exercising this and doing this this is what this is who I am and this is what I feel I should be and so perfect Liberty is to do as you should or as you ought it's the correct way to live imperfect Liberty is just doing what you want now to see this in scripture in 1 Peter Chap 2: 13-6 and there's a a lot in this 1 Peter chapter 2: 13-6 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to the king as Supreme I wonder if our founding fathers ever read 1 Peter chapter 2 it's interesting when you begin to drill down on certain things and America is a great nation and you'll find that they did certain things that we could find in the scripture where well wait a minute so it just speaks to sometimes the Paradox we find in the word of God he says submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto Governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well that's quite a statement it may be written in a language that's difficult for us to understand but he's saying as Christians submit yourself to the law of the land submit yourself to Governors and Mayors and submit yourself to law enforcement and and do what you ought to he says for so is the will of God now there's a reason for this especially in the birth of Christianity and especially what Christianity represents and stands for it says so for so is the will of God that with wello you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men that if if Christianity well Christianity did exactly what Peter was was saying we shouldn't do that it becomes marked by rebellion and Crusades and killing of other people who don't believe the same way and the overthrowing of governments and the eradication and genocide of people that don't feel the same way you do and so he saying we should not engage in these acts so that we would put to silence the ignorance of foolish men that say oh well Christianity is just an attempt to evade this and to rebel against that and to have it the way that you want it so he says as free we are free and not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as Servants of God being made free from sin by the word says we do not use our Liberty as a veil of evil we do not use the Liberty that we have in Christ and the freedom to do these things which we feel that we want to do a as a a cloak over Wicked intent Pride or vanity so our freedom does not give us license to do whatever we want our Liberty in Christ does not give us license to do whatever we please our Liberty in Christ we understand does not allow us to live contrary to the word of God Paul addresses the idea of Grace and this oh well since Grace is for my sin do I sin more so that there could be more grace and he says no that's foolishness so our Liberty in Christ does not allow us to to live and does not give us Liberty or license or the right to live contrary to God's word and Peter is saying nor does it give you the right or it uh authorize you to rebel against Authority and I would say this is the general rule this is the general setting forth we could read in other places we'll do so here in a minute in second Peter but our Liberty we cannot use he says the cloak of maliciousness so well I'm free to do this and I can say this and I can do this can't use this under the pretense of Christian Liberty should we ever under the pretense of being free under the pretense of being a message believer under the pretense of being bright should we ever use our Liberty to hurt somebody else we should never use our Liberty to destroy somebody else's property Peter's saying that we ought to obey ordinances and we ought to show respect and we we shouldn't conduct ourselves in a certain way to where just because we're Christians we have a right to do this we have a right to do that saying that we should never use our Christian Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness to hurt somebody or to destroy somebody else's property now the reason why this is such appointed letter is the Jews profess this duty to God and in their duty to God Alone they continually rebelled against Authority because they'd say well our duut is to God we don't have to do this and our duy is to God we don't have to do that and they were always using their Liberty as Jesus said that oh I know your sons have Abraham but you seek to kill me and and they would be willing to void and violate Roman law and those that ruled over them saying well we we be the Seed of Abraham and we're sons of God and he's saying God's word doesn't even abide in you so they used their Liberty as a pretext for Rebellion they used it to to vindicate and justify acts of sedition they used it to claim that as go children of God are as the Chosen and as his Nation they could do whatever they wanted and it was justified now I'll say this at the risk of getting cancelled it may be accepted by others so you get canceled on one and you get spun up by the other but just because the Jews are God's chosen people doesn't mean every single thing they do is right and I think where there's this idea that's propagated within nominal Christianity support the Jews support the Jews to where if they do something praise the Lord God's chosen people and so I just throw this out there as a caution yes they're God's chosen people yes we can scripturally identify them a a and there's a great preciousness to to Israel in Jerusalem and to the Jews and God is going to visit them again and he's going to reveal himself to them but we cannot fall under the same mindset that they have today that they had then that Peter's rebuking that you use the fact that you are the chosen people and and the children of God as a justification for evil conduct for sedici rebellions and and coup attempts you name it and so this is that imperfect Liberty that uh Peter's talking about or I say that Peter's referring to this imperfect Liberty because you use your Liberty for the wrong things and to me the part that is so amazing is that while reading this he's saying submit and Obey do what is right right and he says using as free you you we would be thinking well I guess I don't have any rights anymore guess I'm not free to do whatever I want but he's say no as free and as this the great qualifier Servants of God we're free but we're not without a duty we're at Liberty but not without some uh correct Behavior or expectation of us so this perverted Liberty that Peter is referring to this imperfect Liberty where we use it to do to justify the wrong kind of act it leads us away from God's perfect will so we cannot use Liberty I want you to recognize this part in particular because I don't feel that I need to so much emphasize this now we cannot use Liberty in Christ to indulge in sinful Behavior cannot use Liberty as a cloak of lasciviousness a cloak of indulgence to where we do unrighteousness to satisfy the desires of the flesh and I want to take it a step further we cannot use the justification of Liberty to justify anything that we would do in the flesh that we would be able to make anything that we want to do and ought to do in second Peter chapter 2 I wanted to read the entire chapter and I'm glad I I made this wise decision not to do so because it would just prolong the inevitable take the name of Jesus with you that some of you are already humming in second Peter chapter 2 he is warning against false prophets you see this at the very beginning and teachers that deny the Lord though they may profess him they're denying him so in verse 10 let's just read through this so we could kind of get uh take in just kind of get the bouquet of what uh uh uh Peter's talking about here before we take a sip but chiefly them that walk after the Flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government I maybe the people that read this we like man Peter just won't leave this alone first letter he's talking about obey the governors and the leaders and the King Supreme and now he's talking about us who despise government presumptuous are they self-willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities man such a uh powerful statement whereas Angels which are great in power and might bring not raing accusation against them before the Lord but these As Natural brute Beast made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption recently a brother did something and and the response to him is I see that you have not outgrown your hobell shoes I was like that is a perfect response because it was kind of like it was such a like why would you have the audacity to do that because Angels you know Fear To Tread on the place that you just put on your hobn shoes and trounced all over and he's saying here that even angels in their power and might don't do the same kind of railings that you do this presumptuous self-willed ignorance that is causing you to perish in your own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they count it pleasure to Riot in the daytime spots they are in blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceiving while they Feast with you spots in our Feast of Charity brother bam talks about how we're not in a festival this isn't a festival of chaos but this is a feast the solemn Feast he says having eyes full of adultery that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls and a heart they have exercised with Covetous practices cursed children are you you able to paint the picture this morning what Peter's dealing with which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balum the son of basor who loved the wages of unrighteousness but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumbass speaking with man's voice forbade The Madness of the Prophet I think we should do a series on this chapter these are wells without water clouds that are carried with the temptest they're empty they're Bluffs they're lying to whom the Mist Of Darkness is reserved forever for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they Allure through the lust of the flesh now I think sometimes when we say great words of vanity we like to say oh those are the teachers those are the ones that are teaching and and they're causing those with these these great technical words and with their degrees they're teaching things and breaking things down but notice how he says they great swelling words of vanity it's not so much that it's educated and it's articulate I'm not trying to give myself a defense today but it's that they use these empty words they're swelling they don't have substance they've just kind of puffed them up so they look bigger than they are and what it does is it attracts the flesh it allur the lust of the flesh through much wanness those that were clean escaped from them who lived in ER while they promise them Liberty notice how through the allurement of the flesh the excitement of the emotions and these and these Sensations these great swelling words of Pride Allure the lust of the flesh through what wanting and longing to be as one wants to not necessarily as the ought to says while they promise them Liberty so here's the promise of Liberty that through great swelling words of vanity alluring the lust of the Flesh and pro uh uh provoking your longing they're promising you Liberty to be free they themselves are the Servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought in bondage if you're overcome by something you're servant to it for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them while promising Liberty from what the holy commandment oh that's just too much you're being asked to do too much it's not necessary to do this or you don't have to abide by that or you can do this and you can do that but it has happened unto them according to the true proverb and the find where brother Bram touched on this in many places the dog has turned to his own vomit again and the s that was washed to her wallowing in the M brother Brandon most often referred to the Pentecostal movement when using this scripture now in the sermon the anointed ones at the end time and I'm reading this because brother brandham and I'm reading it here because brother Bam's making reference to the uh to balum here and then I you see how brother bandam uses this the anointed ones at the end time how many are recently familiar with the anointed ones at the end time listen to it recently I think we're all maybe familiar to as message Believers but it's such a important sermon oh you people don't miss this these imposters impersonators appeared after the true one had went first they come to impersonate now there is if we could look at this statement that when one is entangled in something and then is overcome again with it so like if you've been made free from something some idea some requirement some obligation some some thought process once you've been made free from it to get tangled up back in it again is like a dog going to its vomit hog to its Waller and and he's saying that this is not actually Freedom that if God's called you out of bondage called you out of dark denominationalism called you out of something then to exercise your Liberty to begin to lift and pick those things back up is worse than when you were just in it to begin with and now there is this danger then in this impers impersonation and he's saying that these impersonators come after the true they come to impersonate to mimic and to copy something that's been done before he says they have to the devil cannot create anything he's just a perverter of the original so if if sin is right rightousness perverted and adultery is the right act perverted and a lie is the truth misrepresented of perversion then Liberty can become bondage or bondage is Liberty perverted servitude slavery is Liberty perverted because there are some that actually are choosing bondage because of the appearance and the promise of Liberty he says look at haniah a perversion of the original word look at balum a perversion of the original word look at zedekiah the perversion of the original word now hold those in mind I want to come to the scripture here in a moment and the Bible said that these guys would come out to pervert the original word word Vindicated and proved to be true and then he begins to refer to the very thing that he put in the Cornerstone when he founded the Tabernacle do the work of an evangelist in that corner Yonder make full proof of your ministry for the time will come when they'll not endure sound Doctrine so they they don't want Doctrine they don't want teaching the sound Doctrine here could be to uh translate to sound teaching but after their own lust shall Heap for themselves teachers having inching ears the the root of their Doctrine the root of their teaching is in their desires of the Flesh and listen he says and go ahead and do anything they want to so this is a means of justifying themselves that they'll find those that can teach things in such a way that satisfies their itch because of the lust of the Flesh and then he says and this is what they say it's all right we got the same signs and wonders and shall be turned from the truth and be brought into fables and dogmas in second Timothy chapter 4 when it refers to these fables it's a fiction it's an invention it's a falsehood something that's been made up he said look at haniah perversion of the original look at balum a perversion of the original look at zedekiah perversion of the original Jeremiah 18:15 then said the Prophet Jeremiah unto haniah the prophet haniah was prophesying these great things big things all you're going to enjoy this is going to be great this is what we should do this is wonderful here now hananiah the Lord hath not sent thee did I not include Jeremiah 28 well look at that that's a sign to stop the Prophet Jeremiah and haniah he now haniah the Lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a li while promising Liberty they themselves are the Servants of corruption therefore what they teach and what they preach is bondage itself because they are in the bondage to Corruption of the word they're a bondage of Corruption of the truth they say we love the truth they say we love the word they say that they if Embrace certain things about the word but they use that as a cloak of lies and falsities and deceptions they use it as a cloak that adds to and takes away hananiah the prophet he says the Lord has not sent you because you make the people to trust in a lie remember zedekiah what did he do in his great big display and making horns of and this great dramatic demonstration and exercise of showing that the Lord is with you and you'll drive them out from before you but zedekiah had a lying spirit in his mouth balum used his gift for personal gain because it made him look good and what did he do he used it to entice the people into idolatry and a festival a dancing and a Frolic and a feasting on the wrong things a mixing and a blending of idolatry with the true word brother bandam addresses it in the church a book he says they give the word meaning that fits their own devilish ends they give now apply this to the Bible and the message of the hour they give it a meeting that fits their own devilish ends their own sit sensual ends these alluring through the lust of the flesh these the wanness through the promise of Liberty he says they operate gifts with the margin of error and neglect the word of God they operate gifts with the mar go back and read that passage in the church age book I should have jotted it down but uh and had it and I'm not going to take time to go through the church age book that I he have in front of me but find this if you need it just let me know I'll let you I'll identify it for you operating guest within a margin of error he describes what Christendom has become today this charismatic Christianity this Noir new age Revelation or whatever it is where there's there's prophecies with a margin of air there's no accountability when men whether they do it in a prayer line or they do it openly they can prophesy things they can say things they can interpret tongues and be absolutely incorrect denying the word of God and this is the direct quote and people will go to them and bear with them and support them and believe them not knowing it is the way of death I'll invite the musicians to come we'll stop there I think it'd be better if we just thought about that I'll pick up with this maybe Wednesday night maybe Sunday Sunday morning maybe we'll just do a part two on this one we're addressing the LIE of Liberty which is cloaked behind it is written and we we need to know but it is also written we need to we cannot let anyone misrepresent the word of God to draw us into wanness and the lust of the flesh he says and people will go with them and bear with them and support them and believe them not knowing it is the way of death could you stand together with me this morning
