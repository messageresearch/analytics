[0:00] amen amen romans chapter 9
[0:03] i'd like to
[0:04] read verses 1 to 13
[0:06] and i'm continuing on the subject of
[0:08] supreme faith revealed in abraham
[0:11] and
[0:12] i'm wanting to
[0:15] uh continue on what we were ministering
[0:17] on on sunday
[0:18] and i just made a statement at the end
[0:21] about isaac and um it seemed like that
[0:24] was uh
[0:25] what everybody had been waiting for so i
[0:27] may preach the wrong thing on sunday so
[0:28] i'm going to pre i'm preaching tonight
[0:30] what i didn't get to sunday
[0:32] didn't think i would have time to get to
[0:34] and then i made just a statement at the
[0:35] very end as i was closing and that may
[0:37] have been the most impactful statement
[0:39] so sometimes you sit in a service for
[0:41] two and a half hours just to hear a
[0:42] sentence at the end and so we're used to
[0:44] that and i trusted there was no grudge
[0:47] that was held because maybe i struggled
[0:49] through that service i felt awful that
[0:51] you guys had a pastor appreciation
[0:54] because i felt like that morning there
[0:55] was pastor depreciation that was taking
[0:57] place and so tonight hopefully we can
[0:59] redeem ourselves redeem the subject
[1:01] matter
[1:02] and continue on that same subject but
[1:04] focusing very narrowly now on something
[1:06] and i think it'll be a blessing to you
[1:08] romans chapter 9 verses 1-13 i say the
[1:12] truth in christ i lie not my conscience
[1:15] also bearing me witness in the holy
[1:17] ghost that i have great heaviness and
[1:19] continual sorrow in my heart
[1:21] for i i for i could wish that myself
[1:24] were cursed from christ for my brethren
[1:27] my kinsmen according to the flesh it's a
[1:29] phrase that's very important to catch
[1:30] here i'm gonna just pick up later on in
[1:33] verse six but this is tremendous
[1:34] background i think you can recall this
[1:36] later
[1:38] he's talking about the jews the nation
[1:40] those after the flesh you know the blood
[1:41] of abraham
[1:43] who are israelites to whom pertain of
[1:45] the adoption and the glory and the
[1:46] covenants and the giving of the law
[1:49] and the service of god and the promises
[1:51] these were given to israel the children
[1:53] of israel the children of isaac the
[1:55] children of jacob whose are the fathers
[1:57] and of whom as concerning the flesh
[2:00] christ came so he near identifying how
[2:03] he came according to the flesh who is
[2:05] over all god blessed forever amen then
[2:07] he says not as though the word of god
[2:09] hath taken none effect for they not for
[2:12] they are not all israel which are of
[2:14] israel very important concept now he's
[2:16] delineated between all israel and those
[2:19] who are
[2:20] called according to a promise
[2:22] neither because they are the seed of
[2:24] abraham are they all children but in
[2:26] isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[2:29] they which are the children of the flesh
[2:31] these are not the children of god but
[2:33] the children of the promise are counted
[2:35] for the seed for this is the word of
[2:37] promise at this time will i come and
[2:40] sarah shall have a son and not only this
[2:42] but when rebecca also had conceived by
[2:45] one even by our father isaac for the
[2:47] children being not yet born neither
[2:49] having done any good or evil that the
[2:51] purpose of god according to election
[2:52] might stand not of works but of him that
[2:55] calleth for it was said unto her the
[2:57] elder shall serve the younger as it is
[2:59] written jacob have i loved but esau have
[3:02] i hated
[3:03] lord bless you you could take your seats
[3:06] the lucas you can remain seated
[3:10] i'm just continuing on this supreme
[3:12] faith revealed in abraham
[3:14] we were reading in the bible last night
[3:16] as a family
[3:17] and it was in uh ezekiel
[3:20] and the where ezekiel is going to take a
[3:23] brick and he's going to
[3:25] draw a map and he's going to
[3:27] put these different elements together on
[3:29] this stone to depict the siege of
[3:32] jerusalem
[3:33] and in this translation we were reading
[3:35] it said god expresses this to his equal
[3:38] he says be sure you do write this out
[3:40] exactly how i tell you because all the
[3:42] specific details i'm sharing are
[3:44] important and i thought it was really
[3:45] remarkable how that uh then he begins to
[3:48] tell
[3:49] ezekiel to lay on his side for 300 and
[3:51] some 390 days and to to be laying on his
[3:54] side and then not turn over and then
[3:56] turn over and do this and all these
[3:57] different days in the days and the side
[4:00] and then what he was going to eat and
[4:02] what he was going to cook it over and
[4:03] everything all had a specific
[4:05] representation it all had a
[4:07] an intent behind it as god was having
[4:09] this prophet dramatize his attitude
[4:12] towards israel and it reminded me how
[4:14] that we're looking at the life of
[4:16] abraham
[4:17] and i'm being very uh i'm kind of
[4:19] zeroing in on certain specifics and the
[4:21] reason why is because the specifics in
[4:23] abraham's life not only tell his story
[4:26] but it also foreshadows our story
[4:29] and we see god dealing with abraham and
[4:31] doing certain things in abraham's life
[4:33] and we can zero in on a specific and see
[4:36] that oh this portrays this in my life or
[4:38] this represents a process in my own life
[4:41] and this is declaring to us certain
[4:43] aspects of our own salvation of our own
[4:46] election and grace and even how god
[4:48] deals with us as individuals than even
[4:50] how god deals with the church and so it
[4:52] makes the faith of abraham which
[4:54] ultimately becomes supreme
[4:56] it makes it relatable for us who are
[4:58] coming to supreme faith in this hour
[5:01] and we're using this statement i've been
[5:03] using this one over and over again
[5:04] though there's many that we could use in
[5:06] abraham's grace covenant brother brahms
[5:08] looking at a particular scriptural
[5:10] event in abraham's life and he says what
[5:13] is god doing he's showing to abraham
[5:15] this what he's going to do to abraham
[5:17] seed so he's doing something specific
[5:19] for abraham but he was also
[5:21] doing something to abraham that we in
[5:24] our day could look back and say oh what
[5:25] he's doing to abraham then this is he's
[5:28] doing it to us now in a spiritual way
[5:30] and so the bible is sharing these
[5:32] specific aspects in abraham's life
[5:34] because we could just be honest with
[5:36] ourselves the bible says it doesn't tell
[5:37] us everything abraham did
[5:40] right i mean we don't know it doesn't
[5:41] say it's not abraham's journal and then
[5:44] you know day one and day two when we're
[5:45] reading it and it's just this huge
[5:47] volume of a man that lived over 100
[5:49] years and had ended up having you know
[5:52] kids and multiple wives and uh and this
[5:55] big huge life covering volumes and
[5:56] volumes of moms it just gives us these
[5:58] little glimpses and and
[6:01] views into his life of certain
[6:02] incidences and so god is sharing these
[6:04] with us so the bible shares shares these
[6:06] details to give the proper context to
[6:09] his faith
[6:10] so we can see well this is where his
[6:12] faith is being developed and this is
[6:13] where his faith began and this is how
[6:16] his faith grew and this is his weak
[6:18] these are his weaknesses and this is the
[6:19] way that he went so we can identify a
[6:21] pattern
[6:22] we're recognizing a pattern what he's
[6:24] did to do it to abraham he does to
[6:26] abraham's seed and there's a process
[6:28] then that abraham goes through and we're
[6:30] in that same process
[6:32] we sunday i just want to make a few
[6:34] statements very quickly about on
[6:36] sunday's service we we're talking about
[6:37] how that from genesis 1 to genesis 11 is
[6:40] telling us a story that covers uh uh
[6:42] quite a long long period of time
[6:44] creation
[6:45] um even the fall of that creation and
[6:48] then this a new covenant is given to man
[6:50] and then it kind of gets to noah and
[6:52] then god judges the whole earth and then
[6:53] afterwards
[6:54] you have the um a quick narration until
[6:57] you get to genesis chapter 11
[6:59] and it's laying the foundation genesis 1
[7:02] to genesis 11 is laying the foundation
[7:04] of of election it's laying the
[7:06] foundation of faith and grace and
[7:08] salvation and these different elements
[7:10] and it's really providing the back story
[7:12] for abraham
[7:13] and when i say that i don't mean any i'm
[7:15] not trying to belittle what happens in
[7:16] genesis chapter one but really it's
[7:18] giving us context for
[7:20] the call of abraham
[7:22] and genesis chapter 11 the story of the
[7:24] tower of babel and the mindset of the
[7:26] people is showing us that god called
[7:29] abraham out of babylon and i don't think
[7:31] it was there's really some big reveal or
[7:33] mystery but i'm wanting to emphasize
[7:35] that and i emphasized babylon in great
[7:37] detail on sunday just to recognize the
[7:39] characteristics of it and how much it
[7:41] sounds like today the day that we're
[7:43] living in and when god calls abraham out
[7:46] of babylon the bible says he called him
[7:47] out of the city of ur
[7:48] in the land of the chaldees and i'm not
[7:50] going to read the scripture tonight but
[7:51] remember that he said god himself says
[7:53] abraham i called you out of er called
[7:56] you out of that city and he says i
[7:58] didn't call you to haran i called you to
[8:00] canaan i was calling you to this land
[8:02] but he calls him out of er and he and
[8:05] he's bringing him a certain way and
[8:06] that's the beginning of christianity
[8:09] and say well where did christianity
[8:10] begin it began not even when noah got
[8:13] off that ark it began
[8:15] when god called abraham out of this land
[8:19] of the chaldees and out of ur and out of
[8:21] babylon and this is such a beautiful
[8:24] representation of the time that we're
[8:25] living in that when in the climax of
[8:28] christianity
[8:29] in the climax of god call in a gentile
[8:32] bride in this time that we're living in
[8:33] now where do we get called out of
[8:35] babylon
[8:37] we have a voice calling us out of
[8:38] laodicea and knock at the door we have a
[8:40] voice calling us out of babylon these
[8:42] are such beautiful types for the time
[8:43] that we're living in now
[8:45] and some of the things that we
[8:47] emphasized on sunday is that satan's
[8:49] power satan the seed of satan's power is
[8:51] represented in the tower of babel
[8:54] and even satan's seat is babylon
[8:56] scripturally and these different things
[8:57] that we could look at but babylon
[8:59] chaldea the tower babel they're all
[9:01] related to this region and this area
[9:04] that god calls abraham out of er the
[9:07] land of the chaldees the plain of shinar
[9:08] it's all the same region that's
[9:10] identified with abraham and his
[9:13] ancestors and so by god leading abraham
[9:16] out of babylon he's foreshadowing what
[9:18] he's going to do to his seat after him
[9:20] and we all said amen because he called
[9:22] us out of babylon he's called us out of
[9:24] sin he's called us out of chaos
[9:26] in acts chapter seven verses two to four
[9:28] now we're just gonna we're continuing on
[9:31] and i feel like i'm just kind of picking
[9:32] up where i could have been on sunday
[9:35] the
[9:36] we've used this scripture a few times
[9:38] before but this is stephen now
[9:40] expressing this
[9:41] and kind of giving the history to these
[9:43] jews are going to soon stone him he said
[9:46] men brethren and fathers hearken the god
[9:47] of glory appeared unto our father
[9:49] abraham when he was in mesopotamia
[9:52] and you probably the only time you'll
[9:54] hear this is in your you know geography
[9:56] class or you know history class or
[9:58] something in school or reading the bible
[10:00] this is a region
[10:02] which means the word means between two
[10:03] rivers and it's the land between the
[10:05] tigris river and the euphrates river and
[10:07] it's a specific area
[10:09] uh that abraham is living in when he's
[10:11] called out it says this is where he was
[10:13] he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in
[10:16] koran so this is uh the city of ur and
[10:19] then it's before he dwelt in quran
[10:21] because he kind of travels and stays in
[10:23] the same region when he goes to quran he
[10:25] says and he said unto him get thee out
[10:27] of thy country and from thy kindred and
[10:29] come into the land which i shall show
[10:31] thee then he came out of the land of the
[10:33] chaldeans and dwelt in korean and from
[10:36] fence when his father was dead he
[10:37] removed him into this land canaan
[10:40] palestine or israel wherein you now
[10:42] dwell
[10:43] and so this region that god is
[10:45] identifying that all israel would know
[10:47] this is where abraham came out of
[10:49] it was in the re it was the plane of
[10:51] shinar that he called him out of it was
[10:53] where the babel tower was built it's
[10:55] where the babylonian kingdom began it's
[10:57] where all these images and all these
[10:59] powers and these things that we
[11:00] represent with satan's agenda that's
[11:02] where it was initiated and that's where
[11:04] abraham was
[11:06] brother bannon made this statement not
[11:07] only was ancestor worship originated in
[11:10] babylon
[11:11] but also
[11:12] the worship of nature originated in
[11:14] babylon it was in babylon the gods were
[11:16] identified with the sun and the moon
[11:19] and there's a statement he makes in the
[11:20] church age book and quran was the home
[11:23] of the mesopotamian
[11:25] moon god
[11:27] you want to know what his name was
[11:29] sin
[11:31] not interesting
[11:32] the moon god was s-i-n it's it's this
[11:35] this would be the the mesopotamian name
[11:37] or the the the dialect that they gave it
[11:40] but to us if we read it it would be
[11:41] s-i-n-sin but it was the home of the
[11:44] moon god and we know that the moon
[11:46] represents in type there's a way that it
[11:48] can be typed as the church
[11:50] but then there's this representation
[11:52] there's a
[11:53] place where the church begins to have
[11:54] preeminence and what is it it's mystery
[11:56] babylon and the church enforces its own
[11:59] agenda and it goes out to conquer and to
[12:01] destroy and and to murder and to kill
[12:03] anyone who disagrees with him so when we
[12:05] see the moon god and we see the moon
[12:07] being worshiped that's not not
[12:10] reflective of the true church but rather
[12:11] it's reflected of the false church or
[12:13] mystery babylon
[12:15] and now as we think about this this is
[12:17] where god god says i called you out of
[12:19] mesopotamia he's there in ur in the city
[12:22] of the chaldees the bible says he goes
[12:24] to karem there were two main seats of
[12:26] worship of the moon god in mesopotamia
[12:29] you want to guess where they were
[12:31] the chief one was in ur
[12:33] and the other one anybody want to guess
[12:34] what the second one was
[12:36] quran place that abraham moved to or
[12:39] quran as it says in acts chapter 7. and
[12:42] so the two main seats of worship was er
[12:44] in the south of mesopotamia and then
[12:46] haran where abraham moved the first time
[12:48] in the north the chief sanctuary at ur
[12:50] was named the house of the great light
[12:53] the sanctuary in the city of haran was
[12:55] named the house of joys
[12:57] just think of the perversion that's
[12:58] mixed up into it think about even how
[13:00] the
[13:01] god describes himself he's descriptive
[13:03] of light and how that the house of joy
[13:05] and these different elements that we
[13:06] would associate with god or christianity
[13:09] or the fruits of the spirit are being
[13:10] embodied within a false worship and
[13:12] represented in beautiful temples and
[13:14] these great sanctuaries and orders of
[13:16] worship but this is what god is calling
[13:18] abraham out of a false image of false
[13:21] worship that may be very very close to
[13:24] the truth even something that could
[13:26] seems to be reflecting the light of the
[13:28] sun but yet loses its place and becomes
[13:31] perverted
[13:32] and these principles are still true
[13:34] today i don't care how
[13:36] how long it's been since you've been a
[13:38] catholic or how long it's been since
[13:39] you've said master how long it's been
[13:41] since you genuflected when you walked
[13:43] across the aisle just passing through a
[13:45] church or or did this you know before
[13:47] you went up to bat whatever it might be
[13:49] there there's still spirits and elements
[13:51] that plague us today to try to make a
[13:54] false image out of church
[13:57] and worship the church
[13:59] and so this moon god cult spread
[14:02] throughout all the regions so that
[14:03] temples
[14:04] are found temples to this moon god are
[14:06] found and all were found in all the
[14:07] large cities in babylon
[14:09] and then brother branham emphasizes this
[14:11] in the churches book and history bears
[14:13] it out and shows it that the mystery
[14:16] babylon and the lies of babylon spread
[14:18] out through all forms of worship in the
[14:20] world today
[14:22] at the core of it is satan's agenda and
[14:25] his i will i will and and it might seem
[14:27] to be christian based or it might seem
[14:29] to be um based upon abraham even with
[14:32] islam and there might be different ways
[14:34] that it seems to be true or it might
[14:36] have something oh it's just kind of a a
[14:38] best way of thinking or with a hinduism
[14:41] or this way a different way and just
[14:42] having peace with with nature and
[14:44] everything
[14:45] and uh
[14:47] it just reminds me of the joke that
[14:49] someone told about what the the hindu or
[14:51] i can't remember who it was that asked
[14:52] for a pizza and how did he wanted to be
[14:54] one he wanted one to be one with
[14:56] everything or something like that but
[14:58] these things have their roots in babylon
[15:01] these they have their roots in demonic
[15:03] worship
[15:04] and so this spreads throughout all the
[15:05] earth now this is identifying
[15:08] what abraham came out of
[15:11] what he was called out of so in genesis
[15:13] chapter 24 verses 1 to 10
[15:16] it says that abraham was old and well
[15:18] stricken in age
[15:19] and the lord had blessed abraham in all
[15:21] things
[15:24] so we're coming to the end of the story
[15:25] of abraham
[15:26] and there's a lot that's covered in here
[15:28] because we realize just a couple
[15:30] chapters before abraham is offering up
[15:31] his son isaac upon an altar his mount
[15:34] mariah experience and it says and
[15:35] abraham sit under his eldest servant of
[15:37] his house that ruled over all that he
[15:39] had
[15:40] put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh
[15:42] so this is a way of make swearing and
[15:45] kind of like uh
[15:47] you know you you shake my hand on it
[15:49] this is a way of uh making him swear
[15:51] like an oath i put your hand on the
[15:53] bible and and take this oath i will make
[15:55] thee swear by the lord the god of heaven
[15:57] and the god of the earth that thou shalt
[15:59] not take a wife unto my son of the
[16:02] daughters of the canaanites among whom i
[16:03] dwell
[16:05] this is just another principle of of the
[16:08] promise and who it pertained to but thou
[16:10] shalt go unto my country into my kindred
[16:13] and take a wife unto my son isaac
[16:16] and notice what he's wanting him to do
[16:18] he's wanting to go back where abraham
[16:20] came from to get a wife for isaac and
[16:23] the servant said unto him pre-adventure
[16:24] the woman will not be willing to follow
[16:26] me unto this land must i needs bring thy
[16:28] son again into the land from whence thou
[16:30] camest and abraham said to him beware
[16:32] that thou
[16:34] bring not my son feather again now
[16:36] notice how adamant that abraham is that
[16:38] my son is not to go there but you're to
[16:41] get his wife out of there
[16:43] the lord god of heaven which took me
[16:45] from my father's house and from the land
[16:46] of my kindred and which spake unto me
[16:48] and that swear unto me saying unto thy
[16:50] seed will i give this land
[16:52] he shall send his angel before thee and
[16:55] thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
[16:57] fence from this place that i'm sending
[16:59] you and the woman will not be willing to
[17:00] follow thee then thou shalt be clear
[17:02] from this my oath only bring not my son
[17:06] thither again
[17:07] notice just how important this is to
[17:09] recognize that there's now there's now
[17:11] being a distinction made to where the
[17:13] promise is and where it takes place and
[17:16] how that though abraham was called out
[17:18] of that and there's still yet a work to
[17:21] be done there he will not go there to
[17:23] identify it vindicate it be caught there
[17:26] i didn't uh or to be associated with it
[17:29] there has to be a calling out of it for
[17:31] it to take place my son's not going to
[17:33] go back there
[17:34] he's not going to enter back into
[17:36] babylon he's not going to enter into
[17:37] that chaos he's not going to enter into
[17:38] that region he's not going to go back
[17:39] i'm not going to risk my son going back
[17:42] into babylon but you go and you get him
[17:44] a wife out of there and the servant put
[17:46] his hand under the thigh of abraham his
[17:47] master and swear to him concerning that
[17:49] matter and the servant took ten camels
[17:52] of his camel ten camels of the camels of
[17:54] his master and departed
[17:56] for all the goods of his master were in
[17:58] his hands and he arose and went to
[18:00] mesopotamia under the city of nehor
[18:03] which is
[18:04] which would be haran
[18:06] that was the city that nehor dwelt so
[18:08] where is he going right back to
[18:10] he's going right back to babylon going
[18:12] right back to the place that abraham was
[18:14] called out of and this is a beautiful
[18:16] type that we're seeing here because it's
[18:18] in the land that god called abraham out
[18:20] of that the servant finds rebecca
[18:23] the very place
[18:25] that abraham is called out of babylon
[18:27] the very place the city of her in the
[18:29] land of the chaldees and the plains of
[18:30] shinar in the place of the tower of
[18:32] babel in the koran one of these chief
[18:34] sites for the worship of the moon god
[18:36] that is where abraham servant finds
[18:39] rebecca who is the wife of abraham's son
[18:42] isaac
[18:44] this is the one that god spoke of i'm
[18:45] going to give you a son and he's going
[18:47] to have it he's going you're going to
[18:48] have a son his name's going to be isaac
[18:49] he's going to be from sarah now he needs
[18:51] to be married and god's going to go
[18:53] right back to the same place send in a
[18:54] servant abraham send a servant right
[18:56] back to the same place to call the bride
[18:57] out of there for isaac now what does
[18:59] this portray and signify to us
[19:02] in galatians chapter 3 verse 16 now to
[19:04] abraham and to his seed were the
[19:06] promises made now this this
[19:09] reference to the promises to me is very
[19:11] uh stood out to me as i was going
[19:13] through these scriptures today the
[19:14] promises were made to abraham and his
[19:16] seed he saith not unto
[19:19] the seeds as of many but as of one
[19:23] and to thy seed which is
[19:26] christ
[19:27] so when we're reading in the and and
[19:29] genesis chapter 12 13 14 15 16 17 and on
[19:32] and on and on in any time he speaks
[19:34] about thy seed and so shall thy seed be
[19:36] we might think oh isaac and we think oh
[19:38] we think jacob and we start thinking
[19:39] about the natural cedar all the seeds
[19:41] like we are royal seed of abraham but
[19:43] he's saying that this promise the
[19:45] promises made to abraham and his seed
[19:49] and paul is saying but this is as of one
[19:51] and it's paul's words that say to thy
[19:54] seed which is christ
[19:56] so though we see a seed come forth from
[20:00] abraham that is identified as the one to
[20:02] whom the promise is going to ultimately
[20:04] come through the seat of abraham is
[20:06] christ
[20:07] so when god
[20:09] calls a bride for isaac he's laid a
[20:12] pattern for the choosing of his own
[20:14] bride
[20:15] this is why it's so important the way
[20:16] that god allowed this to take place this
[20:18] is why the specifics are the way that
[20:19] they are because today we see god
[20:22] calling a bride out of laodicea
[20:25] he's calling a bride out of lao to see
[20:26] it because when you read the church age
[20:28] book there's not one compliment for
[20:30] laodicea
[20:31] not one compliment for laodicea so god
[20:33] is calling a bride out of laodicea what
[20:35] is he calling a bride of out of babylon
[20:37] what is he calling the bride of out of
[20:38] the church
[20:40] he's conor out of the church
[20:42] he makes this statement he's here today
[20:44] taking a bride out of the gentiles for
[20:46] his namesake so it's a bride coming out
[20:48] of the gentiles
[20:50] that was already patterned in the colon
[20:52] of abraham because abraham was called
[20:54] from among all the gentiles
[20:56] gentiles would even just mean people
[20:57] just humanity
[20:59] because at one time before abraham was
[21:01] given the sign of circumcision and then
[21:03] had seed after him that also received
[21:04] the sign of circumcision and they became
[21:06] known as israelites because that's the
[21:08] name that jacob's name was changed into
[21:10] who was the grandson of abraham you
[21:11] following me that's how you get jews
[21:15] so everyone was gentiles when god called
[21:17] one man out of the mass of humanity
[21:19] abraham and elected him so abraham was
[21:21] called out from among the nations which
[21:23] is a type of god calling one woman out
[21:25] of the nations again
[21:27] out of the gentiles
[21:29] and he says god called abraham out of
[21:31] babylon
[21:32] so then god calls his son isaac he calls
[21:35] a bride for his son isaac out of babylon
[21:38] which is a type now you follow just how
[21:40] i know it's very very simple and
[21:42] sometimes we like the amen the things we
[21:44] don't quite understand
[21:45] uh it but if in this i know it's very
[21:48] very simple but catch that god did that
[21:52] not only for isaac because he there was
[21:54] a very purpose a purpose and intent
[21:56] behind getting the bride from his family
[21:59] and there's many things represented in
[22:01] it for abraham and isaac but what does
[22:03] it also do it laid the pattern for what
[22:05] he's fulfilled in this hour
[22:07] so it says in genesis chapter 25 verse
[22:09] 20
[22:10] kind of giving using a scripture just to
[22:12] show that it was brought to pass and
[22:14] isaac was 40 years old when he took
[22:15] rebecca to wife the daughter of bethel
[22:17] the son of the syrian the pat anaram the
[22:21] sister to laban the syrian
[22:23] and this area of syria uh padangnaram
[22:26] which is
[22:27] this is more the region but the city
[22:29] he's from just south of it a little bit
[22:31] i think geographically they say was
[22:32] haren the place where they would have
[22:34] been just south of iran this is the
[22:35] whole area they're referring to so this
[22:37] is the this is what's being identified
[22:39] over and over again uh that rebecca is
[22:42] identified with that abraham is
[22:43] identified with that he's called out of
[22:45] so it's god's pattern of choosing a
[22:47] bride
[22:49] he calls isaac bry isaac's bride out of
[22:51] babylon out of mesopotamia what is it
[22:53] out of confusion
[22:54] the seed of satan the chaos and
[22:57] everything and brother branham says in
[22:59] one place now it's being revealed by the
[23:01] son of god as he comes to call a bride
[23:03] out of that system
[23:04] you begin to recognize it over and over
[23:06] and over again when we see a bride being
[23:08] called out in this hour it's out of
[23:09] chaos out of darkness out of confusion
[23:12] out of systems out of man-made creeds
[23:14] and dogmas and it fits perfect even to
[23:16] the point we say it's godless worship
[23:17] it's the worship of satan they think
[23:19] they're worshiping god but they're
[23:20] worshiping satan why because christ has
[23:22] left that left it right
[23:24] he's already called he's already called
[23:26] out of it abraham's not in there anymore
[23:27] the father's not in there anymore
[23:29] isaac's not in there anymore in order to
[23:31] worship god you've got to come out of it
[23:34] this is the pattern that's being laid in
[23:35] the colon of abraham this is the pattern
[23:37] that's laid out in the supreme faith
[23:39] revealed in abraham calling a bride out
[23:41] of the system
[23:42] makes the statement in the rapture and
[23:44] those of you um
[23:46] who are familiar with the message and as
[23:48] i often do i encourage you to listen to
[23:50] it
[23:50] uh brother
[23:52] wes nygard was kind enough to to provide
[23:55] me with a number of
[23:57] uh micro sd cards to share with you as a
[24:00] church to where all of us will have the
[24:02] message at our disposal on mp3 every
[24:04] single one of us and i'm just trying to
[24:05] find the the best way to hand it out
[24:07] which probably would have just to bring
[24:08] them and hand them out and i apologize
[24:10] if i make it more complicated than it
[24:12] should be but i think it's something
[24:13] that's very precious and a very precious
[24:14] gift that's been extended to us where we
[24:16] can all have the message and i think we
[24:17] should be listening to it and those of
[24:19] you who listen to it will recognize
[24:21] dozens of statements that would be
[24:23] connected into this but in the rapture
[24:24] message he's speaking of jesus he was
[24:26] the word in his day you've seen god
[24:28] reflect
[24:29] god has promised to send us that again
[24:31] in the last days so he's saying that god
[24:33] did something then we see the reflection
[24:35] or the pattern a process god does it
[24:37] again he says he's going to send it to
[24:38] us again in the last days to bring the
[24:40] bride out of that ecclesiastical mess in
[24:43] the only way it can be done
[24:45] so there's a bride in an ecclesiastical
[24:47] mess there's a bride caught up in a lot
[24:48] of man's creeds and ideas and doctrines
[24:50] in the tower of babel in babylon and
[24:52] mystery babylon however you want to
[24:54] recall it
[24:55] organization denomination creeds dogmas
[24:58] politics
[24:59] you name it the bride is caught up in
[25:00] that mess and there's only one way that
[25:02] god could call him out and it's the way
[25:03] that he's done it before
[25:05] and the mess is the voice of the sign he
[25:07] said just like he's doing now going to
[25:09] bring a bride out of a church
[25:12] leaving the remnant of the woman's seed
[25:13] the elected will be brought out of the
[25:15] church the church naturals stay here
[25:17] through the tribulation
[25:19] are you catching this how he's putting
[25:21] this
[25:22] the church natural will stay here
[25:24] through the tribulation the elected
[25:26] sometime is called the chosen the
[25:27] elected the remnant let's watch how he
[25:29] did it then because he never changes his
[25:31] way of doing things god has one way of
[25:33] doing things that's the way he does it
[25:35] and that's the right way always so the
[25:37] one way is the right way
[25:39] so even it may be different it's still
[25:40] right so the one way is the right way
[25:42] but he has one way of doing thing that's
[25:43] the way he does it and that's the right
[25:45] way always so see how he did it in the
[25:47] manner he did it in and then we can get
[25:49] a glimpse of this
[25:51] he's using scriptural examples and
[25:53] recognizing a pattern of god in the life
[25:55] of abraham he's recognized in a pattern
[25:57] of god to the seed of abraham and he
[25:58] said do you not can you recognize the
[26:00] same things happening today to the royal
[26:02] seed of abraham
[26:04] and he's saying that cry he's going to
[26:06] bring a bride out of the church why
[26:08] couldn't he just come into the church
[26:10] and marry her
[26:12] why couldn't he just come into laodicea
[26:15] and reveal himself to everyone why
[26:17] couldn't he just do that no that's not
[26:19] the pattern that had been laid out he
[26:21] says isaac don't you step foot back into
[26:24] babylon but you send a messenger with
[26:26] the voice come out of her and into a
[26:28] wedding come out of her and into a
[26:30] marriage come out of her into a union
[26:32] with jesus christ and when we look into
[26:34] the scripture we find that christ is on
[26:36] the outside of the church
[26:38] he's on the outside he won't return into
[26:41] it but he calls the bride out of it and
[26:44] he reveals himself in her
[26:47] and and if you look if you look at the
[26:48] story of isaac
[26:50] as
[26:51] there's boy i better not get get caught
[26:52] up in this with a pool as hard as it is
[26:55] tonight you guys are really pulling
[26:56] strong
[26:57] when i say hard in a good way right
[26:59] that's just how confusing our language
[27:00] can be man your pool is sick tonight
[27:02] loving it
[27:03] uh there's
[27:05] that isaac the servant goes out to get
[27:08] rebecca beautiful beautiful story he's
[27:10] gonna take rebecca from her father
[27:12] bethel from labe and her brother leave
[27:14] him with the gifts and she's gonna come
[27:16] out of her own choosing and he's
[27:18] carrying her and all he begins to just
[27:20] tell her about this one about this one
[27:23] and then she sees a man walking and
[27:25] coming to her he's in the field at the
[27:27] evening time they've left babylon
[27:29] they've left and he's out in his field
[27:31] and she's and she has is told by the
[27:34] messenger that's your bridegroom that's
[27:36] your isaac and as the bible says as soon
[27:38] as she heard that she left off her camel
[27:40] and she ran to meet her her husband and
[27:43] it says and isaac took her into his
[27:45] mother's tent and was comforted at the
[27:47] passing of his mother and that's where
[27:50] the union took place not in babylon
[27:53] this wasn't a babylonian wedding it
[27:55] wasn't a laodicean wife that he's taking
[27:57] to be it's something he took out of
[27:59] because it's of his choosing it's of of
[28:01] this uh this special union and they
[28:04] that's the pattern that god lays down
[28:07] christ on the outside of the church
[28:10] and he comes and he's coming in to step
[28:12] right into the bride it's a union that
[28:14] takes for the right it's in a special
[28:15] place brings her into that tit where the
[28:17] union takes place it's something it's
[28:19] something separated out of babylon
[28:22] this is a pattern that he's he's wanting
[28:24] to show
[28:28] because jesus
[28:30] the christ of the flesh that we'll come
[28:32] to here in a moment in romans 9 that
[28:34] paul said he won't set foot on earth
[28:36] again in the flesh
[28:38] until the millennium
[28:40] and brother branham warned us one time
[28:42] he spoke of the third coming when he
[28:44] comes with his bride he said that's the
[28:45] coming most people are looking for
[28:47] in other words they've associated all
[28:49] these different promises with the third
[28:50] coming so they're thinking that the
[28:51] second coming is going to be the way the
[28:53] third coming is going to be and they
[28:55] miss it
[28:56] so in genesis chapter 21 verse 12 we're
[28:59] just kind of continuing on here
[29:01] uh but these things are all kind of
[29:02] building together it says and god said
[29:04] unto abraham let it
[29:06] i guess i realize for me this makes
[29:08] perfect sense but i'm going to back up
[29:09] and give you some context
[29:10] genesis chapter 21
[29:12] you still have ishmael
[29:15] that is a teenager he's growing up he's
[29:18] a young man that even we recognize
[29:20] abraham when he was told that isaac
[29:22] would be the seed he's like oh lord let
[29:25] ishmael live before thee and that
[29:26] remarkable when you see the prophet
[29:28] wanting hoping that it could be ishmael
[29:30] but it wasn't ishmael it was isaac and
[29:32] so god is addressing this in this
[29:34] statement he says let it not be grievous
[29:36] in thy sight because of the lad ishmael
[29:38] and because of thy bondwoman hagar in
[29:41] all that sarah hath said unto thee
[29:43] hearken under her voice so go don't let
[29:45] this be grievous to you do what she says
[29:46] for in isaac shall thy seed be called
[29:51] this is these are god's words in isaac
[29:54] notice it's still singular in isaac
[29:56] shall thy seed be called
[29:59] it won't be through ishmael but it's
[30:02] going to be through this line through
[30:04] isaac that these seed which paul said
[30:06] was pertained to one christ if the
[30:08] messiah won't come through the ishmael
[30:10] line it won't come through the hagar
[30:12] line it won't come won't come through
[30:14] this uh this use of a bondwoman that
[30:16] produces a wild child which produces its
[30:18] false false twin a false organization a
[30:21] false idea it's got to come through
[30:23] isaac it'll be through that line that
[30:24] the messiah is going to be birthed forth
[30:27] and so god now this is god showing us
[30:30] he's choosing between abraham's sons
[30:33] because it wasn't just that abraham was
[30:35] married and had one son i mean he
[30:37] there was some these
[30:39] instances that take place in his life to
[30:41] where now you have an ishmael
[30:42] and when god now distinguishes with
[30:45] isaac
[30:46] from ishmael what you have represented
[30:49] is the difference you have in ishmael
[30:50] the portrayal of the natural church
[30:53] that can say well we're of our father
[30:55] abraham
[30:56] but it doesn't come the right way
[30:58] doesn't come according to the promise so
[30:59] you see embodied in this son of abraham
[31:02] ishmael the natural church and i'm not
[31:04] talking about islam i'm talking about
[31:06] the christian church the natural
[31:07] christian church it even represents the
[31:09] protestants and the catholics this
[31:11] natural church that is not of the
[31:13] promise that is not in union with christ
[31:15] that is not the elect and so god now is
[31:17] dividing between church natural and
[31:19] church spiritual when he says in isaac
[31:22] shall thy seed be called
[31:24] so in romans chapter 9 when paul is
[31:26] saying oh i just have this heaviness in
[31:28] my heart you that are after the flesh
[31:30] you are israelites you are my brother
[31:31] and this is the you guys are the ones
[31:33] that the promise was made to
[31:35] and this is who christ came to
[31:37] concerning the flesh
[31:39] it says in verse 6 romans 9 verse 6
[31:42] not as though the word of god hath taken
[31:44] none effect for they are not all israel
[31:47] which are of israel and it's it's
[31:50] he
[31:52] he's going to amplify it but in other
[31:54] words
[31:55] it's expressing this sentiment that the
[31:57] promises were to israel
[31:59] but not everyone who claims to be israel
[32:03] does the promise pertain to
[32:05] or is the true israel that these things
[32:07] pertain to
[32:09] so he says neither because they are of
[32:11] the seed of abraham to make his point
[32:14] neither because they are the seed of
[32:15] abraham are they all they are
[32:18] are
[32:19] are they all children
[32:20] but in isaac shall thy seed be called
[32:24] repeating this the verse the words of
[32:26] god
[32:27] it's in isaac that thy seed shall be
[32:29] called that is they which are the
[32:32] children of the flesh these are not the
[32:35] children of god
[32:36] if it's just the natural if it's just
[32:38] the natural energy the natural things
[32:40] the carnal things the all the things
[32:42] that pertain to the flesh the selfish
[32:44] ambition the pride of men the traditions
[32:46] all the creeds all the dogmas if it's
[32:48] just the man then that's not the church
[32:51] he says but the children or the true
[32:52] church but the children of the promise
[32:55] notice that children of the promise are
[32:58] counted for the seed
[33:01] it creates this special elect group
[33:03] within the lineage of abraham you have
[33:05] abraham then you have his son isaac and
[33:07] then it's going to be coming through the
[33:09] loins of isaac that we have the
[33:11] distinction and the narrowing down of
[33:13] who the promise pertains to who does the
[33:15] promise pertain to the children of the
[33:17] promise they are the seed that are
[33:20] spoken of
[33:22] and this is the word of promise i just
[33:25] love this part thinking about it at this
[33:27] time will i come
[33:29] and sarah shall have a son when it's his
[33:31] promise he's the one that brings it to
[33:32] pass
[33:34] it's so beautiful that uh i'm so glad
[33:36] that god is not ikea
[33:40] right
[33:41] you go pick it up it's up if it's in
[33:43] stock but then you're gonna have to put
[33:44] it together yourself
[33:46] i'm so grateful that if he gives us a
[33:48] gift if he gives us something if we just
[33:49] yield enough he puts it all together for
[33:51] us his use it's his plan his program and
[33:55] so he says i will come and sarah shall
[33:56] have a son and then he says and not only
[33:58] this
[34:00] so the thought continues the promise
[34:02] continues this delineation of abraham
[34:05] isaac and israel now is going to come
[34:07] into view because he says not only this
[34:09] this is part of the word of promise but
[34:11] when rebecca also had conceived by one
[34:14] even by our father isaac
[34:17] now this is where it really gets
[34:18] interesting because you have abraham in
[34:21] two wombs right
[34:23] so you have hagar the bondwoman and you
[34:24] have sarah his wife and god says not
[34:26] hagar's out of the picture it's abraham
[34:28] and sarah and so you kind of separated
[34:30] that one oh okay this makes sense but
[34:32] then you have isaac and rebecca and you
[34:35] have one womb
[34:37] and now this is showing the election as
[34:39] it comes he says for the children being
[34:41] not yet born either having done any good
[34:42] or evil that the purpose of god
[34:44] according to election might stand not of
[34:46] works a bit of him that calleth
[34:48] so he could say and not only this but
[34:50] when rebecca also had conceived by one
[34:51] even by a father isaac it was said unto
[34:54] her the elder shall serve the younger
[34:56] god's choosing god's election as it is
[34:58] written jacob have i loved but esau have
[35:01] i hated
[35:03] so this is now isaac's son jacob is the
[35:06] elected heir of the promise
[35:08] the promise doesn't follow esau
[35:11] it's by election it's by god's choosing
[35:13] it follows it follows jacob and so in
[35:16] this we see this is god's election this
[35:18] is god's pattern we see this process we
[35:20] see him narrowing it down so you have
[35:23] you have
[35:25] abraham and sarah that come out of
[35:27] babylon
[35:28] and then he has a son isaac now isaac
[35:30] needs to be married so he sends
[35:33] he sends his servant back into babylon
[35:36] to get a wife for isaac
[35:38] and then now notice notice what isaac
[35:40] does for jacob this is the elect one in
[35:43] genesis chapter 28 verses one to five
[35:45] and isaac called jacob and blessed him
[35:46] and charged him and said unto him thou
[35:48] shalt not take a wife of the daughters
[35:50] of canaan
[35:51] sound familiar
[35:53] arise go to padangaram
[35:55] go right back to mesopotamia to the
[35:57] house of bethel thy father's house and
[35:59] take thee a wife from fence of the
[36:01] daughters of laban thy mother's brother
[36:03] and god almighty bless thee in and make
[36:06] thee fruitful and multiply that thou
[36:08] mayest be a multitude of people and give
[36:10] thee the blessing of abraham to see and
[36:12] to thy seed with thee that thou mayest
[36:14] inherit the land whereas thou art a
[36:16] stranger which god gave unto abraham and
[36:19] isaac sent away jacob and he went to
[36:21] padanaram under laban the son of bethuel
[36:24] the syrian the brother of rebecca jacob
[36:26] and esau's mother
[36:29] goes right back to the same place
[36:31] and it's there that he finds rachel and
[36:33] leah
[36:35] and it's from those women come the the
[36:37] tribes of israel the sons of israel this
[36:39] is what makes up the jewish nation this
[36:41] is the seed of abraham this is the great
[36:43] name and the great nation that was
[36:45] promised to abraham so when jacob is
[36:47] going to have a wife where does he go to
[36:50] find the wife right back to the same
[36:52] place that rebecca was called out of now
[36:54] just in a very we're doing really great
[36:56] on time so i feel like i just need to
[36:57] bring all everything i just need to come
[36:59] up here with the red volumes remember
[37:00] back in the day when a preacher would
[37:02] jump you judge how long the service was
[37:04] going to be by how many red volumes he
[37:05] brought
[37:06] oh no that's volume 18 that's got like
[37:08] that's like spoken words the original
[37:09] seed in there and who's the smoke and
[37:11] you got all nervous because you thought
[37:12] we're going to be here forever
[37:15] but i should just start bringing my red
[37:16] volumes
[37:17] because there's so much hair
[37:19] if you think about it so remarkable here
[37:21] god's telling
[37:23] isaac is telling jacob go into back into
[37:26] babylon pat anaram go back to the house
[37:28] of laban to get a wife
[37:30] so he now recognizes the attitude of his
[37:32] father don't marry here esau overhears
[37:35] this and recognizes don't marry a woman
[37:37] in canaan but guess where he goes to
[37:38] find a wife from the daughters of
[37:40] ishmael
[37:42] doesn't have the revelation oh oh well
[37:44] we shouldn't marry from here but he
[37:45] still doesn't he can't join himself to
[37:47] the promise so he even makes it worse
[37:49] and it identifies himself in goals to
[37:51] find daughters of ishmael to marry
[37:53] because the promise is by election and
[37:56] now jacob is going to go and find a wife
[37:57] rachel and leah he finds these wives
[38:00] you're going to bring forth these sons
[38:01] of the promised children of the promise
[38:03] that makes the nation of israel and they
[38:05] become a multitude of people this is
[38:07] god's the image that god is portraying
[38:10] in these sons of abraham
[38:12] god is reinforcing the pattern that when
[38:14] i call a wife when i call a bride when i
[38:17] call a son when i call a child of god
[38:19] out i'm calling him out of babylon
[38:22] you may have been born in the message
[38:24] but you still have to be called out of
[38:26] chaos called out of sin there's there's
[38:28] no there may be a privilege and a
[38:29] blessing but there's no royalty
[38:32] and having message parents there's no
[38:34] royalty and being born and raised in the
[38:36] message church the royalty comes from a
[38:38] new birth experience which is to be
[38:40] baptized with the holy ghost and every
[38:42] son of daughter of god must have that
[38:44] experience of being called out of
[38:46] babylon called out of sin
[38:48] and for some of us i i want to be very
[38:51] careful in how i say this but for some
[38:52] of us
[38:53] our greatest barrier to coming to the
[38:55] truth is how we were raised in the
[38:57] message
[38:59] because a false image of a union between
[39:01] an ishmael and an esau presented a wrong
[39:04] message of abraham to us and it became
[39:06] the biggest hindrance to us falling in
[39:08] love with christ
[39:11] god is showing this
[39:13] i'll find my seat and i'll call them out
[39:18] i'm gonna my if i could just kind of
[39:20] back up a little bit because what i want
[39:21] to express again is that god calls his
[39:23] wife he calls her out of babylon
[39:27] abraham took a wife out of there he went
[39:28] got a wife for isaac now jacob
[39:31] these are the ones that stand as the
[39:32] most prominent as the wives of the
[39:33] forefathers all the ones that are buried
[39:35] in hebron
[39:37] all these ones are buried together in
[39:38] hebrew abraham and sarah isaac and
[39:40] rebecca and then jacob with his two
[39:43] wives they're all buried in the same
[39:45] place why because it was expressing
[39:47] something to us right
[39:48] it's telling us something
[39:50] but he's also showing another side to
[39:52] the promise this is just very short
[39:53] thought i
[39:54] realized i daresome to say it but we
[39:56] might be short tonight we might do it i
[39:59] don't know what time i got up here but
[40:00] it's only 803
[40:02] i mean we're doing great on time salad
[40:04] to go it's gonna still be open
[40:06] you got some time to hang out by the
[40:07] fire i mean this our church has got an
[40:09] awesome foyer and patio
[40:12] people talk about how many how how much
[40:14] does your church sit i go i don't know
[40:16] how much it can sit but it sleeps about
[40:17] 180.
[40:21] you know i have our own room
[40:24] and now that i say it you know there's a
[40:26] lot of churches that sleep three hundred
[40:41] but there's another side that he's
[40:42] expressing in this promise
[40:45] this part just blessed me so much this
[40:46] week when i was looking at this
[40:49] abraham has his wife they come out
[40:51] together oh my and that wonderful they
[40:53] came out together
[40:55] isaac needs a wife so god sends a
[40:56] messenger sends a servant now there's a
[40:58] lot of types there you know i'm leaving
[40:59] out and the messenger that goes against
[41:01] isaac and the type of the the how the
[41:03] message comes and finds us and calls
[41:04] this out and it finds that seed it finds
[41:06] that one by election think of it well
[41:08] how am i gonna know and he prays this
[41:10] prayer and he comes and who comes out to
[41:12] the well
[41:14] a daughter of bethel from the very house
[41:16] this is god's way of doing things and we
[41:18] see this but then also when it comes
[41:21] time
[41:22] when it comes time for jacob to have a
[41:24] wife
[41:25] he goes back again to the same place
[41:28] and what struck me is this part of the
[41:30] side of the promise stood out to me that
[41:31] god will call until the last one comes
[41:35] he'll have as many messages into babylon
[41:38] in as many weddings as he needs
[41:40] until the last union takes place
[41:42] he's never going to stop he's never
[41:44] going to give up there's not a seed
[41:45] that's left in babylon now that he's
[41:47] been like all right you know what this
[41:48] has been going on long enough let's wrap
[41:49] this thing up doesn't it doesn't matter
[41:51] if you know it doesn't matter if you
[41:53] left seemingly you're kind of in that
[41:55] wagon train and you made it out of ur
[41:57] into her on you found yourself in canaan
[41:59] like we're here and you decided to go
[42:00] back and you're having a really good
[42:02] time in babylon if you're his seed one
[42:05] day the message is going to find you and
[42:07] be like hey it's time to go get married
[42:10] time to leave this nonsense leave your
[42:11] past behind leave all this other garbage
[42:13] and it's time for you to come back to
[42:15] the truth come back to your promise and
[42:17] so god is going to send as many
[42:20] messengers as he has to into babylon
[42:23] just as he's done through the church
[42:24] ages and just as he's doing now he will
[42:27] send he will preach he will do it until
[42:31] until the last seed hears it why because
[42:34] this is the power of the promise it will
[42:37] not rest until it reaches every child of
[42:40] the promise
[42:43] we should never give up
[42:46] there's a song that goes i've heard it
[42:48] said
[42:48] the gospel is rest
[42:51] oh how i need it
[42:53] say it again
[42:55] until i believe it
[42:56] there's some that need to hear it over
[42:59] and over until all unbelief is broken
[43:01] away until all complexes are driven back
[43:04] until all scars and wounds are placed in
[43:06] their contacts and any wound is healed
[43:08] and say yes lord i relent i give into
[43:11] this this is this is what i was made for
[43:13] it's the power of the promise it will
[43:15] persist
[43:17] the promise will persist until the last
[43:19] one is called out of babylon i say let's
[43:22] not quit as a church until the last one
[43:24] comes out of babylon
[43:28] it says in acts chapter 2
[43:29] we know it be baptized and this great
[43:32] call in verse 38 but now it says for the
[43:34] promise
[43:35] remember the promise the promise only
[43:38] those who are of the promise are counted
[43:40] for the seed and these promises were
[43:42] made and these promises were given and
[43:44] this is this is brings us into view and
[43:46] the promise is unto you
[43:49] i i want to hear some amens and to your
[43:51] children
[43:53] and and all that are far off you say oh
[43:55] they're way gone oh they've backslid far
[43:58] they're way off in false talking oh they
[44:00] fell way far away i'm so glad it says to
[44:03] them that are far off
[44:05] how many even as many as the lord our
[44:07] god shall call
[44:09] we can have a confidence at the same god
[44:11] that called you out rebecca is sitting
[44:13] there fretting and worrying who's going
[44:15] to marry jacob who's going to marry
[44:17] jacob don't worry just as god got you
[44:19] out
[44:20] he'll go and get another bride out for
[44:22] your son and we should not fret the same
[44:25] god that called you out we'll call your
[44:27] seed out
[44:29] we can have a bold faith we don't need
[44:31] to shrink back we don't need to
[44:34] be
[44:34] despondent i could maybe say this
[44:38] i i i say this with reverence and fear
[44:42] sometimes it's our response to unbelief
[44:45] and our response to rebellion and maybe
[44:47] someone seems to get a little shifty and
[44:49] they express some things and say some
[44:50] things and then we get defensive and
[44:52] it's in being defensive in our response
[44:54] it causes more damage than their own
[44:56] doubt
[44:58] and it because it actually becomes a
[44:59] thing that cuts the cord and pushes
[45:01] people away it's been the response of
[45:02] the church that's driven some of our
[45:04] children away not the church not the
[45:06] word not or not the truth not the
[45:07] message it's been the message believers
[45:09] that have done it why because they get
[45:11] scared and they get nervous and they get
[45:13] worried and they can't just relax and
[45:14] say hey i'm standing here by the grace
[45:16] of god god called me out of nonsense and
[45:19] and have this confidence not all god i'd
[45:21] hate to see it but if they've got to go
[45:22] into babylon you found me in babylon and
[45:25] there's no place in babylon you can't
[45:27] reach you'll find them and rest on the
[45:29] fact that we know this is the truth
[45:31] we don't have to fear what men can do
[45:33] but rest in the election rest in grace
[45:41] the same god that called you i will call
[45:43] him out
[45:44] but hello and brother mike if you could
[45:46] come
[45:47] and the message proven his word
[45:50] i was just reading different statements
[45:51] today that related to this
[45:53] the last seed coming in
[46:01] i want you think about it
[46:02] what is it if we just generalized it and
[46:04] summarize it tonight
[46:05] what happens when the last seed comes in
[46:08] it's over right
[46:10] why
[46:12] you ever thought about that
[46:14] well why why why is it all sent over
[46:16] we just got the last seating can we play
[46:18] church for a while
[46:20] can we have some fun with this i mean
[46:21] we're all believers now right
[46:23] it's good it's over
[46:26] now we know in the prophet's language
[46:27] there's things that may seem very
[46:28] literal but yet they could come to pass
[46:30] in a more spiritual sense but there's a
[46:31] wrapping up there's a summation it's
[46:32] done it's finished it's over we know
[46:34] jesus even said to himself that when the
[46:36] when the fruit the seed comes forth and
[46:38] the
[46:39] it's perfectly ripe then immediately the
[46:41] the sickle is thrust forth because the
[46:43] harvest is coming now once it's finished
[46:45] everything's ripe you harvest it
[46:48] why
[46:51] because it's god's finished
[46:54] he's got what he wanted
[46:56] this isn't what he wanted he didn't want
[46:58] church
[47:00] trust me this isn't what he wanted this
[47:02] isn't what he wanted
[47:03] right it's not steeples and beautiful
[47:06] baptistries that's not what he wanted he
[47:09] wanted a bride of his choosing
[47:11] and so when
[47:13] if it just happens with a bunch of
[47:14] people playing church he's like as soon
[47:16] as they're playing church actually a
[47:17] blind squirrel finds a nut and it's the
[47:19] last one he says i'm done because it's
[47:21] never been about the church it's been
[47:23] about his bride
[47:27] he says and so i was reading these
[47:29] statements and this one just kind of
[47:30] struck me very deeply he's praying at
[47:32] the end of proving his word dear god
[47:33] those may i not those may i not see
[47:37] because he said there's people just
[47:38] coming to the altar praying he says that
[47:40] standing they want to accept you
[47:42] they realize lord that this has not been
[47:44] done until this time
[47:46] some of these mad wonderful things that
[47:47] are being brought forth and manifested
[47:49] before the gentiles and now you confirm
[47:51] it and prove that it's so
[47:53] i pray father that in their hearts
[47:56] that's strangely moved at this time
[47:59] then notice he says how do we know but
[48:00] what this is the last person to come in
[48:04] this may be the end for los angeles
[48:07] oh wouldn't it be wonderful one day
[48:10] if we found the end of phoenix
[48:13] if the story written of maricopa valley
[48:15] finally reaches
[48:17] the point
[48:18] what was the point of all the mysteries
[48:19] unfold in a maricopa valley so we could
[48:21] have an awesome church right right let's
[48:23] just all be honest no
[48:25] to get a bride out of it
[48:28] to defeat the mysteries of babylon to
[48:29] defeat the defeat the mysteries of the
[48:31] devil that's getting lifted up and laid
[48:33] to see it that's the purpose he says
[48:35] this may be the end of for los angeles
[48:37] why would it be the end of los angeles
[48:39] it would have been it would have given
[48:40] up its purpose
[48:43] because what's the earth here for
[48:45] to get a bride out of it
[48:47] so when los angeles finally gives up the
[48:49] last seed he's done with her
[48:52] when denver gives up the last seed sorry
[48:54] i don't know why i looked right at you
[48:55] brother and i brought up colorado
[48:57] when it gives it the last seed it's over
[49:00] why because that's what it's here for
[49:03] he says but maybe los angeles give up
[49:04] the last one this may be the last soul
[49:06] that will be born into the kingdom
[49:09] we don't know when that time comes and
[49:10] notice this how beautifully paints the
[49:12] picture when it does the door will be
[49:14] closed why
[49:16] why i want to sing another special
[49:18] i want to have another camp
[49:20] i want to have another october 2022
[49:22] pastor appreciation
[49:24] [Music]
[49:26] the body will be complete
[49:30] it will not be a freak body or a freak
[49:33] bride
[49:35] it'll just have so many members whose
[49:37] names were put on the lamb's book of
[49:38] life before the foundation of the world
[49:39] which jesus came to take like adam walk
[49:42] right out to save his wife
[49:45] oh beautiful beautiful beautiful
[49:49] i'm so glad i was ending there
[49:52] i want to pick up sunday morning on that
[49:53] image
[49:55] the brother branham just painted this
[49:56] picture
[49:58] of how in the end time it's all over why
[50:00] because now he has his complete bride
[50:03] he says we're done
[50:05] goodbye world
[50:07] i stay no longer with you
[50:09] she's out of here he's come away
[50:12] my love he calls her out
[50:15] and ask her just to step right out of
[50:18] even the dead this sinful body that's

[52:11] babylon is any place where your soul
[52:13] exists without a new birth experience

[53:35] with humility in our hearts that you
[53:38] would receive those who stood with a
[53:40] desire
[53:41] to be captured out of babylon
[53:44] anyone that would have the strange move
[53:47] upon their heart this deepness of
[53:48] sincerity to realize lord you're
[53:51] you're doing something in me i haven't
[53:53] felt this before this is beyond any
[53:54] experience and i know this is you and
[53:56] it's real
[53:57] lord i pray that you could now in a
[54:00] deep move of grace
[54:03] in a very profound and
[54:05] uh
[54:06] overt way come and move impose yourself
[54:09] upon that heart
[54:11] that is very fearful of what the future
[54:13] may
[54:14] bring very fearful of their circumstance
[54:16] and how much it may change the lord may
[54:18] there be a spirit of peace that would
[54:19] come upon them to say
[54:21] daughter all is well
[54:23] don't fear i've got it all in control
[54:27] that we maybe trust that you have the
[54:28] what is best for us that you will do
[54:31] those things which are best for us

[54:48] that you would heal them and bind them
[54:49] up
[54:52] lord as a church as we desire to be more
[54:56] faithful to the call
[54:58] to express your attributes in this end
[55:00] time not arrogance not more
[55:03] out of knowledge that puffs up but a
[55:05] real
[55:06] meekness of christ on display
[55:11] to call
[55:14] to call your bride out of laodicea and
[55:15] out of babylon
[55:18] lord may we make it our mission to see
[55:21] that maricopa valley serves its purpose
[55:23] and gives up the last bride member
[55:25] [Music]

[55:31] somehow some way by your grace reach the
[55:33] believers

[55:40] and assist others who are labored in
[55:41] this cause lord
[55:43] for after all it's your bride not ours
[55:46] we're just members of it
[55:51] [Music]
[55:54] lord may you drive out all fear right
[55:56] now
[55:58] it has no place in our dealings with you
[56:00] it has no place in our pondering of the
[56:02] future but may we just give in to you
[56:06] just trust you lord
[56:08] may that be where it begins for those
[56:10] who stand here tonight and
[56:12] our congregation those present
[56:14] may we be reminded if we're accepting
[56:16] you may we be reminded that abraham's
[56:18] life began with accepting a call and he
[56:20] just followed your steps
[56:23] abraham didn't have to do it on his own
[56:25] neither will any of us may we just yield
[56:26] to you i pray
[56:28] have your way in jesus name
[56:31] amen
[56:32] amen praise the lord
[56:34] praise the lord
