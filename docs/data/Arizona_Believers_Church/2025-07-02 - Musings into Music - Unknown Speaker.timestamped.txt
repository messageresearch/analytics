[0:00] Psalms 119, read verse 133. Order my
[0:04] steps in thy word, and let not any
[0:07] iniquity have dominion over me. I'm sure
[0:10] you, most of you have heard this before.
[0:12] We sing a portion of it. Order my steps
[0:16] in thy word, and let not any iniquity
[0:18] have dominion over me. God bless you.
[0:22] You can take your seats.
[0:28] I'm going to give you my title and then
[0:31] uh jump into the thought maybe just
[0:33] giving backgrounding just a little bit
[0:36] uh from Wednesday night. Brother John,
[0:37] did I send a Okay, good. I was starting
[0:39] to think I missed it. But uh my title is
[0:42] musings into music. And so I got
[0:46] everybody's attention. This is perfect.
[0:48] But it's musings into music. I'm going
[0:50] just give you my thesis statement
[0:52] something at the outset kind of the way
[0:54] that it just formed in my heart and been
[0:55] forming is and kind of carrying on from
[0:58] where we were on Sunday. But this is
[1:00] about thoughts that we have in our mind
[1:03] and things that we uh we think about as
[1:05] we're looking at how we spend our time.
[1:07] But thoughts become an orderly uh even
[1:10] timely and in doing so it produces a
[1:12] pleasing rhythm and melody and something
[1:15] that in the product it's harmonious.
[1:17] It's something that is pleasing and
[1:19] satisfying. We looked at how that
[1:21] character is virtue in action. It's your
[1:24] convictions. It's your integrity when it
[1:26] acts. And as a man thinks and as a man
[1:29] is in his character, it determines his
[1:31] behavior. So, I'm just kind of using a
[1:33] little bit of a phrase musings into
[1:35] music to show some sort of process kind
[1:38] of moving from one thing into another.
[1:41] And that's uh and that I think that'll
[1:43] become a little bit more clear as we go
[1:45] forward tonight. Now Sunday we spoke on
[1:47] wasteland and we were looking at
[1:49] uncultivated or desolate soil or ground
[1:52] and in that I would say that the ground
[1:55] itself or the earth is something that's
[1:57] not necessarily barren in and of itself
[2:00] but there's an uncultivated promise.
[2:02] There's a missed potential. We could
[2:04] look at uh they they send uh spacecraft
[2:07] to Mars and they've gone to the moon and
[2:09] they're trying to find some life, some
[2:11] potential to sustain life and they say,
[2:13] "Well, those things are just a wasteland
[2:15] because there's no water, there's no
[2:17] oxygen." But I would say that the
[2:19] wasteland I'm thinking about is where
[2:21] there was potential. There was an
[2:23] opportunity, but it's missed. And we use
[2:26] the term to cultivate, prepare, or to
[2:29] even develop the quality of something or
[2:31] develop a skill. We used cultivate
[2:34] something that is cultivated as the
[2:36] opposite of a wasteland. I imagine no
[2:38] matter how much you cultivate Mars, you
[2:40] might not be able to get anything out of
[2:41] it. So the wasteland isn't necessarily
[2:44] uh the beginning and the end and there's
[2:46] no hope for it. But we who have
[2:48] opportunity, we who are earth oursel are
[2:51] we cultivating so that we're fulfilling
[2:53] God's promise for us. And one theme that
[2:58] I'm holding in my heart as I study these
[3:00] things as we introduced on Sunday is
[3:02] this context of time and what is being
[3:05] done in our time to refine to encourage
[3:07] or stimulate our spiritual hearts our
[3:10] minds and and our in our character and
[3:12] we were looking if I could put it this
[3:14] way if we exclusively use our time
[3:16] because some of the questions that come
[3:17] up is well is there any place for
[3:19] leisure can I do anything where I just
[3:21] let my mind uh shut down and I don't
[3:23] have to concentrate or think
[3:25] And I think there's a place for leisure.
[3:27] There's a place for getting away and
[3:28] resting. But if we exclusively use our
[3:30] time in a way that does not enrich our
[3:33] character, then it's it's utterly a
[3:35] waste. That there's there's no hope for
[3:37] us to really cultivate the right kind of
[3:39] attributes. You may become skilled in
[3:42] something, but if you are never using
[3:44] your time at any point to cultivate
[3:46] character, then there's going to be a
[3:48] you're wasteful about the opportunity.
[3:51] And we were reading in Ephesians chapter
[3:53] 5, redeeming the time because the days
[3:55] are evil. We used a little bit of a
[3:56] portion there that we'll revisit. And
[3:59] waste was at the center of Paul's
[4:01] thought when he's talking about how that
[4:03] we ought to live and how that we ought
[4:04] to grow. And redeeming the time was
[4:06] about using opportunity for growth and
[4:09] and and and to using our power to grow.
[4:13] And so I'm wanting to use the concept of
[4:16] time and timing as we mentioned Sunday
[4:19] and how that we
[4:21] are creatures of time. So we're subject
[4:23] to it so that and and how that we ought
[4:25] to master it, how that we ought to use
[4:27] our time. The statement just to end our
[4:30] summary on the great sin of most of the
[4:32] stories of popular culture. This is the
[4:34] professor from Bethl College in
[4:36] Minnesota. The great sin of most of the
[4:38] stories of popular culture in films,
[4:41] television, novels, and the like is not
[4:44] that they are violent or obscene or
[4:46] godless, but they waste our time. I
[4:50] think this is just so uh um important to
[4:53] think about that sometimes we think,
[4:55] well, I I want to have something that
[4:57] doesn't have the adultery in it. I want
[4:58] something that doesn't have the
[4:59] fornication or the the the the the
[5:02] language. and we try to filter out
[5:04] certain horror scenes and things. And
[5:06] well, it's not just that it's ungodly or
[5:08] wicked or obscene or violent, but
[5:11] sometimes it's just the fact that it's
[5:13] absolutely a waste of time. We might use
[5:15] the phrase veging out. And so it begs
[5:18] the question, is that what veggie tales
[5:20] is all about is veging out? But you
[5:23] could say even with Veggie Tales, you
[5:24] can find there's a moral purpose. I find
[5:27] that with adventures in Odyssey, there
[5:29] can be some really interesting
[5:30] narratives and stories and a lot of
[5:32] attitudes and things that are said and
[5:34] but there's they usually end it with a
[5:36] scripture and something where the
[5:38] narrator comes back on and it's going to
[5:40] teach you a principle and it's going to
[5:41] kind of buy that time. you just spent 30
[5:43] minutes listening to a drama and
[5:45] different voices and now they're going
[5:46] to give you the spiritual principle and
[5:48] what I've noticed kids do is they just
[5:49] skip to the next episode and they don't
[5:51] bother with the part that would actually
[5:53] take what they heard and cultivate their
[5:56] mind by it. So the biggest sin or the
[5:59] greatest sin as this one uh you know
[6:02] concludes and I think it's up to you to
[6:04] whether or not you want to agree with
[6:05] this but I think it's good just to get
[6:06] us to think that the waste of our time
[6:08] is the greatest sin of a lot of the
[6:10] popular fiction and the stories film
[6:12] television novels and the like that we
[6:14] feed on. Now to my title tonight musings
[6:18] into music. So the term muse how many
[6:21] have ever heard that before muse. You've
[6:23] heard that before. I realize I didn't
[6:24] send the fonts but since muse and music
[6:28] uh both terms have the same Greek origin
[6:31] same Greek word is what it begins from
[6:33] and even the muse is the goddess of art
[6:36] and song and both of these words come
[6:38] from the root the Greek root to think
[6:41] and so there's this connection in uh
[6:44] these words muse and music you can see
[6:46] that they have some sort of structure
[6:48] together as you observe it they come
[6:50] from that Greek word muso uh and both of
[6:53] them together share this common root to
[6:55] think. So it has something to do with
[6:56] it's in the mind of a man. Uh ancient
[6:59] Greek poems were songs that were
[7:02] performed to musical accompaniment. They
[7:04] weren't just uh poetry, just words, but
[7:06] there's usually music included with it.
[7:08] So there was a blend of melody and
[7:10] rhythm and words. So to muse or to write
[7:12] poetry often assumed the uh the the use
[7:17] of music. So muse as a verb to muse it
[7:20] means to ponder to dream to loiter and
[7:23] therefore some have concluded and it's
[7:25] used kind of in this sense to waste time
[7:28] comes from actually in the French amuser
[7:30] was one in the 14th century a muser was
[7:33] one who just seemed to really just be
[7:35] stuck in the clouds and always thinking
[7:37] and and even the word has some origin in
[7:40] some languages to their nose being up in
[7:42] the air just lost in thought and so it
[7:44] means to loiter to ponder or to waste
[7:48] time kind of caught in your thoughts.
[7:50] Whereas music, and I'm just looking at
[7:52] this solely from our our dictionary
[7:55] sense, not necessarily the biblical
[7:57] sense, but the word music, the noun
[7:59] actually means the art of the muses. And
[8:02] if you look at the French, you look at
[8:04] the Latin, all of them are coming from
[8:06] this Greek word music. And and musica
[8:09] and music, they all speak of the same
[8:11] thing. It comes from that Greek word,
[8:13] the art of the muses. Now, this is where
[8:16] I'm just going to change it just a
[8:18] little bit or or get into the
[8:20] differences. Though musing and music uh
[8:23] share some common origin in history,
[8:25] there is a difference. There's a
[8:27] difference between one musing or music.
[8:31] Musing we could even find in the
[8:32] scripture. Musing is to reflect, to
[8:35] ponder, to meditate, to be absorbed in
[8:38] thought. In Psalms 4:4,
[8:42] that's that's right. I forgot. I wanted
[8:43] to take a poll. If it's just one verse,
[8:46] do you say Psalm or do you say Psalms?
[8:48] So, is it Psalms 4:4 or would you say
[8:51] Psalm 44? All right. How many in favor
[8:54] of the plural? Raise your hand. Psalms.
[8:57] Okay. How many in favor of the singular?
[9:00] Okay. Well, I'm going to try my best to
[9:02] add the s from now on. I noticed today I
[9:04] was like, hey, sometimes sometimes I do
[9:06] Psalm if it's one, but I was like, if I
[9:08] miss it, because some Bibles do it
[9:10] differently and other people do it
[9:11] differently, but we want to be unified.
[9:14] Right? We want to be all on the same
[9:16] page. And so from now on, if you don't
[9:18] add the S, you might be serpent seed.
[9:24] Psalms 4:4, it says, "Stand in awe and
[9:27] sin not. Commune with your own heart
[9:30] upon your bed and be still."
[9:35] And this phrase here, I'm sure some of
[9:37] you have heard it before. Commune with
[9:38] your own heart upon your bed. There's a
[9:41] lot that's said here in this picture, in
[9:43] this image, commune with your own heart
[9:46] upon your bed. Now, this is not
[9:48] advocating for sleeping in, but rather
[9:50] it's speaking of how finding time to
[9:53] meditate on your own actions that you
[9:55] ought to give serious consideration to
[9:58] your thought processes and how you
[9:59] respond to things and and your asking
[10:02] probing questions even of yourself. You
[10:04] commune with your own heart upon your
[10:07] bed. calmly consider those things in
[10:10] that silent time of the evening or in
[10:12] the night when you can be at leisure
[10:15] when business isn't being demanded upon
[10:17] you when there's things that aren't due.
[10:18] So it speaks of that quiet time when the
[10:21] busyiness of the day has passed and
[10:23] you're upon your bed. So the next thing
[10:25] may be sleep that you ought to take time
[10:27] to kind of be restful and when you have
[10:29] distance from all this distracting
[10:31] demands and busyness that you consider
[10:34] things in that solitude. And it says,
[10:37] "Be still.
[10:39] Compose your tumultuous mind." That
[10:42] there's a a quiet your chaotic thoughts.
[10:45] There's a quieting down. I know some
[10:48] have I or I've I've heard this phrase
[10:50] before and they say, "I can't turn my
[10:52] thoughts off. I can't I can't stop them.
[10:54] It's constantly thinking." Then what you
[10:56] do is you want to begin to compose those
[10:58] thoughts. You want to begin to be very
[11:00] deliberate about the thoughts coming in
[11:01] your head and and approach it to where I
[11:03] want I want to quiet myself down. I
[11:05] don't want to get myself ramped up. I
[11:07] want to quiet myself down. There's a lot
[11:10] of things that they suggest anymore. If
[11:11] you're going to get real good quality
[11:13] sleep, don't have your cell phone in the
[11:14] same room that you sleep in. That means
[11:16] none of you should be sleeping in here
[11:17] tonight. None of you. And so, don't
[11:20] sleep in the room with your devices and
[11:22] don't be on screens at least an hour
[11:24] before you go to bed. And just because
[11:25] you use blue blocker glasses probably
[11:27] isn't going to change anything. There's
[11:28] just a way where the mind is being
[11:30] stimulated and there's a certain way
[11:31] that you're uh uh uh engaging certain
[11:36] functions in the brain and there's it's
[11:38] all so that you can go to sleep. Well,
[11:39] here's a really good scriptural
[11:41] principle of meditating and communion in
[11:44] your heart before you go to bed and be
[11:46] still. Compose those thoughts. Quiet
[11:48] down the chaotic thoughts. Try to try to
[11:51] arrange them.
[11:53] May be quite an ask to do that. But in
[11:56] Psalm 63, Psalms 63:6
[12:00] says, "When I remember thee upon my bed
[12:02] and meditate on thee in the night
[12:05] watches," meditate there could have been
[12:07] translated to muse. It means to devise,
[12:09] to imagine, plot, one of the uh even in
[12:13] the Hebrew it would it would have that
[12:14] meaning of kind of musing, to think
[12:16] about something. So, it even shows again
[12:19] that the evening is appropriate time to
[12:21] uh turn our reflection to the things of
[12:23] God that as the day winds down and
[12:25] you're not having to respond to emails
[12:27] and you're not having to respond to text
[12:29] messages and you've muted the family
[12:30] chat and everyone goes to bed and you're
[12:33] sitting there and you're getting ready
[12:34] to go to sleep or turn your thoughts
[12:36] towards bed. It says that's the time
[12:38] that then be very deliberate about
[12:40] turning your attention to the things of
[12:42] God. Look inside your own heart. What
[12:44] did I do today? Where did I go wrong?
[12:45] What's happened? what what what's the
[12:47] things that I can improve on tomorrow?
[12:49] You're communing within your own heart
[12:50] upon your bed and then you meditate not
[12:53] just upon your own things but on him in
[12:56] the night watches. So musing has and
[13:00] even in our own natural language this
[13:02] raw unbounded thought. It's all in your
[13:04] head and it even if it means a daydream
[13:07] or just deep reflection.
[13:09] And so as it's been the the one way to
[13:12] say is the historical side effect of
[13:15] saying to muse is that one could be
[13:19] lingering too long in their thoughts.
[13:22] And that's why you have that uh
[13:23] pjorative meaning or that negative
[13:25] meaning of to waste time. That you just
[13:27] get lost in your thoughts. It's not
[13:29] productive. And you say you're
[13:30] overthinking it. You think too much. You
[13:32] just need to stop thinking. And for
[13:34] someone who thinks too much, if you tell
[13:36] them they think too much, they're going
[13:37] to begin to think about how they think
[13:40] too much. Yes. Because that just saying,
[13:43] "Hey, just stop thinking." They're going
[13:44] to start thinking about how do you stop
[13:46] thinking? I really need to think about
[13:48] how to stop thinking. And there's a way
[13:51] that it's it's really not going to help
[13:53] just to put it in that way. But there so
[13:55] there is this kind of negative side of
[13:59] musing to where you're wasting your
[14:00] time. But yet we see here was commune
[14:02] with your heart. Meditate on the things
[14:04] of God. So in Psalms 2:1
[14:09] says, "Why do the heathen rage and the
[14:12] people imagine a vain thing?" The rage
[14:16] here means a tumult, a commotion. uh
[14:19] even means to conspire and to plot. So
[14:22] there's some raging if there's a a a
[14:26] conspiracy or a plot even legally. In
[14:28] order for there to be conspiracy, a
[14:30] legal conspiracy, there has to be a
[14:32] meeting of the mind. So there's some
[14:33] thought process or intent here. But why
[14:36] do the heathen rage and why do people
[14:39] imagine a vain thing? That word their
[14:41] imagine imagine is translated to muse in
[14:44] the Hebrew. So why do the heathen rage
[14:48] and conspire and plot and there's such a
[14:50] tumult and and commotion and chaos? It's
[14:52] because they muse vanity.
[14:55] They're musing. They're indicting.
[14:57] They're thinking about. They're
[14:58] pondering vain empty things.
[15:01] In Psalms 38:12, they also that seek
[15:04] after my life lay snares for me. And
[15:06] they that seek my hurt speak mischievous
[15:09] things and imagine deceits all the day
[15:13] long. Imagine. It's musing. It's
[15:15] thinking about there's and and we see
[15:18] enough anymore in uh popular culture or
[15:22] popular fiction and through uh
[15:24] entertainment and media to we don't have
[15:26] to imagine. We just have to remember
[15:28] because there's so many images and so
[15:30] many things that can be done. Now we can
[15:32] take what's in our imagination if we
[15:33] could form the words we can ask uh uh AI
[15:36] to go ahead and produce the video or the
[15:38] image force with that's exactly what I
[15:39] was thinking about that. It right that
[15:41] right there with 12 fingers and all.
[15:45] And then in Proverbs chapter 24 verse 2,
[15:48] again this imagine is musing.
[15:51] And then here in Proverbs chapter 24
[15:54] verse two, should it be proverb 24? No.
[15:58] Verse two. No. Okay. Then Psalms is
[16:00] plural.
[16:01] Or wait, they're all plural. That's
[16:04] where we're going to be. All right.
[16:05] They're all plural. It says, "For their
[16:08] heart studyth destruction."
[16:11] This is your again, this is your musing.
[16:14] Their heart studyth destruction and
[16:16] their lips talk of mischief. They ponder
[16:20] havoc. What they're musing is ruin and
[16:23] devastation. What they what's in their
[16:25] mind is eventually chaos. And it says,
[16:27] "And their lips talk mischief." Why?
[16:30] Because they're musing destruction.
[16:32] Because they're pondering and thinking
[16:34] about the wrong things. Their lips are
[16:35] going to speak the wrong things. And so
[16:38] this heart that studies destruction,
[16:40] this chaos, this havoc, this ruin, such
[16:43] as the wasteland of disorderly musing,
[16:47] this is the product or the waste from
[16:50] thoughts that are disjointed and h and
[16:52] just concordant and all over the place.
[16:55] But music on the other hand, music on
[16:58] the other hand is sound that's crafted
[17:00] in time
[17:02] where there's melody, there's harmony,
[17:04] there's rhythm in a in a very deliberate
[17:06] form.
[17:10] Music is itself the art of combining
[17:13] notes to make melody, harmony and
[17:15] rhythm. In the Latin, muska is the art
[17:18] of music. It would also include poetry.
[17:21] So the word itself is this art. Art,
[17:24] it's an art form. Music combines
[17:26] creativity, emotion, technique into an
[17:30] organized and a composed sonic
[17:32] experience. There's musings that might
[17:35] have some uh connection with music and
[17:38] there's thoughts and there's poetry and
[17:40] there's words, but we're talking about
[17:42] something that's orderly that that's
[17:45] organized.
[17:47] Music is organized sound that's meant to
[17:49] convey meaning or to evoke feeling. And
[17:52] and therefore, music in its pure form
[17:54] engages both the creator, the performer,
[17:57] and the listener, the audience.
[18:01] in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 7 and 8.
[18:07] Listen, everybody just needs to relax. I
[18:08] was kidding about the serpent seed. All
[18:10] right, I was just joking. I feel like I
[18:13] lost everybody in that moment. We can
[18:15] say Psalms, Psalm, Palm, Job, however
[18:18] you want to say it. Just know where
[18:20] you're getting it from. In 1 Corinthians
[18:22] chapter 14 7 and 8, I know that this is
[18:26] a scripture we use quite a bit. It's one
[18:28] I think that's familiar to us. But think
[18:30] about it in this context of this
[18:32] combination of things that produces it's
[18:35] a deliberate arrangement and even things
[18:38] without lifegiving sound whether pipe or
[18:40] harp. So he's specifically talking about
[18:42] musical instruments. Except they give a
[18:45] distinction in the sounds how shall it
[18:47] be know what is piped or harp? For if
[18:50] the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who
[18:52] shall prepare prepare himself to battle?
[18:55] So music cannot be made without be there
[18:59] being a distinction in sounds but an
[19:02] agreement among those different sounds.
[19:05] Says how do we know if something gives a
[19:07] sound whether pipe or harp except they
[19:09] give a distinction
[19:11] uh in in their sounds. So there must be
[19:14] distinction. There must be differences
[19:16] but there has to be some sort of
[19:18] agreement to produce that melody and
[19:19] harmony. So it's not just all over the
[19:21] place and just a noise in order to know
[19:23] what to do.
[19:25] A trumpet given an uncertain sound does
[19:27] not prepare the one who hears it. So
[19:30] without the proper use of notes and
[19:32] distinction in tone, there's no music.
[19:35] He said it when making music, whether
[19:38] pipe or harp, except there be a
[19:39] distinction,
[19:41] except there be some difference,
[19:44] there's no music, there's no tune. It's
[19:46] just frenzy, just a noise.
[19:50] And I know the Bible says make a joyful
[19:52] noise. I've had some friends say that
[19:54] they're very happy it says noise because
[19:56] that's all they're able to do. But a
[19:58] joyful noise is a breaking forth of
[20:00] praise in the Bible. It's a breaking
[20:03] forth of praise. Psalms 98 verses 4-9.
[20:06] It's something that breaks forth, but it
[20:08] has a definite origin. And it has a
[20:10] specific purpose, an intended object.
[20:13] It's not just noise. It's not just
[20:15] laughing. What are you laughing about?
[20:16] Oh, nothing. But it's a it's a breaking
[20:19] forth. In Psalms 98:es 4-9, make a
[20:22] joyful noise unto the Lord, all the
[20:25] earth. Make a loud noise and rejoice and
[20:28] sing praise. Sing unto the Lord with the
[20:31] harp, with the harp and the voice of a
[20:33] psalm, with trumpets and the sound of a
[20:35] cornet. Make a joyful noise before the
[20:38] Lord the King. This is what uh this is a
[20:42] commandment to use the instruments to
[20:44] clap your hands, to raise your voice.
[20:46] Let there be a breaking forth of praise
[20:48] and singing a and psalms to the Lord.
[20:52] And then it equates it with nature. Let
[20:54] the sea roar and the fullness thereof,
[20:55] the world and they that dwell therein.
[20:57] Let the floods clap their hands. Let the
[20:59] hills be joyful together before the
[21:02] Lord. For he cometh to judge the earth
[21:04] with righteousness shall he judge the
[21:05] world and the people with equity. So
[21:09] there is a definite origin of the noise.
[21:12] There's a definite origin of the praise
[21:14] and the sound. In giving sound, there
[21:17] must be distinction. There must be
[21:19] harmony. There must be arrangement. And
[21:21] and it must be something that works
[21:23] together with the other sounds in order
[21:25] for it to form what we would call music.
[21:28] If you've ever heard a a child
[21:32] put their fingers on a piano keyboard
[21:35] and they bang around on it, those are
[21:37] chords, but it's not music. I mean, even
[21:39] with the weight and the and the and the
[21:41] way that they can play, you're like,
[21:42] "Ah, that that that's not music." But to
[21:44] them, they're going and it sounds neat
[21:47] to them. But we understand how there can
[21:49] be sounds, but not music, right? Music
[21:52] has a certain shape to it. It has an
[21:55] arrangement, an architecture that makes
[21:57] it different from just noise.
[22:00] In Genesis chapter 1, when the world was
[22:02] without form and void, and the spirit of
[22:04] the Lord began to move upon the face of
[22:06] the waters in verse two, it has a
[22:08] musical tone to it with form and void
[22:12] becoming ordered, orderly and arranged
[22:14] by God and light begins to shine and
[22:17] things begin to take shape and form
[22:19] maybe in a musical sense. It was
[22:21] chaotic. It was snapping and sounds and
[22:23] a roar and everything was just chaotic.
[22:25] But then as the spirit of the Lord
[22:26] begins to move, there's a quieting down
[22:28] and there's a harmony between the sounds
[22:30] and among the different voices.
[22:33] Recently we use this and maybe sometime
[22:35] last year in Acts chapter 2 when the
[22:38] Holy Spirit fell on the day of Pentecost
[22:40] in verse two of chapter 2, but in verse
[22:41] one it says, "And when the day of
[22:43] Pentecost was fully come, they were all
[22:45] with one accord in one place." that with
[22:49] one accord that homothumadon in the
[22:51] Greek it means to be with this with one
[22:54] mind with one passion and the Greek word
[22:57] to rush along to be uh uh uh to be
[23:00] passionate uh in unity it's a unified
[23:03] passion it's almost a paradox if
[23:05] someone's very passionate and energetic
[23:07] it's energy that's uh synchronized
[23:10] they're they're working together a
[23:12] unified passion and even the word as you
[23:14] read in the lexicon creates a m musical
[23:16] image of a symphony though it has
[23:18] different notes notes played by
[23:20] different instruments. They harmonize
[23:22] and pitch and tone and they're all in
[23:23] the same meter. They're all on the same
[23:25] the same rhythm and it produces
[23:27] something beautiful that even when you
[23:29] could have that many people playing that
[23:32] many instruments and different
[23:33] instruments, even the same instruments
[23:35] playing different things, it's not noise
[23:37] despite their diversity, despite the
[23:40] notes and the tones and the parts.
[23:43] And if we look into the word of God, I
[23:46] know I'm going very quickly this
[23:48] evening,
[23:50] but if we look in the word of God,
[23:51] you'll see that the absence of music is
[23:53] indicative of a wasteland.
[23:56] There's uh it's wasted energy or that
[23:59] uncultivated potential.
[24:02] in Lamentations 5:es 12-16
[24:07] if
[24:09] I guess I didn't really maybe I didn't
[24:10] mention this on Sunday or now but in the
[24:12] looking at timing one of the themes has
[24:14] been music to me from the message of the
[24:16] hour brother Brandham the way he
[24:18] addressed uh the time that we're living
[24:20] in right now he uses music to get us to
[24:22] understand what's taking place so that's
[24:24] where my inspiration is coming from in
[24:27] Lamentations 5 12-16 princes were hung
[24:30] by their hands elders were mistreated.
[24:33] The young men perform menial labor. Boys
[24:35] stagger from their labor. This does not
[24:37] seem right. This is this is uh this is
[24:41] not correct. The elders are gone from
[24:43] the city gate where they would have used
[24:44] their wisdom to exercise judgment and
[24:46] judge amongst the people. Uh the gate is
[24:49] now empty. It says, "And the young men
[24:50] have stopped playing their music." And
[24:54] this isn't, you know, get off my lawn,
[24:56] turn that music down kind of stuff. This
[24:58] is a something that would have been
[24:59] pleasing, something that would have been
[25:00] indicative of a thriving uh uh a
[25:03] flourishing life and a flourishing city.
[25:05] The elders are no longer judging in the
[25:07] gate. The young men have stopped playing
[25:08] their music. Our hearts no longer have
[25:11] any joy. Our dancing is turned to
[25:13] mourning. The crown has fallen from our
[25:15] head. Woe to us for we have sinned. This
[25:19] lamentation indicates that when there's
[25:22] sin and there's uh those that would
[25:24] judge and those that would have wisdom
[25:25] as it begins to pervade one thing that
[25:28] is lost is music stops playing.
[25:32] It's indicative of a wasteland. Jeremiah
[25:35] 7:34 then will I cause to cease from the
[25:38] cities of Judah and from the streets of
[25:40] Jerusalem. So it's prophesied that this
[25:42] would happen. the streets of Jerusalem,
[25:44] the voice of mirth. That voice means the
[25:46] sound or the noise of an instrument,
[25:49] the voice of mirth and the voice of
[25:51] gladness, the voice of the bridegroom
[25:53] and the voice of the bride. For the land
[25:56] shall be desolate.
[25:58] The Bible speaks of with one voice
[26:00] together they shall sing.
[26:03] The voice here would just be maybe
[26:05] shouting or murmuring or whispering, but
[26:06] it even includes this idea that there
[26:08] would be a musical note. There would be
[26:11] a mirthth, a voice of mirth, the sound
[26:14] of an instrument, the voice of gladness,
[26:16] the the music of gladness, the music of
[26:18] the bridegroom, the music of the bride.
[26:20] But in the absence of that, the land is
[26:23] going to be a wasteland. Amen. The very
[26:27] things prophesied here in Jeremiah and
[26:29] lamented about in Lamentations and
[26:31] there's a several other verses in
[26:33] Jeremiah that we could read almost in
[26:36] the exact way is exactly what happens to
[26:39] this the church Babylon
[26:42] in Revelations 18 verses 21 22 and 23.
[26:47] And a mighty angel took up a stone like
[26:49] a great millstone and cast it into the
[26:51] sea, saying, "Thus with violence shall
[26:54] that great city Babylon be thrown down,
[26:56] and shall be found no more at all. And
[26:59] the voice of harpers and musicians and
[27:01] the pipers and trumpeters shall be heard
[27:04] no more at any time, no more at all in
[27:07] thee." Now, we all know people with the
[27:11] last name Harper or we know Pipers and
[27:13] we know Trump's.
[27:16] I think there's something here. And the
[27:18] voice of the harpers and musicians and
[27:20] of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard
[27:22] no more at all in thee. And no craftsman
[27:24] or whatsoever craft he be shall be found
[27:26] anymore in thee. And the sound of a
[27:28] millstone shall be heard no more at all
[27:30] in thee. Notice just that how synonymous
[27:32] it is with the the the absence of life
[27:36] in lamentations in Jeremiah. And the
[27:38] light of a candle shall shine no more at
[27:40] all in thee. And the voice of the
[27:42] bridegroom and of the bride shall be
[27:44] heard no more at all envy. For thy
[27:46] merchants were the great men of the
[27:47] earth. For by thy sorceries were all
[27:49] nations deceived. Judgment upon Babylon.
[27:53] And this complete complete judgment upon
[27:56] Babylon. In its desolation and its
[27:58] wickedness is described in the absence
[28:01] of harpers, musicians, pipers, and
[28:04] trumpeters. They're no more heard at
[28:07] all. Why? Because where there's no
[28:10] music, it's a wasteland. It's desolate.
[28:14] Now, in Ephesians chapter 5,
[28:17] let's read verses 14 to 19. Maybe not uh
[28:21] the whole thing there, but we just kind
[28:24] of cut it a little bit short. It says,
[28:25] "Wherefore he saith, now remember Sunday
[28:27] where we were on this, awake thou that
[28:29] sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
[28:31] Christ shall give thee light. Arise,
[28:33] shine, for thy light has come. gross
[28:35] darkness upon the people, but the glory
[28:37] of the Lord is risen upon thee and shall
[28:39] be seen in thee. There's going to be a
[28:40] light shining from you. Just as the
[28:43] candle is removed from the of Babylon,
[28:45] light is going to be shining in you. The
[28:48] light of God, let there be light,
[28:50] shines, and things begin to take shape
[28:52] in Genesis chapter 1. So, awake you that
[28:55] sleeps, arise from the dead, and Christ
[28:56] shall give thee light. We saw in Isaiah
[28:59] how it did have a uh the timing uh uh to
[29:02] it and the music to it, the singing and
[29:04] the joy. See then that you walk
[29:06] circumspectly, not as fools, but as
[29:08] wise, redeeming the time, because the
[29:10] days are evil. Wherefore being not
[29:13] unwise, but understanding what the will
[29:15] of the Lord is. And be not drunk with
[29:17] wine, wherein is excess, but be filled
[29:20] with the spirit. There's fruitfulness
[29:21] versus wastefulness.
[29:23] Then notice this. Speaking to yourselves
[29:26] in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[29:29] singing and making melody in your heart
[29:31] to the Lord. speaking. That's to utter
[29:34] articulate words, articulate sounds to
[29:37] one another. So when it says speaking to
[29:39] yourselves, it's not talking to
[29:41] yourself. It's talking to one another.
[29:44] Speaking to one another in sounds that
[29:46] could be understood. That would just
[29:47] maybe we would think talking. But it's
[29:50] more than just talking to one another,
[29:51] but speak to yourselves in psalms. That
[29:54] word psalm, it comes from the word
[29:56] meaning to strike or twanging. And all
[29:59] the people from Kentucky said, "Amen.
[30:02] It speaks of a twanging kind of the
[30:04] striking of a chord of a musical
[30:06] instrument. It means to sing or to make
[30:07] melody. A striking a twanging. It gives
[30:10] that sense of a of a a note being played
[30:13] an acoustical tone. So sing in speak to
[30:17] yourselves in psalms. That's a striking
[30:20] the the the plane of a chord in hymns.
[30:23] That's sacred songs of praise. In
[30:27] spiritual songs. So you have psalms, you
[30:29] have hymns, but then you even have these
[30:31] songs that are inspired within you to
[30:34] give praise to God. We have psalms
[30:38] and we have hymns and then we have songs
[30:40] that are inspired within the heart. But
[30:42] these spiritual songs that give praise
[30:44] to God. So psalms which is psalmos and
[30:47] hymns and spiritual songs there is owed
[30:50] are external expressions of this praise
[30:53] to God. speaking to yourselves in psalms
[30:55] and hymns and spiritual songs. It's not
[30:57] entertainment.
[30:59] It's expression.
[31:01] There's a way that music can be
[31:03] manipulated to where it's no longer
[31:05] being identified as a form of
[31:07] expression, but it's being it's being
[31:09] used as a form of entertainment.
[31:12] And we may think that we're merely just
[31:14] being entertained. But if you don't
[31:15] understand what's being expressed, you
[31:18] could be as John Trapper said that
[31:20] you're watering your soul with the heart
[31:23] of the writer.
[31:27] Singing ado, it's how which where we get
[31:29] the songs, the ode from singing. Then
[31:31] notice it says singing and making melody
[31:33] in your heart to the Lord. So this
[31:35] singing
[31:36] is similar to the spiritual songs and
[31:40] making melody. It comes from the same
[31:41] word of the psalms in your heart. Now
[31:44] there's an internal
[31:46] song in your heart. There's an internal
[31:50] psalm. There's an internal uh hymn that
[31:52] takes place within your heart. So on one
[31:55] hand we have psalms and hymns and
[31:58] spiritual songs that we're speaking to
[32:00] one another a and that's being it's
[32:03] being expressed to one another. So it's
[32:06] the external praise. But before there
[32:07] can be a true non-hypocritical
[32:11] uh genuine external expression, he says
[32:14] then you must be singing and making
[32:16] melody in your heart. I said he says you
[32:18] must I'm trying to make that point that
[32:20] there's also this singing and making
[32:21] melody in your heart in order to have
[32:24] those psalms and those hymns in that
[32:27] plain speech which glorifies the Lord.
[32:30] It's that coalescing
[32:32] that fusing together of your musings.
[32:35] this mapping the architecture of your
[32:38] thoughts to the architecture of sound
[32:42] where time
[32:44] I'm using music a musical language but
[32:45] time becomes measured or there's a meter
[32:47] to it I have thoughts I have I have
[32:50] these things that are in my mind but now
[32:52] as I begin to think I begin to make
[32:54] melody I begin to sing my thoughts begin
[32:56] to kind of come together and then I take
[32:59] that architecture of my thoughts and I
[33:01] begin to use it on top of something that
[33:04] orders it something that shapes it,
[33:05] something that gives it a a meaning. So
[33:09] this time spent within my thoughts, this
[33:11] musing, this thinking, it it finds this,
[33:13] it becomes measured where there's a
[33:14] meter to it and the affections become
[33:17] melody and my thoughts begin to form
[33:19] something other than chaos.
[33:23] In Isaiah 51:3,
[33:27] think of how the absence of music
[33:29] indicated a wasteland. But now it says,
[33:31] "Certainly the Lord will console Zion.
[33:34] He will console all her ruins, that
[33:37] desolation, that wasteland. He will make
[33:39] her wilderness like Eden, the delight.
[33:42] It's going to be pleasurable again. Her
[33:44] arid rift valley like the garden of the
[33:46] Lord." And all the Phoenicians said,
[33:48] "Amen." It was looking very nonsoon out
[33:51] there today before church. But the
[33:54] wilderness will become like the garden
[33:56] of the Lord. this arid dry valley like
[33:59] the garden of the Lord. Happiness and
[34:01] joy will be restored to her.
[34:02] Thanksgiving and not the classic film
[34:06] but and the sound of music.
[34:10] Music will what will return and be
[34:12] restored with the Eden with the garden
[34:14] of the Lord with happiness and joy.
[34:16] There's thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is
[34:18] equated with this. Then there's going to
[34:20] be the sound of music.
[34:25] This is what happens when
[34:28] musings thoughts
[34:31] and God begins to make all things work
[34:33] together for good. When you begin to uh
[34:37] uh submit your thoughts to the Lord, you
[34:39] begin to probe and ask questions. And I
[34:41] think that there needs to be a very
[34:43] deliberate, we're taught this in the
[34:44] message of the hour, very deliberate,
[34:46] positive way of thinking that if the
[34:49] negative thought comes, you say, "Nope.
[34:50] Uh-uh. I'm going to reject it." Or turn
[34:51] around and make it positive. Right.
[34:54] In Proverbsap 15 28, you may recall
[34:58] where we read of the heathen
[35:00] how they their heart studyth
[35:02] destruction.
[35:04] It's the only other time this word here
[35:06] is translated this way. The heart of the
[35:08] righteous studyth to answer,
[35:12] but the mouth of the wicked porth out
[35:13] evil things. There are those whose
[35:16] hearts study destruction, and their lips
[35:19] talk of mischief. But now here's a heart
[35:21] of the righteous that studies to answer,
[35:23] not pour out mischief.
[35:25] To study, to answer. But the mouth of
[35:27] the wicked pourth out evil things.
[35:30] Studyth means to muse. The heart of the
[35:33] righteous muses,
[35:35] plots, meditates, devises, imagines. It
[35:38] uses the faculty of the mind. It's that
[35:41] power of thought, the ponderings. It
[35:43] studies to answer
[35:46] which means to respond, to speak, to
[35:49] shout, but it also means to sing and to
[35:52] utter tunefully.
[35:54] So even in the Hebrew language, if one
[35:56] is going to answer, it's not merely yes
[35:59] or no, true or false, A, B or C or all
[36:01] the above, but it's actually to respond
[36:04] or to sing in tune to utter in a way
[36:08] that responds to answer. Uh if somebody
[36:11] says I remember one time I asked a
[36:12] question are you hungry and the answer
[36:14] was they is they are and I'm like they
[36:16] is they are what kind of answers that
[36:19] are you hungry and so there's a way that
[36:22] the answer it actually responds back
[36:24] appropriately
[36:27] to answers to to sing to utter
[36:30] tunefully. The heart of the righteous
[36:33] muses and thinks in order to find
[36:36] harmony
[36:38] in order to answer tunefully.
[36:42] In Psalms 143:5, I remember the days of
[36:45] old. I meditated on all thy works. I
[36:49] muse on the work of thy hands. I don't
[36:52] know if anybody went searching already.
[36:54] He said, "Brother Aaron's using a Greek
[36:55] word again. Let's see if we can find in
[36:57] the Bible." There it is. I muse on the
[37:00] work of thy hands. Notice how that it is
[37:03] important to remember the days of old.
[37:06] It is important to meditate on the
[37:08] things that he has done. It is important
[37:09] to muse on the work of his hands. A lot
[37:14] of times there's people that say, "Well,
[37:15] that's in the past and you can't do this
[37:17] and you can't do that." There's a way
[37:18] that people try to disregard the things
[37:20] that have happened. But there is a
[37:22] healthy way to remember the days of old
[37:24] and to meditate on all the works of the
[37:26] Lord. He says, "I muse on the works of
[37:28] thy hands." As the righteous studies to
[37:31] be to sing tunefully, "I meditate and
[37:34] muse on the work of thy hands." We're
[37:37] encouraged over and over again in the
[37:38] scripture to meditate, to think, to use
[37:40] this faculty of thought to be very
[37:42] deliberate about what we begin to
[37:44] ponder. Psalms chapter 1:2, "But his
[37:47] delight is in the law of the Lord, and
[37:49] in his law does he meditate, not just at
[37:51] night, but day and night." Amen.
[37:54] In Joshua 1:8, this is what good success
[37:58] is dependent upon. The book of the law
[37:59] shall not depart of thy mouth, but thou
[38:01] shalt meditate therein day and night.
[38:04] The secret to it remaining in your mouth
[38:06] is to first meditate in your heart. If
[38:09] you're not meditating therein day and
[38:12] night, then it's not going to be in your
[38:13] mouth that you that thou mayest observe.
[38:17] You must meditate, muse upon it day and
[38:19] night, that thou mayest observe to do
[38:21] all that is written therein.
[38:23] according to all that is written
[38:24] therein. For then shalt thou make thy
[38:26] way prosperous, and then thou shalt have
[38:28] good success. It's cause and effect
[38:31] that this internal process of musing
[38:35] should produce an external product. And
[38:37] it does. Just as the wicked muse on
[38:40] mischief, they produce chaos. Just as
[38:43] they study wicked things and
[38:45] destruction, it produces uh the the
[38:48] evil. But now if you will meditate and
[38:50] muse upon the right kind of things, this
[38:53] internal process of what is in your mind
[38:55] will produce good success
[38:59] and it still has a musical note to it.
[39:02] In Psalm 77:6,
[39:05] I call to remembrance my song in the
[39:07] night. I commune with my own heart in my
[39:11] spirit made diligent search. Here again
[39:14] it is finding some solitude, some rest,
[39:17] some time of meditation, a time of
[39:20] prayer wherein you're making remembrance
[39:22] of your song.
[39:24] How has my what has my tone been like?
[39:27] What has my tune been like? What has
[39:29] been my rhythm, my beat? What what has
[39:31] been the sound that I've been producing?
[39:32] I commune with my own heart. I examine
[39:35] and probe my own thoughts. My spirit
[39:37] makes diligent search.
[39:41] In Psalms 105:2, sing unto him. Sing
[39:44] psalms unto him. Talk ye of his
[39:46] wonderful works. Again, that word talk
[39:48] ye there means muse. Think about,
[39:51] ponder, muse on his wonderful works.
[39:54] It's when you begin to muse on his
[39:55] works. When you begin to make diligent
[39:57] search, then you sing from the thought,
[40:00] from the thinking of his wonderful
[40:02] works, that's what provokes the singing.
[40:09] It's a very uh I would say a very simple
[40:12] formula if you want to get into the
[40:13] scripture. When they sang something
[40:15] happened, they could appreciate it and
[40:16] they burst forth into song. It wasn't s
[40:19] someone sitting down saying, "Man, I
[40:20] really want to write a banger. Man, I
[40:22] want it to have these bars. I want this
[40:23] to work and got a rap battle coming up.
[40:26] What rhymes with orange?" No, it's it's
[40:27] nothing like that. It's the spontaneous
[40:30] inspiration of seeing the hand of God,
[40:32] seeing something work, and then you
[40:34] begin to think about it. You begin to
[40:36] ponder it. As you begin to turn it over
[40:37] in your mind, how your day started, what
[40:39] it went through, where you are at the
[40:40] end, then it begins, it begins to
[40:42] compose. A day, I promise you, you try
[40:45] it tonight. A day that seemed to be an
[40:48] absolute waste, if you can go before the
[40:50] Lord and say, "Man, that service was
[40:52] nothing more than a muse." But begin to
[40:54] bring it before the Lord and begin to
[40:56] ponder, begin to probe. Lord, you work
[40:58] all things together for good. Lord, you
[41:00] promised you would sustain me. There's a
[41:02] way that all of a sudden you begin to
[41:03] recognize the notes and the harmonies
[41:05] and the rhythm and the way that God
[41:07] works.
[41:12] It says in Psalm 55:17,
[41:15] "Evening and morning and at noon will I
[41:18] pray." That word pray in the Hebrew is
[41:21] also akin, it could be translated to
[41:23] muse. Evening, morning and at noon will
[41:25] I pray and cry aloud and he shall hear
[41:28] my voice. That voice, the sound of an
[41:31] instrument. As I muse evening and
[41:34] morning and at noon, morning, noon, and
[41:36] night. As I muse and as I think, there
[41:39] comes a cry. There comes a sound of an
[41:42] instrument, and he will hear it.
[41:45] We're admonished in the New Testament
[41:47] the same. In Colossians chapter 3:es 1
[41:50] and 2, if ye then be risen with Christ,
[41:55] seek those things which are above where
[41:57] Christ siteth on the right hand of God.
[41:59] If we have indeed been resurrected, if
[42:02] you have indeed been baptized by one
[42:04] spirit into the body of Christ, if you
[42:06] have been awakened, awake and rise, you
[42:09] that sleep, wake those and rise, those
[42:11] who've been dead in sins and trespasses,
[42:13] then we ought to seek those things which
[42:16] are above. So it says in verse two, "Set
[42:20] your affections, affection on things
[42:23] above, not on things on the earth."
[42:25] Amen. The affection is you're musing,
[42:27] you're thinking, you're pondering,
[42:29] you're imagining, you're devising,
[42:30] you're plotting. There has to be a
[42:32] deliberate setting.
[42:35] Remember how brother Brandham cautions
[42:37] us? Don't sit there and try to make your
[42:38] mind go blank.
[42:40] So, I'm going to I'm going to meditate.
[42:42] I'm going to light up that incense. I'm
[42:44] going to drop a few gummies. I'm going
[42:45] to sit cross-legged on the floor. I'm
[42:47] going to hold my hand. Just let my mind
[42:50] go blank. He says, "You'll get
[42:51] something." that that's not what we're
[42:53] talking we're not talking about a
[42:54] dumbing down chemically o of our
[42:57] endocrine system or our cortisol and all
[43:00] those different things. It's not it's
[43:01] not a way we're trying to chemically
[43:03] mellow out, but it's a deliberate
[43:05] setting of your thoughts.
[43:08] A deliberate setting of your thoughts on
[43:10] things above. Set your affections on
[43:13] things above.
[43:15] We read some of this on Sunday I believe
[43:16] in Philippians chapter 4:es 4
[43:20] to 8 or 9 says rejoice in the Lord
[43:23] always and again I say rejoice. Does
[43:26] that not re does rejoicing not have some
[43:28] sort of maybe to us a musical
[43:30] connotation? We we think in terms of
[43:33] rejoicing to be maybe even a praise or
[43:35] song. Let your moderation be known unto
[43:37] all men.
[43:39] It's not so much in the limiting of
[43:42] things and the lack of excess, but
[43:44] rather you're you're yielding to be
[43:46] fruitful. The Lord is at hand. Be
[43:48] careful for nothing. Be anxious for
[43:50] nothing. Anxiety is that curse. That
[43:53] angst is a curse on uh the the youthful
[43:56] generation of today. It's the biggest
[43:58] curse upon them. And it's something we
[43:59] find everywhere. So much anxiety. But in
[44:03] everything by prayer and supplication
[44:05] with thanksgiving, let your requests be
[44:07] made known unto God. There is a
[44:10] supplication. There is a thanksgiving.
[44:12] There are requests being made known. But
[44:14] notice how much the word and I could
[44:15] have spent much more time than I am
[44:17] tonight. And I realize I probably had
[44:18] more time to do it. But psalm after
[44:20] psalm after psalm, scripture after
[44:22] scripture after scripture that speaks of
[44:24] the meditations of one's heart leading
[44:27] to praise upon the lips.
[44:29] that if there can be uh that music is
[44:32] something that's composed and formed and
[44:34] something that comes together in time.
[44:39] It's something that is is not just done
[44:43] in an instant, but it's crafted in time
[44:46] where there may begin just a a slight
[44:49] sometimes it may just be a melody. It
[44:51] could be just a phrase, but as you begin
[44:53] to ponder, as you begin to think, as you
[44:54] begin to uh indict these things and turn
[44:57] them over in your mind, something begins
[44:59] to happen. A rhythm begins to come, a
[45:00] melody comes to it. And I'm using just
[45:03] music to offer to you the truth of the
[45:05] scripture that when one will do that,
[45:07] there's something that can pour out and
[45:10] come out as an expression of that.
[45:14] And it says, "Let your request be made
[45:17] known." Verse 7, "And the peace of God
[45:18] which passes all understanding shall
[45:21] keep your hearts and minds through
[45:23] Christ Jesus."
[45:25] So then this great conclusion. Finally,
[45:28] brethren, whatsoever things are true,
[45:30] whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
[45:33] things are just, whatsoever things are
[45:35] pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
[45:38] whatsoever things are of good report, if
[45:40] there be any virtue, if there be any
[45:42] praise, think on these things.
[45:47] We all know that there's a negative
[45:48] thought process that just drains us. It
[45:50] weakens us. It seems to deaden our
[45:52] faith. There's a way that you begin to
[45:53] think. And I think all of us have
[45:55] written a really really bad song before
[45:57] where in our minds we thought about the
[45:59] wrong thing and the next thing you know
[46:00] we begin to get cold sweats. We begin to
[46:02] get anxious.
[46:04] And our body begins to physiologically
[46:06] respond to the way that we've thought
[46:08] about every single scenario that it's
[46:09] over. It's done. It's finished. But it
[46:12] says if there's going to be any
[46:14] strength, if there's going to be any
[46:16] song that comes forth from you, things
[46:18] you have to think about things true,
[46:20] honest, just, pure, lovely, good report.
[46:24] Paul is telling the Philippians to set
[46:26] your affections on things above. So,
[46:29] well, how can I do that every day of
[46:30] every moment? How can I do it? Pray all
[46:32] day. Pray all morning. Pray all evening.
[46:34] Pray at noon. Okay, let's just start
[46:36] with finding some time to take my mind
[46:39] and direct it towards the things of God.
[46:42] Amen.
[46:46] Psalms 119 verse 133.
[46:50] I really do feel that that tonight I'm
[46:53] sharing a a real strong principle that
[46:57] may form uh it's going to form the basis
[47:00] for going forward. As I'm looking at the
[47:02] subject of music, I text brother Micah
[47:04] today and I said, "Bro, I can't hold off
[47:08] any longer. I've got to talk about
[47:09] music." And I was wanting I was trying
[47:11] to delay it, trying to put it off. And I
[47:13] wish he could have been here to uh to
[47:14] hear it. He's somebody who's just so
[47:16] gifted in these things and understands
[47:17] these things like many of many many
[47:19] others you hear. But this as I get into
[47:22] this subject of music and there's so
[47:24] many different ways we can approach it.
[47:26] This scripture to me is musical. In
[47:30] Psalms 119 verse 133, you could already
[47:32] see there in my notations in the slide.
[47:34] Order my steps in thy word and let not
[47:38] any iniquity have dominion over me. as
[47:43] it speaks of not allowing any iniquity
[47:45] to control or to influence. He says,
[47:48] "Therefore, order my steps in thy word."
[47:50] How can a young man cleanse his way? By
[47:52] taking heed according to thy word.
[47:54] Psalms 119 has many, many, many musical
[47:57] notes, many different musing references,
[48:00] to think about, to ponder. Order my
[48:03] steps. Order means to compose, to
[48:05] arrange, or direct. Direct my steps. It
[48:09] means a stroke, a beat.
[48:12] time.
[48:14] So, it's not so much just saying, "Lord,
[48:16] tell me where to put my foot. Tell me
[48:18] where to put my foot." And ordering your
[48:21] steps as if it's a here's a pathway,
[48:23] here's the stairs, or you're just you're
[48:25] just set before a bunch of boxes and you
[48:27] got to jump and you don't know which one
[48:28] has a has a spike in it or it's not some
[48:31] it's not trying to just navigate where
[48:33] you take each step, but it's Lord,
[48:35] arrange and compose my beat, compose my
[48:39] time in your word.
[48:42] So the word of God is the main
[48:44] composition.
[48:46] The word of God is is the thing that
[48:48] that gives us the appropriate chords.
[48:51] It's the one that gives us the
[48:52] appropriate rhythm. Order my steps.
[48:54] Order my sounds. Order my striking, my
[48:57] twinging. Order the way that I resonate.
[48:59] Order the way that I sing. Order the way
[49:01] that I live
[49:03] in your word. Composed. Lord, I want to
[49:07] I want to walk according to your
[49:09] composition. So, we're asking God to
[49:11] direct our conduct
[49:14] such that he is a conductor and we are
[49:16] being conducted.
[49:18] Order my steps in thy word. I want I
[49:21] want to match I want to match where
[49:23] you're going. I want to I want to match
[49:25] what you're doing. I want to harmonize,
[49:28] fit in, and be arranged together with
[49:30] you.
[49:32] And just as in Jeremiah and
[49:33] Lamentations, it speaks of that
[49:36] wasteland where dancing is turned to
[49:38] mourning and the young men have stopped
[49:39] playing their music. And we see that the
[49:42] mark of Babylon is it stripped of the
[49:45] harpers and musicians and pipers and
[49:48] trumpeters. There's no more music at all
[49:50] in her.
[49:52] There's a different story for the
[49:54] redeemed, the elect in Jeremiah 33:es
[49:58] 6-11.
[50:01] Behold, I will bring it health and cure,
[50:05] and I will cure them, and will reveal
[50:07] unto them the abundance of peace and
[50:10] truth. And I will cause the captivity of
[50:13] Judah and the captivity of Israel to
[50:14] return, and will build them as at the
[50:16] first. And I will cleanse them from all
[50:19] iniquity. Order my steps in your word
[50:23] that iniquity would not have power and
[50:25] influence over me, would not direct me,
[50:27] would not influence me. The Lord compose
[50:29] me, arrange me, direct my stroke, my
[50:32] beat, my rhythm, my time, my melody, and
[50:35] I will cleanse them from all their
[50:36] iniquity, whereby they have sinned
[50:38] against me. And I will pardon, pardon
[50:40] all their iniquities, whereby they have
[50:42] sinned, and whereby they have
[50:43] transgressed against me. Remember, it
[50:44] was the sins of the people when they
[50:47] lamented that we have sinned
[50:50] and therefore music is no longer with
[50:52] us. Mirthth is gone. The sound of an
[50:54] instrument has been quieted.
[50:56] But now he says, "I'm going to cleanse.
[50:58] I'm going to cure. And it shall be to me
[51:01] a name of joy and praise and honor
[51:04] before all the nations of the earth,
[51:06] which shall hear all the good that I do
[51:08] unto them. And they shall fear and
[51:10] tremble for all the goodness and for all
[51:12] the prosperity that I procure unto it."
[51:15] Thus sayaith the Lord. Again there shall
[51:17] be heard in this place which ye say
[51:19] shall be desolate without man and
[51:21] without beast even in the cities of
[51:23] Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem
[51:25] that are desolate without man without
[51:27] inhabitant without beast and remember
[51:29] without joy without the sound of an
[51:31] instrument without music says the voice
[51:33] of joy and the voice of gladness and the
[51:35] voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
[51:37] the bride and the voice of them that
[51:39] shall say this is the sounding of music.
[51:42] This is with one voice together singing,
[51:44] "Praise the Lord of hosts, for the Lord
[51:46] is good, for his mercy endureth forever.
[51:48] And to them that shall bring the
[51:50] sacrifice of praise into the house of
[51:52] the Lord. For I will cause to return the
[51:54] captivity of the land as at the first,
[51:56] saith the Lord."
[51:59] On this wasteland of Leodysia that we're
[52:02] living in, God has promised a cure.
[52:07] He's promised health,
[52:09] an abundance of peace and truth. And
[52:12] there there is iniquity
[52:15] that wants to shape
[52:18] your melody.
[52:19] So many different influences trying to
[52:21] change your tone. We talk about
[52:22] attitudes, everything. There's a way
[52:23] that we could even look at that into a
[52:25] way to where we can say, well, there
[52:27] there there's a sound to that. There's a
[52:29] way that it it comes across even in the
[52:32] scales. you know, there's certain uh the
[52:34] minors and how and that'll that'll
[52:36] affect a different kind of melancholy,
[52:38] whereas there's there's other sounds
[52:41] that promote more praise or energy.
[52:46] There's a lot to explore just in the
[52:48] subject of music. But I want you to
[52:49] catch this turning, this changing from
[52:54] negative thinking, changing from
[52:56] discordant thoughts and things all over
[52:58] the place. And at the end of the day,
[52:59] your mind's just racing, whatever doom
[53:02] scrolling, whatever binging, whatever
[53:03] you've done, your mind is just all over
[53:05] the place. But then be say, Lord, order
[53:07] these thoughts.
[53:09] Help me to take inventories. It says,
[53:11] I'm going to probe my thoughts. I'm
[53:13] going to make diligent search. And you
[53:15] might find that there's things that you
[53:16] have to outright reject. Say, "No, that
[53:18] thought came and I'm rejecting it. I'm
[53:20] not going to let that roost." And you
[53:21] begin to look through and find a way to
[53:23] where God can begin to set in order your
[53:26] minds and your hearts because it's from
[53:29] that that music will come.
[53:33] If you go and listen to the sermon
[53:36] shalom that brotherham preached at the
[53:38] beginning of 1964,
[53:40] whether you listen to the one that he
[53:42] preached on I think Sunday the 12th,
[53:43] January the 12th, but then the one in
[53:45] Phoenix in the 19th, January 19th or
[53:47] both would just be fine where he deals
[53:50] with this subject, but he says at the it
[53:52] says in paragraph 144, he says, "Now
[53:55] creatures of time we are." That sounds
[53:58] poetic.
[53:59] Now creatures of time we are. Commit
[54:02] your ways to him and he will bring the
[54:05] future outright because we just see him
[54:08] as he is in the word. So as creatures of
[54:11] time
[54:13] there has to be a committal of our ways,
[54:17] our time, our thinking to him so that
[54:20] what comes out of it the future. There's
[54:22] not much that we can do about the past
[54:23] now but if we could commit our ways unto
[54:26] him he says your future will come out
[54:28] all right.
[54:30] And it's then that he begins to change
[54:33] and he and he spends a lot of time
[54:35] trying to understand the day and age
[54:36] that we're living in, the time that
[54:38] we're living in.
[54:40] And and this is John, if you want to put
[54:43] up the the Jeremiah 33 again. I can't I
[54:45] can't remember. I think I noted on
[54:47] there. Shalom. That's why I shalom
[54:50] brings symphony. The symphony of Christ
[54:53] and his bride.
[54:55] This health and cure, this peace, this
[54:58] is abundance of peace and truth. It's
[54:59] going to bring this symphony. And that's
[55:02] it's in this sermon where brother Brand
[55:03] begins to say this. He says that we just
[55:05] commit ourselves to him. He is the word.
[55:07] His word is just like a great symphony.
[55:11] And he makes this statement. If you
[55:14] don't understand the symphony, it's a
[55:17] big bunch of racket to you if you don't
[55:19] understand it.
[55:21] You've got to understand what it is.
[55:24] It's all done by signs and motions, but
[55:26] it acts out a drama in this symphony.
[55:31] We can look at our lives and we say,
[55:33] "This is just a racket. It's just a
[55:34] bunch of noise. It doesn't make any
[55:36] sense." But you've got to understand his
[55:39] symphony.
[55:41] And he puts it in the context of this
[55:42] word is God's sheep music.
[55:45] and that we need to know the mind of the
[55:47] composer and the spirit to direct us so
[55:51] that we can act out our part in this
[55:54] drama.
[55:56] To go just even from the musings about
[55:59] the message, the sympathizing with it,
[56:01] the things that we might hold in our
[56:03] minds, but come down to where God can
[56:05] begin to arrange it in such a way to
[56:07] where it compels us forward to fulfill
[56:09] his word. Let's stand tonight.
[56:12] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[56:28] There is a theme in the word that I hope
[56:30] that I've highlighted to some degree
[56:34] of how that there can be chaotic
[56:35] thoughts that produce a chaotic
[56:38] temperament, chaotic action. The Bible
[56:41] calls it a a wickedness, destruction or
[56:44] mischief.
[56:46] But then with the same mind, if we could
[56:48] make bring it subject to the word of God
[56:50] and we could ask God to to take our
[56:53] thoughts and direct them towards things
[56:54] that are pure and honest and true and
[56:56] good
[56:58] that what could have been chaotic, what
[56:59] could have been mischief, what could
[57:01] have produced just a wasteland in your
[57:03] minds,
[57:06] now all of a sudden something begins to
[57:07] take shape and meaning comes forth. And
[57:10] God could take something that is ugly
[57:13] and make it beautiful.
[57:16] Gracious heavenly father, tonight Lord,
[57:18] as we bow our heads and our hearts
[57:19] before you, we yield ourselves to you as
[57:21] instruments.
[57:23] That is our prayer. Lord, let me be an
[57:25] instrument.
[57:27] Lord, I've piped and I've harped of my
[57:29] own accord.
[57:31] I've sounded and I've let loose and I've
[57:34] shriveled and shrieked. I played the
[57:36] part of the
[57:39] the human French horn and all I produced
[57:42] was noise and foolishness.
[57:45] But Lord, I pray that I could begin to
[57:48] think more like you. That I could take
[57:50] my thoughts and direct them toward your
[57:52] word. That I could diligently seek out,
[57:54] search my heart, take inventory of my
[57:57] day, find that quiet time at night.
[58:01] And Lord, it may be that as soon as our
[58:03] head hits the pillow, our thoughts begin
[58:05] to race
[58:07] and there's questions that are asked and
[58:08] there's things that are remembered.
[58:11] So Lord, I pray that we could be in a
[58:13] more
[58:15] deliberate habit of quieting our
[58:18] thoughts
[58:20] in the evening time.
[58:23] Truly Lord, that's one of the designs of
[58:25] family devotion. It's one of the designs
[58:27] of family prayers.
[58:29] We take for a moment to direct our
[58:32] thoughts to you.
[58:36] And we take inventory not only of our
[58:38] own hearts,
[58:40] but we speak of your goodness.
[58:44] And Lord, may it be that when we do
[58:46] that,
[58:48] there just be that gentle melody
[58:51] that brings us the peace we need to get
[58:53] the sleep we desperately need.
[58:57] Lord, as we're bombarded on every side
[58:59] and as the devil's pressing in with the
[59:01] perversion of tone and the perversion of
[59:05] melody, may we find that true heartbeat
[59:09] and take these arrangements of our
[59:11] thoughts, this architecture of our human
[59:12] thoughts, Lord, and may it be matched
[59:14] together with the architecture of your
[59:16] music
[59:18] so that we can sing a song with our
[59:21] lives. Bless us tonight, I pray. Give us
[59:24] the strength we need for this journey as
[59:25] we commit it to you in the name of the
[59:28] Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:30] Amen.
