TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're preaching again tonight on wonderlust and wonder lost this is part six this will be the last service Lord willing if he would will on this particular subject on wonder lust and wonder lust today's title is rest refocus and I'm using that just as uh even Commandments or encouragements rest refocus this is kind of what's been a driving theme in my heart as we've looked at the subject matter I'm sure you could see the tie-ins in terms of the things that drive us and get our attention and we struggle with that we're wanting just to rest and refocus and this is the conclusion this is the conclusion of wonderlust and wonder lost a series that I would say is about desire human desire but also The Wonder of Christ and tonight I just want to preach a capping message I just want to preach it without trying to go back and tie different things in I'm just trusting that there's been enough groundwork that's been laid enough material been put out there and so we wanted to kind of preach a message that can sum it up and leave it in a good spot and um but then also draw from all the other services that we've preached thus far and I trust in doing so you can be encouraged okay I was starting to wonder if maybe we misplaced the amens in the move and maybe they maybe they swept those up and put them in the dumpster so uh just relax and I'll feed on the eight men's I'll take it as some currency um tonight and in the beginning even when we started this the inspiration was even asking the question that can we restore our sense of wonder when it comes to the things of God and there might be a part of us that feels that we're maturing we're no longer oohing and owing after childish things and we know that bodily exercise doesn't profit very much and so we don't look to certain things in the physical and we kind of look at a maturing faith in a way and say well my faith is mature and I'm not relying so much on these other things and I know this and I've heard that and everything seems to get settled but it might be good to ask ourselves is this Faith or am I getting numb have I lost my sense of wonder for the things of God are there things about the word that used to enthuse me I used to get excited about and it's really not Faith that's operating now it's more just a sense of I'm not as excited about it as I was before and so we're looking at rekindling our love for Jesus Christ being excited about the things of God being excited about the message as fellowshipping today with my wife and talking about different situations and really what it's going to take to make a Rapture and to me in my heart regardless of what someone's situation is if they fall in love with the message and feed on it and if they're in a different Church situation wherever it might be if they fall in love with this message and feed on it God's going to give them what they need to make it in a Rapture going to give them what they need for their family and for their home and I just believe that and so that's the one thing you want the people to be excited about and energized by is the word of God and we we touched on this I think this has been a consistent theme of how is it that we can break out of this numbness of lukewarmness and this uh all the kind of the dullness that we get in our lives and we said that Breaking Free from lukewarmness begins with identifying all the numbing agents that are in our lives the things that are overloading our senses and overwhelming us with burdens and cares and anxieties and as that our heart weighs down even the psalmist said my heart is so drawn it Cleaves to the Earth I'm unable to look up I'm unable to be expected I'm unable to have hope and so we want to as the scripture says look up your Redemption drop night look up from the things that we're scrolling on look up from all the things that have our attention and that's the that's the quickest way to start restoring The Wonder of Christ is finding all the things that are kind of pushing our head into the Dust in Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 8 it says all things are full of Labor you'll recognize many of the scriptures we use tonight we're just wanting to preach them as a capping to this all things are full of Labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with sin nor the ear filled with hearing as we looked at that before we realized it's saying that all things are never at rest they're always changing things are one way one day they're different the next day all things are full of Labor they're constantly changing it means it's Restless turning over and it says the eye is not seen uh satisfied with sin or the ear filled with hearing it's this restlessness with the eye a wrestling restlessness with The Ear The Eye may see something but then it knows there's more to be seen so it wants to see it the ear may hear something but it knows there's more to hear something just changes just a little bit anymore I found that there's a in every song that comes out now there's an acoustic version there's a live version there's a sped up version there's a house remix right uh uh and and then there's an 80s techno one and every song I'm talking about Christian music I'm not talking about you know my uh some other playlist I've got going on I'm just saying every song you go to look it up and there's some remix with it why because even the ear is not satisfied with the radio version they want to hear a deep cut off the B side uh that has just a little bit different vibe with it and that's the way the ear works that's the way that the eye works it's never satisfied and the writer's saying this is all things are Topsy Turvy changing tumultuous and if he's writing this in whatever year he was riding it can I say it's just gotten worse that if one is observing as Solomon could everything that the world had to offer both good and bad what money could buy what luxuries and fineries would be available what entertainments and social things could have he had it even the wisdom that he thought would bring him happiness he's saying everything changes and if it was bad then it's only gotten worse as man continues to invent ways to try to satiate and be filled that's what the words are used there the eye is not satisfied sated it's not the ear is not fulfilled with hearing it's he's inventing many different ways to uh to find that satisfaction and the modern technologies that we use for many different conveniences they've all capitalized on and manipulated our hard-wiring as human beings and our chemistry every single one of them they've Advanced at this point where there's things they did back in the day and they just did it and they did it till they found it it worked I tried this and it didn't sell I tried this and it didn't sell I tried this and it didn't work but then I tried this and it worked and through trial and error and through marketing they've been able to use things that get people's attention and now they've actually been able to kind of pull back the curtain a little bit by signs and say this is actually what's happened in people's minds when you do this this is what happens when you allow this to happen and that time so now everything is calculated everything is designed everything is planned and it's all done to try to work off of our hard wiring and our brain chemistry to to manipulate us and to control us and it's made us Restless as we've been using the phrase maybe for a dopamine hit we got to scratch that itch we feel kind of restless and that's that wonderlust for synthetic high from something that's fake that we have this wonderless where we want to uh we want these fake we we get some sort of sense of Happiness which is very very shallow from fake accomplishments from things that have a ping that have a ring that have a sound that flash that do something that that excites us but yet there's really no substance in it and brother Branham says this about the laodicean church age we've got that insured I think so we're good he says it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things this is the age that we're living and it cries we've got everything we need we've got this we've got that it cries with that there's a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire this is the age that we're living in this is the if you want to hear a characterization of the age we're living in it says they cry that they have a great amplitude of all things and the church said okay right that was not very enthusiastic remember we're talking about everybody else out there come on relax a little but we cry that we have a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire and it's this characterization that helps us understand even better what Revelations 3 17 means because they're saying wow we're rich we're increased with Goods we have need of nothing but their actions declare otherwise burning with an unsatisfied fire in other words desire has not produced the right thing it hasn't produced satisfaction it's not producing some sort of patience it's not producing endurance it's not producing I'm content with what I have it's burning like an unsatisfied fire and in this our attention spans have shrunk and we're no longer to achieve longer periods of thought or quiet we're unable to we've lost the ability to focus uh it's becoming weaker we're uneasy with silence we're uneasy when things are just still we need something to kind of fill it up imagine if we all came in here before service 30 minutes early and there was nothing on the overhead there was no music playing everything was just still we'd start getting uncomfortable because we're no longer comfortable with something still we're no longer comfortable with quiet we get uneasy when something's not moving and something's not flashing when there's no lights and so this is if you if you're trying to you're waiting for me to call out what it is you have to make this applicable I everyone every single one of us have some other way this is Manifest in itself because guess what I'm using scriptures that have been used for a couple thousand years I'm using quotes that have been used for decades and they had their application and days gone by and they'll have various applications among us tonight just exactly how our attention and our focus is being lost and how the world is using different things to kind of side track US John chapter 10 verse 10 it says the thief cometh not but for to steal and there's a thief's not coming to add the thief's not coming to give the thief is not coming to make things better but it comes to steal and to kill and to destroy so there's a thief that wants to take from you there's a thief that wants to kill something they want to destroy something if they can't take it they want to kill it if they can't kill it they just want to ruin it there's a thief that wants to do that but he says I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly this phrase awakens us to the reality that we can have life but then you can also have it more abundantly it's not just a matter of breathing but it's about it's about thriving and living well and having things in our lives that are worth living for so he says I am come that you might have life and that you have life more abundantly if I could say this and if it sounds old-fashioned I mean it with all my heart the word is the way to live Christ says I am come that you might have life I'm come that you might live and that in living you might have it more abundantly in other words the word is the way to live but the thieves are robbing they're killing and destroying our peace our patience our desire for God our pleasure that's what the thief comes to do I'm identifying all these different uh information and communication Technologies all these uh gadgets or games or apps or opportunities and they can just even be Pursuits we have a lot more recreational opportunities available to us in the day that we're living in uh there's there's space made for that there's accommodation given there's opportunities and resources that allow us uh to be that's one of the things about Phoenix is there's no off season when it comes to baseball you can play baseball year round if you want to and I imagine that they probably even have fantasy leagues even for the for all the semi-pro leagues and the all the high school leads that are going on you can stay busy in sports every day of the year in a climate like this and so there's all sorts of things that I would like to refer to as thieves that are robbing killing or destroying your peace your patience your pleasure and with the death of patience comes the loss of Hope and with the loss of hope it leads to the lack of real living the lack of life and one phrase it and if I could just say this I meant to say it in the outset that maybe a lot of the things I'm sharing tonight are these little pieces that we didn't spend some time on that we just had in our heart from the beginning and a phrase I've been wanting to use I think I've just referred it a few times as a zombie scroll it's a phrase that if you use in within Media or technology they're certainly mindful of it because it's just it's zombie School refers to a Mindless action just out of habit and the phrase that was used by some of the ones that first coined it with no real destination or benefit it's a Mindless scroll it's the moving of the thumb I just uh the that constant repetitive movement where there's it's a Mindless action out of habit if I could tie it into some of the things we've mentioned before kind of this constantly seeking out a reward that that just that right one that we can follow the right one that we can uh we can kind of whatever it is you do smash subscribe subscribe you know turn on notifications whatever it is send a like there retweet there's just something you're waiting for that moment to fire off and then because of this zombie mindset uh it our minds are unfocused and the more unfocused our minds are getting the the more unsatisfied we're becoming or dissatisfied we're becoming and if anything we're just more distracted than we've ever been before I know we've mentioned this before and it's probably well well known and been entered into many people's uh vocabulary these days is the Paradox of choice and scientifically and academically they're still debating it and they're still wondering whether or not some of the studies can be replicated or the findings can be replicated so let's select the academics um debate it and go by your own experience when you're given more things to choose from you're generally less happy with the choice you made he's like man I knew I should have ordered you know number 612 of of the 1200 thing you know 1200 options I've had my my common dad joke when I go to a place like Cheesecake Factory is can I have the large menu right because they just give you pages and pages I didn't order an encyclopedia there's there's pages and pages of choices and the more options you have the least satisfied you're going to be so think about the day and age we're living in when there's there's more flavors of water now than you had choices in blue jeans when you were a kid and there's more options and more choices it just makes us more uh fragmented and Scattered and and more upset and distracted the Bible says in Ecclesiastes chapter 6 verse 7 all the labor of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled maybe we could preach that to speak of gluttony um still remember brother Lonnie Jenkins preaching on it once but man seeks to satisfy his selfish urges that to say um it Labor's for his mouth it's for self-gratification you know it's man is not laboring for your somebody else's mouth or even his family's mouth but a man first seeks to satisfy his own urges and his own desires but it says but yet the appetite is not filled in other words he's never really happy from it I'm going to labor as the Bible says that all things are full of Labor I'm going to labor to make myself happy but I'm never able to make myself happy so I just keep laboring to make myself happy and they're just kind of caught up in this constant working to satisfy an urge but the Bible says in Galatians chapter 5 verse 24 and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections in lust quite a remarkable scripture could I just make an observation if it feels this weird when we open up this big it'll be scary if we ever get a higher ceiling in a bigger Church we might just have to force people to sit on all the front rows and maybe build in a drop ceiling first and just slowly raise it up over a couple years before we just kind of know oh wait a minute because it just it feels just a little bit different tonight so if there's more room for sound if there's more room that I'm trying to take up with my voice you fill it with amens and will feel warm and fuzzy this scripture here to me is one that is very remarkable maybe easy to be misunderstood it says they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust it we read it to say if you are Christ or if I could put it this way it does not say if you are Christ then your flesh with its affections and lust are dead is saying they that our Christ have crucified the flesh with affections and lust so we could read it to say well if I was Christ then my affections and lust would be dead but that's not the way that it's written because the affections that are mentioned here are just merely your emotions and it says that lust speaks of um the wrong kind of desires so it's not saying that the barometer to determine whether or not you are Christ and been baptized into Christ is that you have no emotions and no wrong desires but it does mean something that they that are Christ are in the habit and manner of taking any wrong emotion and making it subject to Christ and taking any wrong desire in making it subject to Christ being a Christian does not mean that being joyful in the Lord and happy the Lord is not the absence of any disconcerting emotion doesn't mean I'm never sad just means I'm always believing but this kind of the emotional Harmony that comes or that we can have as a Christian is knowing that my sadness does not overrun me that my despair does not drive me that my emptiness and my anxiety is not my kind of my banner or my covering but I can be I can be at a some level of confidence and have some sort of stability saying I know I'm sad I know I'm hurting I know I'm frustrated but Christ is my is my banner he's the one that will cover me so the Bible says if you are Christ you crucified the flesh that strong language crucified would be the most horrible punishment means to kill it to private of Life your emotions and your wrong desires Romans 8 13 if you live after the flesh ye shall die we have to think of this not just in terms of one or the other it's absolute that if you live after the flesh you're going to die a physical death and that you'll die spiritually and you can't be a son or daughter of God he's speaking morally in this ethical sense of your confidence in your spirit and Your vitality as a believer that if you live after the flesh you're going to spiritually dying but if ye remember the scripture if you eat through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live therefore we have through the spirit the power to mortify the Deeds of the body under the influence of the spirit we can be active in our own mortification of the Deeds of the body the desires of the flesh the longings and the wants of our minds and our Spirits if you live after just the wants of the mind and the spirit if you just kind of obey your thirst and you're driven by the things that uh your mind wants then he says that's death but if you can buy the spirit mortify that then you shall actually live Colossians 3 5 says mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth this the members here is it's not a commandment to the leadership of a church to kill the members of it nor is it commandment to get deprive a physical life of any member in your body but it says mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth this is how you do it and these are the members it's talking about these these working things fornication I don't need to give the definitions of these I believe you could find your own appropriate definition uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness it says which is idolatry and this is speaking of all these things and saying deprive of power the things that deify yourself deify your flesh in other words it gives preeminence to what your mind wants what your spirit wants uh and and what you you might be inclined to do physically what you might be inclined to do by Desire by emotion deprived of power the things that worship yourself deify yourself and the things that are created over the things of God because to practice these things the fornication then cleanness the jealousy the lusting the covetousness the inordinate affection the lack of moderation it says is idolatry it places self over God as I was reading these scriptures today and just looking over my notes it's crucified the flesh mortified the Deeds mortified Therefore your members this is this is an instruction that works against the Instinct of laodicea an age which is people's rights an age which is about preservation and age which is to accommodate and and allow yourself to uh to be yourself and to uh make contingencies for any any person's uniqueness or peculiarities to where now uh you know we don't even believe you should I believe that we have to we ought to have the right to be offended ourselves and we ought to just carry that and say you know what I'm going to be offended it's just the time we're living in but everyone's wanting to be so careful about people's rights and the way people are to our now layout to see is just characterize the exact opposite of this because there's no self-sacrifice there's no pain there's no denying the flesh as a matter of fact they expressed the flesh instead of subduing it give expression to those thoughts you're having give expression to the battles you're having it's completely opposite to the scripture I wish I had a way to express this I've been reading some things and and I it's I guess in a way as I read it I realize this is very heavy dense reading that's kind of maybe from a philosophical standpoint but if I could just kind of put it in my own words the Bible is so beautiful in that as you read the gospels and you read the New Testament and even as it's joined to the Old Testament it answers all the questions it's it's not like the the traditional mythologies it's not like all the the myths that have been passed down it's not all the the heroes Journeys that are in there there's not all the uh all the the ways that they try to say all the patterns in the gospel and all the patterns in the Bible that you see the saying Ark and storyline in every other religion and all sorts of other cultures but none of them have the answers that the cross has none of them have the answer that the empty grave has none of them have the answer that the way the Bible approaches says look we're just going to pull the curtain back and we're going to be honest about human nature we're going to be honest about mythology we're going to be honest about Legends we're going to be honest about the mind going to be honest about humanity and it's the only one that answers the weakness of mankind the rest have built a religion to prop up their weakness and so laodicea does it gives expression to the flesh instead of mortifying it but I believe that by faith we can control our Feelings by faith we can uh control our emotions and subdue the our wrong wants or our wrong desires as it says they that are Christ have crucified we can bring under subjection our feelings and our emotions we can subdue the wrong wants and the wrong desires as so much of this has been building off the definition of wonderlust that dissatisfaction that Restless Drive just trying to find something that can make us happy and fulfilled brother Brown says if your faith is set right we've read it enough or some of you may be able to finish it and if our faith is set right in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction what that needs what is it that needs to be set right in the right position our faith not the pulpit some of you may be sitting here going oh man mathematically that's just not in the right spot they're not using the golden ratio to put the Cajon and the piano and the bass and and brother Aaron's head is taller than the backdrop and you just didn't realize how tall I am there's all sorts of things you might be thinking oh no oh no on this no no no no no no you got to get your faith set right it's not getting everybody where they need to be it's not about getting all your Ducks lined up and if I could just get this and I think I just get that and you think that in your life you're just going to allow things to kind of magically click into space and like oh there you go got it everything's clicking everything's in the place that it needs to be then I'm going to be happy and you're running the numerology and you're running this and you're running that you're trying to figure out no let that take care of itself let the calendar let economics let politics let it all take care of itself if you can get your faith set right in the right position that's what gives constant satisfaction and by constant satisfaction and contentment I'm not just referring to uh you know some Franciscan monk that's just like I'll just take the haircut and the driving clothes and I'll just be happy with the vegetables I grow in my garden and just kind of live this forced austereness no we're talking about real Joy a constant satisfaction not a a legalistically imposed austerity or legalistically imposed sadness and soberness but real real happiness focus on this statement I don't have it for you in the slides but I want to read this as a maybe just a quote that you can write down and uh and do it in a really nice font with a good filter and put it on Instagram hashtag real living he says you've got to have faith but you've got to know how to use that faith to make yourself well to get happiness out of life you know why we may not be getting the happiness and satisfaction we want out of life because we're trying to use everything else but faith you might say well I have faith great and I'm not happy oh now that you have faith you have to know how to use it he says not only to make yourself well we might say oh that has to do with physical healing well it's emotional healing as well it's some sort of Harmony among the parts and to get happiness out of life here's the secret to all believers the world have other means to give them what they call happiness but for a Believer God has given you Faith to get the satisfaction you want out of life and you say oh no oh no I wish I could get it out of a bottle I wish I could get it out of a pill I wish I could get it out of accomplishment sorry he elected you to something different you might as well just lean into it and just accept it that your real satisfaction is going to come from using your faith right because that's how a Believer gets happiness out of life when we preached on a desired detox I was not suggesting a simple dopamine detox nor was I suggesting a digital detox what I was suggesting was a death to deadly desire that in a desire detox it's recognizing that even a dopamine detox is somewhat of a misnomer because it's always active there's always dopamine present in your brain unless you have some serious disease and it's not something that we want to just regulate dopamine and figure out ways we can all build a sense deprivation tank on some other part of this property so we can figure out ways it's my turn it's my week just to deprive my no that's not it it's not gimmicky it's not some sort of new fad where you gotta we're going to try a dopamine detox or even a digital detox I think uh some of those things are great in individual circumstances and may work well with certain things but as a church I'm not prescribing a digital detox we all throw away um our blackberries and we all get rid of our uh Commodore 64s or whatever it is we're using these days I'm not I'm not suggesting that I'm not suggesting that we get rid of anything but or even change habits except to the extent that you recognize there's things in your life that are stimulating desire I mean there's things that are 8-bit that are just as addictive as things that are that are in full HD and 3D so it's more recognizing desire you can say well you know brother Aaron the best series you ever preached was on wonderlust and wonder lost I got rid of all of my digital devices and and I no longer have any screens and it's just been it's been a life changer so that's wonderful I haven't seen you in a while at church oh that's because I'm I'm on the reservation at the casino now and I I I don't play the slots brother Aaron they're digital now I just roll the dice and played the cards physical bro they are no batteries it's not I'm not suggestion at all that it has to do with the digital detox or dopamine deprivation it's about death to deadly desires as the Bible says if you live after the flesh you shall die that the labor for the mouth is not satisfying it's recognizing these scriptural things if I could say this it's taking it's a matter of taking deliberate scriptural steps the death of Desire or desire detox is a deliberate scriptural steps to kill the flesh mortify the Deeds of the flesh crucify the flesh through the spirit subduing and mortifying the Deeds of the flesh mortifying your members which are upon the Earth which is like these things that work in idolatry it's a matter of taking those things and starving off and bringing under subjection the carnal desires in doing so this is the theme of rest a Restless mind The Wonder of Christ in doing so it's going to rest and Liberate the mind it's going to allow your mind the mind is what is the the thing that is feeding off of the things of the world your soul doesn't feed off of it so it's not becoming more robust there's something in the mind that's feeding off of it and the more that you can starve desire and get this begin to detox the desire of the Mind the chemistry the hardwiring get that get the mind to slow down the more your mind will be able to contemplate the more that you'll find Wonder in the things of God the battle in the mind as we mentioned Sunday brother Branham said the battle in the mind he said the place where decisions are made the mind is what controls actions it's what controls thought there's just you could think about this in a very broad way just how the mind works and just how it's present in everything we do and this battle in the mind is what's raging right now the human mind brother Brahm says was chosen for the place of battle at where it was begun and that is because decisions are made from the mind the head that's why Satan chose the mind but God knowing better chose the heart and all that the world can offer you is some sort of stimulation to the mind to the detriment of the heart and so when we think of the greatest battle ever fought I think we could all agree it's in my mind it's in my mind I'm having mind battles how many battles in my mind and it can be a matter of just all the neurons firing in the brain chemistry and sicknesses and nutrition and all sorts of Mind battles can all come back to things that are happening in the mind and they realize that it's not just the brain that creates the mind but there's things actually in our gut our biome and our gut and all sorts of things that kind of create the person the mind the personality the spirit and brother Adam said the human mind was chosen he's referring to the head because that's the place decisions are made and we recognize the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind but I want to remind you again if there's a place where the battle's being fought it's not just where everyone convenes to fight and then goes back to their strongholds there's a battle in the mind because that's where Satan chose to hunker down and there's a battle because now God is fighting Satan in that Realm if it wasn't for the Holy Spirit fighting in that realm it wouldn't be much of a battle but God is fighting not in your mind but God the word is fighting for your mind I believe that we ought to have this kind of conviction in our heart that it's not just a battle in the mind it's a battle for the mind and that's a battle that I want the Holy Ghost to win and I don't want just Redemption of my soul and I'm not just living for Redemption of my body but I want Redemption of this mind the Bible speaks of it in so many different places Romans 12 2 about the renewing of your mind I've been drawing so much from God's power to transform or the power of transformation how it's by the renewing of our mind the word has power to stabilize your thoughts it has power to win our mind the Bible says in Philippians let this mind be in you brother Stephen Bryant was sharing with me how he was reading in the Bible in the Book of Genesis and he was just remarking how God said let there be and I thought it was a real powerful observation he said it's it's worded in such a way to where God just allowed it let there be that was the act of God creating he allowed it to be that's just how great he was as if there was some Force inside of him and a powers out of a desire to have a vision inside of him that was bound up and if he wanted to see it he just let it happen and then the Bible tells us to let this mind be in you in other words he's given you some sense of power to let it be that it's bound up inside of you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the whole Barnyard full of chickens is saying I hope whatever he does this doesn't let the mother Christ come in him right they're all looking at you like an eagle and everything in this Barnyard in this layout to see in realm chicken Cooper living in is all trying to get you to not let this mind be the Bible no the Bible teaches the message teaches the devil's heard that and all his imps that the bride has the mind of Christ or keep still and so what he's trying to do is make you busy enough to where you won't sit still and so busy you don't recognize you have the mind of Christ and we need to let that mind be in US in Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse excuse me Ecclesiastes chapter seven verse 29 Lo this only have I found this is summary language he gets to the end he says hey at the end of the day this is it fear God and keep his Commandments that's the only way you're going to be happy it's the only way you can secure anything of worth low this only have I found that God hath made man upright God in the beginning made mankind pure but the devil having mingled it man has now he says they have sought out many inventions distracted from distraction by Distraction they sought out many inventions it's processes and meditations of the mind it comes from the root to plan or to devise it's a reckoning in their minds this is important for you to catch this because I'm I am uh this is not a wonderless sermon I know exactly where I'm going to end up they they plan and they devise the word means to reckon so this is man he's Reckoning now he's thinking in his mind this will make me happy this is where true Joy will be oh if I just do this think about Solomon Solomon said I'm the wisest man if I just enjoy luxuries and have the best food and have the best wine and get all the best amenities if I just chase this if I just marry how many wives does it take to be happy well not even a thousand will do it and so he's just looking and trying to find a happiness and trying to figure out something and he's saying they have some sort of plan or scheme some meaning or intent they're Reckoning and it's the process of the mind so it says they have sought out which they seek and they inquire or they desire the things that they're Reckoning they're seeking to satisfy the Reckoning of the mind I reckon if I eat that it'll make me happy I reckon if I can go on that vacation it'll make me happy I'm seeking out all these calculations in my mind that keep telling me Oh trust me if you just do it it'll be the end of it I think all you got to do is go skydiving and you'll never need to climb a mountain you'll never need to do anything else no it's not true just you say well I I climbed a mountain then you find out there's another one taller hey all right and then you then you're trying to climb all the the tallest and then you're trying to climb them backwards with Crocs in Psalms 94 19 with all these they're seeking they're seeking to satisfy Restless mind so think of how the psalmist writes this and to me it's just a sister scripture to what the Solomon was saying in the wisdom in that family and all the different writers of that age certainly this speaks to it that man has sought out many inventions but then it says in the multitude of my thoughts Within Me thy Comforts Delight my soul all these reckonings I imagine if I did this I imagine if I did that all these things that the Mind keeps saying the zombie scroll I'm like oh yeah right and everything that keeps bombarding the Mind here's this Moment of clarity but you know what it's your Comforts that Delight my soul I think it's beautiful that as a church we still come together on a Wednesday night and Sunday mornings that most of you and to your compliment or here 30 minutes early and when we come we're not just shooting the breeze and talking we sit down and we're still and that our services in total are lasting and we're getting out around noon and we're here for two at two and a half hours and I think it's great because that's that's the greatest distance some of us are going to ever get from everything else out in the world and I think it's one of the reasons why the traditional service and the way that we continue to have services and the way that it was established and we can stay true to in the word of God is Services just like this it's because it's not catering to the short attention span where we have pyrotechnics and smoke machines and lights during the song services strobing yeah 10 000 reasons give me another 10 right and you're all hyped up right and everything's great and then it's done and then the pastor gets up they're like is that Armani right and then he talks for a while in some psycho gibberish and like that yeah that was really good that was great I mean it was in 20 minutes 30 minutes right 45 minutes and then guess what they want to heard you out because they got another group waiting to come in for the light show right someone asked us the other day so how many services do you have how big is the church and oh how many services and I was just like one we just have one service like you're Arizona Believers Church shouldn't you have an A and A B and a c right shouldn't there be some more service times as I don't know how many we would have if we broke it up into shifts but I think it's great we do it this way what because we're not going to cater to that base instinct to just give me a snippet if any one of you are working on producing any kind of YouTube shorts for my sermons or you know some tick tocks let's consult first only if we can monetize it but that's not the way the gospels to be preached that's not the way it's supposed to be presented that's not that's not that's not the angle and and maybe I should just qualify nothing to be said about doing that but that's that's not our message this is where it comes through Gatherings like this this is the foresight of God to know that moments like this can strengthen the spiritual man strengthen the internet and give you the kind of fortitude when there's something pressing and wanting you to give in you know say I know that I have it in me to sit still for a while and in the multitude of my thoughts within me it's your comforts with all the activity in our mind our anxieties our fears our desires he's saying God with all the reckonings and all the processes and all the multitude of static and buzzing and pinion that goes on in my head it's whenever it's your consolation that soothes me it's a Soother to satisfy her it's it's that thing that begins to placate us it's a it's a it's the blanket to the child they talk about if when you're raising children and babies there's certain things you give them to kind of soothe them and even as they deal with people with certain ticks and things and mental struggles later in life or anxieties they tell them to do things that can soothe and and certain ways that they try to bring that sense of comfort this is beautiful he says it's your Comforts it's your consolations that soothe me I believe it's a direct rebuttal to wonderlust because it's saying in the multitude of my thoughts your Comforts are what Delight in the multitude of all the thoughts in other words in all this the thinking that my desire is going to somehow lead me to something new or better I find it's your consolation that actually satisfies I've got all these thoughts that there's going to be something novel enough to quench I think I got all these thoughts tell me that there's something better and if I know there's not something better I just feel that if it's something else some pattern interrupt something different that that's going to lock everything into place and finally I'll be able to Exhale and just begin to really live and and what he says it's your consolation it's a rebuttal of this wonderless that says you're not going to find something better it's his Comforts that Delight your soul Ecclesiastes chapter 4 verse 1. so I returned and considered all the oppression that are done under the sun all the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and tears of all those that were oppressed and they had no comforter and we think that makes a lot of sense those who are oppressed they they don't have a comforter they don't have something to satisfy they don't have a place of their own that they return to that they're free from the fear of it being taken the the oppressed have a task master over them that's why they're always unsettled that's why they have no comforter the word there is they have no consolation they have no ease the oppressed have no rest but then it says on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter this is the observation you're not you're not uneasy because you don't have more power you don't have the power you want you haven't accumulated enough it's it's it's changing the thought process that if I could just get to the Top If I Could Be the king of the hill I'll have comfort I only feel this way because I in the I'm in the position I'm in he says the oppressed have no comforter and on the side of their oppressors they that had the power there was no relief from desire there was no relaxing of thirst all the oppressed who have not they they don't have comforter because they have things taken away from they don't have the means to get the things that make them happy they don't have the power to be at rest but on the side where there's power there's no relaxing of their thirst in the sermon Hebrews the series Hebrew series chapter 3 he says you ask them about it listen to this response I I I I know I'm being lengthy uh tonight it's just been so comfortable with just the right uh the right mix of faith and and you pulling the right group of people here tonight is just a a Clear Channel so this is you ask them about uh you know just you're provoking thought and brother Adam he's talking about just this greater desire or hunger and the things of God he says well we got our television that's how we find Comfort all right go ahead and update it right we got our perfect timing that's how we find comfort and he said that's the American attitude we got television we got plenty of money we got Fine Cars got nice homes what do we need with the Lord we don't need that you put a put a beat to that and to go viral we got television we've got plenty of money we got Fine Cars got nice homes what what do we need the Lord with the Lord what are we having we don't need that he says and that's the attitude now if I can say this if it's not thought of or spoken the attitude's evidenced in the action he says this is the attitude now they may not say we've got television we've got Comfort we've got television and money and flying cars nice homes we don't need the Lord we don't need that they're maybe not saying that but the attitude is evident in action they said he says that's their comfort they're trying to find comfort in these luxuries Comforts in Technologies Comforts and television the media and the the sensitize of the Flesh and the satisfying of Desire but there's a greater comforter Jesus said I'll send you a comforter he's an advocate it's one that's summoned to your side to be a helper and discomfort is the one that gives true rest and I'm grateful for this comforter I'm grateful for how brother I'm spoke of the comforter and how in a dangerous day of so much Temptation and so much pulling on the flesh that we have a comforter that can keep us from it if you don't have that hope then then I say you you seek the baptism of a holy ghost with everything that is in you because in the day and age you're living in God will let you fall flat on your face to tell you you are nothing without me the Bible does not say through religion or through a repetition of scripture or some sort of Mind exercise that we can mortify the Deeds of the body but it's only through the spirit that we can mortify the Deeds of the body that means he is my helper in that mortification he is my Aid and my helper in mortifying the Deeds of the body and therefore I have him as my Advocate and he's the one that gives me rest from all these things the Bible says in Matthew chapter 11 verses 28 29 and 30 come unto me all ye that labor all the labor of man is for his mouth all things are full of Labor this come unto me all you that labor those of us who are full-time students or live at home and don't have a job we might say oh well that scripture's when I grow up no this is for those who actually are recognize every day as a toil come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest and then it's just this amazing image take my yoke upon you I don't have the time tonight I'm just going to have to go more quickly through this but take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls it's odd how it speaks on one hand that you are some sort of Beast of Burden who is laboring and heavy laden and then there's this invitation for rest and you're thinking oh I'm going to throw this off and now I'm going to come over here and he's got I got another one for you but he says my yoke is easy and my burden is light so there is a yoke there is a burden but it's only in this that you find rest amen it's in that yoke and that burden where there is true rest and that as it says come unto me and you I'll give you rest it means to refresh means to take ease to cause one to cease and desist from an activity that that draws from their strength that draws from their vigor it means to cease from something to give you to to allow you to recover and collect your strength come unto me yehu laboring and heavy laden cease from this activity so that you can recover and collect strength rest recover that's what addicts do right they go into recovery we need to rest cease from this activity so we can recover our strength it speaks of relieving of the strain of Desire Come Ye that are laboring and heavy laden come and I'll give you rest I'll give you rest from that strain I'll relieve you from the strain of Desire just take your yoke upon me in Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 to 9 it says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving that Thanksgiving is such an important part that with the spirit of gratitude it builds patience and that where you're grateful and you're thankful you're able to endure a lot more he says let your request be made known unto God this is an answer to anxiety this is an answer to restlessness this is a prescription for those who are seeking comfort in things that don't provide it and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus this is an escape from those who are desperately trying to love the things they desperately want if it seems strange to you some of you it'll click and then we'll be singing Take the name of Jesus with you and you'll go ah amen because there's things in our lives that we desperately want but if we're honest we don't even like it let alone love it so what we try to do is we're trying to love the things we want we're trying to love the things that have come by great cost and we've invested so much in we're trying to convince ourselves through cognitive dissonance no I love this I love this I I actually do love this and this is the rest for those who are constantly trying to love the hurtful things they want come unto me through prayer and supplication I could spend much more time on this prayer and this supplication this come having a place where you rest aside from all the demands of life and from that place of rest and that coming aside now that you've secured the time and the place you begin to desire God and I believe that we can find our satisfaction and rest in The Wonder of Christ in The Wonder of the word that's our rest and that's our Focus continue to verse 8 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report they could just think of these things true honest just pure lovely good report these things are so contrary to the synthetic experiences we have these things are real and he says if there be any virtue the strength that there be any praise Or Glory this honor if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things I think I'm hitting my Runway here where we could try to well we're going to be able to end I'm not want you to start the clock or whatever don't get somebody warming up in the bullpen I'm going to finish this one true honest just pure lovely good report are these things he says think on them reckon just as the Bible said and all the multitude of my thoughts and I go seeking after desire and all these things that was talking about before where it's this Reckoning of Mind where the man thinks I reckon I've sought out many inventions I reckon if I do this it'll bring me happiness I reckon that this is the way that it is I reckon I reckon it says hear that think to reckon to account it deals with reality not assumptions it's coming from the root of logos logis oh my it means it deals with realities just as men have sought out many inventions they've reckoned things but it didn't satisfy this is what it reads in the Lexicon if you read it if I think or this logozamai if I reckon my bank has 25 in it it has 25 in it so it says if there be any praise if there be any virtue then think on these things let's reckon on these things because if you're going to meditate on something if you're going to ponder something and think about it if you're going to reckon something then if you say bye I have 25 in the bank if it doesn't have 25 in the bank you've been deceived you're Reckoning is wrong your Reckoning is off so if it doesn't whatever I reckon if I think this will bring me happiness if I think this will bring me peace and it doesn't I've reckoned wrong I've been deceived and so this is the empty promise in the empty vanity of Desire where I and of media and information communication technology we think it's going to make us happy it never has and never will it's created these shallow synthetic experiences of oh I feel like I have some Cloud I feel like I have some value I feel like I have some Prestige you're keeping up with the pretense and it's giving you some shallow social rewards that mean a lot to people but in real genuine long-lasting happiness it's never provided it for anyone think on these things the things that are true and honest just and pure lovely and good report this is the focus I was talking about Focus to bring to focus on something as a verb is to bring something into Focus the noun that point of conversion convergence and the etymology of the word is just very beautiful Focus the point of convergence it comes from the Latin Hearth or fireplace because that would be the point of convergence in a home that would be the place where the family would gather so this word that's used for Focus The Hearth the fireplace it's figurative of family figurative of home with that that have to have that kind of focus when you you bring something to focus as a point of convergence this is the opposite of wonderlust because now you have a hearth you have a fireplace you have a common meeting point a point of convergence that no matter where we've all been and what we've done we have some place in common we have something in common we have some goal it's the opposite of Wunderlist where there is no hope there is no fixed Destiny there is no place that we say this is where we come together and we have common ground that's what church becomes it becomes a focus it becomes a refocusing we come from all the other places that we've been and we can come back to a place like this and say this is where we come together again this is the Earth this is the Gathering point to refocus means to transfer to a center of activity or energy what is that Center true honest pure lovely just good report if there be any you all you know the scripture by heart you've probably already created a nice little post for it that has a nice ring to it this is reality any praise any virtue think on these things we have what I've called the distraction pandemic and it's something that has just rapidly taken over the world it's gone viral like an infectious disease where everyone is distracted we're becoming we're and this distraction comes with the price distracted driving is an activity we often hear about they say any activity a distracted driving would be engaging in any activity that distracts you from the primary job of driving so distracted driving is anything that would deter deter your attention away take your attention away from the task of driving and they said that if you talk on your cell phone or the a person who's impaired with a .08 blood alcohol level is four times more likely uh to have a crash if you're drunk right .08 four times more likely to have a crash than someone who's not drunk it's the same for talking on a cell phone so we're thinking oh man these drunk drivers it's premeditated murder and these guys who drink and drive you know all right talking on the phone increases your chance for an accident just as much as drinking and driving now don't just throw in the towel and start drinking it tells us that the mind is just as impaired as one is intoxicated with a substance as they are when their mind is distracted by a conversation just as likely and they say that if you text while driving it increases the likelihood of a crash up to eight times so talking on the phone is the same as being drunk driving texting you might as well be blackout drunk creases the likelihood eight times this is just with respect to a very dangerous activity that requires our retention I just want to use it as an analogy of just how fragmented our minds have become in our daily activities so this is just what the devil wants us to do get so concerned about all these social things and these media things and these entertainment things and these Sports things because it's going to consume you enough to where you're not paying attention to how you're leading in the home how you're driving your children you're just going to leave it to everybody else to satisfy the needs of those in your lives it comes with the cost and I believe the function and design of laodicea is just to fragment our minds the very function of the very design of it is just to take our attention away from The Wonder of Christ in Jeremiah chapter 6 verse 16 I love the scripture I'm so glad I was able to get to it thus saith the Lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the Old Paths where is the good way I think we need a little bit more some more throwback believer stuff right being those vintages is all the rage right people want things that are vintage why because it's only things that last if there's if there's antique shows in 30 years Ikea is not going to be featured at all right these things aren't going to make it it's the things that were real and had substance and value in these things that they that they used to make with real materials you think that's a couch it's just a hologram couch that they've put in your bedroom you're thinking isn't that a great couch it's like The Emperor's New Clothes with all the things we're buying standing in the ways and see and ask for the Old Paths where is the good way when I say throwback Believers okay maybe vintage Christians I'd rather be an old-time Christian than anything I know to be an old-time Christian you have to let loose at some of this new Time stuff and walk therein and you shall find rest for your souls what a prescription stand in the ways and see ask for the Old Paths where is the good way walk in that and that's what's going to Delight you that's what's going to satisfy that's what's going to bring the stabilization in the home that's what's going to set your mind at ease but it says we will not walk therein I believe it's important for us to find the good path and I say it because as I'm trying to turn the corner here to close I recognize the danger in some of these things that sometimes when we preach Against The Usual Suspects of addiction and pornography and entertainment and movies and all these different things and you preach on it that we could just swap out an unbridled lust for just a real strict legalism and it never satisfies the legalism will never satisfy just going to the ex to another extreme just swapping out addictions isn't going to change you so it's important to find the old path and just not swap out addictions brother Branham says in the sermon he cares do you care he says we find all those things is because people are trying to find Comfort that's why we see the things the accumulation of things and media and multimedia and televisions and entertainments and apps and all these things it's because man's trying to find peace they're trying to find something he says and remember your comfort is your religion and you make those things your religion these things that we're trying to find comfort in the things that we find identity and the things that we find rewards and the things that we seem to be prospering in and finding success in he's saying people are seeking and searching and doing all these things because they're trying to find rest they're trying to find Comfort he says you're whatever you find your comfort in you make it your religion why because religion is used to cover the nakedness your desires producing you run after your desires and you realize I'm still naked you run after your desires you realize you're still naked so you make it a religion to cover yourself up he says your comfort is your religion and you make those things a religion and religion is just a covering so I say just religion is not the answer hold this in your mind let me say this because I trust it's part of the theme of where we may go next religion is very unsafe when we lose sight of Christ here at Christian religion I'll say it this way the message is very unsafe when you lose sight of Christ I'm pausing so you can write it down and you're all just looking at me I hope you remember it because just religion is not the answer just uh spell it out brother and tell me what I can do digital detox help me give me give me give me just tell me straight and I'll do it that's more dangerous because you're in the set you'll take the same the same weakness that caused you to do something habitually you'll transfer it to something that I ask you to do legally and you know better off no closer to Christ I've just swapped places with Apple and Google right and we've come out of Lao to see it and we come into a really strict rigid religious culture and now that's what binds us and satiates right because it's not just religion it's not about finding your place in church and making sure that you have things to do and and giving you all things to make you feel satisfied no I want you to find Christ I I say this and I know it it and maybe it carries with it the risk that you all would leave but my desires that you find Christ and if you have to leave here to find it I'm happy with that because that's the only thing that satisfies and all the years that I've served the Lord and the churches I've served in and the places I've lived and all the things I've done the only thing that is satisfied is Christ that's where I found my peace that's where I found my joy and God help me if I would ever want to drop you a vet that's why I call it not just wonder last and leave it at that but it's Wonder lost because I want you to fall in love with Christ all over again and every time I preach I would that you fall in love with Christ he says in Exodus 33 14 he said my presence shall go with thee and I'll give you rest and let me say there's a lot of singing about his presence I hear the modern worship songs it's all about his presence and you realize they're talking about how they feel when they get together and sing that's the presence that they find beautiful is is the momentum you get with the right chord progression and the right layers and the right sounds and good good writing and a great atmosphere and and the the kind of the hive mentality and the mob mentality listen have a great time and that's what people call the presence but that's not what sums up his presence his presence isn't summed up in religion it's not summed up in worship it's not summed up in the manifestation of the gifts it's more than that there's an outpouring of his Spirit there's gifts of the Spirit there's a moving of the spirit those things are wonderful and and we they ought to we ought to have the Liberty to enjoy them but let's not ever convince ourselves that that's the presence that this message is trying to introduce us to and that's that's that satisfies if I could just make it to church oh oh brother Aaron preaches when he preaches on Wednesday night that's when we really get worked up and we have a little bit more exuberance and and things get the flowing really good I'm gonna get my fix no it's not in that that's not going to be what was satisfying as I've studied this this anchors deep in my heart I say it was so much grace and God helped me to declare it for I feel that I must that we can cover up worldly Desire with charismatic worship and a religious fervor hey bro when I studied the message of the hour time and time again brother Brown's complaint and gets Pentecostalism was their lack of modesty and Holiness in their personal lives and he was uncovering a downside and a detriment to when we leaned to the Pentecostal we leaned to the sensations we leaned to the manifestations brother random told us that's where the passions Run Deep that's where the fussing begins that's where the backbiting is why because that can stimulate the mind and the spirit just as much as the other things and if you're not Anchored In Christ you can use charismatic worship you can use shouting and dancing in the manifestation I guess to cover worldliness at home and a lack of modesty and thinking and it's happened for the hundreds of years when I said this religion becomes unsafe when we lose sight of Christ we could become addicted in unhealthy ways to religious activities it may it never be that this church causes you to do anything unhealthy whether it be by requiring of you service or giving you opportunities and find ways that that you could feel satisfied know it in Christ first if you want to fill up all the time in the day just just ask the trustees there's a there's a job to do if you want a busy yourself for religious things and things that have to do with the church and things that have to do with missions that we could find something for you to do but if it's not a conduit For the Love of Christ that's bound up in your heart if it's not coming from a safe place because you love the Lord and this is something you believe then there's many unhealthy things we can give ourselves to you say where's this coming from I could preach against the wonderlust and get your attention and you try to move yourself away from the world but let's not run to something else that's doubly worse let's run to him find him in our as our joy fight him as our Outlet because we can come we can become addicted addicted in unhealthy ways to church activities and religious things and our hearts are bound in a prison if church and religious activity become our sole focus of safety and our sole focus of rest God help us to let that may that not be where we find our rest is it it were prisoners if the sole focus of our worship to God and the sole focus of our safety and our rest is bound up in some in church I didn't understand why I had this quote at this point but it sure makes a lot more sense now how many have ever read or listened to the sermon the invasion of the United States I don't know some of you are thinking that sounds like a good movie but brother Brown preached it in 1954. and he was talking about Satan has moved his seat from Europe and it's in Hollywood read it today with an eye to what exists today it's such prophecy and he was warning in other words you think this is bad it's invading and he says don't feel angry at me you just remember that I'm preaching to you I want to preach this as if this was the last sermon I'd ever preach in my life I want to preach every sermon I preach as if I was a dying man preaching to dying men and I am my light's burning down every day yours is too we're dying Mortals and we've got to face the Living God some of these days and we better be in deep sincerity about this and and I failed to go back and listen to it because the way it's transcribed when you listen to it it's like he's saying it's not in this and just in a glamor and carrying on and join the church and go here and there act this way in that way we better be serious about this sober about this just carrying on joining Church going here and there act this way in that way no thought to it we better have old-fashioned prayer meetings in our homes and crying out to God day and night this is a 1954. the day is at hand a time of distress a time of trouble the Bible said a dark day and we're living in it if I could say this I know this might seem just to be a little bit odd as I say this but this is coming from the source of what I've been looking at looking from the message of the hours I focused on this lately what he's admonished them to cry out for we've received what brother Branham was doing in his early Ministry and what he thought he was laying a foundation for and what he was preaching he was building up to the very things the message brought us and he was tell him to cry out and the Very things they cried out he was telling him to cry out for we received well because the rest isn't even in the crime it's in the vindication man let me say there's a rest for God's elect there's a proper yoke come unto me I say let's not be lulled into the numbness it's like a blanket of a Darkness over us it's a cloak we can feel it let's not be numbed he says in Galatians 5 1 Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ hath made us free there's still some more things to share tonight just hold on with me it's 8 35 stand therefore in the Liberty where Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage the Yoke of bondage would be anything that hinders anything that Masters you anything that directs you you that are bound up and yoked up with something and you're being driven like an ox to do somebody else's bidding you're being driven to plow somebody else's field you're doing driven to do something that's going to benefit somebody else take it off put my yoke on you it says let's Stand Fast and The Liberty where Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage I say to you if your families have found rest in these things if you're finding respite from the ever presence of media and entertainment and YouTube and all these other things if you're finding ways to get distance from it I say Stand Fast in the Liberty true Liberty is living as we ought to not as we want to I know that may not make a lot of sense to the world but true Liberty is living as you ought to not as you want to free from the desires of the flesh not just giving into my whims not just giving into will I feel this way or will I Want It That Way true Liberty is living as one ought to amen that's the fallacy of the Democracy they're trying to sell us now is that in Liberty and people's rights and letting people do what they want that's not real Liberty real Liberty is doing what you ought to do that's our liberties Christians as living righteously to be righteous is to be as you ought to be I say righteous living is preferred to riotous living I'll say this too the ought to is where Real Love Is let me say this Micah you there'll be me days you may not want to but you always ought to love your wife there may be days when you don't feel it there may be times when it's really hard but there's never a moment when you shouldn't does it not make sense to you there may be days when it's hard but you know that you always ought to in Liberty is doing as you ought to that's where the Love Is you may not feel it it may not be what's immediate in your mind there's enough dumbing down of our minds there's enough layers of complexities and broken hearts and relationships and things that compile onto somebody where we could find a complex that won't allow us to break through and it's not doing what you want it's doing what you ought that'll allow you to break through the very things that restrain and bind up love that's in our hearts it's where real living can be found to live and wonder not driven by desire are you okay with this brother Brandon quotes often from the Psalm of Life it's a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow I don't know why we always call him by his full name it just seems to be what they do but it's a poem about the purpose of life and how to handle struggles and it's brother Brown says I love it it tells something it manifests something it's got real something into it some meanings program's attitude towards it and the whole poem opens up with the rebuttal to a listener who from the as you read it it appears as if he's explained Life As a matter of numbers and figures it's a formula it's the algorithm it's the matrix it's the mind this is the way that we live this is the way that you can rig life and figure it out and life is all about stats and statistics and life is science and figures and all these things it says it's a rebuttal but this is the phrase that brother Branham in if you think oh my goodness how long is he going to preach I'm wondering the same thing this this is this is what I'm wanting to end with with this thought brother Brown refers to over and over again this coming to me this week be not like dumb driven cattle and brother bam talks about it how they're being driven and talks about how they're driven but be not like dumb driven cattle are you familiar with brother I'm quoting it over and over again think about what the dumb driven cattle being done they're blindly they're walking blindly towards their own death dumb driven cattle being driven to the death by those who stand to gain from their death this is the image that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow can I just call him Longfellow for sake of brevity this is what he has in his mind as he's writing this and he's writing about the purpose of life and the struggles of life and even the momentum of things that can happen in life and he says don't be like dumb driven cattle that you're just being driven even if it's just this driving force walking blindly towards your own destruction he's saying fight back fight back against those who are hurting me like cattle fight back against those who are corralling you and using you again for your own demise and for their benefit and in the Psalm of Life it's asking the question is life really worthless is life a worthless imaginary fantasy and I wonder how is it that we can avoid this Faith fate how is it in this this life that we're in now this biblical life this battle that we're in right now how is it that we're going to somehow rise out of it Shake ourselves and stay connected with things that matter and give us real living how are we going to break free Longfellow cells tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream for the soul is dead that Slumbers and things are not what they seem life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal Dost thou art to dust that returnist was not spoken of the Soul not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined in their way but to act then each tomorrow find us farther than today this is relevant not enjoyment and sorrow that's not our Destiny or in but to act and that each tomorrow find us further than today art is long and time is fleeting according from Hippocrates this the skill it takes a long time to inquire things it takes a long time to achieve but time is so short and our hearts those Stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the Grave it's the world's broad field of battle in the Bible Book of Life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife in this broad field of battle in this greatest battle of the Mind in this bivoc of life let us not be like dumb driven cattle be a hero in the strife and others fight back in fact it aspires to do anything is to fight back against this onslaught trust no future however pleasant Let the dead past bury it's dead not beautiful how he did that trust no future how pleasant it might seem Let the dead pass bury its dead act in the living present heart within and God overhead lives of Great Men all remind us we can make our lives Sublime and departing leave behind his footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing or life saw the main a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother seen shall take heart again let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait musicians if he'd come brother Bradham takes this poem and he reads apart and he ends the sermon God's power of transformation he's in it with the colonies he's asking some just to give their heart to the Lord and respond and can I could I ask you to search your hearts now and as we read this quote it's a lengthy quote but I want you to think of how that brother Branham is charging speaking this to these people and it's a prayer and he's just it and it's so striking he says Dear God they're yours I've seen two men stand to their feet father I pray God that you'll take them now they want to be your sons these men that are standing and it's remarkable to think that that these these these men in this sermon preached right here in Phoenix there's just two in a sermon like this just two and this is what he continues to say now think about ourselves they have woke up from the ignorance of the life that they have lived and now they want to be afreshed a nude with the baptism of the Holy Spirit upon that seed that's been planted in their hearts this day this is what I pray for us that we can wake up from the ignorance of this life be a fresh and renewed rest refocus Eternal God the Creed of all things who made your word and I believe that you knew these men would do this this morning I pray Lord that you will water that word day and night and never let Satan to pluck it from your hands may it be a tree that sometimes in the paradise of God when it's all brought back again for your word cannot fill it'll be again likening their lives to be in a tree of life [Music] let it be that tree in the paradise of God say then there will not be this kind of civilization in the world to come there will be no automobiles or nothing that science has ever done there'll be no such things in the world that is to come but it'll be God's Own type of civilization that he'll set up in the Glorious ring for in this civilization there is sickness death sorrow graze and want but in that Kingdom that is to come there is no death no sorrow no sickness no old age oh God it'll be new there in your civilization my heart pulsating to this as I read it today be not like dumb driven cattle be not like dumb driven cattle he says God transform us today by your power by the renewing of our mind to turn from the meager elements of this world now unto the word of God that's all these things the world can offer you are meager elements and may we be renewed by the transforming power of God upon the seed that is in our heart that we believe and the creatures called Sons and Daughters of God this is my prayer for you to you father for the people in Jesus name amen could this be your prayer tonight that God would transform us by the renewing of our minds from the meager elements of this world I pray for you rest and refocus may God grant it in our individual lives of personal lives I think of the young men that are living and their singlehood in this day and age and maybe retreat to their homes or their apartments by themselves alone to the young couples trying to make a way in this world to the families raising children the fearful thoughts of raising no matter where we are in life we need him we need that Solitude we need that quietness we need the Stillness and I I just sum up this series on wonderlust and wonder lost I say rest cease and desist from the activity that's draining you so that you can recover strength and then refocus on the word because that's what will transform us could we stand together tonight
