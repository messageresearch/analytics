[0:00] Paul and Timoththeus, the servants of
[0:02] Jesus Christ, to all the saints in
[0:04] Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi,
[0:07] with the bishops and deacons. Grace be
[0:10] unto you and peace from God our Father
[0:12] and from the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank
[0:14] my God upon every remembrance of you
[0:17] always in every prayer of mine for you
[0:19] all making request with joy for your
[0:21] fellowship in the gospel from the first
[0:23] day until now. What what writing just
[0:26] rich beautiful words. He says, "Being
[0:28] confident of this very thing, that he
[0:30] which hath begun a good work in you will
[0:34] perform it until the day of Jesus
[0:36] Christ, even as it meat for me to think
[0:39] this is of you all, to think this of you
[0:42] all, because I have you in my heart. In
[0:44] as much as both in my bonds and in the
[0:46] defense and confirmation of the gospel,
[0:47] ye are ye all are partakers of my grace.
[0:51] For God is my record. How greatly I long
[0:53] after you all in the bowels of Jesus
[0:56] Christ." And this I pray, that your love
[1:00] may abound yet more and more in
[1:02] knowledge and in all judgment, that ye
[1:05] may approve things that are excellent,
[1:08] that you may be sincere. And that's
[1:09] where my focus is today is on this word
[1:12] sincere. That you may be sincere and
[1:14] without offense till the day of Christ,
[1:16] being filled with the fruits of
[1:18] righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ
[1:20] unto the glory and praise of God. Amen.
[1:24] Man, what what a writer he was. You can
[1:27] be seated.
[1:29] My title today is unwaxed. I found
[1:32] myself using this as a working title and
[1:35] even entitling the service today that uh
[1:38] for some reason unwaxed kept coming to
[1:40] my mind and maybe it was a little bit
[1:41] triggering uh but unwaxed is the word
[1:45] that we're using for our title. It may
[1:47] seem a little bit unique and you may
[1:49] allow your mind wonder, but the imagery
[1:51] is meant to draw you to what is intended
[1:54] behind this is that has something to do
[1:56] with uh clay and pottery as we were
[1:59] using on uh this past service on earth
[2:02] and vessels. If you could look at 2
[2:04] Corinthians chapter 3:1 18, we'll just
[2:07] start um we'll start right here in uh
[2:10] here. And if I need to, brother Joshua,
[2:13] grab another microphone, just let me
[2:14] know. I notice there's some drops, but
[2:16] you keep working as you're doing, I'm
[2:18] not bothered by it at all, but to the
[2:20] extent that I need to change, just let
[2:21] me know. Verse 18, in 2 Corinthians
[2:24] 3:18, it says, "But we all with open
[2:27] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[2:30] of the Lord, are changed into the same
[2:32] image from glory to glory, even as by
[2:35] the spirit of the Lord." We are
[2:38] privileged now to be looking into the
[2:39] word of God. This Bible has become a new
[2:41] book. Therefore, when we looking into
[2:43] the word of God, we're actually seeing
[2:45] him with greater clarity and a greater
[2:47] intensity. And so, as we behold the Lord
[2:50] in this glass, Paul using this phrase
[2:53] glass wants us to think about the fact
[2:55] that when we see Christ, we should see
[2:57] ourselves.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe not as we are, but what we can
[3:00] become. So, he says we're changed into
[3:03] that. So, what we're beholding has power
[3:06] to change what others behold in us. So
[3:08] by beholding Christ's beauty uh our
[3:11] characters transformed into Christ's
[3:13] image by the word even as by the spirit
[3:16] of the Lord as it says here we use the
[3:19] example in Exodus how that Moses's face
[3:21] radiated with God's glory and this was
[3:24] the when he met with God and communed
[3:26] with God there was this visible evidence
[3:28] of God's presence after having met with
[3:31] him and it was so radiant that he he
[3:34] actually veiled his face before the
[3:36] people uh because it it was something
[3:39] that shook them, something they couldn't
[3:41] quite comprehend. And so Paul is using
[3:44] that as an example of how that well,
[3:46] when Moses stood before the people,
[3:48] there was a veil over his face so that
[3:50] the people couldn't see his glory, but
[3:52] when he returned back into the presence
[3:54] of God, he took the veil off so that
[3:56] that it could be face to face. And Paul
[3:59] is using that as an example of how that
[4:02] communion with God changes your image.
[4:05] But yet, if there's a veil in the way,
[4:08] then it keeps the the presence of God
[4:10] from impacting you. And the veil will
[4:12] keep you from seeing God's presence. And
[4:14] he's pointing out how that the veil kept
[4:16] Israel from seeing the glory of God in
[4:19] the prophet.
[4:21] Follow me? That there was a veil over
[4:24] Moses's face to cover the glory of God
[4:26] that was in the prophet. And so, it's
[4:29] the same thing today. A veil Paul
[4:32] keeping Israel from recognizing and
[4:34] knowing God even as it was in Moses.
[4:37] They couldn't see it in Christ. And veil
[4:40] hides his glory.
[4:44] Is it getting worse?
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Which one do you want me to grab? I
[4:47] prefer maze or blue.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; Okay, good. Praise the Lord. That's a
[4:51] sign. I don't know if you knew this, but
[4:53] in The Chosen, that uh great gospel
[4:58] series that you can all binge as
[5:00] families, Jesus chose blue when he chose
[5:03] what he was going to wear over the
[5:05] scarlet and whatever else was in there.
[5:07] He chose blue.
[5:09] So Paul's saying we all with open face
[5:13] can see the glory of the Lord and it
[5:14] changes us. The veil is what keeps us
[5:16] from seeing his glory. And the verse
[5:19] picks up in chapter uh chapter 4 verse
[5:22] one. But then as you continue to read in
[5:23] verse 7, but we have this treasure in
[5:25] earth and vessels. You are the earth and
[5:28] vessel. You're this vessel of clay. And
[5:30] you have a treasure in it that the
[5:32] excellency of the power may be of God
[5:34] and not of us. What's the treasure in
[5:37] the earth and vessel? His glory.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; That's what uh that is what the treasure
[5:42] is. A treasure is what's things laid up
[5:45] in a treasury. So then you are the
[5:47] treasury and the treasure that's in the
[5:49] treasury is the glory of the Lord.
[5:51] You're a clay vessel that holds the
[5:54] glory of God and that actually if you're
[5:56] holding the glory of God then you reveal
[5:57] it. You're a source of the sunlight is
[6:00] what we used on Wednesday. And so God
[6:02] has I want you to start thinking of it
[6:04] in this way and this is where my mind
[6:06] has been going as we've been on this
[6:08] subject of art. There's different
[6:09] artistry
[6:11] and there's different fields of art.
[6:12] We've been thinking about this process
[6:14] of forming clay into something useful.
[6:18] And so God has formed clay for the
[6:20] purpose of himself dwelling inside of
[6:23] you. And a potter that's one that's an
[6:26] artist who works with clay. Uh the
[6:29] ceramicist is something that some people
[6:31] say and they say, "Are you a
[6:32] ceramicist?" And I said, "No, and I'm
[6:34] not a narcissist either."
[6:36] But in Job 10:es 8 and N says, "Thy
[6:40] hands have made me and fashioned me
[6:43] together round about yet thou dost
[6:46] destroy me. Remember I beseech thee that
[6:49] thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt
[6:52] thou bring me into dust again?" And and
[6:55] what's being expressed here is that God,
[6:58] he's saying, God, you form me as a
[7:00] potter would form a vessel of clay. And
[7:03] in making that clay, God, the potter has
[7:06] absolute power over it, that he can make
[7:09] it whatever he wants it to be. And at
[7:11] any moment, he has power to tear it back
[7:14] down again or to cast it aside. So this
[7:16] thigh, your hands have made me and
[7:18] fashioned me as a potter would the clay.
[7:22] Uh ceramics is maybe the term that's
[7:24] used for the the general uh area of art
[7:28] or the genre of art. It's the art of
[7:30] making objects from clay, earthn wear,
[7:33] stone wear or porcelain. Those are
[7:35] different things that are done. But you
[7:36] have an an artist, an artisan who will
[7:39] take the clay and fashion it into
[7:42] something, an object. It may just be for
[7:44] the purpose of art, but us most usually
[7:47] these artisans were making something for
[7:49] daily use to hold something and for some
[7:52] utility. And so Job drawing from this
[7:55] labor of someone fashioning the the
[7:58] earth and clay into an object, he says,
[8:00] "God, you've made me in the same way."
[8:03] Jeremiah 18 verse 6. And those first
[8:05] five verses of this chapter would be
[8:07] good for you to go back and read. Oh
[8:09] house of Israel, can I not do with you
[8:11] as as this potter? Sayaith the Lord,
[8:14] behold, as the clay is in the potter's
[8:16] hand, so are ye in my hand, oh house of
[8:19] Israel.
[8:21] This is God now liking himself to a
[8:23] potter. He's saying, "As I deal with
[8:25] Israel as a nation, you should think of
[8:27] it in the sense of Israel being this
[8:29] lump of clay and I'm the one that's
[8:32] fashioning it and forming it." And
[8:34] that's the same way that Job looked at
[8:35] himself as an individual. I think that's
[8:37] how we ought to look at ourselves. God
[8:39] even himself uses this artist of a
[8:42] ceramicist, as a potter, as being an
[8:45] image of what he does. And so God using
[8:48] this example of a potter working with
[8:50] clay, he's using it to describe the work
[8:52] that he does in us, the work that he's
[8:55] doing for us. So if you look at where we
[8:58] were in our text in Philippians chapter
[8:59] 1, I know you're probably already trying
[9:02] to figure out in your mind, how is he
[9:04] going to get to wax? Well, we'll get
[9:05] there. In Philippians chapter 1, we'll
[9:08] read just verses 6, 7, and 8. For now,
[9:10] and then pick up in verse 9 here in a
[9:12] moment. being confident of this very
[9:14] thing, that he which hath begun a good
[9:16] work in you will perform it or perfect
[9:19] it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; So God is likens himself. He says, I I'm
[9:25] like a potter who's at the will forming
[9:29] clay. And that's the work that he's
[9:31] doing. He's taking these materials,
[9:33] these raw materials, these natural
[9:35] materials, which you are in your flesh,
[9:37] and he's saying, "I am forming it. I'm
[9:39] fashioning it. these things even of your
[9:41] spirit and your soul. God is as a potter
[9:44] working with you. He says, "I've started
[9:45] this. I will perfect it."
[9:47] &gt;&gt; And I want you to think of it this way.
[9:49] Not just finish it. Say, "Well, I'm
[9:51] done." It's kind of like some of these
[9:53] competitions where five, four, three,
[9:56] two, one, hands off and you're finished.
[9:58] No matter no matter if it is complete,
[10:01] he's done. No, he's saying, "I will
[10:03] complete it.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Whatever it takes, I will perfect it.
[10:07] Even as it is meat for me to think this
[10:08] of you all, because I have you in my
[10:11] heart, in as much as both in my bonds
[10:13] and in that defense and confirmation of
[10:15] the gospel, ye all are partakers of my
[10:17] grace, even this labor that Paul
[10:20] submitted himself to a and ministering
[10:22] the word of God. He says, "We're all
[10:24] partakers in this because he has from
[10:25] one lump made us. For God is my record.
[10:28] How greatly, how long after you all in
[10:30] the bowels of Jesus Christ." So this
[10:33] Paul is describing and he's associating
[10:36] himself with this great work that God is
[10:38] doing in the believer. And this work
[10:40] which God has started he will finish. In
[10:43] Isaiah 29:16, surely your turning of
[10:46] things upside down shall be esteemed as
[10:49] the potter's clay. You'll recognize Paul
[10:52] picking up on this theme in Romans. For
[10:54] shall the work say of him that made it,
[10:56] he made me not.
[10:59] The clay doesn't form itself. It doesn't
[11:00] make itself. So the clay having been
[11:03] fashioned into something cannot look to
[11:06] the very hands that formed it and say,
[11:07] "Well, you didn't make me." Or shall the
[11:10] thing framed say of him that framed it,
[11:12] "He had no understanding."
[11:14] So who is it? Who's the maid to reply to
[11:17] God, "You don't know what you're doing."
[11:20] Let me help you out here. And again,
[11:21] it's this image of something being
[11:23] formed out of clay, an earthn vessel.
[11:27] Isaiah 64:8 says it this way very
[11:30] beautifully. But now, oh Lord, thou art
[11:32] our father.
[11:33] We are the clay, and thou are thou our
[11:36] potter, and we all are the work of thy
[11:39] hand. God uses himself as a potter
[11:44] working with the earth, with clay. Now,
[11:46] our reply to God is, you are our father.
[11:49] And then in this image of a potter
[11:51] working with the clay, we are the clay.
[11:54] You are the one that's fashioning this
[11:56] clay. You're the one that has a vision.
[11:57] You're the one with the understanding.
[11:59] And so therefore we are the work of your
[12:01] hand. This is the image that Paul is
[12:03] drawing from when that this you will
[12:05] perform it until the day of Jesus
[12:07] Christ. Philippians 1 vers9. And this I
[12:10] pray that your love may abound yet more
[12:13] and more in knowledge and in all
[12:16] judgment. I'll just read to verse 11
[12:18] then we'll come back to this. That ye
[12:20] may approve things that are excellent.
[12:22] that you may be sincere and without
[12:24] offense till the day of Christ, being
[12:26] filled with the fruits of righteousness
[12:28] which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory
[12:31] and praise of God. This is a mouthful.
[12:34] There's so much here. So this that you
[12:36] may abound yet more and more in
[12:40] knowledge and in all judgment. And it's
[12:42] your love that may abound. So this
[12:44] abounding love, notice how that it
[12:46] manifests. manifest in a more
[12:48] comprehensive and a more complete
[12:50] knowledge of God and discernment by that
[12:53] knowledge. Do you realize the more that
[12:55] you know about God and his word, the
[12:56] more you know about everything?
[12:58] &gt;&gt; So when some people say they know
[13:00] everything or they act like they know
[13:01] everything, just start getting into the
[13:02] word to find out how much they really
[13:04] know. Because the more you know about
[13:06] God, the more you know about everything.
[13:08] That may be a risky proposition to throw
[13:10] out there, but I hope you could kind of
[13:12] extrapolate from that. you know what my
[13:14] point would be and the the ultimate uh
[13:17] logic behind that, but that he's saying
[13:19] your love would express itself in the
[13:23] knowledge that you have in the way that
[13:24] you use that knowledge to discern.
[13:27] And he speaks of this growth, this
[13:29] abounding. It speaks of a growth which
[13:31] strengthens your spiritual sense. Not
[13:34] your natural abilities necessarily or
[13:37] not that you're going to get taller or
[13:39] thinner or or stronger, but you have the
[13:41] spiritual sense to know. Oh, and he uses
[13:43] the phrase, excellent things. Isn't that
[13:45] what we want? We want to know excellent
[13:46] things. Things that excel. Not only good
[13:50] things, but the best of things. Not just
[13:52] what suffices, but what satisfies that
[13:55] what what is actually good in the eyes
[13:57] of God. And this superior excellence
[14:01] that he's referring to and that he's
[14:02] talking about these excellent things,
[14:05] they're they're they're hardly
[14:07] discerned, rarely discerned except by
[14:09] mature Christians that it's not you're
[14:12] not stumbling into something and then
[14:14] getting lucky. But these excellent
[14:15] things are something that a mature
[14:17] Christian hones in on. Can look at a
[14:20] situation or feel something and begin to
[14:22] think about their experience and what
[14:24] God has shown them. And they say, I
[14:25] their experience is a great teacher.
[14:27] Therefore, our experiences with God
[14:29] should teach us something.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; And as we have more experiences in his
[14:33] presence, if we had uh church services
[14:36] or special meetings and there's a
[14:37] dynamic move of God and that experience
[14:40] of his presence and the stirring in our
[14:42] souls and maybe we cry and whether we
[14:45] dance or the gifts manifest themselves,
[14:47] that's an experience in the presence of
[14:48] God. And what we should do is learn from
[14:50] that so that it causes us to grow and to
[14:54] propel us forward. Not create this
[14:55] dynamic where we think that that's the
[14:58] ultimate and that's what we long for, we
[15:00] want to come back to. That's akin to a
[15:02] drug addict.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; That's akin to somebody who has an
[15:05] eating disorder that they eat in order
[15:07] because they can't. They want to just uh
[15:09] they just want to taste it. They want to
[15:10] taste it. Want to taste it and then they
[15:12] get obese. We don't want to be
[15:13] spiritually obese.
[15:15] And that's what can happen when we're
[15:17] when we're not growing from our
[15:18] experiences and learning from our
[15:20] experiences.
[15:21] And so there's this superior excellence
[15:24] that is discerned by a mature Christian.
[15:27] One of the phrases that I'm drawing from
[15:29] in this is that when something is
[15:31] waxing,
[15:33] it's increasing. Find a scripture often
[15:35] referring to strength or age. Waxing old
[15:38] or waxing great in strength. A waxing
[15:41] moon is one that's increasing. A waning
[15:43] moon is one that's decreasing. And to
[15:45] wax is to grow bigger or greater, to
[15:47] increase. So he's saying that your love
[15:50] may wax more and more.
[15:54] And I'm already causing you to flip
[15:55] things around and think, well, but then
[15:57] we're what's unwaxed?
[16:00] In Hebrews 5:14, it says, "Strong meat
[16:03] belong to them that are full age,
[16:04] mature, who can handle it? Even those
[16:07] who by reason of use experience have
[16:10] their senses exercised to discern both
[16:13] good and evil. This is partly what Paul
[16:17] is referring to that if our love abounds
[16:19] yet more and more in all knowledge and
[16:21] in all judgment or discernment, then
[16:23] we're able to approve things that are
[16:25] excellent. We've matured. We've grown.
[16:27] And we've had our senses exercised. And
[16:29] experience with God. and the application
[16:31] of the word in our lives has caused us
[16:33] to wax to a point to where we handle
[16:36] situations differently than we've ever
[16:38] handled them before. It's been here
[16:39] before. I've done it wrong before, but
[16:41] now I've learned my lesson. I know how
[16:43] to treat this or address this. And so,
[16:45] we're maturing and by reason of use, we
[16:48] can judge properly.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; We read in in John chapter 3 21, we've
[16:54] been reading these scriptures as of
[16:56] late. But he that doeth truth cometh to
[16:58] the light,
[17:00] that his deeds may be made manifest,
[17:02] that they are wrought in God. So this is
[17:05] the power of light. This is the power of
[17:08] discernment and judgment. We come to the
[17:10] light so that the light can judge us.
[17:13] This is the power of being in God's
[17:14] presence. This is the power of even
[17:16] having our senses exercised by
[17:18] experiencing the word of God by our love
[17:20] abounding more and more in knowledge and
[17:22] all judgment. We come to the light that
[17:24] our deeds, our thoughts, our actions,
[17:26] our lives can be examined by the light.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Then Paul building on that in Ephesians
[17:32] chapter 5:es 8 to13 I believe building
[17:34] on this principle says ye were sometimes
[17:36] darkness but now are ye light in the
[17:39] Lord. Walk as children of the light.
[17:42] In thy light we shall see the light.
[17:45] It's when you're in the light of God
[17:46] that you actually know what light is.
[17:49] Says for the fruit of the spirit is all
[17:50] goodness and righteousness and truth.
[17:52] This is what ought to be coming from us
[17:54] as vessels. Proving what is acceptable
[17:57] unto the Lord. Now we are our lives
[18:00] become the proof. Proving what is
[18:02] acceptable under the Lord and have no
[18:04] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[18:05] darkness, but rather reprove them. Now
[18:08] you're the reprover. Now are you light.
[18:11] If we come to the light that our deeds
[18:13] may be reproved or may be examined, then
[18:17] therefore when we become light, we have
[18:20] the capacity to reprove. So we don't
[18:22] have fellowship with the evil works of
[18:24] darkness, but rather we reprove them. We
[18:26] expose them. For it is a shame even to
[18:28] speak of those things which are done of
[18:29] them in secret. But all things that are
[18:32] reproved are made manifest by the light.
[18:35] For whatsoever doth make manifest is
[18:37] light.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; So therefore now you are light in the
[18:39] Lord. We become light to reprove and
[18:42] approve. We've been made light so that
[18:45] we don't continue in darkness so that we
[18:47] can identify darkness. We can identify
[18:49] light and then walk as children of light
[18:51] in the light.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; This is a beautiful picture that's
[18:57] painted throughout these scriptures. So
[18:58] therefore, we are to approve excellent
[19:00] things by the light, the understanding,
[19:03] the wisdom that is in us.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus says, if the light that is
[19:07] in thee be darkness, how great is that
[19:08] darkness? because then your
[19:09] understanding approves darkness is light
[19:12] and that's error. Woe unto him who does
[19:15] that. So Paul says that we may approve
[19:18] things that are excellent that we may be
[19:20] sincere and without offense till the day
[19:22] of Christ. Now that is quite a challenge
[19:25] to be unoffensive.
[19:27] And I know that some may immediately
[19:30] begin to think of a woke mind virus
[19:34] right that plagues people where we don't
[19:36] want to offend anyone. That's not what's
[19:37] being spoken of here. But he's speaking
[19:40] of an inward sincerity that you may be
[19:43] sincere. This is a single eye to the
[19:45] word. The sincerity speaks of a pure
[19:47] heart. This th this is what we should be
[19:50] desiring. This is the focus of what I
[19:52] mean by unwaxed something pure. It it
[19:54] ties back to uh the mixed media and some
[19:58] of those things we've been speaking on.
[19:59] The thing the poisons, the things that
[20:00] contaminate the le the leavenven in our
[20:02] spirits. This is an inward sincerity
[20:05] where you have a single eye to the word.
[20:07] You're not double-minded. There's no
[20:09] double- tongedness. You have a pure
[20:10] heart. And not just an inward sincerity,
[20:13] but an outward outwardly unoffensive
[20:17] where you're holy and unblameable. Where
[20:20] outwardly unoffensive means outwardly
[20:22] you don't offend the word.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Because we have this attitude, well,
[20:26] it's what's in the heart that counts.
[20:28] And in my heart is love and in my heart
[20:30] is peace. But outwardly I'm a murderer.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Right. outwardly I stir things up. It's
[20:34] like, but you know what? I know I killed
[20:36] those people, but in my heart I loved
[20:38] them and and and I'm sincere in my
[20:42] heart. And there's a
[20:45] a a lie. I know that's maybe an extreme
[20:47] example, but I use it so that we can
[20:48] begin to think maybe more practically of
[20:50] how that this idea of what's in the
[20:52] heart counts alone without it being
[20:55] outwardly manifested.
[20:58] What Paul is saying is that what what is
[21:00] unoffensive outwardly speaks of what is
[21:02] pure inwardly that we would be holy and
[21:05] unblameable filled with fruits of
[21:07] righteousness.
[21:09] This unoffensive or without offense. It
[21:12] means not striking against or stumbling.
[21:15] And it has a a meaning in the Greek
[21:17] which is very beautiful. So let me put
[21:18] it this way that you may be sincere and
[21:20] without offense means that you will
[21:22] become pure and smooth.
[21:25] Smooth. Would you like that? Isn't that
[21:27] what we all want to be? Suave, right? We
[21:31] want to be smooth.
[21:33] That you may be sincere and without
[21:35] offense. Pure and smooth.
[21:38] The word sincere in the the Greek here
[21:40] means unsullied or unmixed,
[21:43] unadulterated,
[21:45] found pure. This is this is the meaning
[21:47] behind it. the sincere and the and the
[21:49] joining together of these words uh that
[21:52] are that are used in the in the Greek it
[21:56] says found pure when unfolded and
[21:59] examined by the sun's light.
[22:03] The word literally means judged by
[22:05] sunlight.
[22:07] We've already looked at in the scripture
[22:08] how God is going to judge all things by
[22:10] Jesus Christ. He's going to judge the
[22:12] world by his son Jesus.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Judgment comes by the son. As the
[22:16] father's judged, I have judged. There's
[22:18] a standard. Jesus Christ is going to
[22:20] judge the world. And so this word and
[22:22] then we are judged by the light. And
[22:24] then when the light is in us, we judge
[22:27] by the light. We approve things that are
[22:29] excellence. We re we reprove things that
[22:31] are dark. It means to be judged by the
[22:33] sunlight. The the two uh words are the
[22:36] prefix and the suffix is Haley. The
[22:39] sun's ray. Literally the sun's ray is
[22:42] what the the sun the the sin seir is the
[22:45] sun's ray in kro which is judge or to
[22:48] determine or to decree.
[22:50] It's what mean to if something's sincere
[22:52] it's tested as genuine.
[22:55] So to be sincere it means pure unmixed
[22:57] unadulterated free from pretense or
[22:59] falsehood.
[23:01] Something sincere it's whole. It's
[23:03] intact.
[23:05] If we were to use this phrase today and
[23:07] just look it up in our dictionary and
[23:09] and right under uh right in the same
[23:11] listing in our dictionary of brain rot
[23:14] and 67 as they've made these over the
[23:16] last few years these are words of the
[23:17] year and how in the world these these
[23:20] become official words. It's amazing. But
[23:23] sincerity means the virtue of one who
[23:25] communicates and acts according to the
[23:28] entirety of their feelings, beliefs,
[23:30] thoughts, and desires in a manner that's
[23:32] honest and genuine.
[23:35] It's a mouthful, but think of it. The
[23:37] virtue of one who communicates
[23:40] in a way that's consistent with the way
[23:41] they feel.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; One who acts in a way that fits their
[23:47] beliefs. Notice it to be sincere, the
[23:50] the opposite of that would be
[23:51] hypocritical.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Someone's honest and genuine. That they
[23:54] say what they're thinking. And it I'm
[23:56] not advocating for not having any
[23:58] filter, but what I would say is that if
[24:00] if saying something would offend
[24:02] unnecessarily or be literally hurtful or
[24:04] contrary to the word of God, filter,
[24:07] right? But if someone says I I if you if
[24:11] you're going to say something and say,
[24:12] "Are you okay? Did I offend you?" And
[24:14] you're like, "Oh, no. I'm fine,
[24:18] you dirty devil." Right? That that
[24:20] there's a certain way where you're not
[24:22] being sincere. that that if if someone
[24:24] wants to know there's a way perhaps you
[24:26] could communicate which is which aligns
[24:29] with how you're actually feeling. I've
[24:31] given been given a lot of thought to
[24:33] this as I've mentioned before I've been
[24:35] studying on the thought of community and
[24:38] the scripture I've been drawing from is
[24:39] they have all things in common. So, I'm
[24:42] trying to do the math that how many cars
[24:44] do we have of a certain type that the
[24:47] the rest of us can just sell ours and
[24:49] buy uh what everybody else is driving
[24:51] and the fewer fewer people are impacted
[24:53] that way. So, I'm just trying to do the
[24:54] math. We can have all things in common.
[24:57] But there is certainly a
[24:58] misunderstanding of what that means. So,
[24:59] I've been thinking a lot about
[25:00] relationships within community, what it
[25:02] means to have all things things in
[25:03] common. And I I was realizing this that
[25:06] when people are sincere,
[25:08] sincere people are more comfortable to
[25:11] be around.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; And the reason why is sincere people
[25:15] communicate and act in a way that's
[25:17] consistent with how they're feeling.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Um I was fellow with brother Joshua um
[25:21] the other the other week and we're
[25:23] fellowshipping and he made the comment.
[25:24] He says he he's people usually
[25:26] misunderstand him and they don't know
[25:27] what he means. And I was thinking, man,
[25:29] I've always felt like I've connected and
[25:30] understood where you're coming from. And
[25:32] I said, "I'm starting to rethink our
[25:33] five years fiveyear relationship. Maybe
[25:36] I haven't understood you. Maybe I didn't
[25:38] know what you meant." And we we were
[25:40] laughing and having fun with that. But
[25:42] the the point is when somebody when you
[25:44] know that you can trust what they're
[25:46] saying and that when they communicate
[25:49] and act, it's consistent with how they
[25:50] feel. You're not always trying dec to
[25:53] decode what they're saying.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; You're not always trying to untangle
[25:57] their motives and the things that
[25:58] they're trying to do. In other words,
[26:00] people who are sincere are comfortable
[26:02] comfortable to be around because they're
[26:04] not they're uncomplicated,
[26:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[26:08] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Hey, do you want to go to
[26:09] lunch?" And they don't want to go to
[26:10] lunch. You know what they're going to
[26:11] say? No, I don't want to go to lunch.
[26:15] They're they're not going to say, "Well,
[26:17] what is lunch?"
[26:21] Just tell me, do you want to go to lunch
[26:22] or not? Any if they're sincere, they can
[26:25] speak they can speak honestly about how
[26:27] they're feeling. So there's a there's a
[26:29] lot that I mean in this idea when Paul
[26:31] says sincere and without offense,
[26:32] there's a lot that's meant in
[26:35] the sincerity. They're genuine. They're
[26:36] honest. They're not hypocritical. In
[26:38] first Corinthians chapter 5 6,7 and 8,
[26:42] your glorian is not good. So there's
[26:44] this insincerity that is bound in pride.
[26:48] Sincerity that we'll see what I'm using
[26:50] this scripture for is to show you that
[26:52] sincerity is bound
[26:54] uh bound up in truth. There's an
[26:56] insincerity that's bound up in pride.
[26:58] There's a sincerity that's grounded in
[27:00] truth and then upheld by truth. He says,
[27:03] ' Know ye not that a little levaven
[27:05] leaventh the whole lump? That would
[27:06] speak to insincerity. If something's
[27:08] sincere, it's unmixed. It's pure. And so
[27:11] there's this hypocrisy or this um guile
[27:13] that one would have that kind of
[27:16] impurifies or soleies their motives and
[27:18] their objectives and their actions. So
[27:20] he says, "Purge out the old leaven that
[27:22] you may be a new lump as ye are
[27:24] unleavenvened. For even Christ our
[27:26] Passover is sacrificed for us.
[27:29] Therefore, let us keep the feast, not
[27:31] with old leaven, neither with the
[27:32] leavenven of malice and wickedness, but
[27:34] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[27:37] and truth."
[27:39] &gt;&gt; The word that's used here when he says
[27:40] sincerity and truth, it's a there's
[27:42] several different words in the old New
[27:43] Testament used for sincerity. This one
[27:45] means clearness. The sincerity that's
[27:48] evoked here is to be genuine or unmixed
[27:51] without deceit. So it fits our English
[27:54] word of sincerity
[27:56] and it's it's very close to the sincere
[27:58] judged by the sunlight. I think it's the
[28:00] same uh two different words that are
[28:02] speaking of the same thing. This
[28:04] clearness to be genuine. And so Paul
[28:08] says purge out the old leaven
[28:11] the these influences. uh he says 11 of
[28:14] malice and wickedness where there's the
[28:16] malicees there's no shame in
[28:17] disobedience
[28:19] the wickedness would be judging
[28:21] incorrectly where you call evil good
[28:22] there's a lot that I think he's pointing
[28:24] out here but he says that we would do it
[28:28] while we partake in the unleavened bread
[28:30] of sincerity and truth if I could say
[28:32] this sincerity without truth makes you
[28:34] sincerely wrong
[28:36] &gt;&gt; so brother Brandham said he said said it
[28:38] many different ways that uh you may be
[28:40] sincere but if you're wrong you're just
[28:43] sincerely wrong. So sincerity cannot
[28:47] excuse error. So I'm not advocating for
[28:50] an unscriptural sense of sincerity where
[28:52] we're just all sincere and as if you're
[28:55] wrong, if you're an error, if you're
[28:56] sinning, as long as you're sincere,
[28:58] you're going to be okay. No, sincerity
[29:00] and truth have to be joined together
[29:03] &gt;&gt; because he says, "Let us keep the feast
[29:04] without the leavenven of malice where
[29:07] there's this no shame in being offensive
[29:10] and this wickedness where you call those
[29:12] things which are offensive good or
[29:14] unoffensive
[29:16] in by eating this unleavened bread of
[29:18] sincerity." In truth, malice is that
[29:20] evil habit of your mind, your motives,
[29:21] your objectives, the things you're
[29:23] thinking. And wickedness is the outcome.
[29:26] Whereas inward inwardly being sincere is
[29:29] this singleness towards the word, this
[29:31] purity of mind and heart and then you're
[29:32] outwardly unoffensive.
[29:34] So that the to be sincere and without
[29:36] offense is the opposite of malice and
[29:38] wickedness.
[29:40] Keeping the feast, what he's referring
[29:42] to communion with Christ, the word
[29:46] this who is the the pascal lamb, Christ
[29:48] our Passover. What does that refer to?
[29:50] that time of the Exodus where they
[29:51] feasted in the time of the Exodus in
[29:53] that moment of desperation the death
[29:55] angel's going to be passing over they
[29:57] were given a word that they had to
[29:58] observe and they had to keep that feast
[30:00] Paul is saying now we're keeping the
[30:02] feast Christ but we need to do it with
[30:04] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[30:08] in the sermon the token brother Brandham
[30:11] says this and and I'm going to read a
[30:13] lengthy statement here it's just so
[30:15] beautiful but this taps into brother
[30:17] Brandham's teaching on sincerity says
[30:19] could you imagine than a Jew in the Old
[30:20] Testament coming down with his lamb to
[30:22] make an offering. He was obeying Jehovah
[30:24] what he said to do to him. What he said
[30:27] do to him that went on. He accepted the
[30:31] sacrifice. He seen the lamb died. His
[30:33] hands was bloody with the dying lamb. He
[30:35] went back home justified because he came
[30:38] in sincerity.
[30:41] That was fine. But after a while, it
[30:43] became a tradition. Remember Jesus said,
[30:45] "You've made my commandments of none
[30:47] effect by your traditions. And man said,
[30:50] 'You know, this is the Passover time. We
[30:52] better go do this, and I've got to offer
[30:55] a lamb. It became a place you could buy
[30:58] a lamb and get somebody else to offer it
[31:00] for him. That's what the the temple had
[31:03] become. And Jesus is casting them all
[31:05] out because no one was bringing their
[31:06] own lamb, right? They came with their um
[31:09] their bitcoin and they and they and they
[31:12] bought they traded for a lamb. They
[31:14] bought a lamb at the temple. And so
[31:16] there there was not the same offering
[31:18] anymore. He says it became a creed. It
[31:21] became a dogma in the church. And I
[31:23] think this is important to recognize
[31:24] that there's ways that things can become
[31:27] outwardly
[31:31] uh outwardly aligning with the word of
[31:33] God. But the mechanisms by which it's
[31:36] accomplished is human
[31:38] &gt;&gt; fear, control, pride, pretense. You all
[31:43] know what that feels like. And if you
[31:46] don't, what I'm doing is I'm identifying
[31:48] that uncomfortable feeling you had for
[31:51] many years and trying to serve God and
[31:53] trying to be honest before the Lord and
[31:55] with the message. But the way that it
[31:57] was try, it was being forced in your
[31:59] life, it wasn't because you didn't
[32:00] believe the message. It's not because
[32:02] the message was wrong. It was because it
[32:03] was being used insincerely.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; So he says it became a creed. It became
[32:08] a dogman. God said the very sacrifice
[32:10] that he required became a stink in his
[32:13] nose. There's a lot of scriptures we
[32:14] could use, but I'm trying to be very
[32:15] focused here because it was offered
[32:18] without sincerity. So God rejects
[32:22] obedience that's insincere.
[32:26] And he says, we Pentecostal people are
[32:29] getting in that same stage. That's
[32:32] right. I really want this to hit home.
[32:34] We come down till the sincerity's gone
[32:37] among us. We come in and try to take in
[32:40] people into the church like the other
[32:41] church does to get big crowds and so
[32:43] forth in our churches. We should never
[32:45] do that
[32:48] success.
[32:50] WE'VE GOT TO COME TO sincerity
[32:53] and there die as dead as we can be that
[32:56] the blood of Jesus Christ and the token
[32:58] can come upon us. It makes a person a
[33:01] different person.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS IT'S GOT TO THERE'S GOT TO BE
[33:05] sincerity joined with this. I I love how
[33:07] that we're able to see these two sides.
[33:09] We all say, "Well, which way is it?
[33:10] Which way is it?" You can be sincerely
[33:13] wrong, but now you can be insincerely
[33:16] right.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; And so, we need sincerity and truth.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; It it it's this balancing to come to the
[33:23] REAL HEART. WE'VE GOT TO COME sincerely
[33:25] so that we can be made a different
[33:27] person. He says, "A woman can get up
[33:28] there and go away. She wants to obey
[33:31] every scripture in the Bible regardless
[33:33] of what takes place. A man the same
[33:35] way." no denomination, no creed or
[33:37] nothing else can ever separate uh him
[33:40] from the love of God that he found there
[33:42] at the altar if he'll continue to follow
[33:44] the way of the Lord. So he's saying that
[33:46] there is a place we can come to if we
[33:49] have these means or these traditions. I
[33:53] think brother Brandham even teaches us
[33:54] that prayer lines are a Pentecostal
[33:56] tradition.
[33:58] Even he likens it even to a a Hebrew
[34:00] tradition, a Jewish tradition. And
[34:02] there's nothing wrong with prayer lines.
[34:04] DON'T EVER GET THAT in your head that
[34:06] there's something wrong with laying
[34:06] hands on the sick. It's scriptural. You
[34:09] say, "Well, the the the altar, coming to
[34:10] the altar and praying, well, that's this
[34:12] and that's that and that's an old
[34:13] Methodist thing there and that's an old
[34:14] Baptist thing there." Well, there's
[34:17] there may be histories and etmologies to
[34:19] the things we do and they may be
[34:21] tradition. But what brother is saying
[34:23] it's when it becomes solely a tradition,
[34:25] that's what where it loses its power
[34:27] because you can do it. You just check
[34:29] the box. But when you come sincerely to
[34:31] an altar because you want to meet God
[34:33] there, he's saying YOU CAN LEAVE THAT
[34:35] altar a changed person. When you come
[34:37] sincerely through the prayer line
[34:39] believing that the lay hands on the sick
[34:41] and they shall recover and you're
[34:42] looking to the word for your healing,
[34:44] you can receive healing.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; But if you don't if you come insincerely
[34:48] even though it may be right, YOU GET THE
[34:50] WRONG KIND OF TASTE and you create this
[34:53] loop cycle of experiences and you don't
[34:56] get up from the altar. You don't leave
[34:58] the prayer line having met God and been
[35:00] a different person.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "But today we don't have the
[35:04] sincerity to it. We just take it as just
[35:07] a tradition." Well, our fathers did
[35:09] this.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; I think we do have many traditions. I
[35:13] would even argue that our Sunday morning
[35:15] service, our Wednesday night services
[35:18] are traditional. We do these things
[35:20] traditionally.
[35:22] But then if you we approach it
[35:23] sincerely,
[35:25] not just by tradition, not just because
[35:27] it's the calendar. Just think how
[35:29] awesome thanksgiving can be.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; If we don't just approach it as
[35:33] tradition, but it's with sincerity,
[35:37] sincere thanksgiving in our hearts, a
[35:39] moment of reflection in terms of what
[35:41] God has done for us and appreciation for
[35:43] the people that you gather with.
[35:45] I think that regardless of
[35:49] uh I I guess I need to be careful how I
[35:51] say this, the filters are working
[35:56] that we should strive, we should
[36:01] for those that have hurt us and offended
[36:03] us and even those who've done great harm
[36:06] to us, we should bring them before the
[36:08] Lord in prayer
[36:11] that perhaps God could help us to
[36:13] understand a person and maybe even see
[36:15] they're good. But I believe what brother
[36:18] that in doing so even with certain
[36:21] people you can be thankful for
[36:23] something.
[36:25] So we must never be insincere.
[36:29] Jesus said in Matthew 15:8, "This people
[36:31] drawth nigh unto me with their mouth
[36:33] outwardly
[36:35] righteous and honorth me with their
[36:37] lips." So there's this external
[36:41] uh right conduct, obedience as we
[36:44] referred to it a moment ago, but their
[36:46] heart is far from me. So outwardly they
[36:50] appear unoffensive,
[36:53] but inwardly they're not sincere. What
[36:55] does it become? Vain worship. It's
[36:58] empty. It if the heart's not connected
[37:01] with it, then then God's not pleased
[37:04] with it.
[37:06] just seeing what I had written down here
[37:08] on this slide. I kind of like the way
[37:09] that I phrased that. Hey, this isn't
[37:12] even AI.
[37:14] And by that I mean not Aaron's
[37:16] intelligence.
[37:18] Insincere worship is externally correct
[37:21] but internally disconnected. Where did I
[37:24] come up with this?
[37:27] I should have I should have put that in
[37:28] my notes. [snorts]
[37:31] There's something that may look right
[37:32] outwardly, but if the heart's not if the
[37:35] heart's not in it, then it becomes
[37:37] disconnected.
[37:38] Brother Brandham in approaching these
[37:40] things in the sermon communion,
[37:43] you should recognize the date in this.
[37:44] This is these are the last words we hear
[37:46] from him. He says, "You don't take the
[37:48] Lord's supper by a tradition. You take
[37:51] it because it's the love of God in your
[37:52] heart in keeping the commandments of
[37:54] God. That's what you take it for.
[37:58] So if you don't take it in sincerity,
[38:01] just it's a tradition. Well, our church
[38:03] observes communion every Sunday or once
[38:05] a month or twice a year, you go up and
[38:07] say, "Well, it's my time." I noticed I
[38:09] think that's shows that um the frequency
[38:12] isn't so much what matters because
[38:15] whether you do it every Sunday, once a
[38:18] month, or twice a year, what matters is
[38:21] that you do it because it's right. It's
[38:23] truth. But what undoes it all is
[38:26] insincerity. Well, our church observes
[38:28] communion. Well, it's time and then take
[38:30] communion. It's a stink to God. That's
[38:33] just a tradition.
[38:36] Even like anything else, you've got to
[38:38] be sincere.
[38:40] God, and the phrase he uses, and he uses
[38:42] this over and over again when he talks
[38:43] about sincerity, God wants the depths of
[38:46] your heart.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham uses the deepness of your
[38:49] heart, the depths of your heart to refer
[38:51] to uh the sincerity. You remember the
[38:54] very God that brought you here on earth
[38:56] is the one you're serving.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; So there's thoughtfulness to this.
[39:00] You're doing this because he said so
[39:02] because it's his order. I believe that's
[39:04] the way we should approach Wednesday
[39:06] nights and Sunday mornings and as we
[39:08] have services is I'm not doing this
[39:09] traditionally. I'm not just doing this
[39:11] because brother Aaron rang the church
[39:12] bell and it's time to go to church. I'm
[39:14] doing this because God who brought me
[39:16] here and the one I'm serving in his word
[39:19] tells me that I should do this. Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Then when we want to come up with
[39:24] deepness of sincerity because it's
[39:27] inward, it's depths. It's in the heart.
[39:29] Knowing that by God's grace that we have
[39:31] been saved, that's the deepness. The
[39:34] Bible even speaks of the deepness of
[39:36] earth. It's the depth that your love may
[39:38] abound more and more. It's that depth of
[39:40] love that allows the the the abounding,
[39:42] the growth, the waxing. I was
[39:45] fellowshipping with brother RH and we
[39:46] were having a conversation about lawyers
[39:48] and I asked him if he knew why they
[39:50] buried lawyers 20t deep when they died
[39:53] and he didn't know and I said because
[39:55] down deep they're good people
[39:58] and so there has to be depthness deep
[40:00] when you said they're there's a deepness
[40:01] to them down deep they're a good person
[40:03] they MAY HAVE A LOT OUT FRONT BUT deep
[40:05] deep inside they're sincere
[40:08] &gt;&gt; he says and we love him and we felt his
[40:10] presence and we see it change our lives
[40:12] it comes back to the changing
[40:15] We can't just try to activate the word
[40:18] of God uh because we we don't like the
[40:20] way we're feeling.
[40:22] I this is some transparency that perhaps
[40:25] maybe um
[40:29] I I'm I'm very careful to share. I
[40:31] tremble thinking about it, but I can
[40:33] remember as a teenager in high school
[40:35] being bound
[40:37] with such great depression and
[40:40] ideiations.
[40:41] And I can remember listening to the
[40:44] message, weeping and crying, standing in
[40:47] front of the tape player in in in the
[40:49] middle of the night in the darkness of
[40:50] my room, crying, saying, "God, help me.
[40:52] God, help me. I don't want to feel this
[40:54] way. I DON'T WANT TO THINK LIKE THIS."
[40:56] But I just didn't want the things I
[40:58] loved to make me so depressed
[41:04] that there was some I mean, I THERE WAS
[41:06] DESPERATION. And I I mean, if I could
[41:08] just be uh uh blunt uh and so that I
[41:11] don't upset the algorithm, I was wanting
[41:12] to be unalived.
[41:15] I didn't want to live anymore.
[41:17] But I didn't want to change the way I
[41:19] was living.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I just wanted the message and the
[41:22] presence I knew that was coming from
[41:24] that voice of God and in THE PRESENCE I
[41:26] COULD FEEL IN MY room as a teenager's
[41:28] backslid living in darkness knowing that
[41:30] God is IN THIS SAYING, "I DON'T WANT TO
[41:32] FEEL THIS WAY. I DON'T WANT TO FEEL THIS
[41:33] WAY." BUT I STILL WANTED TO LIVE THAT
[41:35] WAY.
[41:38] And so there's something about
[41:40] sincerity. When you're willing deeply to
[41:42] be changed, changed, changed, changed.
[41:46] That's when you're sincere. No matter
[41:47] what it takes. And when the day that my
[41:49] life changed, I wept kneeling at the end
[41:52] of my bed saying, "No matter what it
[41:54] takes, I want you back."
[41:58] And I thought about the life I was
[42:00] living. And I repeated it. No matter
[42:03] what it takes.
[42:05] And that's when the change came because
[42:06] that's when God knew I meant business. I
[42:08] was being sincere. I wasn't saying,
[42:11] "Yeah, sure. I'll go to lunch with you.
[42:15] [screaming] I'll do it." There was
[42:17] something that meant it.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; In 1 Timothy 1:5, as brother Brandham is
[42:23] talking about doing things in sincerity,
[42:26] he says that we do it because we keep
[42:28] the commandments of God, because we love
[42:30] God. And this is how the scripture uh
[42:34] Paul says in Galatians that uh we love
[42:36] God and we keep his commandments that
[42:38] his commandments are not grievous. So
[42:40] there's a lot of scriptures we could use
[42:42] but he writes it this way to Timothy.
[42:44] Now the end of the commandment is
[42:45] charity out of a pure heart and that's
[42:48] the that's the ultimate that's the
[42:50] product. Charity out of a pure heart. If
[42:53] we could say that charity is expressive
[42:55] and not just merely an attribute it's a
[42:56] characteristic that then begins to be
[42:58] expressed. It's something expressed.
[43:00] Love that abounds from a pure heart and
[43:02] of a good conscience and a faith
[43:04] unfeigned. Such I love that. Charity,
[43:08] conscience, faith, goodness, charity,
[43:11] goodness, faith, pure
[43:14] uh uh this the unfeigned.
[43:17] Notice these things that's being
[43:19] expressed here. This is the depth of
[43:21] heart.
[43:24] Now,
[43:26] some of you may have already been
[43:28] familiar with this. I even know uh in in
[43:30] ministry, I don't know if I've ever used
[43:31] it here, but in the number of years that
[43:33] we have been ministering, still just
[43:34] being a young preacher,
[43:37] that there's uh there's this lore about
[43:40] the meaning of sincerity. And they call
[43:42] it uh folk etmology. In other words,
[43:45] it's actually just kind of more a
[43:48] myth than it is actually truth. But and
[43:51] and if you've ever heard this before,
[43:53] maybe you could say, "I've heard that
[43:54] before." Just say, "Amen." or yeah, but
[43:57] it it's said to mean without wax. And so
[44:00] they take scene in the Latin and they
[44:02] take the other part set which is wax and
[44:04] they've created this word without wax.
[44:06] And so the mythology behind that is they
[44:09] taking they divide the word sincere into
[44:10] these two different words. Uh and they
[44:12] say this mythology is that dishonest
[44:14] potters
[44:16] would use wax to hide cracks or flaws or
[44:19] some other defect in their work.
[44:22] and and there is no uh and trust me I
[44:27] deep dived on this there's no um there's
[44:32] no truth in that etmology the word does
[44:35] not mean without wax though you could
[44:37] divide it and find Latin prefixes and
[44:39] suffixes that that work with that and
[44:42] the first instance that you could find
[44:44] is just a reference in the 1600s about
[44:47] it meaning this but the more I I looked
[44:49] at and the more I thought about it this
[44:51] without wax though it's an incorrect uh
[44:54] it's kind of like a busted myth
[44:58] and it's busted even in this sense.
[44:59] Let's just say it's folk etmology and it
[45:01] it it has like a little cute type to it.
[45:04] But think of this. In reality, wax would
[45:07] easily melt
[45:10] if the vessel was tested by heat.
[45:14] if it was examined by the sunlight.
[45:17] In other words, if you were going to buy
[45:19] someone's wares and they say, "Oh, look
[45:20] at this beautiful pot, this coffee mug."
[45:22] And and look at it and you were to take
[45:24] it and the kind of the the way I've
[45:25] heard it expressed before and even
[45:26] myself in reading um pure and unsolied
[45:29] found pure when examined by the sunlight
[45:31] and say, "Well, what does that even
[45:32] mean?" And then we the example said,
[45:34] "Oh, sincere means without wax." And
[45:36] what that means is that there was
[45:37] pottery. When pottery is sincere, it
[45:39] means there's no wax veneer. There's
[45:41] nothing been used or shaped or colored
[45:43] on top of what's been fashioned and
[45:44] formed through that fire and through
[45:46] that process to give you the appearance
[45:48] of completeness. So you take it and you
[45:50] hold it up to the light and if there was
[45:52] any wax maybe it would it would gl the
[45:55] the light would show whether or not they
[45:57] had used some deceptive means to present
[46:00] their pottery as complete or intact.
[46:02] Right?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; And so if we think about this that well
[46:06] if you're trying to give me something
[46:08] say well here enjoy this coffee mug and
[46:11] there's a crack in it and I used wax to
[46:14] seal it. You know what would expose
[46:15] that? Just put a little hot coffee in
[46:17] there
[46:19] and right away the wax would melt.
[46:23] And so there's a a type that I saw in
[46:26] this though it's folk etmology and it's
[46:28] maybe not true. I love the fact that the
[46:30] the myth the the how it is unwound is it
[46:34] would be way too easy to test
[46:36] whether or not something was genuine. I
[46:39] I want to buy that vase, but I'm just
[46:41] going to leave it in the sunlight.
[46:42] You're at the farmers market in August,
[46:45] right? You know, if you if you get there
[46:48] late, all the cracks in the pots are
[46:50] exposed if there was wax in this case.
[46:53] So in the spiritual sense, anything we
[46:55] try to use
[46:57] to cover our defect is as good as wax
[47:02] in God's presence.
[47:06] Wax to wax something, if you use it as a
[47:08] verb, it's to coat or cover with wax.
[47:10] Some of you may have been waxing your
[47:12] cars yesterday. You weren't increasing
[47:14] them or growing them. you were taking,
[47:17] you were covering over a scratch
[47:20] with wax to to wax them to stop or plug
[47:23] a hole with wax.
[47:26] So, if we could think about this this
[47:28] image that one would use that pottery
[47:32] with a defect,
[47:35] someone could deceitfully just try to
[47:37] wax over it and cover up the defect.
[47:41] And and
[47:44] this is where I I just pray God give me
[47:47] a grace to be able to express this.
[47:52] There's nothing we're there's nothing
[47:53] you and I can do to fix our flaws.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:57] And truly religion
[48:02] can be this human waxing
[48:05] of our weaknesses
[48:08] that that we we're just trying to cover
[48:09] up. We're we're just trying to make good
[48:11] on Sunday morning. What drove us crazy
[48:13] on Saturday night? And there's a way
[48:16] that we're we're we're applying things
[48:20] to take a vessel and dress it up.
[48:23] When in one sense, whatever we are, God
[48:27] sees us for that.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Remember how we use the in the sunlight,
[48:32] in his presence, all our iniquities, all
[48:34] our mistakes are there. And that
[48:36] therefore the the the psalmist cries
[48:38] out, "Lord, hide my iniquities from
[48:41] you."
[48:43] And and so it so the in Isaiah says,
[48:46] "You've cast all my iniquities behind my
[48:48] back." So that it's the act of God
[48:52] intentionally
[48:53] removing them or covering them with the
[48:55] blood, the token that changes you. Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And not this idea that IF I COULD
[49:00] SOMEHOW SUPERFICIALLY SHORE MYSELF UP
[49:03] BEFORE GOD OR BEFORE HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE
[49:06] MYSELF FEEL GOOD ABOUT MY WEAKNESSES,
[49:07] EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY. YOU'RE
[49:09] JUST WAXED.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL YOU ARE. YOU'VE COVERED IT UP
[49:13] WITH THIS. YOU'VE TRIED TO PLUG THE
[49:15] HOLES. INSTEAD, WE OUGHT TO BE SO HONEST
[49:17] BEFORE GOD AND SAY, "LORD, YOU EXAMINE
[49:19] ME FOR ALL MY FLAWS and all my defects.
[49:21] I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST. I STRUGGLE WITH
[49:22] THIS. I STRUGGLE WITH THAT. I'M WEAK
[49:24] with this. THIS SCARES ME. THIS BOTHERS
[49:26] ME.
[49:27] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; And we come into his presence because
[49:32] what's going to happen in his presence
[49:33] is all the wax is going to melt.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Going to be examined by the sunlight.
[49:38] And then he say empty and broken. I came
[49:41] back to him.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; A vessel unworthy so marred by sin.
[49:48] A believer here in our church recently
[49:50] sent an email to the audiovisisual
[49:52] department and I accidentally set
[49:55] something up up on my phone to where now
[49:57] I get those emails and so I saw the
[49:59] email come through and it was the verses
[50:02] and chorus to a song and the verse was
[50:05] broken and you know destroyed and
[50:08] distraught and empty and I need your
[50:10] healing Lord and I wrote back to the
[50:12] brother and I said this is quite the
[50:13] confession brother we'll be praying for
[50:15] you
[50:17] as if this was just a, you know,
[50:19] confessional,
[50:21] you know, anonymously. I'm on the other
[50:23] end of this. It's called confessionals
[50:25] at a believers.com. And so therefore, I
[50:28] take your confessions. You don't know
[50:29] who's hearing it, but I know who you
[50:31] are.
[50:34] But there's this there's this idea we're
[50:36] broken. I I I don't want to wax this
[50:38] over.
[50:41] And
[50:42] I I don't know if I'll be able to get
[50:44] into this
[50:45] uh more in the in future services,
[50:50] but being sincere doesn't need to have
[50:52] that I have to invite you into my
[50:54] private life.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean I just become this
[51:00] target. And I think that's something
[51:01] that there's a lot of oversharing. And
[51:03] there's a way that social media and the
[51:04] way that our climate exists now to where
[51:06] there's just there's this almost sense
[51:08] of like I just need to be open. I just
[51:10] need to be an open book and and just
[51:12] examine and know and this honesty and
[51:14] confess your faults one to another.
[51:15] There's a wrong image of Christianity
[51:18] and even the message to where there is a
[51:20] there are boundaries and there's a
[51:22] private life.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And so what we're striving for is not so
[51:26] that everyone can find out that we're
[51:27] hypocrites because it's like, well, I I
[51:29] I seem like a good Christian on on
[51:32] Wednesday nights, but you know, you can
[51:35] you can come rifle through my life and
[51:37] figure out whether or not I'm a
[51:38] hypocrite. No, this is self-examination.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just inviting people into
[51:43] our lives to uncover our That's not what
[51:45] sincerity is.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things that we could
[51:48] say sincerity is, but sincerity
[51:51] when I when I use the phrase unwaxed
[51:54] that we we abandon these human attempts
[51:56] to maintain pretense.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And not that we would then say, well,
[52:01] you know, I got a lot of jealousy in my
[52:03] heart. I'm going to act jealously. But
[52:05] no, I'm abandoning the pretense and the
[52:07] insincerity
[52:09] because it's an honest
[52:11] heart, that depth of heart, as brother
[52:13] Bam's talking about, that produces an
[52:14] honest life
[52:16] that when we wrestle with uh hypocrisy,
[52:19] it's because the hypocrisy is in there.
[52:22] When we wrestle with dishonesty, it's
[52:23] because the dishonestyy's in there. So
[52:25] if I we can become sincere, sincerity
[52:27] will follow. An offensiveness will
[52:29] follow.
[52:33] Romans chapter 9 21 you could expand in
[52:35] the verses before and after. Hath not
[52:37] the potter power over the clay of the
[52:40] same lump, same humanity, same
[52:42] complexes, scars, mistakes and past to
[52:45] make one vessel under honor and another
[52:47] under dishonor.
[52:49] I I want honesty in my heart. I I want
[52:53] to I'm earth just like anybody else. I'm
[52:55] human just like anybody else. I got a
[52:56] past just like anybody else. I've made
[52:58] mistakes just like anybody else. But I
[53:00] want to be honest in my heart so that I
[53:01] can be changed.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Sincerity makes the difference.
[53:06] And Lord, you have power over the clay
[53:09] to make me unto honor.
[53:12] In 2 Timothy chapter 2, 20 to 21.
[53:15] But in a great house there are not only
[53:17] vessels of gold and silver, but also of
[53:19] wood and of earth, and some to honor and
[53:21] some to dishonor. If a man therefore
[53:23] purge himself from these, he shall be a
[53:26] vessel unto honor, sanctified in meat
[53:29] for the master's use, and prepared unto
[53:31] every good work.
[53:34] There is a a a sincerity, a process of
[53:37] becoming sincere where Paul says, "Purge
[53:39] out the old leaven. Let's get rid of the
[53:40] malice. Get rid of the wickedness. Get
[53:42] rid of the hypocrisy. Get rid of the
[53:43] doubt.
[53:45] The purging out of the dishonorable
[53:47] because I want to be a vessel of honor.
[53:50] I want to be made. Even if I'm just made
[53:52] of the earth, a vessel made of the
[53:54] earth. You say, "Well, pure gold. I'm
[53:55] pure gold." No, we may not be pure gold.
[53:57] We're made for the earth, but we can
[53:58] still be vessels of honor. There's a lot
[54:01] that's meant in this purge himself from
[54:03] these. There's a lot even Paul's drawing
[54:05] from in the Old Testament. Then I can be
[54:06] sanctified, meat for the master's use as
[54:09] a vessel of honor.
[54:13] Christ, God himself, he's a he's a a
[54:16] fire. Our God is a consuming fire.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; It's his nature. If you want to take
[54:22] fire to your bosom, you're going to get
[54:25] warmed up. Heat, you're going to get
[54:27] burned. I want him to burn out of me
[54:29] anything that's not pure
[54:31] to melt the wax. Men don't come to the
[54:34] light because they're afraid.
[54:37] I know there's even in Greek mythology
[54:40] there's a the nearness to the sun that
[54:42] causes the the the wax to melt and the
[54:45] power to be lost. And so men don't come
[54:48] to the light because they know in the
[54:50] light they they they'll become unwaxed.
[54:53] Their flaws and weaknesses discovered 1
[54:56] Corinthians chapter 3 11-16. For other
[54:59] foundation can no man lay than is than
[55:01] that is laid which is Jesus Christ.
[55:04] Truth. Now if any man build upon this
[55:07] foundation gold, silver, precious
[55:08] stones, wood, hay, stubble. So there's a
[55:10] lot of different ways we can build.
[55:12] Every man's work shall be made manifest,
[55:14] for the day shall declare it.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; So if we have the foundation of Jesus
[55:19] Christ and we build upon it a house made
[55:21] out of hay,
[55:23] then when the day of the Lord comes and
[55:25] he huffs and he puffs, what will he do?
[55:26] He will blow that house down because
[55:29] every work shall be made manifest. of
[55:31] the day shall declare it because it
[55:33] SHALL BE REVEALED BY FIRE.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; A WAX HOUSE isn't going to do you any
[55:37] good.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; We're entering into the gingerbread
[55:41] house season,
[55:42] right? When we try to figure out how to
[55:44] use icing to cause pieces of gingerbread
[55:47] to hold together and make a house. Well,
[55:48] you better know what you're doing. Use
[55:51] glue, not icing, because time will tell
[55:55] whether or not it's the elements will
[55:57] come to bear. the heat of a of a
[56:00] Christmas day when it's 98 degrees in
[56:03] Phoenix. It's going to declare the
[56:06] structural integrity of what you built.
[56:09] It shall be revealed by fire. It's going
[56:11] to be discovered what it was made of.
[56:13] And the fire shall try every man's work
[56:15] of what sort it is. If any man's work
[56:18] abide,
[56:22] which he shall build thereon, he shall
[56:24] receive a reward.
[56:26] So if if you're waxing, it's going to be
[56:29] it's going to be discovered.
[56:32] It's going to be found out. If any man's
[56:34] work shall be burned, he shall suffer
[56:35] loss. But he himself shall be saved. Yet
[56:38] so as by fire.
[56:40] So I would even take piggyback off of
[56:42] this. I know we've ministered a lot on
[56:44] these rewards and and spent some time on
[56:46] these scriptures. Don't be afraid to
[56:48] become unwaxed.
[56:51] Don't be afraid to be tried by fire
[56:53] because the Bibles even say here, you're
[56:54] saved as so by fire. I don't want to
[56:57] risk being lost.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And refusal to come to the light ensures
[57:02] you being lost.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Refusing to be examined by the sun. Say,
[57:07] I I'm afraid TO GET CLOSER TO GOD. I'M
[57:09] AFRAID TO DIG INTO THE WORD OF GOD. I'M
[57:10] AFRAID to accept it as my absent. I'm
[57:12] afraid I'm afraid to receive it as truth
[57:14] because it's GOING TO EXPOSE ALL THESE
[57:16] THINGS. WELL, IF THAT'S WORST case
[57:19] scenario,
[57:20] that's good
[57:23] &gt;&gt; because THEN THE DISHONORABLE IS PURGED.
[57:25] THE FALSITIES ARE DECLARED and removed
[57:27] and you're LEFT BARE BEFORE GOD. BUT
[57:29] YOU'RE SAVED IN THAT.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; It's refusing TO COME TO LIGHT. IT'S
[57:33] REFUSING TO BE JUDGED, REFUSING TO BE
[57:35] EXAMINED. THAT keeps you in your sins.
[57:38] Know ye not that? He says in verse 16,
[57:40] "Know ye not that you are the temple of
[57:42] God and that the spirit of God dwelleth
[57:44] in you?" Does it not bring before us
[57:46] this beautiful image of how that the
[57:50] word of God
[57:52] TRIES US
[57:54] &gt;&gt; AND EXAMINES us because we are his
[57:56] temples.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Because we are vessels OF CLAY, NOT
[58:00] MEANT TO CARRY COMPLEXES. Not meant to
[58:02] carry the filth OF THIS WORLD. NOT MEANT
[58:04] TO BE VESSELS FOR GARBAGE TO BE
[58:06] DEPOSITED in us and people to GET
[58:08] GARBAGE OUT. BUT WE'RE VESSELS OF GLORY
[58:11] TO DECLARE HIS GLORY SO THAT WE can be
[58:14] HIS GLORY BEING EXTENDED TO those who
[58:17] are waxed.
[58:20] Let my love be the intensity that melts
[58:23] away their wax.
[58:30] Trial of our faith
[58:32] is much more precious than that of gold
[58:34] that perishes. 1 Peter 1:7.
[58:37] though it be tried with fire. So Paul is
[58:40] Peter's praying that your faith would be
[58:41] tried. Your faith is more precious than
[58:44] gold. The trial is more precious than
[58:45] gold. Gold tried by the fire becomes
[58:48] purified because whatever is not gold
[58:51] leaves
[58:52] the byproduct.
[58:54] And I love how the analogy I read one
[58:57] time is that with resp that I used with
[59:00] there's no amount of gold that you can
[59:03] add to gold that'll ever make it fool's
[59:06] gold.
[59:09] But you can't add gold to fool's gold
[59:12] and turn fool's gold into gold.
[59:14] Therefore, there's no amount of word
[59:16] that you can add to your faith that
[59:18] would make it
[59:19] &gt;&gt; uh faithless or doubtful
[59:22] &gt;&gt; or unbelief.
[59:23] So that it's in that purity of the word
[59:26] upon word, the right kind of structure
[59:27] or support. And then on that we're
[59:29] putting the word and not just the
[59:31] covering of the word on fool's gold.
[59:36] But try me with fire that I might be
[59:37] founded to praise, honor, and glory.
[59:41] Let Christ try you.
[59:45] No wax.
[59:47] If sincerity, if we say in folk etmology
[59:49] or an old wives tale or from the
[59:51] farmer's almanac, it means without wax,
[59:53] then I want to be without wax.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; I want to be sincere.
[59:59] Search out anything that's deceitful.
[1:00:01] Not that I I'm made to be that I'm a
[1:00:03] liar, but Lord, search out anything
[1:00:05] that's pretentious, that's politics or
[1:00:08] pride.
[1:00:16] Psalms 51. We invite the musicians to
[1:00:18] come. We'll just end with this verse. I
[1:00:20] know, brother John, there may be some
[1:00:21] other uh slides there, but we'll just
[1:00:24] hold them for another time.
[1:00:26] But I think this
[1:00:34] I think the scripture is beautiful. Then
[1:00:36] I do want to maybe use some things from
[1:00:37] the paradox.
[1:00:40] But it says in Psalms 51 6 and 7,
[1:00:42] "Behold, thou desireest truth in the
[1:00:45] inward parts in us." He desires truth
[1:00:49] inwardly, and in the hidden part, thou
[1:00:52] shalt make me to know wisdom.
[1:00:55] I think it speaks to this. I I don't
[1:00:58] want to be perceived outwardly
[1:01:02] as holy.
[1:01:04] I want to genuinely sincerely in my
[1:01:06] heart be holy.
[1:01:09] Knowing that if he began that work of
[1:01:12] righteousness in me, then I have this
[1:01:16] treasure in earth and vessels that the
[1:01:18] excellency of the power is not me but
[1:01:20] it's of God. Therefore, I can be filled
[1:01:23] with the fruits of righteousness [music]
[1:01:24] which are by Jesus Christ, not myself,
[1:01:26] unto the glory and the beauty and the
[1:01:28] brilliance of God.
[1:01:31] So, he desires truth in the inward parts
[1:01:33] and in the hidden part he'll [music]
[1:01:35] make me to know wisdom. It's this deep
[1:01:37] depthness of earth. It's the work that
[1:01:39] he does in my heart where I'm inwardly
[1:01:41] sincere. Therefore, I'm being changed
[1:01:43] that I can become outwardly unoffensive
[1:01:45] as it pertains to his word.
[1:01:47] There's a book I haven't I never read
[1:01:49] it. I thought it might make make a good
[1:01:51] book to read, but I there was a
[1:01:52] gentleman one time who lived the Old
[1:01:54] Testament for a year and he was kind of
[1:01:57] sharing his results. And so we could say
[1:02:01] that if he would did in fact observe the
[1:02:05] Old Testament law for a year outwardly
[1:02:09] he appeared obedient
[1:02:12] to the law.
[1:02:16] and that there was this external
[1:02:20] representation
[1:02:21] of the biblical Levitical law, but he's
[1:02:25] not the essence of it. It w it wasn't
[1:02:29] sincerity. It was a science project,
[1:02:32] social experiment.
[1:02:35] So the psalmist [music] says, "You want
[1:02:38] truth in the inward parts, not just
[1:02:40] traditional obedience that takes care of
[1:02:43] the outward part. because I want in the
[1:02:45] hidden part, [music] the part that can't
[1:02:46] be seen. I want to know wisdom.
[1:02:49] So he says, "Purge me with hissip."
[1:02:52] Think of now what he's drawing from in
[1:02:55] the in the image of the sacrifices.
[1:02:57] Purge me with hissip [music] and the
[1:02:59] application of blood, the token being
[1:03:01] applied. Purge me with hissip and I
[1:03:03] shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be
[1:03:06] whiter than snow.
[1:03:09] What this speaks of is the inward
[1:03:11] [music] sincerity.
[1:03:13] I want to be sincere and without
[1:03:15] offense. I want to be pure and smooth.
[1:03:19] I want to be unwaxed.
[1:03:21] So, we should pray for sincerity.
[1:03:25] I'll pick up it on Wednesday night. And
[1:03:26] I know you're all familiar uh with this.
[1:03:29] So, I I can just end and I know [music]
[1:03:31] I it's it's getting long here, but
[1:03:33] you're familiar when brother Adam gave
[1:03:35] the vision of what he called the mamba.
[1:03:38] And he tells it and he and that mamba,
[1:03:40] it represents sin and death. this black
[1:03:42] snake and he tells the story in great
[1:03:44] detail in paradox in 1961 [music] he's
[1:03:46] talking about he came to this narrow
[1:03:48] highway and he's twothirds he's in that
[1:03:50] third pull as he comes to [music] Jordan
[1:03:52] we see the the image of a translation
[1:03:54] and a rapture and he said that everyone
[1:03:56] was afraid and they were all scared and
[1:03:59] what were they afraid of the strike of
[1:04:00] death so there's this image now this
[1:04:03] beautiful image as he approaches the
[1:04:05] opening of the seals which is the third
[1:04:06] pole a and the revealing of the word the
[1:04:08] opening of the word there's this
[1:04:09] beautiful image now if everyone's afraid
[1:04:11] of death. Everyone's afraid of death.
[1:04:13] And and they saw this one brother was
[1:04:15] kind of dancing and he [music] was
[1:04:16] trying to get away from the snake. And
[1:04:18] brother used the phrase that it's
[1:04:20] instant death if it bites you.
[1:04:24] And he said that something that it came
[1:04:25] after brother Brandham. He said, but as
[1:04:28] it [music] came after him, something was
[1:04:29] holding it off.
[1:04:33] Just such a a beautiful thought. It
[1:04:34] couldn't get to him.
[1:04:36] Something was holding off. But he said,
[1:04:37] then it went after a friend. And in that
[1:04:40] moment is this realization. Well, I I is
[1:04:42] will it get them? Will it get them? And
[1:04:44] I know this so much of this can relate
[1:04:46] to brother Brandham's calling
[1:04:47] personally. But then a voice said, "You
[1:04:49] have been given power [music] to bind
[1:04:50] him, the worst or any."
[1:04:55] So you have been given power to bind the
[1:04:58] greatest
[1:04:59] of all powers, [music] the greatest of
[1:05:01] all consequences of unbelief, death.
[1:05:03] Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; And therefore, if you can bind an
[1:05:07] attribute of unbelief called death, then
[1:05:10] you can bind them all.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, well, he
[1:05:15] said, just then the serpent turned to me
[1:05:17] when I said that and looked at me
[1:05:18] [music] again.
[1:05:20] And the voice came from above me and
[1:05:22] said, you've been given power to bind
[1:05:24] him the worst or any. And I said, what?
[1:05:28] I'm so glad he tells the story.
[1:05:30] Well, God, what must I do?
[1:05:34] Notice this isn't the day of Pentecost.
[1:05:36] What must I DO TO BE SAVED? NOW, THIS IS
[1:05:38] NOT the beginning of the church. This is
[1:05:40] the climax. This isn't the new birth and
[1:05:43] the seal of the Holy Ghost. This is the
[1:05:44] rapture. THIS IS THE PLACING THAT last
[1:05:46] enemy under our feet. This is Satan
[1:05:48] being bruised under your FEET SHORTLY.
[1:05:50] THIS IS NOT JUST FACING FACING SIN. THIS
[1:05:53] IS FACING DEATH, WHICH WAS THE
[1:05:54] CONSEQUENCE OF SIN. LORD, WHAT MUST I
[1:05:57] DO? HE SAID, THERE'S ONE THING YOU MUST
[1:05:58] DO. You must [music] be more sincere.
[1:06:02] You must be more sincere.
[1:06:06] There's your answer. In our homes, in
[1:06:09] our personal lives, in our
[1:06:10] relationships, what what do I need? What
[1:06:12] is it [music] that's causing me this
[1:06:13] disconnect with my children? What is it
[1:06:14] that's c causing a disconnect with my
[1:06:16] spouse? Could it be you need to be more
[1:06:18] sincere?
[1:06:20] That maybe there's too much of hiding
[1:06:23] certain things and and too much outfront
[1:06:25] and not enough openness and
[1:06:26] communication.
[1:06:28] having tremendous fellowship [music] on
[1:06:29] this Friday night with some some friends
[1:06:31] on on the importance of communication.
[1:06:34] How easily things could be
[1:06:35] misunderstood.
[1:06:38] And where that comfort comes from is
[1:06:40] knowing
[1:06:42] that even if you misunderstand somebody
[1:06:44] in the beginning that if you're both
[1:06:46] sincere,
[1:06:48] you're not going to let
[1:06:49] misunderstandings and misrepresentations
[1:06:52] and all the wax [music] to get in the
[1:06:54] way. are going to take the time to
[1:06:55] eventually allow love to melt the
[1:06:58] pretense.
[1:07:00] You must be more sincere. This tells me
[1:07:04] that we have truth.
[1:07:07] The word of God is true. And rapturing
[1:07:10] faith lays in the word of God. There's
[1:07:12] nothing that needs to be added to it. So
[1:07:14] we say, "What must we do?" Well, you
[1:07:16] need to come back and preach the seals,
[1:07:17] Brother Brandham. No,
[1:07:20] we need to be
[1:07:22] more sincere with truth.
[1:07:26] We in denominational thought and
[1:07:28] organizational thought and in in
[1:07:30] man-made religion were sincere [music]
[1:07:32] with error
[1:07:34] and we maybe in some ways become
[1:07:36] Pentecostal in the sense that [music]
[1:07:38] we have been insincere with truth
[1:07:42] and that's still not going to work.
[1:07:43] Well, it's the truth. We get results,
[1:07:45] don't we? No, we got to come back to
[1:07:46] sincerity and truth. Unwaxed.
[1:07:50] We've got a new motto as message
[1:07:52] believers. We're no longer declaring to
[1:07:55] everyone that we're unvaxed.
[1:07:58] As red-blooded Americans who believe in
[1:08:01] the Constitution,
[1:08:03] but we're believers who believe the word
[1:08:05] of God. [music]
[1:08:07] The token has been applied.
[1:08:10] Therefore, my motto in my heart is I
[1:08:12] want to be unwaxed.
[1:08:15] Faith and the word of God gives us power
[1:08:16] over [music] sin and death.
[1:08:19] Wax is what will stand in your way.
[1:08:22] Brother Victor, I've learned about wax
[1:08:25] resistors.
[1:08:27] Is that am I using the phrase right? And
[1:08:29] in the making of pottery, you actually
[1:08:32] use wax in [music]
[1:08:34] the firing process and in the glazing
[1:08:36] process to manipulate and [music] to
[1:08:39] control what happens because the wax
[1:08:42] won't remain afterwards.
[1:08:45] So, if you don't [music] want your your
[1:08:46] your your earth and wear to stick in the
[1:08:49] kiln, you use wax as a resistor and it's
[1:08:51] going to keep it from sticking. The max
[1:08:52] will welt and they'll be able to
[1:08:54] separate [music] apart. And what what
[1:08:56] began to strike me, we'll just pick up
[1:08:57] it on Wednesday night. I keep saying
[1:08:59] that, but maybe we'll just preach until
[1:09:00] then and we'll get to it.
[1:09:02] It's what it means to be unwax saints
[1:09:05] to church on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
[1:09:08] [music] Wednesday, you are dismissed,
[1:09:11] but the wax will get in the way of the
[1:09:13] [music] process.
[1:09:16] So, I want to be unwaxed.
[1:09:19] Another title I was going to use perhaps
[1:09:21] was waxing. I want to be growing.
[1:09:24] [music] I want to be sincere without
[1:09:26] offense. I want my love to be waxing
[1:09:28] more and more in all knowledge and all
[1:09:30] discernment. [music] Let's stand. Let's
[1:09:31] pray together this morning.
[1:09:34] Thank you so much for your
[1:09:35] attentiveness. Thank you for your
[1:09:37] patience and [music] wrestling through
[1:09:39] sound issues as we work these things
[1:09:40] out. Appreciate the brothers who labor
[1:09:43] to do this and they [music] they suffer
[1:09:46] the embarrassment and the
[1:09:47] uncomfortableness
[1:09:49] to make it happen. So, I appreciate
[1:09:50] that. But if you need prayer today, just
[1:09:52] let's bow [music] our heads. Just be
[1:09:54] sincere before the Lord. Say, "Lord, I'm
[1:09:56] willing to be examined by the sunlight.
[1:09:58] [music] If I'm going to be a sunlit
[1:10:00] vessel, then he has to purge me. He has
[1:10:03] to expose all the wax. I [music] say,
[1:10:05] "Well, I'm flawed. I've got a past. I've
[1:10:07] got these problems." Well, God knows
[1:10:08] what to do with it. He knows exactly
[1:10:11] [music] what to do with it. Don't be
[1:10:12] afraid of him throwing the clay away. He
[1:10:15] knows. He knows how to use you. He knows
[1:10:18] how to fix you. Remember when we use the
[1:10:20] [music] example
[1:10:22] of how that his deity fills in the
[1:10:24] cracks.
[1:10:25] So, there's no wax. It's just gold.
[1:10:28] that God's going to use to perfect
[1:10:30] [music] your vessel. A gracious heavenly
[1:10:32] father, Lord, today as I bow my heads, I
[1:10:35] realize that it's our wax that keeps us
[1:10:36] from the deity.
[1:10:39] That Lord, as much as I try to plug my
[1:10:41] holes with human [music] thought and
[1:10:44] pretense and politics and
[1:10:47] all the things that are born from pride,
[1:10:50] I'm only keeping myself from you. For
[1:10:53] it's my brokenness [music] that will
[1:10:55] reveal your power. It's my weakness that
[1:10:57] reveals your strength.
[1:10:59] So, Father, I pray today that I would,
[1:11:02] though waxed [music] I may be, I subject
[1:11:05] myself to the sunlight.
[1:11:08] Reveal it by fire. Lord, I'm not afraid
[1:11:10] to be exposed between you and I. I'm not
[1:11:13] asking to be exposed to my friends or my
[1:11:14] spouse, and I'm [music] not wanting
[1:11:16] people to rifle through my private life
[1:11:18] or my past. Lord, some of us have
[1:11:20] suffered that. people bringing up our
[1:11:22] past and [music] other things that may
[1:11:24] be of a public nature easily discovered
[1:11:26] online.
[1:11:28] But Lord, I mean between you and I, I
[1:11:30] don't want anything hindering us. I
[1:11:32] don't want any veils.
[1:11:34] Use my brokenness. Use my emptiness. And
[1:11:36] Lord, remove the wax that's keeping your
[1:11:39] presence from filling it up. And Lord,
[1:11:41] there's been a part of me that's kept
[1:11:43] you away because I was afraid to use
[1:11:44] [music] that lose that resistor. I was
[1:11:46] afraid to lose that wax covering that
[1:11:49] would keep the glaze from covering me
[1:11:51] completely because of fear. Lord, I
[1:11:54] allow you now. [music]
[1:11:56] I allow you now, Father, to come.
[1:12:00] Burn out of me anything that's [music]
[1:12:02] impure.
[1:12:04] Lord, if I'm instructed by the scripture
[1:12:05] to purge myself from these, Lord, you
[1:12:08] begin the work.
[1:12:10] So give me wisdom. Let my love for you
[1:12:12] abound more and more. the more unwaxed I
[1:12:15] can become of the world, the more waxing
[1:12:17] I can become in your word. We love you,
[1:12:20] Lord. We commit ourselves to you. And I
[1:12:22] pray for the lifted hands, the crying
[1:12:23] hearts, that you'd be merciful [music]
[1:12:24] to us. I believe you're dealing with us
[1:12:27] in a very deep way.
[1:12:29] Lord, we must be more [music] sincere.
[1:12:34] And I ask now, Father, that you give us
[1:12:37] a grace.
[1:12:38] Search our hearts, Lord. Let there be
[1:12:40] any insincerity in us. Just show us Lord
[1:12:42] that we [music] may repent of it. In the
[1:12:44] name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
