TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matthew chapter 18 i'm going to begin reading with verse 15. i would like um i even realized right now i was going to read to verse 22. but while you're standing i'm going to take advantage of you your attention and kind of uh teach a little bit through some of these verses because i don't want to come back to them later but i want you to connect with something on this subject of barriers and boundaries it's very relevant scriptures when you recognize this it says moreover if thy brother shall trespass against him he's just been talking about a lost sheep someone who's gone astray he says moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone so you don't do it in front of somebody else you go to them and them alone otherwise it's it's inappropriate if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with the one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if you neglect to hear the church these are very remarkable scriptures because there's only one one other place where jesus mentions the church and that's upon this rock shall i build my church so this mystery of the church is contained in this and also speaks of what paul would establish as the christian church he says if he neglects to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican it's a very heavy statement regard him respect him as a heathen man and republican verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven now notice the power here that's being given you have this power to bind and this power to loose relates to barriers and boundaries that you have been given power to bind whatever you bind in heaven or on earth will be bound in heaven whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so this speaks to your authority the position you have as a believer and even how it would be reflected in heaven again i say it unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them now notice how this speaks to whatever you're binding whatever you're losing comes after addressing a trespass and if the person's not heard then you're going to take with two or three witnesses to address the matter and if they don't hear you they become as a heathen and a publican and then it's saying whatever you bind and it's not speaking to the church speaking to the individual even those that would be witnesses together whatever you bind on earth and if two shall agree on earth these if two shall agree then it shall be as you asked very powerful scriptures that i want you to keep in mind and on the front end as we approach this subject god bless you you can be seated we're talk we are speaking on the subject of barriers and boundaries i thought i would finish tonight it's been impressed upon my heart to go ahead and by god's grace some sum it all up on sunday morning and i think it's very rare that i have that kind of uh sense that i could summarize something and wrap it up but if god would give me the liberty and the grace to do so we'll do that on sunday morning we'll take this subject and uh take a step further in it but try to summon bring it to a climax and then move on from there but we're in the subtitle of respect and we're we're bringing a lot in from these other services we've already preached so this is an upper-level course in this we're just going to jump right in it when we talk about respect we are specifically referring to a healthy respect for yourself and then also a proper respect for others and it is about setting setting and observing boundaries but also addressing barriers and it's a respect when you respect something um you'll set a standard you'll set a limit when you respect something you won't go beyond that if it's somebody else's but then if you have respect for for the appropriate appreciation for something you can see when something's a hindrance something's uh binding up something's keeping something from something's keeping something from something how's that for an alliteration but there is a restraint something's being held back i want to uh define and so i will respect and this is very important to kind of grab on in the beginning and i'm very conscious of the time and i'd ask brother michael to give me a lot of time and he's done so and i'm kind of losing it rapidly but catch on these definitions because i'm going to come right back to them again even if i don't reference them they're going to they're going to pop i think in in at the end to respect means to show or feel a deferential regard for so to show a deference to feel a regard a deference a deference to somebody and it also means to esteem now this would be the most likely definition that we might use out of respect because it connotates maybe some reverence or not necessarily an awe but a deference to somebody and i think it's an appropriate use of the term respect i be brother branham uses it in that sense in many of the places he deals with it uh there's also a definition of agape love that is defined as godly respects and godly love so there's something about respect that's even related to love now respect also maybe in a more general sense carries with it this meaning relationship a relation this is what it originally means it's a relationship with respect to something it's a relation or relationship so it's a regard or consideration and the word respect is literally from the act of looking at someone to respect something is it's literally the etymology of it is to literally from the the word that means the act of looking at one and so we uh those are kind of in in the meaning and the full understanding of the term respect and so we use it to mean kind of the courteous treatment of somebody or the uh to be considerate of someone uh to a treatment that's due someone if you're considerate or uh you're courteous it's a treatment in that treatment it's due to them they deserve this show them the respect that they deserve it's a treatment that they're due and and to regard something since that's kind of in the in the meaning to regard something to regard something's to consider it it's also to judge when you regard something you're judging it you're you're estimating what it uh what it deserves and what its value is and it also means it's to show deferential regard for so it's consideration or judgment but it's also to esteem which means to estimate or to determine so there's a lot that comes to value so there's a lot that comes into the picture when we talk about respect because we could just use it very loosely well i need to respect somebody i just need to and like we do with love because we're talking about we were using the referencing love has limits and so we could just use it very sloppily uh very messy very emotional very huggy feeling and that's not what's intended by the word respect there's some estimation some determination to or value uh what uh what is due and so it's this word respect is about love it's about faith functioning in discernment functioning and judgment a development of faith to into perfect faith a development of love that can recognize what is good and cleave to it recognize what is evil and abhor it and we will not take the time this evening we'll refer back to it but we'll come back to it next service lord willing to love thy neighbor as thyself and also to love thy enemies are calls to respect them when you're asked to love your neighbor we don't we don't default to kind of this you know the kind of love we might have for our wife or the kind of emotional love uh when we're told to love our enemies it's not it's to res it's to have a respect that's even due to a neighbor the most base respect that's due to a neighbor even a respect that's due to your enemies and i want to emphasize that much more in the coming service but if you ponder it right now and just think about it it's a beautifully measured balance of seeing them for what they are and what they can be because if you treat a sinner as a christian as someone who can understand all mysteries as somebody who's walking in the fellowship somebody who has faith and you treat them and regard them as having come to salvation then you could you could miss them where they are and fail to appreciate where they are as a sinner and what they need and you say well then then how do i love them as a brother and how do i treat them right so that they can be saved regard also what they can be because if they're a sinner that means there's potential to be saved and so it's not just uh recognizing oh he's a snake in the grass oh she's an enemy and boy she's sure got a problem it's a measured balance of seeing them for what they are being able to have the testimony that you can't tell who their friends are and who their enemies are not because you just treat everybody the same but you have a way that you conduct yourself in a measured approach to say even if they're my enemy they can be there's a way that you even if they're a sinner even if they're a reprobate i also see them for what they may what they can be now this is picking up on galatians chapter five now if you could turn in your bibles your apps i turn your attention to the screen galatians chapter 5 verses 13 to 15. and this is a was used on sunday and i want to begin here as we take a step further in the subject of respect for brethren you have been called into liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another liberty is often used as a justification for a lot of nonsense paul is saying don't use your liberty as an occasion to satisfy yourself to lift yourself up make yourself look good or even indulge your desires but use your liberty as an opportunity to serve others to serve one another and then this very weighty weighty statement that summarizes even the teachings of christ for all the law is fulfilled in one word the law and the prophets hang on these things that christ mentioned now paul summarizes it in one word one commandment even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if he bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another if you bite that biting that rough harsh speaking when you bite somebody's head off that's what he's talking about this biting this backbiting this stabbing this harsh speaking to devour means to destroy and he says if this is kind of the way you act and the way you interact with one another you're going to take heed because you're going to be consumed one of another you're you are going to be consumed you'll also do the consuming where it would be with bitterness with jealousy through contention and strife that you're overwhelmed and that becomes your metric that becomes your view that becomes your everything he says you better be careful because when you enter into that you are consumed with it now verse 13 has is deserving of a lot of attention he's saying you've been called into liberty so you're free but don't take that don't take advantage of that liberty to serve yourself but serve one another so now you're you're supposed to respect and regard somebody else in even how you conduct yourself well i may have the right to do it but how may this right infringe upon somebody else's comfort level or what they uh what would be respectful to them in other words as we mentioned before paul is saying don't always take the liberty i have the liberty well i'm just going to take the liberty i believe we ask the question of just because we can should we and we should never take advantage of somebody or defraud somebody in in in the moment of the opportunity we have to do it and then justify the ends like well it's going to work out for the good like could you imagine all this stuff we could do well all things work together for the good right and so it's kind of calling out that attitude that lacks the wisdom to see things how they might unfold so he's saying don't don't always just because you can give somebody a piece of your mind i don't always just uh be kind of the bull in a china closet because you can't you can do it and it's it's expressing this idea don't let your liberty be let liberty be somebody else's bondage though we might be able to justify it through liberty and justify it because i can and justify it because it's my right or however we might justify it he said let's not use our liberty solely to serve ourselves but to consider one another and when paul is identifying the biting the devouring and even i realize i'm drawing it from a larger context from the scripture he's dealing with temperance which temperance is self-control and it's the ability the power to restrain desires the power to uh restrain passions and you it's described in a person who should have be a city with walls a city without walls a man who cannot control himself is like a city without walls and broken down paul is paul is saying that we ought to be cities with walls that the scripture says that better is a man who can control himself than a man who can tear down a wall we need to be the stronger people we need to be the stronger person and temperance relates to the power to control the tongue we'll recognize that through the teaching of the message of the hour and since it relates very generally to self-control uh and but also to how we speak temperance regards not only physical boundaries but also the emotional ones and it is our and i want to be very uh very purposeful in what i'm about to say our words and our actions because can be agents of harm or health what we say and what we do can either cause hurt continue to hurt or it can promote healing or bring health as we use those scriptures last time and we ought knowing that our words have the ability to breach a spirit knowing that the tongue can be a tree of life knowing that our actions can either promote healing kind words can bring healing certain things can bring healing other things can bring sickness knowing that then self-control moderates that power for its best use and we're in looking at just because we can we have the right should we we use the example of marriage and now that there's this perversion of the headship of the man over the home to where he kind of looks at his wife is his property and so since you're my property you can do you do whatever i ask you to do and there's a very unhealthy uh relationship that exists in that dynamic so we were looking at the example of marriage and identifying how that mutual respect is the key that to have the mutual respect it's the key to fellowship it's a key to intimacy it's a key to a good relationship when there's mutual respect a husband could have all of his needs met in a marriage just purely out of fear not respect purely because the wife is in a co-dependent relationship and so the the dishes need to be washed the meals need to be cooked the the bed needs to be made and she's like what am i going to do if he leaves me there's kind of this abandonment so out of fear of abandonment a man can have all his needs met but that's not a real relationship and and key in on this because this is the i could have just as easily called this sermon respect uh um something about relationship because it's so much about relationship a relationship when we talk about words can either hurt or harm actions to either hurt or harm or hurt or heal in either one it's the relationship that's going to determine the contact context of our words or actions somebody may do something to somebody else and we may view it as being a tremendous offense but to that person whom they've done it to it it may be something that's completely benign and there's nothing no nothing loaded in it there's nothing disrespectful but maybe through our own prism our own experience we may see that and say oh well how could they treat somebody that way and it's because the relationship gives context to what is said and what is done and it's what's going to determine what is appropriate there may be something that you feel like you can say to anybody but it may not be appropriate to just anybody it may be appropriate to somebody in context but not appropriate to somebody else in a different context and brother reggie spoke in our little youth meeting we had sunday evening on repentance makes way for fellowship and it was very beautiful the way that he expressed it and how that it's through the act of repenting that it produces and brings the reconciliation or it's going to bring forth the relationship and he was looking at it from the standpoint of the first fruits of repenting and doing what one ought to when they're convicted of sin but it's in that repentance to change mind to regard something it leads it leads makes way for fellowship because the fellowship is what promotes and nurtures relationship and it's a very important concept i hope maybe can be expressed a little bit more and we used psalm 25 verse 14 and this is important to have right before us tonight the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will show them his covenant this is a an astounding prophecy for the time that we're living in yet we can bring it down to a personal level the seeker the lord is with them that fear him so if you fear the lord have this respect and deference to him then his secret will be with you but it begins with that respect so once the respect is established once the relationship's being established his secret is with you and he will then show you through that relationship his covenant so where there is mutual respect there's relationship where there's mutual respect there's fellowship there's relationship and it's in the context of that relationship that there's intimacy and that there's going to be true fellowship so if the relationships if the respect's not there the things that may be said and done they're not going to hit the mark if you don't have the relationship you might say well i'm i'm the dad i should be able to say it but if you haven't developed a relationship with your children in 40 years it may not be time to speak up you can't just say well i'm the dad i can say whatever i want no have you established relationship and you'll find that the teaching we receive from the message of the hours children begin to enter into their teen years pray for me that the relationship changes to where you begin to be more of a friend right why because the relationship always needs to be there because that's what's gonna form the context for help it can't always just be pointing to the fact i'm the dad i'm the mom i'm the head i'm the boss no there has to be some fellowship there has to be a mutual respect if it's gonna be productive so now stepping further barriers are artificial boundaries a barrier wants to present itself as a boundary but in fact it is what it is it's a barrier and barriers then become the context for forced relationships a barrier is going to force either separation or it's going to force a connection or force some sort of interaction uh that produces a shallow artificial relationship relationships that are fraught with barriers are shallow relationships that are fraught with barriers are usually forced and there's a coercion there's abuse and manipulation so barriers are artificial boundaries but boundaries are the true limits where there's boundaries there's personal identification where there's boundaries there's personal responsibility that that you understand and you know what what you must take care of and where there's uh boundaries exist and clearly defined relationships if anybody's thinking about starting a company and having a lot of employees you better have boundaries so that people aren't stepping on one another's toes and so everyone understands the part that they've got to play and so boundaries are are part of clearly defined relationships and is and it's those boundaries that are going to clearly define who you are going to clearly identify what your responsibility is and is going to help distinguish delineate between responsibilities and identity and that's how you can have relationship if we were all just sharing a jail cell tonight we would get along by force right and we'd have to start using different elements of psychology to figure out well i i have been when we talk about drawing a bigger circle some of us just think that means putting one another in a cage together and so we got to figure out a way to get along we got to figure out a way to do this got to figure out a way to i need to figure out a way to survive tonight because i'm in a i'm in a cage with a lot of ruthless people and i want to make it till the morning that's not relationship but where someone has a distinct boundary and someone is comfortable with their boundaries and they're calling in then there's a way that those people can begin to interact in a respectful way to produce that three-fold cord to produce uh that continuity and harmony that's going to allow the church of god to rise above any challenge and so those barriers must be respected and this is my thesis if not there is a relational consequence so barriers produce shallow relationships so those things can be just shifted around and it's just going to stay shallow but where where there you want to have true continuity and true fellowship it's in the violation the movement and the disrespecting of boundaries that have a relational consequence there's a cost to a relationship when a boundary is neither set nor respected pride paradox setting limits love has limits all of those were all about respecting boundaries god's boundaries must be respected right we have to respect god's boundaries if we don't respect god's boundaries there's consequences it's the most basic simple teaching uh that we could even bring out of the scripture in the very beginning god took chaos established order and said there's consequences if it's violated and so the very first lesson we get in scripture is hey if you out go outside of god's boundary of his word brother and said there's nothing left but judgment so we must respect god's boundaries or there's consequences and the word teaches us it admonishes us and it's very clear in a number of different contexts that we must we must establish boundaries and we must be very zealous to defend them not necessarily separate from truth but in harmony with the purpose of god and then it teaches us how to handle those who disrespect them are you still with me because this is where it gets gooder gets even more applicable first corinthians chapter 5 9-13 we've been all over the book of corinthians first and second corinthians there's such a beautiful continuity amongst all the different statements that are being made and in first corinthians chapter 5 verses 9 to 13 i love how god just gives you the liberty to speak speak plainly and he says this in first corinthians chapter 5 verses 9 to 13 i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators and a company speaks of personal it's more personal uh we were talking about thieves llc well maybe you don't want to be a partner with the thief but this is now you said you don't want to have company with a fornicator he said i wrote to you before you don't have to have company of fornicators and it speaks of a more of intimate conduct not that you wouldn't have any association whatsoever but it speaks to something personal uh there's there's a meaning behind that yet not all together with the fornicators of this world now what do you mean brother paul or with the covetous or extortioners or with the idolaters of this world for then must ye needs go out of the world right if we were not to have company with uh uh with fornicators and those are their covetous extortioners idolatry then we would just like take us out of here wins the next rocket ship to space put me on the moon we'll form the first colony but he's all be believers who aren't extortioners you know he's saying we'd have to just leave this world he says but now if you think he was going to liberate you to where it's like you know what you can't avoid them so hang out with them gets even tighter but now i've written unto you not to keep company same word if if any or this one is speaking to that uh to mix to to be personal intimate with if any man in a fellowship relationship context not necessarily carnal knowledge or a physicality if any man that is called a brother don't keep company with anybody that has called a brother and they are a fornicator covetous an idolater a a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat don't keep company with a brother who is a fornicator or as covetous or a dollar tree or or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one no not to eat which would have been more of a close fellowship and and akin to what the jews would have understood under their law conduct that would have been forbidden under the law but what i then this is uh him explaining for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person all right let's all agree that's that's pretty heavy right that if somehow somebody who's called a brother is a fornicator coverages idolater rail or drunken or an extortioner we can't keep company with them we can't sit down to eat with them and then he goes so far as to say put away that person from among yourselves now before we just come up with the oh here's a rule all right this is the rule we got to do this we want to ask ourselves why what is paul hitting that why would he have this uh this standard and to also consider what underlying issue paul is addressing when he says don't keep company don't sit down to eat put them away from yourselves because there is a principle that paul is looking at and there's something some overarching theme something that's very very important and he's kind of looking at that and saying that with if these things are working to undermine this then you've got to take appropriate measures to be very very zealous to protect this and if you look at the characteristics of this brother who is an idolater a fornicator obtains things by force is greedy loudly insults is unreasonably influenced or intoxicated or drunkard this is the way he's describing this person that you need to say wait a minute is this the kind of person i need to be close with idolater somebody's uh there there's a specific application that fornicator who's someone who's forceful obtains things by force somebody who's greedy somebody who's a railing loudly insults just uh speaks their mind critically a is a drunkard and i would say that each one of these is marked by boundary violations whether it be idolatry violating a boundary of god or e a person's it's an offensive each one of these is a conduct that either offends god or a person does it say anything of somebody who uh uh is acting separate from some offense that either harms god or harms a person now i'm jumping right into i'm just going to get right into it why would paul ask that proverbs chapter 22 verses 24 to 25 make no friendship with an angry man and with the furious man thou shalt not go why let's thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul paul has just said that if somebody's a they're a a complainer they're covetous they're an extortioner they're an idolater then then don't keep company with that brother because brother is going to be a context uh uh to get close you know what a con man is it's a confidence man first they win your confidence some of us are given confidence just based upon our confession oh your brother i can get close to you and he say listen if anyone is an extortioner a covetous an idolater a rail or a drunkard any one of these things he's saying that you should separate yourself and and put away that wicked person from among you because you should not make a friendship with an angry man nor should you go and be partner with a man who is furious because his conduct will influence you you will learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul there is an influence there's an impact by these behaviors there's an influence there's an impact by this conduct you either learn those ways or they'll trap you in your mind you'll either learn them or they'll become a snare or a trap in your heart so whether it be proverbs or paul it's rebuking behavior that is aggressively disrespectful because though it's a minority it can influence the whole because isn't that what levin does though it may be small in quantity it works to to invade the whole lump and in this way maybe i'm using some buzz words we ought to be intolerant of the disrespectful because disrespect breeds more disrespect and that's what paul is saying you got to stop somewhere because if you allow the word of god to be disrespected and you allow yourself to be disrespected there's no end to the disrespect that will result from it have any of the mathematicians here i know we're heavy on the math minds tonight looking out upon the congregation ever heard of the mathematical principle of renormalization and statistics okay we've got one so they've taken this concept of renormalization and they begin to apply it in a broader context to context to social issues and different things and in that way in so much maybe taking the extrapolating the mathematical principle looking at from the social standpoint this is just my the way i've tried to digest it and distill it down renormalization occurs when a group will appease an individual in order to avoid certain costs so it's like well we'll all change what we're going to do just so that we don't bother that we don't get trouble from this person let's say that all of us tonight really really like it cold but we found out so and so was coming so we turned the air conditioner off because you know how they can be when it gets cold right and so everybody just puts up with the heat and that's renormalization when for a very small minority the it kind of pervades the entire group and some of the examples i believe they use in the social context is when in a family there's somebody who is gluten free or non-gmo and it's just one person so that the family assimilates to honor and respect this non-gmo person within the family so the family itself will no longer have any gmo in their diet but then when that family goes to a larger family picnic the extended family is like oh wait a minute that part of the family doesn't do this so let's not have any non-gmo in at the picnic and then what happens eventually everyone's right eating kosher and the principle that is pointed to in this is eventually the disrespectful eventually the intolerant maybe the boisterous the the ones that paul is identifying here will eventually overwhelm the silent majority and notice that it's the silent majority that gets overwhelmed and so where there is no respect for boundaries you'll either assimilate or you'll be oppressed where there's no respect for boundaries you either need to become a boundary breaker or you you're going to be oppressed now i was going to save this statement for the end but i want to read it now and so it's and if you want to take that as your cue that you can just leave because i got to the end so be it but in your mouth and the message is your life worthy of the gospel this will just take everything and i think it'll just kind of slingshot us to the end very quickly brother man says don't fuss is your life worthy of the gospel don't fuss when the family gets in a fuss don't fuss with them your mother said i ain't having you go up there that old church anymore well you all think about that you all think about now you're letting your hair grow out you look like some old grandma don't fuss with her you notice those comments those biting comments he's like don't fuss with her say okay mother it's all right i love you just the same and i'll be praying for you as long as i live now don't fuss temper breeds temper notice the conduct of the mother and we need to be careful there sometimes because we see our children acting childish so that we want them to see how they're acting and so we respond or we get frustrated we respond in a childish way and just what happens we're just all being childish and the kid hasn't figured out what maturity is yet right well i hit them they hit me i guess we hit each other when we don't like what someone else is doing so they just repeat the cycle and so he said temper breeds temper when the mother is being catty when the mother's doing the things that are offensive when the mother's doing her part if you respond in kind you've just given birth to her spirit now it just gets it it becomes a dynamo temper breeds temper remember what paul told us to do in those situations he says it recognize the detrimental impact that a person can have upon you your spirit don't be friends with an angry man don't go with the furious because you'll either learn his ways or become a snare to your spirit this is this is in practice now brother says temper breeds temper first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from you you'll be fussing back then the holy spirit takes its flight temper breeds temper and love breeds love be full of love jesus says this will all men know you are my disciples when you have loved one for another that's the fruit of the holy spirit love and did you know you're a little creator yourself you know that certainly you've seen people you just love to be around you don't know why just love that that just that loving type of person have you seen that just as kind there you you like to be around them they create that atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation then maybe not a lot of amens but this could maybe be the doorbuster here then you've seen those that every time you shun them all time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there he's in here now he's going to talk about this man and they're going to do this and tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around them they create then he says seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things that you think on and and he's kind of summarizing now the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere and and he uses something that kind of gets all of our attention we can immediately begin to relate that yes i know there's people that i really enjoy being around i can be myself i i i can be open with them it's a and i and i love those kind of people and then we can immediately think of people they're seemingly nice but yet there's just something about the way that they act the way that they talk the way that they live and you're not jumping at the opportunity to be with them i said because we're all creators one person is created in a positive environment another person has created a negative environment environment and he uses that to substantiate the principle of don't fuss don't mix it up don't get entangled because whatever spirit you're being confronted with if you don't address it properly it'll only breed the same thing in you because temper breeds temper disrespect breeds disrespect and and that statement to me is just so powerful so let's let's back up in what paul is saying because he's just made some very uh incredible instruction hey don't keep company with the brother who are these things who is these things and put away from among yourselves that wicked person now that's very forceful but again we want to understand it in context so let's drop back to verse 1. we just read 9-13 we're going to read verse 1. if you're like hey wait a minute you did it out of order it just seemed to serve serve this better to do it that way it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his father's wife he's saying even the gentiles would blush at your conduct now we could spend a lot of time maybe drilling down on that but notice really what's this issue is their response i i mean we could just we could almost put it in the sense that well that's never going to happen so this is a one-off this is an outlier but what paul really takes exception to is their response to it you're puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you like the the way that you've responded has not addressed the situation properly he says you're puffed up you should have mourned and then he gets then he kind of uh gets very forceful for i barely as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already i didn't even need to be there as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our lord jesus christ when you are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ okay paul to deliver such a one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus paul is saying that this is a sin that's amongst you that is an embarrassment and it's a shame you've been puffed up instead of a mourning and addressing it properly and he says i've been able to judge this from afar and so he tells them what they ought to do the next time they gather now he's specifically referring to this offense and he says the next time you get together deliver this person unto satan for the destruction of the flesh not that the person would be completely and totally destroyed but that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus so now the ultimate goal is salvation not shame not protection of their own testimonies and boy we got to look out after how we look and and in the pretense he says no so that the spirit may be saved in the day of lord jesus and he says your glory and is not good and then this is the principle we all so often hear know you not that a little leaven leaveth the whole love why was it so important to address this conduct why was it so important to have the right attitude towards it not so that you could show off as being somebody who can be heavy-handed not so that you could be the one oh you know what we really dealt with this we really know how to do that he's saying eleven leaveneth it corrupts no you're not that a little eleven eleventh the whole one purge out therefore the old living that ye may be a new lump as you're unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness this is what he's dealing with this leaven of malice and weakness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth now without being dismissive of the actual scenario and the context of the things that paul is saying the whole purpose of addressing sin the whole purpose of addressing this transgression against in this family context as he said that one should have his father's wife the whole purpose of addressing this is to stop the spread of sin the whole purpose of identifying and dealing with was to stop the spread of unbelief to say that's not right what happens if something goes unchecked what goes what happens if we don't have the right regard for it so paul is advocating in this case for strong protection for strong response he's advocating for the walls of protection to be put about the city if you want to look at the context of the church he's saying listen we ought to have the right attitude towards this we have to fortify our strengths we ought to fortify our walls and we ought to have the right attitude towards this sin as david when he was caught in his sins said all build up thou the walls of jerusalem likewise this church ought to have seen this and said we need to build strong walls we need to have parameters we need to have boundaries we need to respect the word of god we need to respect the house of god we need to do that not only for the sake of us but for the saving of that soul the truth we recognize this through the the abundance of scripture that implores us to do it we must be available to help someone in their need we must be gracious we must be kind we must be considerate who is thy neighbor which one was neighbor to the one that had been befallen by thieves and we realized well we have a duty to humanity we have a duty to those who are agreed we have a duty to help out but this does not make us available to enable every detriment it does not make us available to enable uh to participate in compromise or to help somebody who's conducting themselves in a detrimental way or a way that transgresses god's word how else are you really respecting somebody when you're enabling them we must have respect for each other we must have respect for boundaries we must have respect for sincerity and truth he's saying that we ought to keep the feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth this is all within the context of him saying that you should deliver this one in this instance to the to satan for the destruction of his flesh that a spirit may be saved and your glory is not good don't you realize a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump and i wrote to you before saying don't keep company with those in the world who are fornicators but you know what i'm writing on you to not keep company with a man who's called a brother who does the same thing why because 11 leaveneth temper breeds temper disrespect breeds disrespect the wrong kind of behavior over time can be renormalized and then what happens you show up and you see it because you're an outsider you're like oh my goodness what is going on this is crazy but everybody on the inside is kinda like hey no this is this is the way we love one another right it's just kind of been renormalized over time well that's just the way we function that's just the way that we that we act and the people who are kind of caught up in the middle of it have renormalized and they don't recognize how incrementally they've strayed from the proper conduct that is becoming of a christian we address offenses since i even practiced preface this with how not only does the word tell us we have to set boundaries but it also teaches us how to handle those who don't respect them again you may say well this is very self-serving you're putting these scriptures in the context of boundaries well okay we can change the words if you want but paul is talking about somebody who's done something wrong and tells how to handle it and we address offenses transgressions against god's word things that personally offend us we address offenses as a way of establishing truth we we do this as a way of defending truth because paul says it that we ought to keep the feast getting rid of the leaven of malice and wickedness but keep the feast with the bread of sincerity and truth in other words we do this as a way of shedding the pretense this is we're not just we're not forced into fellowship here we're not all just gathering as those who've been i got the i go to jail card and here we are we just found ourselves at the corner of this board game on a wednesday night this is not forced it's something where we're shedding pretense and in doing so the pretense are all the barriers he says keep the feast the unliving bread of sincerity there's no pretense in this it's not the shallow relation it's keeping the feast where we're not all just doing it playing church but there's some true harmony true respect you are in your place and i respect it i'm in mind and i respect that and we're all working together in harmony and who we are and not some sort of forced unity which is the spirit of the day right the spirit of the day is forced unity so paul is he's talking about how you address an offense and a tough one too but we can gather from that that paul is telling us that there has to be a way that you can take that you can handle or i mean he's he's even taken it out of context and saying hey i've told you that someone claims to be a brother and they're a fornicator they're covetous they're an idolater they're railing a drunkard or an extortioner have no company with them because of the influence now in matthew chapter 18 i'm just going to read three verses and and amplify this for the remainder of our time this evening matthew chapter 18 verses 15 16 and 17 moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee to trespasses to go beyond a boundary that may be the terminology that we even recognize most often is to trespasses to enter unlawfully to enter without permission to enter without relationship are you catching this more of a if i brother do something inappropriate because it doesn't it violates the context of the relationship it violates it offends moreover thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone one of the most important aspects of this is you first go to him and it's with him and him alone you don't have anybody else involved you're going straight to him and if he shall hear thee i'll go ahead and just read through it then go back over it if he shall hear thee thou has gained thy brother notice that phrase thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more then in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he shall neglect to hear them so you've gone to them yourself and and yourselves alone just the two of you now you've gone to them with somebody else and if you neglect to hear you then tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church so even in saying intelligent to the church the church then responds in such a way to they they bring the offense to the brother that they're going to affirm and acknowledge the offense bring it to the brother now he's not just hearing the person who's offended he's not just hearing the two people that the person who's offended brought now it's coming through a little bit different channel and this whole scenario right let's just think right now if all of a sudden i said all right brother west we're taking you before the church you need to hear something and we're all going to be sitting here going and you'll get it get your attention right and jesus intends for this to sound like an attention-getting measure it says but if they neglect to hear the church and this you say wow that escalated quickly let him be unto thee the person offended as a heathen man and a publican so let's go back over this if thy brother trespass against you it's an act against you or he offends you the word trespass in the scripture means to miss the mark he's violated something as it pertains to you if he's gone beyond a boundary if he's entered unlawfully if he has without permission done something if he has done something without relationship if he has if put in such a way to where it seems very subjective he's saying if your brother offends you then go to him and him alone and if i can say this it may seem putting that that way that a trespass is to do something without permission a trespass is something that offends you it may seem that i'm trivializing the conduct and then it kind of exaggerates the response but consider the steps and the recourse that jesus demands that's very simple if you're saying well so you're telling me that if i just happen to whip into front of somebody in the parking lot and park in front of them even though i didn't see them and they're all up hot bothered about that and i offend them we're supposed to go through this yeah i would say that fits because think about what jesus is recommending he's teaching us how to behave towards someone who's offended us and even if we could say uh uh you're too sensitive or whatever it might be teach us if you are offended if someone is trespassed against you he's teaching us how to address it and then he's saying if he won't respect you he says he's saying avoid him right and john wesley had this comment to make about this scripture he says jesus lays down a sure method of avoiding all offenses whosoever closely observes this three-fold rule will seldom offend others and never be offended himself okay let's commit this to memory right he said if we could somehow observe this if we could somehow catch this and i believe he's expressing the idea that to closely observe it would to be not only uh compliant with the letter of it but also in harmony with the spirit of it there there's something being taught here that if it can be quickened to us we recognize it then immediately we start looking at how that we would like offenses to be addressed whenever we experience them but now we've become enlightened right we've tasted it now we now we know how it feels now now we're being our eyes have been under we have been enlightened to it now it's not so much about how a brother should treat me when i've been offended but now i'm a little bit more cautious and observant and aware of how i might come off to somebody else and this instruction and i think this is especially important for us to recognize that in the way that jesus is expressing this the instruction is to the offended person if thy brother trespass against thee you individually go to him and you alone it's one individual to another it's an instruction to offended person it's not so much a rule to the church where this is this church has got this kind of in their weapon cachet and we're going to use it whenever we want it's not it's not used as a weapon it's not used to empower the church it's a very deliberate teaching to the individual that when you're offended you have a recourse that you can go to the one who's offended you if he won't hear you you can go to him with other people who can also hold them accountable and you you accountable and if you won't hear them then you're going to bring it before the church and so it's it's for the individual because he says then let him if he doesn't hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican okay are you with me now let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican in other words regard him as treat him as a heathen and a publican respect him as he then view him as consider him as why would he be as a heathen man and republican we know the definition of heather right we could put just unbeliever reprobate we're not even given the benefit of being a make believer he's an unbeliever and then to say as a publican jesus at one time was characterized as being a friend republican and sinners so that that may have some weight even in this subject but it's he says they are to be as the unto thee as a republican go in the scripture republicans that were those who had a bad testimony they had a reputation they were of poor character right i mean we're drawn from our bible knowledge the publicans were just those who just they did things for all the wrong reasons jesus when he's deriding them of how you treat one person over how you treat another says don't republicans do the same right not republicans don't get offended the publicans and it's oh and they're saying that this is just the way they have a demeanor they have a conduct they have a reputation it precedes them oh that's just so-and-so right that's just a republican and and jesus is saying that if you go through this threefold process and they don't respond treat them as a heathen man as a publican that's serious all right so walk walk with me through this i'm running out of time so i won't i won't maybe dramatize it not that i had thought of this tremendous beautifully embellished drama that i could do begin to act out cue the smoke brothers bring the lighting down no let's just walk through this you are offended a brother trespasses against you you go to the brother and tell him his fault between thee and him alone and a true believer a christian someone who is spiritual will respond to the first effort maybe maybe not so much initially but that effort in itself jesus is saying it's i i i if i want to say well i'm infer in it that's fine but i believe it's implied in the context he's saying you know what if you go to him and him alone and you know not not all big right the the approach and even i want to get into this maybe more sunday it's not big time in somebody because there's a way especially if you don't appreciate relationship you're they're never going to be honest with you it's not it's never going to work out the right way it's just going to be a confrontation but he's saying that if you go to him that first attempt is probably going to produce a oh man i offended you i am so sorry right and then if we take a step beyond that if you go to him and say hey man that offended me that i'm telling you my fault he's like yeah well i think you're just making a mountain out of a mohill and whatever the response might be when you show up with a with two other people even a professing christian would be moved by the second attempt right or at least the third professing christian a member of the community a member of the church i you know looks at the one brother and brother two and brother three and says you know what i'm sorry i just i don't feel like i need to apologize like okay fine then one day you get brought before the church is a somebody who's just a professing christian somebody who's just even a make believers i'm like all right i'm sorry okay i'm sorry it's implied that even a brother who's trying a professing brother let alone a true brother he's saying would it would not fail to listen in that moment so when he says if he hears that means he understands and acts appropriately use this phrase you've gained thy brother it's very important uh that you're that you're right close with me right now and if you it's if you feel you find yourself waning a little bit i say just ready yourself stay yourself with all that you have in you and focus very uh intently right now he says you've gained thy brother it has a direct has a direct meaning that you've actually recovered him from his heir you've rescued thy brother when you see a brother taken in a fault ye who are spiritual restore such a one through spirit of meekness and fear can sit in your own selves why do people not restore you there's no spiritual people to do it they just run off when you've offended them talking about it right instead of doing what jesus said and going to them and them alone and saying hey this is where the ark this is where the fault is this is where the disagreement is he says if he hears you you've gained a recovered thy brother you have rescued him from his heir and you say well how look at luke 17 1-2 then said he under the disciples it is impossible but that offenses will come amen right we're like good because i'm offended all day long but woe unto him to whom they come oh never mind right we can't just say well i'm you know we're just defensive i have a right to be offensive it's my right i tried to offend and just get kind of caught up in the political rhetoric he says but woe unto him through whom they come it would were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast in the sea then that he should offend one of these little ones all right do you think he's being extreme is he just trying to make a point well perhaps but i hope you get the point you'd be better that you'd be have a millstone hung around your neck and you'd be cast into the sea than to offend even the smallest and the least and so jesus is saying that your rebuke may save the offender from this judgment because he says you tell him of your fault between thee and him alone when the brothers trespass that when you go to him this is getting very very to the heart of god now please if you could uh gather your your resources now and channel this in your heart he said that if you can go to him and tell him of this fault then if he hears you you have received him from the judgment and this is what strikes me and if you feel like i well i'll just say it this way do i care anymore maybe maybe i want to say do we care anymore that when there's been an offense that what jesus is saying that if you are a son or daughter of god where there's been an offense you may be hurt but but you have healing as your promise you have eternity as your destiny this one stands in the place of being better if a millstone was hung around their neck than to have offended you and then it should be uh well is there not some is there not some care and this to me just i was so resonated with me we you wonder why you're so greatly impacted when there's an offense you wonder why even your body bears it at the scars and the physiological breakdown of the stressors and the agony why do we agonize over things like this why does it hurt so deeply it's not just for our pain alone but also for their loss could it be that it's not just my body is saying no but it's the church body saying no it's the body of christ saying oh no don't let this person be lost in their arrogance don't let this person be lost in their pride so he says you've gained thy brother there is an aspect of recovering him from his sin but then there's also this aspect of restored fellowship you've secured the relationship because the the the scenario hey listen that offended me i don't care okay offender this is brother tube of the three on brother one you've offended me i don't care all right offender we the church want you to know that you've offended brother number one what do you say i don't care all right you're not our brother anymore right you're to be to us to this offender you are to be whether you want to look in the context of church because it's certainly implied elsewhere in other places you are to now be as a heathen man and a publican so if he hears you though you never get to that part relationship's secured position of a brother is affirmed and then that becomes the conduct context for conduct among people between people but if and i realize i've already said it and kind of looking at the inverse if him hearing you through the process gains thy brother saves him and secures the relationship if he does not hear you the reverse must be true likewise you lose a brother because you've gained thy brother but now if he's to be under thee as a heathen and a publican he's saying that you have now lost your brother there is a there is a way of brotherly fellowship that ceases there's a closeness that is lost he's saying that at one time you could fellowship under this context that you are a brother because a brother trespassed against you you went to him as a brother other brothers went to you as a brother the church within which you are part of a brotherhood went to you but now that the process has not achieved any kind of resolution or any kind of understanding or acknowledgement and affirmation on your part then we can no longer deal with you and have a relationship with you in that context everything changes do you realize where there's disrespect of boundaries there's a relational consequence it means to cease to have true christian fellowship to no longer regard him as a brother to no longer respect him as a brother we could go back to psalms 25 14 that where there is no respect there is no disclosure of personal things there's no conversation that is intimate there's no there's no sharing of things there's something that is lost in it now lest we let our pride grab a hold of that and and run with it you still own kindness you you still owe them help if they're afflicted because we are to love our enemies and to love our neighbors as ourselves so even if they are the declare declared to be your enemy you still love them too many of us are operating under sun tzu's orders of the enemy of my enemy is my friend they've shown there's a consequence it is our duty to god to draw a line but it's also our duty to the offender what if we all just kept our mouth shut what if god did the same thing well i just want to be a loving god so i don't care how they baptize i you know just i i don't it doesn't really matter to me right if god operated by that contact just think of how things would be we owe a duty to god to draw the line we owe a duty to the offender to draw the line we are all a duty to build the boundary to defend it to clearly demarcate these things notice how paul continues in first corinthians chapter six verses one to five dare any of you having a matter against another go to the law before the unjust and not before the saints this is to me informative to the process that jesus expressed notice what he says do you not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters this is this is coming down to everyday life and this subject that we've been exploring and think all this may seem petty this may seem trivial you're going to judge the whole world should we not then begin to exercise judgment in our daily lives should we not begin to learn to stand for and and to espouse the virtues of a feast with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth should we not then be able to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church now he's really done something really clever there right because we always want it to be the pastor right the deacon look at him before the board you always want it to be like this imposing mob they said hey you got a problem let those who are least esteemed in the church he says i speak this to your shame why these people were puffed up is it so it is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between him his brethren so what did paul express in the prior chapter for what have i to do to judge them also that are without chapter 5 do not ye judge them that are within but them that are without god judges therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person this is the function of judging if you're going to be tasked with judging the whole world start by judging yourself start by judging properly clearly defining boundaries within your own home within your relationships because we are to judge in the smallest of matters and judge things that pertain to this life again let's come back to it why influence why why should i have any of you ever had an experience where you let it go too long and you wish you would have done something about it sooner because now there's so much momentum it's gone so far you think how in the world how in the world can i ever get this back to where it ought to be it's the influence the reason why we're asked to do these things this is very practical in these scriptures that we've read tonight whether it be first corinthians 5 and 6 luke 17 or if it be matthew chapter 18 these things are there and taught to us because the ability of an offense the ability of a trespass the ability of these things to oppress and the baiting nature of them is jesus says it or as paul is even expressing it the leaven leavening and then brother bran i'm zeroing it around and says temper breeds temper it's the ability for disrespect to breed to breed bitterness right remember keeping our spirits clean and how things begin to defile and corrupt and it begins to channel and pervert our behavior so jesus says in luke chapter 17 verses 1 to 3 we read it a moment ago it is impossible but offenses will come but woe unto him through whom they come it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea that he should offend one of these little ones take heed to yourselves are you taking heed i'm heeding brother aaron take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him rebuke us to reprove brother reggie brought this out and even brought it through the church book sunday night that uh and the youth meeting we had in our home that the rebuke is to reprove it's it's this uh calling this exposing with the aim to correct some of us kind of like the aha exposing but just for the sake of exposing not with the desire to correct he says rebuke him and if he repent forgive him i'm just reading what he said i'm not trying to put a spin on that at all if thy brother trespass against thee reprove him expose the fault between you and him alone this is kind of the condensed language here in luke if he repent forgive him remember though he's saying take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him remember think about this the offender's also in danger don't lose sight of that the offender is also in danger that we are taught in many different instances in scripture that there's we're to rejoice when we're mistreated that we're the sufferings are going to come and the persecutions are going to come and they're going to mock you they're going to revile you they're going to mistreat you're going to do all sorts of horrible things against you and these things are going to happen and and listen if the world hates you know that they hated me to begin with and the worlds are the devils and they're lost and there's no recourse for them and then we're thinking wow yes i need to take it patiently when i'm buffeted but now when it seems to come very close and it's a brother that trespassed against you you need to remember the offender is also in danger of loss but also take heed to yourselves because there's a cost there's a consequence therefore guard your heart keep it with all diligence because there's a price that's exacted from you through these offenses there there is a there is a a detriment to you and then when you realize that our instinct might be whoa i want to get way away from this as far as possible but then when you're reminded that the loss is greater for them you risk the loss of thy you risk the loss by approaching it right you risk that knowing if i don't temper breeds temper musicians if you could come this evening and the message awakening jesus jesus is when he's expressing the instance where virtue was taken from jesus and he said virtue went from him he says virtue is strength now that principle is very large in itself but notice how he says in other words if we'd say today he got weak when the people drawed off of him well if it worked that way in that human body it'll work in another human body right you catch the principle he's just elicited that christ in the context of being uh um uh who he was and one approaching him and and using that gift themselves and drawing that virtue from him it drained him of that virtue and therefore he's uh uh if something's taken away from he says in modern language he got weak when the people were drawing from them and he said hey if it happened in his human body there's still the same principle that exists today it'll work in another human body and we can think of how when others exercise the gift in brother branham's life it drew virtue from him but notice what he talks about and we create our atmosphere around us each one of us you've been with people that were nice people but you just couldn't hardly be around them then you've been with other people that you just love to be around them right oh come on none of them are here that you don't want to be around so you can stay as man as loud as you want i the neighbor from next to the apartment next door is not here hey we can say whatever we want we can amen as loud as we want saying there's people that you they're nice but you can't stand to be around them but there's other people you love to be around them what is the what is the uh amplifying this idea of things being taken from you right the idea of being in a situation that is exhausting can i get a witness right the idea that when there's some people you're around you're completely drained you're spent you're exhausted it wears you down it's not virtuous there's others when you're around even though you may be given there's something that seems to be reciprocated in it that if you were doing all the water and you somehow watered yourself and you feel good about it why because it's the dynamics of those that take take take take take and others that when you give give give give there's something you get in return people that you love to be around others that you just can't hardly stand to be around even though they're nice people he says you create that atmosphere you have the ability either to be the one that is always taking and always one being dour always the one bringing down or you can be the one that's always building things up he says and all wouldn't you love to have been around jesus just a little wonderful see what that atmosphere he created would have been i imagine it was just one great big bundle of love and respect and godly fear and that can give you something to aspire to be that can give you something to aspire to create a kind of atmosphere where it's not just always critical it's not always just for for volity it's not always the kind of atmosphere that others leave and go ah that kind of sullied my spirit oh that kind of dirtied me that drew things from me that made me feel exhausted that made me feel negative that made me feel sad that made me that changed my attitude it changed my perception don't you want to be the kind of person that has a virtue to give where it's love and respect and godly fear and that's what others are drawing from [Music] i think this is very very practical for us to consider if you could stand with me this evening i believe it's very practical for us to consider
