TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's known amongst us now just ask if he would come and take the bread of life and feed it to us our gracious heavenly father we are gathered together tonight in your name we're gathered into a natural building one that may be set aside for different uses but lord we as a vessel are set aside for one use that's yours so father come now not just inhabit these walls and move along these aisles but lord make your presence known deep within our souls lord may it resonate in a place to where we can walk from here having been shook by your word and knowing that we remain father as i know you desire to speak to your people tonight i say come take the bread and break it to us lord touch every soul that is here tonight touch those who would be streaming lord even in the peculiarity of the subject matter or [Music] would lack tonight father so we commit it to you and pray your blessings upon us now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i'm going to be reading from john chapter 6 and so while you're turning there we wanted to make a couple of announcements and the first one is that beginning in february uh february 3rd it's wednesday february the 3rd we are going to be meeting in a new facility and it's where we had our very first service as a church back in july and some of you may not even realize that that's how far back we started but we had our first service in july um at the hilton garden inn with this at this address and this facility has certainly been very kind to us they've been very gracious they've worked with us uh they just had a scheduling conflict and so uh we didn't didn't begrudge or we didn't feel that god was frustrated and all of a sudden god was looking at his calendar trying to figure out how this happened we just took it in stride knowing that the lord will provide and so brother mike has worked very hard on trying to identify another interim facility before the lord blesses us with that surprise which will be our our building our next building hopefully one more permanent than a hotel um and i'm sure there's uh this type of setting up and tearing down creates a certain desperation amongst different individuals and i believe it'll be their cry under the lord that'll cause him to come down and deliver them from their task masters of a pop-up service and so we appreciate everyone's labors and the works that they're doing um to facilitate this but beginning in february february 3rd which is a wednesday be in prayer for that service because it'll be our first time there with this new setup and having the the entire thing so beginning wednesday february 3rd and then continuing through the month of february that's we'll be meeting continue to be in prayer as it's our desire to find a more permanent facility and there's many that are working very tirelessly to do that and we appreciate it the next announcement just to repeat it this sunday night there's a youth service at 4 pm and that's correct right it's 4 p.m and then and there's a sign up sheet for those who desire to participate in the food and everyone's welcome to come i believe we we have a youth group that's going to enjoy it but also those who desire to be here and create the atmosphere and be a part of it you're welcome to be a part of it john chapter six i'd like to start with verse 47 and it's one of those chapters that um you you'd like to begin you start reading where your text is going to be then you go back a few more you go back a few more and before you know it you want to start with genesis 1 1. at least here it'd be very logical to start where jesus multiplies the loaves and the fishes and how that in performing that miracle there was those that were drawn to that type of that type of manifestation and jesus even chastised those that come and says that they've come because their bellies were filled naturally and because they wanted to see more miracles by way of loaths and fishes and that's what prompts him to go further into what we call the opening of the word we might identify as the third pull of his ministry but where jesus isn't just emphasizing signs and wonders and the multiplication of loaves and fishes which satisfies the hunger of the body but he begins to open up the word of god and point to the word of god even the body word of the son of man and that's what really feeds and that's what really attracts and so that's kind of the context for what we're reading and i'd like that to be kind of in at the at the forefront of your thoughts as we go forward tonight so verse john chapter 6 verse 47 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life what bread of life that that bread that comes down out of from god out of heaven and he says your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die not the natural bread not even the bread that your father's ate in the wilderness he says i am the bread of life eating me produces life brings life i am the living bread which comes this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and notice this and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world and the jews there have strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat so they're they're wrestling with the semantics they're wrestling with the rhema of what he's saying unable to catch the thought behind those words and they're thinking this guy wants us to eat his flesh and his blood brother branham says what is he a vampire and then jesus having discerned their thoughts could have said hold on i think you misunderstood me and tried to explain it but he just it seemingly aggravates it by even putting it in more controversial terms and jesus said unto them verse 53 verily verily i send you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the father as the living father hath sent me i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever amen you can be seated well that's exciting exciting to read that and i trust that i'll be able to come back to it here in a few moments i um well i almost forgot in the midst of all my announcements the most important one if i'm making the announcement and it's sister elizabeth mcgeary's birthday today so i wanted to i wanted to say that and i thank god i didn't forget i want to mention a few things just to connect the last couple services we've been ministering on we're continuing on the subject of a family this subject is so heavy on my heart tonight and so pronounced to me and it kind of captures some things that i had not yet uh maybe explicitly read to you or shared with you but have formed the basis for um this inspiration on this series that started within the beginning and evolved to in the beginning god created and what we've been looking at is a family and i i think we may be able to just even summarize things tonight such that if the lord would lead us to um go further into the subject of a family and the different roles uh we've laid the foundation how the god in the beginning here in genesis the first few chapters is is giving us an expression or an image of what he would like us to be so just a few things at the outset we've looked at how in the beginning god created a family and last wednesday we're looking we're looking at how god has arranged us together with particular responsibilities to one another and in doing so that created an agreement or covenant between among ourselves and amongst the different family members with rights and responsibilities to each one in on sunday morning we looked at proverbs 17 17 says a friend loveth at all times and the brother is born for adversity and there is a there's a way that you could use this to suggest that your natural flesh and blood you will strive with and there's adversity among siblings but the the meaning of this phrase that's meant in the hebrew and it's certainly referenced in other ways in the scripture that a brother is born for time of trouble and a child even a child is born into the family to be there for purpose a child is just not there as a consequence of an act but a child is born into a family and by virtue of its birth it has a purpose and then even as a child it has a purpose and you can see how that a newborn though helpless brings joy to a family and it allows a woman to step into that office of a mother allows a man to step into the office of father and it brings forth emotions and feelings that neither could have ever imagined and i can still remember the very moment the exact moment that elliott was born and then realized that there was feelings and a love and an affection and a an instinct to protect that i could have never fathomed before and so it took that child coming forth and it served a purpose even in calling men and women to a higher calling and to fulfill the role and responsibility as parents and then even for that child as they begin to grow they have a purpose within the family they have a responsibility even as a young child and maturity reveals the greater utility of that person and their duty as they would grow to the age of accountability and as they would grow further to be a young man or a young woman that would enter into marriage and that brings forth the responsibility of a spouse and then when they enter into parenthood so what i'm wanting to maybe use in that way as a child is born into a family a brother is born for a purpose and the scripture here just mentions that singular purpose of you have us you have a brother you have siblings you have family members to be there for you when you can't help yourself and when you need mercy and so i'd like to use it in this language that there's a scriptural covenant among the members in the family and that word covenant is a scriptural word we might say contract we might look at it as an agreement brother branham says a true family they're all in agreement and love one to another we have a scriptural covenant or contract between family members among family members and it's an obligation that we owe one another and it's an obligation we have to one another just as brothers and sisters in christ there's obligations we owe one another just by being human beings uh we have an obligation to be honest no matter who it is uh we have an obligation um to deal with one another fairly and to a and to do good unto all men and these are things that are established by scripture uh that we have a responsibility to all men and so there is a scriptural covenant and we were emphasizing that last wednesday that in these relationships and how we interact with one another in the duties that are imposed upon us by the word of god give us an opportunity to express god's character and how that relationships bring things out of us that we otherwise maybe would not have an opportunity to express now in genesis chapter 2 verses 15 and 17 we were identifying verse 18 in great detail in services past and it says in the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it so he has put man on earth with a purpose he does not just say he created man and kind of threw him out there into the world but as he does it he gives him a purpose he is commanded to dress the the garden and to keep the garden and then he gives them this verbal commandment and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat now when he refers to the trees of the garden that he may freely eat he's referring to those that grew out of the ground which were good for food and then using symbolic language but representative of something that god had tasked the man with he tells him that he's placed man there with the covenant to dress the garden to keep the garden and now he tells him you can eat of every tree in the garden and that certainly connected with the commandment that he had and now he cautions him in verse 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die this is god giving adam something for him to keep and it's put in this context he says if you will he's telling them commanded to eat of every tree and if you eat of every tree of the garden you're free to do so but there's a tree of knowledge of good and evil that thou shalt not eat of it for if you do if you will keep my commandment and not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you will live forever but if you don't in that day you'll die now this is what brother adam referred to as the eden covenant he referred to it in another place as the adam covenant so god had brought forth a son he had brought forth the daughter god the father with the son and daughter then established a covenant with his children called the adam covenant or the eden covenant and it was the family of god arranged together to to one another with rights and responsibilities with the covenant between themselves but then also a covenant that they had with god that they are to eat of every tree of the garden for that for just the sustaining of the flesh and to to enjoy but of this tree of the knowledge of good and evil if they ate of that then they would die so i'm just using this and i maybe might have done served me well just to say in the beginning just kind of stay with me i just feel like i'm i'm going to be going down a path very quickly tonight very focused very direct and just hitting it one after another so i appreciate your attentiveness tonight but god gave man genesis chapter 2 verses 15 to 17 god is giving man a word that he must keep this is the one thing if we join it with genesis 1 28 this is one thing we can point to said god put man on earth to dress and keep the garden god put man on earth to be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and have dominion over all the all the all the creatures and over the earth and that god also told him that he had to draft that he had to not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil we could put all these scriptures together and say this is the eden covenant this is the covenant that god made with abraham if you will do this you will live forever but if you don't you will die and so this is something that as long as adam kept up his end death could not enter in now if you look at verse 15 again it says and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it so this speaks of responsibilities that the man and the woman would share and i want to identify this here though we could we've done it in other places but i want to just use it right here when god says he put the man in the garden of eden we know that the garden scripturally is symbolic of a spouse and so there's an image of a spouse being something that is kept that is protected that is looked after and so he put the man in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and this arrangement that god places the man to the garden is even symbolic of the responsibility that the man would have over his wife it's it's uh symbolic of the responsibility that adam would have been given over the woman and so in the message satan's eden brother branham refers to this image of man and woman in the garden having faith in all his word his seeds brought an eden of holiness love and eternal life that's what god's eden produced holiness and we looked at this in great detail in a couple services last year he says and it brought an eden of holiness of love understanding perfection and eternal life so this is brother branham describing what was in the beginning a perfect eden that came forth by god's word by his seeds producing he says that's what that is what god is planting his word his seed so he planted it then now there's something that's been planted that's going to come to maturity and he says that's what his church will be at the end it will be the same thing what is it going to be it's going to be like a garden it's going to be like a garden which was planted by god that brought forth seed that brings forth fruit that produces the very fruit of god it's the manifestation of the word of god that comes forth in its fullness just as god wrote in isaiah and this vineyard i will keep i will water it i will protect it i will make sure that it's fruitful and it'll come forth brother branham saying that god has planted this bride he will bring her forth in the end she will come forth as an eden of holiness not satan's eden but a guard another garden of eden it's the tree of life restored back to him she stands radiant in the fruits of god uh being born through her flesh through her body and brother branham's saying that's what his church will be at the end she's going to be in eden so there's this parallel that we've identified how that the guard is representative of a spouse that the bride is likened into a vineyard and that the bride in the end is going to be an eden of holiness of love understanding perfection and eternal life so in ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to 28 paul says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so now paul is speaking directly to husbands and he's telling them that they're under a scriptural duty to love their wives and to clarify that duty and to even whether whether you want to say to qualify it or to clarify it he says the standard by which i am asking you to love your spouse or to love your wives is to do so as christ loved the church and this is a love which is not necessarily demanding in what you can do for me but as a sacrificial love because he says love your wives as christ loved the church who gave himself in service to his wife and the service and this giving and this attitude that he took towards the church was that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so this produces a parallel that a husband has a responsibility if he loves his wife as christ loves the church that there's some sacrificial service that when he does this it sanctifies and cleanses his wife and then it says that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now this is placing before us a particular image that we understand is produced by the word of god and by a perfect man right and he's asking us who are not perfect to love our wives perfectly and to use this as our standard and he's not setting it up so that we would fail but it's to take us out of a mindset maybe a carnal mindset out of pictures that aren't correct about these relationships and and stabilize them and center them and place them as they should be because after he has set forth how christ loves the church he says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies so though you may not be able to do to your wife what christ is able to do to the bride look we can't give our wives a new body that will never die right but we can help her look after and care for the one that she has so we're not saying that there's some sort of parallel whereas he can heal we ought to be able to heal and where he can forgive sins we ought to be able to forgive sins in the same way that he does but there's parallels how that we can respond and react and live for our wives that christ has done spiritually we do so within the context of our marriages naturally and that's not what i'm emphasizing i'm just trying to bring these thoughts before us so so what meant to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself and and i would have liked to have read more how he begins to talk about how no man hates his own flesh and then he speaks of this mystery of christ in his bride but paul when he when he uses these this admonishment to the man what i want you to pick up is that he's hearkening back to the original marriage agreement that paul is not using moses's treatment of marriage he's not using some other reference point he's actually going all the way back to the beginning and he begins to speak how that for this cause shall man leave his father and mother and they shall be one flesh and i i did leave out that out and it would have been appropriate to read it and that's how we see that paul is drawing from the original marriage covenant so if you want to go back and read that more plainly i accidentally just cut this a little bit short when i was trying to shorten up my notes this afternoon paul when he's speaking this he goes back and he quotes genesis chapter 2. he quotes this unction for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother so when paul says husbands love your wives as christ did who gave himself who he labors that he might sanctify and cleanse to present and to keep free from any harm he's telling us that we are now to live under that covenant or in likeness as christ loves the church he's bringing us back and pointing us to how it was in the beginning because adam was asked and this is where we can see the parallel he put the man in the garden to dress it and to keep it to dress means to work for another to serve another by labor so adam was tasked though he was god and though he was the lord and though he was the the most supreme one on earth he had a responsibility to work for another to serve another and this duty was to the woman there were co-laborers together and it says to keep which mr guard protect or to save life and we can see that adam walked in the parallel and he lived that parallel his brother madam dramatizes to us or expresses it to us this way that when the woman fell that adam went to her and acted and the way that he acted actually preserved her life and so i'm just kind of laying this these things out in seed form that there were duties and responsibilities that adam had to keep and the woman had to keep and they related to one another and it related to creation and paul is referring to duties and responsibilities that a spouse ought to willingly keep and they relate to this eden covenant you can see parallels in the even eden covenant now this is the statement that maybe fi that becomes this turning point and it connects it to where i want to go next brother benham writes this in the church age book god's intention for his creation man is to express his words doesn't that just put it so succinctly that what what what did god want to do he wanted his words to be expressed how is he going to achieve it not just through creation but through man he says god's intention for his creation we say well the things of god are known in the creation around us but he wants to bring it down to this this particular expression that man mankind adam and the woman were his intent in bringing them forth was to express his words he says in genesis adam was given the word to live by now ponder that god's intention for his creation man was to express his words so in genesis god gave adam a word to live by what does that tell us that living by the word would express god's word and so when he gave adam genesis 1 28 when he gave him genesis 2 15 to 17 this was the how that god's word would be expressed he gave him a word to live by if adam kept that word then the word of god would be expressed and even all the mysteries that had not been uh verbalized in the creation and laid there in seed form adam would have brought them forth and they would have expressed been expressed as he just lived the life just lived the life according to the word god's words would have been expressed so brother branham brings it this way which to me summarizes it so well a life lived by the word would be the word expressed now we often think about the full word being born into manifestation and the seven seals were open and what was that that was the open of the word to reveal christ and we can use very we can use a language that describes mysteries and thunders and seals and the book of revelation and the third pull and all these different terms and we love it it's fantastic it's energizing it's inspiring but there's a point at which we can just start using using these phrases to keep getting lifted up and lifted up and at some point we can actually kind of leave the very realm that god wants it to be the most relevant in because if the third pull is the revealed word if the third pulls the open of those seals to reveal christ then there is a revealing of christ in a spiritual realm there is a presence of jesus christ when he is here now revealing himself to the bride making himself known to the individual there's a marriage that's taking place there's a union that's taking place but brother adam says that that's not the fullness of the word being expressed the fullness of the word being expressed is when a life is lived by that word so when you have a life lived by the seventh seal when you have a life lived by the third pool when you have a life lived by the seven thunders that's the word being born into full manifestation not just as brother branham expressed it when he preached the seals not just as he preached christ as the mystery not as 63 64 and 65 unfolded and then we put the period there at the end of his ministry and said that's the full word being born into manifestation but when you even if it's just one of yours takes the word of god and lives it that's the word being born into full manifestation again even if it's just one and if it's only going to be one i want to do everything i can if i'm not going to be that one to help the one who's going to do it do it i don't want to stand in anybody's way if i'm not going to do it then i want to help somebody else do it i'm going to say well if i can't be the one that brings the full word born into manifestation then i don't want them do i say lord my way even to get into eternal life at white throne judgment is to serve some purpose and do something right so i want to help that one if there's only going to be one because a life lived by the word is going to be the word expressed so the expression of the word in the end time cannot come apart from it being lived and so as we could bring this picture out more fully in the garden of eden in greater detail i'd like just to maybe put it in this way so we can just use it as a building block the life that adam and eve lived according to the word according to that covenant would have been the word expressed that adam covenant that eden covenant they would have kept that that would have been a life lived according to the word and that would have been the word expressed now if i could put it this way what i want to do with this is a foundation and uh it's it's 7 47 so i'll try to pilot this you know to to an early close but i want to use the remainder of this service to give context to all the relationships we have he said well that sounds like a pretty lofty idea it's very simple but i want us to ponder what kind of relationships we have to one another what kind of relationship i would have to a friend the kind of relationship i'd have to children the relationship that i would have to uh within a church officers amongst themselves and song leader to congregation however you'd want to look at what's the context to all these roles and responsibilities we have what's the purpose of being a brother and a family what's the purpose of being a son or daughter to a father and mother what's the purpose of being a wife and you try to make sense of all these things and what i find what's the most easy thing to do is to get lost in all the relationships and the responsibilities and feel that they demand so much of our time and our energy and we get so stretched then that those very relationships and responsibilities to children responsibilities at work and all these things that we have to do they begin to weigh us down because we feel as if they're taking us away from the word of god and the purpose that we have in this end time but what i want you to be able to see that though it may weigh you down if you're fulfilling your purpose in that calling there's no loss in that weight that that there's no there's not two separate things where you've got the word of god being born into full manifestation and if i could just somehow not have to worry about being a husband if i could somehow just stop worrying about paying the bills no there's got to come a revelation that takes all these things over here in the natural harmonizes it with all these things in the spiritual and sometimes what it takes is for you to truly understand how the spiritual longs to have harmony and union with the natural in order for it to have real expression we could sit around all day long and talk about a perfect bride and feel really good about ourselves as long as it's just some kind of ethereal thing that's just kind of out there nothing ever really that has to be concrete and lived out but he wants it lived out and so in genesis chapter 3 verse 6 i i'm just going to be throwing out some principles um even on this aspect of the eating the asp aspects of a covenant and new covenant just some things out there to kind of give us a little bit of a push further and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree desired to make one wise this is in direct contradiction to what god said about the tree god never said this tree was good for food and pleasant to the eyes means it was lustful to the flesh it wasn't something that was just pretty to look at it describes the fruit in the beginning that was pleasant to the sight that meant that it was a something that when you looked at that it was actually it was physically beautiful but here there's something being stirred up inside of her as as we've i think i've made even the statement here i've been hungry before but i've never looked at food this way and this and the meaning behind the scripture is not how one would look at a meal says in a tree desire to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under a husband with her and he did eat so there's something now that they both did we know it's symbolic we know it's representative of a particular act so when she says that she saw that it was good for food let's not just think in our minds that it was something that was good to literally eat but rather it was something connected with something else and she thought it had use to bring forth something else just as god told him in the beginning that of all the trees that grow out of the ground of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat what would it be good for for sustaining life sustaining flesh it would be something that they could enjoy but now when she saw the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that god said it's not that you should not eat it she saw that it was good for something in other words she saw something in that to live by she saw it as something that would bring life this is good for life this will make us wise this will cause us to mature this will bring out some further expression of us so she took in it and then she gave it to her husband they're not physically eating they're not literally eating but it's symbolic of of of life coming forth or procreation so it relates to just re uh fulfilling responsibilities assuming particular roles and it relates to life it relates to relationships and so in and i hold that remember that she saw it was good for food it was good to live by it was something good to bring forth life it was something that would enrich relationship is something that we ought to do as a course of life and so when the woman did this she breached her covenant to adam which was her husband and we say also to god because she was under the requirement not to do so but then adam broke his covenant to god and so and we know there's certain representations in that but notice now the eden covenant the adam covenant was adam if you will then you will never and now in doing so he failed to keep the conditions of the eden covenant he failed to live by the word so in what he did this was not the word being expressed he left the image he left the blueprint he left the direction that he ought to go and so the breach of the covenant is expressed symbolically as eating we realize this is something symbolic and in that eating and partaking of it it brought forth death and this is him failing to keep that covenant now in luke chapter 4 brother branham tells us that the temptation of eve in the beginning was is represented in the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and the temptations of the woman in the garden of eden correspond to those three different things that are in the world then brother branham teaches us that the temptation of christ corresponds to the temptation of eve so as the eve as e the woman was tempted in the beginning by the serpent christ now goes into the wilderness and he's tempted of the devil and the temptation of him relates to the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and jesus in answering he says well commanded these stones to be made bread and eat of them that was to satisfy this hunger that jesus had in his natural body but he says it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god in matthew it speaks of the word of god every word of god that proceedeth everywhere that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so it's this is the construct we know that we live naturally by partaking of fruit or bread and in the beginning adam and the woman would have eaten of every tree in the garden that grew from the ground and they would have lived but as long as they didn't eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil they would have continued to live now jesus says that man cannot solely live by just satisfying the flesh man cannot solely live by making sure that he has provision of what he may eat and what he may drink and how he'll be clothed and where he may sleep but man has an obligation to live by the word of god so eating means more than just what you do when you sit down for lunch or you sit down for dinner but eating represents the manner of life it represents the way that we live the way that we conduct ourselves it has to do with our thinking it has to do with our speaking it has to do with our conduct it's not just the act of eating when she saw that it was good for food it didn't just mean that she was hungry but it spoke of something that she would do something she would act and something that would bring out another calling within her life when jesus says man shall not live by bread alone it's not just the eating he's referring to but we must live by the word of god this is this is this is now you can see this was the covenant in the beginning but now mankind is being introduced to another covenant because god established a new covenant so that the purpose of his creation would be satisfied god didn't start all over again but he made a conditional covenant with adam he made a conditional covenant with noah but what happens in genesis chapter 12. this is an unconditional covenant and i realize there's some paradox to it but when god made his covenant with abraham that was one that he has not annulled or broken even if abraham stumbled in it even if israel stumbled in it god made a promise he would bring forth a seed and guess what he done it amen the seed which was christ came why did it happen not because man kept his in but even though god was requiring something of abraham requiring something of israel god said you know what i will i will i will it wasn't up to abraham it wasn't up to somebody else but god said i'm going to do it i'm going to see that it's done through your weaknesses through your failures through your ups and downs and you're in and out i have made a promise and i'm going to keep it and so with adam conditional covenant with noah conditional covenant with abraham in genesis 12 if you read those first few verses this is an unconditional covenant and christ is that seed through which all the seed of abraham is to be blessed now christ i just want to use this very quickly in matthew chapter 26 verse 28. when he's saying take eat of the bread this is my body which is broken for you and then he says he says drink also of this cup for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for the remission of shed for many for the remission of sins the new testament the word testament there is covenant this is my new contract my new agreement this is a new disposition or arrangement of things he's introducing a new order not dependent solely on what we will do as it was with adam not dependent upon us as it was with noah be saying this is the new covenant which is the blood of the new covenant which is shed for the remission of sins so now i'm going to do this and with the shedding of my blood it remits your sins it's going to bring you into fellowship so that you can be new creatures and paul amplifies this new covenant through many of his writings and so with this idea now that christ then becomes this new covenant the one that's the bearer of a new covenant the one that says this is valid this is enforceable this is the new agreement that i write with you this is the covenant which i will have with you that i will keep with you that i will wash you of your sins and that i'll write the word upon your heart your sins and iniquities will be remembered no more against you god giving this foreshadowing in the old testament that there's going to come a new covenant there was when adam send consequence when noah sent consequence but now we say look i'm going to make a covenant with you that is so unconditional that your sins and your iniquities will be remembered no more against you and it's not like he just sets a restart date and says all right from this moment on everything in the past i've forgotten but if you make another mistake then sorry you got one shot at it it's not even that way am i right or am i right all of our sins past present future he has told the elect listen i've atoned for it amen so well i'm 45 years old and i've been sinning for 45 years i accept your forgiveness lord thank you i'm washed i'm cleansed i'm justified i'm going forward and then you make another mistake and he goes oh man you should have waited to claim that you should have waited because you can only use it once and and listen this isn't a board game where you can only get out of jail once with that card and then you forfeit it he's basically told you this is a new covenant that i make with you and we're under this new covenant and under this new covenant this is now the connection i want to make and i feel like this is just the pathway we have to go to understand this not to understand it rather but for me to express it but under this new covenant it fulfills the promise of the original covenant because god has not abandoned what he wanted to do in the beginning and he has not said well i'll start over with christ but rather christ is the seed of genesis 1 20. christ is the seed of genesis 3 15. christ revives and resurrects all the potential impossibility that the first adam had and we're taught that we see that jesus christ is acting even in john chapter 6 by multiplying the loaves and the fish is showing that something that adam lost in the fall is being restored back to mankind and so now christ then is introducing to us the new covenant by new birth we're brought into this new covenant and that original covenant is made void by eating right it was void by conduct it was void by the way that the woman acted by the way that the man acted now just to use a few statements to show that under this new covenant we are now under an unconditional covenant with god that he will through us fulfill what he originally desired to fulfill in genesis 1 and 2. listen to how brother branham writes this this is in the revelation of jesus christ chapter 1 of the church age book as adam and eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years we understand that that there was not a thousand years lived by adam and the woman he says now jesus our last adam and his eve now let me just and he says true church so let me just step in here and say this that brother branham is he could have finished this statement by saying and i could try to cover it up so you don't finish it and so that my thunder's kind of stolen here but he does not just say that adam the last adam and the true church will live out a thousand years in the millennium he's not just saying that because we know that's true that we will do that and that's done to fulfill things that were lacking in the beginning and things that didn't happen in adam and the woman it's kind of that that honeymoon that man never lived out he says jesus our last adam and his eve the true church will fulfill what all the plan of god so it's not just limited to a thousand years on earth in the millennium it's actually he's saying look whatever god's plan was in the beginning he is summoning up his climax in it and he's finishing it through the true church can you can you catch that i think there's so much weight there i want you to understand that he says that christ and his bride will fulfill all the plan of god as initially expressed and given to adam and the woman whatever his plan and purpose was remember his purpose was that a life lived by the word would be the word expressed now the bride is going to fulfill that potential he writes in chapter 5 of the church book by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin so now there's a language that he's using that is not just exclusive to a millennial reign that is not exclusive to just one provision but they will fulfill all the plan of god and now whatever potential that the woman held in relationship to her husband she will now fulfill all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin this is not something she can do by herself this is not something that she could have done without adam but it's representative of that marriage covenant the potential the man had the potential the woman had to bring forth the word of god in its fullness to bring forth that son jesus christ he's now saying that now in the last time the bride will bring forth that word because it was promised to be done in the woman it was promised to be done in the church both of them having failed and meeting their potential the bride will realize it in the end and now a statement brother brennan makes in christ is the mystery of god revealed and again if you if you'd like to recall this one side where it's the headaches of this life the responsibilities domestic responsibilities our work responsibilities all the things that we're having to do and then over here the seals are being open christ is revealing himself the son of man is here feeding on failing body word of the son of man washing clothes feet we see in christ united with his bride the mighty angel one foot on the land one foot on the sea going to work every morning and and we start seeing this and that and this and that but what i want you to see is that they're just going to come to the place where they harmonize and they begin to work together and they're not two separate things they're things that god established for a purpose you think you're just working here and one day you won't have to work he says we're going he talks about the land beyond he says we're going to work actually says we're going to work so if you don't like work now well you may not enjoy the the land beyond the river so to speak so we're going to work we're going to have fun there's things we're going to enjoy right brother makes this statement of christ is the mystery of god revealed he says the anointed man this was a much larger statement that appeared down just to this point says then the ointed man which is christ the last adam the second adam he has the capital m there just like it would have been in genesis 2. now the anointed people i would say this this is aaron mcgeary the anointed woman the bride oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the anointed bridegroom so christ is that man he's got to come back the bride has to come on the scene he says anointed by accepting what eve turned down and adam so whatever she turned down we have the opportunity to receive and in receiving what she turned down we can fulfill all the plan of god we can fulfill all that was promised to be made manifest in the virgin anointed by why accepting what eve turned down at and adam he says and adam and the way that this is phrased i think you could even put it a little bit differently accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit christ the second adam coming back the anointed word see anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept amen oh man i love the third pool i love the opening of those seven seals all seven of them are opened and i love how he's making this plane to where it means something to us as a member of the bride by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was made promised to god that god promised to be made manifest in the virgin now he's saying that we as bride right now have the opportunity to receive what eve turned down our bridegroom comes back and we accept and then we are able to be the anointed bride the anointed word which she turned down to be and we have that privilege we have that opportunity to be that now again that sounds like really fun you know saturday night convention type stuff everybody like man you would just love to be able to preach that in south africa and tell everybody to please be seated and they come and they start beating on the pulpit and i've been preaching places where they just come and grab you while you're preaching you're going like will this end and it's but it's not just to get excited though these things do excite us but listen there's more to it than just how it kind of itches it tickles our ears in john chapter 6 as we've already given some context to this this is what we could say is christ not just going back to the first pool second pull of his ministry the loaves the fishes the signs and wonders but pointing them to the fact that there's a word that i'm bringing you that you must accept there's promises being fulfilled don't just get hung up on the things that i do that make the flesh feel good or remedy things in the flesh but there's a word that must rightly divide the soul that you've got to receive into your soul and that in receiving that you become there's some change that takes place on the inside and he's saying he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life remember how eating in the beginning caused the fall then he says that man shall not live by word of bread alone but by every word of god and i said i am that bread of life your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that man may eat thereof and not die now there's a parallel what adam and the woman ate in the beginning caused death now christ is speaking of something that if you eat you don't die it's akin to that very tree of life that jesus god said look let's guard the way to the tree of life left man eat of that and live forever now jesus is saying i am i represent something i am the bread of life if you eat this bread you you will not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world jews therefore strove among themselves and how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them john 6 53 verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you so it's living it's life it's vitality it's purpose brother man talks about how that if you had the life of an artist in you you would do the art of that artist so life isn't just well i'm living i'm breathing but it's something that has character has integrity it has an expression it has a dna that needs to be unfolded so there's something more to it than just being say well i'm never gonna die but how are you gonna live listen i do not believe this promise that we're never gonna die is all that we're thinking about that we're never gonna die but the fact that we're never going to die ought to change the way that we're living if i'm never going to die well hey then i can live a little bit differently than everybody else has lived in ages past and that doesn't mean i try to get away with doing dirt but it means i'm under a promise and a power now that's going to give me provision over anything that would have taken death before anything that would have taken life or anything would cause you to despair of life anything that would defile emotions or disrupt the harmony of the physical body if that's the promise i'm living under it's not just so that i can wag my finger in the face of death but that i can lift up life now so that life could be lifted up right now so he says this uh whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day so you have life in you there's consequence i'm going to raise them up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me i live by the father i mean this is just catch the language he lives by the father just like we live by from meal to meal we live by the natural elements he said this is something that characterizes life so he that eateth me even he shall live by me life living character conduct thoughts actions deeds this is that bread which came down from heaven what did the jews think is he literally talking about us eating his body and drinking his blood what is christ talking about there being a substance that when you eat it you live by it what do you mean live by it everything everything you do not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever so christ is that tree of life this is a contrast to genesis 2 17. if you eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil the day you eat that of that tree you shall die but now christ is saying here i am the bread of life the bread from heaven that if you eat of this you'll never die now there's a parallel i know this has been ministered before and to great lengths through the decades of this message unfolding and the men of god lifting it up and preaching these great things and these great truths and establishing us in them we see a parallel of how christ's ministry followed signs and wonders and gaining crowds and certain attractions and they gather they see what he did in the multiplication of the loaves and fishes he crosses the sea and they all show up and he says you've come because your bellies are hungry you come because you want to see more of the fleshly things you want to see the healings you want to see the signs you want to see the wonders but what did he do he didn't put on a show for him he opened the word he began to speak the word the truth of the word the revelation of the son of man the deeper things and it's those things that offended them and caused them to walk away so what christ is talking about here that a man will eat of bread and live eat of bread bread and have life eat of him and actually have a particular way of living that's the third pull and so the type that we see in genesis excuse me in john chapter six in this hour the eating of the unfailing body word of the son of man is to have an effect in us not that we can gather in coffee shops and in churches and around around tables and sit around and talk a language that other people don't understand but that we can live a life without ever opening our mouths that causes other people to get thirsty to actually live a life so does that mean i can't make mistakes does it mean i have to live above reproach well that's our objective i don't think we want to tell everybody you know go ahead and leave tonight and and just try to get your mistakes out of the way first in the morning so you could try to live a little bit clean in the afternoon we'd say oh god just help me help me lord to walk in your will help me to live a life that's above reproach do we make mistakes yes do we fall short of this of this yes but we're believing in a god and a power to raise us up above it and so this third pool as it's expressed in john chapter six when he's talking about eating bread he's talking about living a life it's not just something that you eat in secret and and nobody has a clue that you're eating but it's something that means something to us maybe i could put it this way the we are god knows we're natural beings and so i have as natural beings the scripture says your heavenly father knows you have need of those things he knows that you're concerned about where your next meal is coming from he knows that you're concerned about whether or not you're going to be able to uh to make a mortgage payment he knows that you're concerned about what you're going to eat what you're going to wear where you're going to lay your head he knows that you're concerned about providing those things for your children so he says i know you have neither of those things but seek me first and all these things will be added unto you and he he makes promises to us things that we can count on and things that we can bank on and these things that that means so much to us in natural life god is so mindful of that he harmonizes them with things that mean so much to us spiritually things that we would hold very dear and very precious to us about god fulfilling malachi 4 5 in this end time and luke 17 30 being fulfilled in this end time in first thessalonians 4 16 being fulfilled in revelations 10 1-7 being fulfilled and all these great precious promises that we could say this day this scripture is fulfilled it's those things that if we are seeking them if they're coming to us as a revelation if we're feeding on those things they translate to god being present in your natural life and making a difference and all these other consternations and worries and fears and all these other relationships we have and that's when it's really going to matter the most that's when it's really going to be the full word born into manifestation now in the message possessing all things is a very lengthy statement that i believe i have broke up into just two sections here oh but i just love this so much how prophet makes this connection don't miss the prophetic connection that brother brennan makes between the third pool and the everyday lives we live and the rapture this is what i want you to see is brother brown's going to reference the third pool then he's going to connect it to the lives that we live and it's connected well i will raise him up in the last day this is not just brother brand i'm accidentally stumbling on a scripture but it's god actually using a prophet to reference a scripture that we can put our promise on here in the last days when there's going to be a bride what raise up when you hear a word and you're raptured up quickly to meet it with these things that take place where she is now risen he says you're feeding on unfailing body word if you haven't done it to give you strength to fly above the denominations and all these things so eating on the unfailing body word of the son of man gives us strength to rise up and he says this he says in saint john the sixth chapter jesus said whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day that promise isn't that a glorious thing i will raise him up can are you with me to this to this juncture this is john chapter six this is him reading from these very scriptures i i he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has a life and there's a promise in the end where they're gonna be raised up he says did you ever think what you are here for now this is this is where it gets real now to your children what are you going to school for children and so think about this i'm trying to look at my children jack why do you go to kindergarten have you ever thought about it elliott what do you go to school for eliza preston wherever you are what are you going to rowan what do you go to school for he's over there giggling at my kids and he's like ooh what do you go to school for now we're thinking about this what are you working for dad somebody got the children in it we got the dad in it what makes you get up mother of a morning and get the kitties to school wash their face make up the beds and cook and do it all now this is a very interesting line of questioning to go down he just read from the third pool john chapter six he that eats the body word of the son of man i'll give him power to raise up at the end time and we're like whoa glory to god hallelujah third paul bring it to me come on baby speak that token language and now he starts asking us why we go to school starts asking us why we work he starts asking us why we why we why moms get up in the morning and wash their kitty's face now he hasn't all of a sudden lost his notes oh my goodness what have i done i'm working on another sermon all i'm in question and answers now what do i do these things makes these things connect these things are so relevant together he says come in all wore out and the next day start the same thing that's what that's what we do the man goes to work the mom works all day at home the man works all day making a living the kids go to school all day and do their homework and then what do we do the next day we do the same thing again he says what do you do it for back to the dads why do you labor and slave dad and everything come in at night and weary one of the kids get sick you walk the floor cry pray struggle they get well then back and you do it again every sunday wash their faces get them down to the church this is the routine right this is where we have this in our minds i'll just say this for myself i'm like if i can just get through sunday and then i'm like once i get through sunday then i'm gonna be all caught up and i'm gonna be in a groove and we'll start we'll do this and we'll do that and everything's gonna be great and then monday it's like you're behind again you start all over and it's monday night if i could just get through sunday right and then monday comes and what do you say again if i could just get through sunday just seems like there's always something you're chasing he says and well what's it all about what what are we here for is that all there is to it is in doing that he's not he's not getting us to question why whether we should do it but he's saying do you even realize why you do it did you ever think what we're here for why are you going to school why are you working why are you taking care of your kids why are you praying for them when they're sick why are you bringing them to church what's it about what are we all here for it continues he said my that'd be miserable knowing you've got to go anyhow what's it all about oh brother it's examination time it's an opportunity time it's the opportunity to accept this tell me something to take its place tell me something better than that produce anything in the world be the king of the earth rule the universe be a crucifer or a kennedy or whatever you wish to be you'll just die just the same oh hallelujah do you realize he's just said that whatever you're doing as a housewife there's nothing to take that place whether you be a khrushchev or a kennedy or a king of the earth what you're doing the role you have the opportunity you have is greater than all those things right you don't know what time will come by any minute but here when death does strike you've got eternal life and can't die with the guaranteed by god of all creation who's the possessor of heaven and earth i will raise him up again at the last days and notice this tremendous prayer help thou my unbelief oh god fill my soul o god cleanse me fill me charge me send me out let me not die let me live to tell the story this is what it means i'll raise him up in the last days this is why brother brennan makes this connection and i would love to go much deeper into this great connection but brother branham is setting before us this image that the son of man has revealed himself again today to his bride that you have the privilege and opportunity to feed on that and jesus is saying i if you eat this flesh and drink this blood i'm gonna raise you up in the last days what has he raised you up to do wash your kids face in the morning go out all day and work come back home sit around the table do a devotion and start it all over again why what gives reason to that what gives purpose to that the very thing that god's called me to the very thing that's given me a life and unction to do it oh help thou my unbelief oh god fill my soul oh god cleanse me fill me charge me send me out let me not die let me live to tell the story let me go to every cracking corner of the earth and preach the word and sow the seed yes sir that there may be a harvest in the last days of the true unadulterated word with believers in christ he's taken the word which we believe this opening of the word we're in this hour we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and he's asked us what are you doing all this else for and it's all fulfilling that what can take the place of that tell me something to take its place tell me something better than that what do you mean if you disagree with the emphasis i'm putting on let me just say this way what can what would be better than to take the place of the role that you have within your family whether it be a husband or wife what would be greater than to be a father of a mother what would be greater than to just take your place in the body of christ to take your place within the family of god to do your part within the church so what would be greater to be a kennedy or a khrushev to be a biden or a putin what would it be this is the statement that i i wanted to read it earlier but i've saved it to this point or moved it to the end here god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from eden to the rapture and here we are the the word that god gave them in the beginning they were to live by adam wasn't to do anything more than just live by it and if he lived by that word they would never die and it's that same word that we live by and what's it going to do bring a rapture so then what are the mechanics that we worry that we're worried about live the life just live it you say well how about there how can i do it well what do you what are you going to school for children what are you going to work for dad why are you doing everything you're asked to do mother that's it that's the secret that's that's what we that's all we can do it's not holding our hands a certain way when we pray it's not saying oh lord please bring back the conventions of the 80s and 90s where we all got together and there was thousands of us and and these preachers preached and the revelations came and that feeling we got the presence we got listen we're living off the benefit of that now and we're going we're going further than the word of god and what we know we can do the lit the the one thing we can do it's the only thing we can do in many ways but it's the best thing we can do in this do what you're supposed to do because the eden covenant that adam failed we are now under an unconditional covenant and what do we do we just live the life we live it the way that he asked us to live it brother branham when he's referring to the unconditional covenant it's unconditional not i will i have i've already done it he says and that's the law that christians must live by it's already done i mean this is there's it's kind of a it's an odd thing that you've been asked to come to he's inviting you into this relationship and then by union really the revelation is it's already done he's taking care of it now who do you say this is brother ben says god may manage this tremendous prayer god made men and women no longer hold on to traditions and creeds but may they come out of that thing give their lives completely to god and believe not just try upon theory and things of man but trust in the living god while these holidays are going on the cry still is who is this what is this what's it all about see the question that's echoed brother branham echoes it in possessing all things what's it all about what are we here for is this all there is what's it all about he's asking this question from the standpoint of a prophet looking into the prophecies of the word of god that relate to the last day these challenges what is it all about what is it all about and now he's saying that laodicea and the nominal world they have this question who is this what is it what's it all about religious people say the same thing and it's the same lord jesus made flesh in his people anointing his word for the bride did he not say that this is what eve turned down he comes back and we accept this is the anointed word he says and they can't understand it they're all so tore away and laodicea until they don't know what it's all about can i just admonish you as believers don't be all so tore away unto laodicea that you don't recognize your day and its message that you are now living in a bright age also torpin all the demands upon laodicea that you don't realize you're in the time that the lord jesus has made flesh in you we give our lives completely to god and believe genesis chapter 18. i i i must i must finish this let's go through this very quickly genesis chapter 18 verses 1 to 8. because he said he brings this contrast of laodicea and the same lord jesus made flesh in his people it's the son of man being revealed again in human beings in the bride in your flesh but people are so tore away in laodicea that they don't know what it's all about now maybe there's a way that we can put ourselves in that even though we are the ones who the lord jesus is making himself flesh in this flesh is becoming word and we really we know this we repeat it we accept it we hear it preached way amen we feel some connection with it it's kept us very in very dark times when people we love have turned their back on it there's something there he said well i'm tied to this is more than life to me i may not be able to explain it and things may not be the best for me right now and things may not be going very well and you may be able to point out a lot of things in my life and a lot of circumstances and i may not look like much of a believer but there's something i'm tied to that's more than everything i see and more than everything i feel and you know this word is true but then we could ask ourselves what's it all about so tore away on laodicea so there's some there's a deeper connection that we need to make with this revelation this word that we have been given to sweep us into a rapture and in genesis 18 brother battle uses this scripture so often to speak about the sign of the son of man revealed the sign that the son of man is being revealed and it says the lord appeared unto abraham it's unto him in the plains of memory and out it speaking of abraham he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground so if we could just use it as some sort of image or type abraham's there he's near his tent he's in his domain he's in his property he's doing the things that he would do there at the heat of the day there's maybe certain things at that time of the day he may have been taking a break trying to be in the shade taking a break from the labors that he had as one who had a vast kingdom and as he's sitting there resting from his natural duty he sees these men approaching and he runs to them just a normal day there's nothing about this day that suggests that abraham was told that this is going to be the biggest day of your life he's just there he's at the tent door he looks up and he sees and he said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight and we see that how there's three but he recognized the lord pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree now recognize some of the things that are taking place here comes the lord who stepped into a body and here's this one veiled in flesh and he comes to abraham at his house he showed up at his house and now abraham immediately is able to do things hey let me go fetch you some water why because that's something he customarily did let me wash your feet rest yourselves under a tree he had all these things and i will fetch you a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore you are come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said abraham says why don't you stop let me feed you let me wash you why don't you rest a little while and then you can continue your journey and abraham with all the things he expressed that he wanted to do they say we'll do it we'll stay and then verse 6 i love this and abraham hastened into the tent unto seven now sarah was in the tent i said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the earth now he wouldn't have asked her something to do that was out of that she wouldn't have normally done or knew what to do he didn't go into her say honey you need to make a cake eight feet tall it needs to be gluten free and make sure you have pomegranates i always just say hey this is something she would do every day she'd make bread she would need it and so now she's being asked to do something that she would have normally done but we know this day is a little bit different than any other day because now the lord's there now god is veiling himself in the flesh to bring a promise to him and so he said honey go make these cakes and bake this meal and abraham ran into the herd and festive calf tinder and good and gave it to the young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and a calf which he had dressed and he set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat is this a beautiful picture i mean are you can you get excited about this that abraham has god visit him god veiled in flesh comes to his tent door and everything abraham does is what he would have done any other day where they sat is where they would have always sat what they eat is what they ate what she made is what she would have made any other day maybe what they would have done to any stranger that came their way they're now doing it but they're doing it in the presence of the one that made the promise in the presence of the one that says i will return unto you about this time next year according to the promise of life and sarah shall have a son here's abraham just doing what he would have done any other day christ comes and visits him and he just keeps doing what he'd done every other day but now it's to christ now it's to him who is present with him abraham was living a life when he came and he continued to live the life in his presence and what does this tell us that when christ himself has descended we don't need to get so spiritual that we're of no earthly good we realize now in the presence of christ i will love my wife now in the presence of christ i will reverence my husband now in the presence of christ i will do what a man ought to do what a woman ought to do what a child up to do with more authority and boldness and more confidence than ever because he that both will and desires is in me to do it and i can release my cares to him and he can accomplish it amen what a beautiful story my we could tell the story of god veiled and flesh the mighty angel coming down the earth taking the book and eat it and all these different things that we can express but we see it perfectly lived out in genesis 18. amen what does it look like what does it look like when god veils his flesh and his bride what does it look like well abraham fetched bread poured milk sarah made the bread the lamb he went and grabbed it he'd been raising it was there he begins to use all these things that's what it looks like what do you do it for dad what do you do it for mother you do it for him what do you do it for because he's here what do you do it for because he said he'd raised me up in the last day well when is he going to have oh no no he raised me up in this last day to be a dad he raised me up this last day to be a son he raised me up to be a man of god he made raised me up to be a man of integrity he raised me up to be a cycle breaker he raised me up to be a bearer of his word he raised me up to be a life lived by the word that's what he raised me up for well you're not doing a very good job well then i'm going to yield more i'm going to repent where i make my mistakes i'm going to say i'm sorry i'm going to keep trying i'm going to keep trying because he's made a promise that he will he will he will he will this covenant will not fail but what a different picture in genesis chapter 19 in genesis 19 verses 1 and 2. and there came two angels to sodom and even because there's one that stayed back and what's abraham going to do when he stays back he could keep doing what he always did right if that if that angel wanted to stay with him you know what he would have said hey i've got to go check on the herdsmen about this time every day i go down there and check on them and we make decisions why don't you go with me it wasn't like all of a sudden god showed up veiled in flesh and he's like honey don't bother me you do this and guys go away i'm just gonna sit here and basket the glory of the cloud and try to think of all the wonderful types i can pull out of it and all the beautiful things that god is doing in this last days hear the voice of god and catch the types and the revelations he said why don't you go with me while i go do my job who is sarah making it for all these people interacting all these things that's what happened with as this one stayed with abraham but genesis 19 1-2 and there came two angels to sodom and even and lot sat in the gate of sodom now it's now the even in the at the heat of the noon abraham was by his tent now in the evening time when lot probably should have been at home he's at the gate of sodom i'm not saying that it has to be that way i'm just saying there's a difference between lot and abraham in lot seeing them rolls up to meet them so he does even as abraham he runs out to me he bowed himself his face toward the ground and he said behold now my lords different revelation than abraham had turn in i pray you into your servant's house terry all night wash your feet you shall rise up and go on in your ways so this sounds just like abraham sounds like abraham he said hey why don't you guys stay well wash your feet we'll feed you clothing and then you can continue on your way but notice what they say nay but we will abide in the street all night now that's that's striking with abraham all three of them said yeah we'll terry we'll sit in your home we'll eat we'll partake of the things that you want to provide but with lot he invites them into home but they say no we'd rather sleep in the streets because there's something that's unknown to us about lot something that we can gather from the rest of the scriptures that lot wasn't about doing what he should be doing abraham immediately knew immediately let me wash your feet let me go get you some milk let me tell this guy to start dressing the calf honey start making bread and he had all the things he had been in practice he was doing the things he was supposed to do and now he's able to keep continue to do it he's able to give service in the presence of christ lot's just sitting there in the gate of sodom i don't know what he's doing you know he deleted all those tweets before we could archive them we don't know what's going on and next thing you know he runs he seems like he's doing what abraham did but there's something missing in lot's life there's something missing in his revelation that when these angels were invited into his home they said no we're better off sleeping in the streets brother baton catches this in jehovah gyra part two in case you're thinking man brother aaron it's amazing how you pull that out i just read the message that's what i do let's just make it very clear right now somebody told me one time you need to tell the people where you're getting it i'm like what do you mean they know where i'm getting it i'm just preaching the message he says two of those messages went down into sodom and they preached to those sodomites and they blinded them at night at the word but remember there was one he stayed with abraham and his group they had their sign of stranger among them look at lot sitting in the gate and said my lords and living in such a way they said come into my house he said we'll sleep in the street he says what a home identifying something as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed the son of man is being revealed you can either be a lot or you can be an abraham if you don't catch the revelation to the purpose of the son of man you could use the language of abraham but you're living like lord you can recite all the quotes of brother branham but you're living like lot but when you catch the revelation you live like abraham you live the life and a life lived by the word is the word expressed not books and tapes and quotes and trying to explain what brother man and preach said i may not be able to explain it but oh god let me live it let my life be the interpretation let my life be the very unfolding of this beautiful perfectly complete message oh god fill my soul cleanse me feel me charge me send me out let me not die but let me live to tell the story he says we'll sleep in the street what a home but as soon as abraham they said there's a difference with abraham this is the purpose we come for we sit down here by the side of you that's the way live so that if god would come want to use you he knows right where to come get you you're in a position living a life clean before god your words are honest your life is true that's the kind of a place that angels come the opening of the seven seals doesn't change this it brings us to this i want to share a personal testimony i don't normally i try to insert my own but i just felt like i was really challenged today i bought i bought elizabeth a birthday gift yesterday i bought it in the store and then um and then i got an email later on saying your product will ship tomorrow i thought well this has got to be a mistake and then they sent me an email said your product's out for delivery and i was like oh thank you lord right oh this is an excellent opportunity here and sure enough they delivered the exact same product paid full price for it yesterday something went wrong in the analysis and now i had the exact same thing and nobody would have been the wiser if i kept it but something inside of me i wanted to do the right thing i wanted to sow a good seed and so i called up the store and i talked to the person who sold it to me said i want to talk to you first because i don't want to get you in trouble i walked out of the store with product yesterday and i received it's the same thing today uh but it was delivered to me and kind of the attitude was well good for you right and i said i want to do what's right help me do what's right i'm willing to return i want to take it back i want to return it do whatever is right because it's going to be kind of a complicated thing to unwind and uh and elliott knew knew what was happening and he said well did they say you could keep it and you know what the manager said he said he could keep it if he wants but you know what i want to do i still wanted to return it and let me just tell you why because one day i may make a mistake and somebody may be able to take advantage of me and i want to be made whole i don't want to be defrauded i don't want to be taken advantage of i don't want to make a mistake and somebody capitalize on so i looked at it as an opportunity to sow good seed and and and maybe just a challenge to get all distracted today and not be able to preach because it's like woohoo i got something free but this is the kind of to me this is just personally this is how i can testify it doesn't necessarily mean anything for you but for me i feel like that's an example of how that i can live the right kind of life so he knows right where to come get you you're in a position living a clean life before god your words are honest your life is true that's the kind of place that angels come look at elizabeth and zacharias and honest upright walking in the commandments of the lord that's the way we want to live so when one when god gets ready to use us he says this is my people i can do with this church what i want to they believe me they stand on my word see that's the way you want to do live the life that's it that's what we can do this is my people i can do with this church what i want to they believe me they stand on my word this is what brother branham identifies in genesis 18 and 19. lived the life so that when god wanted to use them he knew right where to come find him and that's the way liv said if god would want to use you he knows right where to come get you and i say this let's live a life where you say this is my people i can do with this church what i want to they believe me they stand on my word let's stand to our feet this evening let's bow our heads in a word of prayer if you have a need before the lord just express it in your own way in your heart feel free to lift your hand to him our gracious heavenly father your word is perfect there are things that we can read in the word and not understand there's things that we see in the word that we might from a natural standpoint feel that they contradict with some other part but lord we know it's perfect maybe there's a way that we can take comfort lord as we look at our lives and we feel that there's things that are incongruent with your word we feel there's things that have happened that don't make sense or fit within the perfect picture that we thought was unfolding but lord without the ability to change our past we just want to live out to the future and we want to look into the word now see that in the beginning you created a family and in the end you've raised one up and that each one of us no matter what our past no matter what our circumstance we stand here tonight man or woman boy or girl with a calling with a purpose and if on a normal day in the heat of the sun you came and visited abraham [Music] and had a message for sarah that all we read about in genesis 18 are things that we can do the lord i want to do what i can do i may not be called to do things that are public as it's often mentioned we may not ever go overseas and preach a meeting we may never lay our hands upon the sick and feel the charge of god raise a dead body back to life but i can do what you've called me to do i can clean my house i can cook for my family go to work lord brother scott roberts was sharing with me about his schedule and up so early and home so late [Music] seems like the same thing every day lord he wasn't complaining he was just want me to know his schedule because i asked lord i pray that you would help him to seek purpose in the long hours just as i would desire for all of us to have a sense of purpose in our labor that it's not without consequence that what we do every day to serve our family what we do every day to provide what we do every day to make a living what we do every day to get an education to work whatever it is lord what we do every day can be the very thing that we need to do to express the word what i don't express it by going home and taking a message book and showing it in the mirror i don't do it by studying prayer alone lord that that's not how i'm going to do it i'm going to do it in a way that other people will be witnesses to it i'm going to do it in a way that my children feel it i'm going to do it in a way that my wife will feel it [Music] life lived by the word is the word expressed i know sometimes lord what we say with our lips doesn't harmonize with what we do but lord i know it matches what's deep within our souls as sons and daughters of god and may we humble ourselves before you tonight with this confession and this profession that we do desire to live the kind of life so that when you want to use this you know right where to find us let me be abraham may i can say it this way let me be sarah let us be doing what man and woman ought to do not begging for your presence but in your presence lord not hoping one day to serve you but knowing that now our lives can be poured out upon your feet as incense as oil lord that our labor and our expressions and our sacrifices what we do to teach in this natural life what we do to serve and what we do to earn a paycheck what we do to feel that we did our duty as a housekeeper or spouse or mother father lord it means something to you in this great economy that's leading us to a rapture that's what i desired lord to just seal it with is it has purpose it has meaning it's the lord may we then be not like dumb driven cattle [Music] but may we realize we're sons and daughters of god with a purpose [Music] may we live the life lord may we do that father i pray we commit these things to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
