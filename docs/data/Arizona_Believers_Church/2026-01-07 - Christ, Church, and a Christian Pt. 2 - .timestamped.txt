[0:00] Acts chapter 2, start with verse one,
[0:02] read to verse 45. Then they that gladly
[0:05] received his word were baptized. And the
[0:08] same day there were added unto them
[0:10] about 3,000 souls. And they continued
[0:13] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[0:15] fellowship, and in breaking of bread,
[0:17] and in prayers, and fear came upon every
[0:20] soul. And many wonders and signs were
[0:22] done by the apostles. And all that
[0:24] believed were together and had all
[0:27] things common and sold their possessions
[0:30] and goods and parted them to all men as
[0:32] every man had need. Amen. You could take
[0:36] your seats.
[0:41] Continuing on the subject of community
[0:43] and in these first several services on
[0:45] this I'm hoping to kind of express the
[0:48] idea and the burden that I have in using
[0:50] that phrase community and specifically
[0:53] looking at Christ church and a
[0:56] Christian. And so there is a some
[0:58] definite characteristics that we're
[1:00] identifying here. And with the subject
[1:02] of community maybe with just a few
[1:04] things to pick up where we were on
[1:06] Sunday. We're identifying God's purpose
[1:08] for community. We have this innate need
[1:10] as human beings to be a part of um a
[1:12] social network or have some sort of
[1:14] belonging not just in a family but a
[1:16] community at large. Uh we could see even
[1:19] in anthropology and different things
[1:21] where it's necessary to be part of a
[1:23] group even for survival but we're not
[1:25] looking at it from just merely the
[1:27] standpoint of human need uh but rather
[1:29] God's design and why he designed us to
[1:32] be that way. why we have that innate
[1:35] need, how the devil would want to
[1:36] exploit that, but also God's purpose for
[1:39] it and it and how it meets these God's
[1:42] design and God's purpose meets the human
[1:44] need and fulfills also in meeting our
[1:47] human need, it fulfills God's purpose
[1:49] and will. And so we're using that uh
[1:51] these elements Christ, church, and a
[1:53] Christian. Why? Because Christ is the
[1:55] foundation of the Christian community.
[1:59] We are not a Christian community because
[2:00] we're made up of Christians, but rather
[2:02] we're a Christian community because we
[2:04] are founded upon the same foundation. We
[2:07] are a part of his body. We are his
[2:09] church as he refers to it. That
[2:10] scriptural word for community is
[2:11] fellowship. And if we are a part of that
[2:15] community by one spirit, you're baptized
[2:16] into that body of Christ. The purpose of
[2:19] his church or his community is to bring
[2:21] us all as individuals into the unity of
[2:24] the faith in the knowledge of the son of
[2:26] God. And if we look at Christ, the
[2:29] church, his church, and a Christian,
[2:31] those things are unified together in
[2:33] that image of a Christian community. And
[2:36] then we have what the Bible refers to as
[2:38] a church or the church or these local
[2:40] churches as we looked at a number of
[2:42] different ones in the scripture on
[2:43] Sunday. But that local church exists
[2:46] because of the church
[2:48] &gt;&gt; and it aids in the uh equipping and the
[2:51] and building of the individual.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. individuals belonging to families,
[2:55] having responsibility in families. So,
[2:56] it continues and extends to that. But
[2:59] the local church isn't focused on
[3:01] growing themselves, isn't focused on
[3:04] becoming this behemoth and this mighty
[3:06] machine. And we say when you stand on
[3:08] your feet and you be an invincible army,
[3:09] no, that that applies to the body of
[3:11] Christ.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; But then the local church then has this
[3:15] uh vision that well then we're
[3:16] supporting that invincible army,
[3:18] &gt;&gt; which is made up of individuals who
[3:20] received the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[3:21] Our goal is to equip and to support the
[3:24] growing of individuals into the measure
[3:26] of Jesus Christ. Not that we could
[3:28] somehow as a local church become the
[3:30] fulfillment of that. But we recognize
[3:32] that those who are here part of this
[3:34] body of Christ who are connected around
[3:36] the world with other believers, you are
[3:39] to grow into that image. And I'm drawing
[3:41] heavily from Acts chapter 2 and taking a
[3:44] lot from the book of Acts because I do
[3:46] believe that the the acts of the
[3:48] apostles were the acts of the Holy
[3:50] Spirit in the apostles and whatever they
[3:53] did then uh the same works will do also.
[3:55] And so there's this pattern of that
[3:57] first church uh is the image of even
[3:59] this last church. So we believe in
[4:01] salvation. We believe in divine healing.
[4:03] We believe in signs and wonders. There
[4:05] was no cessation of laying hands on the
[4:07] sick. There was no ceasing of the gifts.
[4:09] We believe in all those things because
[4:11] that's what the Holy Spirit can do
[4:13] through individuals. It says here in
[4:15] verse 41, we'll read through this again
[4:17] and we want to really focus on uh
[4:19] something in particular here. Again,
[4:21] we're identifying God's uh definition,
[4:24] what it takes to be part of his program
[4:27] or his his purpose. Then they that
[4:29] gladly received his word. That that's
[4:32] one of the most outstanding things here.
[4:33] They received the word of God. The word
[4:35] is preached by Peter. They were baptized
[4:37] uh according to Christian baptism in the
[4:39] name of Jesus Christ. And the same day
[4:40] were added unto them about 3,000 souls.
[4:42] The Bible says God adds to his church,
[4:45] not man. And they now it begins to
[4:47] describe something that I would say this
[4:49] isn't just the 24-hour period, but it's
[4:51] kind of this characteristic of this body
[4:53] that was being formed. They continued
[4:55] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[4:59] fellowship.
[5:01] The Greek word there fellowship is
[5:03] speaks of community or this group this
[5:05] commonness and in breaking of bread and
[5:08] in prayers and fear came upon every soul
[5:11] and many wonders and signs were done by
[5:13] the apostles and all that believed were
[5:16] together. I think that phrase is uh
[5:19] important. All that were believed were
[5:21] together. There was this togetherness
[5:23] and had all things common. And as we
[5:25] read that we think this is uh this is a
[5:28] beautiful image in the scripture. But
[5:29] then verse 45 kind of just arrest all of
[5:32] us or kind of a cost us because uh if uh
[5:35] if you know if this tree ever puts forth
[5:37] another branch
[5:38] &gt;&gt; right they'll write another book of acts
[5:41] &gt;&gt; so get your deeds ready
[5:44] you know don't put it up on eBay and
[5:46] keep all that money now you got to sell
[5:48] everything you have right it says here
[5:49] in verse 45 and sold their possessions
[5:51] and goods and parted them to all men as
[5:53] every man had need. This is uh quite a
[5:58] statement. And it's something I don't
[5:59] know if much of you have many of you
[6:00] have thought about it or even considered
[6:02] what it says here and what that
[6:04] commandment would be and what it looks
[6:05] like today, but it says they had all
[6:07] things common. This word means ordinary
[6:09] or belonging to all. So they kind of
[6:12] owned or used all things jointly, shared
[6:14] by all or shared by many is the idea
[6:17] that is being expressed. They had all
[6:18] things common and in doing so they sold
[6:22] as verse 45 says they sold as much as
[6:24] was necessary to have the means of
[6:28] providing for the needs of everyone.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[6:30] &gt;&gt; So if there was as they all they were
[6:32] all together and had all things common
[6:35] as there was a need that could not be
[6:36] met they they sold those needs and they
[6:38] gave of themselves so that everyone's
[6:40] needs were met. And it is it is good to
[6:43] look at this in within context because
[6:46] these are Jews that are receiving the
[6:47] word of God and these are the church at
[6:49] Jerusalem and there was a prophecy that
[6:51] Jesus gave that this city's going to be
[6:54] besieged, this city's going to be
[6:55] destroyed and you're going to be
[6:56] dispossessed. A and so there was a
[6:59] certain urgency about uh that time and
[7:02] the circumstances and there was maybe
[7:04] less of a need to hold a really good
[7:06] plot downtown and have a nice uh condo
[7:08] in the downtown district. They knew
[7:10] eventually there's, you know, they were
[7:11] going to be chased out of that city. And
[7:13] so there is some very specific context
[7:15] to what they might have been reacting
[7:17] to, but they sold what they had, their
[7:20] possessions, and they got money from
[7:21] that and different uh means of exchange
[7:24] so that they could provide for those who
[7:26] didn't have.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[7:28] &gt;&gt; So that's what it means. They had all
[7:29] things common. But there's a meaning to
[7:32] this word common. And it kind of just
[7:33] really started to click for me because
[7:35] the the word and I'm wanting to maybe
[7:37] give a little bit of a twist on it
[7:38] later, but this word common is actually
[7:40] translated to unclean, undefiled or
[7:43] unholy. So they had all things unholy.
[7:46] And some of us are like, "Yes, yes." You
[7:50] know that thing you said we can't have,
[7:52] Dad? Right? There's these they had all
[7:54] these things common. But what it means
[7:55] that all things common meant they
[7:58] regarded all things as ordinary. In
[8:01] other words, of things common or things
[8:03] profane or things natural that they
[8:05] regarded them as these are just they're
[8:07] not that important
[8:09] &gt;&gt; that if there's a need within the body
[8:11] if there's a need if there's something
[8:13] there that's worth giving up. This is
[8:15] what Jesus means that you should be
[8:16] willing to forsake lands for the sake of
[8:18] the gospel
[8:20] &gt;&gt; that there was this this attitude
[8:21] towards all the things common to them
[8:24] that well if if I've got to give that up
[8:26] for the sake of the gospel that that's
[8:28] an easy question. I remember that a dear
[8:31] friend of mine about the time I had
[8:32] graduated from graduate school and I had
[8:34] received um some nice pens as gifts and
[8:37] two Mont Blancs and so I was
[8:39] fellowshipping with this pastor and he
[8:40] said he said brother Aaron if if if you
[8:43] had two of uh two motorcycles and and I
[8:47] didn't have any would you and he went
[8:48] through this whole scenario he says what
[8:49] about two pens you know if I if you had
[8:52] two Mont Blancs and your brother didn't
[8:53] have one would you be willing to give
[8:54] that up and he said I was like well hold
[8:56] on now you know I've got two Mont Blancs
[8:58] and so there is this idea of sharing you
[9:01] have something well what does it matter
[9:03] to you
[9:04] &gt;&gt; that's their attitude they had this
[9:05] attitude where it was common is to be
[9:07] willing to part with it as it was
[9:09] needful to supply for the needs of
[9:11] others
[9:12] &gt;&gt; so it wasn't just like well I'm a
[9:14] Christian I'm going to sell everything
[9:15] and now I've got all this all this uh
[9:17] money from selling all my bitcoin now
[9:18] what do I do with this it was they
[9:20] regarded as if there's a need these
[9:23] common things don't matter as much as
[9:25] meeting this need
[9:26] &gt;&gt; and that that's what is being emphas
[9:29] emphasized here and you'll see that it
[9:30] unfolds in chapter 4:es 32-37.
[9:35] I believe it's it's good for us as
[9:37] Christians, as believers to look into
[9:39] the scripture and study it and gain
[9:40] wisdom from the scriptures.
[9:42] Specifically, um this kind of it's a
[9:45] scriptural survey, but I believe the
[9:47] teaching is good for us on these things.
[9:49] Says, "And the multitude of them that
[9:50] believed were of one heart and of one
[9:52] soul." Notice kind of these
[9:53] characteristics about the church.
[9:55] Neither said any of them that ought of
[9:57] the things which he possessed was his
[9:59] own, but they had all things common. So
[10:01] now in the mouths of two or three
[10:03] witnesses, let everything be
[10:04] established. Acts chapter 2 wasn't just
[10:07] the church feeling really good on that
[10:09] day and just doing one thing. And but
[10:11] now you see that this is a
[10:12] characteristic. And again, nobody
[10:15] thought that what he had w was was so
[10:18] important as to keep it uh and hoard it
[10:21] for themselves, but as it was necessary,
[10:23] it was it was just ordinary to them.
[10:26] Look at it in this sense, as we
[10:27] mentioned on Sunday, that Christ was
[10:29] what they had in common. And we'll maybe
[10:31] be coming to this later. Paul counted
[10:34] everything else as worthless
[10:37] &gt;&gt; for the gospel's sake.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; And for them, they're holding the
[10:40] fulfillment of all these things. and
[10:42] they're saying this is so precious that
[10:44] this is what matters the most and
[10:46] everything else pales in comparison to
[10:48] that. So if we have if we have this
[10:51] glorious revelation that's dawned upon
[10:52] our souls and then there's this need or
[10:55] some burden or circumstance but that
[10:56] would hinder somebody in participating
[10:58] in the gospel or the full benefits of
[11:00] the atonement. Uh if I can help let me
[11:03] know if I can help
[11:05] and with great power gave the apostles
[11:06] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[11:08] Jesus and great grace was upon them all.
[11:11] And again, it this is kind of amplifies
[11:13] what we read in verse 32. Neither was
[11:15] there any among them that lacked. For as
[11:18] many as were possessors of lands or
[11:20] houses, sold them, and brought the price
[11:23] of the things that were sold, and laid
[11:25] them down at the apostles feet, and
[11:27] distribution was made unto every man
[11:29] according as he had need.
[11:33] The uh I'm trusting everyone's familiar
[11:35] here with these scriptures. Very
[11:37] specific, you know, portray this. A lot
[11:39] of times we say, well, in the book of
[11:40] Acts, you know, you know, the the
[11:42] serpents were shaken off of hands into
[11:44] the fire and the sick were healed and
[11:46] the dead were raised and they spoke with
[11:48] tongues and they were slain in the
[11:49] spirit. And there's a lot of things we
[11:51] really like to think about in the book
[11:52] of Acts, but this is written right
[11:54] alongside it.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe we could argue that if this isn't
[11:57] happening in your church, it's because
[11:59] you haven't sold all your land.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; You haven't sold all your houses.
[12:05] There was a an attitude towards natural
[12:08] things and natural possessions. It
[12:10] didn't have this preeminence. And so
[12:11] those that had lands or houses sold them
[12:14] as was necessary to distribute to those
[12:17] that had need. And it says, "And Moses,
[12:20] who by apostles were surname Barnabas,
[12:22] which is being interpreted the son of
[12:24] consolation, a Levite and of the country
[12:26] of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and
[12:30] brought the money and laid it at the
[12:32] apostles feet." And so one guy gets
[12:33] called out. This is what he did. He was
[12:36] a he was a of a certain country and a
[12:38] Levite and he had land. He sold it,
[12:40] brought the money, laid it at the
[12:41] apostles feet. It wasn't just one person
[12:44] that did it, but those who had things
[12:46] maybe that the common man didn't have.
[12:49] They didn't just have a plot of land,
[12:50] but they had lands. They had houses. Uh
[12:53] there was a there was this reordering of
[12:56] priorities,
[12:57] &gt;&gt; right? It's like I'm not here just to uh
[13:00] with a rich dad poor dad mentality and I
[13:03] just want to accumulate wealth so I can
[13:04] pass it down to my sons. There was this
[13:07] attitude towards these things. It says
[13:09] look the most important thing is the
[13:10] gospel. The most important thing is
[13:12] being faithful over those things that
[13:13] God had given me. And to the extent that
[13:15] I'm able to bless those that are more
[13:17] unfortunate and support this great cause
[13:19] of getting the gospel out. I I I don't
[13:22] need to be so concerned about
[13:23] investments in natural things. I want to
[13:25] invest in things that are eternal.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; And what I could I could say if we were
[13:31] to just distill this down and maybe
[13:33] separate it from these individual acts
[13:35] of selling land and houses and the
[13:36] collection of money, it does identify
[13:39] some sense of community that was united
[13:42] around something and a responsibility
[13:44] that that they felt towards one another
[13:47] within that.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Right? It wasn't let's sell everything
[13:50] we have and identify a charity that we
[13:52] could give it to for tax purposes, but
[13:53] rather it was like we have these needs
[13:55] within ourselves and among ourselves and
[13:58] we we look at everything we have as
[14:00] potentially being used for the benefit
[14:02] of somebody else and for the furtherance
[14:04] of the gospel. So there was this sense
[14:06] of being together, this united uh uh
[14:09] this group that's united together
[14:12] and this responsibility they had to one
[14:14] another. And so this act of selling uh
[14:18] their possessions and gaining uh income
[14:20] from that and selling assets or whatever
[14:22] it might be and then distributing it
[14:24] didn't create this precedent
[14:27] of having a commune. Does that name
[14:30] sound familiar to was anybody part of a
[14:32] hippie commune in here? I've got
[14:34] stories.
[14:36] My dad tells stories. There there was a
[14:39] time when kind of this idea of being
[14:40] communal and everyone being together.
[14:42] It's this sense of a commune. And that's
[14:44] what some people draw from this
[14:45] scripture. They had all things common.
[14:47] So it's like sell everything you have.
[14:49] Pull the money together and we'll all
[14:50] live in one place as one community. All
[14:52] possessions are shared. You know, I
[14:54] don't own I don't own a a comb. It's we
[14:57] all own this comb. And that's not my
[14:59] milk. That's your milk. We all together
[15:01] share the same toothbrush. Everything
[15:03] else everything is one another's. A
[15:06] commune by definition is a group of
[15:07] people living together and sharing
[15:09] possessions and responsibilities.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; The idea of a commune is we live
[15:13] together. We have no individual
[15:15] possessions. It's all for the use and
[15:16] benefit of everyone. So, some read these
[15:18] scriptures and interpret it. And there's
[15:20] been some Christian communities that
[15:21] have tried to create a commune. Everyone
[15:24] dresses the same. There's no private
[15:26] ownership, everything. Or it's all owned
[15:29] by the pastor or the cult leader. It's
[15:32] all run by a a group of men. Uh because
[15:34] this is the way that the scriptures did
[15:36] it. But you do not find Paul or any of
[15:38] the other apostles for that matter
[15:40] exhorting the Christian or even the
[15:42] Christian churches to sell all their
[15:44] possessions and live together and share
[15:46] all their possessions. These are very
[15:48] specific things that happen early on in
[15:50] the book of Acts amongst these Jews at
[15:52] Jerusalem. And they're selling their
[15:54] possessions. They're providing for the
[15:56] needs of others. And it doesn't mean
[15:58] that today what we need to do, and this
[16:00] may be come as a relief to some of you
[16:02] if you're wondering where I'm going,
[16:04] that we need to sell houses and lands
[16:06] and possessions. And if you had two
[16:08] Xboxes, you know, wouldn't you sell one
[16:10] and and put the rest into the offering?
[16:12] And if you had two cars, aren't you good
[16:14] enough with one? And it's not that. It's
[16:17] this uh it was something that's being
[16:20] identified about a sense of community
[16:21] and a responsibility to it. Yeah.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; The precedent or the example that is set
[16:27] is that there is this necessity of being
[16:30] a part of something and the
[16:32] responsibility you have as being a part
[16:34] of it. Let's survey a number of
[16:36] scriptures then that as if we could I
[16:39] would read all the other scriptures that
[16:40] I could find where Paul is saying sell
[16:42] what you have and distribute it amongst
[16:44] everyone equally. It actually doesn't
[16:47] say that. It says they sold what they
[16:48] had and gave it to people who had need.
[16:50] And maybe there's some kind of leveling
[16:51] up where everyone then finds the same
[16:53] stasis, but rather it's just speaking to
[16:56] these events in Acts chapter 2 and Acts
[16:58] chapter 4, and there's other places
[16:59] we'll read some other time where they're
[17:02] specifically
[17:03] selling things and giving things. But
[17:05] what we can draw from that in the later
[17:07] books of the Bible is that there was
[17:09] this need uh uh there was a
[17:11] responsibility that people had to each
[17:13] other. That's
[17:14] &gt;&gt; right. in Galatians chapter 2:10. And I
[17:17] know I'm just grabbing the the the the
[17:20] principle out of the the middle of
[17:21] larger teaching, but just in the book of
[17:23] Galatians, there's four scriptures we
[17:24] could read. Only they would that we
[17:27] should remember the poor, the same which
[17:30] I also was for to do. It says we should
[17:33] remember the poor, the less fortunate,
[17:35] those that do not have what we have. We
[17:37] should remember the poor.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; This is akin to the attitude that they
[17:41] had early on the church. all were
[17:43] together and all that believed and and
[17:45] they saw needs and they distributed.
[17:47] They took what they had and we realized
[17:48] that assets and income and money are
[17:50] different today. So you may not need to
[17:52] sell a house to give to the needy. You
[17:54] may have resources or income that you
[17:57] can use. And so it says that we should
[17:59] remember the poor. And I believe that as
[18:00] Christians we ought to remember the
[18:02] poor. And it's not just the the common
[18:05] poor, but even though especially those
[18:08] amongst them in chapter 5:13, for
[18:12] brethren, you have been called unto
[18:13] liberty only use not liberty for an
[18:15] occasion to the flesh, but by love serve
[18:19] one another. Right.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; So, as you've been given liberty, as we
[18:22] have liberty, whether it be to exercise
[18:24] your rights within a capitalist economy
[18:26] or to pursue certain priv uh privileges,
[18:29] we don't use that liberty for ourselves,
[18:31] but we by love serve one another.
[18:35] Remember the poor, serve one another.
[18:36] Chapter 6:2, bear ye one another's
[18:38] burdens, and so fulfill the law of
[18:41] Christ.
[18:42] So there is a laden. There is a
[18:44] burdening of others that when you see
[18:47] that you want to assist or aid to the
[18:49] extent that you're able.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; That doesn't that doesn't contradict
[18:53] with when he says bear we must bear our
[18:55] own burden. Every man in this chapter he
[18:57] says must bear their own burdens. But
[18:59] that burden is that which you are tasked
[19:02] with carrying.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; This burden here is that which brings
[19:05] somebody down. And so we have a
[19:08] responsibility that if we are carrying
[19:09] that burden that we are tasked with
[19:11] carrying, then there's a blessing that
[19:13] comes with it. God is providing all your
[19:15] needs. All our sufficiency is in Christ.
[19:17] Then is there someone that has a need,
[19:18] we have this responsibility to bear
[19:21] their burdens. He says, "And fulfill the
[19:23] law of Christ."
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Remember this great principle of love
[19:26] thy neighbor as thyself. Verse 10. And
[19:28] as we there have therefore opportunity,
[19:31] let us do good unto all men.
[19:34] Someone please do a search for me. I
[19:36] want to know if all men includes
[19:37] liberals. Does it include Democrats?
[19:40] Truly, there's no real men in the
[19:42] Democratic party. So maybe we're safe
[19:45] there. But it says, "Do good unto all
[19:47] men." Was it not that that lawyer's
[19:50] question? Well, who who is my neighbor?
[19:52] Right? Love thy neighbor as thyself.
[19:53] Well, I'm going to determine who my
[19:55] neighbor is,
[19:57] and I don't have any neighbors, right?
[19:59] That's the that's the way that we could
[20:00] describe it. or my neighbor is the one
[20:02] that dresses this way, acts this way,
[20:04] believes this way, and is this way, and
[20:06] has the same last name as me, and gives
[20:08] money to me, and takes care of me.
[20:09] That's my neighbor. But it says, do good
[20:12] unto all men. And if you struggle with
[20:15] that, should we do evil to anyone? No,
[20:18] &gt;&gt; shouldn't. He says, "Do good unto all
[20:19] men, especially," now this narrows down
[20:22] whom to whom we have this direct
[20:23] responsibility to, especially unto them
[20:25] who are of the household of faith,
[20:28] &gt;&gt; this family of God, this community, even
[20:30] this uh this body that would be
[20:32] gathering locally where these believers
[20:34] are coming out of the world, Gentiles
[20:36] coming, Jews coming from all these
[20:38] different walks of life, they're
[20:39] accepting the gospel. There'd be this
[20:40] responsibility to each other and they
[20:42] would identify some a sense of
[20:45] commonality, communion amongst
[20:46] themselves. He says we ought to do good
[20:49] especially to the household of the
[20:50] saints. Romans 12:13 as he goes through
[20:53] these different characteristics he says
[20:54] distributing to the necessity of saints
[20:56] given to hospitality.
[20:58] There should be a distributing to those
[21:00] needs. We share in the needs of
[21:03] believers. We share in the needs of
[21:05] those of our own church. Our own
[21:07] families
[21:09] should be given to hospitality.
[21:13] 1 Timothy chapter 6 18 that they do
[21:15] good. This is what we ought to be
[21:17] teaching. That they do good. This is
[21:18] something we ought to expect of those in
[21:21] offices. That they do good. This is what
[21:23] we're teaching young men. This is what
[21:24] we teach young women to do good. That
[21:26] they be rich in good works. Ready to
[21:28] distribute. Willing to communicate.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; There should be a willingness to
[21:35] communicate.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; To distribute.
[21:38] That means ready to give.
[21:41] So could you see where these principles
[21:43] that are being expressed in Galatians
[21:45] and Romans and now in Timothy that when
[21:47] it said that all things they had all
[21:49] things common and so they sold their
[21:51] possessions and distributed them as
[21:53] others had need. It was because they
[21:55] were ready to distribute. It's not
[21:59] compulsory now. It's just saying you
[22:01] should be ready to as there is have need
[22:02] bear one another's burden serve one
[22:04] another in love distribute to the
[22:06] necessity of the saints. And it says
[22:08] willing to communicate. Ready and able
[22:10] to maintain. That word communicate means
[22:12] community and fellowship.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Ready and willing to maintain that.
[22:17] In Acts 20:35,
[22:20] I showed you I have showed you all
[22:22] things how that so laboring you ought to
[22:24] support the weak.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[22:29] And remember the words of the Lord Jesus
[22:32] how he said, "It is more blessed to give
[22:34] than to receive." I I love this one
[22:36] because now go try to find that in the
[22:38] Gospels and you say, "Well, he's just
[22:41] making this up."
[22:43] But he says, "You ought to support the
[22:45] weak and remember the words of the Lord
[22:46] Jesus." How he said it is more. And we
[22:48] believe this. We believe this to be the
[22:49] scripture. I think theological schools
[22:51] might say, "Well, we don't have any
[22:53] reason to believe that Jesus actually
[22:54] said this." So, we kind of cut that out.
[22:57] Maybe it's because they want to keep
[22:58] receiving and not giving. But says it's
[23:01] more blessed to give than to receive.
[23:03] Why does he say this in uh in in uh
[23:05] support of supporting the weak,
[23:08] &gt;&gt; distributing uh those things that are
[23:11] necessary to the necessity of the
[23:13] saints, bearing one another's burdens,
[23:15] you ought to support the weak.
[23:18] And again, this responsibility is first
[23:21] to your own house, the household of
[23:23] faith. It's not identifying some third
[23:26] parties. It doesn't mean we have
[23:27] responsibility to make sure all the
[23:29] homeless in downtown Phoenix have a
[23:30] place to stay. uh that's a kind of a a
[23:33] changing uh uh and this this outward uh
[23:37] uh kind of expression of these
[23:38] principles where it's just in charity
[23:40] alone. It's not that there's something
[23:41] that draws you together, something
[23:43] motivating you, some vision and goal
[23:45] that you have. It's not just to clothe
[23:47] those who don't have clothes. It's not
[23:48] just to house those that don't have
[23:49] housing. It's for the sake of the
[23:50] gospel.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[23:54] &gt;&gt; In Acts 20:35 is we just read you ought
[23:57] to support the weak. This is again in
[23:59] this context of this axe church. It's
[24:02] more blessed to give than to receive. In
[24:04] Hebrews chapter 13:16, but to do good
[24:07] and to communicate, forget not. We could
[24:10] say it this way. Do not forget to do
[24:13] good. All right, I got that. And do not
[24:16] forget to communicate. And this may make
[24:19] some of us nervous, the introverts
[24:21] nervous, those who have a hard time
[24:23] communicating. But the word actually
[24:24] says do not do not forget to fellowship
[24:26] or have community.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; This is communication as we we're we're
[24:31] tracking this for future services. This
[24:33] uh this this idea and this concept of
[24:35] communication and how important it is to
[24:36] relationships and community. But we
[24:38] ought to forget not to communicate or to
[24:40] fellowship.
[24:43] For with such sacrifices, God is well
[24:45] pleased. The sacrifice of doing good.
[24:48] Why would doing good be a sacrifice?
[24:51] Because you're distributing to
[24:52] necessities,
[24:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[24:53] &gt;&gt; You're bearing one another's burdens.
[24:54] You're using where you might have excess
[24:57] or you might have abundance and you're
[24:58] distributing that. Where you have time
[25:00] to give, you give time. Where you have
[25:02] certain uh wisdom to give, you give of
[25:04] it. Where you have certain resources,
[25:05] you share that. This is the idea to do
[25:07] good and to fellowship, to have
[25:09] community. This sacrifice, God is
[25:11] pleased with this. And he says, don't
[25:13] forget to do it.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; It's described this way in 1 Corinthians
[25:17] chapter 16:es 1 and two. And we know
[25:20] that we're kind of it feels as if we're
[25:22] kind of peeking into something that we
[25:24] don't know fully. He says, "Now,
[25:26] concerning the collection for the
[25:27] saints, we're going to be taking up a
[25:29] love offering. We're taking up a
[25:31] missions offering. We're we're taking up
[25:32] a special offering for certain needs."
[25:34] He says, "Now concerning this giving of
[25:36] all yourselves for these needs of
[25:38] believers elsewhere, I've given order to
[25:40] the churches of Galatia. Even so do ye.
[25:44] As I have asked the churches in Galatia
[25:46] to take uh uh to gather funds and to
[25:49] gather certain resources for the
[25:52] distribution to saints, I want you to do
[25:54] in Corinth as well. So he says, upon the
[25:56] first day of the week, let every one of
[25:58] you lay by him in store as God hath
[26:00] prospered him, that there be no
[26:02] gatherings when I come. In other words,
[26:04] collect now as God has blessed you, and
[26:06] then when I come, I can take that and
[26:09] distribute it to those who have need of
[26:10] it. Again, there's this principle in
[26:13] scripture. I know that when we taught on
[26:15] total worship in the the principles of
[26:17] Christian giving that we could see in
[26:19] the scriptures that over and over again
[26:20] there's this idea of how we have a
[26:22] responsibility as believers to give not
[26:26] just tithes but also offerings for the
[26:29] needs of the church and then also for
[26:31] the needs of others beyond ourselves.
[26:33] Right.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; This is I'm I'm reading these things to
[26:37] show you that there was a sense of
[26:39] community within Christian churches and
[26:42] a responsibility that Christians had to
[26:44] that church,
[26:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Not to determine who's in it and who's
[26:48] out of it, but this responsibility that
[26:50] one felt to this community.
[26:54] We we're and not to if I I just feel
[26:58] maybe need to clarify myself. We're
[27:00] building off of chapter two and chapter
[27:03] four, how they had all things common and
[27:06] they sold lands and possessions and what
[27:08] they collected they distributed as
[27:10] people had need. We see this teaching
[27:12] carried over not in the command to sell
[27:14] everything but in the command to give as
[27:16] you are able.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Right? In acts 11 19 to30 I just read
[27:21] through this I think the beginning
[27:23] verses here up to verse 26 or so uh
[27:27] verse 27 describes the Christian
[27:30] community this growing as I have it
[27:31] identified here this growing community
[27:33] of believers and Christians. Now they
[27:35] which were scattered abroad upon the pu
[27:37] persecution that arose about Steven
[27:39] traveled as far as Phoen Cyprus and
[27:41] Antioch preaching the word to none but
[27:44] unto the Jews only. So now they're being
[27:47] scattered because of the persecution. We
[27:48] read some of that on Sunday. And some of
[27:50] them were men of Cyprus and Sirene,
[27:52] which when they were come to Antioch,
[27:54] spake unto the Grecians preaching the
[27:56] Lord Jesus. And the Lord was with him.
[27:59] And a great number believed and turned
[28:01] unto the Lord. Then tidings of these
[28:04] things came unto the ears of the church
[28:06] which was in Jerusalem. So now you have
[28:07] believers in Finis and Cyprus and
[28:09] Antioch. Now Grecians are receiving
[28:12] Jesus Christ in Antioch. Then tidings
[28:15] came to uh the church in Jerusalem, and
[28:18] they sent forth Bonafice that he should
[28:20] go as far as Antioch, who when he came
[28:22] and had seen the grace of God, was glad
[28:24] and exhorted them all, that with purpose
[28:27] of heart they should cleave unto the
[28:28] Lord, for he was a good man and full of
[28:30] the Holy Ghost, and of faith, and as
[28:32] much people were added unto the Lord.
[28:34] Then departed Barnabas to Sarsus, for to
[28:37] seek Saul. And when he had found him, he
[28:39] brought him unto Antioch. And it came to
[28:40] pass that a whole year they assembled
[28:43] themselves with the church and taught
[28:44] much people. And the disciples were
[28:47] called Christians first in Antioch. This
[28:50] is the dynamics of God raising up
[28:53] believers. They heard the gospel. They
[28:54] believed. They're baptized. The Holy
[28:56] Ghost falls out upon them. Now they're
[28:57] being taught. They're being instructed.
[28:59] They're being established in the gospel.
[29:01] And as they begin to live their life
[29:03] within the community of Antioch, this
[29:05] community, this body is identified as
[29:07] being Christians.
[29:09] And in these days came prophets from
[29:10] Jerusalem unto Antioch. So now we see
[29:13] these ministries working within the
[29:15] body. They come from Antioch. And there
[29:16] stood up one of them named Agabus and
[29:19] signified by the spirit that there
[29:20] should be great dur throughout all the
[29:22] world. So now one is prophesying there's
[29:23] going to be a famine. It says which came
[29:25] to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
[29:28] This is the response now to this
[29:31] oncoming famine.
[29:33] We might say, "Well, I'm going to I want
[29:35] to buy all the toilet paper for myself,
[29:37] and I want to buy all the MREs, and I
[29:39] want to get all I want to have my
[29:41] basement stocked full of all the things
[29:43] I need for myself." But it says, "Then
[29:45] the disciples, every man according to
[29:47] his ability, determined to send relief
[29:51] under the brethren which dwelt in
[29:52] Judea."
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of the famine.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Because maybe they weren't impacted as
[29:58] much as the others, and they had these
[30:00] means. They determined as they were able
[30:02] what was within their ability. They
[30:04] weren't it wasn't compulsory.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Well, you you you shouldn't be living in
[30:08] a 3,000 foot house. You can downsize and
[30:10] go move in with them and take your money
[30:12] and give it to those in Judea. No, as
[30:14] each one was able according to his
[30:15] ability, they determined in their hearts
[30:17] voluntarily and willingly to send relief
[30:19] unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea,
[30:21] which also they did, and sent it to the
[30:23] elders by the hands of Barnabas and
[30:25] Saul. What we read here is this response
[30:28] of, and I know I'm using, maybe it just
[30:30] seems to be a buzzword, community, but
[30:32] the Christians, this body of Christ,
[30:36] this sense of belonging together, this
[30:38] united cause. And when they saw a need
[30:40] somewhere else, they supported it.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[30:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what this church has
[30:43] tried to do. And they're giving for
[30:44] certain causes through the years. And
[30:46] how when there's war in Ukraine, there
[30:48] was believers who've given and there's
[30:50] been individuals and churches and
[30:51] families that have been supported
[30:52] through that giving. It's the same thing
[30:54] here that as there was a need there
[30:56] &gt;&gt; and you realize they don't have money
[30:58] for oil, they don't have money for for
[31:00] these certain things in bread. And as we
[31:02] had within our own ability, we give
[31:08] in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 5-10.
[31:12] Therefore, I thought it necessary to
[31:14] exhort the brethren that they should go
[31:15] before unto you, and make up beforehand
[31:18] your bounty, wherefore you had noticed
[31:21] before that the same might be ready as a
[31:23] mantra of b as a matter of bounty and
[31:25] not as as of covetousness. I just kind
[31:27] of uh fun language there, the bounty.
[31:31] And here he's saying you you made up
[31:33] your offering there. There's been a
[31:35] collection of of things and we could say
[31:39] according to their ability as one had
[31:40] had need to give. you you've made up
[31:42] your offering, your gift beforehand. So,
[31:44] but this I say, he which seweth
[31:46] sparingly shall al shall reap also
[31:48] sparingly, and he which seweth
[31:50] bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
[31:53] So, there is in this another sense of a
[31:56] collection for the saints. So, this
[31:57] gathering together is there is needs and
[31:59] making up this giving this collection
[32:02] saying those that give a lot will be
[32:04] blessed a lot and those that give little
[32:05] will be blessed a little. Every man
[32:07] according as he, notice this, as he
[32:09] purposeth in his heart, so let him give.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; This isn't being uh forced.
[32:18] The monitor is taking exception to this.
[32:21] Think of it in this way. As we've
[32:22] mentioned before, in the Old Testament,
[32:24] they had compulsory giving,
[32:27] &gt;&gt; which God said if you don't give, you're
[32:30] cut off. Yeah.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; As we go through the blood and we go
[32:33] through the cross, we come to the New
[32:34] Testament, there being grace and not
[32:35] this law. We see in grace, it says give
[32:38] and you'll be blessed.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; So, as there was something punitive for
[32:42] not giving the Old Testament, there's a
[32:43] blessing that comes when you give in the
[32:44] New Testament because you do it, you're
[32:46] not compel compelled to do it by law,
[32:49] but you're compelled to do it by love.
[32:51] Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; So he says, "As you are able, purpose in
[32:53] your heart to give, not grudgingly or of
[32:55] necessity because you have to, for God
[32:58] loveth a cheerful giver."
[33:03] &gt;&gt; I can't remember which writer was it
[33:04] Spurgeon, one of these great writers
[33:06] said, "Cheerful holiness is the most
[33:08] forcable of sermons."
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when one is cheerful, when
[33:12] one is happy, when one is free, when one
[33:14] recognizes who they are and their
[33:16] position in Christ, a and they still
[33:18] live a life of godliness and holiness
[33:20] and they're still giving, that is that
[33:22] is a great witness.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; But if we all give because we have to
[33:26] and well, I guess I have to do this and
[33:28] I have to do that. No, God loves a
[33:30] cheerful giver. And God is able to make
[33:32] all grace abound toward you that ye
[33:34] always having all sufficiency. And then
[33:37] notice this phrase again, all things
[33:40] may abound to every good work. And then
[33:43] he begins to quote, as it is written, he
[33:44] hath dispersed abroad. He hath given to
[33:46] the poor. His righteousness remainth
[33:48] forever. This is what God does. He
[33:49] giveth to the poor. Now he that minister
[33:51] seed to the sewer both minister bread
[33:53] for your food and multiply your seed
[33:55] sown and increase the fruits of your
[33:58] righteousness.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a
[34:03] perverting of this of these principles I
[34:05] think within modern Christianity where
[34:07] you want to sew a seed what is it to
[34:09] this ministry and God will bless you.
[34:11] You know you you you sew to this
[34:12] ministry and God will give you a bigger
[34:14] house. You sew to this and God and there
[34:16] and there certainly is a manipulation
[34:18] and perverting of this. But don't let
[34:20] the scarecrows
[34:22] uh turn you into one who doesn't want to
[34:24] give and one who doesn't think you
[34:26] should give and I'm just going to look
[34:27] out for myself. There is a principle
[34:30] that we being a part of something beyond
[34:32] ourselves want to serve beyond
[34:34] ourselves.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; And God says,"I will provide those
[34:39] things that you have need of having all
[34:41] sufficiency in all things. As you give,
[34:44] as you are able, as you purpose in your
[34:45] heart, give not grudgingly, not of
[34:47] necessity, but I'm going to cheerfully
[34:49] give. And I'm going to as I give, it's
[34:51] going to be dispersed to the needs that
[34:53] are h that we have amongst ourselves.
[34:56] And God will bless that. Amen.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; These these are a number of scriptures.
[35:01] We've read some lengthy statements in
[35:03] Acts 11 here in 2 Corinthians 9 and some
[35:06] of these quick hits in Galatians and
[35:07] Timothy in Hebrews. But all these
[35:10] scriptures demonstrate that there is a
[35:13] body of Christ. We could call it a
[35:16] Christian community just to serve our
[35:17] subject matter. And this responsibility
[35:19] that's being taught to those who are a
[35:21] part of it by one spirit. You're
[35:23] baptized into one body. And that as
[35:26] being a part of that body, you have a
[35:27] responsibility to the household of
[35:29] faith. You ought to support the weak. Be
[35:31] ready to distribute, willing to
[35:32] communicate, distribute to the necessity
[35:34] of the saints. Do good unto all men,
[35:36] especially those of the household of
[35:37] faith. Bear ye one another's burdens by
[35:39] love. Serve one another concerning the
[35:41] collection for the saints concerning the
[35:42] distribution as you are able to those in
[35:45] Judea and and giving of this making up
[35:47] of a bounty to distribute to others who
[35:49] have need. All these things are
[35:50] scriptures and teaching to the New
[35:52] Testament church. And it shows that
[35:54] there was a community and that there was
[35:58] a responsibility to it.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; And this community and responsibility
[36:05] begins from something. I say this and I
[36:08] took time to maybe focus on this aspect
[36:10] because then kind of what we're doing is
[36:11] we're saying this is how the community
[36:12] operates or this is how it operated. But
[36:15] you have to you can't back into
[36:17] community. In other words, we can't say
[36:18] well I tell you what, we just seem to be
[36:20] kind of disjointed and we're not all on
[36:21] the same page. So, why don't we just
[36:23] kind of pull all our money together this
[36:24] year a a and simplify and have a lot of
[36:28] garage sales and pull our resources and
[36:30] get our money real tight. And if you
[36:31] have a car that you're not using, sell
[36:32] it. And if you have a vacation property,
[36:34] sell it. If you have a second home in in
[36:36] in Aspen, Colorado, just deed it to the
[36:38] pastor. All you don't need those things.
[36:40] Let's just put them all into one big
[36:41] trust and let's all get on the same
[36:43] page. It doesn't work that way,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[36:46] &gt;&gt; You you don't you don't create community
[36:48] by forcing everyone to have everything
[36:49] in common. Right.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; That is cultish.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; That is talk about an interesting word
[36:56] study. Communism
[37:00] &gt;&gt; and its association with community
[37:03] &gt;&gt; and all things common and communion.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; So there is a perversion of this that
[37:07] becomes communism.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; It's godless.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; It's not tied to and connected with the
[37:13] heart of God. to this community, the
[37:15] things I'm preaching, and I know I may
[37:16] be using a a a modern buzzword to some,
[37:19] and it might scare some people off. I
[37:20] don't know. But it there is a body of
[37:22] Christ. There is this this supernatural
[37:26] uh union that takes place with the word
[37:29] of all these individuals. So, you are
[37:31] part of something very very real. Then
[37:33] there's literal churches that are then
[37:34] exist as a result of that. But this this
[37:37] feeling of together, this unity that
[37:38] transpires begins with having a common
[37:40] foundation and a common purpose.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; We don't just look at it and say, "Well,
[37:46] we should be sharing our resources. We
[37:48] should be given our money. You should be
[37:49] doing this. We should have all things in
[37:51] common. We should dress the same. We
[37:53] should talk the same." No. There's a
[37:54] human way of producing that. Right.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; And that's what produces hippie communes
[38:00] &gt;&gt; and Jesus people movements a
[38:03] &gt;&gt; and certain sects that put their uh draw
[38:06] their their teachings from the Bible,
[38:09] but they've turned into uh things that
[38:12] lift up traditions of men,
[38:14] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[38:15] &gt;&gt; AND ESPOUSE certain things by legalism.
[38:17] It's got to be this way and you you
[38:18] can't do this and you can't do that and
[38:20] this is wrong and this is wrong. So it
[38:22] creates this fear of anything else
[38:23] outside of that. So you all share out of
[38:27] fear
[38:28] &gt;&gt; and not out of love.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; And that is communism.
[38:35] In Acts chapter 2 verse 44, we've
[38:37] already read this so we could just read
[38:38] it now. It says, "And all that believed
[38:40] were together
[38:41] and had all things in common. Had all
[38:43] things common." What were they? They
[38:45] were believers
[38:47] &gt;&gt; and together first.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; They believed.
[38:51] If you don't believe,
[38:53] that's going to be an interesting
[38:55] dynamic,
[38:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Take somebody that doesn't have faith.
[38:58] Take someone that doesn't really
[38:59] believe, but they just want to be part
[39:01] of community. They they just want to be
[39:03] a part of something. And regard we don't
[39:05] all have to believe the same, but we
[39:06] need each other. Right? All we need is
[39:09] love.
[39:11] There you go. Right. And said, "Well,
[39:12] that's all we need to do. Let's just all
[39:14] get on the same page." Right. Michael,
[39:15] row your boat to shore. kumbaya and
[39:18] let's just kind of just we're together
[39:19] because we need togetherness. Well,
[39:21] THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT going to work.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz after a while, if you're if you're
[39:25] not united in faith, then after a while,
[39:27] it's like, well, I don't think that's
[39:28] right, and he doesn't think that's
[39:30] right. And we have all these different
[39:31] ideas. And then somebody's got a better
[39:33] idea of how we can be together. And what
[39:35] happens? Split.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; And then every so there has to be they
[39:39] believed because they believed that was
[39:41] the most important part. And they were
[39:43] together. That phrase means they had the
[39:45] same kind of per the same purpose.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Notice what it says in Acts 4:32. This
[39:50] is this precursor to everyone selling
[39:52] everything they had or distributing. And
[39:54] the multitude of of them that believed
[39:56] were of one heart and of one soul.
[39:58] I ought to identify that this happened
[40:01] first
[40:02] before the next part happened.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; So then the emphasis isn't on Come on,
[40:07] brother Elazar. Please, please, you have
[40:10] five fishing rods and this brother
[40:12] doesn't have any. At least you could
[40:14] break one in half and GIVE HIM TWO AND A
[40:16] HALF.
[40:18] That's not THEY'RE NOT COMPELLING. IT'S
[40:20] LIKE THERE IS A TOGETHERNESS. THIS IS
[40:22] WHAT YOU want to promote. This unity of
[40:23] faith. The multitude of them that
[40:26] believed were of one heart and of one
[40:28] soul.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; And because of that, there was this
[40:31] product that was produced within
[40:32] themselves and this attitude towards
[40:34] others. Neither said any of them that
[40:36] ought of the thing which he possessed
[40:37] was his own. But they had all things
[40:38] common. They were all willing to forsake
[40:42] &gt;&gt; the common things, the ordinary things,
[40:44] the things that pald in comparison to
[40:46] the grace that they were receiving.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; And we're willing to distribute and
[40:50] willing to give and to support others of
[40:52] like faith who were of one mind and one
[40:54] accord.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; I I can say this. I know God knows human
[41:00] nature.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; He knows how hard it is to forgive.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; And he asked you to forgive.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Thank God he doesn't ask us to forget.
[41:09] That's why I like to say to forgive is
[41:10] human. To forget is divine.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; God forgive for for doesn't even have
[41:15] any knowledge of your sins. They're cast
[41:17] behind his back. You're justified. But
[41:19] he ask us as humans to forgive. And that
[41:22] means he knows that we can the right
[41:24] way.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; There is a right way to do it. Don't
[41:27] just forget about it a and move on. No.
[41:30] Go forward with and a part of that going
[41:32] forward is by forgiveness. And so he's
[41:35] not asking us to give the wrong way. or
[41:38] just to give for the sake of giving.
[41:40] He's going to teach us the secrets. It
[41:42] is believing being rooted and grounded
[41:44] in faith of one heart and one soul.
[41:48] Philippians chapter 2:es 1 to8.
[41:51] If there be therefore any consolation in
[41:54] Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
[41:56] fellowship of the spirit community,
[41:57] that's the togetherness. If any bowels
[42:00] and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you
[42:02] be likeminded, having the same love,
[42:07] being of one accord, of one mind.
[42:11] Is it canes that has the mantra one love
[42:14] chicken tenders?
[42:17] &gt;&gt; I got some yeps and some last but no
[42:19] amen. So we're safe. Don't want to
[42:21] create a Chick-fil-A canes war here.
[42:24] Fulfill ye my joy that you be
[42:25] like-minded, having the same love, being
[42:27] of one accord, of one mind. THIS IS WHAT
[42:28] HE DESIRED FOR THERE TO be is the these
[42:31] things. So how is that going to be uh
[42:33] transpire?
[42:35] There's been some uh meetings I've been
[42:36] asked to minister, some ministers
[42:38] meetings to be a part of. And a lot of
[42:39] times the questions are and some recent
[42:41] ones it's posed is, you know, how do we
[42:42] all get together despite doctrinal
[42:44] differences?
[42:46] And so there's a way that you look at
[42:48] that and you say, "Oh, we want unity."
[42:50] So the goal is unity for all of us to be
[42:53] together and on the same page. Well,
[42:55] that's not what we're trying to do is to
[42:56] create unity. What we want to do is have
[42:59] the same love,
[43:01] &gt;&gt; the same faith,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; have the same heart, the same mind. And
[43:05] what mind is that that we want? He says,
[43:07] "Let nothing be done through strife or
[43:08] vain glory.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; But in loneliness of mind, let each
[43:12] esteem other better than themselves."
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Look not every man on his own things.
[43:18] This would be I've got lands. I've got
[43:19] possessions. I've got all these things.
[43:21] But every man also on the things of
[43:22] others.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO IT says uh let look not every
[43:26] man on his own things. It's not saying
[43:28] that don't look on what you have but you
[43:29] would see what you have in view of what
[43:32] others have and you have a better
[43:34] understanding OF WHAT GOD HAS BLESSED
[43:36] YOU with and the means that you have to
[43:38] provide FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE what
[43:40] you have.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Let every man look at his own things.
[43:44] But not just only on his own things
[43:46] alone, but look upon what he has as
[43:48] something that can be distributed to
[43:50] those who don't have what you have. But
[43:52] every man also looks. So he says we we
[43:54] we recognize what we have, but what do
[43:57] others have? Let's be concerned about
[43:59] the burdens of others.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Every man must bear his own burden, but
[44:02] bear ye one another's burdens. So he
[44:04] says, "Let this mind be in you which was
[44:06] also in Christ Jesus."
[44:09] I think there's maybe uh have you seen
[44:12] those word graphs where um they can
[44:14] create a chart of words that are
[44:15] mentioned the most in a book or a
[44:17] document and they get bigger and bigger
[44:18] as they uh uh and within the context of
[44:21] the chart based upon the number of times
[44:23] that they're mentioned. I wonder just
[44:24] how many times some of these scriptures
[44:26] just keep getting mentioned over and
[44:27] over again. No matter what subject you
[44:28] cross,
[44:30] &gt;&gt; no matter which way you approach it, it
[44:31] ends up passing through one of these
[44:32] verses. So we they're mentioned a lot.
[44:35] There's a lot of repetition, especially
[44:36] this scripture as of late. Let this mind
[44:38] be in you which was also in Christ
[44:39] Jesus. What was that mindset?
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it
[44:43] not robbery to be equal with God, but
[44:45] made himself of no reputation, and took
[44:46] upon him the form of a servant, and was
[44:49] made in the likeness of men, and being
[44:51] found in fashion as a man, he humbled
[44:52] himself, and became obedient unto death,
[44:54] even the death of the cross.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; He was not just in the form of a
[44:58] servant, he was a servant.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[45:01] &gt;&gt; This is what Paul is saying. there be
[45:03] any any fellowship.
[45:05] Fulfill my joy, my desire that you be
[45:07] like-minded, same love, of one accord,
[45:09] one mind. And we what does this look
[45:12] like? Not every man is concerned with
[45:13] himself, but he's concerned about
[45:15] others.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; And so, let this mind be in you. What
[45:19] mind? You could say this mind that he's
[45:20] already recited.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; This mind of love,
[45:25] this this mind of togetherness in one
[45:27] accord. Let this mind be in you.
[45:32] in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 10. Now I
[45:35] beseech you brethren by the name of our
[45:36] Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the
[45:38] same thing
[45:41] and that there be no divisions among you
[45:44] but that you be perfectly joined
[45:45] together in the same mind and the same
[45:46] judgment.
[45:49] In each one of these instances, the
[45:51] reason why I'm reading these things is
[45:52] we've already read where it says serve
[45:53] one another. Bear you one another's
[45:54] burdens. Distribute to the necessity of
[45:56] the saints.
[45:58] Don't forget to communicate. Don't
[45:59] forget to do good. Take up a collection.
[46:02] Give to those that are in need. And
[46:03] there's a lot of requirements and
[46:04] there's a lot of things we say, well,
[46:05] these are the overt acts of Christians
[46:08] is they give of what they have. And we
[46:10] can emphasize THAT A LOT. GIVE, GIVE,
[46:12] GIVE, GIVE. BUT the real heart of it is
[46:15] there that there be no divisions.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; That you be perfectly joined together in
[46:19] the same mind and the same judgment. As
[46:20] you come into more of the unity of the
[46:22] word of God, as you come more into the
[46:23] unity of the faith, then it's just a
[46:25] natural outflow
[46:27] &gt;&gt; to see needs, to see burdens, to see
[46:29] difficulties, TO SEE TRIALS AND WANT TO
[46:31] HELP out
[46:33] &gt;&gt; and feel a genuine burden. Say, oh my,
[46:35] there's a need. Let me help.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; You realize, oh, I I I've looked upon my
[46:42] own needs and I realize there's this
[46:44] need. So, let me give uh not grudgingly,
[46:46] not of necessity, but I'm able to give
[46:48] cheerfully. I'm happy I can help.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to find out you can
[46:52] help?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Like, oh, I didn't know they needed
[46:54] that. I didn't even know that was a
[46:56] need.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 1 verse 27.
[47:02] Again, I'm wanting just to identify in
[47:04] these several scriptures here how they
[47:05] there was a foundation and this uh
[47:11] this growing this cultivation of a
[47:13] spirit of a mindset of a faith. first
[47:16] only let your conversation be as it
[47:18] becometh the gospel of Christ that
[47:20] whether I come and see you or else be
[47:22] absent I may hear of your affairs that
[47:24] you stand fast in one spirit with one
[47:27] mind striving together for the faith of
[47:30] the gospel
[47:32] &gt;&gt; he doesn't just come out the gate and
[47:34] say you guys need to keep giving give
[47:36] your money pay your ti DO THIS DO THAT
[47:39] no he says stand fast in one spirit
[47:43] &gt;&gt; stride together for the faith of the
[47:44] gospel
[47:46] I would much rather that we labor
[47:48] together for the unity of the faith, for
[47:50] the knowledge of the son of God, than to
[47:52] figure out a process whereby we can make
[47:55] sure that everyone's giving enough and
[47:58] that we have enough to do this and that
[48:00] we have programs and we're we're
[48:02] clothing the poor in Uganda and we're
[48:04] building a church in Tanzania and we
[48:07] have all sorts of programs, but yet
[48:08] we're bereft of faith and love and
[48:10] knowledge of God and revelation and
[48:12] we've been able to project all of our
[48:14] inner energies into missions and
[48:16] resources and programs at the sake of
[48:18] what? The real union and togetherness of
[48:21] the BODY OF CHRIST AROUND THE WORD.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; I believe that the word as it's lifted
[48:26] up, as the word is properly taught, it
[48:28] turns us turns us into evangelists for
[48:30] the word.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; It turns us into lovers of others to see
[48:34] souls saved. But you can't make a
[48:36] PROGRAM OUT OF THE RESULT.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE COMMON FOUNDATION
[48:40] FIRST.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S BASED UPON STAND FAST IN ONE
[48:43] SPIRIT WITH ONE MIND STRIVE TOGETHER FOR
[48:45] THE FAITH OF THE GOSPEL. NOT NOT JUST
[48:48] THE PROMOTION of it, but the faith of it
[48:50] first.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; This has been working just fine until
[48:56] brother Aiel showed up. I'm just
[48:58] kidding. It's not your fault. He's like,
[48:59] "Oh my god, I'm not sitting on the front
[49:00] row ever again." I don't know why it's
[49:02] doing this. Apologies to the parents of
[49:04] just joking. Rowan usually gets all the
[49:06] beef. Aren't you glad to share it now?
[49:12] community,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Christ Church and a Christian.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; The Christian is a part of the body of
[49:21] Christ.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Serving the body of Christ.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; The mentality isn't, oh, community, what
[49:29] can it do for me? Ask not what your
[49:32] church can do for you.
[49:35] It's this the you're compelled then as a
[49:39] member of this body, not this local
[49:41] church, but the body of Christ to serve
[49:44] the body of Christ.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; And therefore, God knowing that that's
[49:48] going to be a hunger, a thirst within
[49:49] any real believer's heart provides
[49:51] opportunities such as a local church.
[49:52] And we're not the only one locally.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; There's many, many churches that you
[49:56] could be a part of. But it becomes a
[49:58] place where you can serve
[50:01] &gt;&gt; this common goal.
[50:03] But when you look at it in the sense of
[50:05] this the body of Christ and his church
[50:07] and you have Christ the church and a
[50:10] Christian
[50:11] that Christian now is being instructed
[50:13] within this context of local churches to
[50:15] serve and to give. But the way the
[50:17] scriptures lay this out is it shifts the
[50:19] focus away from the local church and
[50:22] church services
[50:24] &gt;&gt; to a deeper purpose of Christ. Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; If you read, if we could read all these
[50:30] verses again,
[50:35] &gt;&gt; you could realize that what's being
[50:36] taught here
[50:38] is a life or if I could, if I could put
[50:40] this, a religion, an experience
[50:44] that has heart,
[50:48] &gt;&gt; that has feeling.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Don't just look on your needs. Look on
[50:53] the needs of others. bear you one
[50:55] another's burdens as you see necessities
[50:57] do good to the HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH. IT'S
[50:59] ACTUALLY ASKING YOU WHEN HE SAYS be of
[51:00] one mind, of one love, of one heart.
[51:03] What is he asking you to do? To feel.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; TO TO HAVE HE SAYS DON'T NOT GRUDGINGLY
[51:09] BUT CHEERFULLY.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; And you find that there's a there's an
[51:12] emphasis now on the way that we think,
[51:14] THE WAY THAT WE FEEL, THE WAY THAT WE
[51:15] ACT. AND IF I COULD SAY it this way, I'm
[51:18] being very deliberate to choose this
[51:19] this wording. Religion without emotion
[51:21] is dead.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. RELIGION WITHOUT WITHOUT LIFE IS
[51:25] DEAD.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; WE'RE TAUGHT, BROTHER BRAM SAID, IF IT
[51:27] DOESN'T HAVE LIFE IN IT, BURY IT.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; We should bury it. We if there's no
[51:31] emotion, there's no LIFE IN IT, IT'S
[51:33] DEAD. IT DOES IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; But feeling, emotion, and life are not
[51:38] just displayed in church services.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Feeling, emotion, and life just isn't
[51:43] what we do when we come here.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; We're just dead through the week, then
[51:48] show up ON SUNDAY MORNING. LIFE CHECK.
[51:51] [screaming] AH, I guess I'm alive.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Monday morning at work, I'm going to
[51:57] cheat. I'm going to rob. I'm going to
[51:58] steal. [laughter]
[52:00] Beat the wife when you get home.
[52:02] WEDNESDAY NIGHT, I'M ALIVE.
[52:06] NO. LIFE, FEELING, EMOTION.
[52:09] Formal religion consists of making
[52:11] everything formal. In other words, it's
[52:14] a duty. It's required by law or for
[52:15] wrong motive.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; See, formal religion is starchy and cold
[52:18] and indifferent and doesn't do anything.
[52:20] Full religion is also by prescription
[52:22] loud
[52:24] &gt;&gt; and busy
[52:25] &gt;&gt; and active. BUT IT'S GOT TO HAVE FEELING
[52:28] in it.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; It's got to have and what feeling? Let
[52:32] this mind be in you.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; This togetherness, this sense of duty
[52:37] and responsibility.
[52:40] Christ did not establish a Christian
[52:42] church for church services
[52:44] &gt;&gt; in church sermons. Right?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, this is a very dangerous
[52:50] ground to to stand on as a preacher, is
[52:53] one who is a laboring as a pastor of a
[52:56] church that I I'm here in Phoenix for
[52:58] the sake of church, MOVED HERE TO START
[53:00] A CHURCH, A PASTOR TO CHURCH." HE SAY,
[53:02] "WELL, Christ didn't come to start a
[53:03] church, a local church. He didn't come
[53:06] for church services and sermons." But
[53:08] yet, that's what we have this
[53:09] responsibilityility for as our family
[53:11] and as church. BUT WE REALIZE THAT there
[53:13] is a need for that,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; right? But that's not the ultimate
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Christianity has been turned into the
[53:19] church
[53:20] &gt;&gt; and has been turned into what this is
[53:22] what it's all about. We need to have
[53:23] good church services. We need to have we
[53:25] need to have church order. We need to we
[53:27] need to have good things working as a
[53:28] church. We have programs as a church. We
[53:30] need to feel a part of the church. And
[53:31] the church all along is just the local
[53:33] one.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; It's the one that exists here. It's the
[53:36] one that has these four walls and this
[53:38] parking lot and this structure and this
[53:39] order. But that's not it. Christ and the
[53:42] New Testament. These different dynamics
[53:43] that rose up, church services and
[53:45] sermons are to SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT
[53:47] OF A Christian service.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; YOUR NOT CHURCH SERVICES, BUT YOUR
[53:52] SERVICE IN YOUR HOME, IN YOUR
[53:54] COMMUNITIES AT LARGE, IN YOUR FAMILIES.
[53:56] THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE IS TO SUPPORT YOU
[53:59] IN YOUR CHALLENGE.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Not so we could all just let's just
[54:03] forsake everything we have and come
[54:05] together and this will become your new
[54:08] family. And then we're just going to cut
[54:09] off our families.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; This is your new family now, brother
[54:13] Elazar. I don't want you to ever have
[54:14] anything to do with anybody in New
[54:16] Mexico again. You never leave the state
[54:17] unless you get my permission. This is
[54:19] your new family now.
[54:21] And we laugh maybe nervously,
[54:24] right? Because we've been a part of
[54:26] situations like that before.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have any fellowship outside of
[54:29] the church now. It's just all of And
[54:31] that's how you create a forced negative
[54:34] dynamic of being together.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:38] because it's it's all about optics and
[54:40] politics
[54:42] &gt;&gt; and pretenses and not real feeling
[54:45] &gt;&gt; for the body of Christ.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Things that may be out of your control.
[54:50] You don't have a right to decide this.
[54:51] You don't have a right to judge this.
[54:53] But you have a responsibility for the
[54:55] faith of the gospel.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; In James chapter 1,
[55:00] well, let me ask for permission. May I
[55:03] please continue?
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Sure. James 1:es 21-27.
[55:11] Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[55:13] superfluity superfluity of naughtiness.
[55:17] James has bars. That's a good one there.
[55:19] And receive with meekness the engrafted
[55:21] word which is able to save your souls.
[55:24] This is this is good stuff. Lay apart
[55:27] all filthiness,
[55:29] all this excess of naughtiness. Receive
[55:31] with meekness. There's got to be a
[55:32] receiving of the word of God. All that
[55:34] received the word believed and were
[55:36] baptized, received the word gladly. All
[55:37] that believe were together. Let us
[55:39] receive with meekness the engrafted word
[55:41] which is able to save completely
[55:42] develop, cultivate, enrich, and nourish
[55:44] your souls. Says, "But be ye doers of
[55:47] the word and not hearers only, deceiving
[55:49] your own selves." For if any be a hearer
[55:52] of the word and not a doer, he's like
[55:53] unto a man beholding his natural face in
[55:55] a glass. I think this could be described
[55:57] as the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to
[56:00] come to my church services and say,
[56:01] "Amen.
[56:03] And that's what we do. We just come and
[56:04] Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; or we come and we respond to the word.
[56:07] We're a maners of the word. We're
[56:08] hearers of the word. But it says you've
[56:10] got to be a doer, not just a hearer.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[56:12] &gt;&gt; For if any man be a hearer of the word
[56:14] and not a doer, he's like a man
[56:15] beholding his his natural face in a
[56:17] glass. For he beholdeth himself and
[56:19] goeth his way and straightway forgetth
[56:20] what manner of man he was. But who so
[56:23] lookth into the perfect law of liberty?
[56:28] Now notice this perfect law of liberty,
[56:30] like I'm free. where the spirit of the
[56:31] Lord there is liberty. Now we can really
[56:34] be who we're called to be. And notice
[56:36] what he begins to describe and continue
[56:37] there. And he being not a forgetful
[56:39] here, but a doer of the work. This man
[56:41] shall be blessed in his deed. So you're
[56:44] a doer of the work. You're a doer of the
[56:45] word. You're a doer of what you hear. So
[56:46] he says, "If any man among you seem to
[56:48] be religious, embridleth not his tongue,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; but deceiveth his own heart, this man's
[56:55] religion is vain,
[56:58] &gt;&gt; empty, lifeless.
[57:01] So religion with emotion,
[57:04] a religion without emotion is dead. But
[57:06] so is a religion that won't control your
[57:08] tongue,
[57:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; So is a religion that still tends to
[57:12] naughtiness
[57:13] &gt;&gt; and a lack of meekness.
[57:15] So is a religion that tends to arrogance
[57:18] &gt;&gt; and bitterness and mean-spiritedness.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; So is a religion that assassinates other
[57:24] people's character,
[57:25] &gt;&gt; right? So is a religion that allows you
[57:28] to say whatever you want without the
[57:29] fear of God.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Cannot control his tongue. You deceive
[57:33] your heart. This man's religion is vain.
[57:34] And as he's talking about hearing the
[57:36] word, the engrafted word, being a doer
[57:38] of the word, and being blessed in your
[57:40] deed, he says pure religion and
[57:41] undefiled before God and the father is
[57:43] this.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; To shout, to dance, to speak with
[57:47] tongues, to lay hands on the sick, and
[57:49] they recover. And wait,
[57:53] the copy and paste failed me. No, he
[57:55] says to visit the fatherless and widows
[57:58] in their affliction
[58:00] and to keep himself unspotted from the
[58:02] world.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; That's pure religion.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; No wonder they're losing their religion
[58:08] in the 80s. Pure religion and undefiled
[58:11] before God and the father is to visit
[58:13] the fatherless and the widows in their
[58:15] affliction.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; That's pure religion.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Remember James will go on to explore
[58:22] you. you you say you have faith without
[58:24] works. I'll show you my faith by my
[58:26] works.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; This is where James is going to explore
[58:29] this in great detail and he's going to
[58:31] uncover these different principles. I
[58:32] think I've held some of these things for
[58:34] a later service. But as he's saying
[58:36] these things about a one who uh from the
[58:39] fountain precedes different things and
[58:41] how we act and how we ask and these
[58:43] things that we uh cultivate in our lives
[58:45] and this outflowing of our faith. He
[58:47] says faith without works is dead.
[58:50] And the works HE'S REFERRING TO AREN'T
[58:52] THE KIND OF WORKS that any one of us can
[58:55] uh uh uh that he's not referring to
[58:57] works that we would just merely try to
[58:59] assimilate
[59:01] &gt;&gt; and do easily,
[59:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; But it's actually works that the Bible
[59:06] says is a sacrifice
[59:08] unto God
[59:10] &gt;&gt; that pleases God.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:13] As we read in the scripture, it says God
[59:15] God enjoys, he's pleased with that
[59:18] sacrifice.
[59:20] God loves a cheerful giver.
[59:30] Musicians, if you could come,
[59:36] do good, communicate,
[59:39] for with these sacrifices, God is well
[59:41] pleased.
[59:44] We bring the sacrifice of praise
[59:47] into your house. You can do that. But
[59:50] what about the sacrifice of doing good?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; What about the sacrifice for the sake of
[59:56] the body? What about the giving?
[59:59] Pure religion and undefiled is to visit
[1:00:01] the fatherless and the widows. What is
[1:00:03] he referring to? He's talking about a
[1:00:04] religion that's real.
[1:00:08] Now, we could create a program where
[1:00:10] what we do is we visit the fatherless
[1:00:13] and widows and we have this program
[1:00:14] where we're just going to go to
[1:00:15] community centers and we're going to
[1:00:17] have an outreach in Sun City. We're
[1:00:18] going to try to find the widows and
[1:00:19] we're going to serve the widows and
[1:00:21] we're going to try to find the orphans.
[1:00:22] We're going to serve the orphans and we
[1:00:23] can bind up our identity in supporting
[1:00:26] orphanages and supporting widows and
[1:00:28] tell ourselves that's religion.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; But James isn't [music] advocating for
[1:00:35] that. He's talking about receiving the
[1:00:38] word of God in faith being known by your
[1:00:41] works and how that a living faith, a
[1:00:44] real faith has feeling. It has life in
[1:00:46] it.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; It's animated according to the gospel.
[1:00:49] It serves others. That is eternal life.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; So many different ways that we could go
[1:00:57] with this, but I was reading in the
[1:00:58] sermon, a man running from the presence
[1:00:59] of the Lord. This is so beautiful.
[1:01:01] Listen to this. It's a little bit
[1:01:02] lengthy, but I want you to really just
[1:01:04] hear [music] this. He says, "We find out
[1:01:06] that so many have easy ways to go." He's
[1:01:10] talking about a man running from the
[1:01:11] presence of the Lord is Jonah. He goes,
[1:01:13] "Ships going down to Tarsus for it's
[1:01:15] easy." And he uses the phrase the
[1:01:17] unresponsibilities.
[1:01:19] Reminds me of George Bush saying he's
[1:01:20] the decider. The unresponsibilities.
[1:01:25] It just flows in. You have everything
[1:01:27] coming. [music] Everybody likes you.
[1:01:29] Nobody disagree with you. You disagree
[1:01:32] with nobody. I'm liking this.
[1:01:36] Now, if that ain't a dish rag, you push
[1:01:38] over, flop over. Why? Anybody? I don't
[1:01:40] care who you are, what you're standing
[1:01:42] for. Decent thinking people will think
[1:01:45] more of you if you'll stand for your
[1:01:46] conviction of what's right.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; So, reading this, in other words,
[1:01:51] there's a we can just go an easy way,
[1:01:53] but there's a way [music] that we ought
[1:01:54] to live our lives that maybe is against
[1:01:56] the grain.
[1:01:59] He says, "Take [music] a woman. She
[1:02:00] might not be very attractive, whatever
[1:02:02] she is, but you let a woman stand for
[1:02:03] principles of womanhood. Let her stand
[1:02:05] like a lady. If a man's got to ounce a
[1:02:07] man about him, he'll take up for her. We
[1:02:09] appreciate something that somebody has
[1:02:11] that they believe it's the truth [music]
[1:02:13] and will stand for what they think is
[1:02:14] right. I I feel this way. You see,
[1:02:17] people make difficult decisions and say,
[1:02:19] "Well, I don't agree with you, and so I
[1:02:22] I've got to make this difficult
[1:02:23] decision." If they do it with respect,
[1:02:25] you can admire that.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; How wishy-washy. That's what too many
[1:02:30] Christians today are so soft soaked in
[1:02:32] everything till they think all they do
[1:02:33] is join church,
[1:02:35] go in somewhere and put their name on
[1:02:36] the book. So there's that kind of what
[1:02:38] we call formalism, intellectualism,
[1:02:40] starchy, formal church joiners.
[1:02:43] It's maybe this uh we we've got it
[1:02:46] figured, we got the fundamentals figured
[1:02:47] out. Let's just put those in place and
[1:02:48] now we're a Christian. He says, OR DO A
[1:02:50] LITTLE SOMETHING, JUMP UP AND DOWN,
[1:02:52] SHOUT or something like that and call it
[1:02:53] Christianity. All right. So now they're
[1:02:55] all they're all the same thing anyways,
[1:02:57] right?
[1:02:58] the the intellectual and the emotional
[1:03:00] are the same person.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Christianity is an everyday
[1:03:06] rugged life living for God in this
[1:03:09] present world. It's a constant burning
[1:03:12] of the fire and love of God in the heart
[1:03:14] that sets you a fire and puts you out
[1:03:16] yonder with the people in making
[1:03:18] converts to Christ." [music] He says,
[1:03:20] "Responsibilities."
[1:03:22] Notice that Christianity isn't at every
[1:03:25] Sunday morning life or a Saturday night
[1:03:28] of a conference life, but it's an
[1:03:30] everyday rugged life living for God. Not
[1:03:33] in church, but in this present world
[1:03:34] with THE CONSTANT BURNING FIRE, NOT TO
[1:03:36] RUN PEWS and to shout and to dance or
[1:03:38] just to join a church, but with THE LOVE
[1:03:40] OF GOD THAT SETS YOU ON fire amongst
[1:03:43] people
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; so that the WARMTH OF YOUR LIFE COULD
[1:03:46] CONVERT OTHERS TO CHRIST. [music] He
[1:03:48] says, "Responsibility."
[1:03:50] But it's easy to go the way the world
[1:03:52] goes. It's easy to flow downstream. Go
[1:03:55] out there and set down the river with
[1:03:56] your boat, get your oars, and start
[1:03:58] pulling against the current. You don't
[1:03:59] make much time. It goes hard.
[1:04:01] But once you let loose the oars, and
[1:04:03] watch how fast you pass the trees
[1:04:05] going down. But look where you're going.
[1:04:08] [music] When things are floating easy,
[1:04:11] remember you're going towards a great
[1:04:13] waterfall, great cataract down there of
[1:04:14] some sort. You're going toward the
[1:04:16] falls. and it won't be long you'll go
[1:04:18] over the falls just floating with the
[1:04:20] world easy the way it goes. He says you
[1:04:22] don't want that. You must accept your
[1:04:26] responsibility.
[1:04:28] What is your responsibility?
[1:04:31] It's a good question. But you have a
[1:04:33] responsibility. [music]
[1:04:35] You may look at these things and be so
[1:04:37] convinced of and say, "Well, brother
[1:04:38] Aaron's made a really strong case that
[1:04:39] if I'm going to be a Christian, I'm
[1:04:40] going to have a responsibility beyond
[1:04:42] myself. I'm gonna have responsibility to
[1:04:44] the body of Christ. I'm at a
[1:04:45] responsibility [music] a as as a member
[1:04:47] of the body of Christ and I don't want
[1:04:49] that.
[1:04:51] So I I I'm just going to begin to
[1:04:53] forsake [music]
[1:04:54] my responsibility as a Christian. You
[1:04:56] know, some people do that.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; They protest. And how do they protest?
[1:05:00] They stop supporting.
[1:05:03] They they stop [music] they stop being a
[1:05:05] part of the body of Christ. They stop
[1:05:08] giving of their resource. And they have
[1:05:09] a lot of excuses and sometimes a lot of
[1:05:10] good reasons to do it. It's not that
[1:05:12] they just came up with it on their own,
[1:05:14] but they're abused. They're mistreated.
[1:05:15] They don't like this reflection. They
[1:05:16] don't like certain things. And so they
[1:05:17] say, "Well, I don't want to have
[1:05:18] anything to do with it." But look into
[1:05:19] the word of God today and recognize you
[1:05:21] do have a responsibility.
[1:05:24] It's a responsibility that's not born
[1:05:26] from being told you have a
[1:05:27] responsibility, but by being a Christian
[1:05:30] by by the the truth being preached by,
[1:05:33] as maybe we'll explore this in more
[1:05:35] detail, by coming of same mind, by
[1:05:37] speaking the truth in love, by by
[1:05:39] feeding on the same word, we're becoming
[1:05:41] one. We're becoming united. And as
[1:05:43] that's lifted up, as that's promoted,
[1:05:45] then the [music] rest begins to take
[1:05:46] care of itself.
[1:05:49] You have a responsibility as a
[1:05:51] Christian. You have a responsibility to
[1:05:53] Christ and his church. And as a church,
[1:05:56] we want to we want to give you
[1:05:57] opportunities to fulfill your
[1:05:59] responsibility. If we could stand
[1:06:00] together this evening,
[1:06:04] let's pray. Our heavenly father,
[1:06:06] tonight, Lord, as we bow our heads,
[1:06:07] we're asking [music] for grace, just a
[1:06:10] uh a grace upon our lives that we could
[1:06:13] rightly divide the word of truth. Lord,
[1:06:16] I could just do
[1:06:19] a search in scripture, not just a word
[1:06:21] search and but just take time to comb
[1:06:24] [music] through the pages and just
[1:06:25] believe that I'm following the
[1:06:26] leadership of the Holy Spirit to
[1:06:27] identify these different scriptures that
[1:06:29] speak of
[1:06:31] this responsibility that a member of the
[1:06:33] body of Christ has, a Christian has to
[1:06:37] Christ [music] church
[1:06:39] and how it worked out in the book of
[1:06:40] Acts and how it worked out in the church
[1:06:42] at [music] Corenth and in Galatia and
[1:06:44] all these different uh ways that the
[1:06:46] individual the Christian being a part of
[1:06:49] Christ's body served the church through
[1:06:53] the means of a local body through the
[1:06:55] means of a local gathering and
[1:06:57] ministries in [music] those local who
[1:06:59] could receive the the the distributions
[1:07:01] and make sure they got to the right
[1:07:03] place and just the giving as they would
[1:07:05] weekly that would actually [music]
[1:07:06] support their gathering together and the
[1:07:08] deacons looking out after certain
[1:07:09] things. We just see a beautiful picture
[1:07:11] painted in the scripture.
[1:07:15] But Lord, I just I don't want to just
[1:07:17] put these [music] things together in
[1:07:19] such a way to where we can be convinced.
[1:07:20] Yeah, I got to look on the needs of
[1:07:21] others. Yeah, I got to give and I got to
[1:07:23] do this. I got to do that. But Lord, may
[1:07:24] we recognize [music] that there was
[1:07:26] something
[1:07:28] genuine about the unity, about the
[1:07:30] togetherness, about the goal,
[1:07:35] that it was the faith of the gospel, the
[1:07:37] one faith, the one Lord, the one
[1:07:39] baptism. That's what they were united
[1:07:41] around.
[1:07:43] That's what they desired at the end of
[1:07:44] the day would be promoted. That's what
[1:07:45] they desired at the end of the day would
[1:07:47] receive receive the have the
[1:07:49] preeminence. So Lord, I'm not trying to
[1:07:51] turn ourselves around to where we can
[1:07:52] [music] back into community by doing
[1:07:54] community service,
[1:07:57] but Lord, may we become so rooted and
[1:07:59] grounded in your word that we could
[1:08:00] recognize our responsibility as
[1:08:02] Christians to [music] do service. And as
[1:08:04] a church, may we provide opportunities
[1:08:06] for those responsibilities to be
[1:08:07] fulfilled. Encourage and inspire others,
[1:08:10] maybe to take initiative in certain
[1:08:12] areas.
[1:08:14] May we be sensitive to your leading,
[1:08:16] Lord. We commit ourselves to you in the
[1:08:18] name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:20] Amen.
