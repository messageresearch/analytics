TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I trust you're all doing well this morning and feel good by God's grace and if you don't uh if you don't feel well you have to resist the urge to feel like the way I feel now there's a way it's always been and the way that it's always going to be but know that uh with God everything gets gooder and gooder and whatever ails you and whatever you're experiencing whatever you're going through God is always faithful to meet us in our needs and bring us out of whatever it is we're going through and I do believe that this the sun has risen upon God's elect and that no matter what we go through every obstacle every challenge every battle you know has to have in it somewhere good Victory and overcoming no matter what it is you know if a challenge meets you you got to know that it's pregnant with victory for you if you're in a battle you got to know hey the battle has Victory inside of it for you and that's kind of optimism we can have as Christians now I'm going to start a new um subtitle so to speak with worldly kingdoms and I've actually decided to not even capitalize the world and not even capitalize kingdoms because I don't want to give any glory and honor to these worldly kingdoms but I believe it's important to look at them and as we've been speaking about the kingdom of God and what it relates to and even Heaven's mystery and Earth's Glory these things I hope maybe maybe it's a very big picture but I just hope in different places pieces are coming together but I have chosen to approach I want to look at the kingdoms of this world and Satan's kingdoms and I believe it's necessary because it they are the enemies to God's kingdom and to the kingdom that we're speaking about and so it's very important and today we'll just begin to lay some pieces in there that I believe will expose Satan's tactics and help us to understand uh more because I know that you understand it but in a greater way the greatest battle ever fought and just how the devil is trying to attack Us in very unique ways to try to hinder the kingdom and we know that the kingdom is the king God is to be established in the hearts of his children we see that from the parable and the kingdom of God is within you and that to me is just a it's a mind-blowing mystery and the more that I study this the clearer the picture gets but that's what God's wanting to do is he's wanting to establish the kingdom in you as has already been prayed this morning I would say the kingdom is in you the kingdom is here and so those are things that the devil is fighting against and we've been taking this statement from the sermon the countdown as a principle that we're building off of where he says as science achieves something looking backwards so science achieved something no matter how much it may seem like it progresses it's regressing that's oh that's a that you know you know combustion engines this is awesome this is great right everyone thought it was the most wonderful thing ever when they invented combustion engines and science says we've gone forward now what are they all saying it's marched just backwards right and now they're trying to figure out a way to get rid of combustion engines because that's Satan's the kingdoms of this world or science achieves always going backwards and has to deal with the consequences and Fallout of their achievements but God achieves going this way going forward to the kingdom whatever God does he moves closer to the kingdom even if it seems that God takes something away he only does that to advance you further to the kingdom you say oh well I've been I've been fought against and I've been attacked or this has happened or that's happened God's only doing it because he wants the kingdom to come into preeminence and so God achieves whether it be by addition or subtraction God achieves going forward to the kingdom and Satan will do anything and he and it kind of reminds me of the underminer you know there's nothing beneath him like the stoop as low as he can to do anything to try to keep us from going forward to the kingdom that's his objective is to keep the Kingdom from coming into manifestation so I want to use worldly kingdoms to identify and even just uh use this moment and this Parable to identify Satan's kingdoms and his tactics because like science he's behind science it's regressive and I believe that Satan does not want uh the kingdom seeds that are in us that lay within us to be expressed or come to full manifestation and I want to use this statement from the fourth seal and I'm using this uh to introduce a couple principles uh that we're not I don't want to review the sermons we've already Minister on this but this will just kind of help us capture something as we go forward brother Bram is recounting a conversation I was walking to a person talking to a person not long ago and he's trying to discuss with me saying aren't you ashamed to say that God created the heavens and earth in six days I said that's what the Bible said and so the response is well we've got evidence and can prove that the world is millions of years old and so that's uh that's the response the scientist right we can prove it that we have done the testing and the testing cannot fail the testing says that what we the material we are examining is millions of years old and brother Brown's response is that didn't have anything to do with it I gotta be careful sometimes when we try to debate the scientists and and the evolutionist and those things he says in Genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning God created heavens and earth period that's all now the world was with world without form and void he said I see I said I believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something oh that's a remarkable statement and and we've already examined how that uh the word of God shows us that all the seeds were there by the spoken word of God and it took light to bring it forth and manifest it so in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and the spoken words of the original seed and God puts things into the Earth and so just imagine that if the seed was millions of years old all right the elements the very things as a matter of fact they might find that their testing is wrong and some of these things actually on a million years old they're eternal and just the they can only read so far they've got like computers that won't make it past the year 2000 and so it says I believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off the light Struck it up come the trees and everything so this is this is how God has brought forth all creation is the seeds of the Kingdom were already in the earth and framed it with this this image of in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and then the man and the woman were in this Garden of pleasure in God's Eden naked and unashamed that's all God's word seed bringing forth if it's kind and that ends the that's the end of Genesis chapter two this is what happens so he says the same thing with the human being so now we're going to see us it's a type when all the Mist is moved away and the revealed truth to that real seed Lane there still germatized in the light of the Gospel can Strike It by a true Vindication of the word it'll live it's got life in it and so that's what we have inside of us we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that when the light of God's word can break away all the mist and all the unbelief and all the callousness I know sometimes we we have it in our minds that well if you're the elect seed of God all you got to do is just read the Bible and hear the word and as soon as it strikes you then something's going to happen and brother bam says usually they catch it this quick but sometimes we've been raised in ways and taught in certain ways and treated in certain ways and abused in certain ways and all sorts of things have happened do we have a little bit more mist and thick clouds in our spirits and things that we have to overcome and God is faithful to just keep driving it away and driving it away and for some it may take longer but eventually that seed must come forth because it's got life in it now that's the seeds of the Kingdom those are the seeds that God sowed in the beginning and we can go back to the beginning to find the good seed that God sowed but now if we looked at the worldly kingdoms we can just go back we go back to the beginning to see the seeds of the Kingdom well we can do the same thing for the kingdoms of this world and there is let me say this and I'll come back to it um I have got so much to preach it's awesome and uh and I'm thinking about adding Services here and there and we can just go back to zoom Church for some of you and I know some of you some of you just cringed uh but in Revelations 21 and 22 is we've kind of touched on it quite a bit that shows us the glory of the Kingdom in its full manifestation seed sown in Genesis 1 we go to the end here it is here it is and it's a good seat as the scripture tells us good seed fully harvested so I want to go back to Genesis and find the seed that the wicked one sold to build worldly kingdoms and the nature that's behind it so if you look at Matthew chapter 13 verses 38 to 39 and says the field is the word the world excuse me the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one that's just a mouthful I mean what he is saying especially to a Jew is just one of these things where they're they're picking up what he's laying down even to the point where like I know exactly what you're saying and what you're trying to say and and there's this and I think they wanted him to be wrong in a lot of things and that's where their wrestling was is man this guy speaks truth this guy has wisdom we don't know it we keep trying to trip him up and he has a way to answer it the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom so you are The Good Seed I says but the tares are the children of the wicked one and he says the enemy that sold them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels now there's a lot in there where we looked at how had to wait to the time of the Harvest before they could uh separate them out and I want to just take a few moments to set this up and if I have to slow down uh that may be an answer to prayer for some but if I have to slow down and make the point this is a very important point I want to make but I want to draw uh I'll just warn you ahead of time I'm gonna draw from Shakespeare to make my point and these tears that are here I think we say the good seed are the children of the kingdom and and we could spend time on The Good Seed but now that it's these tares that I want to look at this morning and and that the the word that is used there for Tears it's agreed to across the board everywhere that this would be a particular plant that is just a weed a Darnell plant our zazonian is the Greek word that's used and it's actually called This is the I wouldn't say a technical term but this is how it's referred to in Horticulture is wheat's evil twin and so there is wheat that is sown into the in the field that's sown into the the world the wheat represents the children of the Kingdom but now you have a tears and the tares are weeds evil twin why because it looks just like wheat before full maturity that up until that moment when it's actually harvested into that moment where it can be harvested it can by all appearances look just like wheat but this Darnell though it may look like wheat it can't doesn't function in the same way that we can because it is a poison and so the tares The Good Seed is harvestable wheat productive wheat and we could just use the example of wheat seed and what it can produce and how it's good for food and bread but the tears are wheat's evil twin and it's a poison and eating the seeds of the Darnell plant will make you dizzy make you off balance and nauseous and actually can be deadly so this is a poison seed that Jesus is saying is sown into the field that if one eats it can become cause you to become nauseous and off balance and lose control and actually Darnell comes from the root Latin drunk so it's a it's a weed that causes one to become intoxicated and causes one to uh now I feel like there's so many weed jokes we can start telling but there it is it is something that influences and poisons causes one to become nauseous and it's deadly it can lead to death it's actually called a mimic weed and this mimic weed it called a mimic weed because it's not entirely wild but not quite tame it's a mimic weed it's like they can't say it's completely wild but it's not completely tame because it looks and behaves like wheat it looks and behaves like this other plant uh but yet it requires human assistance in order to survive they actually call them stowaway seeds to where they're they're not planted themselves they're not tame where you would sow them intentionally and plant them and harvest them they stow away with other seeds and their survival requires human assistance and so what it means is it's it stows away it it's in the other grain it's mixed in with all the other good seed and being mixed in there it's planted at the same time as the good seed and then as it grows up you can't distinguish it from The Good Seed you'll only know in the end uh when it when it comes forth that it's the wrong seed so what happens is it ends up growing up with the rest of the wheat and it gets harvested with it and then plant it again so it has been harvested replanted harvested replanted and that's why it's not quite entirely wild but it's not entirely tame I came across an article in the Journal of ethnobiology it was laying on one of your coffee tables when I was over for dinner but the Journal of ethnobiology didn't even know it existed but they wrote an article on the Darnell plant several years ago and they called a symbol of malign subversion now someone could say well yeah of course because Look what Jesus had to say about it it's like all right exactly got a little bit because science is a little self-aware now and they're looking at this and they're recognizing what this plant is it's a symbol of malign subversion and they wrote this where there is Darnell there is treachery in toxicity this is what they have to say about the tares and this is exactly the image that Jesus is wanting us to catch he says I sowed good seed and that seed would bring forth of its kind and it's going to produce a particular nature and have a particular expression and look a certain way but the wicked one came and sowed tears and these tares are a poison and wherever these tares uh plant or planted there is treachery in toxicity it is aligned it is a malign subversion it is poisonous it intoxicates it causes one to become a nauseous and it can even lead to death and Madness and it is you'll find once you start looking at this and you start trying to find this plant you'll find it in a lot of different places Shakespeare used in a number of several of his plays I think three or four and one in particular on King Lear and it's about the downfall of a king and how he loses his kingdom and he loses his family he loses his mind and so this is this is the story that is being portrayed by uh Shakespeare and and I guess if I'm just using maybe one's interpretation of it and I find found this quite frequently is those that would analyze the the the the play that this was a king who by his arrogance an excessive Pride he loses his daughter he loses his most faithful servant the people that loved him truly that were faithful to him stood by his side that would never do him any harm because of his Madness his increasing Madness his lack of discernment his lack of wisdom he ends up losing everything that was good and right and even loses his kingdom so it's about a king who loses the kingdom and it says in the play that his crown this is where the Darnell comes in I know you're somebody you're just saying just get there my goodness gracious you didn't like it in high school and you don't like it now but the crown was made up of all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn so he was given a crown and this Crown was made up of these weeds or if we could even maybe surmise that it was mixed in it that they were wanting to use something but mixed into this Crown the crown was made with all the idleweeds the Darnell that grows up with the corn so though he had a crown there was poison that was mixed up in it and what's what's kind of represented by this when I read it this is what strikes me that the king's Madness was symptomatic of Darnell poisoning that the very way he's acting and the way he's living and the way that he's deciding the way he's viewing his own children and the way that he's viewed his kingdom and his faithful um servants he is it is indicative that he has been eating Darnell and the way it struck me is the King was drunk on his crown he was eating the crown and because there was poison in the crown because there was poison in the power because there was Darnell sewn into it it perverted his character and it intoxicated him and it corrupted him because he's feeding on that power apart from character is satanic but Power with characters fit to rule and and here's a king who got drunk on his own power and drank the Kool-Aid so to speak or drank the punch or drank the things and and intoxicated him caused him to lose his mind and lose his discernment I I see even the image of Saul in this and these are the seeds that Jesus says the wicked one is sown into Humanity so look at how literature takes the Darnell Terror these are what the tares are it's a poison I just want to zero on that the aspect that Darnell the tares are a poison God sows good seed but then the tares are rep are a poison weed a stowaway it's gonna it's gonna piggyback off of the fact that you don't plow a field and you don't get it already in order to plant Darnell you do it to plant wheat so then the wicked one takes advantage of the fact that the field is ready the field is cultivated it's good ground it can nurture and germatize there's life everything there that the wheat needs the the enemy knows that he can use what's already been there by Spoken Word creation he can use what's already there in order to poison that's the key poison the the kingdom of God poison Humanity I want to call it the devil's poison and I think that maybe we'd be able to point this out but if I if I fail to come back to it the devil well as a matter of fact another thing I probably keep saying that I probably say it 12 times so whoever keeps counts of track of these things here's check one the devil can't create he doesn't have a seed so how does he get how does he poison good seed and in Genesis chapter 3 and I'm going way too slow this morning and there's a lot that I want to bring out that I'm not going to be able to do this morning but I feel there's just a direct point that I want to make this morning to help us understand the kingdom of God that is within us but in Genesis chapter 3 we know the devil is in the Garden of Eden sowing the seeds of another kingdom and again the wicked one cannot create so maybe I could help you count he has not the power he does not have a seed but we'll come to some scriptures in a moment he wants his own kingdom he he he wants to be worshiped he wants to have power and since he can't create his own kingdom he can't create his own world he has to use what exists and he cannot transform it he can only deform it or pervert it so now we'll go to Genesis 3 1. we've seen the framing the book ends Genesis 1 Genesis 2 in the beginning was the word in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth we've come we've fast forwarded to see the full fruits of that in Revelations 21 and 22 but now Genesis 3 and I think we've already touched on this a little bit it says now the serpent which is coming from the word enchanter was more subtle than any beast and is tied with lamenting and was more subtle than any beast of the field which Lord God had made so now he's wanting just to recognize that this serpent was a beast of the field and he's very subtle of all the animal life of all these creatures and he apparently could talk we know according to the scripture he could apparently walk and he said unto the woman so now this is his first tactic he says yeh hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden now there this is where I could get sidetracked there's a reason why he went to the woman he there's a reason why he went to her and there's a reason why he's talking to her and this question of you shall not eat of every tree of the garden I'm not even going to get into the woman's answer but let me just say that his question may seem like an affirmation well didn't brother Branham say s doesn't the Bible say and so he's quoting God in such a way that it could provoke an affirmation that well God said you can't eat of every tree in the in the garden and so it's even in a way trying to establish some the woman's confidence that he knows what he's talking about establishing some common ground or that we have a meeting of the minds right will you believe God sent a prophet and will you believe this and there's a little bit of a kind of can we can we find Common Ground some space to work within and once he's been able to do that he says does he not say that you shall not eat of the tree of the garden now he spoke now I'm I'm doing this uh and it is maybe very meticulous and and I didn't choose the hottest day of the year to do this intentionally but this is this is important I believe this is very very important he speaks and as he speaks the woman is going to be receiving these words so now he's trying to use his spoken word and Jesus says in John 8 44 year of your father the devil and the lust of your father will he do so now the Devil is a father and it's a father that brings forth by lust so lust is sown into the nature he was a murderer and I I'll we'll clarify as we continue this is your father the devil and we think oh they're literally the spawn of Satan well it has to do with his will not his seed because he doesn't have one because he cannot create you have your father the devil and the lust your father you will do he was now a murderer from the beginning now I know in our minds we go to King but Cain Now is acting out the murderous spirit and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it notice how the devil the the devil is called the father your father the devil the lust of your father so he's saying in a way that you are now progeny of the devil but notice that he is given credit of being a father of dishonesty like he says he's only given credit for creating dishonesty so let me give him credit for being the father of lies because I'm because he's the father of Lies he cannot bring forth life he can only bring forth death and it says that he is you're of your father the devil the lust of your father you will do that means he what he's trying to recognize is that you have come because of a liar you're of your father the devil well where's the kinship oh the devil is the father of lies and it took a lie to bring us forth in the way that we are and so it's trying to get us to understand why things are the way they are why it looks the way they do and why sometimes that wait we think the way we think so he's the father of Lies he says he's a murderer from the beginning Satan was a murderer from the beginning because he desired and acted to ruin Humanity to murder its influence to ruin the children of the Kingdom he was a murderer from the beginning who wanted to take away life and so it's his word of unbelief and doubt that acts as a poison upon the seed so when he says ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden that on its face may seem to be an innocent question but it's a lie it's a lie but he has no power of the spoken word to create and so Satan's poison breath if you study the message you'll find that he's and what I'd want you to look at this morning let's just read it from God's power to transform that just watch how he manipulates how he contrives watch how he postures watch how he politics because this is this is plain and simple what he's trying to use against the woman are not the tactics that God uses Satan wants the kingdom Satan uses certain tactics to build his kingdom to defend his kingdom to represent his kingdom God doesn't use those tactics he uses fear and intimidation and bullying there's a way that he was trying to work against the woman's nature to supplant but God doesn't use the same tactics and God's power to transform he says like Satan at the beginning when he come into the Garden of Eden he could not dig up those seeds he could not destroy them but he sprayed them with poison and it deformed the seed it didn't bring forth of its being forth Its Right Kind it deformed The Original Seed so can you recognize Satan is a deformer and the way that he's using it is Satan used he can't dig up the seeds right so he couldn't go into the field and dig up all the good seed and destroy it and then put his Bad Seed in there he had to find a way to deform the seed that was there and he says it deformed The Original Seed now and that's he says and that's what all these programs of religion so now we've got to realize whoa organize religion and religion how the leaven that's in it and the danger of the poison and intoxication and the poison that's in the crown he says they're still Sons and Daughters of God but it's being deformed that means there's real genuine children of God who find themselves in situations where they're not being nurtured to express the word they're being deformed and it's hurting their discernment it's hurting their nature it's hurting their families it's hurting their environment it's hurting their atmosphere and we have to be very careful with her nothing but a bunch of you know unborn again degenerates so hold on they may only be doing that because of poison what else do you expect if things are sold into someone's garden they're they're just gonna they're gonna get out of it listen that's exactly what God made the woman to be whatever you put in her is what you get out and so sometimes people are just sitting there and they're receiving all sorts of deformities and all sorts of attitudes and all sorts of seeds and because they're good ground right they're just going to be manifesting it and you may look at that say oh I don't like that prickly nature I don't like their attitude I don't like their cynicism I don't like their critical nature they're in the wrong kind of program all it produces the deformity and this is where brother Branham touches on this uh the the heaviness of it they go to church wanting to do right a nun never enters a nunnery to be a mean woman a minister never goes through school just to be a bad man never joined church and Shake Hands put your name on a book or whatever you do in your church to be a bad person I hope you're listening you do that to be a good person people that go to church are not doing it they're not doing it to raise a flag of you know of obstinence here they're doing it because they're being genuine but it's deception it's the deformity that does it it says Satan sprayed it Satan's poison has many good people bound many good people drunk you'll find even in the King Lear how there was times where even in his madness he seemed to have more of an awareness than when he was in his right mind because why and it's hard at his core maybe a good man maybe a good person good relationships with his daughters and trusted these servants and there are certain things that maybe are certain ones and there's things that you say oh there's good in this person there's glimpses this is this is great but then you see the madness and you see the poison they're drunk with poison it deforms the expression and I'm wanting you to recognize how that brother Branham says Satan at the beginning sprayed the good seed with poison because God sows good seed now Satan cannot just sow a seed of evil because he cannot create evil are we at four now and since he cannot do that he has to find a way those are nice New Balance Rowan I like that and those are new he has to find a way to cause an imbalance right he's got to find a way to poison it so I'm going to skip what the woman has this saying come to verse 4 and Genesis 3. and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die wait what now in the beginning well God said you hasn't he said you could eat of every tree of the the uh in the garden but now when the woman says but if we eat that one we die and now notice how it's just again Satan cannot create a kingdom he cannot create a world so he has to pervert what already exists so now that he has already begun to work on her and find is finding his way into the ground his with the poison of unbelief and doubt because that's what he uses those are the that's the formula that Satan uses is unbelief and doubt and once he uses that notice how easily he uses an outright lie hey so this is just me dramatizing this that God does not write the story to say that as the serpent walked by the woman one day he says you know that if you eat that tree you won't die it's not what he starts with there's some other pretense there's trying to form some sort of Alliance and some appearance of while we're together in this and are we all God's creation shouldn't we all just get along and there's some appearances that are being expressed there and being set out in this image and once he establishes that he has no problem now you can go to the Bible and find this over and over and over again to the nature of the wicked they have no problem just outright lying in fabricating complete absolute dishonesty without any conscience you know why they'd convinced themselves that their objective is right in any means they can justify even to the point to where I remember brother Randy you're the one that told me this some men ungodly men rose up against brother bisco and begin to sow poison and when their plan failed they confessed to brother Randy well 90 percent of it was lies anyways but at least some of it was truth I might have got the percentages wrong they have no problem no problem even admitting to dishonesty because they've convinced themselves that their objective is right so he resorts to an outright lie lies are at the heart of Satan's kingdom now pay very careful attention if you would to the nature of the poison that's being spread into the world God sowed good seed now the wicked one is coming and he's sowing bad seed it was uh I know that we've touched on this in the past that there is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil in the Tree of Life what Satan wants is the Tree of Life he cannot create only pervert therefore what he's trying to gain access to is that which can bring forth life he's wanting to find a way that he can bring forth his own and he knew according to Genesis 1 that the seed was according to Genesis chapter one The the seed was in each specie to bring forth after its kind he knows this God has spoken he sees God in creation that God has put within each specie each plant each tree each Beast that there is a fruit there is a seed inside of it to bring forth of its kind so what Satan accomplishes in Genesis 3 is a mixture of trees he takes a seed of the beast of the field and the seed of the woman and he mixes the trees together so he takes the tree of man and the tree of the Beast of a beast and he mixes it by using the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil notice the tree of not the knowledge of Good and Evil and I know these things are symbolic in their representation that that's a mixed Tree in itself and so he is mixing these things together and Jesus God had said of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it remember he said devil said You shall not surely die he said Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so there there are seeds that God planted that are good seeds and if those seeds mix it brings forth death and God's judgment upon those that mix is death so by high breeding by mixing the trees it changes God's original program and so death is sown into it death is there and now judgment is upon because you remember God said about Adam and the woman that guard the Tree of Life lest they partake of it and never die so it is it is by the punishment of God that they their life expires but now and there's death upon the race but there's a way that if they took the tree of life they live forever but Satan mixes the seeds and that brings death because of God's law God said it and then the consequence of this original sin and this is a lot to chew on and we could go through this in Greater detail Through the Bible but the consequence of the original sin is a poison nature that's completely incongruent a discrepancy completely incongruent with the original word it is not the nature of what God originally sowed it's poison nature it's poison nature that builds worldly kingdoms from that moment on as we'll look at this all the kingdoms of the world and all that is in the world and all that is in the flesh has come by way of this poison in Isaiah chapter 14 verses 12 to 14 . speaking of Lucifer oh Howard thou fallen from heaven son of the morning oh Lucifer son of morning how about thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations Satan weakened the word there's disabled the Nations the word that's used Nations there is a word that's used for Humanity in general Satan weakened Humanity because of verses 13 and 14. God had sowed good seed there was the potential within that seed to bring forth man because Adam is man Humanity mankind and then Satan found a way to weaken or disable humanity and he says you were cut down to the ground and you weakened the Nations he's cast down to Earth from heaven he weakens the Nations and this is why this is his because of this and by his ambition in these two verses for thou has said in thy heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my Throne a kingdom is what he's after above the stars of God he's been cast down to Earth but now he wants to rise above heaven the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north beautiful imagery and symbolism there I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud I will be like the most high notice how that his only way is to Aspire to ascend but it's God who descends Satan is only wanting to ascend but God desires to descend not God it's Satan wants to go to heaven but God wants to bring Heaven to Earth and pride if you look at this pride and Prestige as Satan begins to talk and God begins to reveal what's in his heart these are elements I want you to recognize the worldly kingdoms these are the seeds that are sown in the beginning uh the he's the father of Lies dishonesty now you can begin to see this Pride this Prestige the pretense that's his poison he wants a beautiful kingdom he wants a powerful Kingdom brother Branham is going to quote from Ezekiel 28 he says watch the evil controls of this world now these are this is the evil that controls the world in Ezekiel 28 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and saying thus saith the Lord God and you'll see that this is an image of Satan thou seal us up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty and and what that phrase means is you draw a picture of yourself you form an image of yourself and you represent yourself as the Perfection of wisdom and beauty so Satan's kingdom is pretense false seeds a false Beauty pretense are his seeds this is I want you to recognize the seeds of his kingdom how Satan moves the politics the pretense the prestiges The Pride the way that he works and this is thou has been in the garden of God every precious stone was not covering so it says thou has been in the garden of God Genesis chapter 3. and then it says every precious stone was thy covering now that that is an interesting way of placing it the Sardis topaz Diamond Borough Onyx Jasper Sapphire Emerald carbuncle and gold so you have all these precious stones and then the gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in the end the day that thou was created and it says iniquity was found within them uh within the anointed cherub and and there was uh there was no sin no iniquity and then his imperfections when uh until the iniquity was found in them is that we could continue to read but we're not going to do it but God is using the king of Tyrus to show Satan's ambition this is the embodiment of Lucifer's agenda God is using this as it would be a pronounced on uh whoever this King was and whoever it represented he I mean he couldn't have been in the Garden of Eden the literal King a prince at that time could not have been a Garden of Eden but he's using this king's arrogance he's using this king's pride he's using the pretense of his kingdom and all of his power to show Satan's ambition in the beginning it even says in Ezekiel in that chapter verse 6 he set his heart as the heart of God oh my think of that kind of wickedness he set his heart as the heart of God why because he wants to be worshiped as God he craves popularity he creates power and if I can say this if if in the way that I'm wording it to this point because I I'm beginning to recognize now that some of these uh some of the ways that I'm wanting to bring this into a more direct application or maybe a little bit further away for us today if you're having if you're having the first instinct is to begin to look out when these things are brought up that's fine but just be sure you come back to this right be sure to just kind of look at yourself be like okay right these are the things of the world this this is the enmity in every human being and for him he craves popularity he craves power but he can only he he cannot create right he can only pervert he can only impersonate he's a mimic weed it's a stowaway seed it's wheat's evil twin is what he's going to produce and so notice how that his covering is Sardis topaz Diamond Burl Onyx and Jasper Sapphire all these elements that we would find represented in the Earth and then we also find it's represented in the New Jerusalem when God is describing the Lamb's wife as a city the foundation the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the foundation was Jasper Sapphire calcutty Emerald sardonyx Sardis crystallite Burl topaz christopherus Jason amethyst these are all the the the gemstones in the foundation of the city of God what is Satan trying to do he's trying to present himself as what God's trying to achieve God made the Earth for a purpose if I could just do this in type in the Earth are precious stones the Earth by pressure and by our composition and by nature and nurture is producing gemstones within its crust within its atmospheres below and then those emeralds and those diamonds and these pearls and these things that are being formed by the elements that are within the Earth God made the Earth to bring a bride out of it the most important thing there is in the Earth today is getting a bride out of the earth that's the most important job and so Satan wants to mimic and he wants to set forth an image to say I have achieved a bride from the earth because look at all the elements and all the images and all the pearls and all the gold and all the wisdom and all the power and all the beauty it's a false Church you'll find it in Babylon we'll come to it later the seeds of Genesis 3 you'll begin to find in Revelation 17 and Revelations 18. so mimicry is his method religion uh religion is is part of his poison is deforming power just remember that how he uses mimicry and if I could say this the instruments the instruments that build worldly kingdoms the things that Satan used both in ambition in tactics to build his kingdom are the same today and so the beginning of worldly kingdoms uh this is you know I sometimes take surveys so this is a little pop-up in the middle of the sermon that you've gotta you gotta answer a question before we can go any further those who do continuing education exactly what I'm talking about but this is the point where I say are you are you with me so far can you at least someone you don't have to see the full picture right because no nobody does and no one Minister does see the whole picture so I'm just trying to describe you the part that I see and how that the the tares were sown by the wicked one and the tares are then not good seed it the the the the process is two good seeds out of their place crossing a mixing and that's how Satan gains access so that's I guess that's that's what I'm going to try to show you to the remainder of this service then is if we can see the parable of the kingdom and this the tares are poison it deforms it's going to build worldly kingdoms so in Genesis 4 the beginning of the worldly kingdoms raise up with the birth of twins Cain and Abel remember tear is a mimic weed it's wheat's evil twin so Cain though he's from a mixed tree would look in every way just like Abel every way we look just like Abel and in Genesis Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2 and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived you'll notice in this there's only one knowing and and two conceptions and bearings and she conceived in Bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel I think all agree that there were Twins and Abel was a keeper of sheep and Cain was a tiller of the ground notice they would have been twins when I say they I don't know that they would have been identical I'm not saying they're identical twins but I'm saying you wouldn't be like well one's a donkey one's a a crab right you know but both look like dogs so they both look like cats they both look like there would have been some Affinity with respect to uh species but notice if you could just Ponder this image of how the very first thing that God expresses is what they do enables a keeper of sheep and Cain's a tiller of the ground and remember God called The Serpent a beast of the field and when it came to God acting after sin he slew a lamb enabled by Revelation becomes a keeper of the Sheep and came by education because he's taught that it was fruit becomes a tiller of the ground now when it says that I have gotten a man from the Lord notice how the woman recognizes all life comes from the Lord and the Bible does not say that Cain was begotten by Adam but acquired by Eve Cain means acquired it comes from to lament or well and even kind of has some symmetry with chant why because he's the son of the enchanter even in his name it's trying to create this connect these dots back to the serpent and there's no scripture that directly references Cain as being Adam's son but when the Bible speaks of him he's identified with Satan and as far we've got to recognize that this is to me I know just teaching that I just feel is so important to enter into the record so important if there's going to be an indictment there has to be evidence if there's going to be a Vindication there has to be evidence I'm entering evidence and in first John chapter 3 verse 12 not as Cain who is of that Wicked one and slew his brother and why did he slay him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous now we know that Cain was not the literal seed of Satan but he was vicariously of Satan through the influence of the serpent this is the law of genetics the law of heredity the law that nature is going to be passed by those that are bred together and so the law genetics say that the the child or the progeny received the traits and characteristics from the father and the mother all right that's why if anybody asks you what that baby looks like you just say he looks just like his dad and mom it's the only safe answer there is it looks just like his dad and mom and if they say well he's adopted say I'm telling you I don't know what they look like I just know that's what he looks like it's always a way out of it but that's why because it's going to be mom and dad this helps us understand original sin we really got to recognize these aspects of original sin because the the serpent seed so to speak is not Satan as a man producing his own creation or bringing forth his own life but it's taking elements of man and Beast so Cain had DNA and nature from Eve the woman that's why she's the mother of all living but then also took a nature from the serpent so he received the nature of The Serpent and the woman so serpent seed is just a mixed nature I think the devil tries to obviously right he wants to cast uh some questions on the the DNA testing you can't rely on those tests you know he wants he doesn't want us to recognize and this is why he attacks this Doctrine so vehemently is because it exposes him and he wants us to kind of present it as well you know it was this and this is what happened is this but we got to just recognize it for what it was it's a mixed nature that's why in the Judgment he says I'm going to put enmity meaning they can't mix anymore and so now watch Cain's nature and I'm just touching this quick I don't know if we'll come back to it at another time but I just want you to see this Cain Now talks in verse 8 chapter 4 came talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field oh I'd love to know that conversation I wonder if it started with did not God say and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him wheat's evil twin is drunk with rage the terror now the poison is set in and now there has not been the only murder there was in the beginning was the intent of Satan through the serpent and now in a jealous rage he acts as jealousy notes these are the these are the seeds of the Kingdom they even find with Joseph and his Brethren why did they throw him in a pit why did they sell them in slavery jealousy these are these are the marks of worldly kingdoms his wheat's evil twin now Cain as a tear he is now there's a mixture there he's like his mommy's like his daddy he doesn't maybe know who his daddy is but he's a mixture there and the nature of the worldly kingdom is manifesting itself and it manifests in Murder and if we were to look at I did we were keeping a scorecard all the nature of the worldly Kingdom it manifests in Pride and pretense and politics and hatred and jealousy and murder all the fruits of the flesh as the Bible calls it find all the things that in the New Testament they start identifying as these are the fruits of the flesh these are the Deeds of the flesh these are the Deeds of the flesh these are the Deeds of the flesh this is the these are the worldly kingdoms and so just to summarize I want to move on the world lady this there's a different nature can we agree there's a different nature exhibited by Cain if you have Adam and the woman living in imperfect Harmony everything's great and wonderful one day the woman eats an apple ah man you shouldn't have done that that was wrong we got to leave our house we've been evicted and all because mom ate an apple Cain's got these kind of behavior problems we're doomed right we are in big trouble if that's all it takes for your son to be a murderer no wonder we have so many serial killers these days right because all she did was eat the wrong kind of fruit and all of a sudden her Kenya just just wait till you start having kids right and that's what they all say well I can't wait till you have teenagers I don't know how many parents have wished failure on their kids well you think your kids are good now just wait and then you know I guess the right response is well I guess they do have your nature somehow foreign but it's a different nature exhibited by Cain he manifests he's manifesting traits and characteristics of a poisoned seed I say well then what made the serpent so bad good question maybe I should have researched that before I ask there's a rule in trial law write this down you'll be tested on this later never ask a question you don't know the answer to all we're getting and it's best just to ask questions that are yes or no or doesn't matter how they answer it the point's already been made you want to argue with me come on now and brother man says this it's all just have brother Brandon asked the questions Church age book chapter three now why did this have to be so he's referring specifically to the original sin and the resulting consequences why did this have to be so why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way good questions right wow wow wow to this answer Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple remember Satan wants to set in the throne and be worshiped as God even his ambition in the end the Antichrist what we see in King Tyrus and the serpent in the beginning is exhibited the representative of Satan and the Antichrist he says Man was created for God man was to be a temple of God the place of God's rest was man and notice how God has to express himself as Holy Spirit to do that was man the temple this is the kingdom God desired Heaven resident with men Heaven and Earth fastened together now I'm going to have to go very quickly here through some principles but he says Man was created for God man was to be a temple of God and in Genesis 2 1-3 thus the heavens and the Earth were finished because we're looking at God's rest the Heaven and Earth are finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made so notice what's implied he's resting and not just from work because that's what we look at our Saturdays as oh I'm taking a day off for some people Sundays I don't want to go anywhere do anything this is my day off but it's not that he stops working his work is done he sowed the seeds and now that the heavens and earth are finished listen now that that's finished he can rest because that's where he wants to be that's where he wants to dwell that's where he's expressed that's where he's made known as a lonely god with no nothing else you can't know him so he has to create if I could say a theater he asked to create something that can manifest his hidden Glory manifest who he is and he says I'll use Heaven and Earth so when he creates and it says and all Heaven Earth is finished now God rests not from work but in his work nothing better for a man than the labor and enjoyed the fruits of his labor so now God is resting in his creation God is coming down in the cool of the evening God is fellowship me with man and the woman he is reflected in his creation all the material is laid out he says now I just need to walk with it now I just need to fellowship with it I don't need to work anymore I just have to be and the becoming God will bring the life out of the seed that's there so there is in his Temple in his creation with man Heaven and Earth and in Acts chapter 7 watch this verses 46 to 51 speaking of David who found favor before God and desire to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house he wanted a plate what's a house it's the way dwells it's his habitations where he finds rest this is where he returns how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands I saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool he's given himself dimensions Heaven is my Throne Earth is my footstool on one hand saying how can you build me a house when Heaven's my throne and Earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest half thought my hand made all these things oh my goodness this beautiful picture in other words man cannot build a suitable Tabernacle for God we can't we don't have enough AC units we don't have enough spackle we don't have enough gingerbread we don't have enough crown mold and we don't have enough we don't have enough balconies oh there's just no way that you can build a suitable suitable Tabernacle for God because man cannot do it but what does he say has not my hand made all these things why because God man doesn't make God a tabernacle God made man the Tabernacle to be the temple he said Heaven's my throne and not just heaven but Earth is my footstool and so he says as Solomon built him a house when he says Heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool the prophet Isaiah is not only wanting us to get an image of the Tabernacle which brings Heaven and Earth together but also not just Solomon's Temple but also Solomon's throne brought into the image of God's kingdom and notice what it says about Solomon's throne in second chronicles 9 17-19 moreover the king made a great Throne of Ivory and overlaid it with pure gold and there were six steps to the throne with the footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne notice that it's not something distinctly separate but he takes heaven in fascinates to fastens it to the Earth and it's overlaid with gold speak the ivory and the Purity and the white but now it's overlaid for gold he's trying to express his habitation Heavens my Throne Earth is my footstool unless you think that's a doormat and you think that's just something under my feet to describe what I mean by my kingdom but no it's not just my subjects but it's those that will actually be in the throne with me that'll rise up through seven Church ages that'll not only just be brought up into another kingdom but I'll fasten it together by deity footstool fastened to the throne he says there's not like any made in the Kingdom this is a throne remember Satan wanted a throne this is the Throne of his this was the Throne of his ambition and so God ordained man if I could say to be the base of his throne footstool that's that that link just like if let's just read it and question answers on Genesis just like Adam in the beginning when he was made he was Supernatural he's made Supernatural and then a body is made from the Earth so God ordained man Heaven the throne to be fastened to the Earth and so notice what he does it's just it's just like heaven in Adam who's from the Earth and brother Bram says in question answers on Genesis he formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground a dust of the earth and put a supernatural the supernatural spirit now he was laying there he says I can have many pictures of it I can see Adam standing let's take it this way see him standing like a tree God made him he was dead as he could be his toes like the roots sticking in the ground fastened to the Earth this is this is the earth now being brought up and Heaven coming down the Supernatural and the natural it's the only way you can have Supernatural right right if all you have if you didn't have natural you just have super hey so in order to have the supernatural he had to have the natural die so here he is Earth coming up Heaven coming down to be embodied and reflected in Adam who represents Heaven and Earth and hidden in the earth is Heaven's mystery of a bride a woman that's going to come forth here it is forming up and his toes are in the earth like roots sticking to the ground and God breathed the Breath of Life in him and he jumped and came to himself breathe the Breath of Life in him and he became a living Soul let me say this is the temple this is the Tabernacle this is the throne this is the kingdom these are the seeds that God sowed God had ordained the Earth to manifest Heaven's Glory this mystery is hidden Adam now God is bringing up we see it's fastened the throne is being fastened to Earth because Adam we know there's a king on Earth now I got carried away there this is why this is the reason for the original sin everything I just expressed to you I Amplified brother I said Man was created for God man was to be a temple of God and he's saying that to answer the question why did this have to be why did the seat of the serpent have to come this way the reason he's asking and then I say this is the reason why because man was the temple this is the reason why it came the way it did this is the reason why it had to come the way it did because Satan knew this Satan knew this all along and so he had that's where he goes for his to get his kingdom I said but Aaron where did you get that uh Chapter 3 of the church age book Satan has known this all along he had one job is it not in there I had one job Satan has known this all along he wants to dwell in man even as God so does Satan has known this all along he also wants to indwell man even as God so does why did it have to be this way why did everything come this way because Satan knew all along that that was God's Temple and God's Tabernacle he can't build his own but he can deform it he can't create his own but he can desecrate it he can pervert it he can deform he can defile he can poison Satan wanted to end dwell man as God does but God has reserved to himself that right Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh oh Satan could not and cannot do that we have to be talking about the original you'll see this he does not have creative powers are we counting does that count as eight the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine of gatara you know in the scripture when the the evil spirits were cast out a legion and it went into the swine and and and I think kind of the history teaches us unless you get kind of upset that those Farmers living was ruined as I believe that the the the mythology is that those were Jews who shouldn't have been hurting them to begin with right and so the the evil spirits could enter into swine could enter into animals we could see that from scripture he said but God does not enter animals if you have any trouble at all figuring that out just buy a cat stick with me brother Micah but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by Eve as God did by Mary so he entered into the serpent and then beguiled Eve he seduced her and by her did Satan have a child vicariously so he's not the literal spawn of Satan he is not the literal seed of Satan but Satan was able to access the serpent and influence him to mix Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic Central fleshly characteristics of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one he was out if I'm running out of time then let me say this do you notice what happened then you say well how come why didn't God just in why didn't the serpent just indwell the woman why don't he just go go to Adam he couldn't Adam couldn't just be there and all of a sudden be possessed with an evil spirit it was impossible but the serpent could be influenced and so now the serpent realizes I have no access to man I can't get into man I I can't I can't work in his mind I can't possess him I can't influence him I can't I can't get in there I can't organically get into him so what he does is he gets into the serpent and he causes her to bring forth the child that now that he's hybrid that's a nature that God did not reserve for himself to dwell in so now he can embody and inhabit any flesh that comes hybrid and if I could say this worldly kingdoms only exist because Satan's poisonous influence and so what he does is he uses God's original seeds and he mixes them to create something that he could access it's a an evil twin one he can't get into how come he didn't get into able and make him offer fruit of the ground why did he just possess him why didn't they just why didn't they do a murder suicide just end it all right there just take care of it boom it's over we're all dead we're all done all there's all there is left is a bunch of snakes he couldn't get in it but he used God's original seeds and brother Branham says we don't want any of your mixed trees we don't want none of your mixed trees denominations think of that market denomination think of the mark of the serpent seed think of the marks of these things it's a mixed well a mark of a worldly kingdom is a mixed tree anything mixed is denominational what we look for is the denomination right and that and then we and then we deduce a mixed tree if you see a mixed tree it's denominational but this is how Satan gets access to the the kingdom of man is through mixed flesh this is how he's worshiped as God this is why there's death there's death in anything mixed anything hybrid brother Bram says in God's power to transform I'm wrapping this up quickly how he says now how the poison is struck the Earth struck the struck the church struck the Earth Satan's poison upon the seeds has put cavities in it and cause it to be deformed more and more he sinks deep into the heart of the hearts of the churches and of the hearts of the people and everything science science just permeating until it become a place where the human race being interbred I believe every seed should bring forth of its kind in the human race and the plant are all being interbred and has brought us to a place and eating our food from the earth our bodies have made hybrid it's put our whole Minds I know it's kind of chopped pieces but if our bodies are falling from 20 to 25 years old because of degenerated cells by hybrid Foods don't our brain cells degenerate I think I think he's he's asking us rhetorical because I think he's assuming that everybody would recognize this and say if hybrid foods and what do they champion in more and more of these days is all these processed foods and hybrid foods are destroying the body and they don't realize what it's doing to the mind and all the dysmorphia and all the confusion and everything but these things are on the increase because of hybriding and he says isn't that also that's why he says Ricky's run to the street with a hot rod Ricotta and alvidas many of them as we would call names out here half naked before the people mentally gone the Darnell the poison no more conceptions of decency or morals that's just in that the natural I'm thinking the religious Realm think of the place that it's come to even in the religious realm where there's just there's no decency there's no respect there's no Integrity there's no love there's no real love he says it's Poison Poison Poison Poison as I said before I want to end on this thought well I think I'm at eight so Satan could not create he can only pervert and Adam and the woman could not be possessed by Satan could not be possessed by Satan but the serpent could and then only the woman by Free Will could make a choice Satan could not dwell in Adam Satan could not dwell in the woman he had no access to their soul by virtue of the pure seed why because man was reserved for God Satan could have tried to get there but realized I'm walled off I can't so I've got to produce an evil twin that looks like the original atom but it's not entirely the original atom not quite a tame but not fully wild I've got to create a Darnell I got to create a tear and I'm going to do it through this mixing I'm going to solve this poison into this race and once I can get a mixed seed just as I could inhabit the Beast of the field I can inhabit anything that's hybrid with that nature and that's what gives rise to demon possession and the whole world has been brought forth through this hybriding and now man yet is still reserved Kate was a hybrid excuse me Kane was a hybrid therefore he could be possessed that's why brother Brown says he bore the spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic characteristics of the serpent and then in Luke 22 3 then entered Satan into Judas named Iscariot it shows the inspiration behind worldly kingdoms it shows Adam could not be possessed by Satan so he used Cain or Abel couldn't be possessed so he used Cain use Kane to do what tried to destroy the pure the good and the Bible shows us just as the spirit of Satan Satan entered into Judas he could have never done that to the woman he could have never done that to Adam he couldn't have done it to Abel but he did it to Cain musicians ready yourselves get ready I apologize for the cat comment I Need You Now fake fake of the Kingdom implications if this is how and I know it's just a really small picture but if we've come up to that point and there's good seed and there's bad seed and all that is in the world is the sin the World the Flesh the devil all these things lust of the eyes the pride of life less of the Flesh and all this is what exists within our Natures by our first birth and this is where everything is and then that I think that definitely sets forth the worldly kingdoms and where we're going to be tracking but think of it on the other hand what it means to be a part of the Kingdom now this is where I'd say invert always invert I mean because we could just kind of get real dour on the worldly kingdoms but then what is God wanting us to recognize about the kingdom think of what this means there are there is a race of people if I could put it this this way there are a people that God has ordained that would be his habitation and brother Branham says this he writes us continuing in the church age book well let me let's read from Matthew chapter 3 verses 16 and 17. I I do want to go ahead and finish with this and I gotta get I got to get myself lined up here I have some more things I want to read and uh he says this and the seat of the wind was literally well Matthew chapter three let me read this thing first and Jesus when he was baptized because he's the seed of went upstairs and law the heavens were opened up unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and law a voice from heaven now the sun is in the water on Earth and the Earth this body that God had created from the same created those cells and the the egg and the sperm and the woman and brought forth this body he is the seed of the woman as the scripture says he's standing on Earth in the water and the voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased but not just who I'm happy with but in whom I'm pleased to dwell because the heavens open up and the spirit of God the Holy Spirit coming back to its Tabernacle I mean to its Temple and it comes down to heaven and it dwells the Son of God I say this is the kingdom this is Heaven and Earth kissing this is heaven Earth embracing this is God saying this is what I've longed for when man lost his glory I couldn't come back and fully dwell and inhabit an animal I can't inhabit a beast I can't inhabit a brute so I'll bring forth one who is bypassed the hybridian who's bypassed the poison who's bypassed the tariffs and that's one I can dwell in that's what I can live in that's the one that I can come back into and that's the one I reserve the right man is reserved God Alone appeared in human flesh let me say this if I can say in its purest form Satan has not appeared in human flesh God has only appeared in human flesh what you see is a deformed hybrid what you battle with what you struggle with what horrifies you what you detest it's not the real genuine seed it's the poison deformity but inside of you is a seed of Heaven brother Bradham says as a seed of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh so now we have to see the contrast so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race if you thought I had come up with some kind of newfangled Theory brother Brown just wrote it explicitly in the church age book that this is how he opened the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself so the Genesis account tells us how he produced his seed and introduced or injected himself into the human race and recall that Satan is called the serpent it is his Cedar injection of the human race we are speaking of wow this answers a lot of questions and now you have then the kingdom and if I could say this the kingdom is its own thing it has no rivalry right yeah it just it's the greatest it's the most premium it's the it it's the original everything else is fake everything else is an imposter you know who creates the Rivalry the little imp that wanted to be this and can never be it right that's the original Short Man complex hey hey you you think they invented this I mean that's what Satan Satan knows that's him yeah right he's brought down to the Earth and he's the one that Rivals he hates God's Kingdom so he's bent he set against the kingdom of God everything he does is intent on destroying the kingdom of God and because he does that he gets trapped in the works of his own hands he comes with death and God's kingdom just repels death he comes a disease and God's kingdom just repels diseases that's why we're taught to just take it as we come to it we don't have to pick fights we don't have to go devil hunting just live the life live the Kingdom Life the kingdom is what God desired worldly kingdoms have made themselves Rivals and enemies to God's kingdom and remember the enemy of your enemy is your friend and that's why you see all the allegiances you do today is not because there's actually the kingdom rivalry against Satan no because the truth is hated by the LIE and I say it's the end of time I'm gonna it's the end of the sermon dogs and cat lovers alike come to your instruments I say it's it's that now we have the worldly kingdoms coming against God's kingdom why is Darkness Gathering to Gathering against the light It's The End Time Showdown you start studying Mount Zion I think there's been a line drawn I see it more and more pronounced in the scripture I want you to hear this let me just read this to you as our musicians play um I'm just going to read this in Ezekiel the word of the Lord came again unto me saying son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus because we've we've seen his ambition right now let's listen to this the seeds have been sown thus saith the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am a god I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yea thou art a man and not God I think brother Fulcher would like that though thou set thine heart as the heart of God behold wiser there is no secret that they can hide from thee with thy wisdom and with thy understanding thou has gotten the riches and has gotten gold and silver into thy Treasures by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus saith the Lord God because thou has set thine heart as the heart of God behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee Hallelujah I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the Nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit Thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the Seas wilt thou yet save before him that saith Thee I am God but Thou shalt be a man and know God in the hand of him that slayeth thee Thou shalt died the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for I have spoken it saith the Lord God oh Hallelujah there will be a people that overthrow the king of Tyrus that overthrow Lucifer's ambitions oh it continues in verse 16 by the multitude of thy merchandise they have failed think of Revelation 17 and 18 filled the midst of thee with violence they thou and thou has sinned therefore I will cast this profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thine Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before Kings Hallelujah lazy before kings that they may behold thee thou Hast defile thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore I bring a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour Thee I will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all them that behold thee all they that Know Thee among the people shall be astonished at thee they shall be there thou shall be a terror and never shalt thou be any more Hallelujah there will be an end to these worldly kingdoms they will disappear they will be vanquished oh he'll lay them before Kings I say let the Kings arise let the Kings and Priests take their position and brother Branham says and why little Bethlehem showing all these things yeah I think I could say this I I'm getting such more and more I guess I am so turned off by worldly kingdoms I have such a distaste for these things Brotherhood says oh Warrior will you pull the sword of God and say I'm free with these Traditions I'm coming back to the word I'm coming back to truth I say who will pull their sword who will draw their sword the king sword so I'm sick of tradition I'm sick of church entity I'm sick of all this thing all these things I'm sick of the worldly kingdoms of Pride and pretense and posturing and politics I'm sick of these things I'm going to draw the king sword will you pull the sword through a denominationalism I'm through with these things I want to take my place in the Kingdom praise the Lord could you rise to your feet
