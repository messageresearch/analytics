[0:00] I don't think it'd be difficult to pick
[0:02] up on what we're wanting to minister on
[0:03] just by reading that it really is the
[0:06] the scene that I hope to end on in
[0:09] picturing Samson in this situation with
[0:12] his head upon Delilah's lap and his
[0:14] Seven Locks being cut off I think it's a
[0:17] very uh striking picture so as we
[0:20] continue on the subject of the house of
[0:22] the Lord I want to do part five on The
[0:24] Big Three we're taking the three
[0:26] Temptations of Jesus the three
[0:28] Temptations of ministers churches
[0:30] organizations and individuals and
[0:33] looking at them from the standpoint in
[0:35] first John of the lust of the flesh the
[0:37] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[0:39] I'd say that's the scriptural big three
[0:42] and how that those three correspond to
[0:44] money women and popularity and as we
[0:47] look at this we're wanting to identify
[0:49] Satan's uh Mo for our lives how he
[0:52] approaches us how he attacks us uh how
[0:54] that he attacks ministers how he attacks
[0:56] churches organizations how he approached
[0:59] the woman in the garden how he
[1:00] approached Jesus in the wilderness and
[1:03] it's exposing his tactics the way that
[1:05] he works so as we go through these and
[1:08] you you might be young enough to say
[1:09] well I don't have money problems but
[1:11] that could be uh it present itself in a
[1:14] different way you say well I'm I'm not
[1:16] I'm too young I don't have lust problems
[1:18] but Satan has ways of approaching the
[1:21] youngest even to the oldest in all these
[1:23] different categories to try to stumble
[1:25] us and we looked at Jude verse 11 and it
[1:29] says woe unto them for they have gone in
[1:31] the way of Cain and ran greedily after
[1:35] the ER of balam for reward and perished
[1:38] in the gainsaying of Kora briefly we've
[1:40] touched on a couple times how that the
[1:42] gainsaying of Kora is that popularity or
[1:45] the pride of life we could see that in
[1:47] the scripture and the way of Cain this
[1:50] would be that lust of the eye and uh uh
[1:53] women we could we'll be able to see that
[1:55] how that works together in the way of
[1:57] Cain but last two Services we looked at
[2:00] the heir of balum I I want to set this
[2:02] forth just to uh kind of bring us up to
[2:05] speed before we get into the lust of the
[2:07] eyes that's the lust of the flesh or the
[2:09] love of money and it's
[2:13] primarily uh Associated when you have
[2:15] the lust of the flesh it's satisfying
[2:17] the needs of the body the wants of the
[2:18] body whether it be meat or drink uh kind
[2:21] of those satisfying the animalistic uh
[2:24] desires that we may have these urges we
[2:26] might have in our flesh and that's uh
[2:29] can be rep represented in money it's
[2:30] represented the lust of the Flesh and
[2:32] brother bam said balam's problem was
[2:33] money and in numbers
[2:37] 22:32 I'm pulling this out uh just to
[2:40] rehearse how that balum as we read
[2:42] through things we see that balum doesn't
[2:45] appear to be uh doing what bik wanted
[2:48] him to do he seems to be upright he
[2:49] seems to prophesy the right things but
[2:52] yet there was telltale signs in his life
[2:55] that what he was motivated by and what
[2:57] he ultimately wanted wasn't to honor the
[2:59] word it they just paid lip service to it
[3:01] but in his heart was this greed as the
[3:03] Bible says they ran greedily after the
[3:05] heir of balum for reward and this is
[3:08] when the angel Lord stood and the donkey
[3:10] that he was riding on could see it and
[3:12] was trying to keep him from going and
[3:13] finally it speaks to him but bam had
[3:16] smote it three times and the angel lord
[3:18] said why hast thou smitten thine ass
[3:20] these three times behold I went out to
[3:23] stop you to withstand thee because thy
[3:25] way is perverse before me so his way it
[3:30] was his habit or his moral character his
[3:33] character was perverse and perverse
[3:35] means Reckless it might have seemed like
[3:38] he was doing good it might have seemed
[3:39] like he was doing the right thing but
[3:41] his way was perverse his moral character
[3:44] his attitude his motive and objective
[3:46] was Reckless and remember that the
[3:48] things on the outside don't necessar
[3:51] aren't necessarily indicative of one's
[3:53] character but it's the the character of
[3:55] the Soul what's on the inside that
[3:57] determines how one stands before God and
[4:00] so God looks at him says it may look
[4:02] like you're saying no it may look like
[4:03] you're being honest and upright but you
[4:05] never told him that I said not to curse
[4:07] him and you never waited for them to
[4:09] come and get you you just left on your
[4:11] own accord so your way your character is
[4:13] reckless before me why was it Reckless
[4:16] as long as he kept hanging out with bck
[4:18] he was going to constantly be tempted to
[4:20] do something that God said he should not
[4:23] do and that was tempt uh that was to
[4:26] curse Israel and in in numbers 22:34
[4:31] balam said unto the angel Lord I have
[4:32] sinned for I knew not that thou stood Us
[4:35] in the way against me now therefore if
[4:37] it displease Thee I will get me back
[4:40] again it sounds like man balum what a
[4:42] good guy but it was not it seems as if
[4:46] God knew at that point that God already
[4:48] said your ways perverse and that what he
[4:51] ought have done is just humbled himself
[4:52] and said you know what you're right Lord
[4:54] I haven't been honest I'm driven by the
[4:56] wrong things there should have been some
[4:58] sort of awareness that he comes to him
[5:01] in the midst of all this to say you've
[5:03] already told me my way is perverse I
[5:05] know that what I'm doing displeases you
[5:07] let me go back I I realize I'm not being
[5:09] fully honest I didn't wait for the
[5:10] princes to come ask for me I didn't tell
[5:12] them that I shouldn't curse them and so
[5:14] what does God do God allowed it because
[5:17] he knew his way was still perverse he
[5:19] knew his heart was far from him and so
[5:21] balum is blind to his fault he doesn't
[5:25] see it he doesn't see how Reckless he
[5:27] has being because he's driven by the
[5:29] lust of the flesh he's driven by money
[5:32] and brother bam said when a man gets his
[5:34] mind on money he loses God when that
[5:37] becomes our meditation when that becomes
[5:39] our objective when that becomes what
[5:41] drives us when a man gets his mind on
[5:43] money he loses
[5:46] God now let's look at as we're kind of
[5:49] wrapping up a little bit there on the
[5:50] lust of the Flesh and there's a lot more
[5:52] that could be ministered on that aspect
[5:54] but I'm wanting just to be very direct
[5:55] on these big three and and just to get
[5:58] them out there but the lust to the eyes
[6:01] now this would be as we said before kind
[6:02] of that appeal to eyes and the process
[6:05] the mental process that goes with it
[6:07] eyesight is more than just the
[6:10] Optics uh of uh seeing something and the
[6:13] mechanics of seeing something but
[6:14] there's that visual part of it in the
[6:16] mind that translates the data that's
[6:19] being sent yeah and and causes some sort
[6:22] of response or some sort of perception
[6:25] uh we know in the Bible that when the
[6:26] man that was blind and could not see and
[6:28] the Lord touched him and he sees and he
[6:30] says I see every man uh as trees walking
[6:34] man as trees walking he's saying that
[6:36] he's indicating that the Optics are
[6:39] healed the physical part is healed the
[6:40] wiring is correct whatever malady was
[6:42] there had been healed but his mind that
[6:45] spiritual part of that mind part the
[6:46] mental part that interprets the data
[6:48] that the eye is giving and then provokes
[6:51] some sort of image or response that part
[6:53] had not been healed yet so that when he
[6:55] prays for him the second time it's not
[6:57] because his first prayer was ineffective
[6:59] God was trying to show us something in
[7:01] that and then he heals his mind and he
[7:03] basically gives him the data of someone
[7:05] who had lived his whole life to be able
[7:07] to see every man clearly someone who has
[7:10] their Optics healed late in life can
[7:12] look at someone's face and not tell if
[7:14] they're sad or mad or happy or glad
[7:17] they'll just look at them and they they
[7:19] don't know what a smile is they don't
[7:20] know what a frown is to them the Moon is
[7:22] so close they could touch it uh they
[7:24] can't they don't have depth perception
[7:25] they would trip over a curb they can't
[7:27] make distinctions and it's not because
[7:29] because the eye doesn't work itself
[7:31] physically but it's the mind so when we
[7:33] talk about the lust of the eyes it's not
[7:35] just what's seen but it's the pleasures
[7:37] of the imagination it's the mental
[7:39] processes that go with it and the lust
[7:42] of the eyes is this instinct to Value
[7:44] things that are new like the iOS 18
[7:47] those of you who want it just become one
[7:49] of those the get on the developer beta
[7:51] and you can start uh impressing your
[7:53] friends with uh things that they don't
[7:55] have and so there's a way that you're
[7:56] drawn to the new you're drawn to things
[7:58] that are fun or beautiful and it's the
[8:00] process of the eye working together with
[8:02] human emotions to produce a response the
[8:05] lust of the eyes is associated with
[8:07] jealousy and vanity those empty things
[8:10] and those corrupting things when you
[8:12] behold something with the eye it's a
[8:14] gateway to then desire it with the heart
[8:17] in Luke chapter 4 when Satan took Jesus
[8:20] upon a high mountain took him up and
[8:21] showed him all the worldly kingdoms and
[8:23] their full glory in one moment of time
[8:26] that he was tempting Jesus with the lust
[8:28] of the eyes to see glory and Grandeur
[8:30] and power and then for him to begin to
[8:32] covet it and say I'll give this to you
[8:35] if you just bow to me and that was Jesus
[8:37] being tempted with the lust of the eyes
[8:40] in Genesis 3: 6 it says and when the
[8:42] woman saw that the tree was pleasant to
[8:45] the eyes it was emotionally stimulating
[8:47] not just visually pleasing in an optical
[8:50] sense like that's a really beautiful
[8:52] Apple but it it kind of provoked
[8:54] thoughts in her mind and her heart and
[8:56] she commits the ACT first in that that
[8:58] pleasantness as she sees it it's
[9:00] emotionally stimulating and she desires
[9:03] it so it's not just the act of enjoying
[9:05] something that's beautiful or enjoying
[9:07] the the side of something attractive but
[9:10] it's the lust of the eyes is when it
[9:11] provokes you to do more thinking to do
[9:14] more pondering and to act upon It
[9:17] ultimately it's why Jesus says in
[9:19] Matthew 5: 28 we'll read verse 29
[9:22] towards the end but I say unto you that
[9:24] whosoever lookth on a woman to lust
[9:26] after her hath committed adultery with
[9:28] her already in his heart that's right to
[9:31] look at the woman it's to see with the
[9:34] Mind's Eye not just to see it but to see
[9:36] it with the Mind's Eye wherein You
[9:38] observe and then
[9:40] contemplate and so there may be some
[9:42] instinct to see something and when you
[9:44] see it uh it might catch your attention
[9:47] and the eye is processing things but
[9:48] there's a way that you can just let the
[9:50] thoughts linger I believe the story is
[9:52] told in brother bam says that uh there's
[9:55] these thoughts come into someone's mind
[9:56] and they have these horrible thoughts
[9:58] and and brother bam Council was well you
[10:00] can't keep them from Landing but you can
[10:02] certainly stop them from roosting and
[10:04] nesting and making a home there and he
[10:06] even tells a story how one time uh there
[10:09] this brother was in a prayer line and
[10:11] this nasty vulgar thought came into his
[10:13] mind and the prayer line is he's there
[10:15] in the prayer line praying for people
[10:16] with brother brandham and he goes to
[10:18] brother Bram and he repents and he
[10:19] apologizes said this horrible thought
[10:21] came in my mind please forgive me and he
[10:23] said brother that was meant for me that
[10:25] the devil trying to project that thought
[10:26] and give you thought so it's not the
[10:28] thinking or the seeing that's wrong but
[10:30] it's the subsequent contemplation of it
[10:33] to where you it says to lust after her
[10:36] in his heart yeah so it's that to desire
[10:39] and to covet
[10:41] after and and it's speaking to just how
[10:44] dangerous the eyesight is and what it
[10:46] may do to one's mind Proverbs 27:20 hell
[10:50] and destruction are Never full so the
[10:53] eyes of man are never satisfied his eyes
[10:56] will never have its F and when it says
[10:59] the eyes of men are never satisfied
[11:01] again it's not the Optics but it's the
[11:03] whole process of seeing something and
[11:05] then apprehending it entertaining it
[11:07] mulling over it imagining it having
[11:10] affections towards it being conscious of
[11:12] it in the mind the eye in the scriptures
[11:16] both the emotional and mental
[11:19] faculties I want to make this point the
[11:21] eye the lust of the eye is both
[11:23] emotional and
[11:25] intellectual good whatever Scarlet
[11:28] Letter we would put on intellectualism
[11:30] the same is on
[11:32] emotionalism the The Scarlet Letter
[11:34] you'd put on fundamental P
[11:36] fundamentalism alone to where it's only
[11:38] fundamentalism the same Scarlet Letter
[11:40] is on Charisma and fanaticism because
[11:43] they're both lust of the eyes one is
[11:45] emotional one is intellectual but
[11:47] they're both
[11:49] only in the spirit of man in his
[11:53] emotions or in his intellect and just as
[11:55] the lust of the flesh relates to the
[11:57] body and the S the the physical senses
[12:00] the lust of the eye relates to the
[12:01] spirit of a man and his mental faculties
[12:04] and those senses of his spirit that can
[12:05] both be intellectual and even the Bible
[12:08] says having itching ears because
[12:10] intellectualism can be stimulating and
[12:12] that's what some people enjoy but then
[12:14] for others based upon a lot of different
[12:16] factors can enjoy more emotionalism and
[12:18] body bodily exercise and it may be that
[12:21] you can line up certain quotes to
[12:23] castigate the intellectuals and you can
[12:24] line up a bunch of quotes to castigate
[12:26] the emotionalism but at the end of the
[12:28] day that Let them fight it out you stay
[12:31] right in the middle of God's word faith
[12:34] in God's word the word and the word
[12:36] only in Matthew chap 6: 21-
[12:40] 24 as the eye is Never Satisfied the
[12:44] eyes of man are never filled up that
[12:45] means it's a gate that's constantly
[12:47] Desiring and hungering and
[12:49] lusting it says in verse 21 to 24 for
[12:52] where your treasure is there will your
[12:54] heart be also and then he immediately
[12:56] says the light of the body is the eye if
[12:59] therefore thine eye be single thy whole
[13:01] body shall be full of light there's this
[13:03] this your your mind your this these
[13:06] faculties of the spirit the light of the
[13:08] body is the eye this eye being a Gateway
[13:10] brother bandam alludes to how it's as if
[13:13] the physical eyesight governs all these
[13:15] other senses of imagination affections
[13:17] conscience memory and reasoning how that
[13:19] that sense you see things before you can
[13:21] smell it you'll see things before you
[13:22] hear it you'll see things uh before you
[13:25] taste it how it it becomes this
[13:26] governing force on all things if your
[13:29] eye is single the body is going to be
[13:31] full of light now I'm not going to break
[13:33] this down into great depth but I want to
[13:35] just point out how important this eye is
[13:38] but if thine eye be evil the whole body
[13:40] shall be full of Darkness an evil eye
[13:42] will ultimately corrupt it's causing you
[13:44] to be full of Darkness if therefore the
[13:46] light that is in thee be Darkness how
[13:48] great is that Darkness your
[13:49] misperception you're calling something
[13:52] right but when it's wrong that's the
[13:54] greatest Darkness if the light the
[13:57] understanding your reasoning your
[13:58] affection your imagination actually be
[14:00] Darkness if you're able to justify your
[14:02] intellectualism or Justify Your
[14:04] emotionalism and and you say that this
[14:06] is the way that it ought to be or this
[14:08] is the truth that's the greatest
[14:10] Darkness he says no man can serve two
[14:12] masters for either he will hate the one
[14:14] and love the other or else he'll hold to
[14:16] the one and despise the other you cannot
[14:18] serve God in Mammon so all those things
[14:21] that are Mammon are Mammon and you can't
[14:23] if you hold to one and you love that one
[14:25] and you give one preeminence and you
[14:26] make one your master then you'll hate
[14:28] the other one
[14:30] and and and you you'll just uh divide
[14:33] and be opposed so we must serve God not
[14:36] the lust of the flesh or the lust of the
[14:38] eyes or the pride of life we must serve
[14:40] God Amen as all that is in the world is
[14:42] Mammon Mammon is lust of the flesh lust
[14:44] of the eyes and the pride of life Mammon
[14:47] is money women and
[14:49] popularity now as balum demonstrates
[14:51] money problems Samson demonstrates women
[14:55] problems and as balum showed how that
[14:58] one could be reckless in his character
[15:00] and he stays very near situation long
[15:03] enough to ultimately be influenced and
[15:05] then give counsel that causes Israel to
[15:07] stumble 23,000 something get uh uh slain
[15:11] uh we see and how that greed and money
[15:13] that Temptation was the downfall of
[15:15] balum women and the temptation of women
[15:19] be is expressed in the life of Samson of
[15:21] how that will influence an individual
[15:24] not just a man but individuals and cause
[15:27] them to stumble brother B Sister to
[15:29] Samson as he said to balam it was money
[15:31] he says to Samson it was Delilah the
[15:33] woman who woed him in her lap until he
[15:36] gave away the secrets of the Lord to her
[15:39] he says very plain a few places Samson
[15:41] fell because of
[15:43] women in the sermon the unfailing
[15:45] realities of the Living God he said
[15:46] Samson was a lot like our leaders today
[15:48] a ladies man chasing around from place
[15:51] to place after women like a lot of our
[15:54] leaders today like a lot of our
[15:56] compromisers on the word let a and lead
[15:59] them no doubt this quote was relevant
[16:03] with Trump in office but you go all the
[16:05] way back to Kennedy and you look at
[16:06] different leaders and you see the
[16:08] different ones who are leading and their
[16:09] personalities and and I know maybe we
[16:12] just like to point out the clintons and
[16:13] the kennedies and the and the different
[16:16] ones but we finally got our Republican
[16:18] who was a ladies man who multiple wives
[16:20] and things but Samson is a was a ladies
[16:24] man chasing around from place to place
[16:26] after women he says this is like
[16:28] leadership who compromise the word and
[16:30] let women lead them now jot it down take
[16:34] some notes in the margin because just as
[16:36] we tried to show in the word of God how
[16:38] that money was just not being rich or
[16:41] lusting to be rich but has a lot of
[16:43] other applications to the lust of the
[16:44] flesh the same will be so about women
[16:47] and just as uh the lust of the flesh has
[16:49] application in the spiritual religious
[16:51] realm so does
[16:53] women Judges chapter 16 verse1 we
[16:56] started in chapter 16 and this chapter
[16:59] starts with this statement then went
[17:01] Samson to Gaza and saw there a harlot
[17:04] and went in un her this is a pattern in
[17:07] Samson's life as it says that he went to
[17:10] Gaza and saw a harlot he goes in under
[17:13] so now he's going to have a relationship
[17:15] with this uh adulterous woman or this
[17:17] fornicating woman this woman of ill
[17:20] repute and he's demonstrating something
[17:22] that he always this was something he
[17:24] always did as we read as we'll read in
[17:27] this a little bit later God anoint
[17:29] Samson and he does great Miracles and he
[17:31] does Supernatural acts he's gone to Gaza
[17:35] he he has this in his heart he has a a
[17:37] character that is reckless or perverse
[17:39] he's laying with this Harlot but yet
[17:40] then God immediately will perform and
[17:43] manifest himself in very great ways in
[17:46] Samson's life but he has a weakness as
[17:49] you look at it becomes the bookend to
[17:51] almost every miracle that God manifest
[17:54] himself and we could tell the stories of
[17:56] this great power but then you could see
[17:57] something happens before and something
[17:59] happened after something happens after
[18:01] and though no matter what happens in the
[18:03] middle ultimately we realize that
[18:04] Samson's driven by one thing he can list
[18:07] a lot of outstanding Miracles he can
[18:08] list a lot of outstanding moves he can
[18:10] list a lot of things that happened that
[18:12] people could witness and the great
[18:13] exploits and manifestations and
[18:15] strengths that were absolutely
[18:18] Supernatural acts of God as the spirit
[18:20] of God anointed Samson's flesh that's
[18:22] right but yet he had a weakness good
[18:26] Judges chapter 14 ver1 and Samson went
[18:28] down to Timnath and saw a woman in
[18:30] Timnath of the daughters of the
[18:33] Philistines judges 16:4 and it came to
[18:37] pass after that he loved a woman in the
[18:39] valley of SAR whose name was
[18:43] Delilah Samson's story just covers a few
[18:46] chapters but yet there's a few women
[18:48] already and in every instance his
[18:50] interaction with these women again I
[18:53] want you to really focus on how that
[18:55] when we say money women in popularity we
[18:57] think oh you just lust for money you
[18:59] know hit me up on cash app and Zell me
[19:02] something hit give me some vimmo money
[19:04] money money money money you want it you
[19:05] want the the the gas the Moola right we
[19:08] want some scratch those are also maybe
[19:10] some connection hints and there's things
[19:12] that you want you want to get it you
[19:13] want to have it and it's not always just
[19:17] that H there's there's problems that
[19:20] come with money there's things that that
[19:22] are perverse and Reckless and it
[19:24] manifest in a lot of other ways so if we
[19:26] can say this way it's the lust of the
[19:27] flesh which is is demonstrated by greed
[19:30] or by money and then here the lust of
[19:32] the eyes is going to be demonstrated in
[19:34] this uh gender if we can put it that way
[19:37] or in this type or in the woman and in
[19:40] every single instance where Samson deals
[19:43] with the woman there's deceit or some
[19:45] sort of Heartache when dealing with them
[19:48] there's some sort of trap there's some
[19:50] sort of setup there's some sort of
[19:51] difficulty he goes into Gaza and this
[19:53] happens he goes this and this happens
[19:55] and so there was something that he might
[19:57] have realized man every time I put
[19:59] myself in this situation this is
[20:01] happening but like balum the lesson is
[20:04] never
[20:05] learned there's no progress in Samson's
[20:09] life where he says man you know and
[20:11] we're only told of a few instances you
[20:12] don't know how many other times it might
[20:14] have happened where we could have
[20:15] finally been like by the time we get to
[20:16] chapter 16 he's like uh nah uhuh I've
[20:20] learned my
[20:21] lesson but it's there's no progress or
[20:24] growth because of
[20:27] weakness and make this very personal for
[20:30] us as individuals as Believers and the
[20:32] sermon Christ has revealed in his own
[20:34] word he says I was just talking to a
[20:36] young Minister and his wife in the room
[20:37] just a few moments ago and both of them
[20:39] are nervous just like the rest of the
[20:41] world the rest of human beings on Earth
[20:43] says I said remember Satan's got a Punch
[20:46] coming at you I don't care who you are
[20:49] he's got a right for that one punch
[20:52] which had you rather it be that punch
[20:55] maybe the nervousness that they had be
[20:57] blind or be arth CRI sitting in a chair
[20:59] or be
[21:00] nervous
[21:02] and I'll let the prophet ask that
[21:04] question I don't know if we want to
[21:05] engage in a wood you rather on this
[21:08] because in my mind I'm thinking how
[21:10] about we just don't box you know you
[21:12] know how about how about we don't have
[21:15] any punch but here he's saying what
[21:17] would you rather have and we might say
[21:18] I'd rather have this and I'd rather have
[21:20] that and I guess if you've got one and
[21:22] you know what it is just be grateful you
[21:24] know what it is instead of wanting
[21:26] somebody else's but he says he's got
[21:28] somewhere he can punch you so for all of
[21:29] us young and old every single one of us
[21:31] here even as we begin to develop and
[21:33] grow there's a punch that he can have at
[21:36] us that there's something that he can
[21:38] begin to angle and he's watching our
[21:40] lives he realizes just how you were
[21:42] raised and things that happened to you
[21:43] and circumstances and situations begins
[21:45] to say oh he's got a little bit of a
[21:47] complex there oh he's got this
[21:49] sensitivity oh this happened and so
[21:51] there's a way that he tries to have this
[21:53] punch he's got a punch he's got a right
[21:55] to that open space
[21:58] so there's maybe this vulnerability
[22:00] there's this weakness he says now that's
[22:02] the spot you got to keep covered all the
[22:04] time so we should never use the fact
[22:07] that we're vulnerable to a hook to get
[22:10] knocked out by a
[22:12] hook that there's no reason to say well
[22:15] you know I just I I just I can't keep my
[22:16] hands up I'm vulnerable to the jab
[22:18] there's no
[22:20] excuse keep it covered up watch for it
[22:24] it's not if you if you get knocked out
[22:26] you can't say well you had one punch
[22:27] coming said you've trained for this over
[22:30] and over and over again he said this is
[22:32] what he does he'll do two to the body
[22:34] then he's coming with the left hook and
[22:35] you've got to know to avoid
[22:38] it he's got a Punch coming so keep it
[22:41] covered at all time you got to keep your
[22:42] hands up you got to keep your guard up
[22:45] you say well my punch is my punch is
[22:47] this my punch is that I'm vulnerable to
[22:48] this keep it
[22:50] guarded what if if you have one that's
[22:52] more pronounced in your life of this big
[22:54] three and and you want to narrow it down
[22:56] I know just exactly what my problem is I
[22:58] know EX ly what my lust is keep it
[23:00] guarded
[23:02] amen and stay covered by the blood walk
[23:05] in the light as he is in the light amen
[23:09] now in Judges chapter 14 veres 1
[23:12] to3 we'll read a little bit more about
[23:16] Samson's pattern as we saw that he went
[23:18] to Gaza and slept with a harlot and then
[23:19] he sees this woman in Tim math in the
[23:22] beginning and then he loves Delilah and
[23:23] we see these women in his life and just
[23:26] these three and again maybe he called
[23:28] them his big three and that's why they
[23:29] get memorialized in judges 14 or judges
[23:33] it says and Samson went down to Timnath
[23:35] and saw a woman in Timnath of the
[23:36] daughters of the Philistines and he came
[23:39] up and told his father and his mother
[23:40] and said I have seen a woman in tinth of
[23:45] the daughters of the pH Philistines now
[23:47] therefore get her for me to
[23:50] wife this
[23:52] is we we'll see it as we keep reading
[23:54] but this is like almost like love at
[23:56] first sight he Caesar this is the lust
[24:00] of the eyes that's where it begins to
[24:02] work then his father and his mother said
[24:05] unto him if there is there never a woman
[24:08] among the daughters of thy Brethren or
[24:09] among all thy people that thou goest to
[24:11] take her wife uh goest to take a wife of
[24:14] the uncircumcised
[24:16] Philistines now let's just play a little
[24:18] Blues Clues here let's figure it out
[24:21] gold bug here we've got a mystery let's
[24:24] see if we can see any uh
[24:26] evidence is there never a woman among
[24:29] the
[24:30] Israelites what does that tell you this
[24:33] could have been big
[24:34] 33 there's something about these
[24:36] Philistine women is is there ever going
[24:38] to be a daughter among the Israelites
[24:40] that you'll like is there never going to
[24:42] be a woman that's a believer that you
[24:44] like he says but you'll go and take the
[24:45] wife of an uncircumcised
[24:48] Philistine now I will say this that the
[24:50] parents didn't know what was in his
[24:51] heart and the Bible says that it was in
[24:53] his heart to try to get back at the
[24:54] Philistines and that in itself isn't
[24:56] necessarily wrong uh and and the way
[24:59] that he was acting but yet just like
[25:00] balum we could say maybe there's
[25:02] something not totally right in his
[25:04] motive and
[25:05] objective and and I'm not I I accept
[25:07] fully what the scripture is setting
[25:09] forth there and I'm not trying to cause
[25:10] any kind of interpretation to it but he
[25:12] continues and he says this notice this
[25:15] last phrase there and Samson said unto
[25:17] his father get her for me for she
[25:20] pleaseth me
[25:21] well one translation WR she's pleasing
[25:24] to my
[25:25] eyes just almost it's not the same word
[25:28] word but it's very close to what the
[25:29] woman says about the tree that it was
[25:31] pleasant to the eyes he's saying she's
[25:33] fit for me it's purely a visual
[25:37] attraction and not just in the visual
[25:39] sense of it towards like that's a
[25:41] beautiful woman and and one could and
[25:43] even brother bradam and some places we
[25:44] remark how a woman is beautiful and
[25:46] she's pretty and it's not necessarily
[25:49] indicative of some kind of lust or some
[25:51] kind of uh foul thing but it's a for him
[25:53] it is this physical attraction this
[25:56] visually pleasing and yet it more than
[25:59] that because he says he says that she
[26:00] pleaseth me well he liked the way she
[26:03] made him feel so it's not just the eye
[26:06] but it's what it did to him the lust of
[26:07] the eyes and now he begins to feel like
[26:09] wow this is something I want get her for
[26:12] me this is the tendency of mankind to
[26:15] allow the eyes to guide him and
[26:18] therefore provoke some sort of anchoring
[26:20] or sort some sort of thought where in
[26:22] you're like man this is what this is
[26:24] what I want and it's a dynamic that
[26:27] works in our minds and even brother
[26:28] brandham said about the Catholic church
[26:30] that they figured it out these are my
[26:32] words now they figured out the lust of
[26:34] the eyes and they figured out how good
[26:36] Optics are and visual things are so
[26:38] they're capitalizing on the visual
[26:40] because it becomes a gateway to the
[26:42] spirit and anchors some value in
[26:43] someone's mind and because it looks a
[26:45] certain way they believe they want it
[26:47] they want to be a part of it they lust
[26:48] for it they like the way that it makes
[26:50] them
[26:51] feel about themselves and about whether
[26:55] or not they're doing the right thing
[26:57] it's just a tendency of man it's a bias
[27:00] that's been studied over and over again
[27:02] academically and with great scholarship
[27:05] how that what seeing something even in
[27:07] one particular instance uh they did a
[27:10] study where they took um three
[27:13] pictures one was the actual subject the
[27:17] other one was and then another one was
[27:19] that same person with their nose crooked
[27:21] and the third one was maybe a better
[27:23] looking guy and they would ask people
[27:25] rate these three most attractive to the
[27:28] Le least attractive and it was the one
[27:30] the two the one that looked very similar
[27:34] to the the ugly one with the weird
[27:36] nose and yet just but just since enough
[27:39] dis dissimilar in such a way to where
[27:41] the mind is shifted to the other one it
[27:44] says this one looks better because that
[27:45] one's so close but ugly uglier and
[27:48] disregards the one that might actually
[27:50] be better looking and so the conclusion
[27:52] the one who ran this study the
[27:53] conclusion is always hang out with your
[27:56] friend who looks a lot like you but just
[27:58] a little less goodlook maybe more ugly
[28:01] and that was the conclusion of the study
[28:03] I thought now what a waste of
[28:06] time and so that's it's just the way the
[28:09] mind works and the Eye Works in 1st
[28:11] Samuel chapter 16 I'll just tell the
[28:13] story it says that when Samuel looked on
[28:16] elab he said surely the Lord's anointing
[28:19] is before him and the Lord immediately
[28:21] rebuked Samuel 1st Samuel 166 and 7 look
[28:24] not on his countenance or on the height
[28:26] of his stature don't look on the outward
[28:29] things he says because I've refused him
[28:31] for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for
[28:34] man lookth on the outward appearance but
[28:36] the Lord lookth on the heart man sees
[28:39] externally and it pro provokes him
[28:41] internally causes him to conclude things
[28:44] and see things but God looks internally
[28:48] first even man who acts who's prompted
[28:51] internally it begins to act externally
[28:53] God looks and says now I know what's in
[28:54] your heart your way is perverse before
[28:57] me
[28:59] Samson is driven by the lust of the eyes
[29:01] and in judges 14 as you read it Samson
[29:03] marries this Philistine woman he throws
[29:06] a 7-Day Feast he invites 30 of his
[29:09] friends or companions as the Bible says
[29:12] and as you most of you know the story he
[29:13] tells a riddle based upon his own
[29:15] personal experience and he says as he
[29:18] tells this riddle that whoever can
[29:20] figure it out before the feast is over
[29:22] you got to solve it before the last the
[29:24] feast ends I I will give you 30 sheets
[29:27] and 30 changes of garment if you solve
[29:30] this riddle during the feast after 3
[29:33] days they couldn't figure it out so they
[29:36] hatch a plan now we're looking
[29:40] at woman problems
[29:43] right it says it came to pass judges 14:
[29:46] 15 to 20 I'll kind of intersperse some
[29:49] things in here uh but we're going to be
[29:51] reading to verse 20 and it came to pass
[29:52] on the seventh day and you're thinking
[29:55] time's running out but this word here
[29:57] the seventh day is the SB Sabbath day
[29:59] which would have fallen maybe on that
[30:00] third or fourth day of the seven-day
[30:04] Feast it's confusing I I'm confused when
[30:07] I read it I was like wait a minute huh
[30:08] what but on the third after three days
[30:12] they can't figure it out and on that
[30:13] Sabbath day on the seventh day to the
[30:15] Israelites they said unto Samson's wife
[30:18] entice thy husband that he may declare
[30:21] unto us the riddle entice him to declare
[30:24] unto us the riddle lest we burn the thy
[30:28] father's house with fire have you called
[30:30] us to take that we have is it not so and
[30:34] so there's this suspicion and wondering
[30:37] you know why are we here and what's
[30:38] going on and there's these threats and
[30:40] intimidations and I want to make it very
[30:43] clear as Samson his problem was women
[30:47] let's let's look at how women problems
[30:49] manifested themselves in Samson's life
[30:51] he's newly married and notice how Satan
[30:55] attacks this is look at his Mo how he
[30:57] attacks and now he's working on the
[31:00] woman working on the wife in this
[31:02] instance in 1 Peter 3: 5-7 it says for
[31:06] after this manner in the old time the
[31:07] holy women also who trusted in God
[31:10] adorned themselves being in subjection
[31:12] unto their own husbands even as Sarah
[31:15] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[31:18] daughters are ye now listen here listen
[31:22] I know I don't have the slide there but
[31:23] listen as long as you do well and are
[31:26] not afraid with any
[31:29] amazement in other words he's telling
[31:32] Daughters of God you are tempted to be
[31:36] emotional Don't Be Afraid with any
[31:39] amazement it's easier for you to get
[31:41] worked up it's easier for you to become
[31:44] scared or suspicious it's easier for you
[31:46] to act and he says Adorn yourself and be
[31:48] in subjection as long as you do well and
[31:50] are not easily provoked as long as you
[31:53] do not let your emotions get the best of
[31:54] you
[31:56] yeah I wouldn't mind okay thank you was
[31:58] like I hope maybe at least one sister
[32:00] will amen so I don't feel like I'm going
[32:02] to be the women are all going oh
[32:05] yeah okay all right we're not coming
[32:08] back for evening service like Checkmate
[32:09] we don't have
[32:13] one it says so this is such a a
[32:16] beautiful scripture holy women trusted
[32:19] in
[32:20] God and yet trusting God they could
[32:23] Adorn themselves and be subject to their
[32:25] husbands why no not because they trusted
[32:28] that Rascal right not because they were
[32:31] suspicious not because they were scared
[32:33] but they trusted God was it that they
[32:35] trusted the husband they trusted God
[32:37] therefore they could Adorn themselves
[32:38] and he says so you'll be fine as long as
[32:42] you keep doing good and aren't provoked
[32:44] or afraid with any
[32:47] amazement and he says likewise ye
[32:49] husbands dwell with them according to
[32:50] knowledge giving honor unto the wife so
[32:53] this is the ideal scenario to where the
[32:55] wife isn't trusting a reprobate or or a
[32:58] heathen the wife's not making herself
[32:59] subject to a husband who won't dwell
[33:01] with her according to the knowledge who
[33:02] won't honor her but yet she dwells with
[33:04] her own peculiarities and her own fears
[33:07] and realizing that she could be uh
[33:09] worked to be afraid with amazement but
[33:11] has a husband who will dwell with her
[33:13] according to knowledge and give her
[33:14] honor as unto the weaker
[33:18] vessel as being Hees of the grace of
[33:21] life that your prayers be not hindered a
[33:23] lot to teach there but Peter's
[33:26] acknowledging that she's the Bible says
[33:28] the weaker vessel she's more feeble
[33:32] she's more weak she has less strength so
[33:36] notice it says the weaker vessel doesn't
[33:40] say the weak
[33:41] vessel come on weak
[33:44] husbands
[33:46] right oh now you want to lay out on me
[33:50] all right don't worry sisters they're
[33:51] going to be they're going to get the
[33:52] rest of it I'm glad I I'm glad I brought
[33:55] part six
[33:57] it's saying she's the weaker doesn't say
[33:59] you're strong you're just stronger be
[34:03] careful he who standeth be careful Les
[34:05] he think he stands on his own power and
[34:07] his own strength but God I'm the man of
[34:09] this house I'm the head I'm I'm the
[34:10] discerner I can figure this out I can do
[34:12] this no no no no you've got weaknesses
[34:14] too you're subject to like passions you
[34:17] can be tempted just like anybody else oh
[34:19] it's the grace of God that keeps us oh
[34:21] man I know what I'm doing I got I know
[34:23] what I'm doing he still got W and punch
[34:25] coming
[34:28] one punch and that's not a Japanese
[34:36] cartoon giving honors unto the weaker
[34:39] vessel she's more feeble you're feeble
[34:41] but she's more feeble you're weak but
[34:43] she's more weak you might be strong but
[34:47] she's not as
[34:49] strong it's the weaker
[34:52] vessel in 1 Timothy 2:14 it says and
[34:55] Adam was not deceived but the woman
[34:57] being deceived was in the
[35:00] transgression what did Satan do he
[35:02] worked on her
[35:05] first and in working on her he works on
[35:09] the man through her it's exactly what
[35:13] these men came to uh Samson's wife and
[35:17] said entice thy husband that he may tell
[35:19] us the riddle how is he go how is Samson
[35:22] going to tell them through the mediator
[35:25] through the actor of the white
[35:29] she was going to become the one that he
[35:30] would tell his secrets to them through
[35:33] her so the man they Satan worked on the
[35:36] woman to get to the man and Genesis 3:6
[35:39] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[35:41] good for food and pleasant to the eyes
[35:42] and a tree to be desired to make one
[35:43] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[35:45] did eat and what does it say and gave
[35:47] also unto her husband with her and he
[35:49] did
[35:51] eat in this instance as we see there in
[35:54] the garden it's the woman who first then
[35:56] is influen uence and then the goal is
[35:59] now to bring it to the man to get to the
[36:02] man that he must also act and we know
[36:04] that Adam was not deceived but the woman
[36:06] was deceived and in her deceit in being
[36:08] in transgression she brings it to the
[36:10] Man and it doesn't say Adam was deceived
[36:12] but Adam nevertheless
[36:15] acted so here in Samson's life in judges
[36:18] 14 we see that the woman is working on
[36:20] him she's going after
[36:22] him or they're going after the woman so
[36:26] that she'll go after him
[36:28] now think about what Samson is teaching
[36:31] us about the lust of the eyes what is
[36:35] Samson teaching us about women that's
[36:39] not just informative to a minister
[36:41] that's not just instructive to a young
[36:43] evangelist that's not just related to to
[36:45] preachers but is also instructive to all
[36:47] of us as individuals to us as we run our
[36:50] families and also to a
[36:52] church how can a woman be a
[36:55] problem this is the image that brother
[36:57] Adam points out and I would encourage
[36:58] you maybe to go listen to Paradox but
[37:00] mostly maybe just once more and the once
[37:02] more sermons he preaches he's dealing
[37:04] specifically with Samson he says it's a
[37:06] picture of a demoralized he's talking
[37:08] about Samson in judges 16 it's a picture
[37:11] of a demoralized sunken generation it's
[37:14] a picture of a Nation that's lost its
[37:16] hold with God When a Man Loves money he
[37:20] loses God When a Man Loves women he
[37:23] loses God it's a picture of a church
[37:25] that's lost its hold on God's word cuz
[37:28] that's what Samson represented here
[37:31] Samson represents what happens when man
[37:34] lets go of the full word of
[37:37] God he said this symbol represents the
[37:40] very hour we're living in now the
[37:42] condition of the church now broken out
[37:45] of the word of the Lord humiliated out
[37:47] of its place yeah Samson as a man
[37:50] represents the woman the church out of
[37:52] its place Samson though he's a man he's
[37:54] influenced by the woman and he
[37:56] represents a moralized Nation a sunken
[37:59] generation a a a nation that's lost its
[38:01] hold on the word of God the picture of a
[38:03] church that's lost its hold on the word
[38:05] of God it symbolizes the hour we're
[38:07] living in where the church has kicked
[38:09] out Christ the word and gone after
[38:13] intellectualism or
[38:16] emotionalism
[38:17] humiliated out of its place in bondage I
[38:21] say to the lust of the Flesh and the
[38:24] lust of the
[38:26] eyes now is the woman let's keep reading
[38:29] I know that we're nearing our time here
[38:32] I know maybe it might feel a little bit
[38:33] warm but it is hot
[38:35] outside Judges chapter 14:1 15 I think
[38:38] they had it there start with verse 16
[38:40] and Samson's wife wept before him I'll
[38:42] go ahead and just read this and then go
[38:44] back so we can maybe save some time
[38:47] Samson's wife wept before him and said
[38:49] thou DST but hate me and lovest me not
[38:52] thou Hast put forth a riddle under the
[38:54] children of my people and Hast not told
[38:56] it me
[38:58] if you really love me I guess you don't
[39:01] love me you shouldn't have married me
[39:05] and that just I man all the language
[39:07] that that can be used here and he said
[39:09] unto her behold I have not told it to my
[39:11] father nor my mother and shall I tell it
[39:13] thee he's kind of caught by surprise I
[39:15] mean this is a riddle I don't want I
[39:17] don't want to be shelling out you know
[39:19] 60 60 pieces of gifts here and garments
[39:22] and clothing and different things I I
[39:24] don't want to tell the
[39:26] riddle and she wept before him the seven
[39:29] days while their feast lasted and it
[39:31] came to pass on the seventh day I know
[39:33] maybe there's some types we could bring
[39:34] out here that he told her because she
[39:37] lay sore upon
[39:43] Him Samson had a problem with
[39:47] women come on
[39:49] somebody what does the woman do vexing
[39:53] him laying sore upon him working on his
[39:56] emotions
[39:57] saying well if you really loved me you
[39:59] wouldn't keep this secret from me right
[40:02] and
[40:04] it I mean I I I know maybe on his face
[40:07] it seems Petty but there's more going on
[40:09] here and the men of the city and and he
[40:12] she told the riddle and so it says that
[40:15] um and she told the riddle of the
[40:17] children of her
[40:18] people and the men of the city said unto
[40:20] him on the seven days so he gave
[40:23] in and he to it says that he told her
[40:26] because she laid s upon him and then she
[40:27] told the children of her people it's a
[40:29] key phrase she told the children of her
[40:31] people and the men of the city said unto
[40:32] him on the seventh day before the sun
[40:34] went down they waited the very very last
[40:36] moment what is sweeter than honey and
[40:38] what is stronger than a lion he and what
[40:42] is sweeter than honey and what is
[40:43] stronger than a lion
[40:45] boom and he said unto them this is one
[40:48] of those great statements if he had not
[40:50] plowed with my heer you had not found
[40:53] out my
[40:54] riddle let's not let's not use Samson
[40:57] words but if you had not plowed with my
[41:00] heer you had not found out my riddle and
[41:01] the spirit of the Lord came upon him and
[41:03] he went down to ashalon and slew 30 men
[41:05] of them and took their spoil and gave a
[41:07] change of garments unto them which
[41:08] expounded the riddle so he was going to
[41:10] pay but he was going to make them pay
[41:11] for it and his anger was kindled notice
[41:13] and he went unto his father's house but
[41:15] Samson's wife was given to His companion
[41:18] whom he had used as his
[41:19] friend if we just took this and looked
[41:22] at it very quickly as a whole the woman
[41:24] was able to manipulate the world's
[41:26] strongest
[41:29] man and the woman's manipulation of
[41:32] Samson and this weakness that we could
[41:33] try to gather from judges 14 will you
[41:35] ever find an Israelite girl we could say
[41:37] that this was a problem that he had but
[41:40] now the Bible tells us this story and
[41:42] maybe we're just surmising a little bit
[41:43] or conjecture there but at least in this
[41:45] story he sees the woman he really wants
[41:47] her he he gets her he marries her and
[41:50] this woman his wife is able to
[41:52] manipulate what we think is the World's
[41:54] Strongest Man and this becomes a great
[41:56] weakness weak
[41:58] nness and the men of the city the
[42:00] children of her people used his wife the
[42:03] woman this woman that was now joined
[42:06] with him he uses the phrase if you had
[42:09] not plowed with my heer a heer is a
[42:13] young female calf and so he says this in
[42:16] a way to indicate this is my heer this
[42:20] is my wife I'm joined to her but he's
[42:22] pointed out that she's also
[42:24] young she she doesn't quite fully
[42:27] understand the Loyalty that a wife
[42:28] should have to her husband she hasn't
[42:30] fully separated maybe from the ties that
[42:33] she has to her family or her people or
[42:35] where she's from the church she used to
[42:37] go to the things she's familiar with so
[42:39] there's a little bit of vulnerability to
[42:41] family influence to Regional influence
[42:43] as a vulnerability to the threat that
[42:45] was
[42:46] made and so in her Youth and her
[42:49] weakness she's not learned her her where
[42:51] her loyalties lie and where they're due
[42:53] she has not learned to honor her head
[42:56] not her house her household where she's
[42:59] from so he says had you not plowed in
[43:01] other words he used they used
[43:03] her and I read in different places where
[43:07] different men said there's no need to
[43:09] expound upon this it's evident on its
[43:11] face what he means but he used her they
[43:15] used her to dig in his heart to discover
[43:17] his Secrets plowed it up dug it
[43:20] out and and and she had to
[43:23] dig right she had to lay sore upon him
[43:26] yeah had to get past maybe his initial
[43:28] objections and and pray upon the
[43:30] vulnerability even of a young husband
[43:32] who wants to demonstrate his love for
[43:33] his wife who doesn't like to be
[43:35] questioned who who tells her thinking oh
[43:37] maybe this is something I need to learn
[43:39] at my age to be able to try I didn't
[43:40] tell my mother or father but we're one
[43:42] now and so whatever my secrets are your
[43:44] secrets and so what does he do he tells
[43:46] her and her infidelity her betrayal
[43:50] becomes a wound to
[43:52] Samson perhaps a motivating scar
[43:54] throughout his life
[43:57] you notice that this kind of dynamic and
[43:59] this marriage caused a separation
[44:01] between Samson and his wife caused a
[44:03] division it says that Samson went to be
[44:05] with his father in his
[44:08] house and this is how a woman can be a
[44:14] Temptation I don't mean to keep doing
[44:20] this I mean it's uh
[44:25] it's you may not like it but it's in the
[44:28] Bible Samson demonstrates how a woman
[44:31] can be a problem and we're learning from
[44:33] his
[44:34] life and and maybe not so that we would
[44:37] say as men a certain things or as women
[44:40] say a certain things but just whoever we
[44:42] are we could
[44:43] learn very next chapter in judges 15
[44:46] veres 1 to2 it came to pass within a
[44:48] while after in the time of wheat Harvest
[44:50] that Samson visited his wife with a kid
[44:53] read this as a goat
[44:58] right he didn't just come with the child
[44:59] and say behold I have gotten you a baby
[45:02] he showed up with the goat during this
[45:04] Harvest he's wanting to bring peace he's
[45:06] offering some sort of reconciliation
[45:08] here's the dowy that was late the Samson
[45:10] visited his wife with the kid and he
[45:11] said I will go into my wife into the
[45:13] chamber so he's wanting to be a husband
[45:14] he's wanting things to be restored but
[45:16] the father would not suffer him to go in
[45:19] and the father said I verily thought
[45:21] that thou had us utterly hated her
[45:23] therefore I gave her to thy companion is
[45:25] not her younger sister fairer than
[45:27] she take her I pray thee instead of her
[45:31] in-law
[45:33] interference right this is how a woman
[45:36] can be a problem to a man this is how a
[45:39] a a woman can be a problem in churches
[45:41] right when sister churches interfere
[45:43] with other churches listen there's a lot
[45:44] of way we ways we could break this down
[45:47] but the story of Samson shows us just
[45:49] how messy these Dynamics can be when
[45:51] boundaries are not respected and when
[45:54] family gets involved and feelings get
[45:56] involved and head ship's not honored in
[45:57] the word doesn't have the first place
[46:00] amen and it shows us that maybe even to
[46:02] Samson it wasn't necessary that he found
[46:04] the woman beautiful and she was the most
[46:06] beautiful but he lusted for and desired
[46:07] her so much and maybe she wasn't
[46:09] necessarily pretty because and so what
[46:12] it does is it tells me that the lust of
[46:14] the eyes was a draw on his heart yeah he
[46:16] wanted to be with her but Samson there's
[46:18] prettier women and Samson there's women
[46:20] that are Israelites is like no but this
[46:22] one man I want
[46:24] her and maybe the dad is showing us that
[46:27] he knew Samson's
[46:29] weakness so he offers his
[46:32] daughter to
[46:34] him as the as they accused the wife of
[46:36] tinth the daughter of the Philistines
[46:38] well isn't that why we're all here
[46:40] Samson's going to destroy us and he's
[46:41] going to cause problems and we'll burn
[46:43] your house down if you don't help us
[46:44] solve this riddle and they threatened
[46:46] her and used the woman to get to the man
[46:47] now they're still thinking we need to
[46:49] make Samson happy especially after the
[46:51] fact that he stripped all the clothes
[46:53] off of 30 men to to fulfill half his bet
[46:58] and he offers his daughter like this
[47:01] this will get Samson right like Samson
[47:02] will take the prettier
[47:04] one and maybe it speaks to the fact that
[47:06] Samson's driven by something more than
[47:08] just what's the lust of the flesh but
[47:11] it's also the lust of the
[47:13] eyes if you continue to read these are
[47:15] the stories we're most familiar with
[47:17] that in his anger Samson uses foxes and
[47:19] then a Jawbone of a dead donkey to
[47:22] harass through the foxes and then kill
[47:25] Philistines a thousand with the Jawbone
[47:28] of an
[47:29] ass once again the
[47:33] pattern of the woman power woman
[47:38] power but it's always ending up again
[47:41] with the
[47:42] woman so in Judges chapter 16 veres
[47:47] 1-6 please do your best just to focus
[47:50] and and help me through this I want to
[47:51] finish I hate to leave the story of
[47:54] Samson hanging here then when Samson to
[47:57] Gaz and saw there a harlot and went in
[47:59] unto her and it was told the gazit some
[48:02] saying Samson has come hither and they
[48:05] compassed him in and laid wait for him
[48:07] all night in the gate of the city and
[48:09] were quiet all night saying in the
[48:11] morning when it's day we shall kill him
[48:13] why is Samson in this predicament well
[48:16] it starts with the Harlot in verse
[48:18] one once again the woman is the problem
[48:22] in judges 15 it wasn't the kid it wasn't
[48:24] the goat it was the woman
[48:27] judges 14 it's not the riddle it's the
[48:30] woman and he says and Samson laid till
[48:33] midnight and arose at midnight and took
[48:35] the doors of the Gate of the city and
[48:36] the two post and went away with them bar
[48:39] and all and put them on his shoulders
[48:40] and carried them up to the top of a hill
[48:42] that is before
[48:44] Hein you following What's Happening Here
[48:46] sees the Harlot led him to commit
[48:48] fornication puts him in a vulnerable
[48:50] spot yet the spirit of the Lord comes on
[48:52] him he manifests the power of God and
[48:55] it's kind of a rebuke to the enemy
[48:57] but it's a woman that got him
[49:00] there and the power of God seems to keep
[49:02] bailing him out doesn't it maybe there's
[49:05] some uh trust that he's starting to give
[49:07] to
[49:09] where I can get away with anything
[49:12] good I we're the bride we're Invincible
[49:15] yeah we're going to write another book
[49:17] of Acts good so let's let's just let's
[49:20] just not use a Ghost Rider anymore let's
[49:22] not let the Holy Spirit write it bless
[49:24] God I can write this chapter
[49:27] let me do
[49:28] it and begins to write his story and
[49:31] keeps getting in trouble and God keeps
[49:32] bailing him out I say that to say that
[49:35] perhaps there's this callousness that
[49:36] begins develop in Samson's heart where
[49:38] he feels like the spirit of the Lord
[49:40] will always fall the spirit of the Lord
[49:42] will always do these things and as long
[49:45] as he's doing it we can tell ourselves
[49:47] we're okay wow right tell ourselves
[49:49] we're okay no matter what we emphasize
[49:51] no matter what we how we live how we act
[49:53] what we say what we do good
[49:57] verse four it came to pass afterward
[49:59] that he loved a woman in the valley of
[50:01] Sak whose name was
[50:03] Delilah Delilah means
[50:05] feeble means to languish or to be
[50:07] distressed to be brought low I don't
[50:10] think it's a coincidence that in the
[50:11] example of Samson and especially in the
[50:13] way that brother brandham emphasizes it
[50:15] that Delilah takes on the very name of a
[50:17] weaker vessel
[50:19] yeah more
[50:21] feeble he loves a woman in the valley of
[50:24] C whose name was delil and the Lords of
[50:25] the Philistines came up unto her and
[50:27] said unto her entice him wait this is
[50:31] the same story yeah it's happening all
[50:34] over again did we choose our own
[50:35] adventure and end up back at the same
[50:37] spot what happened entice him and see
[50:39] where in his great strength lith and by
[50:41] what means we may prevail against him
[50:44] they weren't they weren't doing a study
[50:46] just find out why he's so strong we're
[50:47] we're kind of interested in seeing if we
[50:48] can't come up with our own Toxin and
[50:50] concoction and see if we can't be strong
[50:53] also but they wanted to take his
[50:54] strength away so they could Prevail
[50:56] against him that we may bind him to
[50:58] afflict him and we will give the every
[51:01] one of us 1,00 pieces of silver I don't
[51:04] know if we have enough to do the math
[51:05] but that's a lot every one of them will
[51:08] give 1100 pieces of
[51:10] silver we know how D acts so can we
[51:12] guess maybe what her weakness was lust
[51:15] of the flesh maybe it was
[51:18] money now the question at this moment is
[51:21] has Samson learned his
[51:23] lesson has he woke up from the stuper of
[51:28] the lust of the eyes this intoxicating
[51:31] effect that the flesh has upon him the
[51:34] however he wants to say well it's my
[51:35] ADHD and it's my this and my
[51:38] restlessness and this and whatever it is
[51:39] that causes him to engage in it is there
[51:41] a point at which he begins to say I need
[51:44] to
[51:45] change I need to wake up to this
[51:47] weakness I need to wake up to this
[51:49] problem I need to start taking this one
[51:51] punch
[51:52] seriously amen but in Samson we see
[51:55] again how Temptation leads to death how
[51:59] that for BA balam it started as a deed
[52:01] but then it became the standard the
[52:03] unbelling way unb way it starts as a
[52:05] feeling but giving into the feelings we
[52:07] now got to justify what we do when we
[52:08] act on our feelings deed Doctrine then
[52:12] death good crowned in
[52:16] death and Samson we see the example how
[52:18] it starts as a deed then it becomes a
[52:20] lifestyle becomes a doctor and he begins
[52:22] to justify it immediately after getting
[52:24] Boxed In With This Heart Harlot he shows
[52:27] the great power of God and the Bible
[52:28] just says and it came to pass after that
[52:30] he loved a woman Delilah we know that
[52:32] there's passages in judges where many
[52:34] years go by and and and he's he judged
[52:37] for so many years and we don't know all
[52:38] the intervening stories but could it be
[52:40] that by this point we could say that
[52:42] Samson thought I this is me this is who
[52:45] I am I don't need to
[52:48] change but after these men worked on the
[52:51] woman right this is how it works entice
[52:54] him goes to the woman entices him puts
[52:56] thoughts in her mind works on her
[52:57] threatens her tries to encour or TI her
[53:00] they use threats with the first wife
[53:02] we're going to burn your city what was
[53:04] she she was provoked to that amazement
[53:07] she was provoked to that fear with
[53:10] amazement now this one and so maybe it's
[53:12] a pride of life or L however you'd want
[53:14] to say his first wife struggled with it
[53:15] but now with Delilah it's like we're
[53:17] going to pay you a lot of money and
[53:18] she's like
[53:21] okay in in verse six and Delilah said to
[53:24] Samson tell me I pray thee
[53:27] wherein thy great strength lith and
[53:29] wherewith thou mightest be bound to
[53:31] afflict
[53:32] Thee I know that you know they say that
[53:35] brother Bram tells the story how that
[53:36] they an artist depicted Eve in the
[53:39] beginning as an ugly woman and brother
[53:42] Bram says know she was the most
[53:43] beautiful woman in all the world said
[53:45] that when Adam saw her it left it struck
[53:49] Adam caus this Mark that still
[53:52] reverberates in men
[53:54] today that's how strong it was was and
[53:57] so I suspect that Delilah probably was a
[54:00] beautiful woman and her voice probably
[54:02] wasn't tell me I pray thee he's like
[54:05] just stop talking but I imagine she knew
[54:08] just how to work
[54:09] it and so she comes and you know where's
[54:12] your strength
[54:14] lith that I that that how can you be
[54:17] bound to be weak to be afflicted and in
[54:20] verses seven and 8 what did he say well
[54:21] bind me with seven green
[54:24] ropes and she
[54:29] and the Philistines show up and I don't
[54:31] know if Samson's like wait what what is
[54:34] this what is this I I I mean I you would
[54:37] think that he'd be like 1 2 3 four 5 six
[54:39] seven Philistines wait a minute that's
[54:41] exactly green ropes this is exactly what
[54:43] I told my
[54:44] Delilah but verse 10 because he prevails
[54:48] right he breaks them Delilah said to S
[54:50] behold thou has mocked me and told me
[54:52] lies whoa
[54:54] whoa hold on here
[54:57] honey you're getting on me for lying to
[55:00] you but I think I was pretty smart to
[55:02] lie because guess who was bound by seven
[55:04] green ropes the next
[55:06] day right guess who showed up the next
[55:10] day but no you know she's the
[55:14] victim right you've lied to me I tried
[55:18] to kill you and you lied to me you're an
[55:21] evil
[55:24] man so what does he do
[55:27] he goes back to his father right he
[55:30] leaves but complex is
[55:32] scars he says well you have to use
[55:35] unused new
[55:38] ropes she doesn't the Philistines show
[55:43] up the Bible doesn't tell if this if
[55:45] there's an argument if Samson's like why
[55:47] did you do this to me why did you do
[55:49] this to me and maybe he does but you
[55:51] know what her response is in verse 13
[55:53] hither to thou has mocked me and told me
[55:55] lies
[55:56] right why did you do this why did you
[55:58] try to get me killed well you've lied to
[56:00] me I was justified in doing it because
[56:02] you're a
[56:04] liar tell me where thou mightest be
[56:06] bound and he said unto her if thou
[56:08] weaves the Seven Locks of my head with
[56:10] the web anybody want to guess what
[56:13] happens somehow someway his Seven Locks
[56:16] get woven with the web and the
[56:19] Philistines are upon
[56:20] him and each time these three times to
[56:23] Samson that should have been the big
[56:24] three right like hey get a clue pal but
[56:28] no he just plows right through the
[56:29] warning and goes right on to the fourth
[56:32] time and now we're we're we're almost
[56:33] done here so this is where it starts
[56:36] getting really really heavy and she said
[56:38] un them how can you say that you love
[56:41] me when your heart's not with
[56:45] me you've mocked me three times the
[56:49] whole picture's Chang you want to know
[56:51] the devil knows how to work on a man
[56:53] right knows how to work in this a with
[56:56] amazement the Tendencies the woman the
[56:58] weaker vessel and I and I'm saying this
[57:00] respectfully and not necessarily calling
[57:02] Out Sisters but the the way and we'll
[57:04] get into this later Satan's designed the
[57:07] woman he's her designer that's why we
[57:10] need the Holy
[57:11] Ghost and this is how the woman the
[57:14] Bible says it you'd be better to be
[57:15] homeless you'd better be living in a
[57:17] homeless shelter on a street corner in
[57:18] the corner of a house than to live in a
[57:20] mansion with the woman who lays sore
[57:22] upon you right the Bible acknowledges
[57:25] the way of a woman with a man and how he
[57:28] can press her press him she can press
[57:31] him he says you've mocked me three times
[57:33] you haven't told me were your great
[57:34] strength fire and it came to pass when
[57:37] she pressed him daily with her words and
[57:39] urged him so that his soul was vexed
[57:42] unto
[57:45] death she wore on him sore she pressed
[57:48] him she urged him how can you say you
[57:50] love me who knows what the Dynamics were
[57:52] but the Bible tells us a lot in just a
[57:54] few verses that he told her after this
[57:56] all his heart and said un her there not
[57:58] come a razor upon my head for I've been
[57:59] a Nazarite un the god from my mother's
[58:01] womb if I be shaven then my strength
[58:03] will go from me and I shall become weak
[58:05] and be like other man and when Delilah
[58:09] saw that he had told her all his heart
[58:10] she sent and called for the lord of the
[58:12] Philistines saying come up this once for
[58:14] he hath showed me all his heart then the
[58:17] Lords of the Philistines came up under
[58:18] her and brought money in their
[58:21] hand and then this picture she made him
[58:25] sleep upon her
[58:27] knees and she called for a
[58:30] man and caused him to shave off the
[58:33] Seven Locks of his
[58:35] head this is incredible
[58:38] picture
[58:40] she invites Samson to lay in her
[58:44] lap and then has a man come to shave off
[58:48] his hair quite a
[58:54] picture can you paint it
[58:56] yourself can you see how Satan
[59:00] works that even if Samson is going to be
[59:02] an image of the church today if she if
[59:04] he he's a lesson to us as the bride how
[59:07] that if we're not careful we can be
[59:09] invited to fall asleep in the lap of a
[59:12] church yes and a minister come and cut
[59:15] your hair right off wow shave off the
[59:19] Seven Locks of his head and it says and
[59:22] she began to afflict him
[59:27] maybe she began to taunt him provoke him
[59:29] just to see a little bit and his
[59:32] strength went from him and when she
[59:34] realized that Samson however she was
[59:36] agitating him and provoking him she said
[59:39] the Philistines be upon the Samson he
[59:40] woke up out of his sleep and said I will
[59:43] go out as at other times before and
[59:45] shake myself and the Bible says but he
[59:47] didn't know the Lord had departed from
[59:49] him notice the pattern in Samson's life
[59:53] he saw so many miracles he saw so many
[59:55] signs and wonders he saw God respond
[59:57] time after time again he thought you
[59:59] know what let's just keep the show going
[1:00:01] it's never going to end and he went to
[1:00:03] act out and didn't know that the bride
[1:00:05] was gone and the spirit of the Lord had
[1:00:06] departed from the face of the
[1:00:09] Earth he went to shake himself as he had
[1:00:11] before and didn't know that the Lord had
[1:00:14] departed Samson is a lesson to us of the
[1:00:17] problem of women the temptation of women
[1:00:20] the weakness of women it's a lesson that
[1:00:21] men can learn husbands can learn it's a
[1:00:23] lesson that young girls can learn it's a
[1:00:25] lesson that sisters can learn it's a
[1:00:26] lesson that we can all learn from yeah
[1:00:29] the woman woed him wore him down and
[1:00:32] then had a man come and shave
[1:00:34] him brother bham said and just once more
[1:00:36] Lord It's a Samson that's left off the
[1:00:38] principles of God's word and substituted
[1:00:41] something else and let the organization
[1:00:44] shave him down and woo him into it you
[1:00:47] don't have to be Baptist to be an
[1:00:49] organization you don't have to be
[1:00:50] Presbyterian to be an organization
[1:00:52] organization is a spirit
[1:00:54] denominationalism is a spirit if we
[1:00:56] somehow Lo ourselves to sleep to say as
[1:00:58] long as we believe brother brandom's a
[1:00:59] prophet as long as we quote from the
[1:01:01] table as long as we say that we're
[1:01:03] message or we're bride we cannot be
[1:01:05] denominated that's just simply not true
[1:01:08] because denominationalism is a spirit
[1:01:10] whether it be intellectualism
[1:01:12] emotionalism it's a spirit that will not
[1:01:14] take the full word of God that's good
[1:01:18] and organize around just a collection of
[1:01:20] quotes organize around man-made Creeds
[1:01:22] and dogmas Sam organization shave him
[1:01:25] down and woo him into it come come be a
[1:01:28] part of this come come be a part of
[1:01:33] this let me say this I I like to pick up
[1:01:35] on this on
[1:01:36] Wednesday where I hope that it's you
[1:01:40] know both genders show up on Wednesday
[1:01:42] night a woman represents anything
[1:01:45] designed by Satan to entice you or Lead
[1:01:47] You
[1:01:48] astray anything designed by Satan to
[1:01:50] bind you that's what we learned in the
[1:01:52] lesson of
[1:01:53] Samson compromise binding
[1:01:56] Temptation brother B said the word is
[1:01:58] God this is in once more the word is God
[1:02:00] that was given to his church to defeat
[1:02:02] the world and the devils and the
[1:02:04] sickness and to cast out Devils no
[1:02:06] denomination was was give to the church
[1:02:09] the word was given to the church that's
[1:02:11] her
[1:02:13] strength to defeat the world to defeat
[1:02:16] Devils to defeat sickness to cast out
[1:02:18] Devils the word is the bride's
[1:02:21] strength the word is the bride's
[1:02:23] strength to perform Miracles the word
[1:02:25] word is the reason why we can lay hands
[1:02:27] on the sick and they recover the word is
[1:02:29] why we can cast out demons the word is
[1:02:31] why limbs can be restored the word is
[1:02:33] why the dead can be raised from the
[1:02:34] grave so it's not that we emphasize the
[1:02:37] Miracles we emphasize The Miracle Worker
[1:02:40] we emphasize the one who made the
[1:02:41] promise we emphasize the presence of
[1:02:44] Jesus Christ in his bride her Revival is
[1:02:47] him amen amen we give God the glory we
[1:02:51] recognize to whom it's from and we don't
[1:02:52] begin to lull ourselves to sleep into
[1:02:54] the lap of an organiz a to eventually
[1:02:57] let our seven lock get Shor off thinking
[1:03:00] that we can just raise up and go to the
[1:03:02] next meeting that's good and it be the
[1:03:05] same
[1:03:07] amen that's her strength but they've cut
[1:03:10] this away they've cut that away they
[1:03:13] shaved off this lock and shaved off that
[1:03:15] lock until she stands shorn today like a
[1:03:19] Catholic sister Shor off until she's
[1:03:22] accepted a bunch of man-made Creeds for
[1:03:25] her Doctrine
[1:03:26] just exactly what the prophet said she
[1:03:28] would do and here she stands today
[1:03:32] humiliated you don't think that's coming
[1:03:34] to anybody who rejects the word of God
[1:03:37] you don't think that's coming for the
[1:03:38] bams and the samsons and the Sauls you
[1:03:40] don't think it's coming for those who
[1:03:42] won't take the full word of God what is
[1:03:44] brother BR showing us a church an
[1:03:46] organization or a
[1:03:47] movement is the
[1:03:50] woman this is the weakness to man this
[1:03:52] is the weakness to home this is the
[1:03:54] weakness to churches any church any
[1:03:55] organization any movement that causes
[1:03:57] you to dishonor your
[1:04:00] vow to dishonor
[1:04:03] headship his head is cut his hair he had
[1:04:06] a vow and his head is shaved he
[1:04:08] dishonors his vow he dishonors
[1:04:12] headship Brothers if you'd come to your
[1:04:14] instruments it's no surprise where this
[1:04:16] ends up in verse
[1:04:18] 21 but the Philistines took him and put
[1:04:22] out his
[1:04:24] eyes where his problem was all
[1:04:27] along it's done in a way to show this
[1:04:31] this is me I'm emphasizing this it's
[1:04:33] done in a way to show that this was
[1:04:35] Samson's
[1:04:37] problem and in some weird way maybe they
[1:04:40] shouldn't have fix the
[1:04:42] problem maybe they should have just tied
[1:04:44] him up and always tempted him with
[1:04:45] Philistine women but they put out his
[1:04:48] eyes and brought him down to Gaza and
[1:04:50] bound him with feathers of brass what a
[1:04:53] phrase and he had grind in the prison
[1:04:55] house
[1:04:57] what a sad sad picture to have your eyes
[1:05:02] plucked
[1:05:03] out the spiritual condition of
[1:05:07] Samson the physical representation of
[1:05:09] where he had been blind all along a
[1:05:11] physical representation of what he
[1:05:13] probably should have done in the
[1:05:14] beginning is to not allow himself always
[1:05:16] to be driven by the lust of the eyes to
[1:05:19] realize that women had become a problem
[1:05:20] in his life and it was maybe so
[1:05:22] systematic that when we're first
[1:05:23] introduced to him in chapter 14 his
[1:05:25] parents say will you ever find a good
[1:05:27] girl why are you always running after
[1:05:28] these women finds one that he has to
[1:05:31] have she's Pleasant to my eyes she fits
[1:05:33] for me this is the one I want he marries
[1:05:34] her and immediately in her Youth and
[1:05:36] maybe in his youth sure in her
[1:05:38] vulnerability those of her family and
[1:05:40] her and the people in her City
[1:05:41] manipulate her and cause her in her fear
[1:05:44] to get the answer from Samson and this
[1:05:46] betrayal in Samson's heart left a deep
[1:05:48] wound because now the woman he wants
[1:05:49] he's aranged from he can't marry her
[1:05:51] she's given to a friend of his in his
[1:05:53] anger he acts out and and the rest of
[1:05:56] the time we never see him marrying again
[1:05:58] we just see him visiting a harlot
[1:06:01] getting in trouble and then we see him
[1:06:02] visiting
[1:06:05] Delilah and I don't
[1:06:07] know what was going on in Samson's mind
[1:06:10] was it purely
[1:06:11] lust was he just so taken uh with
[1:06:16] her where he was
[1:06:19] just he he was infatuated he was sprung
[1:06:22] he had to have her and it's this
[1:06:23] physical connection he just can't quite
[1:06:25] I don't what we could lay it down on
[1:06:28] necessarily except that in his heart and
[1:06:30] in his mind as a man with everything
[1:06:32] that was happening he couldn't break
[1:06:35] free
[1:06:38] Samson the the brother Brandon when he
[1:06:40] preaches it you know where's your
[1:06:41] strength on preaches run for your life
[1:06:43] and he preaches once more and he's
[1:06:45] calling out to even that as he preaches
[1:06:47] it to that congregation their Life
[1:06:49] Tabernacle in shreport which was like
[1:06:51] the pentec Pinnacle of Pentecostal
[1:06:54] movement they they didn't they they were
[1:06:57] he's saying what has happened to you
[1:06:58] where is your strength
[1:07:02] gone and it seems like after the first
[1:07:05] one Samson wake
[1:07:07] up wake up Samson do you see what's
[1:07:12] happening and in the end brother Bram
[1:07:14] says look at this picture of this
[1:07:15] demoralized
[1:07:17] church that's lost its hold with God and
[1:07:19] lost its hold with the word of God now I
[1:07:22] will say I don't believe the bride will
[1:07:24] ever get there
[1:07:27] I believe the bride is
[1:07:30] secure but Satan can try to lay
[1:07:32] stumbling
[1:07:35] blocks and so in Matthew chapter 29
[1:07:37] Jesus says if a man lookth upon a woman
[1:07:39] to lust after and his heart lust after
[1:07:41] he's committed adultery with him in his
[1:07:42] heart already it says and if thy right
[1:07:44] eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it
[1:07:47] from thee for it is profitable for thee
[1:07:49] that one of thy members should perish
[1:07:52] and not thy whole body should be cast
[1:07:54] into hell he repeats something very
[1:07:56] similar in Matthew chapter
[1:07:58] 18 If thy eye offend you you know what
[1:08:01] it means cause you to stumble if your
[1:08:04] eye places a stumbling block before you
[1:08:06] or some sort of hindrance in your way
[1:08:07] the word is root of
[1:08:10] scandalize if your eye causes you to
[1:08:14] distrust what you ought to
[1:08:17] trust deny your
[1:08:19] eye it's not asking you that you
[1:08:21] literally pluck out your eye although
[1:08:23] I've been told the story that at a
[1:08:24] family Camp many years ago fola there in
[1:08:27] in Michigan that someone at the altar
[1:08:28] took a pencil and began to gouge their
[1:08:30] eye out in a message meeting taking the
[1:08:32] scripture literally if your eye offends
[1:08:34] you then pluck out your eye Jesus once
[1:08:36] again is using maybe this dramatic
[1:08:38] expression to get our
[1:08:40] attention if your eye offends you then
[1:08:43] pluck it out because you'd be better off
[1:08:45] entering into heaven you'd be better off
[1:08:47] going to the grave and into the presence
[1:08:49] of God missing one eye than to
[1:08:52] constantly defend and keep the eye and
[1:08:54] lose your
[1:08:56] Soul if your eye is causing you to
[1:08:58] distrust what you ought to trust if your
[1:09:01] eye is causing you to be disloyal if
[1:09:02] your eye is causing you to be struck
[1:09:04] with to be fear afraid with amazement if
[1:09:07] your eye is leading you astray then deny
[1:09:10] the eye cover it
[1:09:13] up to pluck it out is to ca to dull that
[1:09:17] sense that is driving you what a what an
[1:09:19] interesting Jos between Samson who has
[1:09:22] his eye plucked out and Jesus telling us
[1:09:24] to have more control and cover over the
[1:09:26] mind of our our
[1:09:28] hearts and brother bam says this Satan
[1:09:31] tries today to every Christian to pluck
[1:09:34] out his spiritual sight that he can only
[1:09:38] follow the intellectual sense of things
[1:09:41] and not the sense of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:43] leading
[1:09:44] him there's your lust of the
[1:09:46] eyes
[1:09:48] intellectualism
[1:09:50] emotionalism it's the same
[1:09:52] disease it's the same eye problem
[1:09:55] he's trying to pluck out your spiritual
[1:09:58] sight so that you'll follow natural
[1:10:00] sight the lust of the eyes the lust of
[1:10:03] the flesh the pride of life and not the
[1:10:06] sense of the Holy Spirit which what
[1:10:07] sense is that faith and what is its
[1:10:10] final resting place the word not
[1:10:13] sensation not not
[1:10:15] intellectualism not emotionalism but the
[1:10:18] word of
[1:10:20] God Amen let's stand
