[0:00] um
[0:01] my title is uh total worship
[0:04] and teaching on christian giving and
[0:07] we're going to be
[0:08] exploring this morning the subject of
[0:10] tithes and offerings and just felt the
[0:12] lord really impress it upon my heart to
[0:14] do so yesterday had other things that we
[0:17] were prepared to minister but then this
[0:19] subjects it seemed relevant especially
[0:20] some of the things that we want to talk
[0:22] about this afternoon
[0:23] the deacons are going to be sharing some
[0:25] things trustees and
[0:27] in some of the things that they might be
[0:28] expressing i think would be important
[0:30] for us to have this kind of background
[0:32] and it's actually some things that i
[0:33] thought perhaps
[0:34] i would was going to share
[0:36] with the church i'm actually just going
[0:38] to do it this morning
[0:39] through the word of god so it's on total
[0:41] worship and that's the first part i
[0:42] really want to look at
[0:44] but we're looking we're teaching on
[0:46] christian giving and it's a vast subject
[0:48] and i believe it's a subject that
[0:49] deserves attention if it's in the word
[0:51] of god if it's uh if it's part of god's
[0:53] word then it deserves our attention and
[0:56] it certainly is deserving of our
[0:57] understanding
[0:59] and there is uh it's important to
[1:00] recognize as i'm kind of titling it
[1:03] christian giving or using that phrase to
[1:05] describe our tithe and offerings uh it's
[1:08] important to recognize our duty to those
[1:10] things
[1:11] maybe even more importantly our liberty
[1:13] in pursuing those things and doing those
[1:15] things and then the blessing that's
[1:17] related to our giving unto the lord so
[1:20] there's a part we want to recognize that
[1:21] it's a duty but then also recognize the
[1:23] liberty that we have as christians to do
[1:25] it that may seem paradoxical but there's
[1:28] things that's required by
[1:30] the word but yet we have that liberty
[1:31] we're released
[1:33] to do it and there's certainly a
[1:34] blessing in it
[1:35] if you look at genesis chapter 4 i want
[1:37] to start here
[1:38] and this begins to develop
[1:41] my thought on total worship and how this
[1:43] is connected with worship and genesis
[1:45] chapter 4 verses 3 and 4 it says in the
[1:48] process of time it came to pass that
[1:50] cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[1:52] an offering unto the lord and abel he
[1:55] also brought
[1:56] of the firstlings of his flock and of
[1:59] the fat thereof so both have offered
[2:01] something it means that offering means a
[2:02] gift or a tribute
[2:04] a present and they're doing it unto the
[2:07] lord as an offering unto the lord so
[2:09] this is an expression of tribute to the
[2:11] lord or present to the lord it is an
[2:13] expression of worship to god
[2:16] and i'm going to be maybe mentioning
[2:18] this over and over again but no there's
[2:19] no written law
[2:21] there's no um explicit commandment that
[2:23] we see that there must be an offering or
[2:25] worship made to god so both cain and
[2:27] abel do this
[2:29] to god it says the lord had respect unto
[2:31] abel and to his offering
[2:34] so they worship god and and they're
[2:36] pouring out this uh we can say praise to
[2:38] him giving these gifts to him and
[2:40] honoring him it says in hebrews chapter
[2:42] 11 verse 4 by faith abel offered unto
[2:45] god
[2:46] a more excellent sacrifice than cain by
[2:48] which he attained witness that he was
[2:50] righteous
[2:51] god testified of his gifts and by it
[2:53] being dead yet speaketh
[2:56] and so there's something that was even i
[2:58] want to look at it in two ways we know
[3:00] that the blood of abel speaks
[3:02] and the uh as we see in the scripture
[3:05] but then there is a something that the
[3:07] offering speaks of as he offers this up
[3:09] to the lord by faith abel offered a more
[3:12] excellent worship a more excellent
[3:14] sacrifice god
[3:15] recognized and testified of that gift
[3:18] and that present
[3:19] and so even his offering is speaking to
[3:22] us that it holds some truth or some
[3:24] relevance to us
[3:25] and when it says by faith abel offered
[3:27] we know it's by revelation that he
[3:29] worshipped
[3:30] so abel worshipped by revelation in his
[3:33] offering in his gift-giving he's not
[3:35] compelled by law he's not compelled by
[3:37] fear but by revelation he offers up the
[3:40] sacrifice to god
[3:42] and it is this image of
[3:45] abel's offering uh that the in this very
[3:48] first offering that even the offerings
[3:50] of the sacrifices and the offerings of
[3:52] the law
[3:53] reflect back to
[3:55] so when abel makes this offering it is
[3:58] even foreshadowing the ceremonial laws
[4:01] of offerings and sacrifices that israel
[4:03] partake in hundreds of years later and
[4:06] so we know it speaks of a greater
[4:07] sacrifice christ but intervening in
[4:09] there is all the types and symbols of
[4:12] the law in which they offer
[4:14] so it's this offering this worship the
[4:17] sacrifice to god
[4:18] it's by revelation
[4:20] it's it's from it's to honor god and to
[4:23] give him praise
[4:25] and i believe the act of giving as a
[4:28] christian under the new covenant
[4:30] is an act of worship in the same way
[4:32] that abel comes by revelation uh we too
[4:35] worship the lord in spirit and in truth
[4:37] and it's important to catch that your
[4:39] giving unto the lord is part of that
[4:41] worship
[4:42] in the new testament there's actually
[4:43] three different words that are used for
[4:46] worship
[4:47] and i want to i want to establish this
[4:48] if you could um
[4:50] at the very beginning maybe you may know
[4:53] exactly where i'm going you may have
[4:54] heard it all before uh let's just
[4:56] pretend we're facing this for the first
[4:58] time
[4:59] um and then or you imagine that our
[5:02] neighbors next door in the apartment
[5:03] next door are visiting this morning and
[5:05] you want them to get this so you're
[5:07] pulling with everything you can you're
[5:08] saying lord please help them to
[5:10] understand this but this is a very
[5:11] important foundation that i want to lay
[5:13] and i want this to hold right in the
[5:14] center of your thoughts
[5:16] in these three different words that are
[5:17] used in the new testament i'm not going
[5:19] to share the greek with you but the
[5:21] first word that's used of worship means
[5:22] to show homage or to give reverence
[5:25] there's another word that's translated
[5:27] to worship it means to show devotion or
[5:29] to revere
[5:30] and then there's another word that's
[5:31] translated to worship it means to serve
[5:33] or to offer gifts or to perform service
[5:36] and in each one they kind of share in
[5:37] the similar thought to show reverence or
[5:40] homage to pay homage or honor to show
[5:42] devotion or to offer gifts or to perform
[5:44] service that third word is used here in
[5:47] philippians chapter 3 verse 3 for we
[5:50] are the circumcision which worship god
[5:53] in the spirit and rejoice in christ
[5:55] jesus and have no confidence in the
[5:57] flesh
[5:58] so we worship we offer gifts we perform
[6:01] service we serve god that's the word
[6:03] that's used we which worship god we
[6:05] serve him we offer up things to him we
[6:07] perform service to him we do it in the
[6:09] spirit
[6:11] and worship as we hear the word
[6:13] frequently used i want to
[6:15] definitely make the point that it's it's
[6:17] more than just our songs
[6:20] it's more than
[6:21] lifted hands we hear worship most often
[6:23] the context of music
[6:25] so we have a worship leader we have
[6:27] worship songs you have a worship
[6:28] playlist
[6:29] and we use worship to speak more to the
[6:32] dynamics of song service than maybe the
[6:35] whole idea of our lives being a worship
[6:38] the whole idea of us offering our very
[6:40] lives as a sacrifice and even our words
[6:43] and our dress and our activities
[6:45] everything being a worship to the lord
[6:48] revelations chapter 16 verse 2 this may
[6:50] be a curious place to start in laying
[6:53] this foundation and it says in the first
[6:55] went and poured out his vial upon the
[6:56] earth and there fell in noisome and
[6:58] grief is sore upon the men which had the
[7:00] mark of the beast upon them which
[7:02] worshipped his image so many other
[7:04] scriptures we could have brought into
[7:05] this picture
[7:06] but i wanted you to see that the mark of
[7:08] the beast is upon them that worship the
[7:11] image of the beast
[7:13] and this worship of this worship of the
[7:15] beast
[7:16] it's to uh worship if i could say it
[7:18] this way
[7:19] and i'll bring it back to a statement
[7:21] worship is your belief in action
[7:24] and so your worship is your belief in
[7:26] action it's it's your conviction that's
[7:28] evidenced by some sort of support um
[7:31] some sort of activity or works expressed
[7:34] what your conviction and your faith is
[7:36] and so here it said that they had the
[7:38] mark of the beast and they worshipped
[7:40] his image and brother banam
[7:42] wrote this in the church age this book
[7:43] this mark in the head means
[7:45] that they will have to take the doctrine
[7:48] of the church system which is
[7:49] trinitarianism etc and the mark in the
[7:52] hand which means to do the will of the
[7:54] world church
[7:55] so catch that the expression of worship
[7:58] is in to believe but then it's also in
[8:00] to do the will of
[8:02] so it's in believing something and it's
[8:03] in the support of it this is the
[8:05] expression of worship uh this is
[8:07] devotion to the false image is to uh is
[8:10] to believe something but then show your
[8:12] support in it or do the will of it and
[8:14] that and i'm wanting just to see that
[8:16] that's what worship is
[8:18] it's to believe something when you
[8:20] believe in something and you have a
[8:21] conviction of it that's why a lot of
[8:23] people's worship is empties because
[8:25] there's no faith associated with it
[8:27] and and that's why a lot of people's
[8:29] worship is hollow in that it's not
[8:31] followed by services there's not some
[8:33] performance or to do the will of god
[8:36] with it
[8:37] and gabriel's instructions to daniel i'm
[8:39] just going to take a deep breath and
[8:40] slow down
[8:41] i think i'm nervous
[8:48] it says in gabriel's instructions to
[8:49] daniel he says i like to worship don't
[8:52] you
[8:53] we don't come to church just to hear a
[8:54] sermon
[8:57] i think we the preachers need to hear
[8:58] that we don't come to church just to
[9:00] hear a sermon
[9:02] he said that goes with it but we come to
[9:04] church to worship
[9:06] worship in the spirit and in truth so
[9:09] you certainly want your sermon to be a
[9:10] part of that to facilitate that to
[9:12] even provoke a response of worship he
[9:14] says you've heard the truth that's the
[9:16] word
[9:17] now to worship is to express yourself to
[9:19] him amen that's what worship is worship
[9:22] is an expression of yourself to him and
[9:24] just by using that phrase though it's in
[9:26] the context of a church service the word
[9:28] has gone forth now express yourself to
[9:30] him you could take that definition of
[9:32] worship worship is to express yourself
[9:34] to him and find out that i can be
[9:37] worshipping him every time i breathe
[9:40] at all moments because what i want my
[9:41] life to be is a song to him what i want
[9:43] my life to be as a sweet savior to him i
[9:45] want my life to be an offering as paul
[9:47] says present yourselves present your
[9:49] bodies as a sacrifice as an offering as
[9:51] a worship to god and so the way that i
[9:54] live the way that i talk the way that i
[9:56] act the way that i treat others is
[9:58] expressing myself and i want to express
[10:00] myself to him i want to worship him in
[10:04] the message all things brother brahm
[10:06] says today our tradition is taking the
[10:08] power out of our worship
[10:10] by our own traditions
[10:12] we're taking the power out of our
[10:13] worship
[10:15] and so traditions and the wrong kind of
[10:16] mentality or any kind of approach to
[10:18] worship can take the power out of your
[10:20] worship so there's power in worship
[10:23] worship is to express yourself to him
[10:26] and what can hinder that is tradition
[10:28] and it's really interesting what can
[10:30] make something a tradition it may not be
[10:32] the act itself that makes it tradition
[10:33] but it's your mindset towards it
[10:36] communion and feet washing is by no
[10:39] means a tradition it's a commandment in
[10:40] the word of god it's something that i'm
[10:42] very excited to do together as a church
[10:44] in the next month and it's uh it's
[10:47] something we do because it's in the word
[10:49] of god but it's very easy to take the
[10:51] word
[10:52] turn it into a tradition and make it of
[10:54] no effect
[10:55] just by our traditions make the word of
[10:57] god and no effect or you're doing the
[10:59] semblance of it but you take the power
[11:02] of it away just by making it tradition
[11:05] by approaching it with the mindset well
[11:07] we have to do this by approaching it
[11:09] absent-mindedly
[11:10] just doing it
[11:12] and if we're not coming to church under
[11:14] expectation if we're not coming to
[11:15] church because we believe god's going to
[11:17] meet us here and the word's going to go
[11:18] forth if we're not coming with an
[11:20] attitude that this is in your words you
[11:22] promise to meet us here and there's and
[11:24] associated with certain promises and
[11:25] recognizing there's a pull in your heart
[11:27] to do that
[11:28] and to be here and be a part of it then
[11:30] you make even that
[11:32] prophecy and that scripture traditional
[11:34] and when you make it tradition you take
[11:36] the power right out of it
[11:39] and so when we worship we do not worship
[11:41] under the law
[11:43] we do not worship under a tradition
[11:46] because worship in itself is not a
[11:48] man-made idea
[11:49] to worship is not a man-made invention
[11:52] or construct it it is something that is
[11:55] related to god
[11:57] and proverbs chapter 3 verse 9
[12:01] it says honor the lord with thy
[12:03] substance
[12:04] and with the firstfruits of thine
[12:06] increase
[12:07] so you're to honor the lord worship the
[12:08] lord with what you've gained
[12:10] uh get what you the in your thy
[12:12] substance your riches your mammon
[12:15] and and it says uh and with the first
[12:17] fruits of thine increase so this is a
[12:19] and he's alluding to the tithe and to
[12:21] offering
[12:22] so honor the lord with thy substance
[12:24] when you have substance when you have
[12:25] increase when you have uh wealth riches
[12:28] and possessions he says honor him with
[12:30] them
[12:31] though the things we own
[12:34] the things that we
[12:36] entertain ourselves with we want to give
[12:38] some thought as to whether or not we're
[12:39] honoring the lord with it and it says
[12:41] and with the first fruits of thy
[12:42] increase so there's a giving that's as
[12:45] it alludes to the tithe and an offering
[12:46] of your substance an offering of your
[12:48] increase to the lord and then notice the
[12:50] blessing that comes with it so shall thy
[12:53] barns be filled with plenty and thy
[12:55] presses shall burst out with new wine
[12:58] this is a promise connected with
[13:00] offering and giving thy lord honor the
[13:02] lord with your substance worship him
[13:04] honor him and give to him and then with
[13:06] the first fruits of thy increase and
[13:08] your barns will be filled with plenty
[13:09] your presses shall burst out with new
[13:11] wine this is god promising that if you
[13:13] honor him with your substance and you
[13:15] give of your increase that he will
[13:17] increase your increase
[13:19] he will bless your presses he will fill
[13:21] your barns with plenty
[13:23] and this is this honor it's worship the
[13:25] lord with it you're going to worship and
[13:27] praise and offer thanksgiving and we uh
[13:31] we had a number of scriptures lined up
[13:33] just to show
[13:34] the different offerings in the old
[13:36] testament that are just praise they're
[13:37] just thanksgiving they're given to him
[13:39] to glorify him to
[13:41] send up adoration and a sweet aroma to
[13:44] him
[13:45] the very offering itself is an act of
[13:47] praise in the old testament
[13:50] in the message of total deliverance
[13:52] brother graham's telling a story how
[13:53] some men set up a foundation
[13:55] and in setting up this foundation
[13:57] they wanted to give money to certain
[13:59] causes and he says and they called me to
[14:01] oakland for a meeting
[14:03] and they had the money they'd sponsor it
[14:04] all in their foundation and i'm just
[14:06] providing the key phrase here brother
[14:08] fred and i tried for some money
[14:11] that brother fred had that i would not
[14:13] take as an individual so then we decided
[14:15] we'd give it to the canadian people and
[14:17] not even take up an offering
[14:20] so you notice what's happening
[14:21] is someone wanted to help support the
[14:23] meetings they were going to take this
[14:24] money put it through this foundation to
[14:25] support the meetings and not even have
[14:27] to take up an offering in the meeting he
[14:28] says but it didn't go so good
[14:31] the meetings were fine but because we
[14:32] didn't take up an offering
[14:35] he says i don't care if the church is
[14:36] worth a hundred billion dollars
[14:39] you still owe it to god to take up an
[14:41] offering
[14:44] if the church was worth a hundred
[14:45] billion dollars if someone wants to
[14:46] claim that by faith we're not going to
[14:48] stop you
[14:49] but we'd still have to take up an
[14:50] offering
[14:51] right he says i don't care if the church
[14:52] is worth a hundred billion dollars you
[14:54] still owe it to god to take up an
[14:55] offering that's part of the worship
[14:59] so taking up the offering in these
[15:00] meetings he said ah you know the
[15:01] meetings were fine
[15:03] but because we didn't take up an
[15:05] offering it didn't go so good
[15:07] he noticed there was something different
[15:09] he says you rob as much as i've been
[15:11] against money and things like that i
[15:12] find out when a man's wrong you might as
[15:14] well admit you're wrong because brother
[15:16] fred and i seen it pan out not so good
[15:18] so brother is admitting that just taking
[15:20] someone who's wealthy or taking some
[15:22] donations and find it through a certain
[15:24] channel so it could pay for everything
[15:25] and not give the opportunity for the
[15:27] people to give reduce the quality of the
[15:30] meetings just to use that kind of
[15:32] language it didn't pan out so good and
[15:34] he's himself willing to admit you know
[15:36] what we had the money it paid for
[15:38] everything nobody was burdened with it
[15:40] but if you don't uh if you don't you
[15:43] still owe it to god to take up an offer
[15:45] and he says the meetings weren't what
[15:46] they could be because he didn't take up
[15:48] an offering
[15:50] and this is the part i want you to say
[15:51] it's part of worship
[15:53] the very act of giving is part of
[15:56] worship and the message jehovah miracles
[15:58] again i'm just providing you with the
[16:00] the key word here that you could ponder
[16:02] as we lead up to it and the so brother
[16:04] he's in a conversation with the brother
[16:05] he says well i'll tell you what i'll do
[16:07] i'll just take the check
[16:08] and you'll come and go to the meeting we
[16:09] won't have to take up one offering or
[16:11] anything i said that's fine i'll do that
[16:13] then said i did that and it was not a
[16:15] success
[16:17] so think of that how uh how he expresses
[16:20] this but john you could go ahead and
[16:21] show the part so they know what i'm
[16:22] coming to
[16:23] he says i did that and it was not in
[16:25] excess people have to have something in
[16:28] the meeting
[16:30] and i think it's important to think
[16:31] about this and not just in the context
[16:33] of holding special services but just in
[16:34] the meeting in your participation
[16:37] and you're coming to church it's their
[16:38] meeting and they'd meet me on the street
[16:40] and ask me what's the matter with this
[16:41] meeting we haven't got no part into it
[16:44] they don't even take up an offering
[16:47] no this is wonderful that the people's
[16:49] attitude they come they hear the word of
[16:51] god they see miracles signs and wonders
[16:53] happen and there's still a part of them
[16:55] that feels a little bit empty because
[16:57] they wanted to participate in the
[16:59] meeting by giving
[17:01] and he says the people as i mentioned a
[17:03] moment ago the people have to have a
[17:05] part they have to have something in the
[17:07] meeting he says people have to have
[17:08] something in the meeting he says they
[17:10] don't even take up an offering so an
[17:11] offering is a part of worship
[17:15] to take up an offering to give people an
[17:17] opportunity to give is a part of worship
[17:18] he said that's right i know more than
[17:20] ever since the other day when i was
[17:22] going to give hattie right back that 20
[17:24] that she pledged towards the new
[17:25] tabernacle in jeffersonville the lord
[17:28] said just let her alone
[17:30] why would he do that oh because she's
[17:32] poor she doesn't have means she could
[17:33] really use the money and here of her own
[17:35] free will she's wanting to give a
[17:37] building fund donation something to help
[17:38] the new tabernacle and brother branham's
[17:41] going to tell her give it back to her
[17:42] tell her not to and the lord says stop
[17:45] don't do it
[17:46] because we might look at things in a
[17:47] very carnal way that well
[17:49] you only give if you have uh you know
[17:51] you shouldn't have to give you're too
[17:53] poor you're this or you're that or use
[17:55] it for something else whatever the
[17:56] carnal attitude might be and it might be
[17:58] you not wanting to give because you have
[17:59] certain ideas and reasons why you don't
[18:01] want to give and the lord's attitude was
[18:03] leave her alone let her give amen
[18:06] he says a few minutes later i see why he
[18:08] let her alone so i just made a promise
[18:09] in my heart i was never going to try to
[18:11] stop anybody that wanted to give
[18:13] something towards the kingdom of god
[18:15] i did it many times turn it down just as
[18:17] fast as i could and i've realized that i
[18:19] have robbed people by doing that because
[18:22] god had a program for that
[18:24] so we can rob god and not give him but
[18:26] then you could also rob the people by
[18:29] not letting them have the opportunity to
[18:31] give
[18:32] and i know we've heard these statements
[18:34] before and i wanted to rehearse them to
[18:35] you it's often said i know in our family
[18:38] and we've heard it
[18:39] i know sister elizabeth she was raised
[18:41] it was taught to her this way that
[18:43] an offering to take up tithes and
[18:45] offerings even in the church service is
[18:47] part of our worship
[18:49] he says an offering is a part of worship
[18:51] that's part of the worship to take up an
[18:53] offering
[18:55] then the message of man running from the
[18:56] presence of the lord he says if there's
[18:58] any strangers with us we've made that a
[18:59] policy to never beg bum
[19:02] push people for money we pass the
[19:04] collection plate which is a religious
[19:06] act
[19:08] he says i've tried it many times
[19:10] not even to pass the complexion
[19:12] collection plate at all but it don't
[19:14] work
[19:15] he said i've tried not to pass it but
[19:17] you know what it doesn't work he says
[19:19] because giving is a part of our religion
[19:21] it's part of our duty
[19:24] so this is part of our religion it's
[19:26] part of our duty and so there is a
[19:28] religion which is pure and undefiled
[19:30] what does even paul teach us that it's
[19:31] the pure religion pure unfollows to
[19:33] visit the widow in her affliction
[19:35] and so there's there's a visitation to
[19:37] the poor there's a an assistance and
[19:39] aiding those and others so par part of
[19:41] our religion and part of our duty
[19:44] even in those who
[19:45] perform the service and even those that
[19:47] are in the service to pass the
[19:48] collection plate as he says and to give
[19:50] he says no matter if it's just a dime or
[19:52] whatever it is or a penny
[19:54] he says so you see when people want to
[19:56] give you've got to give them the
[19:58] opportunity to do so
[20:01] he says but i think that we have to pass
[20:03] the offering plate notice this phrase i
[20:05] wanted to provide it in order to make it
[20:06] a complete
[20:07] religious service
[20:10] this is a phrase that's very familiar to
[20:12] us
[20:13] that a church service is not complete
[20:15] without taking up an offering
[20:17] now does this does this require
[20:19] does this establish a law that a church
[20:22] you have to pass the offering baskets in
[20:24] order uh for there to be you have to
[20:26] have someone come and pray over the ties
[20:27] and offerings pass out the plates in
[20:29] order for there to be
[20:31] uh total worship or for the service to
[20:33] be complete
[20:34] i don't believe he's trying to establish
[20:35] a law
[20:37] but i do believe you want to give people
[20:38] an opportunity to give
[20:41] having some opportunity for people to
[20:43] give to support it's part of our duty if
[20:45] you don't if you don't it doesn't work
[20:48] we read it a moment ago how he we tried
[20:51] but it didn't go so good and i i have to
[20:53] just admit when i've been wrong when
[20:54] i've tried to do something that doesn't
[20:56] quite pan out it's when you haven't
[20:58] given people the opportunity to give
[21:01] and i would even say that uh
[21:03] and then even i want to come back to
[21:04] that's what completes the service
[21:07] we are we gather together to worship the
[21:09] lord and having that opportunity to give
[21:11] and even your giving completes the
[21:13] service completes the worship it makes
[21:15] it a total worship when we come and we
[21:17] participate in our our praise and the
[21:19] lifting of hands and the songs that are
[21:21] sung and the leadership of different
[21:22] things that's all part of our praise and
[21:24] when we're able to give in our we've
[21:26] given with our time we've given with our
[21:28] lips we've given with our clapping
[21:30] and our attention and everything and
[21:31] then when we've given even of our
[21:33] substance and we've honored the lord he
[21:34] says even if it's just a dime or
[21:36] whatever we're completing that service
[21:39] and i would even say that
[21:41] if there's a giving people an
[21:43] opportunity
[21:44] to give
[21:46] and to complete this religious service
[21:48] is a part of our duty it's important
[21:49] that we understand what it is
[21:53] and this off an offering is a part of
[21:55] worship if you say he just given a dime
[21:57] just give it a dollar well what are you
[21:58] giving it for
[22:01] if there's a thermometer a meter next to
[22:03] it showing how much money is going to be
[22:05] raised in your giving to get the needle
[22:06] up so that you fill up the thermometer
[22:08] then that's probably not worship
[22:11] if you're giving because someone's
[22:12] twisted your arm if you're giving
[22:13] because it's a it is a cover charge
[22:16] right
[22:18] if given because you have to pay for
[22:19] your seat
[22:20] um and because you want to get in well
[22:22] we'll let anybody who doesn't want to
[22:23] have to sit on the front row you pay 50
[22:25] bucks you won't sit on the front row
[22:26] that's not a that's not worship that's
[22:27] not an offering that's a tax
[22:29] uh under under a uh
[22:32] under
[22:33] compelling you or something
[22:34] under the wrong kind of compilation is
[22:36] what i'm thinking just the wrong kind of
[22:37] force
[22:39] and so in genesis chapter 14
[22:42] this is a story of abraham meeting
[22:43] melchizedek
[22:45] verses 18 to 20 the melchizedek king of
[22:46] salem brought forth bread and wine and
[22:48] he was the priest of the most high god
[22:50] now we know who this melchizedek is
[22:53] it is
[22:54] it is god in flesh and he blessed him
[22:57] and said blessed be abraham the most
[22:59] high god possessor of heaven and earth
[23:02] and blessed be the most high god which
[23:03] hath delivered thine enemies into thy
[23:05] hand and abraham
[23:07] as the bible tells us abraham gave says
[23:10] abraham gave him tithes of all
[23:13] now when abraham gave there's no law
[23:15] there's no commandment there's no
[23:17] ordinance but he gives
[23:18] and what is he doing he's worshipping
[23:20] melchizedek
[23:22] he came and he brought forth bread and
[23:24] wine and here now in an act of
[23:26] thanksgiving and he realizes that it's
[23:29] god who's delivered his enemy into his
[23:31] hands it's god who's brought the spoils
[23:33] here's abraham's not dividing uh the
[23:36] things that he recovered he's giving
[23:37] those back to those who had lost but now
[23:39] the spoils of the enemy he gives a tie
[23:42] the 10 as we would say
[23:44] to back to melchizedek it's an offering
[23:46] to him of his increase of these spoils
[23:49] and what is he doing it for it's not
[23:51] attacked so he can go home it's not a
[23:54] it's not just merely uh well since you
[23:56] stopped me since you gave me bread he's
[23:57] not paying for the bread and wine he's
[24:00] worshiping
[24:01] abraham is this is an act of reverence
[24:03] of service and honor given to
[24:06] melchizedek and in the old testament and
[24:09] in the new testament the act of giving
[24:10] of a natural substance even the giving
[24:12] of fruits and
[24:13] your increase is connected with this
[24:16] same worship
[24:18] abel offering up to god a more excellent
[24:20] sacrifice in genesis 4
[24:23] abraham offering in genesis chapter 14.
[24:26] this is the very image of our giving as
[24:28] christians
[24:30] genesis 14 it was an act of worship
[24:33] expressing gratitude and thanksgiving
[24:35] to god
[24:37] and brother brown looks at this in
[24:38] hebrews chapter 7 part 1
[24:40] and he makes a very uh he kind of asks a
[24:43] question that's very thought-provoking
[24:46] what would a man take tithings for if he
[24:48] was never born and ever will die and was
[24:50] from the beginning to the end never had
[24:52] no father a mother a descent and on the
[24:55] heavens and earth and all of it
[24:57] why would he take tithe
[25:00] that's a good question i mean why in the
[25:01] world
[25:02] does the prince of the priest of the
[25:04] most high god the king of salem
[25:08] need a tenth of the spoils that abraham
[25:10] just took from these other kings
[25:12] why would he do it why would he ask
[25:15] abraham to pay tithes
[25:17] you see what a strict thing it is to pay
[25:19] tithes
[25:20] tithing is right
[25:22] every christian is duty bound to pay
[25:24] tithe that's right never has been
[25:26] changed
[25:29] it's it's expressing something brother
[25:32] graham's identifying that in this very
[25:34] act of abraham offering up to god god
[25:38] was establishing what an important thing
[25:40] it was how much it was connected with
[25:43] our worship and how a god who doesn't
[25:45] necessarily need your money
[25:48] right
[25:50] you can give it still as a sacrifice you
[25:53] still give it as an offer and you give
[25:55] it as an act of worship and praise as
[25:57] the bible says in hebrews 7 4 now
[25:59] consider how great this man was unto
[26:01] whom even the patriarch abraham gave the
[26:03] tenth of his spoils
[26:05] abraham worshiped god by giving a
[26:07] portion back to god he worshipped god by
[26:09] giving him substance the brother of him
[26:11] says this is showing us what a strict
[26:13] thing it is to do this he says every
[26:15] christian is duty bound to do it it's
[26:17] never been changed
[26:20] now remember that it's never been
[26:21] changed i think it's a very important
[26:23] statement especially in the light of um
[26:26] a lot of forceful teaching
[26:28] um a lot of um
[26:30] very
[26:31] uh i want to say intellectual but i
[26:33] don't want to put a a bad label on it
[26:35] but just efforts
[26:37] through the word of god and identifying
[26:39] things in the new testament and
[26:41] and trying to strict language in the new
[26:43] testament say well we're clearly not
[26:45] under the law which we're not right
[26:47] we're not under the law anymore and that
[26:49] the very laws that god gave to israel
[26:51] that would relate to tithing do not
[26:54] explicitly
[26:56] and are not imposed upon us as
[26:58] christians on the same duty as an
[27:00] israelite had to the temple the same
[27:02] duty that the israelites had to the
[27:03] levites but yet brother branham is
[27:05] saying that there's a duty expressed in
[27:08] abraham's offering pre-law
[27:11] right
[27:12] before commandment was given
[27:14] he offers up this offering and he says
[27:17] it's now a duty that's not
[27:22] the church choosing law for grace i want
[27:24] you to catch this
[27:27] he says suffers to pay the preacher
[27:29] where'd you ever get such a thing as
[27:31] that
[27:31] in the
[27:32] scripture there's such a thing as that
[27:35] scripture he says tithes pays the
[27:37] preacher
[27:38] he's to live by the tithes of the people
[27:40] that's important principle for us to
[27:42] understand your tithe is what allows the
[27:44] preacher to live
[27:46] your tithing is what allows a pastor to
[27:48] uh sometimes it's uh pastors have the
[27:51] opportunity to be full-time in ministry
[27:53] and it's the tithing of the people that
[27:55] allow that pastor to do funerals
[27:58] on a tuesday morning when everybody else
[27:59] would be at work or friday afternoon and
[28:01] do weddings and sometimes fly i've seen
[28:04] pastors do this i've done it even myself
[28:07] even when i wasn't a pastor fly overseas
[28:09] and perform weddings
[28:11] i was a
[28:13] texan
[28:14] officiating a sermon in germany for two
[28:16] people from ghana
[28:19] and that was unique
[28:21] very very unique lasted all day long
[28:23] nothing started on time and as soon as i
[28:25] was done they wanted me to go do
[28:26] something else saying nope take me to
[28:27] the hotel
[28:28] i'm not you fooled me once won't fool me
[28:30] again
[28:31] and and i still remember i had bread and
[28:33] water i thought i was staying in it was
[28:35] in berlin i thought i was staying in an
[28:37] old jail
[28:38] uh a jail converted to uh something like
[28:41] that that's what it felt like and for
[28:42] breakfast i had hot water and bread
[28:44] and it was very eye-opening to some of
[28:46] the things that the believers have to
[28:48] experience and how they live
[28:50] but this is what your tithing allows to
[28:51] happen
[28:52] it may be easy sometimes just to think
[28:54] well it's all surplus it's all excess
[28:56] but tithes paid the preacher he's to
[28:58] live off that but we had to get
[29:00] something else to do so now he's talking
[29:02] about how things have changed this whole
[29:03] modern approach we have to have our says
[29:05] we have to have our part into it and if
[29:07] they can't make it up then there's
[29:08] another society we'll do it in another
[29:10] society so just all the things that they
[29:12] try to come up with to pay the pastor he
[29:14] says in one place you know pay your
[29:16] tithes the pastor will be paid
[29:18] so he says god's way is right tithes and
[29:20] offerings go to levi which was the
[29:22] minister
[29:23] and i know he's using some very um
[29:26] summary language there if everybody
[29:27] would pay their tithe you wouldn't have
[29:29] to have any soup suppers
[29:31] you adopted something else and leave the
[29:33] tithings off
[29:34] say it's an old testament argument i'd
[29:36] like for you to prove it to me that's
[29:38] right you can't do it by
[29:42] order
[29:45] it can
[29:47] remain
[29:51] where we stand as believers
[29:53] if a prophet is going to take it look
[29:55] into the word of god and say that
[29:56] there's a there's certainly an
[29:58] application of the law but then he says
[29:59] no you can't just you can't just do away
[30:03] with it and say it's just an old
[30:04] testament argument something has
[30:06] survived in the new covenant and he says
[30:09] it's a new testament order too and as we
[30:12] read a moment ago it's part of god's
[30:13] program
[30:15] it's part of his order god has a program
[30:18] for that as he says so these are things
[30:20] that
[30:21] we are this is kind of where i realize
[30:24] i'm entering maybe into another juncture
[30:25] of this
[30:27] your your giving is worship
[30:29] it's part of your worship we see that
[30:30] established in the word of god
[30:32] and then now
[30:34] there is
[30:35] a it carries it's it's even part of our
[30:38] new testament worship
[30:39] you can't do it by god's word you can't
[30:41] prove it's just an old testament
[30:43] argument by god's word it's a new
[30:44] testament order too
[30:47] now where the difference comes or maybe
[30:50] where the the wrestling is
[30:53] arises
[30:54] is in the old testament
[30:57] it's very precise
[30:59] very clear very detailed in terms of
[31:02] giving
[31:03] the tithes or what we might even call
[31:04] offerings the different offerings that
[31:06] are given different types are different
[31:08] given
[31:09] are very detailed and very precise even
[31:11] to years in which they would apply
[31:14] even to the very things that they're
[31:15] applied to and even the percentage
[31:18] right the tithe even in itself is
[31:20] speaking of a tenth percent so there's
[31:22] detailed percentages that you can go
[31:24] into the old testament and say oh well
[31:25] this is how much percent you would need
[31:27] to give here this is how much percent
[31:28] you'd need to give here and so it's very
[31:30] detailed and even to the point to where
[31:32] it says well you want to give a tithe
[31:34] and if you can't carry it to the house
[31:36] of god convert it to money
[31:39] and then come and give it
[31:40] and so when it comes to tithing a lot of
[31:42] the questions are well do i tithe on net
[31:44] do i tithe on grows who do i give it to
[31:46] how do i how do i give it there's a lot
[31:47] of questions that relate to it because
[31:49] the new testament isn't as precise
[31:52] the new testament isn't as detailed and
[31:54] i want to say even though the new
[31:55] testament isn't as precise and detailed
[31:57] as the old testament it's the old
[31:59] testament that gives us the image or the
[32:01] model of our christian giving
[32:04] in hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 it says
[32:06] for the law having a shadow of good
[32:07] things come and not the very image of
[32:10] the things can never produce without
[32:11] those sacrifice which they offered year
[32:13] by year
[32:14] continually make the comers there and
[32:16] too perfect so we realize in
[32:18] the actual offerings and sacrifices the
[32:21] shedding of blood and the ceremonial
[32:22] sacrifices could never make the
[32:24] worshiper perfect but in that offering
[32:28] and in that worship and the shedding of
[32:29] blood it was a shadow of good things to
[32:31] come
[32:33] and it says for the law having a shadow
[32:35] of good things to come so it's not just
[32:37] that particular act of shedding blood
[32:40] and spilling out the blood of a ram or a
[32:42] bull upon an altar but it's the law
[32:44] itself that has a shadow
[32:46] so there's a true image if there's a
[32:48] shadow there's a true image that's typed
[32:50] out in the old testament tithing
[32:52] there's a true image that's typed out in
[32:54] the old testament offerings
[32:56] and we could we could spend a lot of
[32:58] time today in the new testament and i
[32:59] realized i'm so nervous and i'm going so
[33:01] fast
[33:02] that uh
[33:03] that i could have probably read all the
[33:05] all the first corinthians and second
[33:06] corinthians
[33:14] in the new testament in the language
[33:17] that paul uses of given he calls it
[33:18] bounty he calls it ministry
[33:21] uh um alms maybe another word that we
[33:24] might find in the bible there's
[33:25] different ways where paul is describing
[33:27] our giving
[33:28] and you'll find that his teaching on
[33:29] giving is drawing from the offerings and
[33:32] the tithes of the old testament
[33:35] wherever paul is
[33:36] admonishing to give you'll even find
[33:38] that when jesus is talking about tithing
[33:40] you tithe on mint and cumin and you
[33:42] you're so precise and all you're given
[33:44] you see the different instances where
[33:46] jesus is speaking of it it's all
[33:48] established in the old testament jesus
[33:50] kind of gives uh makes reference to it
[33:52] in the gospels and then paul
[33:54] when he's teaching the new testament
[33:56] church about giving and being mindful of
[33:58] giving he's drawing from the old
[34:00] testament
[34:01] paul isn't establishing new rules
[34:05] he's not inventing a different way of
[34:07] making the church work as a prophet he
[34:09] sees the image that the law provided the
[34:12] law having a shadow and he carries that
[34:15] image over into a a greater substance in
[34:17] the new testament church and really to
[34:19] me i think it's absolutely remarkable
[34:22] how there was such a rigid structured
[34:24] method of providing for and supporting
[34:27] ministry and maintaining the tabernacle
[34:29] imposed by law and by threat and
[34:32] coercion in some ways in terms of how
[34:34] you can be excommunicated and put
[34:36] outside the body
[34:38] put outside the camp so to speak in
[34:40] israel under the law how that paul
[34:42] catches the revelation of that and
[34:44] teaches it in principle to the church
[34:46] and how the new testament church the
[34:48] true body of christ has taken the
[34:50] substance of that shadow and perpetuated
[34:53] the faith for a couple thousand years
[34:56] it's amazing
[34:58] now the what paul is drawing on and this
[35:00] is where i want you to maybe even you
[35:03] know wet your wet your ink or get
[35:04] sharpened your pencil
[35:06] because in the old testament there were
[35:08] three different tithes that were given
[35:11] did anybody know that anybody knew that
[35:12] there's three different kinds of ties
[35:14] you're thinking i know where he's going
[35:16] he's going to say it's 30 now you got to
[35:18] give brother aaron 30
[35:21] no
[35:22] it doesn't work that way it scaled a
[35:23] little bit because you do the
[35:25] percentages it's not quite 30
[35:27] and adjusted for inflation we might be
[35:29] there we might be there at 30.
[35:32] but there's three tithes of the old
[35:34] testament that type our christian giving
[35:36] and this is where i believe the
[35:37] distinction is going to be very good for
[35:39] us because i know as i'm reading these
[35:40] statements a christian's duty-bound hate
[35:43] always says it's singular he talks about
[35:45] passing the offering plate it's a part
[35:47] of our worship all these different
[35:49] things and it would be real easy maybe
[35:50] first just to conflate them all and
[35:51] combine them all into one thought that
[35:53] well i write a tithing check and that's
[35:55] my worship or they pass the plate and i
[35:57] throw a few bucks on the offering plate
[35:58] that's my worship but there's paul draws
[36:02] from these three different tithes
[36:03] they're called tithes in the old
[36:04] testament and i want to break them down
[36:06] into their different sections so you
[36:08] could realize that it's this these three
[36:11] givings that have brother branham says
[36:14] or that i'm i'm going to say that when
[36:15] brother brown says it's carried over
[36:16] into the new testament it's a new
[36:18] testament order it's our giving as
[36:20] believers and as christians that is part
[36:22] of the new testament order and in the
[36:24] new testament it's even itself you can
[36:26] identify it's in these three areas that
[36:28] we give as christians that make up our
[36:31] total worship
[36:32] are part of our total worship not in
[36:34] themselves make it up but they're part
[36:36] of it now they're here they are i'm
[36:37] going to go over the three and then
[36:39] we'll go over them individually
[36:42] there was a tithe which was for the
[36:43] levites
[36:44] somebody say the priesthood the ministry
[36:46] there was a tithe for levites and that
[36:48] is a type of your tithing to the pastor
[36:50] type of giving your ten percent to the
[36:52] pastor or to the ministry so there was a
[36:54] tithe for levites that's a type of your
[36:57] tithing to the pastor
[36:59] then there was a second tithe that was
[37:01] for
[37:02] and the annual festival
[37:04] and in that
[37:05] and then also and i want to kind of
[37:07] combine with it these different feast
[37:09] offerings because they work they work
[37:10] kind of together so there was these an
[37:12] annual festival that they would come and
[37:14] they would bring their tithing to
[37:16] and we'll see how it was to support the
[37:18] function of the service
[37:20] and it's a type of our offerings to the
[37:22] church
[37:23] different distinct from our tithing but
[37:25] also a tithe or a giving to the
[37:28] tabernacle to the temple for the
[37:29] services for the the feast
[37:32] and then there was a third tithe that
[37:34] was called a tithe for the poor
[37:36] and that's most often the way that it
[37:38] was summarized even in the rabbinical
[37:40] literature and things as a tithe for the
[37:41] poor believe josephus even refers to it
[37:43] that way there was a tithe to the
[37:45] levites there was a tithe to the
[37:48] tabernacle to the festivals and then
[37:50] there was a tithe for the poor
[37:52] and that tithe for the poor is a type we
[37:54] could see a type of our giving to
[37:55] missions
[37:57] because when you give to missions where
[37:58] you're giving to a work or a need that
[38:01] is present where there's maybe not other
[38:03] um not other opportunities or resources
[38:06] so you're mindful of places that are
[38:08] poor or impoverished or don't have
[38:09] buildings or ministries that need
[38:11] support and it's even a type of things
[38:13] that we might do as a special offering
[38:14] to assist somebody to give to a
[38:16] particular need so there's these three
[38:18] different tithes in the old testament
[38:20] for the levites for the festival
[38:23] services and then one for the poor
[38:26] you got those down
[38:28] first let's look at this one for the
[38:29] tithe for the levites
[38:31] this was an offering
[38:33] to the lord
[38:35] for the benefit of those who ministered
[38:37] unto the lord
[38:38] so all israel would bring sacrifices you
[38:40] have to draw from your knowledge of how
[38:41] this the temple worked and how the
[38:44] priests and even the levites because not
[38:46] every levite entered into the priesthood
[38:48] but how they all worked to support
[38:51] uh um the offering and the worship of
[38:54] the people and so this was an offering
[38:56] unto the lord that the levites partook
[38:58] in because they're the ones that had no
[39:00] inheritance in israel and they
[39:02] ministered unto the lord
[39:04] there's different scriptures we could
[39:05] use but let's look at numbers chapter 18
[39:07] just to cover this very quickly
[39:10] in numbers chapter 18 verses 20 to 24
[39:12] and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt
[39:14] have no inheritance in their land
[39:16] neither shalt thou have any part among
[39:18] them i am thy part and thy inheritance
[39:21] among the children of israel and behold
[39:23] i have given the children of levi all
[39:26] the tenth of israel for an inheritance
[39:27] for their service which they serve even
[39:30] the service of the tabernacle of the
[39:31] congregation neither must the children
[39:33] of israel henceforth come nigh to the
[39:34] tabernacle of the congregation lest they
[39:36] bear sin and die so it's creating this
[39:38] distinction
[39:39] that the levites will perform the
[39:41] service they're the ones that allah for
[39:42] the sacrifices the rest of israel will
[39:45] pay tithe to them
[39:47] for their inheritance for their living
[39:49] but the levites shall do the service of
[39:51] the tabernacle of the congregation and
[39:53] they shall bear their iniquity it shall
[39:55] be a statute forever throughout your
[39:56] generations that among the children of
[39:58] israel they have no inheritance but the
[40:00] tithes of the children of israel which
[40:02] they offer as an heave offering unto the
[40:04] lord i have given to the levites to
[40:07] inherit evil it's lifting up
[40:09] i think in one place it's like a
[40:10] throw-in it's a lifting up it's a praise
[40:12] the things that they the tithes of the
[40:14] children of israel the children of
[40:16] israel do it they're offering up a heap
[40:19] offering unto the lord
[40:21] i want you to catch this he said oh well
[40:23] they're giving 10 to the preacher or
[40:24] they're giving 10 to the levites no they
[40:27] are giving as an offering unto the lord
[40:30] i have given to the levites to inherit
[40:32] so it's given us unto the lord the
[40:34] levites then take responsibility for it
[40:36] you'll find this run through the message
[40:38] and i believe you'll find this is true
[40:39] with god's character that we have the
[40:41] responsibility as the worshiper to give
[40:43] the offering to give the heave offering
[40:45] unto the lord to give the tithe unto the
[40:47] lord and then once you give it that man
[40:50] will answer for how he uses it
[40:53] you won't have to answer how he uses it
[40:54] you give his unto the lord and you you
[40:56] have fulfilled your responsibility your
[40:58] obligation and then the man of god will
[41:00] answer for how he has used the lord's
[41:02] offering the tithes of the children of
[41:04] israel which they have offered as a
[41:06] heave off and under the lord so he says
[41:08] i
[41:08] the tithes of the children of israel i
[41:10] have given to the levites to inherit
[41:13] who gave it
[41:14] the lord has given it
[41:16] who's offered it the the children of
[41:17] israel who do they offer it to the lord
[41:21] an offering unto the lord and lord gives
[41:23] it to the levites this is
[41:26] this with this tithe
[41:28] which we use from that and i didn't want
[41:30] to get bogged down just in the wording
[41:31] of it
[41:32] but the tithe is it
[41:35] means
[41:37] this was meant to support the levites
[41:39] they were to take the the tithe and it
[41:41] would be their livelihood it would be
[41:42] their living it'd be their substance
[41:44] it'd be their food
[41:45] and and this is how they would pay the
[41:48] bills so to speak
[41:49] this is how they would live is offered
[41:51] this
[41:52] this
[41:52] offering of the children of israel to
[41:54] the lord that the lord would give as an
[41:56] inheritance to the levites
[41:59] and paul draws on this in galatians
[42:01] chapter 6 verse 6 he says let him that
[42:03] is taught in the word so you who are
[42:04] taught the word
[42:06] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[42:08] all good things
[42:10] it's a reference to you who are being
[42:12] taught communicate back to the teacher
[42:14] we say oh well does that mean to say
[42:15] amen it means to impart or share your
[42:18] means
[42:19] to me communicate means to impart to
[42:21] impart a share of your means to part a
[42:23] share of your substance so paul is using
[42:26] a language to say you who are taught
[42:28] communicate to those who are teaching or
[42:31] give a share of your means to him that
[42:33] is teaching
[42:34] now what what would paul be drawing on
[42:36] if he wasn't drawing from the very end
[42:38] of the old testament in which the
[42:40] children of israel gave an offering unto
[42:42] the lord and those that were offering
[42:44] the sacrifices
[42:46] lived by that as an inheritance he's
[42:48] drawn so if you are taught in the word
[42:50] of god share your means with the teacher
[42:53] and first timothy 5 17 to 18. this is
[42:55] maybe a more
[42:56] stark example that the elders that rule
[42:59] well be counted worthy of double honor
[43:01] especially they who labor in the word
[43:03] and doctrine
[43:04] and this is what he uses to substantiate
[43:06] it so we could we could drill down maybe
[43:08] more deeply
[43:09] on uh is it yeah verse i think maybe
[43:13] it's verse 17. i took some out there
[43:15] is it verse 17 anybody looking in their
[43:17] bible i'm glad people are still bible
[43:18] readers it's verse 17 i have 15 there
[43:21] say the bishop is just not blameless at
[43:23] all
[43:24] i have mistakes all over the place is it
[43:26] still cool in here
[43:30] it says for the scripture saith now this
[43:32] is the principle that he's alluding to
[43:34] but this i think stands to paul's
[43:37] conviction thou shalt not muzzle the ox
[43:39] that treadeth out the corn
[43:41] and the labor is worthy of his reward
[43:43] so saying that if one is laboring in the
[43:45] word then don't deprive him substance
[43:49] don't leave him empty but he says he's
[43:51] worthy of his reward he's worthy of
[43:54] something to live by he's worthy of some
[43:56] substance and paul again this is in the
[43:58] image of the levites who served in the
[44:00] temple and there was an offering unto
[44:02] the lord that they partook and that gave
[44:04] them their substance to live by
[44:06] communicating to him that teacheth one
[44:08] who labors in the word and doctrine
[44:10] don't starve him don't deprive him the
[44:12] laborer is worthy of his reward
[44:16] first corinthians chapter 9 verses 13
[44:18] and 14 you'll find a lot in first
[44:20] corinthians chapter eight nine second
[44:21] corinthians there's a lot that refers to
[44:23] our christian giving i'm not going to
[44:25] have time to cover it today
[44:27] as much as i would like to
[44:29] and i'll i will acknowledge i'm thankful
[44:31] that the lord has been given such a
[44:32] comfort and i would say even a boldness
[44:34] to speak on that because in my complexes
[44:36] i would just leave it alone and never
[44:38] even mention it
[44:39] and uh and just say you know the people
[44:41] it's up to the people to give and
[44:43] they'll have to answer for the lord will
[44:44] provide church will make a way god will
[44:46] make away whatever it might be but i
[44:48] realize this is part of your worship
[44:51] it's important for you to understand
[44:52] these things and if it's if this kind of
[44:54] teaching makes you uncomfortable if you
[44:55] disagree with it i you know there's uh
[44:58] there's certainly a way that we could
[44:59] fellowship more on this subject matter
[45:01] and i would say that you'd be best to
[45:03] honor god and the conviction that you
[45:04] have
[45:06] but you be sure you're humbling yourself
[45:07] to the word of god
[45:09] be sure you're recognizing by revelation
[45:11] what the word teaches but first
[45:13] corinthians chapter 9 verses 13 to 14
[45:15] says do you not know that they which
[45:17] minister
[45:18] holy things
[45:20] temple what image is he wanting us to
[45:22] think about go back and read in first
[45:23] corinthians 9 find out what he's
[45:25] referring to
[45:26] he says you know that those that
[45:27] minister about holy things live of the
[45:30] things of the temple and they which wait
[45:32] at the altar are partakers with the
[45:34] altar
[45:35] even so hath the lord ordained that they
[45:37] which preach the gospel should live of
[45:40] the gospel
[45:41] there's a lot that's
[45:43] referenced in this first corinthians 9
[45:45] there's a lot
[45:46] but he's drawing again from the image of
[45:48] those that would minister in the temple
[45:50] those that would offer sacrifices at the
[45:52] altar that they were
[45:56] provided for in the old testament and
[45:58] therefore those that preach the gospel
[46:01] should live of the gospel or be
[46:02] beneficiaries of the gospel that is
[46:05] obeyed
[46:06] that the image paul is looking as this
[46:08] image of a tithe to a levite and how
[46:10] that the people the children of israel
[46:12] gave an offering unto the lord but the
[46:14] lord gave a portion that tenth to the
[46:16] levites to live off of and that was part
[46:19] of
[46:20] all is drawing from that part of the
[46:21] gospel part of our giving as christians
[46:23] is that we would give to those that
[46:25] teach those that communicate those that
[46:27] are faithful in the word of god because
[46:29] they are worthy of this reward and that
[46:31] they that preach the gospel are to ben
[46:34] from your obedience in the gospel
[46:37] and you see just in that these few
[46:39] moments that we're sharing on this
[46:41] that the levites
[46:44] are sharing
[46:46] that the image of the tithe to the
[46:47] levite
[46:48] is expressed in the new testament
[46:50] can you see do you see that hopefully
[46:52] you can see that in just the few
[46:53] scriptures we've we've used today
[47:03] now the next tithe was a tithe that's
[47:06] called for the annual festival and an
[47:09] annual feast but then also feast
[47:11] offerings
[47:12] this is where there is a distinction
[47:14] made
[47:15] and i think maybe you've heard it before
[47:17] a distinction made between what you give
[47:18] is tithing which would be the ten
[47:20] percent that we're all maybe conscious
[47:22] and aware of that you give ten percent
[47:25] uh as tithing to the ministry to the
[47:27] chur to the to the pastor to live off of
[47:30] but then the offering is something
[47:32] completely different
[47:34] complete completely separate from your
[47:36] tithing
[47:37] and so in the old testament there was a
[47:38] tithe for the levite and there's also
[47:41] tithe from the people as an offering and
[47:43] this
[47:44] is a type of the general offerings that
[47:47] are given by believers or by christians
[47:49] to if i can say maintain the church or
[47:51] for the function and service of the
[47:53] church itself
[47:54] not just the living of the ministry or
[47:56] the pastor
[47:58] and in deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 6
[48:00] there's and i will i'll even admit right
[48:03] now
[48:04] that there is
[48:05] to perhaps a uh oversimplification on my
[48:09] part
[48:10] on the old testament uh these old
[48:12] testament offerings i'm trying to just
[48:14] summarize them
[48:16] instead of getting very detailed there's
[48:17] a lot of other places we could have gone
[48:18] in numbers and a lot of other uh
[48:22] areas that we could have brought it out
[48:23] in but so if you say well brother this
[48:25] seems very over simplistic i'm trying to
[48:26] give more of a general overview
[48:29] instead of drilling down very deeply in
[48:31] each one of these offerings even the
[48:32] types and shadows and what they might
[48:34] represent
[48:35] deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 6 and says
[48:37] this ye shall bring your burnt offerings
[48:39] and your sacrifices and your tithes
[48:42] and heave offerings of your hand
[48:45] and your vows and your free will
[48:47] offerings and the first things of your
[48:50] herds and of your flocks you read this
[48:51] there's a lot in here that they're
[48:52] giving burnt offerings sacrifices tithes
[48:54] heave offerings vowels free will
[48:56] offerings and the first things of your
[48:57] herds and your flux aren't you glad you
[48:59] weren't a jew then
[49:00] right
[49:01] think of all the things that you had to
[49:03] give do you have your burn offering you
[49:04] have your sacrifice do you have your
[49:05] ties you have your heave offerings you
[49:06] have your vows you have a free offense
[49:07] oh i forgot the first things that i
[49:08] heard we got to go back
[49:11] there's a lot here
[49:12] that's expressed in terms of what an
[49:15] israelite would be giving but this is
[49:17] what god is asking for them to give
[49:20] under the law
[49:21] to
[49:23] his temple
[49:24] and as a as their worship
[49:29] to give and to do is you are to bring
[49:31] your burn offerings your sacrifice your
[49:33] tithes
[49:35] and your heave offerings of your hand
[49:37] your vows and your free will offerings
[49:40] i want you to see in the scripture let's
[49:42] look at deuteronomy chapter 16
[49:44] verses 16 and 17.
[49:47] three times in a year shall all thy
[49:49] males appear before the lord thy god
[49:51] in the place which he shall choose now
[49:53] notice this is
[49:54] three times a year
[49:56] in the feast of unleavened bread and the
[49:58] feast of weeks and the feast of
[50:00] tabernacles
[50:01] these are three different times of the
[50:02] year this is a very specific provision
[50:04] in the word of god as we looked in
[50:05] deuteronomy chapter 12
[50:07] bring your burnt offering sacrifice
[50:08] tithes heave offerings free will
[50:10] offerings first things of your flock
[50:11] this all to be brought and be put into
[50:12] the coffers given to the priests
[50:15] administered in worship
[50:17] uh and taken care of in the uh
[50:21] in the manner in which it was uh they're
[50:23] responsible for it so the three and it
[50:25] says
[50:26] three times in a year you're to do this
[50:29] feast of unleavened bread weeks
[50:30] tabernacles and they shall not appear
[50:33] before the lord empty
[50:36] so don't come to church empty-handed is
[50:38] what they're saying
[50:39] when they'd pass out offerings and and
[50:41] glass jar
[50:43] they would have these or trays and metal
[50:45] trays that was called silent offerings
[50:48] i mean no coin
[50:51] we want paper
[50:52] money and uh i i
[50:56] personally feel that mo a lot of people
[50:58] in this church are trying to i become
[51:00] origami experts because the way that
[51:02] dollar bills are folded
[51:05] it's like a puzzle
[51:07] how do we unfold this and so those who
[51:09] are counting the dollar bills
[51:10] and counting these things uh it takes
[51:13] that much longer when you go through
[51:14] every effort you can to twist and fold
[51:17] tightly that dollar bill or five dollar
[51:19] bill whatever it might be
[51:20] but they don't come empty-handed is
[51:22] what's saying right
[51:24] don't come before the lord empty every
[51:27] man shall give as he is able according
[51:30] to the blessing of the lord thy god
[51:31] which he have given thee
[51:33] this is the old testament expressing
[51:36] this too
[51:37] uh to the worshiper who's coming to the
[51:39] time what's he coming to the church the
[51:41] temple for to worship
[51:43] he's coming to perform his service he's
[51:45] coming to offer to the lord to give
[51:46] thanksgiving and he says when you come
[51:48] for these different feasts don't come
[51:50] empty-handed well what do i need to
[51:52] bring give as you are able according to
[51:54] the blessing which the lord thy god has
[51:57] as a free offering according to each
[51:59] person's measure
[52:01] and the more you could find the more
[52:02] blessed you were
[52:05] he's saying according to the measure of
[52:06] the blessing so the more blessed you are
[52:07] the more you gave
[52:11] there was a there was it was commiserate
[52:12] with it was responsive too i've been
[52:14] blessed i've been blessed i want to give
[52:15] more because god has blessed me this
[52:17] teaching in this is a shadow
[52:21] we can say oh well all these things were
[52:22] done away within the law so then
[52:25] you when you come to the new testament
[52:27] you start all over and you try to build
[52:28] it up again and say well paul says to do
[52:30] this and paul says to do that and it's
[52:32] in the very image of this so then what
[52:33] was this this was the shadow of what
[52:36] paul brings into substance that we as
[52:38] christians we want to give unto the lord
[52:41] as we are able according to the blessing
[52:43] which god hath given us and you'll find
[52:45] that paul uses that exact language
[52:51] this is different from the tithe of
[52:53] numbers 18.
[52:55] can we at least we can recognize that
[52:56] just by reading it right numbers 18 has
[52:59] its place the other places it's
[53:01] referenced in leviticus and different
[53:02] things there's a way that it's
[53:04] established but now he's saying you're
[53:05] going to come in the feast of unleavened
[53:06] bread the feast of weeks feast of
[53:08] tabernacles when you come don't be empty
[53:09] but give
[53:11] give as you're able
[53:13] so these are contributions
[53:16] that benefit more than just the priest
[53:19] these are contributions that well now
[53:20] here's my tenth to the lord i guess that
[53:22] levite is going to live off of it no
[53:24] these are things that are more than that
[53:26] and it's what we read about in
[53:27] deuteronomy chapter 14.
[53:29] so if you want to look back at
[53:30] deuteronomy chapter 14
[53:32] we'll read verses 22 to 27.
[53:39] this notice the specific tithe thou
[53:42] shalt truly tithe all the increase of
[53:44] thy seed that the field bringeth forth
[53:47] year by year
[53:49] and now it's the seed of the field and
[53:51] thou shalt eat before the lord thy god
[53:52] now who's eating you're gonna bring a
[53:54] tithe but now you're eating in the place
[53:56] which he shall choose to place his name
[53:58] there the tithe of thy corn and of thy
[54:00] wine and thy oil and the first things of
[54:02] thy herds and of thy flocks that thou
[54:05] mayest learn to fear the lord thy god
[54:06] always so this is the lesson in doing
[54:08] this
[54:09] tithe bring it to worship partake in it
[54:13] it's going to be to your benefit you're
[54:14] going to use it too and you're going to
[54:16] learn to fear the lord in doing it and
[54:18] at the way be too long for thee to bring
[54:20] corn and wine and oil and firstling so
[54:22] that thou art not able to carry it or if
[54:24] the place be too far from thee which the
[54:26] lord thy god shall choose to set his
[54:28] name there which what is it come on the
[54:30] temple the place of worship the place
[54:31] where god will put his name the place
[54:32] where the sacrifices are the place where
[54:34] god dwell when the lord thy god hath
[54:36] blessed thee
[54:37] says then thou shalt turn it into money
[54:40] and bind up the money in thy hand and
[54:41] shall go unto the place which the lord
[54:43] thy god shall choose so now the
[54:44] worshiper the offer is going to bring
[54:46] money
[54:48] and i shall bestow that money and you
[54:50] can see how what that turned into the
[54:51] day of jesus it says money for
[54:53] whatsoever thou soul desires a lust
[54:54] after oxen sheep wine strong drinker
[54:57] whatsoever thy soul desire and thou
[54:58] shalt eat there before the lord thy god
[55:01] and thou shalt rejoice thou in thy
[55:02] household so what is given is then
[55:05] translated is then used in the service
[55:08] in the worship in the place
[55:10] as a part of your worship and the levite
[55:12] that is within thy gates thou shalt not
[55:14] forsake him for he hath no part nor
[55:16] inheritance with thee
[55:19] so this is a different tithe
[55:22] than the tithing of numbers 18.
[55:26] so it's a tithe if you catch this it's
[55:28] the tithe of the remaining 90
[55:31] to be used in the worship of the temple
[55:33] so you have ten percent now you have
[55:35] nine percent
[55:36] that's why it's not exactly 30 right you
[55:38] follow me
[55:41] it's a tithing of the 90 that remains
[55:46] this is a free will this is a
[55:49] i i want to come to a free will offering
[55:51] but this is a
[55:53] explicit percentage that god is placing
[55:55] on it
[55:56] but it's in addition to the tithe to the
[55:59] levites for them to live off of and i
[56:01] want you to kind of recognize in its
[56:03] imagery we're not going to spend a lot
[56:04] of time kind of breaking it down because
[56:05] you could spend weeks just parsing
[56:07] through the details on these things that
[56:09] it was in the image of coming to what we
[56:11] would say we could say coming to church
[56:13] we're going to arrive at certain
[56:14] intervals we're going to come we're
[56:15] going to worship when i come i'm going
[56:16] to give something that can be used for
[56:18] the benefit of my household that's going
[56:20] to be used in the benefit of the service
[56:21] and used for those who are participating
[56:23] in it and this is the image of all those
[56:25] coming together to the tabernacle or to
[56:28] the temple to worship now notice this in
[56:31] exodus chapter 30
[56:33] this is a little bit of a different
[56:37] offering
[56:38] but i'm wanting to use this in this
[56:40] giving a separate giving
[56:42] that's to the function of the worship to
[56:44] the function of the temple
[56:46] and not just relate it to the levites
[56:48] themselves because there's a tie that's
[56:50] what i want you always as a tithe that
[56:51] the levites enjoyed but now there's a
[56:53] giving that's kind of more
[56:56] abroad to the participation of all in
[56:58] worship
[56:59] and exodus chapter 30 verses 11 to 16
[57:03] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[57:05] when thou take us the sum of the
[57:07] children of israel after their number
[57:09] this is a census tax essentially then
[57:11] the thou shalt then shall they give
[57:14] every man a ransom for his soul unto the
[57:16] lord when thou numbers them that there
[57:18] be no plague among them when thou
[57:21] numbers them now i'm just gonna i want
[57:22] you to be let's just be honest with the
[57:24] text
[57:25] as they do this census
[57:28] every man is going to have to pay a
[57:29] ransom for his soul so he's got to pay
[57:31] something
[57:32] to preserve his soul
[57:34] this they shall give everyone that
[57:37] passeth among them that are numbered
[57:39] half a shekel
[57:40] after the shekel of the sanctuary as
[57:42] sheckles 20 garas
[57:44] a half shekel shall be the offering of
[57:48] the lord
[57:49] every one that passeth among them that
[57:51] are numbered from 20 years old and above
[57:54] shall give an offering unto the lord
[57:57] this pertained to the males not to women
[57:59] and children and to strangers foreigners
[58:01] prosecutes any they were all included
[58:04] the males 20 years and above shall give
[58:06] an offering to the lord the rich shall
[58:07] not give more and the poor shall not
[58:09] give less than a half shekel when they
[58:11] give an offer to the lord to make an
[58:13] atonement for your souls
[58:15] now think about this
[58:17] this is
[58:20] uh god god who could preserve the
[58:23] curtains right god who could just put
[58:27] his heads of protection about the temple
[58:29] god who could just supernaturally give
[58:31] provision aaron's rod butted in the
[58:33] presence of the lord and
[58:35] bread is multiplied out by the hands of
[58:37] christ he caught he caused manna to fall
[58:39] out of heavens and quail and parted the
[58:41] red seas god could just preserve right
[58:44] god could just provide god could just
[58:46] anoint the levites they never get hungry
[58:48] they never go to bed the clothes never
[58:49] get dirty
[58:50] right there could have just been a way
[58:51] that god could have done it but somehow
[58:53] in his wisdom he did it so that there
[58:56] wouldn't be such a stark contrast
[58:58] between the those that offered the
[59:00] worship the the priest and the people
[59:02] that there would still be the same in
[59:05] affinity and connection and even
[59:07] offerings priests had to make were
[59:08] sometimes the very same ones for
[59:10] themselves the same ones that had to be
[59:11] offered by other people
[59:13] and it was it's a beautiful uh a program
[59:16] that god has ordained because in one
[59:18] hand he could have just said well i'll
[59:19] just make sure they're always debt-free
[59:21] well how is that going to happen or how
[59:22] i'm just going to make sure they're
[59:23] always provided for well this is how god
[59:25] provided it
[59:28] this is god's program this is his way
[59:32] and he says in that show verse 16 and
[59:34] thou shalt the atonement money of the
[59:36] children of israel
[59:37] it's atonement money for the children of
[59:39] israel and shall appoint it for the
[59:41] service of the tabernacle of the
[59:42] congregation that it may be a memorial
[59:44] under the children of israel before the
[59:45] lord to make an atonement for your souls
[59:49] what was in it what was it and to
[59:51] appoint it for the service of the
[59:52] tabernacle the half shekel that was to
[59:54] be paid as an offering unto the lord
[59:56] it's offered unto the lord well it's
[59:58] like well then just put it before the
[59:59] lord and let it stay there
[1:00:01] but no it's appointed for the service of
[1:00:03] the tabernacle it was an offering for
[1:00:05] the building of the tabernacle the
[1:00:07] repairs of the tabernacle the service in
[1:00:10] it and for the priests as they would
[1:00:11] need it it's an offering that is made
[1:00:14] for the service of the tabernacle
[1:00:18] and in the offering the giver is telling
[1:00:20] us that his life is preserved
[1:00:23] as an atonement for his soul
[1:00:25] that there would that there would be no
[1:00:27] plague among them
[1:00:29] so it's an offering that benefited the
[1:00:31] giver
[1:00:33] you recognize that that's what that's
[1:00:35] what they're alluding to is there
[1:00:36] as a ransom for his soul that there be
[1:00:38] no plague among them as a ransom for his
[1:00:40] soul as a ransom for his soul is
[1:00:41] atonement for his souls atonement for
[1:00:42] his soul
[1:00:44] the image is
[1:00:45] the benefit that the giver receives but
[1:00:47] he's also the lord and they'll take that
[1:00:50] for the benefit of the tabernacle
[1:00:52] because believe it or not the tabernacle
[1:01:01] salt it needed garments for the priest
[1:01:04] you ever think about that
[1:01:06] there's a lot that went into making sure
[1:01:08] the tabernacle was working
[1:01:13] it's an image of these offerings
[1:01:16] that we see in mark chapter 12 verses 4
[1:01:20] it says that jesus sat over against the
[1:01:22] treasury and behold how the people cast
[1:01:25] money
[1:01:27] and the court of
[1:01:28] describe it uh in some places there was
[1:01:31] these urns
[1:01:33] of these deposit trees called treasuries
[1:01:36] and that people would come to the temple
[1:01:37] and they would put their donation their
[1:01:39] money actually into the treasury another
[1:01:42] established for certain types of
[1:01:45] casting
[1:01:47] widow
[1:01:49] and she threw in two mites which make a
[1:01:51] farthing
[1:01:52] and he called unto him his disciples
[1:01:56] and saith unto them verily i say unto
[1:01:57] you that this poor woman hath cast more
[1:02:00] in
[1:02:02] than all they which have cast into the
[1:02:03] treasury
[1:02:04] now certainly there's a paradox on the
[1:02:07] face of it that if she just threw in a
[1:02:09] farthing or two mites and some are
[1:02:10] giving a lot more how is it that she's
[1:02:12] given more and he says for all they did
[1:02:14] cast of their abundance in of their
[1:02:15] abundance but she her aunt did cast in
[1:02:19] all that she had in her punery in her
[1:02:21] poverty she of her want did cast in all
[1:02:23] that she had even all her living
[1:02:28] and jesus takes no
[1:02:29] exception to this
[1:02:31] his commentary isn't what a waste
[1:02:34] what a waste they've made this place a
[1:02:36] den of thieves and this is all going to
[1:02:37] be destroyed
[1:02:39] and and very soon anyways and pretty
[1:02:41] soon the blood is going to be exposed
[1:02:42] the altar is going to be exposed exposed
[1:02:44] as bloodless he doesn't have an attitude
[1:02:47] towards it at all he's saying that this
[1:02:48] woman has given more than the others
[1:02:50] he's looking at this worship under the
[1:02:52] law which is in effect even at this time
[1:02:54] and he sees the rich come in and give in
[1:02:56] a lot and this widow comes and just
[1:02:58] gives in uh two mice which makes a
[1:02:59] farthing and and says this woman is
[1:03:02] given more because she's given from her
[1:03:03] poverty
[1:03:06] and all of her living he says this but
[1:03:07] what's actually happening and maybe not
[1:03:10] a butt but uh in the image that he's
[1:03:12] describing is this treasury that was set
[1:03:15] up in the temple received voluntary
[1:03:16] contributions people are coming to
[1:03:18] worship
[1:03:19] and as the worshipers came to the feast
[1:03:21] there was these receptacles in which
[1:03:22] they could place voluntary offerings
[1:03:24] there was actually places where they
[1:03:26] would place mandatory offerings there
[1:03:28] were 13 treasuries or these urns and
[1:03:30] they shaped a certain way in the court
[1:03:32] of women that received old shekel dues
[1:03:34] new checkl
[1:03:36] offerings and different things that
[1:03:38] needed to be given
[1:03:39] some of these uh
[1:03:42] treasuries received offerings that a
[1:03:43] worshiper legally owed that
[1:03:47] must give this
[1:03:49] but then there were others that received
[1:03:51] voluntary gifts and i found where the
[1:03:53] numbers changed a little bit as i was
[1:03:54] reading through the bible so i wasn't
[1:03:56] quite sure how to nail it down but there
[1:03:57] were some that they would give of their
[1:03:59] compelled
[1:04:00] legally obligated under the law
[1:04:02] offerings but then there was others that
[1:04:04] received voluntary gifts as we read a
[1:04:06] moment ago your free will offerings
[1:04:08] there's a place for your free will
[1:04:09] offerings and there was also a place
[1:04:11] where a man who would appear before and
[1:04:13] and if you're appearing before the lord
[1:04:14] he does not come
[1:04:15] he gives us he is able jesus is most
[1:04:18] likely referring to this kind of giving
[1:04:20] where the rich who are very blessed gave
[1:04:22] as they were able as they were according
[1:04:24] to the blessing which the lord had given
[1:04:25] them and the woman that she gave even in
[1:04:27] her poverty
[1:04:30] it was these places where these
[1:04:31] offerings were made
[1:04:34] and again the offerings are used to buy
[1:04:35] wood
[1:04:36] for the sacrifices oil and other
[1:04:38] necessities and supplies for the proper
[1:04:41] service in the temple
[1:04:43] and these are all
[1:04:46] types of the free will offerings we give
[1:04:48] as christians to the church for its
[1:04:49] function
[1:04:52] i say in the bible there's a specific
[1:04:54] place for tithing that would go to the
[1:04:55] ministry
[1:04:56] and then also in the old testament and
[1:04:58] then in the old testament there's also a
[1:04:59] place for this offering free will
[1:05:01] offerings the in the in the old times it
[1:05:03] was even a tie that's given that's
[1:05:05] related to the service to the special
[1:05:07] meeting
[1:05:08] to the worship in the temple
[1:05:11] i want to go to the tithe for the poor
[1:05:14] and then come back to some new testament
[1:05:15] scriptures i think that have application
[1:05:17] a little bit to this tithe for the feast
[1:05:20] for the tabernacle for the temple
[1:05:22] it's a tithe for the poor
[1:05:24] and the old testament these are
[1:05:25] offerings for the for the needs of the
[1:05:27] people
[1:05:28] again i would say that this is in the
[1:05:29] image of archiving domitians which i
[1:05:31] would encourage giving to missions
[1:05:33] an example of our special offerings when
[1:05:35] we take up for a specific need in the
[1:05:38] church or certain uh maybe there's a
[1:05:39] fund that you keep that it's a
[1:05:41] benevolence fund that you give to those
[1:05:43] that are needy
[1:05:44] but this is a type of giving
[1:05:47] old testament which was a tithe for the
[1:05:49] poor now if you're doing math
[1:05:51] these are three
[1:05:53] we're arriving at three different ten
[1:05:55] percents
[1:05:56] there's a map you can say 10
[1:05:59] 9
[1:06:00] and then and then you add on to that to
[1:06:02] where you could come up with maybe a 27
[1:06:04] but if you add it all out over the years
[1:06:06] as they say well you're going to do this
[1:06:08] percent one year this percent another
[1:06:09] year it basically averages up to 23.3
[1:06:12] percent every year
[1:06:13] that an israelite would be giving
[1:06:16] in their mandatory tithe
[1:06:19] to
[1:06:20] the lord
[1:06:21] this doesn't even include free will
[1:06:23] offerings
[1:06:24] so that's not the big reveal that's not
[1:06:25] the new adjusted number
[1:06:28] i'm just saying this is what really if
[1:06:29] you want to get down to it you want to
[1:06:30] really dig into it and find out what
[1:06:32] what the tithe was and how much was
[1:06:34] given this is what an israelite was
[1:06:35] giving
[1:06:36] they knew on average 23.3 percent of the
[1:06:39] year they were giving
[1:06:40] three 23.3 percent of their increase
[1:06:43] they were going to be giving back to the
[1:06:44] lord now they didn't they wouldn't do it
[1:06:47] thinking oh great they would do it
[1:06:48] knowing it came with a promise
[1:06:50] came with the blessing and so then there
[1:06:51] was on top of that free will offerings
[1:06:54] that were given
[1:06:56] now this tithe for the poor we find back
[1:06:58] in deuteronomy chapter 14
[1:07:00] verses 28 and 29
[1:07:02] again this is different from the tithe
[1:07:04] to the levites
[1:07:05] and this is different from the offerings
[1:07:07] that we read about in exodus 30 the
[1:07:09] offerings in deuteronomy 16 chapter 12
[1:07:12] from the offerings referenced in that
[1:07:14] and it's different from what he has just
[1:07:17] described in verses 22 to 27 the tithe
[1:07:20] of all their increase that they're going
[1:07:21] to come and bring into the place where
[1:07:22] they're going to worship because now
[1:07:24] it's in a different interval
[1:07:26] at the end of fear thou shalt bring
[1:07:28] forth all the tithe of thy increase the
[1:07:30] same year and shall lay it up within thy
[1:07:32] gates and the levite because he hath no
[1:07:34] part nor inheritance with thee and the
[1:07:36] stranger and the fatherless and the
[1:07:38] widow which are within thy gate shall
[1:07:40] come and shall eat and be satisfied
[1:07:44] that the lord thy god may bless thee in
[1:07:46] all the work of thine hand which thou
[1:07:48] doest
[1:07:49] once again this is a tithe or an
[1:07:51] offering that is separate and apart from
[1:07:53] the tithe that they would give to the
[1:07:55] levites it's also different than the
[1:07:57] increase that they would give in those
[1:07:59] other years uh that they would
[1:08:01] participate in and enjoy on the festival
[1:08:04] and then also different from the free
[1:08:06] will offerings or even from the
[1:08:09] because these things are all different
[1:08:11] but now it's something that's going to
[1:08:13] benefit others
[1:08:15] the fatherless the widow the stranger
[1:08:19] and it comes with the promise again that
[1:08:21] the lord thy god may bless thee and all
[1:08:23] the work of thy hand
[1:08:25] which
[1:08:26] thou
[1:08:27] doest
[1:08:28] that there's a blessing that comes with
[1:08:30] that
[1:08:32] that if you're giving and you look at
[1:08:33] this way now we said there's three
[1:08:34] different tithes and we do it just in
[1:08:36] deuteronomy 14 and numbers 18 these
[1:08:38] three different tithes would uh the 10
[1:08:40] percent the 10 percent of 90 the 10
[1:08:43] uh then of 81 and you come you arrive at
[1:08:46] this mathematically you come to what
[1:08:48] their percentage would be he's saying in
[1:08:50] all this if you do these things i'm
[1:08:51] going to bless you that the lord may god
[1:08:53] may bless thee in all the work of thy
[1:08:55] hand which thou doest
[1:08:57] and again
[1:08:59] again it's different from the festival
[1:09:00] offerings the free will offerings the
[1:09:02] annual feast offering the levite
[1:09:04] offerings but this tithe for the poor
[1:09:08] i want you to recognize just in the
[1:09:09] verbiage that we've read here it's a
[1:09:11] given that benefits the needs of other
[1:09:13] people beyond
[1:09:14] just the worshiper himself
[1:09:17] or the temple service or the temple
[1:09:18] function
[1:09:20] it's to benefit so that those the
[1:09:21] fathers the widow those within the gates
[1:09:23] and the stranger can come and
[1:09:25] participate and benefit from it
[1:09:27] and the new testament is very explicit
[1:09:29] in this that commands this type of
[1:09:31] giving form for a christian
[1:09:34] it's a type of giving that paul is
[1:09:36] emphasizing that's beyond the support to
[1:09:38] the minister beyond just the support of
[1:09:40] the church
[1:09:42] and romans chapter 12 verse 13 it says
[1:09:43] distributing to the necessity of the
[1:09:45] saints given to hospitality this is a
[1:09:47] commandment not just to a
[1:09:48] pastor someone in an office but this is
[1:09:50] to all of us he's encouraging the romans
[1:09:52] to distribute to the necessity of the
[1:09:56] saints
[1:09:57] he says in first timothy chapter 6 verse
[1:09:59] 18
[1:10:00] that they do good that they be
[1:10:02] they be rich in good works ready to
[1:10:05] distribute willing to communicate which
[1:10:08] is communicate means to share in your
[1:10:10] increase
[1:10:11] to to give a portion of your means
[1:10:14] this is what paul was telling timothy to
[1:10:16] teach people to do to do good be rich in
[1:10:18] good works be ready to distribute
[1:10:20] distribute to the necessity of the
[1:10:21] saints ready to distribute willing to
[1:10:23] communicate this is we could say this is
[1:10:25] mandatory
[1:10:27] right
[1:10:29] paul it just when you say mandatory in
[1:10:31] the light of the new testament in the
[1:10:32] light of grace that this is it has a
[1:10:35] different language and a different tenor
[1:10:37] than it does in the old testament but
[1:10:39] paul when he's writing these things that
[1:10:40] fathers uh fathers don't provoke your
[1:10:43] children to anger that's a commandment
[1:10:45] that's mandatory that's something the
[1:10:47] father should say i want to do this
[1:10:48] husbands love your wives and children
[1:10:51] honor your father and thy mother and you
[1:10:52] look at all these commandments this is
[1:10:54] in the same vein
[1:10:56] in the same vein that we would wash one
[1:10:58] another's feet and take communion it's
[1:11:00] telling us to distribute be ready to
[1:11:02] communicate
[1:11:04] in acts chapter 20 verse 35 paul
[1:11:07] references something that you can't find
[1:11:09] anywhere else paul said he said it i
[1:11:12] showed you all things
[1:11:14] had that so labor and you ought to
[1:11:15] support the weak
[1:11:17] and to remember the words of the lord
[1:11:18] how he said it is more blessed to give
[1:11:20] than to receive
[1:11:22] paul said remember i've taught you that
[1:11:23] in your labor and you're working and
[1:11:25] your increases you get things support
[1:11:27] the weak
[1:11:29] there's more images of this in the old
[1:11:30] testament
[1:11:32] and we may not be gleaning and feel we
[1:11:34] may not be harvesting crops and be able
[1:11:35] to leave the corners for the stranger
[1:11:37] and then for the widow and the
[1:11:38] impoverished but there's a way that paul
[1:11:40] carries this idea over and says as you
[1:11:42] labor
[1:11:43] and as you gain means support the weak
[1:11:47] the very image of deuteronomy 14 28-29
[1:11:49] that there's a giving there's an
[1:11:50] offering there's a tithe that the weak
[1:11:52] the fatherless the widow and the
[1:11:54] stranger would benefit from he says
[1:11:56] support the weak he says and he draws it
[1:11:58] back to something that jesus said it is
[1:12:00] more blessed to give than to receive
[1:12:04] is to provoke inside of us this
[1:12:06] christian character if you have the
[1:12:07] baptism the holy ghost the giver of
[1:12:09] gifts the giver of life the one who is
[1:12:11] the giver the offer the lord himself is
[1:12:13] there's his natures inside of you to
[1:12:16] unloose this unselfishness and to lose
[1:12:18] this giving the sacrificing nature and
[1:12:20] know that you're more blessed in giving
[1:12:23] than receiving
[1:12:25] and just as this
[1:12:26] this poor widow cast in her two mites
[1:12:30] there was a she was giving but she's
[1:12:32] blessed in her giving because she's
[1:12:33] going to receive from the lord
[1:12:36] the greater blessing and given in
[1:12:37] galatians 2 10 only they that would
[1:12:40] only they would that we should remember
[1:12:42] the poor
[1:12:43] tell us we should remember before the
[1:12:44] same which i also was forward to do
[1:12:47] we ought to remember the poor the the
[1:12:49] needy support the weak ready to
[1:12:51] distribute to the necessity of the
[1:12:53] saints willing to communicate this is
[1:12:55] the function of the new testament truth
[1:12:57] right
[1:13:00] if you if you see it in the scripture
[1:13:01] you agree you're certainly welcome to
[1:13:03] say amen
[1:13:04] i'll take that as a i'll take that as an
[1:13:06] offering today okay
[1:13:07] i'll take that as a reward
[1:13:09] and hebrews chapter 13 verse 16 but to
[1:13:12] do good
[1:13:15] again
[1:13:15] to share your means communicate forgive
[1:13:19] for with such sacrifices god
[1:13:21] is well pleased
[1:13:24] it's telling us that this idea of doing
[1:13:26] good that they be rich in good works and
[1:13:29] to do good is probably
[1:13:30] beyond maybe just living in such a way
[1:13:33] to we come off as righteous and pious
[1:13:35] and abstaining but it probably has
[1:13:36] something to do with overt acts that
[1:13:38] encourage somebody else
[1:13:40] recognizes a need fills a gap supports
[1:13:44] with such sacrifices god is well pleased
[1:13:47] i would say that this is obviously not
[1:13:49] mandatory by law
[1:13:52] but i believe a believer is compelled by
[1:13:54] grace
[1:13:56] to do these things
[1:13:57] within their means as they are able
[1:14:00] and let me point out too a lot of times
[1:14:02] we're just thinking in terms of money so
[1:14:04] someone's in their head saying well okay
[1:14:05] if i have to do 23.3 percent of my
[1:14:07] paycheck i've got a budget this is going
[1:14:09] to crash everything it's going to ruin
[1:14:10] there goes my dreams of uh owning my own
[1:14:12] house which i think that ship seems to
[1:14:15] be selling very quickly here in phoenix
[1:14:17] anyways
[1:14:19] but
[1:14:21] this calculation in terms of money
[1:14:23] hey that's a part of it right
[1:14:26] in your giving and that may be what we
[1:14:28] what we give when we pass the offering
[1:14:30] plate i haven't seen anybody drop an
[1:14:32] ipad in there or at least a tenth of one
[1:14:34] or
[1:14:35] somebody putting in a handful of corn
[1:14:37] uh just just origami that maybe you sell
[1:14:39] at a trade fair i don't know but we're
[1:14:42] giving money but you realize you can
[1:14:44] give a lot more than just your money
[1:14:46] there's people in this church that have
[1:14:47] resources that could be used
[1:14:50] by this church there's people that have
[1:14:52] and i'm again i'm not talking about
[1:14:53] money there's people in this church have
[1:14:54] talents and abilities and minds and
[1:14:56] attitudes that can be a benefit
[1:14:59] in the church
[1:15:00] that we can serve there's ways that you
[1:15:01] can give to where you're distributing
[1:15:03] the necessity of the saints rich and
[1:15:04] good works ready to distribute willing
[1:15:06] to communicate to support the weak to be
[1:15:08] blessed in giving to communicate and to
[1:15:10] do good these sacrifices don't always
[1:15:13] relate to
[1:15:14] money
[1:15:17] and there's ways that you can be
[1:15:18] compelled by grace to give and to serve
[1:15:20] and to make it as an offering unto the
[1:15:22] lord and it counts with god as a
[1:15:23] sacrifice
[1:15:25] being compelled by grace to do it
[1:15:27] i remember one time i was aware of a
[1:15:29] situation that's kind of actually
[1:15:30] involved a little bit in a situation
[1:15:32] where a church had a need of something
[1:15:34] being done at the church and it was an
[1:15:36] ongoing need a very expensive need there
[1:15:38] happened to be somebody in the church
[1:15:39] who that was their profession
[1:15:41] that's what they did for a living and
[1:15:43] they actually had they actually worked
[1:15:45] right next door to the church i thought
[1:15:47] well you know what i just call the
[1:15:48] person and see if maybe they would be
[1:15:50] able to assist the church in this need
[1:15:53] and i called them up and i said what
[1:15:54] about this and the answer was no i don't
[1:15:56] have a burden for that
[1:15:59] and and it was in that that i realized
[1:16:01] some people don't even realize what a
[1:16:02] burden is
[1:16:04] they think well i'm only going to do it
[1:16:06] if i not even be able to be happy with
[1:16:07] myself and i guess i got to give this
[1:16:09] because i'm so burdened and you just do
[1:16:11] it to relieve yourself of this anxiety
[1:16:13] or this pounding headache oh i guess i'm
[1:16:16] going to have to be nice to somebody
[1:16:17] today
[1:16:18] i guess i'm gonna have to help somebody
[1:16:19] no burdens there's burdens that are
[1:16:23] by god and there's burdens you pick up
[1:16:26] we see that in the scripture there's
[1:16:28] burns in which someone's being bowed
[1:16:29] down and weighed down there's burdens
[1:16:30] that are your responsibility and there's
[1:16:32] other burdens that were asked to bear
[1:16:33] when you see a burden you see a need in
[1:16:35] the church and you say oh well i don't
[1:16:37] have that bird and the lord hasn't put
[1:16:38] it on my heart maybe he's wanting you to
[1:16:39] take it and put it there
[1:16:42] we're all we're looking for the lord to
[1:16:43] put it on my heart put it on my heart
[1:16:44] lord i want something to do and he's
[1:16:45] saying well
[1:16:46] here it is but what he wanted him to do
[1:16:49] is maybe super supernatural do something
[1:16:51] but if it's there's ways that we could
[1:16:53] take burdens on our heart there's needs
[1:16:55] that maybe we can fill and some may be
[1:16:57] more blessed in areas that are more
[1:16:59] financial and then god wants them to
[1:17:02] give of their increase there may be
[1:17:03] others that are able to serve and
[1:17:05] perform services and do functions to
[1:17:07] give but let's give let's be givers
[1:17:10] let's be unselfish
[1:17:12] i covered it last year through a number
[1:17:13] of different ways and nobody ever made a
[1:17:15] comment about it but i was very
[1:17:16] deliberate through a number of different
[1:17:18] services to go along the lines of a
[1:17:20] theme of serving being unselfish
[1:17:24] giving and making ourselves available
[1:17:26] you can even go back to where the
[1:17:28] bride's advocacy is about being servants
[1:17:32] about serving others
[1:17:34] now to this and i think these i'm using
[1:17:37] these in the application of tithing to
[1:17:38] the poor but it certainly is akin to the
[1:17:41] believer's free will offerings for the
[1:17:44] service of the church but the needs of
[1:17:45] others also
[1:17:47] paul refers to it in first corinthians
[1:17:48] chapter 16 verses one and two this is a
[1:17:51] habit of the new testament church
[1:17:53] now concerning the collection for the
[1:17:55] saints
[1:17:58] as i have given order to the churches of
[1:18:00] galatia even so do ye as i have told the
[1:18:02] churches in galatia to take up an
[1:18:04] offering
[1:18:05] upon the first day of the week let every
[1:18:07] one of you lay by him in store as god
[1:18:09] hath prospered him
[1:18:11] that there be no gatherings when i come
[1:18:13] in others you gather you make your
[1:18:14] collection on the first of the week
[1:18:16] tells us that they gathered the first
[1:18:17] day of the week this is their custom the
[1:18:18] new testament they had their gatherings
[1:18:20] they had church
[1:18:21] as god had prospered the individual they
[1:18:23] would give
[1:18:25] he says do this for the distribution for
[1:18:27] the saints so that when i come we're not
[1:18:29] having to pull for offerings and we're
[1:18:30] not have to take up an offering
[1:18:32] what is it it's a collection
[1:18:35] it's people giving their money this
[1:18:36] would be the giving actually giving
[1:18:38] of a substance
[1:18:41] of means
[1:18:42] for the benefit and use of the saints
[1:18:45] again i'd say it's a it's akin to the
[1:18:48] tithe
[1:18:49] for the poor
[1:18:51] now do you see that
[1:18:53] in the least to some degree i would ask
[1:18:57] before we want you to ponder this i'm
[1:18:58] not necessarily asking for a verbal
[1:19:00] response or a q a on this
[1:19:03] but can you see then in the old
[1:19:05] testament and i know i've been very
[1:19:06] simplistic and trying to reference it
[1:19:08] that there was more let's just say this
[1:19:10] there was more tithe than just 10 to the
[1:19:12] priest
[1:19:13] there's more giving there's more
[1:19:14] offerings
[1:19:15] the half shekel the free will offerings
[1:19:17] the treasury
[1:19:18] the offering of the festivals the
[1:19:20] offering at the feast there was
[1:19:21] certainly a lot more that some would
[1:19:23] give
[1:19:25] than just the tithe to the priest
[1:19:27] and then just by going over it very
[1:19:29] quickly and trying to fit all this into
[1:19:30] one service do you see then that paul's
[1:19:32] using the image of those things
[1:19:34] and communicating to him that teacheth
[1:19:36] the ox is worthy of his hire some people
[1:19:39] say they use that analogy to to just
[1:19:42] call the preacher an ox or a beast
[1:19:44] i guess we don't want to muzzle you
[1:19:45] you're good for you i guess you should
[1:19:47] eat
[1:19:48] but there's free will offerings and all
[1:19:49] the things mentioned in the old
[1:19:51] testament paul is using the very image
[1:19:53] of those things a tithe to the poor
[1:19:54] collection for the saints distributing
[1:19:56] those that are needy
[1:19:58] the same burden then the same not in the
[1:20:02] same sense that the law was mandatory
[1:20:03] but now in our liberty as christians
[1:20:06] there's things that we ought to be
[1:20:07] compelled to do by grace to serve and to
[1:20:09] give and it exists in the same framework
[1:20:11] of the tithes of the old testament
[1:20:14] in question and answers this is in 1961
[1:20:17] it's question 161 he's asked the brother
[1:20:19] brahms to ask the question would it be
[1:20:21] wrong to use tithes on church building
[1:20:23] funds
[1:20:25] is that a good question
[1:20:30] then
[1:20:31] it was touching he says no correctly
[1:20:33] tithes
[1:20:34] go to the minister
[1:20:37] so now
[1:20:38] a
[1:20:39] very deliberate to
[1:20:41] answer the question and i think that
[1:20:42] sometimes we need to pause when there's
[1:20:44] a question and there's an answer if the
[1:20:46] question seems maybe a little bit
[1:20:48] different and we think oh my that's so
[1:20:50] different think about the fact that he's
[1:20:52] answering a specific person's question
[1:20:55] not necessarily yours
[1:20:56] so he has to answer i believe even the
[1:20:58] lord would lead him to answer that
[1:21:00] question in such a way to respond to the
[1:21:02] need in that person's heart
[1:21:04] and then it's instructed to us also so
[1:21:06] we want to kind of catch the thought
[1:21:07] behind it not just cabbage down on the
[1:21:09] verbiage but he says no the tithes go to
[1:21:11] the minister so this person is obviously
[1:21:13] thinking about maybe the 10
[1:21:14] that would be given to the ministry can
[1:21:16] we use it for just anything for church
[1:21:17] building funds no it goes to the
[1:21:19] minister then he points back says in the
[1:21:21] bible they had a box that they said at
[1:21:22] the door the old testament when building
[1:21:24] this box was a fun when people would put
[1:21:26] in there for the repairing you've seen
[1:21:27] it many times in the old testament they
[1:21:28] kept up buildings and things like that
[1:21:30] all the repairs in the building was
[1:21:31] taken care of out of that fund
[1:21:34] but all the tithing went to the priest
[1:21:37] they're pastors yes tithing's to go for
[1:21:39] nothing else so brother branham
[1:21:41] answering this and what has he done he's
[1:21:43] in between
[1:21:44] and offerings
[1:21:47] obviously to the the livelihood of the
[1:21:49] ministry but then there's also givings
[1:21:51] that go to the repair of the building to
[1:21:54] be taken out of that fund and if we
[1:21:55] drill down in some of the church order
[1:21:56] you'll find that trustees are
[1:21:58] responsible for administering the
[1:22:00] finances of the church to upkeep the
[1:22:02] building
[1:22:03] and the things related to the building
[1:22:05] itself and not the preaching of the word
[1:22:07] he says i know people take their tithes
[1:22:09] and give them to a widow woman that's
[1:22:10] wrong
[1:22:12] listen this is very important for us to
[1:22:13] listen to if you've got anything to give
[1:22:15] the widow woman give her but don't give
[1:22:17] her god's money
[1:22:19] that's not yours in the first place
[1:22:21] that's gods
[1:22:24] but victor you might remember but
[1:22:26] brother bernie used to teach on it that
[1:22:28] when you've given your ten percent by
[1:22:30] the bernie garcia
[1:22:31] which i'm just going to confess this
[1:22:32] publicly i was fashion with the pastor
[1:22:34] of the day and i accidentally called him
[1:22:35] brother bernie sanders
[1:22:38] and i'm never going to be able to live
[1:22:39] it down and now it's on the internet
[1:22:42] but brother bernie garcia used to teach
[1:22:43] that once you've given your 10 percent
[1:22:45] you still haven't given god anything
[1:22:46] because that was his
[1:22:49] that's a good way of thinking about it
[1:22:51] or you could just look at it it's all
[1:22:52] god's and it's the first thing he's
[1:22:54] asking for is 10 back
[1:22:56] so you still have a responsibility for
[1:22:57] the 90.
[1:22:58] he says so when you give that tithe and
[1:23:00] you give it to the widow one he says
[1:23:02] that's god's money
[1:23:05] that's not yours in the first place
[1:23:07] that's god's so he gives an example so
[1:23:09] we could really tune into this if you
[1:23:10] sent me downtown to get a loaf of bread
[1:23:11] and you give me 25 cents to get bread
[1:23:13] and i met somebody on the street that
[1:23:15] wanted something else and i give him 25
[1:23:17] cents i give them your money if they ask
[1:23:20] me for something let them get it over
[1:23:22] here in this pocket and give them my
[1:23:24] money
[1:23:25] but there's 10 of your increase if you
[1:23:27] want to say your salary your gross your
[1:23:28] net whatever it is whatever it is in
[1:23:30] your heart that you believe to be that
[1:23:31] 10 that you go oh to the lord he says
[1:23:34] but this
[1:23:35] he says this is your money and a tenth
[1:23:37] of it is the lord's
[1:23:39] whatever pocket he's looking into you
[1:23:41] got this money over here that's the 25
[1:23:42] cents for the loaf of bread that goat is
[1:23:44] the lord this other one this is your
[1:23:46] money but a tenth of it is the lord's
[1:23:48] and the levi the priest could live by
[1:23:50] the tenth
[1:23:51] the tenth is to be a tithe and that's to
[1:23:53] be brought into the storehouse with the
[1:23:54] promised of god to bless it and a proof
[1:23:57] he said if you don't believe it come and
[1:24:00] prove me and see if it won't do it
[1:24:03] that's right tithings go into the church
[1:24:06] for the pastor and so forth like that to
[1:24:08] live on and then the building funds and
[1:24:10] things like that are a separate fund all
[1:24:13] together
[1:24:14] what is brother banh teaching us
[1:24:16] that there's a difference between the
[1:24:17] tithe that you owe to the lord
[1:24:20] and there's and the tithe
[1:24:22] or the giving that would be to the
[1:24:24] upkeep of the church
[1:24:26] the expenses of
[1:24:30] the pain of rent and utilities and those
[1:24:32] things he says that's a separate fund
[1:24:34] all together
[1:24:36] he references malachi chapter 3 verses 6
[1:24:39] to 11. let's read it together
[1:24:41] if you want to look here
[1:24:49] i know i know it may be a long
[1:24:54] maybe lengthy
[1:24:56] this morning but i was told that uh
[1:24:58] we're not eating to a particular time
[1:25:00] anyways they're not gonna go pick up the
[1:25:01] rest of the food
[1:25:03] until 12 45
[1:25:05] so
[1:25:06] instead of us all just standing around
[1:25:08] with our stomachs growling out in the
[1:25:10] heat well let's just sit let's just sit
[1:25:12] here for a little bit longer
[1:25:14] take our time to go over this whatever i
[1:25:15] don't finish i'm just going to pick up
[1:25:16] in the meeting
[1:25:18] and uh and and share some things with
[1:25:20] you because there's a lot of statements
[1:25:22] that i have here before me that i don't
[1:25:23] know if i'm going to get to
[1:25:24] when brother bram says here the tithes
[1:25:26] and the tithing belong to the pastor
[1:25:30] they go to the minister and for nothing
[1:25:31] else
[1:25:33] he addresses even
[1:25:35] whether or not it would be appropriate
[1:25:36] to take tithes and give it to his
[1:25:38] ministry he says no you're not to do
[1:25:41] that
[1:25:42] he tells us where it's to go to your
[1:25:44] church to where you're being fed
[1:25:46] so in malachi chapter 3 verses 6 to 11
[1:25:48] for i am the lord i change not therefore
[1:25:49] you sons of jacob are not consumed even
[1:25:52] from the days of your father's you're
[1:25:53] gone away from mine ordinances and have
[1:25:55] not kept them return unto me and i'll
[1:25:57] return unto you saith the lord of hosts
[1:25:58] but you said where and shall we return
[1:26:00] like
[1:26:01] what do we need to start doing what is
[1:26:03] it we're not doing
[1:26:04] will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me
[1:26:07] but you say when have we robbed thee
[1:26:09] in tithes and offerings there's a
[1:26:11] plurality here
[1:26:13] why is there a plurality because there
[1:26:14] was more than just one tithe to the
[1:26:16] levites there was other tithes and
[1:26:17] there's other offerings beyond that
[1:26:19] you are cursed with the curse why for
[1:26:21] you've robbed me
[1:26:23] he says even this whole nation and i i
[1:26:26] know the construct of it is that maybe
[1:26:28] you've maybe the whole nation has robbed
[1:26:30] god but you robbed the nation too
[1:26:33] the nation is robbed as brother ram said
[1:26:35] earlier that when the people couldn't
[1:26:36] give he was robbing the people so you
[1:26:38] rob god when you don't give but you're
[1:26:40] robbing yourself you're robbing the
[1:26:42] church you robbed the nation when you
[1:26:43] fail to do these things so he says bring
[1:26:45] you all the tithes into the storehouse
[1:26:48] that's the treasuries it's the
[1:26:49] receptacle set up in the tabernacle and
[1:26:51] the temple there for people to bring
[1:26:53] their grain offerings to bring their
[1:26:54] heave offerings to bring their tithe to
[1:26:56] bring their free will offerings bring
[1:26:57] them all into the storehouse that there
[1:26:58] may be meat in my house says improve me
[1:27:01] now herewith prove me with your
[1:27:03] offerings prove me with your tithes
[1:27:04] saith the lord of hosts if i will not
[1:27:06] open you the windows of heaven and pour
[1:27:09] you out a blessing that there shall not
[1:27:11] be room enough to receive it
[1:27:14] as we're reading in these other places
[1:27:16] that the lord thy god may bless thee and
[1:27:18] all thy work of thy hand which thou
[1:27:20] doest is he says that thy barns will be
[1:27:22] filled with plenty and thy presses shall
[1:27:23] burst out with new wine that there is a
[1:27:26] there is a if there's an equal response
[1:27:28] if god has blessed me and i pour out
[1:27:31] in an offering of giving back to the
[1:27:34] lord you've increased the measure by
[1:27:36] which god can bless you again
[1:27:39] i think it's billy graham that said that
[1:27:41] we lived much
[1:27:43] we could make 90 percent go much further
[1:27:48] and do more for us than the 100 percent
[1:27:51] of 100 percent
[1:27:54] that in that giving of the tithe alone
[1:27:57] and in that sacrifice which god says
[1:27:59] these are the sacrifices of god that
[1:28:01] please these are sacrifices that please
[1:28:03] god that you'll do more
[1:28:06] with less
[1:28:08] because god's the force multiplier
[1:28:11] god's the one that can come in and take
[1:28:13] something that may seem well i've got
[1:28:15] little but god can little as much as we
[1:28:17] sing is when god is in it
[1:28:19] so i'm barely getting by with using a
[1:28:21] hundred percent to pay my bills well you
[1:28:24] there's a there's a there's a there's a
[1:28:26] need there obviously there's a blessing
[1:28:28] that you want god to
[1:28:30] to
[1:28:31] uh you you want god to come and make
[1:28:33] that means if 100 is barely making 100
[1:28:36] of your outgoing or your liabilities and
[1:28:38] your your needs you need god to touch
[1:28:40] you you need god to help you need god to
[1:28:41] give you some wisdom and insight as to
[1:28:42] how your affairs are being managed lord
[1:28:45] get you out of some circumstance you
[1:28:46] need the blessings of god maybe someone
[1:28:48] to come along and help you out a little
[1:28:49] bit you need it and you need to humble
[1:28:51] yourself and recognize what your
[1:28:53] christian responsibility of duty is to
[1:28:56] god not to man or the church but to god
[1:28:59] and i do not believe that god it would
[1:29:01] be wrong even as there's statements here
[1:29:04] in quotes of brother branham that i'm
[1:29:05] not going to read where i'm saying i've
[1:29:06] never seen it fail one time
[1:29:09] and just as we read a moment ago he says
[1:29:11] and just see prove me
[1:29:13] god says
[1:29:14] with a promise to bless it and to proof
[1:29:17] if you don't believe me come and prove
[1:29:18] me and see if i won't do it is what he
[1:29:20] says god is doing so god is being very
[1:29:22] overt about this saying you know what if
[1:29:24] you'll do it i'm going to bless you
[1:29:26] prove me try me so it's one of those
[1:29:28] places where you say okay well i'm going
[1:29:30] to do it to prove god
[1:29:34] and then the next statement i know we've
[1:29:35] ministered on this
[1:29:37] at one point as it says there will not
[1:29:40] be room enough in your
[1:29:42] uh for you to contain the blessing and i
[1:29:44] will rebuke the devourer for your sakes
[1:29:47] the consumer
[1:29:48] what's the devour the thing that
[1:29:49] whittles away at your resources the
[1:29:50] thing that whittles the way at your
[1:29:51] crops that eats away at your fruits i'll
[1:29:54] rebuke the devourer and he shall not
[1:29:56] destroy the fruits of your ground
[1:29:57] neither shall your vine cast her fruit
[1:29:59] before the time in the field saith the
[1:30:00] lord of hosts he will bless your labors
[1:30:03] exponentially amen
[1:30:05] i think maybe there's a stigma in a
[1:30:07] stain on preaching about prosperity or
[1:30:08] seed offerings and things like that
[1:30:10] because
[1:30:11] people have just really stained it
[1:30:14] there's a lot of rotten nonsense when it
[1:30:15] relates to it but let's just get all
[1:30:17] that out of the way and come to the
[1:30:18] promise
[1:30:20] i mean there's no ladder house blessing
[1:30:22] and let's get up here and confess our
[1:30:23] teslas and everything else and you know
[1:30:27] this little this this obscure
[1:30:30] uh cryptocurrency i'm all in on you know
[1:30:32] that the price is just going to go up a
[1:30:33] thousand times no let's just forget all
[1:30:35] that
[1:30:37] and let's just again take the advice
[1:30:39] that we've heard over the last few
[1:30:40] services from the message of our live
[1:30:42] for god
[1:30:43] live humbly work labor plant your
[1:30:45] potatoes harvest your potatoes plant
[1:30:46] your wheat harvest your wheat and give
[1:30:48] unto the lord
[1:30:50] this isn't a we're not trying to fleece
[1:30:52] god to win the lottery but these are
[1:30:54] things that we do and he says i will
[1:30:56] bless you anybody here want to throw up
[1:30:58] a hand and say you've lived it
[1:31:00] you've experienced it when you've
[1:31:01] honored god he's blessed you
[1:31:03] i could testify that god has done that
[1:31:05] for me time and time and time again
[1:31:08] i'm going to keep going god being
[1:31:10] misunderstood brother brahms asked the
[1:31:11] question in this service can a christian
[1:31:13] go to heaven if he or she does not pay
[1:31:15] tithe
[1:31:16] you want to know the answer to this oh
[1:31:17] it's right there you see it
[1:31:19] he goes i could not say yes or no to
[1:31:21] that
[1:31:22] but i do believe that every christian is
[1:31:24] obligated to pay tithings because it is
[1:31:26] a commandment of the lord
[1:31:28] and blessed are they that do all his
[1:31:30] commandments that they might be have a
[1:31:32] right to enter into life the tree of
[1:31:33] life quoting them from revelation now i
[1:31:35] do believe that the tithe that tithe
[1:31:37] payon is essential to a christian
[1:31:39] experience
[1:31:42] he says a christian is obligated to pay
[1:31:44] tithings because i do believe that tithe
[1:31:45] pain is essential to a christian
[1:31:48] experience
[1:31:50] i can say this and i've often thought
[1:31:51] about it because um i'm
[1:31:54] receiving the tithes here and making
[1:31:56] taking meticulous records of it i see
[1:31:58] the faithfulness of some people
[1:32:00] and i and and i know the needs in their
[1:32:03] hearts and what they desire in life and
[1:32:04] they're so faithful to do it and i can't
[1:32:06] tell you enough just how much that
[1:32:09] giving resonates to god
[1:32:13] that there's a there's a deliberate i've
[1:32:15] even noticed that with certain people
[1:32:16] that they have one job and then they
[1:32:17] have other jobs and you always know
[1:32:19] they've picked up something extra
[1:32:21] because they don't waste any time it's
[1:32:22] almost as if they got paid by paypal
[1:32:24] they immediately turn around and pay
[1:32:25] tithes by paypal say oh they must have
[1:32:27] just model on it two o'clock in the
[1:32:28] afternoon
[1:32:30] because they're so quick to give they're
[1:32:31] so faithful in those things and it's
[1:32:34] it's essential to the christian
[1:32:36] experience it's part of this obligation
[1:32:38] and i see people doing it and i see
[1:32:40] they're honoring god and doing it and i
[1:32:41] know that god doesn't miss it
[1:32:46] it's essential to
[1:32:47] the christian experience
[1:32:49] and i would like to add that as he says
[1:32:51] this tithe and tithe and
[1:32:54] i'm not trying to change what he's
[1:32:56] saying
[1:32:57] but as the old testament called all of
[1:32:59] those gifts tithes
[1:33:01] i would say it's also essential to give
[1:33:03] offerings
[1:33:04] essential to give to missions oh well
[1:33:06] how much how much this is free will
[1:33:09] this is voluntary this is what's in your
[1:33:11] heart to give this is according to each
[1:33:13] man's measure is what god has blessed
[1:33:15] you
[1:33:16] in second corinthians chapter nine
[1:33:17] verses five to nine
[1:33:20] again there's much more in some of these
[1:33:22] passages
[1:33:24] uh and i found that the way that paul
[1:33:26] writes it sometimes
[1:33:28] um
[1:33:29] it's not as apparent it's maybe used in
[1:33:31] a different language than maybe we would
[1:33:32] like but and you'll notice he says
[1:33:34] therefore i thought it necessary to
[1:33:35] exhort the brethren that they would go
[1:33:36] before unto you and make up beforehand
[1:33:38] your bounty what was their bounty to
[1:33:40] collect their offerings
[1:33:42] collect their giving he calls it bounty
[1:33:45] where have you had noticed before that
[1:33:46] the same might be ready as a matter of
[1:33:48] bounty and not as of covetousness so
[1:33:50] this bounty is a free will offering it's
[1:33:52] a gift it's giving
[1:33:53] it says but this i say he which soweth
[1:33:55] sparingly shall reap also sparingly and
[1:33:58] he which soweth bountifully shall reap
[1:34:00] also bountifully
[1:34:02] paul not trying to impose by guilt or
[1:34:04] condemnation or by covetousness or use
[1:34:07] any other metric or try law to get
[1:34:10] people to give he says we're going to
[1:34:11] collect you're going to give it's in
[1:34:13] your duty i would say as a christian to
[1:34:15] give but he says this is your metric by
[1:34:17] which you can measure your giving if
[1:34:19] you're going to give a little you'll get
[1:34:21] a little
[1:34:22] but if you give a lot you'll reap a lot
[1:34:24] this is just what the new testament is
[1:34:25] saying when it says bounty making up
[1:34:27] your bounty is a matter of giving as a
[1:34:28] matter of giving he's directly referring
[1:34:31] not necessarily our spiritual works of
[1:34:33] prayer and reading our bible and praying
[1:34:36] and laying hands on the sick and those
[1:34:38] things but he's literally talking about
[1:34:39] giving
[1:34:41] and he says he that sows sparingly will
[1:34:43] reap sparingly but he that sows
[1:34:45] bountifully shall reap bountifully and
[1:34:46] then what's the measure by which i want
[1:34:48] to give every man according as he has
[1:34:50] purposed in his heart so let him give
[1:34:53] not grudgingly or of necessity for god
[1:34:55] love with the cheerful giver
[1:34:57] this is what i would say would instruct
[1:34:59] all of us in terms of our offerings our
[1:35:00] building fund donations our giving to
[1:35:03] some have given specific offerings to us
[1:35:05] moving into here as there's been a lot
[1:35:06] of different needs associated with it
[1:35:09] and the things that you see even the
[1:35:10] fact that we got went out and got these
[1:35:12] monitors that are here in the sanctuary
[1:35:14] one that's going to be going in the
[1:35:15] fellowship hall one in the nursery these
[1:35:17] were all given
[1:35:20] free will someone gave it the church
[1:35:22] church didn't spend the money to do it
[1:35:24] it wasn't even an offering someone just
[1:35:25] went out and bought them and provided
[1:35:27] them what they do they did that within
[1:35:28] their means and trusting no one's going
[1:35:30] into debt to do these things but they
[1:35:32] did it within their means is they'd
[1:35:33] purposed in their heart and they didn't
[1:35:34] do it grudgingly
[1:35:36] well i guess if i'm gonna have a deep
[1:35:38] decent screen to see the words on i
[1:35:39] better go buy a decent size
[1:35:42] it's not having to mess with the
[1:35:43] keystone on that projector and it's so
[1:35:45] loud and it took up five different seats
[1:35:47] and
[1:35:48] you know it was uh not of even of
[1:35:50] necessity well i guess i better have to
[1:35:52] do this but a cheerful giver
[1:35:54] this is the standard by which we measure
[1:35:56] our giving as christians knowing that if
[1:35:58] i sow i'll reap if i sow a lot i'll reap
[1:36:01] a lot if i sow a little i'll reap a
[1:36:03] little
[1:36:04] and then i'd do it as i purpose in my
[1:36:06] heart my conviction as the spirit of god
[1:36:08] would lead me that's that way if i could
[1:36:10] say this to all of us here if for some
[1:36:11] reason you know how much somebody else
[1:36:13] has given don't ever belittle it don't
[1:36:15] ever despise it
[1:36:17] don't compare don't judge well this
[1:36:19] person over here only gives 50 bucks i
[1:36:21] get
[1:36:22] 52. don't ever compare don't ever brag
[1:36:26] don't ever look at what you think you
[1:36:27] can give in someone else because every
[1:36:28] man has to do it as he purposes in his
[1:36:30] heart to give
[1:36:34] and he says god loves a cheerful giver
[1:36:36] verse 8 is extraordinary and god is able
[1:36:38] to make all grace abound towards you
[1:36:42] directly as a response to your given
[1:36:43] he's able to make all grace abound you
[1:36:45] that ye always having all sufficiency in
[1:36:47] all things may abound to every good work
[1:36:49] this is what god is able to do remember
[1:36:51] this as you give remember god loves a
[1:36:53] cheerful giver gives you purpose in your
[1:36:54] heart but remember if you so little get
[1:36:56] a little and he says so god is able to
[1:36:57] make all grace abound your that you will
[1:37:00] always have sufficiency in all things
[1:37:02] and abound to every good work you say
[1:37:04] remember this as you give
[1:37:06] let this be what's in your heart as you
[1:37:08] give that god is able to make his grace
[1:37:11] abound towards you that you'd have
[1:37:13] sufficiency in all things i would i
[1:37:15] would say that there's probably some
[1:37:17] people that could pause right now and
[1:37:19] stop and look back in their lives and
[1:37:21] say oh maybe i wasn't as smart in
[1:37:22] business as i thought it was
[1:37:25] maybe i didn't just time the market
[1:37:27] right maybe i didn't maybe this didn't
[1:37:29] happen because i was sharp and look back
[1:37:30] and say you know what i've always
[1:37:32] honored the lord
[1:37:33] by worshiping him in my giving to
[1:37:35] whatever i was able to do there's
[1:37:37] situations where some people can't give
[1:37:39] because of certain circumstances but
[1:37:40] they give what they can and you can look
[1:37:42] back in your life and find you always
[1:37:44] did what you could in your means from a
[1:37:45] heart from a cheerful heart and god
[1:37:48] always said i'll bless you i'll make up
[1:37:50] the difference i'll bless your endeavors
[1:37:52] i'll bless what you're trying to do you
[1:37:54] give you've given you've given you've
[1:37:55] given i've looked out after you and
[1:37:56] you're not
[1:37:58] deserving of a seed in the shark tank or
[1:38:01] in a fortune to run a fortune 500
[1:38:03] company you've just always honored the
[1:38:05] lord with your giving and he's honored
[1:38:07] you
[1:38:08] he says in verse 9 as it is written he
[1:38:09] hath dispersed abroad he hath given to
[1:38:12] the poor his righteousness remained
[1:38:14] forever
[1:38:16] this is what god is able to do to
[1:38:18] disperse abroad to even to you to allow
[1:38:20] it to arrive to you
[1:38:21] god is able to for his grace to abound
[1:38:23] you and have sufficiency in all things
[1:38:25] paul relating it specifically to our new
[1:38:28] testament
[1:38:29] christian giving
[1:38:32] jesus says it this way in luke chapter 6
[1:38:33] verse 38
[1:38:34] give and it shall be given unto you
[1:38:38] as
[1:38:39] paul related it
[1:38:40] that christ said it is blessed more
[1:38:42] blessed to give than to receive give and
[1:38:44] it shall be given unto you good measure
[1:38:46] pressed down shaken together and running
[1:38:48] over it's an illusion to the offerings
[1:38:50] in the old testament and how there was
[1:38:53] this offering that was made and when you
[1:38:55] wanted to get it right you'd press it
[1:38:56] down right you're gonna have somebody i
[1:38:58] don't know how this works so correct me
[1:39:00] later but when you're someone's gonna be
[1:39:01] making you espresso don't they grind it
[1:39:03] and then press it and don't you want to
[1:39:05] make sure they get it all in there
[1:39:07] you know just a little dainty little
[1:39:09] dollop in there just to let you know you
[1:39:10] want it okay you want to be strong it's
[1:39:12] pressed down and when they pour it when
[1:39:14] you say no foam why because you want it
[1:39:16] to the top
[1:39:17] don't cheat me you pressed it down you
[1:39:19] want it to press down and you want it
[1:39:21] and when they pour it get it to the top
[1:39:22] no foam get it on top i want all of it
[1:39:24] he says this is what god will do give
[1:39:26] and will be given to you good measure
[1:39:27] press down shake now and run it shall
[1:39:29] men give into your bosom for the same
[1:39:31] measure that you meet with all it shall
[1:39:33] be measured to you again
[1:39:36] this is a principle applicable in a lot
[1:39:38] of different areas whether it be your
[1:39:39] attitude towards others your lack of
[1:39:41] grace and patience to somebody your
[1:39:43] whatever judgment you meet out you'll be
[1:39:45] met with but now whatever measure you
[1:39:47] are giving whatever worship you give
[1:39:48] whatever praise you give to god whatever
[1:39:51] lifting up whatever heaving and exalting
[1:39:53] and worship and praise there's an equal
[1:39:55] blessing reciprocal to what you're
[1:39:56] giving and give and it shall be given to
[1:39:59] you and god with good measure pressed
[1:40:01] down shaken together and running over
[1:40:02] shall god even give into your bosom and
[1:40:05] you'll receive it at others from others
[1:40:07] as you distribute to their necessities
[1:40:09] and look out after them in their need
[1:40:16] i'm working to a close here but just
[1:40:18] give me some feedback is this helpful
[1:40:20] this morning
[1:40:21] has it been also helpful this afternoon
[1:40:24] because it it is 12 15.
[1:40:28] rounding up a bit
[1:40:31] just two more statements i'd like to
[1:40:32] read with you but we're closing with
[1:40:33] this one of them i didn't even provide
[1:40:34] because i just didn't know where we'd be
[1:40:35] here at the end
[1:40:37] but i've got i've got uh three more
[1:40:39] pages here in front of me
[1:40:41] if you're if you're up to it
[1:40:43] redemption by judgment
[1:40:45] at the very end of the sermon brother
[1:40:46] graham's praying
[1:40:47] they're taking up an offering get ready
[1:40:48] to take up an offering and this is how
[1:40:49] he prays he says our kind heavenly
[1:40:51] father
[1:40:52] thou has taught us in the word that
[1:40:54] let every man lay aside that god has
[1:40:57] prospered him
[1:40:58] that when the first day of the week when
[1:40:59] we come together that we should bring in
[1:41:01] our tithe and offerings into the place
[1:41:02] your house
[1:41:04] it's it's
[1:41:05] kind of a
[1:41:06] seems to be alluding to first
[1:41:07] corinthians 16 but this is what he's
[1:41:09] saying we're taught
[1:41:11] and we see this in the word
[1:41:13] and he says and we thank thee for the
[1:41:15] privilege that we have of worship thee
[1:41:18] in this manner
[1:41:19] which is such a little way
[1:41:22] doesn't it seem small maybe
[1:41:25] the the baskets that we pass out
[1:41:28] doesn't it seem small
[1:41:30] have we ever thought maybe it interrupts
[1:41:32] the flow of the song service
[1:41:33] right
[1:41:34] song leaders
[1:41:36] sometimes you just want to worship and
[1:41:37] you got to remember take up the offering
[1:41:39] take the
[1:41:40] take up the prayer request and let the
[1:41:42] sunday school in and you just all these
[1:41:44] different formalities but maybe we could
[1:41:46] kind of just change our whole approach
[1:41:47] to it and realize
[1:41:48] worship hasn't even hiccuped
[1:41:53] when they come forward with the baskets
[1:41:54] to take up an offering
[1:41:56] it may seem so small and it may seem
[1:41:58] disconcordant with lifting hands and
[1:42:00] praising but then people digging into
[1:42:02] their wallets and their purses and
[1:42:04] people shuffling around and i we know
[1:42:06] how it is those of us who bore the
[1:42:07] baskets how awkward you might feel when
[1:42:09] you're kind of standing there you know
[1:42:10] like who wants it where do i go and
[1:42:12] sometimes you walk the whole length you
[1:42:14] go 90 feet and don't have anything in it
[1:42:17] we've had services where nobody gave
[1:42:19] anything
[1:42:21] but we gave an opportunity
[1:42:24] and we know that this may seem a little
[1:42:25] bit awkward and it may seem
[1:42:28] not like what the worship we think it
[1:42:30] should be praised it should be
[1:42:31] instruments it should be clapping of
[1:42:32] hands and and some of us may really
[1:42:34] really love the music but if you love
[1:42:36] worship you'll give
[1:42:38] because as you look at this let every
[1:42:39] man lay aside which he's prospered him
[1:42:41] and when the first day of the week this
[1:42:42] sunday we come together we should bring
[1:42:44] our tithe and offerings into this place
[1:42:47] he says and we thank you for the
[1:42:48] privilege we have to worship thee in
[1:42:49] this manner which is such a little way
[1:42:52] it's small but it's a privilege to be
[1:42:54] able to worship him with giving
[1:42:56] maybe you would you would better
[1:42:58] appreciate this if you never had
[1:42:59] anything to give
[1:43:01] and maybe some of us have been in that
[1:43:02] place where we didn't have anything to
[1:43:03] give
[1:43:05] he said but we thank thee for it father
[1:43:07] and with grateful hearts we come to thee
[1:43:08] this morning bless all those who do give
[1:43:12] that have to give
[1:43:13] that has to give from
[1:43:15] and bless those who do not have of these
[1:43:17] natural substances to give from we pray
[1:43:19] that you'll give them many and much more
[1:43:21] than natural substance as your steward
[1:43:24] help us to watch over it
[1:43:27] and it's a much of the natural substance
[1:43:29] as your steward help us to watch over it
[1:43:31] in the right way that will be spent for
[1:43:34] the right thing
[1:43:35] this we ask in christ's name thy son
[1:43:38] amen amen
[1:43:40] that beautiful
[1:43:42] that's the attitude towards it it's not
[1:43:43] a formality it's not tradition
[1:43:45] it's not collecting attacks
[1:43:48] when the bill comes due
[1:43:50] one of the dad jokes i tell is when the
[1:43:52] server comes and says would you like the
[1:43:54] check i say no
[1:43:58] and so it's not like the checks coming
[1:44:00] due and you've got to pay this
[1:44:03] but lotus it's
[1:44:04] worship we thank you for the privilege
[1:44:07] we have to worship you in this manner
[1:44:10] such a little way when you write out
[1:44:12] your check if you're doing it digitally
[1:44:14] that's fine and i'm not encouraging
[1:44:16] everyone to necessarily do that there's
[1:44:17] a lot of talk and some of the some of
[1:44:19] the chat groups and a lot of the data
[1:44:21] that's being flooded around there that
[1:44:22] we've been able to exponentially
[1:44:23] increase our giving by going totally
[1:44:25] over to paypal well that's wonderful but
[1:44:28] what i want is our worship to be
[1:44:30] exponential
[1:44:31] and i don't have any issue with people
[1:44:33] using those manners
[1:44:35] those means to give it's very convenient
[1:44:38] uh if you just want convenience i'll
[1:44:40] just set it up by bluetooth or nfc that
[1:44:42] as soon as you walk in that door we take
[1:44:43] 23.3 percent
[1:44:46] if you want efficiency
[1:44:48] like gratuity is added to a party of
[1:44:50] eight or more
[1:44:52] all right
[1:44:54] we could do something like that but it's
[1:44:55] more your
[1:44:57] free will in your heart as you are able
[1:44:59] as the lord has prospered you
[1:45:01] don't ever feel ashamed that there's a
[1:45:03] special offering and in your heart you
[1:45:04] can't give
[1:45:06] you're not able to give don't ever feel
[1:45:08] ashamed in that don't ever lift yourself
[1:45:10] up above somebody else whenever there's
[1:45:11] an offering and you're able to give a
[1:45:13] lot just always thank god and as brother
[1:45:15] branham prayed bless those that have
[1:45:17] some to give from and bless those who
[1:45:20] don't have it and may you give them
[1:45:22] natural substance that they can give
[1:45:23] from
[1:45:25] why not so that we could pay off a
[1:45:27] church building or we could go out and
[1:45:28] do this and i remember one time a
[1:45:30] brother
[1:45:31] had a built a new church as a really
[1:45:33] nice church they had a kind of a smaller
[1:45:35] church and able to build a new church
[1:45:37] and there's a really nice church and he
[1:45:38] said from the pulpit i'm not going to
[1:45:40] stop until the pulpit is gold
[1:45:44] real nice
[1:45:46] that's not the attitude that's not the
[1:45:47] goal it's one of the things i love about
[1:45:48] this building there's no pretense
[1:45:52] it's it's that little room not the
[1:45:54] cathedral
[1:45:56] and i'm grateful for it but the
[1:45:58] opportunity to give it's a privilege
[1:45:59] that we have to worship in such a little
[1:46:01] way that's the opportunity being
[1:46:03] presented to you as you have means and
[1:46:05] can give and to do it faithfully
[1:46:08] to do it consistently
[1:46:10] because the giving of tithes and
[1:46:11] offerings is part of your worship to god
[1:46:13] amen
[1:46:15] and there's a lot of scriptures we could
[1:46:16] use to bring into this
[1:46:18] area right here but this
[1:46:21] this worship
[1:46:22] survives the abolishment of the law
[1:46:25] it survives the disbanding of the
[1:46:26] levitical priesthood and the abolishment
[1:46:28] of the sacrifices this worship continues
[1:46:31] the worship in your giving
[1:46:34] has survived the law
[1:46:36] the worship continues this worship of
[1:46:39] giving of distributing to the needs of
[1:46:41] the saints the collection on the first
[1:46:42] day of the week all these different
[1:46:43] things and the shadow that the law held
[1:46:46] that's now fulfilled in the body of
[1:46:47] christ through our free will offerings
[1:46:49] and through our tithing and our giving
[1:46:51] that worship still continues after the
[1:46:53] fulfillment of the law by christ that's
[1:46:55] still alive today
[1:46:57] because god says prove me
[1:46:59] what what a declaration prove me i
[1:47:02] promise if you give i promise if you pay
[1:47:04] i'll multiply your substance
[1:47:07] and broadband said that's a challenge
[1:47:08] for anybody every christian that goes
[1:47:10] for this question and every other
[1:47:11] question he's referring to this question
[1:47:12] this other question every christian
[1:47:14] should pay tithes that's right it should
[1:47:16] be done and he says it's a challenge to
[1:47:18] anybody and he's taking it straight from
[1:47:19] malachi 3.
[1:47:23] musicians if you could
[1:47:25] make ready to come in the pergamy and
[1:47:27] age i'm just going to close with this
[1:47:28] statement
[1:47:30] that everyone says and we do have in our
[1:47:32] there's my alarm i got to stop and we do
[1:47:34] have in our protestant churches
[1:47:39] soup suppers entertainments skating oh
[1:47:41] my rag cells and everything else
[1:47:44] now you know that's the truth
[1:47:46] well now if that is god's word friends
[1:47:50] it's the truth
[1:47:52] and all protestant churches are guilty
[1:47:56] never was god's plan to have soup
[1:47:58] suppers and dances in the basements
[1:48:00] and all their carrying on to pay off the
[1:48:02] pastor and things
[1:48:05] if people were just taught to pay their
[1:48:07] tithes
[1:48:09] that would be all there would be to it
[1:48:11] that's god's plan
[1:48:15] god has a plan
[1:48:17] but man monster wants to make his own
[1:48:19] plan
[1:48:20] hybriding
[1:48:22] god's plan
[1:48:25] if that was just taught
[1:48:27] that'd be all there would be to it
[1:48:30] so we've taken a couple hours today
[1:48:32] to teach it
[1:48:34] knowing that god has made a promise
[1:48:36] that if you do it that's all you need
