[0:00] If you could turn to Titus chapter 1,
[0:02] I'm going to read verse 12 and then
[0:07] jump into my thought. We'll do a little
[0:09] bit of background for just a few things
[0:11] on Wednesday night as they kind of
[0:13] connect together and then if you want to
[0:15] hold your place in Titus, we'll come
[0:17] back to um these verses here
[0:23] very quickly. Titus chapter 1 verse 12.
[0:26] one of themselves, even a prophet of
[0:29] their own, said, "The cretins are always
[0:32] liars. Evil beast, slow bellies." The
[0:35] cretins are always liars, evil beast,
[0:39] slow bellies. Amen. You can be seated.
[0:44] Hope nobody takes personal offense to
[0:46] that description. Uh to be liars, evil
[0:49] beast, and slow bellies. Uh but we can
[0:51] see here Paul is using some very strong
[0:53] language and quoting somebody else in
[0:55] doing so. And so Paul being a prophet,
[0:58] my title today is the prophet and the
[1:01] philosophers. As Wednesday night we
[1:03] ministered on the prophet and the poets
[1:06] uh wanting to look at how pro the
[1:08] prophet Paul used works of art in
[1:11] popular culture uh to teach the believer
[1:13] but then also to reach the sinner. and
[1:16] we went to uh covered it in great detail
[1:18] I believe on Wednesday night and even
[1:21] this morning there's going to be a lot
[1:22] of practical things that are covered and
[1:24] so I know you might think in terms of
[1:26] well what does this have to do with art
[1:27] and how can I apply this to something I
[1:30] might see in a museum and uh there might
[1:32] be ways you try to pigeon hole it into
[1:34] just even the subject of witnessing but
[1:36] there's a lot of practical things that
[1:38] are covered and certain principles
[1:40] that'll even help us with elements of
[1:42] the message today as you look at the
[1:44] ministry of Paul you see such a
[1:46] tremendous parallel to the word that
[1:47] we've received today. And so I just
[1:49] encourage you at the outset just to try
[1:51] to really enter in and focus. Don't
[1:53] necessarily try to get ahead or make it
[1:55] fit some uh maybe narrative that you
[1:57] think I'm trying to express, but just
[1:58] really focus and say, "Lord, what can I
[2:00] glean from this? What can I take away
[2:02] from this?" Because there's going to be
[2:04] u a lot of examination of history and
[2:06] certain sources. And I believe they can
[2:08] provide some real helpful insight, some
[2:10] perspective and again help us to
[2:12] understand that things that even brother
[2:14] Brandham taught today and sources that
[2:15] he drew from uh is something that
[2:17] prophets do to make a point and what we
[2:20] want to get the point. It's not that
[2:21] we're trying to get the history right,
[2:22] but we want to get the point right. Now
[2:24] in Acts chapter 17 verse 28, we were
[2:28] reading this on Wednesday night. Paul in
[2:30] Athens and as he had been so moved by
[2:32] the sinfulness that was before him and
[2:34] he began to minister Christ uh to some
[2:36] of these groups of Stoics and these
[2:37] philosophers. It says he's now uh coming
[2:41] to this great sermon there uh in the
[2:44] Acropolis in Mars Hill and he says for
[2:47] in him we live and move and have our
[2:49] being. Now to us when we read this we
[2:51] read this from a at least a
[2:53] Judeo-Christian mindset. We think of
[2:55] Elohim, the one true God, and we say,
[2:57] "In him we live and move and have our
[2:59] being." And to that we say, "Amen." And
[3:01] he says, "As certain also of your own
[3:03] poets have said." And so now we think,
[3:06] well, he's referring to some other. He's
[3:08] referring to their source, not maybe the
[3:10] Old Testament or his source, but your
[3:13] own poets have said, "For we are also
[3:15] his offspring." The prophet used the
[3:18] poets. He quotes them here to preach the
[3:19] gospel to those who did not know his
[3:22] God. They may have known Zeus or
[3:24] Jupiter. they would have worshiped some
[3:25] other uh deities or other gods and they
[3:28] had their mythology. So, he uses
[3:30] something of their own to say we are
[3:32] also his offspring. And I know that this
[3:35] may seem self- serving to what I've been
[3:37] doing over the last several months, but
[3:39] I believe that Paul was using the arts
[3:41] and the art of his day to make Christ
[3:43] real even to say make them relevant or
[3:46] relatable by saying your own pro poets
[3:48] have said this and and you worship an
[3:50] unknown god, but I want to make him
[3:52] known to you so that you can realize
[3:54] this is the one that fits what has been
[3:56] said. And really when you look at it, we
[3:59] would say maybe this is a masterpiece or
[4:01] a masterclass in how that Paul preached
[4:03] this sermon to the Athenians. When we
[4:06] read this here, for we are also his
[4:08] offspring. We saw that it was from an
[4:10] ancient poem by Aratus uh in phenomena
[4:13] and how this very phrase was in that
[4:15] poem. We also found that it was in a
[4:18] poem written by Cleanths entitled the
[4:20] hymn to Jupiter. So those are places
[4:22] that we saw these very things uh that
[4:26] Paul is quoting these poets uh in his
[4:29] sermon to those on Mars Hill. But
[4:32] there's also a question as I you study
[4:34] this out and you look at these things
[4:35] and maybe for me it's just a burden that
[4:37] maybe drives me in to do this. For
[4:39] others it may be a curiosity. I had one
[4:41] brother reach out to me and said that he
[4:43] had been anxiously waiting for someone
[4:44] to minister on this subject for many
[4:46] years. And so now having that burden
[4:49] met, I don't know what they're going to
[4:50] do with the rest of their lives, but
[4:51] we've we satisfied that thirst that they
[4:53] had. But there's a question whether or
[4:55] not Paul is actually quoting poets in
[4:57] the first phrase because he says, "For
[4:59] in him we live and move and have our
[5:01] being as your own poets have said." And
[5:03] some say that applies to the first part
[5:07] and then we looked at how it does apply
[5:09] to the second part. Poets have alluded
[5:12] to uh Jove, we read that on Wednesday
[5:15] night. who fulfills everything and how
[5:18] the spirit of Zeus is moving in us. We
[5:20] can see there's certain applications to
[5:22] that. One of them was the soul of all
[5:24] created things that live and move on
[5:26] earth receive from thee the image of the
[5:29] one. This is being spoken of Jupiter,
[5:31] not Jehovah, not the one true God, not
[5:33] Elohim, but this is being spoken of a
[5:36] mythological God. And yet we see the
[5:38] language is similar to in him we live
[5:40] and move and have our being. Now this is
[5:43] also this phrase for in him we live move
[5:46] and have our being is a phrase directly
[5:48] from ancient writing. This I hope this
[5:50] doesn't stumble anybody to learn that
[5:52] Paul is quoting a pagan poem in Acts
[5:54] 17:28. But in the ninth uh there was a
[5:58] professor in the 20th century who came
[6:01] across a commentary in the book of acts
[6:04] from the 9th century and then also a a
[6:06] liturgy and it was a Syrian uh uh
[6:09] liturgy from in in the hundreds I don't
[6:12] know what the year it was. I I spent a
[6:13] lot of time trying to find what
[6:14] lectionary it was was but it referred to
[6:16] a poem and both of them relying on a
[6:19] Christian theologian from the 4th
[6:21] century. When you study some things,
[6:22] you'll find that one person says one
[6:24] thing and everybody then quotes that
[6:26] person. And sometimes you can't even
[6:28] find where the other person got it. But
[6:29] this seems to be widely accepted. And
[6:32] there was this 4th century Theodore was
[6:34] his name and he quoted a poem by
[6:38] Epheminities from Minos and Raha
[6:41] Domanthis. And it says, follow this.
[6:43] You're gonna you're gonna be tested on
[6:45] this later. Bring your blue books, your
[6:47] scantrons, and a lot of sharp pencils
[6:50] because we're going to test you on this.
[6:51] And this is the poem. This is an ancient
[6:53] poem. Now, it's this was written in BC,
[6:56] 4th century AD. It's being written down.
[6:59] And then these other later uh
[7:01] theologians and Christians relied upon
[7:03] it. A grave has been fashioned for thee,
[7:06] oh high and holy one. Thy lying cretins,
[7:08] who are all the time liars, evil beast,
[7:11] idle bellies, but thou diest not. For to
[7:14] eternity thou livest and standest, for
[7:16] in thee we live and move and have our
[7:19] being. So he's quoting this poem uh from
[7:24] this ancient poem written by some a
[7:26] mythological character is some say he
[7:28] lived 157 years that he went to sleep in
[7:31] a cave as a young man and slept for over
[7:33] 50 years and we all say I wish we could
[7:35] do that. uh and and so there's a lot of
[7:37] mythology that surrounds him, but he's
[7:39] accepted to be someone that wrote this
[7:41] poem. And this is the poem that he
[7:43] writes for the Zeus we live and move and
[7:46] have our be. And this is who Paul is
[7:48] quoting. Now, as we read that, you might
[7:50] have noticed some similarity to our
[7:51] text. So, let's look at Titus chapter 1.
[7:54] Let's start with verse 5. And we'll
[7:57] start walking through this very slowly.
[7:59] We'll look a little bit at just the
[8:01] location of this and then some specific
[8:03] principles.
[8:05] uh please just view this within the
[8:06] context of this singular sermon. Uh and
[8:09] then as the Lord will allow you to apply
[8:10] it into other areas uh that's great. I
[8:13] think it fits within the whole but I
[8:14] don't want you to get distracted. But
[8:16] just take it as it comes and may the
[8:18] Lord use it to strengthen you. Paul
[8:20] writes this and he's telling Titus uh
[8:23] that he's left him for this cause I left
[8:26] thee Titus inree that thou should have
[8:29] set in order the things that are wanting
[8:31] and ordering elders in every city as I
[8:33] had appointed thee. So Paul is leaving
[8:36] Titus in Cree. This is a Mediterranean
[8:38] island. It's about 60 mi long. It ranges
[8:40] from anywhere from 7 to 35 miles wide
[8:43] and it's very mountainous, very fertile
[8:45] and it's well populated. So it's a quite
[8:47] a big uh island today. And cit was the
[8:50] center of the manoan civila
[8:52] civilization. This is one of the first
[8:53] advanced civilization. Just a small
[8:55] island. A lot of culture, a lot of
[8:57] civilization came from it. First mention
[8:59] you have of the aisle cree is from
[9:00] Homer's Odyssey in which he mentions uh
[9:03] Cree as an island in the ancient Greek.
[9:07] And Cree, a lot of you students or if
[9:09] you've ever take a Greek literature
[9:11] class or Greek mythology, you'll see
[9:12] that Cree is an island that is
[9:13] associated with Greek gods and
[9:15] mythology. It's the birthplace of Zeus.
[9:17] It's where Zeus's son that half man half
[9:19] horse ruled and reigned King Minus and
[9:22] was there on the island of Creed is
[9:24] allegedly right you don't just I'm just
[9:26] telling you what the mythology teaches
[9:29] and historians have seen that from the
[9:31] time of Abraham even to Moses there was
[9:33] a real thriving civilization on this
[9:35] island even by 140 BC as a lot of Jews
[9:38] were being dispersed uh they had
[9:40] established a large enough colony that
[9:41] there on the alakrete they'd appealed
[9:43] for the protection of the Roman Empire
[9:46] in Acts chapter 2:1 we'll see that there
[9:48] were people from the aisle of creed or
[9:50] Christians that were present at
[9:52] Pentecost. They heard Paul preach. They
[9:54] were possibly conver converted and then
[9:56] returned back to their home country um
[9:59] as believers as converted Jews to
[10:01] Christianity and brought the gospel
[10:03] back. So with the gospel taking root on
[10:06] this island a and churches being
[10:08] established Paul says I'm leaving you
[10:10] Titus in cree for this purpose for one
[10:13] thing that was needful or this one thing
[10:15] that was needed to set in order the
[10:18] things that are wanting and ordain
[10:20] elders in every city. This is this won't
[10:23] stumble anybody that's here today but
[10:25] this would be something really hard for
[10:26] some people to accept. But he's saying
[10:28] I've left you here to set in order
[10:31] things that are needful. something that
[10:33] is lacking and that's to ordain pastors
[10:35] in every church. We might think pastor I
[10:39] can say that when brother Philip's not
[10:40] here cough Philip coffee he's the one
[10:42] that's like pastor what's a pastor uh
[10:45] these this is something that is needful
[10:48] in the sermon perseverance brother says
[10:50] I believe this is there's a church
[10:52] coming into that perfection that
[10:54] ministry of perfection where the offices
[10:58] where apostles prophets teachers pastors
[11:00] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[11:02] church them pastors and teachers and so
[11:04] forth will be so with the word so You're
[11:06] really not a ministry of perfection if
[11:08] you're not with the word. So with the
[11:10] word until the whole thing will work
[11:11] right up to the coming of the Lord. I
[11:14] believe that. I believe we're nearing
[11:16] that now. And so he's saying it's that
[11:18] ministry of perfection in these offices
[11:20] that we read about in Ephesians chapter
[11:22] 4. Later in the same sermon, he says now
[11:25] he set in the church to keep the church
[11:27] in line with the word. So you see now
[11:30] why Paul has left Titus is these
[11:33] ministries have to be placed in the
[11:35] church for the perfecting of the church
[11:38] to keep he says to keep the church in
[11:40] line with the word. He says apostles,
[11:43] prophets, teachers, evangelists, offices
[11:45] of the church. God sent not man called
[11:48] God sent inspired men to keep the church
[11:50] lined up. And then he says gifts of the
[11:53] spirit in the church. not a bunch of
[11:56] fanaticism but truly gifts of the spirit
[11:58] in the church keeping the church. So
[12:01] this is where brother Brandham even
[12:03] shows how important it is to have god-
[12:06] sent God-called wordbased uh gifts in
[12:09] the church to keep the church lined up.
[12:11] Otherwise there can be a lot of
[12:12] fanaticism surrounded around gifts in
[12:15] the church because he says gifts of the
[12:17] spirit not a bunch of fanaticism but
[12:19] true gifts of the spirit keep the church
[12:21] in order and keep it in line. In the
[12:24] sermon, God's provided way for this day,
[12:26] he asked the question, what is a gift?
[12:29] And he says, a gift is just get yourself
[12:31] out of the way and let the Holy Spirit
[12:32] use you. That's the gift. My dad used to
[12:35] tell me that the gift is not getting
[12:37] started. The gift is ending.
[12:40] And so that was his take on the gift.
[12:43] Now, I guess that way if you can end a
[12:44] sermon, you've got the gift. But he says
[12:46] that's what a minister is. He don't
[12:48] preach what he wants to preach. He gets
[12:50] himself out of the way. It's a gift. And
[12:53] inspiration comes and he speaks through
[12:55] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[12:57] Another any other gift is the same way.
[12:59] So we can look any gift is to not put
[13:01] yourself in the way but to get out of
[13:03] the way. He says ministerial gifts and
[13:05] so forth have been there is first
[13:07] God-given gifts first apostles,
[13:09] prophets, teachers, pastors and
[13:11] evangelist evangelists. That's the
[13:13] offices that is our gifts. So those are
[13:17] the gifts to the church. This is
[13:19] something that we can all say are our
[13:21] gifts. Do all speak with tongues? No. Do
[13:23] all prophesy? No. But the church has
[13:26] received these gifts and these are
[13:28] something that we can participate in and
[13:30] we can enjoy from. And this is why Paul
[13:32] is leaving Titus to ordain things that
[13:35] are necessary. Apostles, prophets,
[13:37] teachers, pastors, evangelists. He said
[13:39] these offices are our gifts. In the
[13:42] sermon, I perceive you are a prophet. He
[13:44] says to bring up faith in Christ, there
[13:46] are ministers. And he makes this
[13:48] statement and uh I am very happy to
[13:50] share it with you. That's the most
[13:51] important thing of the day is a good
[13:53] God-scent preacher. And we can all
[13:55] debate on whether it's I'm good,
[13:56] God-scent, or even a preacher. But he
[13:59] says that's the most important thing of
[14:00] the day is a good God-scent preacher. I
[14:03] admire them. Their gift is far beyond
[14:04] anything that can be done in anything
[14:05] else is a preacher. A man who knows how
[14:08] to rightly divide the word of God. So
[14:10] these things were needful in for the
[14:13] churches that were being established in
[14:15] Cree. And it was something that Paul
[14:16] says, "I've got to go, but Titus, I'm
[14:18] going to leave you here so that you can
[14:20] ordain pastors in every city or in the
[14:23] churches that are being established in
[14:25] each one of these localities on this
[14:27] island." So that's the basis and the
[14:28] background for what Paul is doing. And
[14:31] by reading the statements of Brother
[14:32] Brandon, we could see that if brother
[14:34] Brandon preached the same gospel Paul
[14:35] preached, we could assume that Paul saw
[14:38] some of these same needs and believed in
[14:40] the same thing. And that's why he's
[14:42] teaching, training, establishing, and
[14:44] even pla even even placing Titus in that
[14:46] role. Not that Paul would be a one-man
[14:49] ministry controlling everything and
[14:50] dominating everything, but he could
[14:52] train and raise up and teach Titus to
[14:54] bring the gospel to those that Paul
[14:56] couldn't reach. So in verse six, we see
[14:59] then these qualifications for these
[15:02] elders that Titus is to ordain. So now
[15:05] Paul is wanting Titus to accomplish this
[15:08] great need, to fulfill this great need.
[15:10] And so as a as a teacher, as a a
[15:12] prophet, apostle, he's teaching Titus
[15:15] what to look for and those that he
[15:18] should place as a pastor. I heard one
[15:20] pastor do this one time and he said,
[15:22] "When you elect a pastor, be sure that
[15:24] he owns a truck."
[15:26] I haven't found that in the Greek here
[15:28] yet, but those are what someone will do
[15:30] when they want someone to have a
[15:32] successor or they're placing what they
[15:33] think the requirements are. Here is what
[15:35] Paul is say doing. He says, "If any,"
[15:38] this is a man, "if any be blameless."
[15:40] One that you're wanting to place in this
[15:42] office of pastor, "If any be blameless,
[15:44] the husband of one wife, having faithful
[15:46] children, not accused of right or
[15:48] unruly, they should," he's saying that
[15:49] these leaders should be above reproach,
[15:51] that they ought to be faithful in their
[15:53] relationships, raising responsible
[15:55] children. For a bishop must be blameless
[15:58] as a steward of God. They should be
[16:00] trustworthy,
[16:01] not self-willed,
[16:03] not soon angry, not given to whine, no
[16:06] striker, not given to filthy Lucer. You
[16:08] could see that he's someone that's going
[16:09] to be unselfish, self-controlled. He's
[16:11] going to avoid excess or violence and
[16:13] greed. These are all characteristics of
[16:16] one that Titus should be placing in this
[16:19] office of an elder, but a lover of
[16:20] hospitality, a lover of good men. So,
[16:23] he's welcoming. He values goodness. He's
[16:25] sober, just, holy, tempered. He upholds
[16:28] justice and integrity, holding fast the
[16:30] faithful word as he has been taught. So
[16:32] he's one that has been taught. He's
[16:34] holding fast that faithful word that he
[16:36] may be able to by sound doctrine both to
[16:38] exhort and to convince the gains by
[16:41] holding up reliable teachings. He can
[16:43] encourage others. He can teach the
[16:45] believer and he can also refute false
[16:47] ideas. So hold that faith forward that
[16:50] you've been taught because it's by sound
[16:51] doctrine. It's by sound doctrine that
[16:53] you build up and you can even refute the
[16:56] critics. Only by sound doctrine, not by
[16:58] fanaticism, but by sound doctrine. And
[17:01] verse 10 gives us a little bit more
[17:04] context for this. I hope the summer can
[17:07] be pretty dry, right? So, I hope my
[17:09] sermon isn't drier than this summer.
[17:13] Maybe if you can put it in that context,
[17:15] maybe you realize maybe my sermon isn't
[17:16] as dry as you think it is.
[17:19] Says, "For there are," this is the
[17:21] reason why. Verse 10, for there are many
[17:22] unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
[17:26] especially they of the circumcision. So
[17:28] there's Jews on this island that he's
[17:31] saying the these now having believe in
[17:34] Judaism but now having kind of been
[17:36] married to this Greek culture and
[17:37] certain things there's many unruly vain
[17:40] talkers and deceivers even circumcised
[17:42] Jews who are these unruly they're
[17:45] disruptive they're deceptive individuals
[17:46] especially among those who claim special
[17:49] authority who claim to be of the
[17:51] circumcision he says whose mouths must
[17:53] be stopped they must be addressed
[17:55] because he's saying they spread these
[17:57] harmful teachings
[17:58] A and they do it for personal gain.
[18:00] Whose mouth must be stopped. Who subvert
[18:03] whole houses teaching things which they
[18:05] ought not for filthy Lucer's sake. This
[18:08] is the this is the scene. This is the
[18:10] context. This is the plot uh to this
[18:13] what Paul is trying to express here at
[18:15] the beginning of this epistle to Titus.
[18:17] Titus is going to be entrusted with
[18:20] ordaining pastors in every city where
[18:22] there were believers. The reason why is
[18:24] because they need to be taught the word
[18:26] of God. Then the believers are going to
[18:28] be relying upon gifted men of God who
[18:31] can rightly divide the word of God. And
[18:32] we can see some of these similar things
[18:34] said to Timothy to promote faith and
[18:36] virtue and to bring these things out in
[18:38] the believer's lives. And then he
[18:40] himself must be above reproach so that
[18:42] the believer can receive them. And that
[18:44] he himself must be of a cert certain
[18:46] temperament to lead and to guide and to
[18:48] also
[18:50] live a life before the people and before
[18:53] those outside of the faith so that he
[18:55] can by sound doctrine, not by argument
[18:57] or violence, but by sound doctrine
[18:59] refute criticisms or falsities that are
[19:03] shared against the church or even uh the
[19:05] word of God. Titus was a a special
[19:08] person. We've read before in Galatians
[19:10] chapter 2 how he was a Greek that Paul
[19:13] was not going to compel him to be
[19:15] circumcised. And you see, well, what
[19:17] need would have he had to be circumcised
[19:19] if he's going to be a pastor where on a
[19:21] Greek island if he's going to be a
[19:22] bishop and a leader here, placing
[19:24] pastors of the Greeks or Gentiles? Titus
[19:27] 1:4, Paul calls him his own son after
[19:31] the common faith. These are just some
[19:32] details about about Paul about Titus.
[19:38] It says in 2 Corinthians chapter 2, he
[19:41] says, "I found Titus to be or he speaks
[19:43] of Titus as being his brother." In
[19:46] chapter 8, he says, "He's my partner and
[19:48] fellow helper concerning you." And he
[19:50] says, "He's a messenger of the church
[19:53] and the glory of Christ." This is high
[19:55] praise for Titus. He's one that is a
[19:57] messenger of the church. He's a
[19:58] messenger of the glory of Christ. He is
[20:00] this prophet's partner and fellow
[20:02] helper. He is Paul's brother. He is his
[20:04] son in the common faith. These are all
[20:06] the ways that Paul expresses the
[20:09] relationship that Titus had to him. So
[20:11] Titus is his son. He is his fellow
[20:13] helper. He is his partner. He is a
[20:15] messenger to the church. He is a
[20:17] messenger of the glory of Christ.
[20:21] And to prepare Titus, he wants to give
[20:24] him context. Titus has the special task
[20:27] of being sure that the right kind of man
[20:29] is going to lead those churches, lead
[20:31] those believers and not just in church
[20:33] order or just to be able to kind of have
[20:35] nice gatherings and good meals
[20:37] afterwards, but to teach them the word
[20:39] of God so that they could be brought.
[20:41] It's a ministry of perfection. Brother
[20:42] Bram called it God's dressear in the
[20:45] church. It's how God declares his
[20:47] presence in the church. And so to
[20:50] prepare Titus, he gives him context and
[20:53] he he tells he's telling Titus, "This is
[20:55] what you should be looking for and this
[20:56] is what you're choosing from." This to
[20:58] me is the part that we're bringing up
[21:00] to. He wants to share his opinion and
[21:01] observation of the cretins or
[21:03] Christians, however you might want to
[21:04] say it. And this is what he says in
[21:06] verse 12. So now we've arrived at verse
[21:08] 12. It's smooth sailing from here. I
[21:11] hope
[21:13] now as he has said that these unruly and
[21:15] vain talkers and deceivers of the
[21:17] circumcisions mouths must be stopped.
[21:19] Now he says of the cretins themselves
[21:21] the creations themselves one of
[21:23] themselves even a prophet. He calls this
[21:25] person a prophet of their own. The
[21:28] cretans are always liars evil beast slow
[21:31] bellies. This is attributed to
[21:33] Epimenities that he is a prophet, a poet
[21:36] and a philosopher from Cree. Semi-
[21:39] mythical as we mentioned before. He's
[21:41] said to be one of the seven sages or
[21:44] seven wise men or should be is how one
[21:46] writer wrote it. He was a friend of
[21:47] salon. He was a Greek state Greek
[21:49] statements statesman and lawgiver.
[21:52] And I guess this is part of the
[21:54] mythology is said to have cleansed
[21:56] Athens of a plague. And this is told by
[21:59] a Spartan in Plato's laws. As Plato is
[22:02] giving this dialogue, it's a
[22:04] conversation between three elderly men
[22:06] on political philosophy. So, if we could
[22:08] just turn to Plato's laws, I'd like to
[22:10] read the dialogue.
[22:14] I've never read it, so I'm not going to
[22:15] read it. Don't own it, but uh it's one
[22:17] of the most important surviving works of
[22:19] ancient Greek political thought. And in
[22:22] this, so this is a source. This is where
[22:23] we have it because Plato shared this in
[22:26] this dialogue. and as he's sharing this
[22:27] and it's a very uh Plato's laws is a
[22:30] very uh uh important piece to the
[22:33] Greeks. Epimenities is credited with
[22:35] writing a poem. I'll read it in a
[22:37] moment. But he's also credited with
[22:38] writing oracles and poems and uh pros
[22:41] and poetries. He's accredited with a lot
[22:42] of many different works. And Epimenities
[22:45] believed that the lie of the Cretians
[22:47] was that Zeus was mortal. So Epimenities
[22:51] believed that Zeus was immortal. And so
[22:53] the Cretians believed that Zeus was born
[22:56] on a mountain created on a mountain. So
[22:58] Epimenities believed the lie was that
[23:00] Zeus was mortal. So he wrote this pro
[23:02] poem Credica and it says they fashioned
[23:04] a tomb for thee, oh high and holy one.
[23:07] The cretins or cretins always liars,
[23:11] evil beast, idle bellies,
[23:14] but thou are not dead. Thou livest and
[23:16] abidest forever. For in thee we live and
[23:18] move and have our being. So it's
[23:21] Epimenities who says that the Cretians
[23:23] are always liars, evil beasts,
[23:26] slowbellies, idle bellies. This is
[23:28] exactly who Paul is quoting when he says
[23:30] one of their own prophets, one of their
[23:32] own philosophers, one of their own poet
[23:34] says the Christians are always liars,
[23:36] evil beasts, slowbellies. So this is the
[23:38] phrase is drawn from this ancient poem
[23:41] Citica. It's also Calamakus in a hymn to
[23:44] Zeus said cretins are ever liars. Yay, a
[23:47] tomb, O Lord, for thee the cretins
[23:48] builded, but thou didest not die, for
[23:50] thou art forever. So it's in these
[23:53] different ancient poems in Greek
[23:55] mythology that this statement is made.
[23:58] The Cretians are liars, evil beast,
[24:00] slowbellies.
[24:01] Several early Christian writers credit
[24:03] Epimenities as Paul's a poet or prophet
[24:06] that he draws from Clement of
[24:07] Alexandria, St. Jerome, a lot of them
[24:09] wrote in those early period of the
[24:11] church saying Paul got this from
[24:12] Epimenities poem.
[24:15] Now think about this. I know that this
[24:16] sermon isn't going to be much longer
[24:18] than it has been already. So, we can
[24:20] just kind of relax and realize that
[24:21] there is an end to this torture.
[24:24] Through suffering comes character, and
[24:26] it's my job to make you suffer
[24:27] sometimes.
[24:29] But, but character will be your gain.
[24:32] Paul quotes, now just think about this.
[24:34] In reality, he quotes a pagan
[24:36] philosopher, a heathen prophet, a false
[24:40] poet, we want to use that, who wrote a
[24:43] poem to worship Zeus.
[24:46] He wrote a poem in defense of a
[24:48] mythological creature, one that they
[24:50] thought was real. And they had this
[24:51] story to him. And he's a god. He's
[24:53] forever. Oh Lord, for thee. Uh they
[24:56] built a tomb for you, but you never
[24:57] died. Thou art forever. The creations
[24:59] are liars. They fashioned a tomb for
[25:02] thee, oh high and holy one. But they're
[25:05] liars. Evil beast, slow bellies. You are
[25:06] not dead. You live and abide forever.
[25:09] For in thee we live and move and have
[25:10] our being. He's Paul is quoting a hymn,
[25:15] a secular song. He's quoting from AC/DC,
[25:21] right?
[25:22] This is him using He's quoting from the
[25:25] worst of the worst.
[25:28] Rolling Stone sympathy to the devil or
[25:30] for the devil. What is it? You tell me.
[25:33] He's quoting from that to say
[25:36] to make his point.
[25:39] And in Athens in Acts se 17, if you
[25:41] didn't listen to Wednesday night, you
[25:42] don't need to go back. I don't need the
[25:43] clicks. But if you want to get some com
[25:46] uh some context for this, in Acts
[25:48] chapter 17, to those at Athens, the
[25:50] hearers would have immediately
[25:51] associated this hymn with their worship.
[25:54] Immediately, many of them would have
[25:55] been these learned men, these ones that
[25:57] came to debate, these wannabe
[25:58] philosophers, whoever it would have
[25:59] been, they would have been like, "That's
[26:01] Eimenities.
[26:02] That's Calanthus. This is this is part
[26:04] of our mythology. The high and holy one
[26:06] is Zeus. This is Jupiter. This is Jove.
[26:10] And here Paul is using it very
[26:12] intentionally, very carefully. He's
[26:15] using it to enlighten Titus to the
[26:17] character of those that he's dealing
[26:18] with. He's using it to enlighten him to
[26:21] the very character of those that he
[26:23] wants the word to have an impact on.
[26:26] Their poor character was well known in
[26:29] uh historically the three worst Ks. You
[26:32] thought there was a worst KKK. The three
[26:34] worst case was cretins, capidocians and
[26:36] calissians.
[26:38] There's a phrase to play the Any
[26:40] anyone ever heard that? To play the
[26:42] It means to play the cheat and
[26:44] liar. Have quite the quite the
[26:48] reputation. Palibius, I know a lot of
[26:50] you follow him. He's an ancient Greek
[26:52] Greek historian from 2 century BC. He
[26:54] wrote the histories. He said the cretins
[26:56] on account of their innate avarice live
[26:59] in a perpetual state of private quarrel
[27:01] and public feud and civil stri strife. I
[27:05] want this on a bumper sticker. The
[27:07] cretins on account of their innate
[27:08] avarice live in a perpetual state of
[27:11] private quarrel and public feud and
[27:13] civil stri strife. I don't know why I
[27:15] keep saying stries. Strife. And you will
[27:18] hardly find anywhere characters more
[27:21] tricky and deceitful than those of the
[27:24] cretins.
[27:26] We need to do a 23 and me on some
[27:27] people.
[27:32] The prophet used the philosophers to
[27:35] make a point.
[27:36] He's making the point about the cretins
[27:38] for the benefit of Titus to know who it
[27:41] is that he's dealing with. He used their
[27:44] philosophers. He used their poets. He
[27:45] used their prophets to declare not just
[27:48] the context for Titus, but to declare
[27:50] the gospel to those who would believe.
[27:52] Right. In him we live and move and have
[27:55] our being. It's a line borrowed from
[27:58] this ancient poem and hymn to Zeus. And
[28:00] uh the cretins are always liars, evil
[28:02] beasts, idle bellies. He's borrowing
[28:04] this from the very observation of their
[28:06] own philosopher. The prophet is using
[28:08] these things not to show like he's like
[28:10] a Dennis Miller who can get enough pop
[28:12] culture references in in 5 seconds and
[28:13] an auctioneer can get in in 30 minutes.
[28:15] No, that's not the point. The point was
[28:17] to try to get something over to the
[28:19] people's hearts. Right.
[28:22] To me, this is a really a neat part. I
[28:25] share this with you just to see how how
[28:29] much nuance Paul is using and how
[28:30] sometimes when a prophet says something,
[28:32] we need we want to really understand
[28:34] what's behind it. Understand what he's
[28:37] trying to say. The Christians are always
[28:39] liars or the phrase is put all cretins
[28:41] are liars is a famous how many you know
[28:44] what this is the famous philosophical
[28:46] paradox.
[28:48] The epimemenities paradox. It creates a
[28:49] paradox of self-reference because or
[28:52] it's called a liars paradox is how some
[28:54] of you may know about this because a
[28:55] cretton makes the claim that all cretins
[28:58] are liars.
[29:00] You following me? Stick with me. If
[29:03] epimemenities states that all statements
[29:06] made by a are false since
[29:09] Epimenities is a his statement is
[29:13] false
[29:14] and not all cretins are liars. You
[29:16] confused yet?
[29:20] Let's look at the next one. This might
[29:21] help you. I appreciate the support,
[29:22] brother Joshua. I I need all the help I
[29:24] can get right now.
[29:27] This sentence is false.
[29:30] If this sentence is true, then it is
[29:32] false.
[29:34] And if it is false, then it is true.
[29:38] Right?
[29:39] This is what Paul is quoting. He's
[29:41] quoting from a who says all
[29:42] Christians are liars. Then we think, oh,
[29:45] there's a paradox here.
[29:48] This sentence is false is one it's a
[29:51] paradox. It creates this kind of what
[29:52] what do we do with this? A Greek
[29:53] philosopher in the 4th century BC said a
[29:56] man that says he is lying is what he
[29:57] says is what he says true or false. So
[30:01] this is again Paul is drawing from
[30:03] something that would have been a a
[30:05] riddle of their time would have been a
[30:07] paradox something something to be
[30:10] wrestled with. But let's look at Psalms
[30:12] 116 11.
[30:16] David said, 'I said in my haste,
[30:19] my excitement, all men are liars.
[30:24] Wow, we escaped. We escaped one there,
[30:27] brothers. That was the chance they'd all
[30:29] been waiting. They probably even had it
[30:30] highlighted if it's ever mentioned in
[30:31] church. I'm going to say amen as loud as
[30:34] I can.
[30:38] I That reminds me of the tweet where
[30:40] someone says, "If if a man a lady
[30:42] tweeted and said, if a man agrees with
[30:43] you, you're stupid." I think was the
[30:45] phrase. and a man said, "Uh, you're
[30:46] right." in response. And it's kind,
[30:49] well, that one's over. So, uh, St.
[30:53] Jerome in the homalies of the Psalms,
[30:55] 4th century AD, he writes, "Is David
[30:57] telling the truth or is he lying?" I
[30:59] know you're you're probably wondering,
[30:59] "Where am I going with this?" Stick with
[31:01] me. Is he telling the truth or is he
[31:03] lying? All men are liars. Well, is David
[31:05] telling the truth or is he lying? If it
[31:06] is true that every man is a liar and
[31:08] David's statement every man is a liar
[31:11] then David and David's statement is true
[31:13] that David also is lying. He too is a
[31:16] man. But if he too is lying his
[31:18] statement that every man is a liar
[31:19] consequently is not true.
[31:23] Whatever you turn to turn to the
[31:25] proposition the conclusion is a
[31:26] contradiction. Since David himself is a
[31:28] man it follows that he is also lying.
[31:30] But if he's lying because every man is a
[31:32] liar his lying is a different of a
[31:34] different sort.
[31:36] You said this these are things that
[31:38] people wrestle with and they think
[31:39] about. We're thinking this is what I'm
[31:41] trying to get away from brother Aaron in
[31:43] church. But Paul puts it right in front
[31:45] of us and he quotes the liars paradox.
[31:48] He quotes Epimemenities paradox. These
[31:50] are famous things maybe in academic
[31:51] circles and now it's a part of our
[31:53] circle and he says the cretins are
[31:56] always liars.
[31:58] Accretion has said this. It creates this
[32:00] paradox. Paradox is he lying? If he's
[32:02] lying then they're not all liars. Then
[32:04] it's true.
[32:06] But then Paul says in verse 13, see I
[32:08] had my backup here. This witness is
[32:11] true. He's playing the game. He's he's
[32:15] wrestling out the paradox. This witness
[32:18] is true. So he says, "Wherefore rebuke
[32:21] them sharply that they be may be sound
[32:24] in the faith."
[32:28] Paul quotes a famous paradox. He quotes
[32:31] their philosopher, their poet, their
[32:32] prophet. And the prophet confirms the
[32:36] philosopher in almost the same
[32:38] paradoxical manner. Yes, he said they're
[32:41] liars and what he's saying is true,
[32:45] but he doesn't affirm all the
[32:46] philosophers have said.
[32:49] He's not saying, "Oh, he is a true
[32:51] prophet." But he's doing it with respect
[32:53] to the character of the creations. So,
[32:56] he's being very careful with very
[32:58] careful and prudent attention. Paul is
[33:00] using the writings of the heathen poets
[33:04] for for the benefit of the believers. So
[33:08] he says rebuke them sharply. In other
[33:10] words, gentleness isn't going to impact
[33:12] these kind of people that the know your
[33:15] audience being gentle and this approach
[33:17] and this way that you might want to take
[33:18] it's not going to persuade them.
[33:23] And he's saying this to Titus not that
[33:26] he would try to persuade the sinner,
[33:28] reach the sinner on the testimony of
[33:30] popular culture, on philosophers, but
[33:32] based upon the prophet's confirmation.
[33:36] You I want you to catch this. The
[33:37] prophet's the one that quotes it and
[33:39] says this witness is true. It's upon
[33:41] this basis that you can convince them.
[33:43] Not on the basis of pop culture, not on
[33:45] the basis of philosophy, but on the
[33:47] basis of what the prophet has confirmed.
[33:49] This is a lesson to us to recognize
[33:52] there's a way that we want to follow in
[33:54] the word of God to know how to reach
[33:55] Leodysa through the voice to that age.
[33:59] He says, "Rebuke them cuddly. Cut them
[34:01] to the quick, spare them not."
[34:04] It's quite a statement that he gives
[34:06] Titus to rebuke them sharply because
[34:08] this witness is true.
[34:10] Whereas to the Colossians, he says in
[34:12] 4:6, "Let your speech be always with
[34:15] grace, seasoned with salt, that you may
[34:17] know how you ought to answer every man."
[34:21] Seems to be a contradiction. But
[34:23] sometimes the setting, the context
[34:26] demands a certain response. Not that it
[34:29] would be in anger, not that it would be
[34:30] raffle, not that it would be void of the
[34:32] character of the gospel, not that it
[34:34] would go past the bounds of the word of
[34:36] God. But he says, "Rebuke them sharply
[34:38] because this is the kind of character
[34:39] they are. The the sophist, the arguers,
[34:42] the ones that have such innate avarice
[34:45] and civil strife
[34:48] in a perpetual state of private quarrel
[34:50] and public feud,
[34:53] but yet you have to know how to answer
[34:54] every man."
[34:57] So he continues in Titus chapter 1
[34:59] verse14,
[35:01] not giving heed to Jewish fables and
[35:04] commandments of men that turn from the
[35:07] truth.
[35:09] Jewish fables, it could have been
[35:11] translated to Jewish mythology, Jewish
[35:13] narratives or stories. He's saying these
[35:16] myths detract from the essential truths
[35:19] of the gospel.
[35:21] not giving heed to Jewish fables that
[35:24] turn you away from the truth. In Titus
[35:27] 3:9, he says, "Avoid foolish questions
[35:29] and genealogies and contentions and
[35:31] strivings about the law, for they are
[35:33] unprofitable and vain."
[35:39] 1 Timothy 1:4, "Neither give heed to
[35:41] fables and endless genealogies which
[35:43] minister questions rather than godly
[35:45] edifying which is in faith."
[35:48] So he's given a lot of context to Titus.
[35:51] Rebuke them sharply, but don't give heed
[35:53] to Jewish fables. So he says, "Avoid
[35:55] foolish questions." We're told that we
[35:57] ought to know how to answer every man,
[35:59] but we want to avoid foolish questions,
[36:02] strivings with and debates and
[36:04] genealogies and all this maybe uh
[36:07] historical perfection and accuracy,
[36:09] whatever it is it might entail, which
[36:10] minister questions rather than to edify.
[36:14] Chapter 4:7. But refuse profane and old
[36:17] wives fables and exercise thyself rather
[36:20] unto godliness.
[36:26] 2 Timothy 4:es 2 to4 he says preach the
[36:29] word. This is what it comes down to.
[36:31] It's what he told Timothy. This is what
[36:33] he's want Titus to do. Preach the word.
[36:35] Be instant in season out of season.
[36:36] Reprove rebuke exhort with all
[36:38] longsuffering and doctrine. For the time
[36:40] will come when they will not endure
[36:42] sound doctrine. But after their own lust
[36:45] shall they heap to themselves teachers,
[36:46] philosophers, having itching ears, and
[36:49] they shall turn away their ears from the
[36:52] truth and shall be turned unto fables.
[36:56] These distractions cause these
[36:58] unnecessary disputes and confusion
[37:00] rather than building up the faith is
[37:02] what he's sharing. And when I read this,
[37:06] if I if we look at Acts chapter 17 and
[37:09] even as background for what he says
[37:11] here, one of their own prophets, one of
[37:14] their own poets, one of their own
[37:15] philosophers has said, "The Christians
[37:16] are always liars, evil beast,
[37:18] slowbellies, and this paradox is true.
[37:21] This statement is true." And then he
[37:23] says, "Don't give heed to Jewish
[37:24] fables."
[37:26] It's a huge paradox because he just used
[37:29] mythology and pagan philosophy then
[37:31] warns against mythology.
[37:34] What a that's very meta. Is that what we
[37:36] call it today?
[37:38] But it makes the point. He's using it to
[37:41] make the point
[37:43] that these things there's a distraction
[37:46] to these things. There's an insanity to
[37:48] these things. There's a there there's a
[37:50] a direction that these things are going.
[37:52] And you want to know what has captured
[37:54] the minds and the hearts of those people
[37:55] so that you can reach them with the
[37:57] gospel. Not that you want your heart or
[37:59] your mind to be captured by it. Our job
[38:01] is to rebuke and resist the spirit of
[38:03] the age, not catch it.
[38:06] In the sermon influence, now just coming
[38:08] to my my stretch here to close this in
[38:11] the sermon influence.
[38:16] Listen to how brother Brandham places
[38:18] this. I have just a few quotations here
[38:20] and a couple of more scriptures to
[38:22] share. I I want you to recognize what he
[38:25] brings us back to.
[38:28] Every man is looking to see where he
[38:29] come from and what he's doing here and
[38:31] where he is going after this. You
[38:34] reading along here, Brother Jack? Every
[38:36] man is looking to see where he come from
[38:37] and what he's doing here and where he's
[38:39] going after this. And we've had many
[38:41] fine books written. I've just read some
[38:43] fine books in my life of man's
[38:45] philosophy and things. But although as
[38:47] good as them books may be, there's only
[38:49] one book that can tell you where you
[38:51] come from, what you are, and where
[38:54] you're going. And that's this book, the
[38:57] Bible. There's one place that we can
[38:59] have this confidence that tells us where
[39:01] we came from, where we're going, and
[39:02] what we are right now. That's the Bible.
[39:04] There's a lot of fine books out there.
[39:06] There's a lot of fine books that Brother
[39:07] Brandham quoted from. There's a lot of
[39:09] stories he tells uh that came from the
[39:11] Prince of the House of David. There's
[39:13] stories he tells that you can find from
[39:14] this book. There's examples he gives you
[39:16] can find straight from commentaries.
[39:18] There's times where he preaches a sermon
[39:19] and you can follow the notes in
[39:21] Scoffield, right? I mean, what is he
[39:24] doing at the end of the day? He brings
[39:25] us back to one thing. No matter where it
[39:27] came from, no matter what it belongs to,
[39:28] whether you want to say it's Greek
[39:30] mythology or whether or not you want to
[39:31] say it's this Hinduism or it's this or
[39:33] it's that or it's from this commentary
[39:35] or that, we come back to the Bible as
[39:37] being the only book that can tell you
[39:39] where you came from, who you are, and
[39:40] where you're going. And the word is God.
[39:43] We believe in that book and that's what
[39:45] we want to stand for in this day.
[39:49] And it's a promise in there that that we
[39:51] should be made known who we are, where
[39:53] we come from, and where we are going.
[39:55] There's a promise that it will be made
[39:56] known of who you are, where you came
[40:00] from, and where you're going. This Bible
[40:01] declares this and reveals it. It's to be
[40:03] opened up in this last day so we can
[40:05] know who we are, where we came from, and
[40:07] where we're going. Do you realize those
[40:09] creations there on that island had been
[40:11] taught a mythology and they had these
[40:13] competing lies and they would debate,
[40:15] "No, there's a grave for Zeus. No, Zeus
[40:16] is not immortal. Zeus is mortal." And
[40:19] there would be a debate about something
[40:20] that is false. They'd have their
[40:22] homalies and their hymns and they'd have
[40:24] their stories and they'd have all their
[40:26] details to express all these things that
[40:28] relate to uh uh psychology and
[40:30] mythology. And Paul is saying, "You guys
[40:33] are completely missing it.
[40:35] There's one true God." Amen. He's that
[40:38] unknown God that you speak of. He it is
[40:41] that was written of who's high and holy.
[40:43] He it is that will never die and he's
[40:47] the one that sent his son. There's only
[40:48] one book that's the Bible.
[40:51] The sermon God hiding himself in
[40:52] simplicity then revealing himself in the
[40:54] same. He says today we preach
[40:56] philosophy. He's not referring to
[40:57] himself. He's referring to Christianity
[40:59] as a collective. They're preaching
[41:02] philosophy. We preach creed and
[41:03] denominationalism in so many things and
[41:06] leaving off the word. Why is it that
[41:09] people preach philosophy, creed,
[41:10] denominationalism?
[41:12] I I was trying to think of a punny title
[41:14] with the phrase Iran
[41:17] just to be relevant because we all know
[41:19] that the message is for a fact 100%
[41:22] vindicated now that they dropped a
[41:25] bunker bomb on Iran.
[41:28] Today we preach philosophy, we preach
[41:30] creed and denominationalism and so many
[41:31] things and leaving out the word because
[41:32] they say it can't be understood. He says
[41:35] it can be understood. He promised to do
[41:38] it. Now we're asking him to do it. What
[41:40] are we asking him to do? To reveal to us
[41:42] where make to be made known to us who we
[41:44] are, where we come from, and where we're
[41:46] going. To resolve the questions of
[41:48] history. To resolve the inconsistencies
[41:50] with mythology. To resolve to us who we
[41:53] are, where we came from, and where we're
[41:54] going. All mythology and all religion
[41:56] has tried to satisfy that question.
[41:58] Right? That's what philosophy will tell
[42:00] you. That's what the critics will tell
[42:01] you is that all these things were made
[42:03] and invented to plate man's sense of
[42:05] wondering. But God has promised that he
[42:08] will reveal it to us.
[42:11] We cannot preach philosophy
[42:14] with the excuse that you can't
[42:16] understand the word of God. He promised
[42:18] to give us understanding. Oh, you can't
[42:20] understand it. What does that leave us
[42:21] with? It just leaves us with history. It
[42:24] just leaves us with a pressing play. It
[42:26] leaves us without the Holy Spirit that
[42:28] can reveal it to us.
[42:31] So in verse 15,
[42:35] we'll read to verse
[42:37] 16. You could continue with chapter 2
[42:39] and three. It's a very short book. You
[42:41] could read it uh and finish because he
[42:43] begins to tell him, "So with this light,
[42:45] speak things which become sound
[42:47] doctrine." And then he has teachings for
[42:49] the men, the women.
[42:52] And he and he tells them
[42:56] he's telling Titus how he ought to
[42:57] conduct himself in light of those he's
[42:59] surrounded by. But just to finish this
[43:01] thought
[43:03] on these vain talkers,
[43:06] unto the pure, all things are pure.
[43:09] You're pure in heart by faith. To the
[43:12] pure all things are pure. Where does it
[43:14] begin? In your heart by revelation. But
[43:16] unto them that are defiled and
[43:17] unbelieving is nothing pure, but even
[43:19] their mind and their conscience is
[43:20] defiled. When you are free in your soul,
[43:24] free from traditions of men and the law
[43:26] of the flesh, these things that Paul's
[43:27] referring to, then all things are pure.
[43:29] But to them that are defiled, they're
[43:31] inwardly impure by sin. It touches
[43:33] everything. Regardless of their
[43:34] confession, regardless of what they
[43:36] believe,
[43:38] to them nothing is pure.
[43:41] They profess that they know God, but in
[43:44] works they deny them. One commentary
[43:47] referred to a statement of Caesar having
[43:49] the name of Romans while they had the
[43:50] manners of the Gauls. I have no idea
[43:52] what that means, but it makes the point.
[43:54] They may call themselves Christians, but
[43:56] they don't act like it. They may say
[43:58] that they're Romans, but they're not
[43:59] civilized. They act like the Gauls. Here
[44:02] they profess that they know God, but in
[44:03] works they deny him being abominable and
[44:05] disobedient and unto every good work
[44:08] reprobate.
[44:10] Quite an enlightening to Titus. got an
[44:13] understanding of context to know who his
[44:15] audience was, what he's sifting through,
[44:17] there may be a certain amount of
[44:18] pretense outwardly, but know that if
[44:20] inwardly they're not pure, to them
[44:22] everything is defiled.
[44:25] Brothers, you could come to your
[44:26] instruments if you would like just to
[44:28] read one final statement from an
[44:30] absolute
[44:36] Paul.
[44:39] Paul used
[44:42] one of their own prophets, pagan
[44:44] prophet, not a true prophet.
[44:47] He quoted their own poets.
[44:52] He uses a philosophical paradox to make
[44:54] a point.
[44:59] And what was his point? He's not
[45:01] pointing to the philosophies.
[45:04] He's not pointing to the pop culture.
[45:07] And if we're not careful, there's things
[45:08] that Brother says, there's things that
[45:10] he does. There's things that he points
[45:12] to or uses and people just take it and
[45:15] they want to run with it.
[45:17] And in running with it, they they they
[45:20] catch they catch the pop culture, not
[45:23] the point brother Brandon was making.
[45:25] They become very anti with respect to
[45:27] this and very harsh with respect to
[45:29] that, very loose with respect to this.
[45:30] And it's all because they didn't catch
[45:32] inwardly the revelation of the messes
[45:35] that Brother Brandon was trying to
[45:36] teach. Just even in that simple context,
[45:39] if you want fanaticism, if you want a
[45:41] certain bent, if you want a certain
[45:42] look, if you want to live a certain way,
[45:44] you can find it all within the Bible,
[45:47] you could just pick and choose. Find it
[45:49] within the context of the message. I
[45:51] want to be anti- this. I want to be pro
[45:53] that. But it's not the politics of it.
[45:57] We're not we're not gleaning things from
[45:59] the Bible and from the the message of
[46:01] the hour to support our political
[46:02] philosophies. I was thinking of
[46:04] modern-day philosophers and who they are
[46:06] today. And there might be a lot that we
[46:09] think in terms of modern times that have
[46:11] great names that are very renowned. And
[46:14] the more I thought about it, the more I
[46:16] was just reading about the philosophers
[46:18] of our time and what they would consider
[46:19] modern philosophers as opposed to h ones
[46:22] in ancient Greece,
[46:25] I began to think our philosophers
[46:26] anymore are not what we would call
[46:29] philosophers.
[46:31] philosophy is is is really, if I could
[46:33] just riff for a moment, it's really long
[46:36] form. We've been reduced to short form.
[46:41] And so our philosophers today tweet
[46:45] our philosophers, they don't do videos,
[46:48] they do shorts in reals, right? That's
[46:51] what that's the snippets. Those are the
[46:53] that doesn't give us any contemplation.
[46:56] that that's not that's not causing us to
[46:58] stop and to think and to consider and
[47:00] weigh things out. And so we're driven by
[47:04] sound bites, by air, by emotion, and not
[47:09] by the word.
[47:11] I think it's very important for us to be
[47:14] solidly rooted rooted on
[47:19] on the word of God. Amen. I had a a
[47:23] brother send me a text message today and
[47:26] he was just saying he said, "Man, I sure
[47:28] wish you'd stopped giving me some
[47:29] practical, applicable guidance on how to
[47:31] better reflect Jesus Christ in my day
[47:32] and day-to-day life and spend more time
[47:35] giving your opinion on these modern
[47:36] events."
[47:39] And he said, "Said no one ever." I was
[47:41] like, "Well, I appreciate that. I
[47:44] appreciate that. I felt like I should
[47:45] read that to you." I was like, "Well,
[47:47] that is my point. I want you know I want
[47:49] you to know how to overcome. Not my
[47:51] opinion on the last trump, not my
[47:53] opinion on the blood moons, not my
[47:54] opinion on the war in the Middle East.
[47:56] Whatever is going to happen is going to
[47:57] happen. You realize that, right?
[48:00] Whatever is going to happen is going to
[48:01] happen. And the more that we drink the
[48:03] poison of political fear and the more
[48:06] that we drink the philosophy of the
[48:08] Jordan Petersons and Joe Rogan's or
[48:10] whoever else our philosophers are, I
[48:12] imagine we don't have a lot of problems
[48:14] with the the liberal left here in terms
[48:16] of drinking their poison. It might tend
[48:18] to be more framed as Christianity and
[48:22] American rights. Where does that leave a
[48:25] believer in Croatia?
[48:28] If our message metric has become so much
[48:32] American ideology, where does that leave
[48:34] the believers in South Africa? Outside.
[48:38] And that's how you become more cultish.
[48:39] That's how become less Christlike.
[48:43] And it the more that we drink from that,
[48:45] the more that we're going to be sitting
[48:47] here in fear and chaos that surrounds
[48:50] us, nuclear bombs being detonated and a
[48:53] literal World War II unfolding before
[48:55] us. What's happening? I wasn't supposed
[48:56] to be here. That's right. You got your
[48:58] eyes on the wrong thing.
[49:00] And we're going to live in the in the
[49:02] shadows of all this torture until we can
[49:04] get our eyes solidly on the word of God
[49:06] to say, you know what? There's one thing
[49:07] that's going to get me out of here. And
[49:09] it's not the next president. It's the
[49:11] word of God that's come to us that we're
[49:13] believing and that we're feeding on.
[49:16] In the sermon, the absolute, brother Ben
[49:17] Brandham says, "When God gave a man the
[49:19] Holy Spirit," listen, this is so
[49:20] beautiful. He set him with his face
[49:22] towards Calvary and the word before him.
[49:26] That's where I have it now. Little roots
[49:29] will rise up from off that highway
[49:32] and come in and wrap around and around
[49:34] that tree. And you think it's very
[49:36] innocent.
[49:38] We're We're supposed to be on this
[49:39] highway. The word of God before us
[49:41] leading us our faith towards Calvary.
[49:42] But the first thing you know it's got
[49:44] such a hold on you until it pulls you
[49:45] the wrong way and makes you lean the
[49:47] wrong way. So much leaning today.
[49:52] We lean to this. We lean to that. He
[49:53] says, "And so has philosophies and
[49:56] things entered in among us. It's be to
[49:59] pull us towards the world." Philosophy's
[50:02] doing it.
[50:04] It's pulling us towards the world. You
[50:06] take the sharp two-edged sword of God
[50:08] and cut free from everything and stay
[50:10] right on that word because that is the
[50:12] ultimate. That's the absolute to every
[50:14] believer. He said to those and those I
[50:17] hope I'm believe leading. The Bible is
[50:19] our absolute.
[50:21] [Music]
[50:26] I can't remember where I heard this
[50:28] before. It might have even been said
[50:29] over our pulpit. But and I hope I get it
[50:31] right. just make this point that some
[50:34] people say the message comes from the
[50:36] Bible and this brother said it's the
[50:38] Bible coming from the message
[50:41] and that's what we have to catch. It
[50:43] comes back to the word of God. We've
[50:45] been given the word of God. That's our
[50:46] ultimate that's our absolute
[50:49] and we could say that Paul in some ways
[50:52] canonized forever
[50:55] a hymn to Zeus.
[50:57] He made the breath of God out of a hymn,
[51:02] a poem to Jo
[51:05] Jupiter.
[51:07] Some would read this, I think you
[51:08] spelled love wrong, or I think you
[51:09] spelled Jehovah wrong. No, these were
[51:12] pagan. And the prophet said, you've got
[51:14] it all wrong.
[51:16] The philosophers were trying to look
[51:18] into things they don't know. The poets
[51:19] were writing from inspiration they
[51:20] didn't understand, and they used it to
[51:22] apply it to all these other things.
[51:24] Today, it's applied to fanaticism. Today
[51:26] it's apply it's applied to carnality.
[51:28] Today it's applied to politics. We got
[51:29] to come back to the basis of the word of
[51:32] God because it's him that we're feeding
[51:33] on. It's him that we want to have a
[51:35] relationship. And I want to express this
[51:38] to you in this uh uh
[51:42] really odd and maybe unique way that
[51:44] we've delivered it even through these
[51:45] next these past two services. Wednesday
[51:47] night, Lord willing, I want to preach
[51:48] the prophet and the playwright. Amen.
[51:50] Find that one in the Bible. But it's in
[51:52] there just to see that God wants us to
[51:55] cut away from all these philosophies.
[52:00] Take the two. It may seem to be a
[52:01] paradox,
[52:02] but you take a sharp two-edged sword and
[52:04] find all the ideologies, all the
[52:06] mythologies, all the fables, all the
[52:08] myths, all the man-made inventions. Do
[52:10] you realize there's a litany of ma
[52:13] message myths
[52:15] that have created now? We've had a lot
[52:16] of years, decade after decade after
[52:18] decade. I was reading in one sermon. And
[52:21] it's this one I read here in the in in
[52:22] an absolute
[52:24] 20 years before you were born,
[52:28] Sister Elizabeth. I'm looking at her. 20
[52:30] years. You realize now where we sit
[52:31] today, we've been married for 20 years.
[52:34] And the nearness at that of where when
[52:36] we when we were born, when we started
[52:38] believing
[52:42] so far beyond
[52:44] and and so much has developed and
[52:47] evolved and become entrrenched into it.
[52:48] And I'm I'm asking you, how far away
[52:50] have we gotten from away from the true
[52:52] heartbeat of the word of God by
[52:54] maintaining the appearance
[52:56] of message? And that's why it cycles
[52:59] back into the same patterns that it
[53:01] always has. It's revival and death to
[53:04] those who don't catch the word of God.
[53:06] Yes, to the bride, the cycle's been
[53:08] broken. But to those who are not walking
[53:09] in the pattern, they'll cycle right back
[53:11] to vomit. They'll cycle right back to
[53:13] denominational patterns. They'll cycle
[53:14] right back to the thing the message
[53:16] called them out of. Whether it be
[53:17] Pentecostalism, emotionalism, or
[53:19] intellectualism, they'll go right back
[53:21] unless they have used the sword of the
[53:23] word of God to cut away all the
[53:24] philosophies, all the politics, and all
[53:26] the pretense that tries to pull you from
[53:28] the highway. Let's stand together and
[53:31] pray. Our gracious heavenly father,
[53:34] Lord, as we
[53:36] close this service, we ask for your
[53:37] grace once again. Lord, you call me to
[53:40] walk a tight rope
[53:43] to show how a prophet used the
[53:46] philosophers. The prophet used the poets
[53:49] to make a point.
[53:52] And not that he was given the seal of
[53:54] approval to digest Greek mythology,
[53:58] but he was able to take something that
[54:00] had blinded them
[54:03] to get their attention.
[54:07] And as he used that in Acts chapter 17
[54:10] there at the Athenians on Mars Hill and
[54:11] there was believers that were quickened
[54:14] to the word of God. Now Paul
[54:17] to his son, his fellow helper,
[54:20] his partner, a messenger to the church
[54:23] and a messenger of the glory of Christ.
[54:27] He tells him to ordain these pastors in
[54:30] every city, but whatever you do, don't
[54:32] appoint one
[54:34] who doesn't have the right kind of
[54:36] character.
[54:39] This is the character of the people.
[54:40] These are their attitudes. This is the
[54:41] way they think.
[54:44] That innate avarice,
[54:47] the civil strife,
[54:49] it lurks within them. Even their own
[54:52] prophet has said they're always liars.
[54:56] This witness is true.
[54:59] Titus as a Greek may have reveled in the
[55:02] fact that Paul used
[55:04] a poem,
[55:08] an artifact of their culture, a paradox,
[55:13] and paradoxically affirms it to open up
[55:16] his mind, to ready him, to get him to
[55:19] see the context of where he's standing.
[55:22] And Lord, I share this not that we would
[55:24] become enamored with the ancients and
[55:26] not that we would think that paganism is
[55:28] okay,
[55:30] but certainly Lord, in some ways it
[55:31] would soften our addiction to legalism
[55:36] and maybe give us a heart to those who
[55:38] are blind.
[55:40] Give us a feeling for those who are
[55:42] lost.
[55:44] And I share it within this context,
[55:46] Lord, because as I've been impressed
[55:49] to
[55:51] and burdened, just driven to pour my
[55:53] heart into these things. I see that so
[55:56] much philosophy has grabbed a hold of
[55:57] us.
[55:59] And we did it because we didn't catch
[56:02] we didn't catch what the prophet was
[56:04] doing.
[56:06] That when brother Brandham used these
[56:08] things, it wasn't it wasn't approval.
[56:11] [Music]
[56:13] It wasn't a doorway into them, but he
[56:17] was given a master class on how to reach
[56:19] a entire age.
[56:23] And Lord, I believe this message is
[56:24] true. I believe it's vindicated. And I
[56:26] don't need more bombs to drop to believe
[56:27] that.
[56:30] Lord, in the next election cycle, we
[56:33] could have a woman president, woman vice
[56:35] president,
[56:37] nine female Catholic Supreme Court
[56:39] justices
[56:41] and an entire Senate of all women,
[56:46] entire house of all Catholics, and it
[56:49] wouldn't make me believe this message is
[56:50] true more than I do today.
[56:54] And Lord, I believe then I believe that
[56:56] what you have given us is real. It's
[56:58] true.
[57:00] and that there's been a lot of
[57:01] philosophies. There's been a lot of
[57:02] ideologies. There's been a lot of weeds
[57:05] from off the highway, the ditches trying
[57:08] to pull us to the side.
[57:10] Keep your eyes straight on Calvary. Help
[57:13] me, Lord, to navigate the prophet of
[57:15] this end time and the philosophers that
[57:17] he used.
[57:20] Lord, there's so much out there in the
[57:22] world. and whether it be Mormonism and
[57:25] whether it be uh millennialism and all
[57:28] these different ways and post-trib and
[57:30] preerttrib and so many lordship doctrine
[57:33] and so many philosophies that we could
[57:36] just get so caught up in and not realize
[57:37] that we're we're buying into a man-made
[57:40] theology and we miss the point. Help us
[57:43] to be free from it. Lord, I believe that
[57:46] you're individually wanting to unite,
[57:48] knit yourself together with individual
[57:50] souls, daughters of God, sons of God.
[57:52] And Lord, may we as a collective church
[57:55] support that vision.
[57:58] And so, Lord, I take no pride of
[58:01] ownership.
[58:03] I trust you to deal individually with
[58:04] hearts. And Lord, I know that it's
[58:05] created maybe a little bit different
[58:08] dynamic than I would want personally as
[58:10] far as involvement and commitment and
[58:11] dedication.
[58:13] And there's a lot of things that people
[58:14] get slack on and they're not obedient
[58:16] to.
[58:18] But Lord, I just trust you're leading
[58:20] and you're guiding and you're weaving
[58:22] yourself together with hearts.
[58:25] Bless us today as we worship you. Go
[58:26] with us as we're dismissed. We ask all
[58:28] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:29] Christ. Amen.
