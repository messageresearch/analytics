[0:00] Matthew chapter 24, we'll start with
[0:02] verse 14. And this gospel of the kingdom
[0:05] shall be preached in all the world for a
[0:07] witness unto all nations, and then shall
[0:11] the end come. That's a very precise
[0:14] verbiage there. When ye therefore shall
[0:17] see the abomination of desolation spoken
[0:20] of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the
[0:22] holy place, and then who so readeth, let
[0:25] him understand. And there's some sense
[0:27] of urgency here from Matthew that those
[0:29] that read would understand. Then let
[0:31] them which be in Judea flee into the
[0:33] mountains. Let him which is on the
[0:35] housetop not come down to take anything
[0:37] out of his house. Neither let him which
[0:39] is in the field return back to take his
[0:41] clothes. And woe unto them that are with
[0:44] child and to them that give suck in
[0:46] those days. But pray ye that your flight
[0:48] be not in the winter, neither on the
[0:50] Sabbath day. But then shall be great
[0:52] tribulation, such as was not since the
[0:54] beginning of the world to this time, no,
[0:56] nor ever shall be. Amen. You can be
[1:01] seated. My title today is strong enough
[1:04] to cry. We'll elaborate on this maybe
[1:06] here in just a little bit. We are
[1:08] continuing to look at the subject of
[1:09] being a witness and what that means to
[1:13] be a witness. I know sometimes we we
[1:15] think witnessing is passing out tracks
[1:17] or that to preach the gospel means that
[1:19] we have to take a text and stand behind
[1:21] the pulpit or maybe do some street
[1:23] corner preaching and uh or you know
[1:26] probing people's hearts with very
[1:27] specific questions. But I think there's
[1:29] a a greater way that we can be a witness
[1:31] than even in those things as even this
[1:34] morning me standing here preaching the
[1:36] gospel uh is to a limited audience and
[1:39] that audience is limited to those who
[1:40] are here present and then there's some
[1:42] that may ar uh you know go into the
[1:45] archives or some that are streaming and
[1:47] so that's a very limited audience.
[1:48] Sometimes you can actually count the
[1:50] number of people that have heard your
[1:51] sermon uh when it's to a local
[1:54] congregation, but then there's a
[1:56] witnessing that's done beyond this
[1:57] dynamic that's even more effective and
[1:59] greater uh than what this can be in a
[2:02] single instance. And so that's kind of
[2:03] the some of the things that are on our
[2:04] heart in terms of witnessing. Now in
[2:07] Matthew
[2:09] 24:14 it says, "And this gospel of the
[2:11] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[2:14] world for a witness unto all nations and
[2:17] then shall the end come." So we know
[2:21] that until this scripture has been
[2:23] fulfilled uh and to whatever application
[2:26] it is given, this gospel going to all
[2:29] nations and being witnessed and preached
[2:32] to all nations as a witness has to
[2:34] happen before this finality or this
[2:37] ending or conclusion of a dispensation
[2:39] comes. And this for a witness it means
[2:42] that it's going to be a testimony. The
[2:44] gospel is going to be preached as a
[2:46] testimony unto all nations. There's
[2:48] going to be an example of faith. There's
[2:50] going to be something demonstrated that
[2:52] declares uh the gospel. And to be a
[2:56] witness, uh some of the prior things
[2:57] we've looked at the last few services is
[2:59] you must have a heart for the truth. You
[3:01] must love truth. And that's a heart for
[3:03] God. And then also to be an effective
[3:05] witness, you have to have a heart for
[3:06] people. Otherwise, you can be untruthful
[3:10] with the truth. You can use it to your
[3:11] own advantage. You can use it just to
[3:13] tear other things down, but you have to
[3:15] have a heart of a witness to be a true
[3:17] witness. A witness is one who testifies
[3:19] or one who bears testimony of faith.
[3:22] That Greek word that's used in the
[3:24] scripture is where we get our term
[3:25] martyr from. In other words, they were
[3:27] willing to be an example of faith and to
[3:29] demonstrate their faith even unto death.
[3:32] And in Matthew chapter 24, we see that
[3:35] Jesus is prophesying as soon as he says
[3:38] the gospel must be preached unto all
[3:39] nations as a witness. and then the end
[3:42] shall come. He immediately begins to
[3:44] prophesy the destruction of Jerusalem.
[3:46] He says in verse 15, when you therefore
[3:48] shall see the abomination of desolation
[3:51] spoken of by the Daniel the prophet
[3:53] stand in the holy place and then this
[3:55] emphasis from Matthew, who so readeth,
[3:57] let him understand. So there was
[3:59] something Jesus conveyed that even
[4:01] oppress impressed the writer and realize
[4:03] Jesus is giving a warning. He's given a
[4:05] prophecy saying that when you see this
[4:07] happen, those who are doing this, don't
[4:09] stop. go do this, do that. Those that
[4:11] are out in the field, just go. Those
[4:13] that are with child, you better better
[4:15] listen and heed because it's going to be
[4:16] a terrible time. And so he prophesies of
[4:19] the destruction of Jerusalem. This is no
[4:22] coincidence because he has just said in
[4:24] verse 14 that the gospel's got to be
[4:27] preached unto all nations. So this
[4:28] speaks of a gentile gospel going to the
[4:30] Gentiles and then immediately goes into
[4:33] the ending that finality and that
[4:35] judgment upon Jerusalem as that final
[4:38] act of that Jewish dispensation closing.
[4:41] And as we were reading on Wednesday
[4:43] night in Ezekiel chapter 9, it fulfills
[4:46] and we'll read some of those verses here
[4:48] in a moment. That's prophecy that is
[4:50] fulfilled in 70 AD when Titus besieges
[4:53] Jerusalem and there's a great slaughter.
[4:55] There's over a million that are dead.
[4:57] there's cannibalism. Uh it's a very
[4:59] terrible and dreadful time. And brother
[5:02] Brandham shows us that and he teaches
[5:03] this consistently that was the end or
[5:05] that finality of the Jewish
[5:07] dispensation. And it was at that time
[5:09] when the Christian church is coming
[5:10] forth. It's entering a new age. And he
[5:13] said that this is repeating again now in
[5:16] the time that we're living in. And so
[5:17] the ending of that age or that time
[5:19] holds a type of the ending of the
[5:22] gentile dispensation or the end that
[5:24] Jesus is referring to in Matthew
[5:28] 24:14. In Luke chapter 19 verses 41 to
[5:32] 44. You'll find a very similar u
[5:35] expression to what he's saying in
[5:36] Matthew
[5:39] 24. And it says when he was come near he
[5:41] beheld the city and wept over it. I
[5:44] wanted you to get this thought of him
[5:46] weeping. This is part of where I'm
[5:48] getting my inspiration for strong enough
[5:50] to cry. Jesus beheld Jerusalem and be to
[5:53] weep over. He mourned. He lamented. It's
[5:55] this sigh of pain for uh what they've
[5:58] done. As he begins to say in verse 42,
[6:01] "If thou hast known even thou at least
[6:04] in this thy day the things which belong
[6:07] unto thy peace, but now they are hid
[6:09] from thine eyes. For the day shall come
[6:11] upon thee that thine enemy shall cast a
[6:13] trench about thee and compass thee
[6:15] around and keep thee in on every side.
[6:17] This is very specific about even what
[6:21] happens in 70 AD at this Roman siege.
[6:24] And shall thy shall and shall lay thee
[6:27] upon even with the ground lay thee even
[6:29] with the ground and thy children within
[6:31] thee. They shall not leave in thee one
[6:34] stone upon another because thou kneest
[6:36] not the time of thy visitation. Who is
[6:39] it that's going to be destroyed? Those
[6:41] that didn't know the time of their
[6:43] visitation. Because the believers who
[6:45] had heard this and as Matthew said, "Who
[6:47] so readeth, let him understand, those
[6:49] who heard and read and understood were
[6:51] not caught in Jerusalem, but escaped the
[6:53] judgment that was coming because they
[6:56] believed Christ and believed his word."
[6:58] And so Jesus is weeping over Jerusalem
[7:02] and he's lamenting and he's crying. A
[7:04] and it's this expression of grief for
[7:07] what they had done. And as Christ weeps
[7:10] over Jerusalem, he gives verbal
[7:12] expression or we can say formal
[7:14] expression to this inner grief or pain.
[7:16] And he begins to speak, oh, you've
[7:18] rejected the word that's come to you.
[7:20] And because you've rejected the word
[7:22] that's come to you and you haven't
[7:23] received the word in your time of
[7:25] visitation, that's judgment that remains
[7:28] for you. And he begins to pour this out
[7:30] and he cries over
[7:33] Jerusalem. This is where I get my title.
[7:35] I want to use this to support my title.
[7:37] Strong enough to cry. I don't know that
[7:40] any one of us would want to argue that
[7:41] Jesus was weak. Uh in a in a sense that
[7:45] he was just trifling and he was piddly
[7:48] and he was a pushover, but he was strong
[7:50] enough to cry. It says in John 11:35
[7:53] about Lazarus that Jesus wept. I know
[7:55] that's many of you young people's
[7:56] favorite scripture, so you have it
[7:57] memorized. It's the shortest one that I
[7:59] know of. Jesus wept. In other words, it
[8:01] says he shed tears. It was a He was a
[8:05] man that could cry. He could weep. He
[8:07] wasn't afraid to, but he was confident
[8:10] enough in who he was, and he didn't mind
[8:12] maybe the sense of being vulnerable. He
[8:14] was strong enough to cry. Now, in
[8:17] Ezekiel 9:4, this is very specific. Now,
[8:21] if you want to take time to go back and
[8:23] read more in Ezekiel 9, it's that
[8:24] prophecy that we can see connected to
[8:27] Matthew 24, connected to Luke 19, it's
[8:30] that prophecy when there's going to be
[8:32] destruction on Jerusalem
[8:34] specifically. And before the slain comes
[8:38] and before those slaughtering angels
[8:39] with their slaughtering weapons in their
[8:41] hand go forth to slay, and the Bible
[8:44] says, "And they do slay them." God says
[8:46] to the angel who had the well of ink and
[8:50] that that writing utensil and that ink
[8:52] corn by his side to go into the city and
[8:54] this is what it says. Go through the
[8:56] midst of the city and through the midst
[8:57] of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[9:00] foreheads of the men that sigh and that
[9:03] cry for all the abominations that be
[9:06] done in the midst thereof. Set a mark
[9:08] upon the foreheads of the men that sigh
[9:12] and cry. I know there's a lot today um
[9:15] and I think it's kind of this in that
[9:17] new age revival or however they call it
[9:19] noir uh that's exists within the
[9:22] Christian community and nominal
[9:23] Christianity. There's kind of this new
[9:24] invention of what a what a real man is
[9:27] and a lot of it is just this uh uh it's
[9:30] really really shallow and they'll even
[9:32] decide whether or not you're a man based
[9:33] upon whether or not you're standing
[9:34] upright in your pictures with your wife
[9:36] and if you're leaning you're the simp
[9:38] and if she's standing upright she's the
[9:40] one that controls the scene. And so
[9:41] there's a lot of psychology they put
[9:43] into it and they don't have a clue what
[9:45] real manhood is. And there's a lot of
[9:47] women that want to be in subjection to
[9:50] their husbands and they're saying that I
[9:51] love being under subjection. And there's
[9:54] nothing reflecting a godly Christianity.
[9:57] It's just that they have uh uh they're
[9:59] happy being told what to do and they're
[10:02] subject not to a godly man, but they
[10:04] just want to create the appearance of
[10:06] being a biblical marriage. So there's a
[10:08] lot of nonsense that's out there today
[10:10] in terms of what it means to be a man
[10:11] and what it means to be a woman. But
[10:14] here the Bible actually is telling us
[10:16] that there's to be a mark placed on the
[10:18] foreheads of men that sigh and cry. That
[10:21] mark is that set a mark to it's a it
[10:24] means to mark a mark. That letter we
[10:27] mentioned on Wednesday night that letter
[10:28] or that mark uh is believed to be that T
[10:31] or that towel which would be the sign of
[10:33] a cross even on the forehead. Mark a
[10:35] mark or sign a sign on the foreheads.
[10:38] It's a divine mark. It's prominence.
[10:39] It's on the forehead. It's something at
[10:41] the forefront that distinguished them so
[10:44] that they would not be killed or
[10:46] slaughtered at the time of the
[10:48] slaughter. So it it marked them for
[10:50] deliverance. And the mark is placed on
[10:53] ones who have a very specific character.
[10:55] The Bible says upon them that sigh and
[10:57] cry. They had a very specific character.
[10:59] And I like to say it this way. They had
[11:01] the a heart like
[11:03] God's. They had they had something in
[11:05] their heart that God was pleased with.
[11:08] It was men sighing and crying for the
[11:10] abominations done in Jerusalem just as
[11:12] Christ was sighing and crying in Luke
[11:15] 19. Christ just does not prophesy of the
[11:18] destruction of Jerusalem. In Matthew 24,
[11:21] he's saying destruction's coming, but
[11:23] listen, take heed so that you can't
[11:25] escape. There's one who didn't wasn't
[11:27] just happy to see destruction coming,
[11:30] but rather he was wanting to provide a
[11:32] way of escape. In Luke 19, he's not
[11:34] gleefully looking out over uh Jerusalem
[11:36] saying, "Oh, they're going to get what's
[11:38] coming to them." Which sometimes is our
[11:39] attitude towards Leodysa and people who
[11:41] offend us like, "Oh, they have no idea
[11:43] what's coming to them. Do you know who I
[11:44] am? Do you know what you've just done?
[11:46] You've just offended the bride of Jesus
[11:47] Christ." And we're kind of all excited
[11:49] about the judgment to come. This is not
[11:52] the attitude that Jesus has. But just as
[11:54] Christ wept over Jerusalem here in
[11:57] Ezekiel, there are men and women. and
[11:59] we'll say women, but there's men that
[12:01] are noted here in this collective of
[12:02] believers that were weeping over
[12:05] Jerusalem just like Christ did hundreds
[12:07] of years later.
[12:10] So let's think about these words sigh in
[12:13] Christ. Sigh is this to groan in in
[12:16] grief. It's it's like a gasp so to
[12:19] speak. It's this inner grief for sins
[12:22] and sorrows in this particular
[12:23] scripture. of the sins of the people,
[12:25] the the uh their bondage and their
[12:28] wickedness. It causes this inner grief.
[12:30] You you sense this grieving. In Romans
[12:33] chapter 8 20 verse 26, it says,
[12:36] "Likewise, the spirit also helpeth our
[12:38] infirmities, for we know not what we
[12:40] should pray for as we ought, but the
[12:43] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[12:46] with groanings which cannot be uttered."
[12:48] Using this scripture just to kind of
[12:50] show what this means. Men who sigh. I
[12:52] know when you say, "Oh, he breathed the
[12:53] sigh of relief like and we can kind of
[12:56] hear that." But this sighing is inward
[12:58] where one could be a sigh and it's not
[13:00] necessarily something that you can give
[13:02] that as verbal but it's this something
[13:05] inside this groaning inside. Second
[13:08] Peter 2 7 and 8 speak of it this way and
[13:11] delivered just Lot vexed with the filthy
[13:15] conversations of the wicked. Those the
[13:17] sinful lives of those in Sodom were
[13:19] causing lot to be vexed in his soul. For
[13:23] the righteous man dwelleth among them in
[13:25] seed and hearing vexed his righteous
[13:27] soul from day to day with their unlawful
[13:29] deeds. That vexing means they he was
[13:31] oppressed or burdened. It weighed him
[13:34] down inwardly. So Lot may have not been
[13:37] much uh verbal rebuke or some ver verbal
[13:40] scathing or correction but it vexed his
[13:43] heart to see the sins of Sodom. That's
[13:47] that inward groaning that weight that
[13:49] presses down upon you. But it's not just
[13:53] those who inwardly sigh, but it says
[13:55] sigh and cry. And I want my emphasis to
[13:57] be on this crying part. To cry means to
[14:00] lament or make lamentation. You say,
[14:03] "Well, please define
[14:04] lamentation." Well, it means to
[14:07] lament. But to cry, it is uh it is a
[14:11] shouting. It's the it's it's something
[14:13] that is verbal. To cry, to lament, to
[14:16] whail, to to give expression to and it's
[14:19] used of those of witnessing against
[14:23] wickedness. It's this outward expression
[14:25] of that inner grief. Now there may be a
[14:27] time when you inwardly are grieved or
[14:29] burdened uh and so you're sighing but
[14:31] crying is joined to this because there's
[14:33] something that is outward. Jesus Christ
[14:36] just wasn't uh weeping in his heart but
[14:38] he he expressed it. He spoke as he wept.
[14:42] He didn't just say all judgment's coming
[14:44] and leave it at that. He he provided a
[14:46] way of escape. There was a cry that
[14:48] joined with it. So we can sigh and groan
[14:51] privately. Th those are the affections
[14:53] of mind and heart. But then we're to
[14:56] also cry which is to be mourned or
[14:59] shouted
[15:01] publicly. Uh stay with me. I don't want
[15:03] to end
[15:05] there. But this cry is manifested by
[15:08] bearing testimony against the sins that
[15:10] are committed.
[15:13] After weeping over Jerusalem, Jesus says
[15:16] in Luke chapter 19 45 and 47, you notice
[15:19] this very next verse. And he went into
[15:21] the temple, he began to cast out them
[15:23] that sold therein and them that bought.
[15:25] So not only does he weep over Jerusalem,
[15:28] but now as he comes in, he begins to
[15:30] cast them out that sold and that bought,
[15:32] saying unto them, it is written, "My
[15:33] house is the house of prayer, but you
[15:35] have made it a den of thieves." Yes. And
[15:38] he taught daily in the temple. So he's
[15:40] still there teaching daily. He does this
[15:42] uh purging. It's called the second
[15:44] cleansing of the temple. He does this
[15:45] purging. We'll come back to John 2 here
[15:47] in a little bit. He taught daily in the
[15:49] temple, but the chief priests and
[15:50] scribes and the chief of the people
[15:51] sought to destroy him. But it says they
[15:53] couldn't because the people were
[15:55] astonished at his doctrine. They were
[15:57] drawn to his
[15:58] teaching. Christ not only wept over
[16:01] Jerusalem, but he comes down within
[16:03] Jerusalem and he begins to cry out
[16:04] against the sins that are being
[16:06] committed in Jerusalem. So, a cry is,
[16:10] and stay very close to how I'm wanting
[16:12] to express this. I hope that there's
[16:14] been some momentum through these prior
[16:15] services. A cry is a protest of sin.
[16:18] Amen. And I believe that we have a duty
[16:21] to live as an open protest to wicked
[16:24] wickedness. That's right. Not not so
[16:27] much what we're saying and the signs
[16:29] that we're painting and the businesses
[16:31] that we target. That shouldn't that's
[16:33] not a part of it all. Our lives ought to
[16:35] be at the very least a subtle
[16:39] protest and a demon yet demonstrative
[16:42] protest against the evil that exists in
[16:44] the day that we're living in. We do not
[16:46] live in Leodysia gleefully that they're
[16:48] all going to burn and be destroyed. But
[16:50] we live in such a way to want my life to
[16:52] in some way be a light that others who
[16:55] are groping in this darkness could see
[16:57] something in me that would cause them to
[16:58] say, "How is it you keep your head when
[17:01] everyone else is losing theirs? Why is
[17:03] it that you can live peaceibly with so
[17:05] many people with so many different ideas
[17:07] and you could testify of an anchor and
[17:09] an absolute which is more sure than
[17:11] anything that exists in the world today.
[17:14] Amen.
[17:16] We must be I'm using this phrase strong
[17:18] enough to
[17:19] cry. But if we're going to be strong
[17:21] enough to cry truly in the way that I
[17:23] mean it here and we don't just leave
[17:24] with this motivation to go and find the
[17:26] first church that we don't think is uh
[17:28] presenting the gospel right and kick
[17:30] over their tables and cause a
[17:31] disruption. We must first remember our
[17:33] own sins and our own sinful condition.
[17:37] In Galatians 6:1, it says, "Brethren, if
[17:39] a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which
[17:42] are spiritual, restore such a one in the
[17:45] spirit of meekness, considering thyself,
[17:48] lest thou also be tempted." We must
[17:51] first if we're going to sorrow, if we
[17:53] sigh for the sins of others and we're
[17:55] going to cry for the sins of others, we
[17:57] must first remember the sorrow we had
[17:59] for our own sins and remember that it
[18:02] was godly sorrow that led us to
[18:03] repentance. That it was the gospel that
[18:05] awakened us to our depravity and our
[18:07] shortcomings. And so we must first
[18:09] remember our own sorrows for our own
[18:11] sins when we see the sins of others.
[18:13] Amen. If not, we risk just seeing
[18:16] everyone else's bad conduct and bad
[18:18] character. And then we develop an
[18:19] attitude towards them. We become bitter
[18:21] towards them. We become judgmental
[18:22] because we've somehow forgotten that we
[18:24] ourselves were once just like them.
[18:27] And so it require the spirit of meekness
[18:29] is required because it requires some
[18:31] balance of tenderness and zeal. You do
[18:34] need to be zealous for truth, but you
[18:36] want to be truthful as brother said
[18:37] about the truth and with the truth so
[18:40] that it can be effective. Don't want to
[18:42] use it as an instrument to drive people
[18:44] away, but you'd want to use it as a
[18:46] means of driving spirits away and evil
[18:48] away and catching the heart of the one
[18:50] who's in bondage to it. Amen. James 1:es
[18:55] 22, 23, and 24 says, "But be doers of
[18:58] the word and not hearers
[19:00] only, deceiving your own selves. For if
[19:03] any be a hearer of the word and not a
[19:05] doer, he's likened to a man beholding
[19:08] his natural face in a glass. He sees
[19:10] himself for what he is, but for he
[19:12] beholdeth himself and goeth his way, and
[19:15] straightway forggetth what manner of man
[19:18] he was. As believers, we first mourn our
[19:21] own sins. I would go so far as to say
[19:23] this that if we are going to sigh and
[19:26] cry for the sins of others, we should be
[19:28] repenting for our own sins if we've
[19:30] committed them. Should be uh seeking
[19:33] forgiveness for our own trespasses.
[19:35] Amen. But Christians though that they
[19:37] would though they sigh and cry for the
[19:39] sins done by others, we don't forget who
[19:41] we were. Right? Before we grieve what
[19:43] others are
[19:46] to mourn the sins of others and to begin
[19:49] to lament and cry out against the sins
[19:50] of others before first repenting. Think
[19:53] of how hypocritical this is. If you have
[19:56] your own sins, you have your own
[19:57] shortcomings, you're living in sin.
[19:58] Let's say you've never never come to the
[20:00] cross, but you're religious and you
[20:01] begin to castigate everyone else. That
[20:03] is pure hypocrisy.
[20:06] It's really is corrupt character to
[20:08] publicly protest sin but live in sin.
[20:11] And that's what strikes me a lot of
[20:12] times with these modern-day Christian
[20:14] inventions of protesting certain
[20:16] policies and certain ways of life and
[20:17] lifestyles. There's no holiness of
[20:19] virtue in the ones that are protesting.
[20:22] It's the worst character to go out and
[20:23] and spit in people's faces and tear them
[20:26] down and call them sinners and all sorts
[20:28] of things. But yourself live in sin or
[20:30] never repent or grieve over your own
[20:32] sin. That's right. Living in all sorts
[20:34] of idolatry and fornication and adultery
[20:37] and uh uh abuses, but then just singling
[20:39] out one sin that you want to oppose and
[20:42] that's hypocrisy. It's the corrupt
[20:44] character.
[20:46] So if we if we sigh and we cry, it's
[20:48] with a
[20:50] remembrance. We sigh and cry because of
[20:52] even our own weaknesses and
[20:53] disobedience. We know how much it can
[20:56] cause affliction. We know how much in
[20:57] bondage we can be. We know how blinded
[20:59] we can be, how religious we can be, and
[21:03] it informs this sighing and crying. So,
[21:06] we're strong enough to cry because we
[21:08] remember our own weaknesses.
[21:10] And we also are strong enough to cry
[21:12] because we're zealous for the glory of
[21:14] God. This is not self- serving. This is
[21:16] not a a zeal that we have so that we can
[21:19] look good and look better than everyone
[21:21] else. Right. Sometimes people hunt an
[21:24] ideology that uh they can fit into to
[21:27] make them superior than everybody else.
[21:30] Like me saying, "I really I I subscribe
[21:32] to the theory that 50-year-olds named
[21:34] Aaron are the best best there is in the
[21:36] world." Right? And you just you just
[21:38] find that paradigm that makes you look
[21:40] better than everyone else. And that's
[21:42] what a lot of things in give provide
[21:44] people is a sense of belonging so that
[21:47] they can feel superior or better than
[21:49] other people. And so it's not it's not
[21:52] to lift or elevate uh one person over
[21:56] the other, but it's zealous for God and
[21:58] his glory and what's due to him. In John
[22:02] 2:es 13-17, this is the first instance
[22:05] where we find Christ entering into the
[22:06] temple and the Jews Passover was at hand
[22:09] and or entering into the temple to purge
[22:11] it or cleanse it. Jesus went up to
[22:13] Jerusalem and found in the temple those
[22:15] who sold oxen and sheep and doves and
[22:17] the chambers of money sitting changers
[22:19] of money sitting. And when he had made a
[22:21] scourge of small cords, he drove them
[22:23] all out of the temple and the sheep and
[22:24] the auction and poured out the changers
[22:26] money and overthrew the
[22:27] tables and said unto them that sold
[22:30] doves, I don't know why he singles them
[22:31] out. You in particular, you dove
[22:34] sellers, take these things hence, make
[22:37] not my father's house a house of
[22:39] merchandise.
[22:40] This is this is quite an instance. But
[22:43] then they remember the prophecy in
[22:44] Psalms says, "And his disciples remember
[22:46] that it's written, the zeal of thine
[22:47] house hath eaten me up." Right? So it
[22:51] wasn't Jesus wasn't zealous because he
[22:53] wasn't making money. And Jesus wasn't
[22:55] zealous because uh his team wasn't
[22:58] scoring more points. He was zealous for
[23:00] the Lord's house. And being zealous for
[23:03] the Lord's house, it was he he he
[23:06] protested the sin. He protested what it
[23:08] had become because of his zeal for God.
[23:11] Wasn't wasn't even that they needed to
[23:13] know who he was necessarily. This is my
[23:16] house and look what you've done. But
[23:17] it's the zeal for the father's house. It
[23:19] was a zeal for God that motivated him.
[23:22] Amen.
[23:24] So it's a we have to have that love in
[23:26] our heart for truth. We love the Lord
[23:28] thy God with all thy heart. That's where
[23:30] this genesis of this behavior is. And
[23:33] then loving God, we would hate sin.
[23:36] those things that are contrary to God.
[23:38] And I like to say it is godlike to
[23:40] grieve
[23:42] sin. Genesis chapter 6:es 5 and 6. And
[23:45] God saw that the wicked of man was great
[23:47] in the earth. These are in the days of
[23:48] Noah. And that every imagination of the
[23:51] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[23:53] continually. And it repented the Lord
[23:55] that he had made man on the earth. And
[23:57] it grieved him at his heart. You see
[24:01] where it's godlike for sin to grieve
[24:03] you? Amen. This is something I I'll just
[24:06] say personally, this is something that's
[24:07] becoming very real to me because I I I
[24:10] remember years ago I ministered here on
[24:14] being numb. And there was a time in my
[24:15] life where I didn't know if it was this
[24:17] is what faith was or if I was just numb
[24:18] because I wasn't affected by anything.
[24:20] Am I just so strong now where nothing
[24:22] bothers me or if I just become so numb
[24:24] and callous to feeling that I don't feel
[24:27] anything? And if we're not careful, we
[24:29] can lose our blush for worldly things
[24:32] and we lose our sensitivity to
[24:34] wickedness and evil. A and me myself
[24:36] very guilty of that. So I'm not pointing
[24:38] fingers at anyone. And it's becoming
[24:40] more real to me that wow, it's very
[24:42] godlike to be grieved by sin. Very
[24:45] godlike to be grieved by wrong
[24:47] atmospheres. It's very godlike to be
[24:48] grieved by things that he is not pleased
[24:51] with. That's right.
[24:53] And so this response, this sighing and
[24:56] crying in Jerusalem, it was with the
[24:59] remembrance that we ourselves would be
[25:01] were sinners too. Those that were
[25:03] signing and crying in Jerusalem
[25:05] recognized their own failures and
[25:06] faults. They weren't just pointing
[25:07] fingers. They themselves had repented.
[25:09] They were lamenting their own sins. And
[25:11] in signing and crying for the
[25:12] abominations that were being conducted
[25:14] in that city, it was it was a part of
[25:16] the heart of God and their zeal for God.
[25:22] And we sigh and cry not only to the love
[25:24] of the Lord th our God with all of our
[25:26] hearts, but we sigh and cry out of
[25:28] concern for our neighbor.
[25:31] We're not indifferent. We're not just
[25:32] kind of cold and could care less. We're
[25:34] not
[25:35] unconcerned. We're convinced of truth.
[25:37] And being convinced of truth, we're
[25:38] concerned.
[25:40] Romans chapter 13:8, it says, "Owe no
[25:43] man anything but to love one another."
[25:46] This is a duty. owe no man anything but
[25:49] to love one another. For he that loveth
[25:51] another hath fulfilled the law. We have
[25:54] a duty to love. We have a duty uh to
[25:57] love because it's in loving that we
[25:59] fulfill the law. Many scriptures we've
[26:01] used often here and then even recently
[26:04] on how that loving your neighbor
[26:06] fulfills the law. Owe no man anything
[26:09] but to love one another. And this love
[26:12] is not it's not human. It's not based
[26:14] upon mushy gushy and emotions. how it's
[26:17] very tied to the word of God. In the
[26:20] sermon, Thirsting for Life, Brother
[26:22] Benham said, "That's what we need
[26:23] tonight, an
[26:26] interest." I I thought this was
[26:28] profound. I found it in more than one
[26:29] place, so I'll read it in just a few
[26:30] places. He says, "We need an interest."
[26:32] You know, the Holy Ghost only marked
[26:34] those who sighed and cried for the
[26:35] abominations did in the city. That's
[26:37] what the Bible said. What if he came to
[26:39] Dallas tonight? Can you go lay your hand
[26:42] on any Pentecostal, Baptist,
[26:44] Presbyterian, Luther that cries and
[26:46] prays and fasts day and night for the
[26:48] sins that's dead in Dallas? Think in
[26:50] your mind now. Is that your house or is
[26:53] it your neighbor's house? Where is that
[26:55] fellow? He says, "Leave it with you. I'm
[26:59] going to leave it with you. Where is he?
[27:02] Think of it now. Will you raise your
[27:04] hand saying God given me such a hunger
[27:06] for souls that I can't rest? I'll have
[27:09] to do something about it. God, let me
[27:11] thirst for you. In thirsting for life,
[27:15] it causes this burden for those who
[27:17] don't have life. In longing for more of
[27:19] God, it causes a burden for those who
[27:21] don't don't want more for God. The more
[27:24] that we become into this revelation of
[27:26] Jesus Christ, the more concerned we
[27:27] should be for those who've rejected
[27:29] Christ and kicked him out of the church,
[27:31] the more zealous we become for the
[27:33] things of God, the more burden we should
[27:34] be for those who are just lukewarm and
[27:36] indifferent about God.
[27:38] Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham says uh in
[27:41] an question and answers part three, he
[27:43] says the sigh and cry for the
[27:44] abomination that's done in the city.
[27:46] Where do you see
[27:47] that? Now listen, I can show you 10,000
[27:51] speaking in tongues to one that's really
[27:53] burdened for sin.
[27:57] 10,000 speaking in tongues to ones
[27:59] that's really burdened for sin. They
[28:01] can't even pray an hour. But did you
[28:02] know the Bible said to mark only those
[28:04] who sigh and cry for the abominations in
[28:06] the city? Where are the people that are
[28:10] interested? I can show you people that
[28:13] jump up and down and cry in church. I
[28:15] can show you people that shout and run
[28:16] all over the building. I can show you
[28:19] people that prophesy and it comes to
[28:20] pass. I can show you those who speak in
[28:23] tongues and run up and down the
[28:24] buildings and say things that actually
[28:26] interpret and it comes to pass. But
[28:28] where is that person that sigh and cries
[28:30] for the abominations this done in the
[28:32] city? Where's that burdened soul? He
[28:35] says you could turn some new leaves on
[28:37] that.
[28:38] That that's what will really turn the
[28:41] page. That's what'll cause some change.
[28:42] That's I said maybe that's a new a real
[28:44] New Year's resolution. Not don't want
[28:46] more shouting. We read it Wednesday
[28:48] night even. He says that about laying
[28:50] hands on the sick and doing these
[28:51] things. It's like oh that's it. He says
[28:52] no that's not
[28:56] it. Where's the burdened
[28:59] soul? Where are those that are
[29:01] interested in sinners?
[29:03] Notice a lot of the speaking in tongues
[29:04] and shouting and dancing and prophesying
[29:06] and all those things. It's all that
[29:08] outward. That doesn't necessarily give
[29:10] us any confirmation of what's inward.
[29:16] The love for our neighbor is
[29:20] expressed in in this sense that we're
[29:23] it's again loving your neighbor is not
[29:26] just being loving or being nice or
[29:29] letting them have their way, but it's
[29:31] based upon this sorrowful
[29:33] reflection of what sin is and that God
[29:36] will judge
[29:37] sin. We don't love our neighbors because
[29:40] we just blind ourselves to God's
[29:41] requirements. We're not worried about
[29:42] what the word of God says and it's just
[29:44] like love everybody, get along with
[29:45] everybody. But we actually love our
[29:47] neighbors because we are conscious and
[29:49] aware of what the damage and destruction
[29:52] sin causes and that them being in sin.
[29:55] We have a heart for them knowing that
[29:56] God's going to judge that sin. In John
[30:00] 13 34-35 he says, "A new commandment I
[30:03] give unto you that you love one another
[30:06] as I have loved you that you love also
[30:08] one another. And by this shall all men
[30:11] know that ye are my disciples if you
[30:14] love one another.
[30:17] So this is a
[30:19] mark of his disciples is that they love
[30:22] one another. Again, not trying to put
[30:24] the wrong kind of interpretation to what
[30:26] love is here, but the love that you have
[30:29] for one
[30:30] another. And in
[30:32] this one of the things I just began to
[30:35] think about more and more as I tried to
[30:36] enter into the thought that Jesus is
[30:38] mean here, my commandment, this new
[30:40] commandment is that you love one
[30:41] another.
[30:42] And if I could say it this way before I
[30:45] get into some of the examples, providing
[30:47] a godly example is a loving act
[30:51] that that Jesus because he loved them
[30:55] sanctified himself.
[30:57] Because Jesus loved he demonstrated
[30:59] because he loved he provided an example.
[31:01] He loved us first and thereby provided
[31:04] an example for us that we should follow
[31:06] in his steps. And so to provide a godly
[31:09] example is an act of love. Right.
[31:11] Sometimes we just say, and this has been
[31:12] one of the challenges in our own homes,
[31:14] let me just pull back the curtain on the
[31:15] Mira household for a moment, that it's
[31:18] been one of those challenges where this
[31:19] is the iPad the song leaders use. It's
[31:21] like, "Hey, buddy, get off your
[31:24] iPad." Seriously, son, stop
[31:29] scrolling. Are you guys still
[31:32] scrolling? Right. There's a little bit
[31:34] of uh there could be some just apparent
[31:36] hypocrisy on its face when we try to
[31:38] drill into our young people things that
[31:40] they ought to do and we're not affording
[31:43] them the example. Say, "Oh, well, I'm
[31:45] doing some top level security stuff over
[31:47] here, son." Like, this is this is
[31:48] loitering. And that's not necessarily
[31:50] what's being conveyed when you're on a
[31:52] on a device at all hours. So, there is
[31:54] something to be said about love
[31:56] constrains us. And when we provoke one
[31:58] another under love and good works that
[32:00] we want to demonstrate by example,
[32:04] James chapter 1 26-27. I really thought
[32:07] I'd get more amens for my kids there.
[32:09] Remind me next time not to pander to
[32:11] them. If any man among you seem to be
[32:13] religious, James 1:es 26- 27. If any man
[32:17] among you seem to be religious and
[32:19] bridleth not his tongue, but dis but
[32:21] deceiveth his own heart, this man's
[32:23] religion is
[32:25] vain. Vain religion. Empty. You're not
[32:29] losing your religion. It's vain. There
[32:30] was never any religion to it. But pure
[32:33] religion and undefiled before God and
[32:34] the father is this. So there's vain
[32:36] religion and pure religion to visit the
[32:38] fatherless and the widows and their
[32:40] affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[32:43] from the world. Right? So many endeavor
[32:46] to do the first part. Well, we're going
[32:48] to be very charitable and we're going to
[32:50] visit the farthest and the widows. We're
[32:51] going to take care of the homeless.
[32:52] We're going to do this philanthropy and
[32:53] we're going to do this. We're going to
[32:54] do this. But to keep himself unspotted
[32:56] from the world is probably the
[32:59] foundation and the bedrock for anything
[33:01] you would do. subsequently
[33:03] that in keeping ourselves unspotted from
[33:05] the world, we demonstrate the right
[33:07] example to the follst. In keeping
[33:09] ourselves unspotted from the world,
[33:10] those that we visit and the widows and
[33:12] and the care that we give is at least
[33:14] showing them from whence it comes in the
[33:16] right and proper way to keep ourselves
[33:20] unspotted from the world causes us to be
[33:22] that testimony and witness.
[33:25] This is why the Bible in encourages us
[33:28] and tells us to keep ourselves unspotted
[33:30] from the world so that we can be a
[33:34] witness. I I I wanted to share this and
[33:36] I'm not I don't think I'm shoehorning
[33:38] this in there or forcing it, but I was
[33:39] reading one of the letters that Van Gogh
[33:40] had written to his brother Theo and and
[33:43] Theo I think was just kind of getting
[33:44] into a particular crowd and he was
[33:46] really enjoying the scene that he was a
[33:47] part of. And Van Go writes to Vincent
[33:50] writes to him and he says this. He says,
[33:52] "If you value the love and esteem of
[33:54] young people," he's kind of running
[33:55] around with that young crowd. He says,
[33:56] "Declare your beliefs openly whenever
[33:58] suitable and admit that you love Christ
[34:01] in the Bible." Isn't that good? He says,
[34:04] "Doesn't a son love his father better
[34:06] for this reason than any
[34:08] other?" When you are if you if you have
[34:11] a love for somebody else, if you value
[34:13] uh uh their esteem and their opinion, if
[34:16] you if you like them, think about this
[34:17] in all other areas of our lives. if I
[34:19] really got in good with this group and
[34:21] I've been accepted into this circle and
[34:22] I find that my status is really good
[34:24] here. Whatever it might be in whatever
[34:27] circle, social or professional it is, it
[34:29] says if you really value it, declare
[34:31] your beliefs openly whenever suitable.
[34:33] I'm glad that that's there because it
[34:36] does give us some wisdom to desire the
[34:38] right moment. He says, "But admit that
[34:40] you love Christ."
[34:42] Now, don't be afraid to be identified
[34:44] with the word of God. In Titus 2 11 and
[34:49] 12, for the grace of God that bringeth
[34:50] salvation, hath appeared to all men,
[34:53] teaching us, remember grace teaches us
[34:56] to deny ungodliness, to deny worldly
[34:58] lust, teaching us that we should live
[35:00] soberly, righteously, and
[35:02] godly in this present
[35:05] world. And if I I want to add this for
[35:08] this present
[35:10] world. The reason why that we would deny
[35:13] ungodliness and worldly lust and live
[35:14] soberly, righteously, and godly is so
[35:16] that we could continue to be in maintain
[35:18] a testimony or protest against it for
[35:21] those who are in bondage to it. We live
[35:24] godly in this present world for the
[35:26] redemption of those who are bound by
[35:28] this present world.
[35:31] Brother Brandham in the sermon, the seal
[35:32] of Christ is speaking of how there's
[35:34] just something been lost in the hearts
[35:36] of the people. No more burden for the
[35:38] lost. Just let them go anyway. And then
[35:40] this as long as we can procelite a
[35:43] little bit and help our cause out, fix
[35:47] our denomination up so they could be the
[35:49] biggest and get more people into that
[35:50] church, then we're just sat we're
[35:52] satisfied. Notice the selfish nature of
[35:56] evangelism or witnessing is that they
[35:58] can just h have their cause be helped a
[36:01] little bit. Fix your numbers up some,
[36:04] but it's not a genuine burden for the
[36:06] lost. You either just kind of let them
[36:07] go or you figure out a way to hook them
[36:08] in and make them stay to suit
[36:11] yourself. In the sermon, the evidence of
[36:13] the resurrection, he says, we make so
[36:15] much emotion over our religious ideas.
[36:18] Think is how fervent and aspirational
[36:21] and uh uh emotional and demonstrative
[36:24] people can get over religious ideas. But
[36:25] who is it in the city tonight in
[36:27] Jeffersonville that's so concerned about
[36:29] the lost world in this last day that
[36:31] even spends 30 minutes a night praying
[36:33] for the sins of the city? We are not
[36:35] interested
[36:37] anymore. We just want to know that we
[36:39] can have a good time. We just want to
[36:41] know that we can have a little society
[36:43] in our church. There's the social
[36:44] aspect. people choosing their place of
[36:47] worship for social reasons. We want to
[36:50] know that we've got a vote coming in
[36:51] when it comes to time to elect the next
[36:54] pastor. Ah, doing some discerning today,
[36:57] isn't it? We want our church to look a
[37:00] little better than the next fellow's
[37:02] church. That's the idea of the world
[37:06] today. This is not that's not the right
[37:08] kind of heart.
[37:10] It's not the right kind of motivation,
[37:12] but it's out of if you have a heart that
[37:14] remembers your own sin, that loves God,
[37:17] then you're concerned, genuinely
[37:18] concerned for your neighbor.
[37:21] When you remember your own sin and love
[37:23] God, it develops this genuine concern.
[37:26] Say, "They don't have to go to my
[37:29] church. I they just need to come to know
[37:32] Christ the way that I know him because
[37:33] there's judgment for them if they don't.
[37:39] if you could. I think this I just have a
[37:42] uh maybe a couple more scriptures to
[37:44] read here, but just one little bit
[37:46] length more lengthy one in Romans
[37:47] chapter 15 verses 1-7. Yep, this is this
[37:50] is where we're we're at here towards the
[37:53] end. Romans chapter 15:es 1-7. I'll read
[37:56] verse one, then we'll pick up here in a
[37:58] little bit. Um well, actually, we'll
[38:00] just go to verses 2 and three. How was
[38:01] that? says, "When then we then we then
[38:06] that are strong
[38:09] ought to bear the infirmities of the
[38:11] weak."
[38:15] We know in Galatians it says, "Every man
[38:16] must bear his own burden." But then he
[38:19] says, "Bear you one another's burdens."
[38:20] Two different kinds of burdens. We then
[38:23] that are strong ought to bear the
[38:25] infirmities of the weak and not to
[38:28] please ourselves.
[38:30] You find over and over and over again
[38:32] where brother Benham uses Ezekiel 9:4 as
[38:34] a true test of Christian character. Do
[38:37] we sigh and cry for the sins conducted
[38:40] by the people? Do we sigh and cry for
[38:42] sinners? Are we burdened for lost souls?
[38:45] We then that are strong ought to bear
[38:47] the infirmities of the weak and not to
[38:49] please
[38:50] ourselves. In the sermon, behold I stand
[38:52] at the door and knock. Brother Bram says
[38:54] I can say can you show me somebody that
[38:56] belongs to church? Thousands. Can you
[38:58] show somebody that shouts? Thousands.
[39:01] Speaks with tongues, thousands. Works
[39:03] miracles, thousands. But show me
[39:05] somebody that size and cries for the
[39:07] abominations done in the
[39:09] church. That's I think that's
[39:11] remarkable.
[39:13] Thousands upon thousands that belong to
[39:15] church that that that shout that that
[39:17] speak with tongues that work miracles.
[39:19] But the question is, show me somebody
[39:22] that's signing and crying for the
[39:23] abominations done in the
[39:25] church. The existence of sin. when we
[39:28] see it. And those who are bound by sin
[39:29] should stimulate this deep response in
[39:32] us to impress upon others the need to
[39:35] have the mark,
[39:37] the need for
[39:39] salvation. And he says, "We then that
[39:41] are strong, we that are strong have a
[39:44] duty to lend a hand to those who are
[39:48] weak or unknowing or ignorant and don't
[39:51] know truth. We have a duty to those who
[39:53] are in bondage."
[39:56] Because Paul I I read it this way in one
[39:58] translation one time and it's always
[40:00] stuck with me. Strength is for service
[40:03] not
[40:04] status on this it's the way verses one
[40:06] and two uh were translated into uh uh
[40:09] from the original and it said strength
[40:11] your strength is for service not status.
[40:14] Right.
[40:17] Brother Brandham says in the sermon,
[40:18] "Leadership." Now look at yourself.
[40:20] Really? Are you a genuine Bible
[40:22] Christian full of the love of God? This
[40:25] is leadership December 7th, 1965.
[40:29] So this principle of marking them that
[40:31] side and cry is not a pre-seals idea
[40:33] because then he quotes Ezekiel chapter 9
[40:36] and he says is your heart so concerned
[40:38] about
[40:39] sinners and the way that the church and
[40:42] the people are doing till you sigh and
[40:43] cry about it day and
[40:46] night. This is at the heart they that
[40:49] are strong. My heart is so full the love
[40:52] of God that I'm impacted.
[40:55] There's this definition that we can
[40:56] become so full of the love of God in so
[40:59] much like Christ is just like just
[41:01] everyone just come just come just be
[41:03] yourself you that's shooting up over
[41:05] there in the corner do you need another
[41:06] needle are you good right there's just
[41:09] such a watering down where there's no
[41:11] real backbone anymore that's not what it
[41:15] means but to your heart is so full of
[41:17] the love of God you're strong enough to
[41:18] be concerned and be moved
[41:21] I'm going to quote brother Vincent again
[41:23] he says love is the best and most noble
[41:25] thing in the human heart, especially
[41:28] when it has been tried and tested in
[41:31] life like gold in the fire. Happy is he
[41:34] and strong in himself who has loved
[41:37] much. Think of the strength. You who are
[41:39] strong and even if he has wavered and
[41:41] doubted, has kept the divine fire and
[41:44] has returned to that which was in the
[41:46] beginning and shall never die. If only
[41:48] one continues to love faithfully that
[41:50] which is verily worthy of love and does
[41:53] not squander his love on the truly
[41:56] trivial trivial and insignificant and
[41:58] faint-hearted things, then one will
[42:00] gradually become more enlightened and
[42:03] stronger. The way that we project our
[42:06] love towards the word of God, the more
[42:07] that our faith is tried and tested, the
[42:10] more that it becomes uh uh like pure
[42:12] gold, the more enlightened, the more
[42:14] understand we come and the stronger that
[42:16] love becomes.
[42:18] because we don't we don't shift it. Our
[42:20] love isn't for trivial insignificant
[42:22] things. Our love isn't always just being
[42:24] projected in a way where it finds its
[42:26] root and its basis and its ideals in
[42:28] things that are not
[42:29] godly. But being fixed on Christ, the
[42:32] one who is worthy of all all love and
[42:35] all honor, our hearts being fixed on
[42:37] that, we gradually get stronger and
[42:39] stronger and stronger that we that are
[42:42] strong can bear the infirmities of the
[42:44] weak. Amen. Continuing in verse two, let
[42:46] every one of you us please his neighbor
[42:49] for his good to edification.
[42:52] Please his
[42:54] neighbor. Watch out for the good of
[42:56] those around you. Have your neighbor in
[42:58] mind. You're asking and and I want to
[43:00] put it particularly like this. Not so
[43:02] much, what can I do to help you today?
[43:04] Is that can I mow your lawn? Can I can I
[43:06] rake your rocks? It's more of how is it
[43:09] I can conduct myself and bear a
[43:11] testimony that's beneficial to them.
[43:14] Let every one of you please his neighbor
[43:16] for his good edification, for his
[43:18] building up, for his what's best. I have
[43:20] my best in mind for him. And then it
[43:21] says, for even Christ pleased not
[43:24] himself. He didn't make it easy on
[43:25] himself. He didn't make it better for
[43:28] himself. He didn't just criticize sin or
[43:30] just ignore sin, but he pleased on
[43:32] himself. But as it is written, the
[43:33] reproaches of them that reproached thee
[43:36] fell on me. Notice, I took on the
[43:39] troubles of the troubled. Amen. their
[43:42] burden of sin and the things that
[43:44] troubled you and the things that
[43:46] reproached you. I I've entered into that
[43:48] burden and I've looked and I've seen
[43:50] that that them being in sin, they need
[43:52] to be rescued from it. Was not being
[43:55] indifferent. Mark 10 21 then Jesus
[43:59] beholding him loved him. This is the
[44:01] rich young
[44:03] ruler. He's asked what can I do to
[44:05] master what can I do to obtain and have
[44:08] eternal life? And Jesus looks at him
[44:10] loves him. That word that's used there
[44:11] is he projected divine
[44:14] love. And how was this love projected?
[44:17] He said unto him, "One thing thou
[44:19] lackest. Go thy way. Sell whatsoever
[44:21] thou hast and give to the poor and thou
[44:23] shalt have treasure in heaven and come
[44:25] take up thy cross and follow me." The
[44:28] Bible says that this rich young ruler
[44:30] turned around grieved in his heart
[44:31] because he had much possessions. Jesus
[44:33] didn't love him and was afraid. He I
[44:34] don't want him to be grieved. I don't
[44:36] want him to feel these this dissonance.
[44:38] I don't want him to wrestle within
[44:39] himself. But love provoked him to tell
[44:42] him the truth of what he
[44:47] needed. We that are strong
[44:50] ought to bear the infirmities of the
[44:55] weak. That when we see others in sin, we
[44:57] see others faltering, we see others
[44:59] doing something that's wrong, that we
[45:01] grie. We're grieved in our spirits. We
[45:03] don't lash
[45:05] out. We we don't use names, name call or
[45:08] condescend. We don't just try to condemn
[45:12] people. We say, "Lord, help
[45:15] me to do
[45:18] good in a way that I could please for
[45:20] his good edification live." What's the
[45:22] right thing I can do as a neighbor to
[45:25] testify of Christ?
[45:32] I hope you can see kind of what I mean
[45:33] this morning. Am I strong enough to cry?
[45:37] We should be believers enough, Christian
[45:39] enough, strong enough, have faith
[45:41] enough, be convinced enough to cry out
[45:45] and our lives be a protest. Amen. The
[45:48] way we live, things we choose to do, the
[45:51] places we choose to go, the way that we
[45:53] choose to respond, I want to be a
[45:56] protest against sin.
[45:58] In the sermon, the 10 virgins and the
[46:00] 144,000 Jews, brother says, oh, he's
[46:02] saying about what they don't have. He
[46:04] says they don't have that constant
[46:05] burden for the lost, that sweetness. I'm
[46:08] just closing
[46:09] here. He says don't ever let anything
[46:12] rise up and put bitterness in your
[46:16] soul. Think of that. Don't you have to
[46:19] have a burden for the loss that
[46:20] sweetness. He says don't let anything
[46:22] put bitterness in your soul. What is it
[46:24] reflected? What is it related to? The
[46:26] witness you can be to the lost. The more
[46:28] bitter we become, the less effective
[46:30] witnesses we become. Right? It's what
[46:33] happens when people get bitter towards a
[46:35] church or a pastor or an ideology. They
[46:37] get bitter towards what they call
[46:39] something that they used to follow and
[46:41] believe in. They get bitter and then
[46:42] they're no longer burdened for the lost.
[46:44] They perceive the lost as those that are
[46:46] still locked in a system or doing
[46:48] something and that bitterness they just
[46:49] lash out. They try to destroy.
[46:52] They're motivated by the wrong things.
[46:53] He says we'd never let that bitterness
[46:56] rise up because it's going to sour that
[46:58] sweetness we ought to have for the lost
[47:01] souls. No matter how bad anyone ever
[47:03] treats you or anything, don't ever don't
[47:05] be guilty of letting that thing anchor
[47:06] in your soul. It'll grieve the Holy
[47:08] Spirit away from you.
[47:11] We must not become bitter towards sin.
[47:13] Bitter towards Leodysia. Hey, hate sin
[47:16] all you want. God hates sin. Be grieved
[47:20] by sin just as God is grieved by it.
[47:24] But do just as God did. Be that voice.
[47:29] There's going to be a cry. If there if
[47:31] we've heard the the the shout in this
[47:33] end time, if if we know what the word of
[47:35] God is orienting our minds and our
[47:37] hearts to, then Lord, I want my life to
[47:39] be a shout out against sin. I want to be
[47:42] a voice against
[47:44] sin, not railing, not
[47:47] fighting, but it's even put in that
[47:50] sense of a sweetness, a tenderness for
[47:52] lost souls.
[47:54] I'll invite the musicians to come to
[47:55] their instruments as we close, but if
[47:58] you could just focus with me just for
[48:00] another moment as I read this, take this
[48:02] into your heart. Think very deeply about
[48:03] this. Brother Benham says, "And what
[48:05] dust thou hear?" He says, "What we need
[48:07] tonight is that deep, rich
[48:09] experience, that something down in us,
[48:13] it don't have to shout, yet it might. It
[48:17] don't have to shout." Who's been hiding
[48:19] this quote from me?
[48:22] It don't have to shout yet it might. But
[48:26] we put all emphasis on our
[48:28] shouting. It's brother Brandham now. But
[48:30] we put all our emphasis on our shouting.
[48:32] It might never speak with tongues. Yet
[48:36] it might. But we put all emphasis on
[48:38] that. It might not attend Billy Graham's
[48:41] meetings or Robert's meetings. Good
[48:43] thing for
[48:45] us. Or my meeting. It don't have to. So,
[48:48] it's not which meetings you're going to.
[48:51] What it has to have, oh, okay, we got a
[48:54] we have a have to have. Doesn't have to
[48:56] have shouting. Doesn't have to have
[48:58] attending certain meetings. It doesn't
[49:00] have to have speaking in tongues. But
[49:01] what it does have to have is the depths
[49:03] of God's eternal love.
[49:06] The spirit on the inside of them that
[49:08] makes you what you are. That's what I
[49:11] was speaking about this morning. That's
[49:13] what I was pulling the church across
[49:14] Calvary back and forth. Do you think
[49:17] because you spoke with tongues or that
[49:19] you know so much about the scripture or
[49:21] you've read somebody's books you know
[49:24] more than the other fellow? He said put
[49:26] a mark on those that sigh and cry for
[49:29] the abominations that's done in the
[49:31] city. Who would he mark in our city
[49:36] tonight? I had I guess I uh read a quote
[49:39] on Jeffersonville, one on Dallas. Not
[49:42] that those are you know favorite
[49:43] targets. I thought I had one in here on
[49:45] Phoenix. And he says it in Phoenix, too.
[49:47] Who would he
[49:48] mark in Glendale and Buckeye and
[49:50] Goodyear and Mesa and Gilbert? Who would
[49:53] he mark in Surprise and in
[49:56] Anthem? Who would he surprise and
[49:58] prescuit and Flagstaff surprise? Who
[50:00] would he have mark in surprise? Who
[50:02] would he who would surprise God and he'd
[50:04] be able to mark? You know what I'm
[50:06] trying to
[50:07] say? Who would he mark in our cities
[50:11] tonight?
[50:13] [Music]
[50:18] I believe that if you have the seal of
[50:21] God, you've been marked.
[50:23] And what this sermon should do is unlock
[50:28] that part of the Holy Ghost that's
[50:30] inside of you that's been rubbing
[50:32] against the bitterness in your spirit,
[50:36] saying, "Soften a little. Sweeten a
[50:39] little." Those things you begrudge, pray
[50:41] for it.
[50:43] those things you hate. Pray for those
[50:45] that are in bondage to it. Pray so that
[50:48] your spirit gets softened and your heart
[50:49] gets softer. And then you could begin to
[50:51] actually
[50:53] weep and
[50:55] groan. And once that weeping and
[50:58] groaning takes begins to take place in
[50:59] your heart, then you're strong enough to
[51:03] cry. Then you can live a life that may
[51:06] by God's grace, my prayer is Lord, let
[51:08] me become sweet enough deep within my
[51:10] soul. He says, "In the depths there, the
[51:12] depths of God's eternal love, may it be
[51:15] deep enough so I can sigh so that my cry
[51:18] can be effective."
[51:21] I want to be a real genuine witness of
[51:23] this gospel. I listen to the message of
[51:26] the hour. Listen to brother Ben teach.
[51:27] He's had a lot. We are familiar with it.
[51:29] The
[51:30] criticisms, the the people trying to
[51:32] play psychologist with it, the way they
[51:34] try to characterize them. But there's
[51:36] one consistent theme I've heard my life
[51:38] personally, one thing I've heard from
[51:40] others who listen to it is that there
[51:41] was a genuiness. There was a
[51:44] sincerity. There was a tenderness and a
[51:46] softness for people's hearts. I want to
[51:48] have the love for God's word that'll
[51:50] make me a proper
[51:52] witness. God, help us today. If we could
[51:54] stand, we'll pray
[51:57] [Music]
[51:59] together with our heads bowed. If you
[52:01] desire prayer
[52:03] today and say, "Lord, mark, I I want to
[52:06] be
[52:07] [Music]
[52:11] marked." If you don't have this in your
[52:13] heart, search your heart. If there if
[52:15] there's been a lack of repenting of your
[52:17] own sins, if you've uh been stubborn and
[52:20] and haven't relented to the love of God
[52:23] for your heart to be changed, oh, by all
[52:25] means, don't become one who just now
[52:28] begins to rail against sin and you you
[52:29] yourself live in it. But if you've met
[52:33] him, know him, serving him, just
[52:35] reminding you today that one of the
[52:38] things that brother Brandham
[52:38] consistently and one of the things the
[52:40] scripture points out is that a heart for
[52:42] lost
[52:43] souls is at the heart of
[52:46] God. Not marking those who shout, not
[52:50] marking those who dance, not marking
[52:52] those that have read some certain books
[52:53] and know all the scriptures, but who is
[52:56] truly burdened for the lost? That's who
[52:59] the Holy Ghost would mark today. Our
[53:02] gracious heavenly father, Lord, as we
[53:04] close this service, we're praying that
[53:06] the things which we have heard would
[53:08] touch deeply within our
[53:11] hearts. Lord, I I know for myself that
[53:13] I'm looking at a very vast subject and
[53:15] to take a portion of it, minister it in
[53:18] less than an hour could in some ways
[53:20] leave a feeling of uncompleteness that
[53:23] it could be taken out of context. But I
[53:25] trust Lord that this could be rightly
[53:27] divided to the hearts of the people by
[53:29] your Holy
[53:30] Spirit so that they can understand what
[53:33] your true emphasis is and what your
[53:36] motivation is. Lord, we don't want to
[53:38] leave here and just become some sort of
[53:40] cliche about
[53:41] Christianity. We want to be
[53:43] real. We want to be we don't want to be
[53:46] hypocritical. We don't want to just put
[53:48] up a facade and run a booth or print out
[53:50] certain things and just find the right
[53:51] way to get the hook in there through
[53:53] social media. But Lord, just having that
[53:55] genuine authentic life that lives this
[53:57] word in its reality. We brush up against
[54:01] the world and we make contact with
[54:02] people in the world. We're conducting
[54:04] ourselves in the right way. And I
[54:05] believe Lord that just by handling
[54:08] ourselves appropriately as mothers and
[54:10] fathers, as sisters and brothers, as
[54:12] students and as parents, as teachers, as
[54:15] co-workers and bosses, Lord, and
[54:16] consultants, whatever it might be, that
[54:19] just by behaving in a way that is
[54:22] upright and godly in this present world,
[54:25] that is
[54:26] witness. That is
[54:30] witnessing. Help us to do it, Lord, for
[54:33] the sake of others.
[54:35] and that we could realize, Lord, that as
[54:37] we get stronger in your love, we become
[54:39] stronger. We become more able to cry as
[54:42] Christ
[54:45] did. Bless your people today, those that
[54:47] are here with us. If they have any
[54:48] needs, Lord, we're committing them to
[54:50] you. Heal, Lord, those that are
[54:53] sick. Comfort those who are hurting.
[54:56] Deliver those who are bound. Save those
[54:59] that are
[55:00] lost. Encourage those who are
[55:02] discouraged, Lord. that mind right now
[55:05] that is just so cobwebbed and cloudy and
[55:07] fuzzy and it's not seems like nothing
[55:09] but white noise and there's nothing
[55:11] discernable. Lord, may that still small
[55:13] voice resonate from the heart. Just open
[55:15] up the cloud so that the sun can shine
[55:18] in. We love you. We commit the people to
[55:20] you now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:22] Christ. Amen.
