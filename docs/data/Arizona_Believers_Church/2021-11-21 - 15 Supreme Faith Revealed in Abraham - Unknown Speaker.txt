TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 15 i want to read the entire chapter it's not a very long one but i want to read the entire one just to share um some very you know a couple very significant instances in abraham's life but there's a theme we know that these verses are really lifting up christ and pointing to um jesus christ in the uh in one portion and then also god even revealing to abraham some of the future of his seed and his generation generations after him so real important scriptures but i have a very specific thought i want to bring out of it genesis chapter 15 starting with verse one after these things and these things were the battle with the kings and the melchizedek coming to visit him the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what will thou give me see and i go childless and the steward of my house is the eliezer is this eleazar of damascus and abram said behold to me the house given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir we recognize that abram is actually suggesting that a son born of his servant eliezer could he be the one that you spoke of could he be the one that the blessing pertains to but then the lord is going to reaffirm and promise abram an heir of his own and behold the word lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and that a marvelous scripture that he just believed god and this was imputed to abram as righteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the counties to give thee this land to inherit it and again abram he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it and he said in him take me a heifer of three years old and a she-goat to three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst so there had been a cleaving a separating of the flesh and laid each piece one against another but the bird divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses abram drove them away when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and loa and horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abram no of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years god already prophesying the bondage in egypt and also that nation whom they they shall serve will i judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance so this is prophecy of them being in bondage in egypt for 400 years and then he speaks to him and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt under the great river the river euphrates the canaanites and the kinseth canazites and the catamites and the hittites and the perizzites and the rafeems and the amorites and the canaanites and the gergescites and the jebusites amen let's just say a quick prayer heavenly father we thank you for your presence that is with us today for the desire that we have to be in your house for the anticipation that we have for your word and we ask that you would come now bless the words which we have read and speak plainly to our hearts that we might be benefited by your scripture as you give us revelation bless your people now we pray in jesus name amen you can be seated we've been taking this subject on supreme faith revealed in abraham our our goal has been to look at abraham's life and emphasize points that relate to our faith or would allow us to relate to our own faith our own calling our own election and then begin to recognize as we relate to abraham's faith through our own faith and then kind of see the process whereby god wants to perfect our faith and i feel that i'm nearing the end of this series and maybe just have one more service on it that i would say for sure that's on my heart i just thought as i prepared yesterday just to kind of go back in my own mind over the services that we had spoke on this subject already and we've had 14 parts on it today the 15th part and in the first three parts we were looking at how abraham is an example of our faith as brother branham said he was determined to be an example for people of today so there's a an example that abraham gives in his life that is indicative of or exemplifies the faith of god's elect and that we can draw from him an example for ourselves and for the next few parts um we begin to look at how the bride's rapturing faith is expressed in abraham's supreme faith so abraham offering up isaac as a sacrifice was rooted in this revelation that death could not defeat god's promises and so abraham being delivered from the fear of death was able to to take isaac and offer him up as a sacrifice and so we spent a a few services on that particular subject just tying in supreme faith of abraham with the with the bride's faith rapturing faith and then for the last several parts we have been looking at how maybe in different ways trying to identify the events and circumstances in abraham's life maybe types in his life and how it is relatable to us just even looking at how god called him out of babylon and how we too are called out of a spiritual babylon looking at how that god sent adam and the woman away from eden but god was actually doing something to call man back to eden in the path and the life of abraham even to the point to where as abram found himself between two edens and there was an eden that had been forsaken but there's going to be an eden to come and eternal eden abraham finding himself between two edens kind of became this uh critical turning point to where we begin to look forward to the new jerusalem and then melchizedek in genesis 14 comes down and serves them commune right on the very spot where the new jerusalem is going to descend out of heaven from god so a lot of different things we begin to look at and that and that the life of abraham and different circumstances that would make his faith relatable and then even looking at how that god separated him from lot and then separating him from lot there's a type that shows us separation from unbelief and separation from religion and formality and different things that hinder our faith and then we've uh and kind of over those few services we've been looking at how there's things in genesis chapter 1 2 3 and 4 that connects so deeply to the life of abraham in a lot of ways abraham's life is just picking up where things were cut off in genesis chapter 3 and picking up on things that took place in genesis chapter 4. so for us there's a tremendous revelation about abraham's life that's hid in those first several chapters of the bible and so those are just that's just me kind of resetting what we've gone over through those first several parts and uh and you're thinking it took you 14 parts to do it and you did it fairly well just there in the last four minutes so um it just goes to show how much can be contained in just those few things but with that as a foundation i do want to look at abraham's story as a whole again and and say this at the outset and and so this is if you if you take notes you could write this down and this will tell tell you my my this is my thesis and this will express what i wanted to share with you this morning as we look at the story of abraham and we look into his life and we read the instances that have taken place in his life and i've just been going back through and reading through the story it's not very long but you just can sit down and read through all of it very quickly and i've just been doing that on a regular basis looking at a story and what i want to say today is that the story of abraham reveals more about the character of god than it does about abraham and that's the part i really want you to ponder today is that the story when we read about abraham's life yeah we're learning some details about his life but he lived to a good old age 175 years old i believe he lived too and um and much of it's not recorded we have it recorded from i think around 75 years old to maybe some instances around when he was 130 something years old so there's a lot about abraham's life that we're not told about there's a lot of things he did a lot of things that he accomplished and we when we read about his story it reveals more to us about god's character than it does about abraham's character and that's important just to kind of pick on this a little bit and i think that i'm not suggesting that any of you are finding yourselves wrestling in this particular area and i certainly wouldn't suggest that what i just said is some tremendous revelation but i think we need to be reminded of it because abraham's personality um abraham's experiences that he went to his character his particular pathway in life his trajectory the things that he went through his exact circumstances all those things are not the basis of our faith because remember we call abraham the father of our faith we see many details of his life expressed more details in his life than any other character in the bible to this point and so we want to be sure that when we see him as the father of our faith it's not that we're rooted in his own experiences or in what he went through but that our faith is resting on something else and it's in this particular area where oftentimes it's a temptation to make someone else's testimony our basis for believing something just what somebody else said and uh what somebody else has experienced and we make their testimony our basis for expecting and you think well isn't that what a testimony is for there's really a fine line between a testimony misleading you or weakening your faith in a testimony encouraging your faith people can share something express something and give their testimony but it's not just their testimony that becomes the basis of our believing a testimony is something that is evidenced per evidence provided by the existence of something so something exists and it testifies of it it's the evidence of something and so it means to witness or to record that's what a testimony is and brother brahm says and these testimonies are give and he's just referring to these testimonies he was sharing and i found that this statement was very enlightening how that we ought to take testimonies when someone shares an experience and someone tells you something that happened in their life then there's there's something we're looking for to to speak to our hearts to encourage our faith he says these testimonies are given in the light of the gospel that people who are sick and needy might receive help and blessings from the gospel so the testimonies were shared not to lift up brother branham not merely just to vindicate the gift that he had but he's sharing these testimonies in the light of the gospel so these things that are being expressed have some harmony and continuity with the gospel and then as they are being expressed and and or in the light of the gospel those who are needy and need help can receive the help and the blessings that they need from the gospel so the testimony is supporting and lifting up the gospel in the message of hidden life in christ brother branham makes this is a very very uh exceptional statement he says and many times we substitute so much instead of the word especially today we're substituting phenomenal so if there can be some sort of phenomena something phenomenal something flashy and exciting we'll just take that over the word we're substituting a lot of other things that shouldn't be after all church is for preaching the word then he says testimonies are fine acknowledging that testimonies are good and we appreciate testimonies and we ought to have one and we should have freedom and liberty to give them he says in different things that we do is wonderful but we must give the word the first place because it's for the sinner and for the people that have the holy spirit also and this could be expressed in this in this way that when you have a church service uh testimonies are wonderful but testimony shouldn't overrun the service and uh just uh and if church becomes more just people testifying he's saying well that's uh that's not what church is for church is for pre for the word of god church is for preaching the word because the word is for the sinner the word is for those who have the holy spirit also and so it's the word that has to have the preeminence and so i want you to even think about this as he highlights and emphasizes that the word ought to have the preeminence that's really at the end of the day what a testimony ought to point to is it ought to point to the word i if you just gave an example and you gave a scenario and said i was doing this and i was doing that and the lord spoke to me and i did this and that happened well that's your experience and could very very unique and it could very well in fact be god but i'm only going to learn what your experience was and understand your history and what you've been through and not receive a benefit unless that testimony somehow can point back to something in the word of god and give me a basis to believe the same thing for myself because there's things that happen be like my god did that for you and that happened and you walk away going well i must not have any faith or god must not be in my life and or you might think well i don't think that happened we should resist the urge to say i don't think that really happened that's between them and the lord uh but if it's ant if it's contrary to scripture even brother bran was in a scenario says um you're a woman preacher and i think she said that she felt caught god called her to preach he's saying i'm not saying he didn't he said but it's not according to his word and so there's a difference maybe in recognizing even in that particular situation but we have to realize that if we can't bring it back to the word maybe we don't understand whether or not it really happened maybe we can't uh figure out whether or not that's god but that's for that person but it speaks to this point testimonies ought to be lifting up the character nature of god and pointing to something in the word so that others hearing it can be benefited by it and receive a blessing of it and so the testimony of abraham reveals to us the character of god the life story of abraham is not just a story of a great man or a man who wasn't great that became great it's not just history but abraham's testimony and his life and what is expressed through his circumstances and his events show us the attributes of god they're opening up to us the nature and character of god through the word and we recognize it's through the word god dealing with him the word being given to abraham it being even memorialized in the scripture we're not just reading this to know abraham's life but god wants to use abraham's life to show us something about himself and so the growth from abram to abraham the transformation from abram uh a chaldean out of ur to abraham is inspiring it really is an inspiring story if we just look at abraham's life and we read about it and i i think even if we begin to ponder just how extraordinary the battle with the kings was and how he just takes trained servants and he goes and does battle and how fearless that would seem and his journeys and everything he went through he said it's very inspiring in it and it's a tremendous story with tension and different things to keep us engaged but what's what's greater than just that inspiration of what took place in abraham's life is the unfolding of god that's taking place in this and i i want to and i'm going to back up a little bit and and go over some things in the first 11 chapters of genesis just so you could kind of understand how i'm wanting to place this abraham's life because well let's just we know what we're doing we're bible believers we've read the bible from genesis to revelation we're message believers we hear the word of god we've been going to church all of our lives so we see the whole picture already but i want to zero in on what the picture would have been when abraham's life began because if you look at let's just ponder this for a moment what genesis chapter 1 through genesis chapter 11 teaches us about the character of god that if all we had were the first 11 chapters of the bible what are some of the things that we could say with certainty about the lord about his about who he is i said well tell me about god tell me about his nature tell me about his character uh we could read and conclude that he's eternal because god is an eternal god and that from this this eternal god was also a creator and that he was creating and he and and even in the names that are used of god at the time we could say he was he this self-existing one who created and wrapped up these laws within creation and these uh these things and these elements that bound things together so he's eternal he's a creator and we could read and see that he's one that grants privileges because he says i'm gonna give this to man and you're gonna be able to do this and you're gonna be able to do that so he grants power and privileges to man we see him as a lawgiver because this is really what he's doing in the garden of eden is he's laying down the law this is what you should do this is what you must do this is what you can't do and this is all just really looking in the first couple chapters of genesis first few chapters we see that he's a law enforcer god said the day you eat that day you die sure enough what did god do he he did exactly what he said he was going to do he came down and was a man of his word he's very strict we can say he's very rigid man he really meant it when he said don't eat of the fruit of that tree so god is a a law giver he's a law enforcer and if we took and i wanted to maybe go over this very quickly if we look at everything that god did in those first 11 chapters we would say he's a man of justice a god of justice because the the instances that stand out the most god is punishing adam god is punishing cain uh in chapter six he's punishing the whole world and then after that he comes down and confuses the whole world so god is one that punishes adam he punishes cain he punishes the woman he punishes the serpent uh he he floods the whole earth and and kills everyone but eight people we're learning about the character of god right we're just looking at if all we had were the first 11 chapters of the bible this is what we would be drawing from and then the last chapter we would have god sees that man is getting together and is ambitious and they're building something and building a tower and building a city and he comes and confuses all humanity and disperses them in chaos over the whole earth and what we be what stood out to me as i begin to look at it this way is that we really see god in his response to unbelief what what brought god down uh not that he hadn't come down before but what brought the voice of god down in the garden in the cool the evening unbelief that the sin of the woman and adam it brings god down in in in garden in the garden it brings him down to address unbelief really the next instance that we see god is god talking to cain when his and when his sacrifice was not acceptable and so we see him addressing the unbelief in the garden out of the garden addressing cain and then we see him um uh talk uh talking even with noah and discussing things with noah as it relates to unbelief and then we see him in babylon dealing with sin and unbelief in babylon god in the first 11 chapters of the bible offers two conditional covenants one with adam one with noah and in this he establishes a relationship with adam he establishes a relationship with noah with certain obligations that were on noah and adam's part but also obligations on god's part but we see that really on god's part it's that if you breach this there's consequences and in genesis chapter 9 verses 9 to 11 it says and i will establish my covenant with you this is with noah neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood neither shall there be any more there anymore be a flood to destroy the earth so this is this is god's covenant and think about it what god is saying is not that i won't punish you again i'm just not going to use water to do it and could you imagine if he said but i will use fire right because that's going to be that's what he does next and this is what god's saying all right fine i won't flood the earth anymore and this is something that really struck me as i pondered this is then in genesis chapter 11 they in the tower of babel what was it based upon it demonstrates that the people that are inhabiting the earth didn't trust god's covenant of genesis chapter 9. he said look i won't flood the earth anymore but they still need to build a tower they're wanting to get to higher elevation they're wanting to figure out a way hey if this happens again is there a way that we can construct something to where we can save a life and possessions in some sort of uh fortification that could withstand flood waters and it shows that mankind didn't trust this covenant and they didn't want to spread out and they built a tower and it's related directly to not believing god in genesis 9 when he says i won't flood the earth anymore think about the instances where we see god present with man talking to men we only see god when he's speaking to man and visiting with man and it's when we see god visiting with man and speaking with man it's usually with respect to judgment it's usually in relation to sin something has happened whether it be with adam in the garden cain outside of the garden he comes and knows oh this is beautiful no beautiful he's talking to noah but what does he say you're the only one i see with of righteousness in all the world mankind is totally and completely evil and so he's only if you think about the way that god speaks the voice of god seeking adam in the garden god dealing with cain after the wrong offering and after murder the wickedness of man in the days of noah um what we what we're beginning to see is that any time we hear from god it's because mankind has done something wrong we could perhaps look at maybe just a glimpse of god's grace in cain and maybe a glimpse of god's mercy and noah but the real thrust of god's visitation with man is i'm we had a covenant and you broke it so i'm here to enforce it i'm here i'm here to enforce my remedies under this contract and that's when we see god speaking to adam speaking to cain speaking to noah coming down in the tower of babel it's usually related to some sort of conflict with the na and the nature of man with the word of god and if all we had were the first 11 chapters of the bible most of what we would have is god saying if you make a mistake i'm going to punish you if you don't do things right there's going to be a price to pay for and this is the covenant i've made with you and this is the these are the consequences if you don't keep it and so that would create a particular relationship with god uh and i don't mean to take too much liberty with this but really it's indicative of what the people did in the time at the time of the tower of babel is they're not trusting god completely but with abraham's life we have an opportunity to watch god's character unfold to that point the the nature and character of god would have only been told by oral tradition what we have even when we read the book of genesis it's written by moses these different books that are written much later and are able to bring in certain elements that would not even necessarily be known at the time but the anyone on earth at that time would have only known god really by oral tradition or by history and by virtue of it only be an oral tradition in history and there's uh you could just really focus with me today and i feel that you're paying attention and i appreciate that and i'm really going to need your help to make it through the service as i said before the harder you pull the faster i'll preach i know some people just woke up like really we're going to drag him through this but this i really hope you can focus and i because i feel that there's something very deep here that we need to connect with and catch that there would have been a story an oral history about god and god did this and the god of our fathers and the god of this person the god of that person there would have been rich things that were shared but you could see the failure of that in that polytheism and the worship of many gods begins there in babylon because the truth of god is getting watered down from one testimony anecdotal story experience from one person to the next to where the true nature of god is being lost and genesis chapter 11 verse 11. it tells us shem lived 500 years after the birth of one of his sons and you can see then that shem even if you track it and if it's many people commentators agree with this hashem would have outlived abraham living the number of years that he did and so shem being alive and i believe noah died just a few years before abraham was born so think about that noah would have been alive just prior to or before abraham being born and sham is alive one that was on the ark one that lived before the flood he's seen the hand of god he's seen the miracle he's seen these different experiences he's experienced these things and so as he lives hundreds of years after the flood he would have been able to share his own experience he would have been able to give his own understanding of certain events and he would have had a testimony but even in that testimony and i want you to partner this as men share the testimonies shem would have talked about the god who judged the entire earth the the testimony of god the nature and character of god would have still been shrouded in mystery again i want you to think of it this way what we know about him today we kind of have to say well let's just let's just think about what he what would have been known about him then the probing of man the thoughts of man man's search for meaning trying to make sense why are we all here why are these things taking place and uh and all the different things they'd be wrestling with we have the benefit of 6 000 years of man trying to answer the question why are we here what's this all about man search for meaning but at the time there would have been such a mystery of trying to figure out purpose and how did we get here and what caused this and what caused that and the testimony of god would be hidden behind so much mystery but then the details that would be expressed what would be the takeaway shem says yeah one day god called my dad to build an ark because he was going to kill everybody else on earth and that's your takeaway so there's this cloaking of god's nature and character behind judgment based upon the experience of mankind but in genesis chapter 15 verse 7 this is god's testimony now kind of jumping in into the middle of this and this is what god says about abraham's life and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee i want you to catch it i am the lord that he's he's actually giving some context for who he is and he's wanting to express something about what he has done so that he can be identified i am the lord that brought thee out of er of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit if you could kind of hold this thought in your mind as we carry this forward i am the lord that brought thee out he's not saying i'm the god that told you to go or i'm the god that called you out but i am the god that led you out i'm the one that brought you forth which means to lead and to direct i am the one that took you so he says i am the lord that brought thee out god's the one that's doing it god didn't send him a letter and say hey i'm down here in kane and get here as fast as you can or god didn't just one day knock on his door and say hey get out of here and send them away but god is implying that he took abraham and he walked with him and led him out of er the chaldees and that phrase there ur of the chaldees we might think oh herb that's a city but though even the way that it's phrased is very unique i brought you out of er the chaldees it means the flame or the fire of chaldea i brought you out of the flame of babylon i brought you out of the fire of babylon and even from this very phrase i brought you out of ur which means flame or fire of the chaldees there's a jewish tradition that believes that abraham was delivered out of the fiery furnace of nimrod for refusing to obey some false god because the meaning of this phrase is i brought you out of the fire in the flame of chaldea i am jehovah who led you out of the flame i am jehovah who led you out of the fire to give you this land to possess god is actually making a personal connection with abraham i am the god that brought v he's connecting himself with abraham and he's and in this identification something begins to rise up that i believe we can see is very pronounced in the scripture is he's not the god of noah he's the god of abraham there's an identity that god begins to form to where he's he's he's showing himself to one man very personally i am the jehovah that led you out of the fire of babylon to give you something to possess god is becoming personal to abraham not just in the way that shem could be dramatically telling the story that god came down and spoke to my father noah and told them to build the ark because the whole world is going to be destroyed by a flood and he preached this for so long and no one believed him and he preached it for a hundred years but finally one day we and our wives that were called to gather into the ark and and after so many days the door was shut and then the rain began to fall and we were on this ark for so long and begin to tell the testes that god said he would do it god did it and everyone stands in awe of this god and what would be developed and i want you to think about this mythology is being developed in some ways stories that survive today in all cultures across all every culture every religion has a what's called the flood myth or flood mythology where oh this this civilization was destroyed by flood and and this god got angry because this lesser god did this to this other god and so he caused a flood to sweep over the whole island and civilizations and people are destroyed there's a lot of myths that would be developed and if all you're doing is hearing what somebody else said and walking away and all you have is somebody else's word for it then in some ways that's all you have is a myth it's interesting to think about happy thanksgiving now romans chapter 4 verses 11 to 16 i want to read this and hopefully be able just to read it um just read through it and not get stopped too much it says and he re speaking now of abraham and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised so the seal of god which is the new birth was according to the faith that he had that he might but which is the type of the new birth that he might be the father of all the circumcision is the type of that that he might be this is the phrase i'm wanting to see that he might be the father of all them that believe this is very strong words of of paul abraham is the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised and we realize that he's trying to draw this distinction between they have the circumcision and those of the uncircumcision to see how the gospel has turned to the jews and that it's not the circumcision of the flesh that makes you a son or daughter of god but he says he's the father of all them that believe that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law which would be israel but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all that what i'm wanting to emphasize is how that abraham is identified in the scripture as the father of all those that believe and he or he's the first he's a progenitor he's the parent of all other believers and the phrase the father of all them that believe the father of circumcision to them who are not circumcised the faith and he says that the steps of the faith of our father abraham that he is the uh he's the father and it's to the promises to those which are of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all remember abraham means exalted father of a great multitude he is the father of the faith paul is saying he is the father of us all that puts abraham in a very unique position right we talk about his faith is legendary so much so that we more idolize him than we do relate to him but abraham is the father of faith the father of us all the father of jews father of gentiles in faith in their belief and conviction of god he writes it this way to the galatians galatians chapter 3 verse 9 so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham let's not lose sight of kind of what my my story the ark of my story is today that the character of god is revealed in the life of abraham and all we would have to go by god's character would have been the instances from genesis chapter 1 to genesis chapter 11. but now in abraham we're having an opportunity to see very deeply into the character of god and as the scripture looks at abraham he is the father of us our faith the father of us all the father of all them that believe and abraham is called faithful abraham trustee he's true he's believing faithful abraham he's one that believes and you'll find that as paul talks about abraham faith is the primary character that paul emphasizes the primary character of abraham that is emphasized in the new testament abraham is the father of faith he's the father of all them that believe he's called faithful abraham and his this designation of faithful abraham and abraham's character being called faithful is not about his reputation with mankind if i uh um not that you're looking at me like a mule at a new gate but i feel like i come like i haven't preached on abraham for the last 14 services in some ways i don't know if it's too hot or too cold if we need to loosen up a little bit relax and open up your hearts to receive from the lord but if it's not abraham's reputation with man that caused everybody say there's faithful abraham if he tells you he's going to do something he does it there's faithful abraham you can trust in him you can really really rely on him but the character faithful to abraham was about his faith in god when he's called faithful abraham it's not his dependency it's not his trustworthiness it's not that we could believe abraham but that abraham believed god and in james chapter 2 verses 22 to 23 this has been a very significant scripture for us in this series he says see us now how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect how that when he offered up isaac as a sacrifice and so he's saying see how that his faith was wrought with his works and by the works of abraham in offering up isaac his faith was made perfect now notice what verse 23 says and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so this is when the scripture there's a fulfillment of these things expressed to abraham abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and notice this phrase and he was called the friend of god that's an extraordinary phrase abraham is called the friend of god in other words god took abraham as his own friend abraham being called the friend of god abraham becomes a companion and even a confident of god that god takes him as a friend and he has a relationship with abraham and we can see this expressed how that when god is going to judge sodom and gomorrah what the khan if i say conflict but notice the internal dialogue that god has within himself he says can i hide this thing from abraham what i'm about to do oh this is how a friend feels when he knows something and he knows that his friend would want to know and he's like hey i can't hide this for you anymore i've got to tell you this secret i got to tell you what i'm about to do you're the first one to know anybody have a friend like that you don't have to raise your hand look we're all we all don't have a friend like that so glad i have a friend in jesus nobody knows the trouble i feel but abraham had a friend that was excited to share with him or belonged to and wanted to share with him things that only he knew and this is demonstrative of the friendship that god had with abraham think of this phrase he was called the friend of god in john chapter 15 verses 13 to 16 greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends there's no greater love than this love that would cause a man to lay down his life for his friends this is what christ is going to do for his friends and notice how he speaks to his disciples ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you so you're a friend if you do what your friend says right friends right so a friend if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things here's another designation of what a friend is a friend is one that does what somebody else with a friend says to do and there is another designation of this friendship with god for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you so through friendship special knowledge is imparted through friendship special things are revealed and shared and then in the context of that relationship and that friendship the things that are received are acted upon and so there's a difference then servants and those who are servants and have a particular knowledge of god and a certain obedience and strictness or discipline to him who do it uh through certain functions and forms and then there's a difference in those who are friends of god who are friends of christ who special knowledge is made known to them and then they act upon that obediently and then notice how beautiful this is you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you we know that we can this is him picking his friends so he says i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you this is friendship this is the relationship that jesus is now expressing to the seat of abraham look i have chosen you i have called you we walk together i'm sharing you the things that the father shows me how can i not share with you the things that have been shared with me i must tell you these secret things i must speak plainly to you and then you are my friends because you do what i'm asking you to do and he's describing this beautiful relationship and you'll find that abraham seed entered into this relationship with the seed of abraham and abraham meets both of these requirements in his relationship with god god is has made abraham a friend abraham was loved by god with an unfailing love god showed great kindness to him and a stubborn grace he showed a relentless mercy towards him and god took great care of abraham he called him by grace he blessed him with spiritual blessing natural blessings he increased him and gave him possessions god favored him you find that god communed with him god honored him think about this god was so tight with abraham that god made abraham's friends his friends and abraham's enemies his enemies think about it like this is this i was gonna say it's the original bromance but that's maybe more modern parlance but god is saying hey i i'm sticking with you if anybody's got beef with you they've got beef with me if you're good with somebody else they're good with me we know what those kind of relationships are like right oh you're a friend of his then you're a friend of mine oh he's their enemy then he's my enemy and god is literally saying abraham we're in this together whoever curses you i curse him whoever blesses you i'll bless him whoever your friends are or my friends whoever your enemies are my enemies this is god expressing the friendship that he had with abraham and so when we and i and i shared that portion to express this about the character of faithful abraham abraham's faithfulness as the bible calls it is a reflection of his friendship with christ or with god abraham's faithfulness isn't like abraham was a good dude everybody wanted to follow him everybody liked him everybody wanted to be his friend he was really really popular god got really jealous showed up in earth separated it from his crew brought him in the middle of nowhere and canaan was really jealous and possessive held him to himself abused him and manipulated him to where god was his only friend had no other families had no other friends and it was only god and he finally got him to himself anybody ever been in a relationship like that they're the worst that's not what god did that's not what god was doing with abraham god was not uh god had become and it wasn't something in abraham that god that he was faithful and he was good and he was kind and he was rich and and he had a particular reputation but god that abraham's faithfulness what was brought out of him and what he became that the scripture can memorialize him as the father of all that believe the father of circumcision and uncircumcision and the faith of abraham who is the father of us all and call him faithful abraham and to be called the friend of god abraham's faithfulness is a reflection of that friendship a reflection of the influence he yielded himself to really speaks to the importance of having the right kind of friends because he's called faithful abraham but you'll find in the scripture there's only one other person who's called faithful there's a servant who's faithful in all his house and there's different references to faithfulness but as far as a characterization of one who's faithful it says in deuteronomy 7 9 know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god how is it that abraham became faithful abraham he was under the headship of the faithful god god chose abraham to be his disciple god chose to guide him to teach him to encourage him when he said i called you out of the fire of cow dee and brought you i'm going to lead you i'm going to shepherd you i'm going to guide you and i'm going to be with you this is this is the the thrust that i want i want to emphasize at this in this moment faithful abraham that characterization of faithful abraham he's received that character because he has yielded himself to the influence of god and god being faithful it made abraham faithful that's why abraham could be called faithful abraham notice this this god his god inserting himself into abraham's life in genesis chapter 15 verse 1. after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward what a what a contrast to adam now that without we don't know what abraham was going through exactly in this whether or not maybe he's fearing reprisal from the kings or he's worried if this is going to become a regular thing with lot we don't really have much context as to why god wanted to tell him not to fear we addressed we looked at before how there was this underlying fear that abraham had about death that that came up in certain instances but he's saying fear not abram and notice how beautiful that is he calls him by name so it's not just get thee out and do this and do that but he wants to use his name and in using his name he's wanting to bring this familiarity he's wanting him to know abram i'm speaking your name he's using his name to calm him to allay his fears to comfort him and he says i am thy shield which is buckler i am thy covering i am thy surrounding and and thy exceeding great reward i am your recompense i am your wage and this becomes a language that is unique to abraham that what god is saying to abraham like these words that are kind of in our vocabulary you want to know their genesis with abraham we begin to think of god and certain attributes of god and characteristics of god and and things that are rehearsed and and spoken of quite often in in the psalms and in the prophets and of the children of israel and find this beautiful language describing god well we we know about it because he told abraham i am thy covering i am thy surrounding i am your shield and i will be your wage i will be your recompense this is a language that is special to abraham notice in ruth chapter 2 verse 12 when boaz is speaking to ruth he says the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust he is reciting the blessing of abraham he is using words that are expressed of god's relationship to abraham and abraham's faithfulness to god in god's blessing upon abraham and then by extension to the seed after him these are words that relate and have their genesis in the relationship that god had to abraham i will recompense thy work a full reward will be given thee the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust you think of how god is speaking to abraham and raising up these things i'll be your shield i'll be your buckler i'll be your your exceeding great reward and he's coming to calm abraham's fears remember god placed adam and the woman on a conditional covenant and i want to be very careful on how i phrase this because we know that they had a perfect understanding of the love of god and there was perfection all around them but yet in reality there was a limited revelation of god and and so in this conditional covenant that is limited in other words you you can you can go beyond this and break it there's this there's something that was capitalized on in the fall that produced the doubt and then on this basis of this covenant in genesis chapter 3 verses 8 verses 8 9 and 10 after the fall here's adam and they they heard and the woman they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said to him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself i i'd like to just say something very quickly and and perhaps not expound upon it very much but why was adam afraid the covenant the reason why adam was afraid and he hid himself is he was told i'm going to make a promise with you you can eat everything and have dominion and bring forth and do genesis 1 28 have dominion have power bring forth seed do all this but there's one thing you can't do eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil because the day you eat that day you die that's the covenant and so when adam breaks and transgresses the covenant he's afraid because of the covenant so adam is acting in fear and he's all nervous and he's all worried and so this is god in that moment in that instance when mankind is afraid notice god doesn't say adam be not afraid he's saying where are you where are you why did you hide why are you hiding well i heard your voice and i was afraid well why why are you afraid it's the woman she did it to me well what did she do well you know that thing you told me not to do and it's and god says you know what because you've done this and judgment just starts to go forth and so adam with what he would have known about god and experienced about god there's still this fear that comes up in a moment of unbelief in god's judgment immediate judgment because of it and then if we could kind of take this out a step further and begin to think about how the situation would be after the fall after the fall those that have come forth whether it be able and cane and all the different seed that would come forth after the fall from genesis 5 all the way to genesis 11. they don't even have the knowledge and understanding that adam had so think of how adam relates to god in the garden he's thrust out under a punishment but then with the promise of genesis 3 15 so there's this hope that's given we see god giving revelation to abel we see god correcting cain but from that moment on mankind is going to have a much more limited understanding with god and really the fellowship communion and relationship that mankind had with god was cut off through the fall so this is mankind as it exists and begins to populate the earth they don't even know god at all the way that adam knew him so in abraham god is building back relationship and abraham god is building back fellowship he's building back communion god has established in a relationship with one man and he's going to deal with him over the course of his life a greater portion of his life and deal with him in certain ways so that abraham can come to know god and build relationship build fellowship build communion ultimately to build what trust faithfulness i was blessed by the song great as thy faithfulness this was the theme that was in my heart as god began to call abraham god is wanting to build trust and so god as he deals with abraham in in abraham's difficulty and and i guess i could say he says fear not abraham and abraham's immediate thought is well i've got this servant in my house maybe he's the one that's going to be the heir god is renewing the covenant god is confirming the covenant god is sharing things with abraham why he's wanting to establish relationship and build trust different than what took place in the garden it was adam broke trust there was immediate punishment and if i could say things in a way that kind of summarizes every circumstance in abraham's life every condition that existed in his life was an opportunity to learn to trust god or an opportunity to demonstrate trust in god think about the life of abraham in that regard that every condition every circumstance every weakness every trial everything he went through was either an opportunity to learn to trust god or to demonstrate trust that he had learned god was going to establish he needed to god was going to establish a basis to express his love some sort of context to express his nature and build trust and to build faith it says in psalms 36 7 how excellent is i loving kindness oh god i've heard that before how excellent is i love and kindness and the writer says therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings why is it that the children of men put their trust under the shadow of his wings because how excellent is thy loving kindness do you notice it's this knowledge of the excellency of his loving kindness that causes man to trust under the shadow of his wings it's like come over here you your knucklehead i'm going to let you have it it's like oh god here i come it's not that kind of brutish intimidation and threat it's like because of thy excellent loving kindness we've come to trust under the shadow of thy wings this is what's made known to abraham and his seed the excellency of his loving kindness that was compelling to the seed of abraham to learn to trust under his wing i want to read psalm 91 verses 1 to 6 and since i want to i will and reading this i hope that you can kind of catch how this language spoken of now about god start to put abraham in this figure and how this is first expressed in the man abraham psalm 91 1-6 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high this phrase the most high it's very important just trying to see where i'm at in this the most high means supreme he that dwell from the secret place of the supreme shall abide under the shadow of the almighty under the almighty shadow notice what's there under this shadow i will say of the lord he is my refuge in my fortress my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with thy feathers this is a language amplifying what god said abram i am thy shield i am your recompense he is my refuge my fortress i will trust in him he will deliver thee he will cover thee under his wing shout thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid abram don't be afraid i am thy shield for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in the darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday notice how beautifully these things are being expressed from the seed of abraham about the the wings of the almighty saying come trust under my wings and you've come to trust under these wings how excellent is i loving kindness i'm wanting to express this attribute of how that god takes his wings and gathers somebody close to his bosom and it's there that it's this place of safety to learn to trust this one that has gathered you learn to trust this one that is speaking you learn to trust this one that is feeding you and that's what god wants to build we use the word faith but recognize that faith is trust i want you to trust me this is so this is where the this this most high we see this first come up in relationship to abraham in genesis 14 verses 18 to 21 and melchizedek king of salem king of peace king of shalom king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god the supreme supreme god and he blessed him and he said bless be abram i love this of the most high god that only the god of abraham that's abraham of the god of abraham abraham of the most high it becomes interchangeable now i am the god of abraham this is abraham of the god the most high god abraham of the supreme possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god so now abram is blessed now the supreme is blessed who have delivered thine enemies into thy hand why because he said i will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler i'll be your fortress i'll be your refuge and he gave him abram now gave him tithes of all it's remarkable how that you see abram building altars which is a type of church you see him paying his tithe you could see these this demonstration of the christian spirit in abraham now immediately and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself in other words those that if you rescued from the kings let me have the people you keep the goods and abram said to the king of sodom and i want you to kind of catch the image here i have lift up my hand unto the lord the supreme i lift up my hand of the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth now in his immediately after he has met with the king of salem met with melchizedek and melchizedek says uh he is the priest of the most high god blessed be abram of the most high god blessed be the most high god and now when sodom confronts him and he recognizes the trick i'm not going to take anything lest you brag that i have been made rich by your hand he didn't want there to be any confusion that it's the supreme that blessed him it's the supreme that was looking out for him it was the supreme that had his back and so he lifts his hand up and it says if he's swearing i lift up my hand the lord he says the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth what has he just done he has just echoed melchizedek because mel kazakh just said bless be him he said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth he has been taught by melchizedek and he's immediately marrying and reflecting back the revelation of melchizedek and he says i am lifting my hand and i'm swearing by and i'm trusting to the supreme the possessor of heaven and earth because when you take what's taking when you look at what's taking place in this and i'm using a figurative speech but this is literally what's happening god takes abraham under his wings and mentors him to supreme faith why was it supreme faith it's the supreme god he's the supreme and he takes abraham the image i want you to catch is the faithful abraham god comes down in his greatness just takes abraham under his wings and is going to nurture him to supreme faith it says in hebrews 11 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son when he was tried tested placed under trial spoken of in a way that the purpose of determining character tests going to prove something something's going to come out of it so abraham by faith when he was tried so he had a faith that was tested and proven and then he offered up isaac so there's a faith that is built a faith that is tested and then it comes to its supreme expression and offering up isaac so abraham we have to catch this characteristic abraham himself was tried in the next chapter paul writes verse 12 chapter 12 verse 6 for whom the lord loveth he loved abraham he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth now these are words that seem very uh they're kind of aggravating someone i'm going to scourge you and chastening it it has such a a rough context to it but this is an aspect that i think that is very important that we not miss in abraham's life abraham is learning abraham is being taught abraham is being tested on what he learned abraham has been improved on what he has gained and so it says that he is to chasten it means to train to be instructed or taught to cause one to learn abraham when he was tried abraham was chasing abraham was taught he was instructed he was trained this is what's taking place when melchizedek comes down and begins to speak to abram king of salem serving him communion and he takes this communion this bread and wine and he's having his communion with melchizedek and he begins to catch the revelation of the supreme you are abram of the supreme possessor of heaven and earth so that when sodom comes to confront him in the wise feast in the presence of sodom feast at the table of melchizedek there's going to be a temptation and he says i have swore i have submitted to i am under the care of the supreme the possessor of heaven and earth he learned from melchizedek to scourge it means to whip or to plague so i'm gonna plug you i'm gonna we use maybe whip or we used to right just in case the uh child protection services is streaming in today but we there's a this chastening the scourging it speaks uh uh i mean the word literally speaks of whipping or plaguing but it's the causing uh to cause a a difficulty and in other words it to to even into it whether it be to actually chastise to to use the rod to cause use some sort of spanking corrective measure it's in order to do it in order to discipline there's a chastening which is a teaching and a training and then there's a scourging which is a discipline in order to correct not punitive to punish but remedial in order to remediate conduct to improve conduct to change behavior remember as parents our correction is to improve conduct not punish bad conduct alone well this is what god is doing in abraham he is doing this in order to improve abraham's character and so and abraham was tried he was chastened he was scourged and listen there's no doubt abraham was learning about himself in all of this i didn't know i had it in me i didn't know i could do this i didn't know i could separate from family i didn't know i could overcome this i found out i was afraid about that i found out this was going to happen i had no idea i'd be able to resist the temptation of sodom and let and let lot choose and all these great characters that are being brought of abraham but not only was he learning about himself more importantly he was learning about god that's the part i want you to get i've been preaching for almost an hour and i want to just keep emphasizing over and over again yes abraham learned a lot about himself but what was most important is that he learned about god so that the things that he learned about himself were connected not just the god of abraham but the abraham of god that he was so connected and tied to it he had this friendship with god their bosom buddies i roll with you where you go i'll go who your enemies are or my enemies who your friends are are my friends that god was wanting to teach abraham something about himself god is using abraham's life to hide a mystery of himself so really when you when you begin to look at it and examine it that god chooses abraham and as you begin to look at abraham and say well how is it he's the father of us all because god hid himself in abraham he hides his he hides the revelation of himself in the life of abraham and he wants to use abraham in the context of abraham and then we can say this is shouldn't be hard to get an amen out of this but he wants to use abraham and his seed after him to reveal his entire character and the amen is well the seed is christ and that's in whom the fullness of the godhead dwells right there in christ so it's connected to this calling of abraham the father of us all notice this language in genesis chapter 12 verses 2 and 3. by the time we're done we're all going to have these verses absolutely memorized it will haunt us all of our days just oh genesis 12 2 that's and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed this is god's covenant or promise to abraham and we look at how that this is the unconditional covenant wherein god says i will make i will bless i will make thou shalt be i will bless i will curse in thee and he's using this language and so there's a there's this god that is doing these things for abraham and making abraham something and catch this now this is going to maybe form the uh my uh with that as a foundation i'd like to preach my sermon this morning this can be the rest of the services really focused on this aspect here this is a promise to abraham but the promise to abraham reflects god's commitment to unfold who he is catch this even in the very promising covenant that he makes to abraham yes this is a promise to abraham to make abraham a great nation to bless abraham to make his name great but this is god actually saying that i'm going to reveal myself because on one hand it looks like it's only about abraham but really it's about god's desire read it and now see that what god is wanting to do and say do unto others as you would have them do unto you god is now doing something to abraham but think about how this reflects god's desire i will become a people i will be blessed my name will be great i will be a blessing and through me will i bless all the families of the earth this is actually god expressing his vision and his desire to have a great name and to become a people it's not just merely what he was going to be doing for abraham but it was what he was going to be revealing about himself through abraham so god hides himself in his dealings with abraham in order to reveal his character in genesis chapter 17 verse 5 says neither shall thy name anymore be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee he's reflecting god's plan we have to let's say god's reflected in this because remember the principle is this we're not just learning about abraham we're learning about god we're taught that if you can't see jesus christ and every verse of the bible go back and read it again there he needs to be something that we learn about the character and nature of god that's being reflected back to us so in this he says you're abram now but your name is going to be changed to abraham abram means exalted father and it comes from actually the root it comes from is the exalted one is my father so abram is a derivative of the exalted one is my father abraham being called exalted father it's a clear reference and it has this it's synonymous with god himself the exalted one that's god the exalted one as my father abram is exalted father there's this this this connection with god whereas god is the exalted father now abram is given this lesser position in this image of abram exalted father but abraham is exalted father or father of exalted father of a great multitude so in this image of of god saying your name shall not be abram but i'm going to call you abraham there had to be a meaning and a purpose behind him changing his name his exalted father seems to fit the bill because he promised him he'd become a dad but there's something about the nature and character of god that's being expressed when he changes his name because we can see that how literally god changed his name he's given him a part of himself he's inserted himself into the name of abraham so under abram he is the exalted father or the exalted one abram the exalted one is my father and and adam if you look at adam and adam god was a father but he's the father of one adam and he's he's exalted father in his relationship to abraham to abe to adam but now that's in the same image as abram he's in the same image as god would be to adam but god wants to reveal his character he's not just gonna have one son but he's gonna have many sons so he changes his name from abram which is the relationship that god had to adam exalted father and he changes abraham to abe abram to abraham which means the father of many why because god would become the father of many romans 8 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be born the firstborn among many brethren so the change of name wasn't just important to abraham but it was important to reflect that god who had one son adam is now going to have many sons from the seed of abraham this is just one example just choose one example of how god's wanting to show his nature to the life of abraham and god allows certain things in abraham's life to create tension to create conflict in order to show god's nature not just abraham's when god changes abraham's name from abram he's revealing his own name the name of god we know it hides the character of god when god has a name when he's expressed with the name it has it has something to do with the character brother said a name has something to do with its character he said a name is associated with the nature of its character and so a name is something that hides a particular life is particular power there's something to a name we taught that even to the point where we said hey be careful what you name your children because there's something in a name bill of ram says about god an unveiling of god he never changed his nature only his form so god is always the same in his nature he just changes the way that he expresses himself so even when god is given a particular name the name reveals something about his nature and his character but yet all the nature and character of god is still in the person so he says like i changed from husband when my child is born then i'm father so your husband when you're married so you're just single you're just aaron then you get married and you become husband or you can be son you get married you become husband when you have a child you become father and so what it does is it reveals character when relationship begins to change and so there's something i just kind of reviewing these things that i know you're well taught on this that there's something to the name in the name that god is when he changes abram to abraham god is revealing something about himself he's revealing his own name in abram so in genesis chapter 22 when supreme faith is expressed on mount moriah here's abraham with this declaration and he and god is made known as jehovah jireh the one who sees and provides this is this is something that on the top of this mountain this revelation comes forth and he says you are this is jehovah jobber the lord who sees and provides and it's the first explicit reference to a redemptive name of jehovah jehovah jireh we're all familiar i trust that we're all familiar with the seven redemptive names of jehovah jehovah jehovah rapha jehovah sid can you jehovah nisi jehovah shalom jehovah sharma jehovah these are the seven redemptive names of jehovah and god expresses this and this revelation on top of the mountain you're jehovah jireh this is something that's in the name brother ram says in the message jehovah jiber now abraham the promise was given to him and it's a glorious promise hear this old man and his son going up the mountain to offer up the sun a very beautiful picture of christ the whole bible pictures christ and as they went up the hill we find out that god appeared to abraham there in the name of jehovah jireh god has seven compound redemptive names those redemptive names are inseparable you can't separate one from the other so when jehovah jireh is revealed to abraham it's still jehovah nissi it's still jehovah it they're it's still the same they're inseparable so though there's maybe this dominant characteristic that comes forward that expresses something about jehovah in his redemptive name these names are inseparable but watch what brother branham also says he says abraham said in my redeemer liveth i've had the same kind of vision whereup yonder on the mountain with christ god met me and give me his redemptive names as jehovah jireh jehovah raphain and all those seeing the death burial and resurrection you'll find in different places where god brother brahm speaks about how that god was giving abraham a vision of the whole thing justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost death burial resurrection all these redemptive names he says he give me his redemptive names then in the message abraham he says in the book of genesis god gave or appeared to abraham in seven compound redemptive names the point i'd like to take from this is that abraham in abraham's life all seven redemptive names are revealed this is the character jehovah the old is jesus of the new but there's this character that's being revealed to abraham jehovah oh my shepherd what did he do he led god led him he says i'm the one that led you i shepherded you out of ur the chaldees jehovah rapha the lord is my healer what did he do he healed his body this one brother bam often refers to he healed his body he healed a dead body he healed the dead womb in genesis 14 18 melchizedek king of salem the supreme god salem was salome it's peace jehovah in my is my peace he's the king of saiyan he met him in genesis 14. as jehovah shalom genesis 15 1 i am thy shield by covering thy refuge it's jehovah nessie genesis 15 6 he said it counted to him for righteousness jehovah is my righteousness said can you here's god in these different places these these attributes of jehovah being expressed to abraham genesis 17 1 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared jehovah appeared to have made himself known allowed abram to see him and said unto him i am the almighty god i'm the el shaddai the almighty god he identifies himself as a strength giver he's identifying himself this is a characteristic of god i'm the one who nourishes this is something intimate i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect jehovah shama the lord is present with me i'm el shaddai but walk before me i'm present every single redemptive name is being revealed to abraham the character of god is being expressed to abraham jehovah jehovah nessie jehovah rapha jehovah shalom jehovah shaman jehovah said can you all these these uh jehovah jireh the most the beginning of these things that the name comes forth in chapter 22 this is god making himself known to abraham because the story of abraham reveals to us more about the character of god than it does about abraham in exodus 6 3 and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them this is a pretty interesting scripture isn't it very profound there's many that wrestle with this and it creates maybe certain problems and and paradoxes that men try to wrestle with and figure out that perhaps it's moses that goes in later and puts lord god into these key phrases to describe the one that was doing these things so it's backwards looking seeing this jehovah but we see that it's abram who's the almighty god makes himself known it's he calls upon the name of the lord there's this relationship that begins to develop and when you see this when god says i appeared unto abraham isaac and jacob by the name god almighty el shaddai i appeared unto them he says but by my name jehovah was i not known to them he's saying in this character i made a covenant with abraham in this character and in this representation i made him promises and i'm just going to look at this very narrow way that we can look at this scripture but those promises did not just pertain to abraham isaac and jacob but it pertained to future generations so they were not fully revealed and fulfilled to your fathers alone but he's saying but now as jehovah the same almighty god that appeared to abraham the same lord god that was revealed to abraham i will bring into existence all those things i said i would do to abraham abraham did not walk fully in the promise abraham did not receive everything that i spoke of him but when i came to him i told him that his seed would sojourn in a strange land for 400 years and i would bring them out and they would come back to this land he's saying now i'm going to appear to you even in a way that is greater than even abraham would have experienced it greater than what isaac experienced greater than what jacob experienced i now as jehovah will fulfill the promise that i made to abraham and whatever character i was expressing to abraham it'll be made perfect in the way that i express myself to you and you begin to recognize what he's saying to israel you realize he's speaking something to us as the royal seed of abraham whatever these redemptive names meant to abraham whatever these redemptive names meant to israel whatever these redemptive names have meant to the church through jesus christ it is through christ that in this end time he is going to reveal himself as jehovah and fulfill the promise he made to abraham's seed because this revelation of god to abraham was a revelation of jehovah and these seven redemptive names they're expressed can you see it in the life of abraham all these aspects and characteristics of god are being revealed not just abraham's character as i said earlier abraham was learning about himself but more important he was learning about god god had to this is something i've pondered through these several weeks god had to enter into a relationship with abraham in order to reveal his character we see god at on a particular level we can see him in this very intimate setting in the garden but that's lost and whatever that was is broken and man is is barred from it so in genesis 4 on through these seven chapters to chapter 11 we see god with this unique relationship with mankind and it's really just one particular view of god and if that if that view of god ever is going to change god's going to have to be build a relationship again with man so god had to enter into relationship with man in order to reveal himself he's not just a god that he wants us to be afraid of we need to respect him and reverence him but it has to be because of his character it has to be something about him that we know he that believeth he that cometh god must believe that he is and he's a rewarder there has to be some understanding of his nature and his character so god had to establish relationship in order to build trust based upon truth in the church age book god being a savior it was necessary that he predestinated a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being this was necessary that god predestined a man that would require salvation we could even say this abram was that man he's in the fire of babylon he is that man that needs salvation so when god begins to establish relationship with abram it's not so much about the god of abraham as much as the abraham of the most high god this is something where both are being expressed to say something about god's character so he says thus what god worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god satan brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god god it would required a man that needed salvation to give god purpose and reason of being remember exactly almost exactly a year ago i believe that we were expressing in the beginning when mankind fell and that had mankind never left the garden we would have never known who god was i mean yeah you could have this all everything's perfect but there's so many things more about god adam's never sick but god's a healer you'll never know it adam never gets in trouble but god's a deliverer and you'll never know it there's so much more to god that he wanted to express and he wanted to make known so it required this fall and so when we see that it says there had to be salvation had to be required a man needed to be saved in order to god have to reason and purpose of being and the fall worked out that which was necessary for the purpose of god when adam fell when god began to make the last adam who did he begin with abraham and he's the beginning of faith as i close so then abraham's testings and i would want to just look at the the story and life of abraham and you have to just do this on your own and make connection to the whether the barrenness or the wars and the strife and everything that he went through abraham's testings his trials his conditions of his body his wife's body the circumstances he found himself in these are not just things that abraham got himself into and and character development for abraham but it was opportunities for god it was an opportunity for god to make himself known in john chapter 9 verses 1 to 3 and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and the disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind intriguing question considering the man was blind from birth but he says who did send this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him could you take this as a comfort for you today so often we sit back trying to figure out that whether or not what i'm suffering today is because i sinned because i did this and because i did that you know regardless of whether or not you sinned or your parents sinned or somebody else's sin it's an opportunity for the works of god to be made manifest to you and whereas it could have been a perfectly wonderful opportunity to chastise somebody call out somebody's sin point out somebody's mistakes god jesus says it's not for that purpose but for that that the works of god should be made manifest in him so abraham's testimony whether it relates to struggles or trials or disappointments it was for the purpose of manifesting the work of god that when we look at abraham we're not just seeing faithful abraham we have to recognize the headship of a faithful god he was under that and that's what made him faithful and god realized i have to emphasize this very quickly in closing it was not just enough to tell them it wasn't enough for abraham just to hear hear the story or to hear somebody else's story well i'm going to have abraham born 50 years earlier and he's going to sit at the feet of noah and noah's going to tell him all these things about about god he's going to he's going to hear it from shem just to tell him would not be enough so in abraham it's not just merely telling him and him hearing but he wanted him to experience it abraham was not just going to be one who would say well i was told of this god that did that and i was told this god that did that and god told me he would do this and god told me to do that but he'd be a god that he could experience god placed a strong arm around him and he brought him to supreme faith remember what how we go from faith to supreme faith daily acts of faith the routine this is what was happening in abraham's life daily experiences of god's nature his character through trial and victory he was learning about god and so his experiences took what he knew about god and it became it became deeper became richer because that's what god desired to do is to not merely just have a story about him but for mankind to experience him in the message of paradox brother mike if you could just make ready to come if you want to if you come if the lord put something on your heart to play just take that liberty just have a few scriptures i want to read in in closing um but this quote was the last statement i'd like to read he says the trouble of it is today the churches speak look like say what did moody say what did sankey say think about that speak and say what god said let's go forward not look back go this away it's hard on these turning corners brother brahms here in the message paradox he's causing his church to turn from laodicea pentecost wanting to turn the corner he said it's hard on turning these corners church don't want to believe that you see they're always referring back from where their educational standpoint because that's a school in itself they learn that through book learning we know that through experience of trusting god and knowing that he does that he does do this we should not merely just know through book experience or tape experience from hearing it on book and hear it on tape our our religion if you want to put it that way our faith should not just be well what did brother branham say but it has to be more than that i think this is relevant today that god wants his word he wants you to experience his word what his word said he wants you to experience it because you're learning about the character nature of god daily acts of faith where it just be the supernatural becomes so routine you can just trust him and move up to a higher level that's when you believe his word and then you experience his word this is what's expressed in abraham he said abraham i'm going to do this to you and then god gave abraham experiences that developed this faith and this trust the product of abraham's faith was the product of god nurturing him el shaddai is a product of god encouraging him don't be afraid abram a process of god molding him teaching him training him and abraham listening to him and he becomes abram the wanderer right the wandering syrian the hebrew and he becomes faithful abraham and in the seed of abraham it speaks of isaac and it says in genesis 26 24 and the lord appeared unto him the lord appeared unto isaac the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee see isaac could have lived with a relationship with god that was he appeared to my dad and he said to my dad don't be afraid so i am going to believe in the god who revealed himself to my dad and told him not to be afraid and by my dad's testimony i'm not going to be afraid and that was wonderful but god didn't want to leave isaac in the second hand condition where he's merely just believing in the god that revealed himself to his dad but he gives isaac the exact same experience and the same god appears to him and he says i am the god of abraham thy father and he says fear not just as he had said to his father he says for i am with thee jehovah's shema the lord is my prayer i am in the lord's presence i will bless thee and multiply thy seed from my servant abraham's sake so not only is he the god of abraham because he revealed himself to abraham he became the god of abraham he becomes the god of whomever he reveals himself to but now he's the god of isaac because he's made himself known to isaac but then isaac's going to have an heir and it's not going to be esau but it's going to be jacob so the two chapters later it says and behold chapter 28 verse 13 and behold the lord stood above it and said speak in the sound of jacob i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land where on thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and when jacob rehearses this to joseph he says god almighty appeared unto me god almighty the same one that appeared to abraham same one that appeared to isaac jacob could have been the one that says well he didn't just appear to my daddy but he appeared to my grandpa he appeared to abraham he appeared to isaac and he believed in the god that made himself known to abraham he believed in the god that made himself known to isaac and jacob would have had every reason to believe based upon their testimony and witness that what god told them would happen it was happening he could see the blessing he could believe the report he could have confidence in him but god was not happy just allowing jacob to go by the report of abraham and isaac he wanted to give him a similar experience so he also appears and the lord almighty appeared unto jacob and what does he do for him he changes his name too because jacob wasn't enough to describe the character that was being developed in him you were a deceiver you were a hill grabber but now you are a prince with god and then when god comes down to fulfill genesis 15 that your people will be in a strange land for 400 years this revelation given to abraham when he comes down he says in exodus 3 6 i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob that remarkable god's not afraid to identify himself with these men i am the god of abraham because i revealed myself to him i am the god of isaac because i revealed myself to him i am the god of jacob because i revealed myself to him and what i did for my fathers i'm going to do for you why because when i was telling their story the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob when their stories when their testimonies when their experience and their history was being told it wasn't just history but it was his story god was declaring and revealing something about himself so he said the god of abraham he doesn't want you to think about abraham he wants you to think about the god when he says the god of isaac he doesn't want you to think about isaac he wants you to think about god when he says the god of jacob he doesn't want you to think about jacob he wants you to think about the god it's god that's revealing himself and that's the same god that's been revealed to us today we're not worshiping the god of a man we have been brought into fellowship with the god and to think that his story is my story and what he speaks to us and what we ought to take great comfort in is what was betrayed portrayed and revealed in the character of abraham the life of abraham he is revealing to us i will take you out of the fire i will keep you in bareness i will rescue you from family strife i will protect you when things get difficult i will preserve you in famine i will i will do these things for you we are not in the basis of adam we are not in the basis of cain we are not in the basis of noah we are not on the basis of nimrod we are not on the basis of lot we are not on the basis of ishmael we are on the same basis that abraham was placed with god so i express it in this way this has been an underlying burden upon my heart let's learn to trust him oh to absolutely trust him there's a song tis so sweet to trust in jesus that ought to be a refrain that we just anchor in our hearts that we recognize that what i'm going through today if we could just turn everything around invert always invert you look back on your past terrible hurtful awful things things we're ashamed of things that brought us to our brought us to our very end we despaired of life through all of it god is wanting to teach us to trust in every single instance god is teaching us in those things to trust and he said oh no here i come again here it comes again he's giving you an opportunity to demonstrate trustworthiness he's given you an opportunity to demonstrate faithfulness if i could say this way in those situations what did he prove himself to be faithful so god was proving you could trust him then when we come into another trial it's just god given us an opportunity to trust [Music] after the victory in the battle of the kings melchizedek served in bread and wine and it's it's it seems after the battle after the conflict the type of the marriage supper the wedding supper in the sky here comes the king of sodom testing abraham and he had learned to trust and he said i lift my hand to the supreme and whose wing i've come to trust could we stand together today [Music] with our heads bowed i'd like to pray with you i pray for you is any particular need that you may have on your heart if you could examine it through the context of what we've talked about today [Music] and how in everything that abraham went through abraham survives as faithful abraham [Music] but it was the product of serving a faithful god so whatever it is you're going through today if you could ask god to help you to relate to it in the context of him making himself known to you what you can learn about him what he's trying to show you about himself then you'll learn to trust him our gracious heavenly father today as we close our service our minds and our thoughts are completely upon you lord and it's sentiments that were expressed in this service lord even as i call back for people to remember what they've been through what they've gone through what they've suffered what they've experienced it is it is moments like this that we begin to ponder these things and wrestle with them [Music] and it is those times lord when we want to know that it was you [Music] and to not only know that it was you but to see what part of you what redemptive name what characteristic what attribute was being expressed to us what is it you wanted me to learn what is it that i need to take away from this [Music] as we're confronted with challenges as we're faced with decisions we want to feel your presence lord and this would be my prayer for everyone that is here today may we have an experience with you lord [Music] according to your word we're not asking father that we just have an experience and that we make experience our measuring stick but lord we want to have an experience according to what you've promised now lord that that applies to every promise you have made us there are those who are hearing this sermon right now who believe you are a healer and who need to experience you as a healer there are those who've experienced you very near in life and leading them and guiding them and perhaps they've experienced a confession of justification and some measure of sanctification but lord what they really need is a genuine experience of the new birth where their soul and you lock together and they become new creatures in christ jesus lord with abraham you gave him your word but it was not just a story but you gave him an experience with you an experience with your word that would be my prayer for us as the royal seat of abraham that we likewise could experience your presence experience your word [Music] lord i pray that this would be the thought that could be sealed in our hearts that the story of abraham is revealing to us your character and your nature lord we want to know more about you we want to learn more about you we commit the people to you today pray that you bless their hearts and encourage them and strengthen them in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music]
