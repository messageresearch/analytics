TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title this morning is the simple life and we're taking it from we're still continuing on the subject of the house of the Lord I was going back to some of the earlier sermons we preached on this and just revisiting some of the themes that we've had in this and so this theme of Simplicity and uh The Simple Life of Christ may be one way of putting it but we want to uh explore this idea of the simple life and a few weeks ago when we were visiting my grandma in San Diego my wife was speaking with her and maybe have maybe asked a question and her answer was striking especially at the time with the things I was studying and ministering on uh she made this statement just live an ordinary life some people try to jump too high just be ordinary and it struck me in the telling of it at the moment as we were had just spent some time with her and we thought maybe this may be the last time we've seen her but apparently my kids just enthused with so much energy she's doing great now and uh and so we're very ha happy for that and grateful for that but she was trying to convey and she may have she said some other things around it that conveyed that you know some people in life are so worried about reaching so high and becoming something uh that they don't ever just really live an ordinary life and do their ordinary things and and to be ordinary it's something that is just regular or customary and we know that a garnet Peak brother brandham said he was more than just an ordinary teenager of passing through and I don't believe that brother brandham was saying that he was extraordinary in life where everybody was like oh man this guy g a peak man people looked at him he's like well he's he's sick he's a uh he's an invalid he's and but brother brandom identified that he was more than just an ordinary teenager who are looking at life a certain way and doing something a certain way so when we use the term ordinary we're not just talking about common in the world but something that is customary or in a usual order or something that is after a certain course and it's just the ordinary way that something is done and and I think that that was what she was tapping into is this idea of just live simply don't try to reach to high but just live simply and so I'll say this at the outset so that you're you're ready for you know where I'm going with this but the simple life let me put it this way the life that Taps into the mystery of Christ is a simple life the one that can get to the real deepness of the mysteries of Christ a life that Taps into the mystery of Christ and when I say mystery it's that which is customary or the usual course or order of Christ and uh that's the that's the life that is a simple life Christ is outside of the ordinary course of religion he's outside the ordinary course of of nominal Christianity but there is something that customary of Christ something that you would expect of Christ something that's usual of Christ and so I'm looking at this in the sense of the simple life and I I'll say a humble life is the deeper life sometimes we think people oh the deeper things the Deeper Life and we want to get deeper we want to get more Revelation and we call upon God for Revelation and we think that the deeper that we go in Christ like the the higher our understanding is to man and the more that we could figure things out and and be impressive and other people would rely upon us but TR the deeper we get the more grounded we get the more stable we get and in some ways the more ordinary we're going to be when it comes to the things of God and where it comes to Living the Life of Christ and not just trying to be a religious fanatic I'll say this I maybe I'm I'm tracking this in my mind over and over again because there's always this this side where people will recognize uh that you are a Christian but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll be happy with that you know there's times that you behave appropriately you're humble you're Meek you demure you say I'm sorry you try not to engage and escalate the situation and it makes the world mad he like I was wanting to fight I I thought that if I could lock horns with you you would say or do something that would make me feel Justified for my anger and my bitterness but you've just diffused the whole situation and quite frankly you've made it worse for me so it's not that the world's always going to be like you're Christ I love it no that's not the case but it's what Christ Christ would do and it may not be extraordinary in the eyes of the world and it may not be the real religious Thunder that we would like to have in our own lives but yet it is just it is just what Christ would do and so we're trying we want to live that Deeper Life which is the humble life I'll say this now as a cue to those who would like to do so or those who usually do this but I've really been uh just grabbed my attention has been grabbed by the sermon Harvest Time and brother bradam will'll take a text in there as we get to a c u we get to a scripture reading later brother bam took it as a text in that sermon and I've just been it's I've been hearing it it seems it feels as if for the first time it's just so amazing now in Daniel 12: 1 to4 since we're talking about a life that Taps into the mystery of Christ and kind of that Deeper Life is a humble life I I want to look at it in the context of the time that we're living in now because we don't ever want to go backwards and and say well the simple life let's just go back to the the days of the Little House on the prayer and let's just go back to living uh without technology or living without this and living without that and so there's a way that we could be trying to go back to a simpler time and we're not actually tracking the word of God to e to the to Israel when they were in The Exodus there was a point at which they felt that the life in the wilderness was way too complicated and they would rather go back to Egypt because it was just simpler was just you know we got told what to do we knew where we were living we knew what we were eating and we don't want to have that kind of attitude well well we just we want to go back to some archaic way of living we want to know the promise of God for today and not go backwards and so in Daniel chapter 12 and especially as I've been studying Harvest Time this scripture is just right in this vein and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book what great meaning uh names written in a book an unfolding a revealing an opening of a book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt so we see that it's speaking about end time things a time when books will be open and people will be judged a time of even a resurrection of those who will awake to everlasting life and then a period of time where there's even those uh that will wake up to Everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the Stars forever and ever they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book what an image what a striking image for us even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased this phrase many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased is one that's uh interesting to really wrestle with and even the translations or even the original language in terms of uh traveling and moving on and gaining knowledge and experience there a there's a lot to be uh impressed with that but it's the scripture is connected with the end times and the increase of human wisdom the increase of Science and knowledge where uh the the globe is understood now and I was even reading an article or saw a headline of an article where the world's economy may need to shrink we may need to shrink our economies because it's becoming uh a detriment to have a global economy h a book that really uh kind of uncovered and put into context a lot of what's happened in the world today it's a book I think it's by fredman called The World is Flat has anybody read that book The World is Flat it's it's huge so oh you did read it okay you probably listen to it right yeah you listen to it that's cheating it's all I do really anymore is listen to books though a and it's this idea that because of the technology we have uh we could be communicating right now somebody on the other side of the earth could be listening to this service right now live and they know exactly what has been preached and it doesn't have to travel by letter through the sea and so it's just the world has been flattened and everyone's connected and news it meets us immediately and everything is unfolding in real time and that's the time that we're living in many shall run to and fro we've circumnavigated the globe everyone is everywhere connected all the time and there's been this increase of knowledge and as we have been ministering on for the last couple months this increase of knowledge has led to the increase of the possession of things but we've never achieved an understanding of things a true understanding of things or pure understanding or achieved understanding that Daniel is writing here uh that uh that we would desire that we think we should have so we've had the pursuit of knowledge and gaining knowledge we've got the possession of things but yet there is no understanding if anything we've reached kind of a real interesting time in technology and the evolution of science and knowledge to where in some ways we're just kind of putting out the same thing over and over again but just trying to tweak it so that people think they're buying something new so it's there's not a lot of new things to be envisioned we're we're just nearing that end of the cycle brother Bram in this day this scripture is fulfilled I was reading every instance that I could find where brother bradam is referring to this uh Daniel chapter 12 but this was a I'm really good to kind of sum it all up here in 65 politics is rotten corrupted rotten to the bottom just exactly what Matthew 24 said it would be Nation would be against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom all these things would take place so there's this politics are rotten this is a good script should read during an election year politics are rotten rotten to the bottom Nation against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there's so much division let's consider this now all right notice another the increase in scientific research my grandfather went to see my grandmother in an ox Ox cart now it's a jet plane or even an orbit into outer space he says it's great who said this Daniel 12:4 said knowledge shall increase in the last days so he says we see the hour that we're living in we're living in this hour where this Daniel was told shut up uh the words and seal the book until the end the time when knowledge has increased the scientific Age and and man has given himself over to himself to trust in himself and his data collection and his data analysis and he's let loose his faith in God and went from the ox cart to a space shuttle in a short period of time he's saying that's that's the time that we're living in we see the hour we're living in notice now the conditions of the world the condition of Science and notice again today in our educational system so there's a lot that we could ident ify in terms of knowledge science and education and the uh the advancement of humanity through these different things whether it be uh uh Science Education uh and these different things Transportation these things that brother Brown's referring to I I I want to summarize this so I can keep going further we are living in the day of Daniel 12 H we're living in the day that many of them that sleep shall awake we're living in a time when the words of the book are are are are opened up and unsealed we're living in a time when they that be wise shall be shall shine as the brightness of the firmament so if you look at that scripture there in verse three they that be wise it's those that will understand the word they will their lives will radiate with the gospel in a time when people are running to and fro and gaining knowledge and knowledge is increased and there's a lot of advancements and a lot of technology and there's a lot of living and and the World is Flat though that will understand the word their life will shine as in darkness there's going to be a customary way of the world there's going to be things that are expected of the world there's going to be a life that's lived by the world but there's going to be those that are shining and even though it's just a common life it's just like the common star you see in the sky every night it's light in darkness the life they live by the understanding of the word now it says they that be wise will shine as the brightness of the firmament and they'll turn they'll be the same that turn many to righteousness so it's the life that they live by the understanding of the word that leads others to Christ and this is I'm not tossing off on books and blogs and and videos and and uh explanations and expository teaching I think that's all wonderful and there's a lot of effort that's put out there in social media uh there's even some who in Europe that have had significant success utilizing Facebook to spread the message uh and it gained a lot of souls but then it kind of reached a point to where there's a law of diminishing returns and it was no longer viable and I believe in some ways we're reaching that time where it is in fact gleaning and the most effective witness of the Gospel is not going to be uh uh uh YouTube shorts or or new books or blogs or even tweets the real effectiveness of the Gospel is going to be in the lives that people are living before those they come and cont cont with and again let me be very very clear I have nothing in general against any of those things I do have a little bit of a a sensitivity against some people have a gluten sensitivity it's not an allergy it's just a Sensitivity I do have some sensitivity when it comes to apologetics we feel like we need to explain everything and make everything sound just right well sometimes I think it's good when there's rough edges and it's not explainable because that's just the way my God is now it is going to be the life that they live that turns others to Christ and then in verse 9 of Daniel 12 it says and he said go thy Way Daniel and again it's kind of summing these things up for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end now with this idea of this book being sealed until this time when these things are going to be in a specific time in history of mankind that these things will unfold it says many shall be purified and may white and tried there's going to be a group that is Tried by the word and stands White and purified there's going to be those who are judged on Earth by Jesus Christ and they renounce any hidden things of darkness and their lives are made pure and they're made white there's going to be many that are purified made white and tried but it says but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand so there's going to be the unrighteous that continue to do unrighteousness and there's going to be the wicked that continue to do wickedly and he says they're not going to have understanding and it's the lack of understanding that explains why they're lost it's the lack of understanding that explains why they continue to do wickedly and they continue to do unrighteous things but the wise shall understand the wise shall understand the words of the book that have been sealed up to the end time the wise shall understand uh the mind of God and the things of God the wise shall understand and it's through the understanding that they're purified made white and tried it's through their understanding that they shine as the brightness of the firmament and turn many others to righteousness in Revelations 10: 10 and 11 we understand the sequence of events from Revelations 5 in the opening of the book to Revelations 10:1 and the book and the contents of that book being revealed and brought back down to earth John in the scripture is challenged to go to him who has the open book which is Christ This Book of redemption and to take it and so he says I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up because he was commanded by the angel to eat it and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings if I could just summarize it this way without getting into a lot of details the life or this this this mystery that was hidden in this book which now John symbolically has taken and eaten that mystery is to be lived out before many to be somehow processed in your life and then demonstrated in manifested before many as it was in Revelations 5 to Every Creature H and there's going to be a blessing and honor and glory and power that's going to be radiated out of that's going to be lived out of and expressed by in in this type of John how he takes the book and he's told you're going to prophesy again to many peoples Nations tongues and Kings I could say in type the bride is processing the word of God the body of Christ is the bearer of his glory his honor and his power and as she lives her life the mystery is lived out before many peoples Nations tongues and kings around the world as many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased there's going to be wisdom and understanding likewise that's going to be lived out in the life of the Believers around the world those that receive the word become the word and then they live a life by the word so that it's prophesying again now if we could again this may seem like kind of a little bit of a leap but I'm I'm now just I'm not sure when we read a lot of these statements and we built a lot more into it but there was a sermon within the last a couple years we we read a lot of this and we tracked a similar thought and as it was meditating on it even this morning I realized that this may be something that you just you need to revisit on a regular interval so that we don't lose sight of this commandment and I I want to put it in that sense this end time commandment this emphasis as we read Daniel chapter 12 the book is sealed and the words are going to be open in the end time and the wise are going to understand but the wicked won't understand and that many will be made purified it will be purified and made white and tried but the wicked will continue to do wickedly and thou must prophesy again and there's a way that you begin to paint this picture where that it's so Grand and great in our eyes and you got the white and you have the wicked and you got to be very careful with those terminologies but you have those that are made white and purified and tried and they're going to be the holy ones and they're the righteous ones and they're the ones that understand but then you have the wicked ones that are continue to do wickedly and there this this Chasm that begins to develop in our minds and we see it it's so vast and so different these callings and these positions and these elections and even the Fulfillment of these scriptures shine is the brightness of the stars turn many to righteousness a and these words being opened up in the end time and the book coming down and a mighty Angel and there's a lot of things that we begin to read but I want you to catch the emphasis that was given to us at the time that the word was opened and how important it is to recognize this is still part of the mystery because of its Simplicity brother brandom on March 24th 1963 he takes time to give question and answers on the seals after he has preached uh God hiding himself in Simplicity the breach and the first six before he preaches the seventh seal that evening he takes question and answers and I'm only cutting these out and I know I'm cutting them out of context but the statements to me don't lose their meaning by uh when you remove it from this question that's being asked and maybe the subsequent statements but he says you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a Christian Life go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for Christ and tell the people how you love him so there's going to be many that are purified made white and tried those are the wise that understand and the wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament that's fire so he says go ahead and live a Christian Life go to your church be a real light and just burn this ISS exactly Daniel 12 he says tell the people how you love and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people cuz if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and then you're off the Beaten Track that if we don't are have love all the time with the people if we're not lifting up how much we love him if we're not going to church if we're not a real light and we're not burning for Christ and we're not living a Christian Life you've somehow gotten yourself into an area now he he's not necessarily cautioning against I'm back sliding and and turning uh the message becoming a drug cult or sex cult or something really crazy H H and you say well where are you going with that well you know what there's a lot of people that have been associated with the message that have done awful perverted things and horrible things in the name of the message and it still continues under the guise of the message to this day a and and I would argue that the same has been done in the name of the Bible to the same if not worse degrees but there's he's referring to this idea that we could take the thing that are being said and done and get weird with it leave the weirdness to Portland and Austin right like there's an idea where that we don't we don't want to get weird with it we want to listen to what is being said catch the true understanding of it instead of trying to jump too high and and and live in a way that is weird before the people and distant and distinct we want to live stay grounded and Live the Life of Christ otherwise you're getting off the track the beaten path that has been demonstrated for us the example that's been provided he says remember what I preached on and I believe he's hearkening back to the beginning of the week humility don't forget that he says I'm going to stop a minute to warn that again all this is in question answers on the seals remember when God predicts anything great to happen the people are looking so far away by their wisdom till they miss what happens he mentions that old over and over and over again even about John the Baptist uh how they expected him to be a certain way and even how John the Baptist he said it was so simple to even the prophet missed it I don't think I'm reading that one but he says that about how John the Baptist missed the Simplicity of Christ because he expected the Messiah to be in a particular way and even John the Baptist was not uh didn't catch it at first he said they didn't understand it even the disciples didn't get it and it's by our wisdom by our knowledge by the increase he says that by their wisdom they miss it they looking so far away we're looking up and he said you're looking over it right you're looking for something great something big they don't understand it even the disciples didn't get it Simplicity be humble go right down when God promises something big it is big in his sight the blade of grass has life in it it's so simple and humble the blade of grass is big in God's eyes but yet simple and humble in our eyes we've been able to uh produce a synthetic grass that's better than real grass it may get 180 degrees on days like Friday but it's simple the blade of grass is humble it's simple it's humble you see a man is a big man all right but if he's big enough that he can become simple he'll find God you find God in that Simplicity big enough to become simple he'll find God but if he don't become simple he'll never see him so you've got to become simple now there is a simple in the Old Testament which is foolish so there is a there is a simple that brother bam is not alluding to but he's he's the way that he's saying is this way of trying to make things extravagant and make things complicated and and complex and make things big and showy he's saiding no you've got to be simple like Christ you've got to be humble like Christ if you don't you're going to get away from it you're going to miss it so he says get humble just stay humble just go on he says and live a good Christian life now I'm not repeating this is his his emphasis I'm not rereading something I've already read this is Brother brandham continuing with this repetition in question and answers the morning before he preaches the seventh seal he says just go on and live a good Christian life because you only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it if you don't live a Christian Life if you don't stay humble you'll wind yourself away from the real thing so there is something genuine there is something real but it's not found in and uh in not living the Christian Life it's not going to be manifested or expressed outside of being a Christian he says well just be real humble again these are just statements I'm pulling from it not just one quote you just be real humble be a Christian and try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you he saids don't try to make any and it is a fragment but we could maybe just let the Lord fill in our heart what he might have said if we're going to be honest and love those that don't love us you see you do you only make it a mysterious something and mess the real program of God up you'll mess the real program of God up now God has a program and we want to get right in it God God has a way God has something he's trying to do brother bam calls it a beaten path he calls it the real thing there's different ways if we try to get mysterious making a mysterious something you mess the real program up now I want to just throw this out there I think it might be worth a really long series maybe 2025 can be on this but there is the idea of a mystery and a mystery is something that's not understood or known and so a revelation is the revealing of the mystery a revelation kind of unfolds or exposes what the mystery was all about yet we understand that even if a mystery scripturally is revealed and so there's a revealing of the mystery there can still be a mysterious element that remains and it can also be that not everyone understands the mystery's been revealed and so I'm not trying to uh I I don't necessarily want to open up something that causes a lot of a thought and you get kind of lost in my thought today but in the thinking of the mystery versus the revealing and if there's going to be many that are wise and they shall understand they're going to understand the my hisory of God there's going to be something in the simp the the the God they're going to find God in simplicity so there's going to be a man no matter how big or how great we are we become humble we become simple and we find God and in finding God he's saying just live a Christian Life and so this is the part I want to express that if there's the mystery and then there's the revealing there's nothing more telling than a person's life there's nothing more telling there's nothing more revealing in than how someone lives we can talk a talk we can pretense pretense but examine a man's life and there's something telling about a way a man lives and I don't mean just in the moment when he's angry or upset or when he stubs his toe and he throws something or he gets caught off guard I'm not look at the man's life not judging him in a moment but as he lives his life even you could say someone I've never met a man that makes more mistakes but as that man lives you might find I've never met a man who handles mistakes better and humbles himself better than that person he was I've never met a man who's learned more from his mistakes I've never met a man more perfect and and you ask man you're perfect bro you're amazing it's like I've made a lot of mistakes I've just learned from all my mistakes you're like man this guy won't take credit for anything and so it's just something where he's learned he's grown he's lived and and you look at there's nothing more revealing than a person's life right I'm not I never mind I hope you I hope you understand what I'm saying if you don't agree challenge me to become be uh do better to get myself out of the way and study and find the inspiration of God to make those things clear now he arrives at this spot in question and answers to me that just open it up so much in sum up what he's been saying and he uses some references that we may we like we're maybe all thinking what nobody does this anymore but he says if you're planting wheat plant your wheat he says if you're digging potatoes go on and dig them out I don't know if you plant wheat at the same time you're digging out potatoes but I'm sure there's a lot there that someone could look into and find some sort of cycle of things but if you're planting wheat plant it plant the wheat oh some great big mysterious things happened H HH this is amazing and let's all just let's all just move to presc it and start a camp or let's do this let's do that let's let's all get together and do something and withdraw ourselves and any moment now we just could keep your eyes on brother brandom follow brother brandom because if he goes we want to go with him and if he and if he goes we want his Mantle when he leaves and and he's saying listen if you got wheat to plant don't just follow me around and stalk me go plant your wheat if got to crop the Harvest go Harvest it you got to dig out some potatoes dig out some potatoes he says if I knew he was coming tomorrow and I was a farmer I'd put my crop in today if he made me a farmer I'm going to stay right at my duty now take that if you made me a farmer that's really specific uh to a particular occupation and we can make a lot of assumptions based upon that that title of farmer but now put yourself in this if he made you a if he made you a husband and a father and a mechanic or a coder keep doing your duty be right at your duty do not use the message of the hour as an excuse to Sher your duty do not use being spiritual and studying Revelation as an excuse to not be a good husband to not provide for your family there are men who have used this excuse of being spiritual and being gifted and being prophets to just lay waste to their children and their wives and some of them do have wives plural but he says just keep doing what your duty is he says if I'm hoing potatoes I'll just be hoing away just as hard as I I can now let's we're not going to feel left out if we're not a wheat farmer we're not going man well I'm not even a potato farmer and and we're not like leaving today really really jealous of the brother in the church who's both both a wheat farmer and a potato farmer all somebody who's both Ukrainian and Irish or something were like man this guy won the lottery when it comes to the message because he's farming wheat and digging potatoes and we think he's the most spiritual whatever you are whatever your duty is keep doing it dig the potatoes and go to church where's the camera I always for dig the potatoes and go to church if I'm hoing potatoes I'll just be hoing away just as hard as I can dig the potatoes and go to church and write on if it takes place in the morning you'd be found doing just exactly what you are supposed to be doing this is remarkable in the sense that if we all knew right now that Jesus Christ was going to come tomorrow morning at 10:30 in that vacular that language of this idea that at 10:30 everything's going to be over and then it's like well I'm not going to go to bed I'm G to stay up all night I'm going to finish reading the Earth is flat I want there's this idea that this is what I'm going to do you wouldn't go to work would you send your kids to school yeah I mean thank someone's listening that's what he's telling us we should do that if we knew that at 10:30 the next day that that there was going to be a translation to change and many that sleep are going to be raised and we that are alive and remain are going to be changing a moment in twink of VI don't be afraid to send your kid to school you're going to see them just beyond the veil Don't Be Afraid just to keep doing what you're doing and all don't let fear dictate what you do and don't let Faith make you weird and cultish and not do what a normal person would do wake up in the morning go through your routine make your Lion's man tea and and eat your Crispy Cream donut with it and just do your routine he says just keep doing what you're supposed to be doing he says don't start and I love it it's a fragment don't start in other words whatever you were just thinking nuh no don't don't start whatever it is you would do nuh don't start he doesn't say don't start you know binging Netflix he doesn't say anything but no no no no no whatever you were thinking don't start when you do you twist the very thing away from the purpose that it's intended for now if I could put it this way and if you feel that I'm Taking Liberties I understand because I'm I'm trying just to summarize this if he's talking about the Lord coming I want to read it just exactly if it takes place in the morning and the things if it's this change this Rapture whatever we're thinking this fin final event that's up going to upset everything and turn everything around said if it's to take place in the morning you keep doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing so whatever he's referring to that's to take place has a purpose that it's intended for and if you don't just keep doing what you're supposed to do and live the Christian life then you defeat the purpose for what this was intended for and tell me if this Prophet isn't being very delicate but yet able to hit the mark exactly saying these things that are transpiring are not supposed to lift you out into a Mountaintop somewhere where you're isolated from everybody else not to keep you from doing what other normal people would do it's not to make you arrogant it's not to make you proud it's not to make you indifferent but it's to get you to a place where you live a good Christian Life you uh you go to church you're real light wherever you are you're burning for Christ you love the people you do good to those who don't do good to you you love those who hate you and you're planting your potatoes and you're harvesting your wheat you're doing whatever it is you're supposed to do because if you don't what this is is intended to make you do that and if you don't you've twisted your way from the very thing it's for it's for you twist yourself away from the very purpose that it's intended for so brother brandham in the seventh seal he says remember Revelations 10:1 to7 at the end the seventh Angel's mystery all the mysteries of God would be made known we're at the end time the open of the Seath seal how did I know the other day last week a Sunday ago when I was preaching on be humble be humble remember God deals in the little things now the placing of these two things next to each other is amazing Revelations 10:1 the open of the seventh seal Revelations eight and Revelations 5 all these things that kind of collide together and he says remember a week ago be humble be humble remember God deals in little things I didn't realize what it was really talking about and now I see it it is in such a humble way you think that something like that would be revealed to the Vatican or it just comes like John the Baptist it he says but it comes just like John the Baptist it comes like the birth of our Lord in a stable glory to God so help me the hour is at hand we are here we are here we've arrived at the unfolding and The Happening of these things but it's not big like men thinks it's going to be big it's going to be big like God thinks it's going to be big a blade of grass that's got life in it simple humble in the little things like John the Baptist or a baby laying in a Manger so he says now as he's gone on and he's kind of gotten into some areas that maybe he's he feels later on that he's venturing too far but as he preaches this he says there's no great men among us we're not great men not great women we're all brothers and sisters all the the same in the same bracket we're not great one don't make one greater than the other not a thing at all to do to do remember that without prejudice but we're just all human beings don't try to interpret the things don't try to interpret this to make brother Bram God don't try to interpret it to where we have modern day Elohim don't try to interpret it to where we have modern day eth Messengers he says don't try to do anything more than just live a close Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus Christ Christ everybody understand that now amen love him with all your heart what what an incredible conclusion to arrive at at the time that these things are happening you'll see that they track Revelations 10 uh 10 and 11 they track Daniel 12 1:4 and 10 11 9 and 10 there there's this harmony with these very things how he says don't try to be or do anything more than live a close Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus Christ not running after the flashy we're not running after the charismatic we're not running after something things that the world's going to cause call great but we're want we're wanting to live close to God now brother brandom after he preaches these things and he feels like he's gone too far the next day he wants to re-record a certain portion of the sermon to go out on tape and remove a part so after he has had 24 hours or whatever it might have been to think about this was I doing the Trump accordion hands do I do that brother brandom the next day so so the thing that he says this is the next day after he's had time to think about it he says so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before God and serve him and do all that we know how to do and live good Christian lives he's had time to think about this this is a prophet that is staring something in its face and he recognizes something has transpired and these these mysterious events and things that are being revealed and things that he doesn't quite know yet and as he sees these things happening and he knows that it's been mysterious he knows that it's been powerful he knows that he's uh been caught up in this constellation of angels there's things that are so astounding and he says the one thing for us to do is to be reverent serve God do all that we know how to do live good Christian lives but it's right along and then he then I'm skipping some but listen he says but it's right along with what he said no one will know his coming they also would know nothing about the seven Thunder mystery so you see it's connected together I think that's important to understand that much we have an understanding of today because the rest of all of it unfolded but this is not unfolded but setting in my room I seen it unfold to the seven Thunders and that's as far as we can go right there now that's oo right especially if you if at that time he they didn't release the tape he originally preached and then he adds this over it and you're like ooh and now I trust that each and every one of you will try to find the original copy and study it for decades trying to dissect it to figure out what this last part was that unfolded he says now I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and do that which is right and love him all your life and serve him and God will take care of the rest this is the Matthew 6:33 this is the real this is the real wisdom of the of what we're facing when it comes to things unfolded and things revealed and things mysterious or things unknown that God has a program that God has a beaten path and that way is a way of righteousness and that program is the program of revealing and living and unfolding and manifesting and he says I've seen it unfold and all this is connected seven Thunders seal all these things are connected together and he says now I trust that what you'll do is serve God do what is right love him with all your life serve him and God will take care of the rest what we don't understand what we don't know what's left to be fulfilled we can't try to figure out and make it be fulfilled in our minds or try to make sense of it we've just got to keep living a Christian Life we can't have bitterness we can't strive we can't attack we can't try to tear down we've got to live the Christian Life when people take off their coat roll up their sleeves and want to box you because of something you've got to say no I'm sorry please forgive me that's not what I'm in this for I'm running this race to please Christ I want to win others to Christ I don't have time for that whatever your next job is do it but know that God will take care of the rest now in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 that was a very important piece to this because now I with with that setting that's where we are now we understand what these end time Commandments were and what he wants us to do and so we find ourselves now in this position as the bride of Christ in Satan's Eden being united together with her bridegroom the revealed word and there's this uniting going on and there's this life being lived as a consequence of it we could take all I want to read them again almost just read them all together without expounding so you understand this live a simple life keep doing what you're supposed to do keep right on doing what you're doing because there's something that's taking place that has a purpose and if you don't live the life that's you leave the purpose it's intended for so there is a calling there is a duty there is a be it unto me according to Thy word there's a time and a place that's been appointed for us to bring forth the full word of of God again in the lives that we live and however God chooses to to manifest that in many different ways 2 Corinthians chap 11:3 we'll get to verse four here in a moment hopefully now Paul says but I fear and it's interesting as he's speaking about a Godly jealousy prior to that and this fear is not inconsistent with love as you could study it and find that it's it's not that Paul was uh wrong but he says I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ as the serpent seduced Eve now if I could just be straight to the point in my Bible when it gets to Genesis chapter 3 it says the Temptation that's that's what that time that that uh uh that story tells us the temptation of mankind of the woman and then also Adam so as the serpent seduced the woman he seduced her from her obedience to God's word like that's just let's just put it in the most simple terms we can so if we want to build off of that metaphor as he says as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety he seduced her from her duty to her husband he seduced her from her duty to the word he seduced her from the purpose that God had intended for her in the beginning so that's put in the most simple terms what however you want to look at the unfolding and what he said and what he did and what it resulted in if we could take the the metaphor that Paul is working with as the serpent seduced the woman through his subtlety and brother BR when he writes this in the church age book remember we've shown clearly All Through the Ages that even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the word so s Satan through his subtlety entic the woman to leave the word so the Ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word this is always Satan's tactic until the every age continuing to turn away we have a final repudiation of the word by the World Church system that's how you get to Revelations 3 where Christ is on the outside of the church this Lal deene age ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word so the seduction of the serpent in the beginning was a t temption for the woman to leave the beaten path to leave the intended program to leave the purpose that God had intended it for he says a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus if I could put it this way then as we're wanting to narrow it down on this time as Paul says in his age I Fearless by any means this metaphor of the serpent beguiling Eve he would corrupt our minds Satan will try to tempt the bride away from her mate the revealed word he'll try to seduce her away from Simply believing and obeying Jesus Christ and he's seductive brother br will refer to Matthew 24 a lot it'll be so close and what is it it's a gospel that's so close and so near but it's trying to get you away from the Simplicity of Christ in first John chapter 2:18 he writes little children it is the last time this is the mindset and the attitude that Paul is working with that John is working with as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there many Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time the Antichrist Spirit was already at work against the church it had caused the Ephesian age by to turn slightly away from the word thereby causing its fall and so now the Antichrist spirit that Antichrist is the wicked one working against the word now I feel good about uh just how much been able to cover so far but I'm only maybe close to halfway through and I don't want this to seem disjointed but I want to look at the temptation of Christ in Matthew chapter 4 the temptation of Christ in the wilderness is going to mirror the one in Eden so Paul is using the temptation of Eve as the metaphor for how Satan is tempting the bride in the Bible after the new New Testament Church is born in particular the Corian Church a lot that he says to them that is perfect in this vein so what happened then was in its most simple way is the serpent Satan used the serpent he used the means to open Eve up to pursue knowledge apart from God's perfect will to gain knowledge to do something that was contrary to the will of God all under the guise of religion all you know that subtlety you know be so close brother brandom said emphasized over and over about this work in the end time as Matthew 24:24 puts it are you doing good this morning everybody feel all right it's only 11:30 I me that's not bad right I in I started a little bit late we had to pray for the infirm in the week the sick before I got up here in Matthew 4: 1-1 then was Jesus led of the spirit led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness as the woman was in God's garden now the man is in the wilderness of Satan's Eed he in the wilderness of humanity in the earth to be tempted of the devil just as the woman was tempted and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward in hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God isn't that just like the devil to ask you to do something to prove something that doesn't really need the proof If thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread now in in the context here is a man who the the humanity of Christ is hungry he has just fasted so there's the need to feed the body there's the need the human needs the human wants the human desires the struggle of the flesh that might crave something but the tempter says to change stones to bread that it might vindicate that you are a son of God and there's something very subtle about this request because there as I've even mentioned before this would have been the first miracle of his ministry to in a Wilderness in a time of famine take something Stony and by his word turn to bread that could feed him in man could you imagine the sermons we could have preached off of that type but Jesus recognizing the subtlety says in verse four it is written and he brings it back to the word in other words he's not saying well I'm a Son of God and I could do that but but or just do it to prove it he just says it's written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God in other words I may get hungry and it may be in my power to turn stones to bread it may be in my power to make money it may be in my power to feed my body maybe in my power to do a lot of natural things but you know what that's not the most important thing so Satan was trying to tempt him into deifying something Beyond to lift up and Elevate something beyond the word of God it's all the devil learns from this interaction that was his first scheme if he could put it that that way then the devil taketh him up into the holy City and Seth him on the Pinnacle of the temple as the scripture say he shall suddenly come to his Temple he says now again if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written oh Satan's learned something so now he's going to use the word this is his second scheme he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against a stone so it is there's some symmetry to the Messiah and I if thou be a Son of God here's what the word of God says so why don't you make it happen the Bible says you shall do this the Bible says this shall follow them that believe so just make it happen do it to prove it make a show of it make make these things happen and so he says it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God now there's wisdom in his response and is exposing Satan's scheme he's tempting him to perform the supernatural he's tempting him to do something that would cause the angels to come to his Aid and keep him from um dashing his foot against a stone the devil's not done he works in his third one again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them whether it be past present future showing these kingdoms he's showing them wives he's showing them a a family he's showing them all these things that he could have and saith unto him now that he has seen this all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me and Jesus said get thee hint Satan for it is written again he he doesn't deviate from the word thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve Jesus could have looked into the word and seen that it was written that all these kingdoms would be his he would see that to receive all these kingdoms would not be contrary to the Lord to the word but he realized that the end does not justify the means that he could not fulfill the word of God while dishonoring another part of the word of God so he comes back to the Simplicity of the word that I shall Worship the Lord my God and no other shall I serve says then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him in each instance if I could as I summarized the temptation of the woman to say that she was tempted to dis Disobedience to the word tempted to unfaithfulness to her husband in each instance it was submission to scripture that thed Satan's scheme he just finds the script that becomes the balancer to the other oh you're hungry you need bread and and he says well I you know what man shall not live by bread alone so I find something that gives him that is enlightening to the circumstance well they throw yourself down the angels will take charge you well the Bible says not to uh tempt the Lord thy God well why don't we just speed this thing up do what you're supposed to do here a a and get this over with but he says you I can't take shortcuts and I can't worship you so the tempter is using different angles brother brandham says this in uh the church age book chapter n in Matthew 4 where Jesus is tempted of the devil now focus on this he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word the language the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only and each of the three major trials that corresponded to the tempt it corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden so now he's showing us that The Temptations of Christ here in Matthew chapter 4 correspond exactly to the temptation of the woman in the Garden of Eden so now as a serpent beguiled Eve he's trying to beguile us and the example is seen in the garden and now with Christ the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word so he was tempted with the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and he overcame by the word he fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word it's this refrain personal Temptations Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way to know that you if you are overcoming because the word Can't Fail now notice again how Jesus overcame the World Systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of God our personal Temptations contending with ourselves in our personal life and battle with the worldly theologians The Temptations of the world the answer is obedience to the word and he says that it's all it's the personal temp temp ations and he says the Temptation in the wilderness and the Temptation in the garden were the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and in 1 John Chapter 2 it says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world we we'll come back to this maybe Wednesday night I just will skip over that the Temptation in the garden and the temptation of the Wilderness were the same I love how it's summarized in the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life Satan brings it in seed form into the garden then he's showing it even in its final form to Christ as he stands them up upon that high mountain apart and he says look at where it ends up make stones of bread now I've studied this for many years just trying to find just exactly how this thing could be delineated and how you could apply a header to each one and I found that they can all be moved around and so in some ways maybe it's not so much these individual Temptations break out into three but that each one is connected with those three lust and the pride those two lust and that Pride but you can see in the making stones of bread how that there was the lust of the flesh where it's not seeking the kingdom of God first that there's some self-preservation it's a lust for money it's lust for income lust for things and then to cast thyself from the temple to be rescued there was a certain pride of life uh uh he called it tempting God that what what a scene this would cause if he jumps off the temple seemingly to kill himself and the angels arrive at just the right time to vindicate him and it's this this even to me speaks of popularity where wow what this look at what has happened to this this vanity and this pride and then he offers all the kingdoms if he bows and worships and he shows them something that he could lust after the lust of the eyes the power even as we've looked at the women and each one of these things there's something that Satan is tipping his scheme he's showing you his tropes he's showing you what he uses now I'll read this I don't want to because I just want to stop but I kind of hate getting this far and just petering out here no offense to Peter but in the Harvest Time brother Bram says remember the Bible said in the mouth of three Witness says let every word be established we'll get on that in a few minutes on the three Temptations of Christ the three Temptations of ministers today where they make their fall you know how we always like to talk about the Temptations of a minister three Temptations of the church and where they make their fall three Temptations of an organization and where it makes its fall you liking this so far and the three Temptation in the individuals and where they make their fall listen to this the these areas that Satan tempts these areas that he tries to cause us to be seduced and to be beguiled we could look at these very deeply we could break them down we could take more time trying to dissect the Temptation in the garden even the Temptation in the wilderness but Paul brings us to 2 Corinthians 11:34 I want to hurry to finish this morning but I fear lest by any means as the serpent be guiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity it that is in Christ please take some time to pray about meditate on study if you'd like how our minds can be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ that is in a met that that the Temptation and the garden and the in willness are an example type or a metaphor of then in the same way that the woman fell but in the same way that Christ was tempted and did not fall how can our minds be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ and Paul then gives us something to to look at he says for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or if I could say accept another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with them and it says you'll bear with them it kind of gives this idea of suffering it but it's this sense that you will continue to exist you will sustain it's not just you put up with it you tolerate it but there is a way that you interact in it that you sustain another Jesus you keep alive another Spirit you keep alive another gospel you not just tolerate it but in your tolerance you're allowing it to ex subsist and to persist brother bam says in God of this evil age Adam's bride believed every bit of the word but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face in the personal temptation as Christ was tempted in his own personal life and had to contend with himself he overcame by the word the woman was tempted to fall and she had to face the enemy face to face and she fell Paul says I fear lest you'd be corrupted from the Simplicity of uh that is in Christ just as the woman and just as it was attempted on Christ now I'll I I'll just finish with these things I want um I'll maybe go back and cover back some of these things that we'd mentioned before but God hides in Simplicity when we even began this uh the series in that one thing have I desired the one thing desired the ultimate Simplicity is to have desires reduced to one to have one desire that we examine every other Pursuit and desire in light of and that it was that the our ultimate aspiration should be focused on a a singular objective and even use the phrasing that life should be the process of finding out what is valuable and what is not valuable and this effort that as we gain we understand value and we can get Beyond even what we immediately get out of that but get behind it to where it's through this research or through this finding and and this process of determining value that simplifies our life and I think it has application in so many different ways even just in how we are our lives are filled up with stuff but even how that we can make the message and the Bible just full of a bunch of stuff and we miss the Simplicity of it God hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same where God is hiding is where you find them and it's what Satan's trying to get us away from in those very Commandments to the woman of what she should not do was the mystery of what she should do and the Very things that Satan was trying to confuse her on that he's the same yesterday today and forever was the mystery was the power for her to be what God wanted her to be and so Satan was using these means to call her out from her obedience to the word of God so that the purpose of God would not be fulfilled in her life then Jesus comes and he's on Earth and he's LED of the spirit Into the Wilderness his ministry is going to begin it's going to be a short Ministry but he's going to be finishing a work that he was called to do so Satan shows up at that very moment and he uses these different schemes to try to tempt Jesus Christ away from obedience to the word of God whether it be face to face with the Enemy or in this personally Temptation personal Temptations of Christ or the Temptations of worldly systems or contending with himself he overcame by the word and Paul says just as Satan beguiled the woman he feared lest Satan would use schemes in the world to tempt the bride away from Christ if I can put this it self serving to my title but distract us away from the simple life but let me remind you he's trying to get us away from that simple Commandment that obedience to the word for our day Satan targets were God's expressing himself when Satan showed up in the Garden of Eden and there's a lot that could color this idea but Satan just didn't happen upon the serpent chose him for a reason he didn't just accidentally like the the the serpent was going to go beguile the armadillo so he's like and all of a sudden bumps into the woman a and instructions were unclear and so what he was supposed to try on the arm of lit Dow he's now trying to convince the woman to do something that's not the way that it worked it was deliberate so Satan is anticipating a and is trying to find God's next move so Satan is targeting himself where God is expressing himself and he's trying to cut God off at his next move and so he does this in the garden because there was an oncoming promise there was something that the man and the woman were going to fulfill there was a part of it that sat had anticipated that he's trying to figure out and now that the Messiah is being identified and this is a this is something that Satan can't disregard anymore because there was witnesses to this voice there was witnesses to this baptism now he's led the the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil and the devil is attacking where God is manifesting himself and he's trying to get him from his next move are you with me so when these things happen to Revelations 5 Revelations 8 Revelations 10 all these things happen in March of 63 all these things are being preached what is God's next move what is it we're to be doing next live a Christian Life go to church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for C Christ and tell the people how you love them let your testimony be with love all the time you just go on and live a good Christian Life just be a real humble be a real Christian try to live for God live honest with your fellow man love those who don't love you You' just be found doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing don't try to be anything more than just living a close Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus Christ and I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and do that which is right and love him with all your life and serve him and God will take care of the rest God is expressing himself for the next move for the very next thing so Satan's targeting where he's expressing himself to keep you from doing what God wants you to do Brothers come to your instruments there's a lot more here maybe we could explore when wednes night but brother makes brother Brandon makes this statement in God's gifts always find their places he's praying oh it's just so powerful let this hit home go listen to harvest time even listening to uh the unveiling of God he says make the little housewife so sweet and humble that she'll be able to lead others to you and they that be wise shall shine shine right we think glow like this is glitter like oh wow w't want but he just says so sweet and humble that she'll be able to lead others to you the gift you give her that feminine little ladylike may she be so ladylike till the neighbors will see her and want to be like her the just in studying and reading and it's kind kind of become at the Forefront in some of the news reporting just how uh trying to think of just the right way to say this there's this brand of Christian woman that is real bold and loud and obnoxious about obeying their man right and it it's really in congruent with the whole concept I'm a real woman that stays at home and cooks for my husband while I'm Ming a following on Tik Tok and telling everybody about it right it's like that's not it's really a it's really a poor representation of what the Bible wants a man to be and what the Bible wants a woman to be may she be so ladylike till the neighbors will see her and want to be like her make the man the shop worker he says whoever he is Lord make him humble a humble life like Christ that others might see we don't know where those people are standing out there father but we never want to leave the Grand Old Highway we don't want to get off the beaten path we don't want to get go astray we want to twist away from the program of God we don't want to mess the real program of God we don't want to twist our swells away from the real thing he says but we'll lean backwards Lean Forward reach way out anywhere to get a soul I want to stay in the simple life and reach forward lean backwards reach way out anywhere to get a soul put that Within our reach Lord we pray and give us the life that would cause people to want to live like that as we consecrate ourselves to you that's the simple life in summary I could say this when I looked at this The Simple Life of Christ that life that Taps into the mystery of Christ it's the life that just it lives as Christ Christ would live and in the way we could say Christ was an ordinary but he's made a he set an example for us he's got a program there's something that's in that ordinary course of Christ and I'm not trying to get caught up on the the pattern Interruption that the word can be at times or just how extraordinary The Life of Christ is and how times God does things out of the ordinary way and if something's just in the same ordinary course it's not God but there's a way that it fits with the Scripture it fits with the word and we've gotten in our ruts and we've gotten in our Traditions but the simple life that I'm identifying today is the that life that living that living the word of God in light of the great things that have happened today because that's the purpose of the great things that happened we're living in Satan's Eden where the power of Darkness powers of Darkness are worse than they've ever been before there's more Temptation in this age than there's ever been before there's never been more Darkness there's never been more perversion the onslaught of perversion is so great so what does God give his bride so that she could overcome the word he's given her the word and Satan now if he gives you the word and you have the word Satan is going to try to twist you away from the word and if he can't get you away from the word it is written he'll find other schemes to offer you to where you're starting to live this extravagant comp complicated Christian Life that isn't the the simple life that you're supposed to live there's so much there in this image for us to take into consideration maybe go back and listen to those things or read those things if you want the quotes I can provide them for you just get humble stay humble live the life go on and live a good Christian Life we're not leaving Behind these things we're in them we're studying them we're learning them they're unfolding to us we stay in the word of God we pray we read our Bibles we feed on the word of God and then always remind yourself the outcome of that the product should be to live a Christian Life and I believe that we can simplify Our Lives by getting deeper with Christ God bless you today thank you so much for your prayers for me God is good God's doing great things just excited about all the things that God is doing in our church what God is doing in other people's lives I could even say this it's exciting and thrilling to see God moving in other people's lives even if they're moving if it's God we Rejoice we're happy and if it's not God we don't want to Rejoice right we sorrow maybe we pray we desire God uh uh uh to bless but let me say this God watches out over the faithful he watches out over the faithful and we will not fear what man could do unto us uh we won't fear the things that are for boing the things that are on the horizon if God allows it it's for my good in his glory and and so just remain steadfast a a and look for the good and and busy ourselves with one another because God is doing such Supernatural things in our midst and we may not even see them but they're happening but the reason why we don't see them is we're looking right over the top of them but as I have the advantage point the vantage point today I can just look and see the goodness of God and all that he's doing so don't look past it today as you are dismissed soon you see one another just look at what God is doing and rejoice in it in one another and desire to be the wise who shine as the brightness of the firmament and turn many to God that's what you're going to do by burning for Christ by being a light and living the Christian Life oh Lord make me that humble shop worker make me that humble housewife let me be man let me be lady like whatever your calling may be I just want to be doing what I'm supposed to be doing could we pray together you can stand your feet while we pray
