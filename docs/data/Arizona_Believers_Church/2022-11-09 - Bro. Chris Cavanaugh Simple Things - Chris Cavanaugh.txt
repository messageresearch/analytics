TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so um before we get going this evening on my subject I just want to let you know that we're we're going to leave the the bonds of space tonight for another time so uh we won't be so much going over space again though we may come back to that at some point in the future uh but I felt that we needed to go a different direction or at least I I the lord gave me I feel like a a subject to to talk about and just a little bit different direction so instead of being out in space tonight we're going to come back to earth for a while and we're going to talk a little bit more about Earthly things instead of space driven things and so this evening the title that I'm going to be speaking on is simple things and I realized that if you see on my title slide it's not so simple and there's a reason for that uh and it's because a lot of times when we think of simple things uh we kind of get disappointed because most people we want something that's a little bit more than simple right if you get a wedding cake and somebody brings you a simple one and you're getting married it's not so great because you want the fancy cake right it's got to have the decorations it's got to be beautiful it has to be something compelling it has to write really catch people's attention and because you don't want to drop I don't know how much a wedding cake is 500 on a wedding cake that might just buy you a simple one I don't know I'm not sure how much they are my wedding cake was made by my sister-in-law so we didn't have to pay a whole lot for it so we were doing pretty good on that but the uh brother Brandon had talked about was simple things he he talked about how man likes to complicate things and man likes to to get down to where things are really difficult and and the churches like this is I I don't know if it's a church or a chapel but it certainly looked like a church to me and that's why I used the picture of it but you get a lot of dogmas in a church you get a lot of things and they'll do a lot of decorating of the church and then it looks great it's wonderful it's ornate it's not simple at all but yet what they're missing is the simple thing that needs to be in the church and so you know we bring them with us right the Lord comes with us hopefully he comes in our heart that's the that's the way it's supposed to be we're supposed to bring him along so but sometimes the simple things don't actually come out so simple but we're going to start off with a really simple thing this evening just to talk about just before we do I just want to let you know that I found out that uh I actually in a new youth group I didn't realize this until Friday night where we're at brother duffix and brother duffic had announced that his son had seen a bumper sticker and I was very excited to learn this because I I didn't realize that such a bumper exist bumper sticker existed but I found out that there's a brand new youth group brother Jeff you and me were in it it's called vintage youth so this evening for those of you that aren't in the regular youth group you can join the Vintage youth group so I kind of thought I would be in the classic youth group but I was told I was vintage so that's okay vintage is okay so this into this evening the the Vintage youth are going to be able to eat free that's and I don't think you can see it and I did that kind of on purpose that that says below with paying youth so what the youth are going to have to do is they're going to have to participate a little bit with me that's okay so I've Got Friends on the front row here so they'll be our participating Youth and that'll help pay for the Vintage youth that are getting to eat free this evening so that's our plan tonight so our our simple thing that we want to talk about um if you can go to the next slide Brothers there's a this is really simple and it says a malleable finite I can't even say it myself now slendraceous Coyle Rod of parallel axes with as Mutual terminates so nobody nobody has Google on right so no no no no no trying this is a really simple thing how many know what it is anybody kids but I'm pretty sure that almost everybody here knows what this is it's a very simple thing okay I was waiting for somebody to to like say oh I know what it is don't look it up Brothers no no no cheating on the back row because it'll kind of ruin things for us but this is a actually a statement that a person that I like that I work with likes to say often and the reason he likes to say it is because he feels it's impressive to say this particular phrase and he says it many times I guess he likes the way it rolls off his tongue to me it's kind of like I'm talking out of numbers right now and trying to get the names right because that's a tough one but anyway this is actually a simple thing and actually we're going to find out that you're going to know this I believe by the end of the service and part of the reason that I'm doing this is because I want you to understand that sometimes when we have simple things we can put it in such a way that people can't understand what we're talking about there's just no idea like I can repeat this phrase and you'll be like I have no idea you could repeat it a hundred times I have no idea what you're saying now I was raised Roman Catholic and I don't know about you all but I've been in services and I should say I've also been in services that weren't Roman Catholic where the minister gets up and he preaches and people come out of the service and they're all excited and everything is wonderful and they're like wow that was awesome and Emily like what did he say well I don't know but it was good it was it was it was Dynamic it was exciting yeah but what did it mean what did he say well it doesn't matter because it was so it was amazing like obviously we just have to wait until the Revelation comes and sometimes it just needs to be a simple thing and the Revelation can come that way because if you make it too difficult for people just like this statement if I make it too difficult yeah it's impressive right I've used some big words that's that's great but how does it actually help somebody how does it actually cause them to to know so in a little while I'm going to ask for some volunteers so if if volunteers are in the audience you guys be prepared to volunteer you don't have to but if you want the Vintage youth to eat free you've got to volunteer so so um turn with me to Romans the 11th chapter and it says this oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgment and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the Lord are who hath been his counselor so the reason I'm going to read these things first before we get into the simple part of this message is because I want to balance this out because we understand there's a depth to God that goes beyond things that we could imagine so we understand this that we're going to have a whole eternity to get to know the Lord because there's no way that you're going to get to know them now a lot of people feel like they've they've got them down like I've figured out God I know exactly what he's doing I know how everything works but the reality is that's going to take an eternity to do because God has simplified himself for us because he's come down to to bring it to our level then we we start to think oh I got it figured out no I understand what what's going on here and the reality is it's going to take an eternity to do that turn to Psalms 19. I'll just read it from there it says Psalms 19 verse 1 and then six and seven it says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit under the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof the law of the Lord is perfect it converts the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure it's making wise the simple so God is the one that makes us wise God is the one that brings wisdom to us he's the one that shows us these things and he's the one that brings these things forth to us and so I think it's just important to kind of get that out of the way first if if I talk about simple things and I preach in a simple way understand that I know that God is complicated but he's not complicated to us at least he shouldn't be because he's come down to reveal himself so as complicated as he is he's still going to reveal himself in a way that we can understand because what good does it do to bring someone to something where they can't understand what's going on it that doesn't help you to get there if you don't understand it so go ahead to the next one and what when he out to see it says this the Great Mighty Jehovah who thundered in Yonder who made the stars in the solar system so we didn't leave space altogether so who made the Earth out of things which does not appear spoken into existence but when he come to visit mankind he didn't write down on Golden chariots but he chose to come to a little Hillside stable and his burst was in a cattle manger simple things but from that manger came Emmanuel what's the greatest thing of all age and time ages and all time is the life and the spirit of a baby that was born in a manger in a stable on the side of a hill so here we have a God that's created the universe and you know how much I like to talk about the universe because I think it's pretty impressive when I go out at night I don't live in the the lights of Phoenix so I can actually see stars and and to me it's very impressive but yet the god that created all that the god that wrote the Bible the the god that that basically took all of creation and moved it through time and the god that in in Eden when things kind of went South and things got complicated he took it and and through the the pages of time has brought it to where today he's revealed himself and opened up a book to where we're going to come back to a relationship with him just like Eden that's what you're back to right the Holy Ghost brings us back into Fellowship like the fellowship they had in the Garden of Eden that's the whole purpose of it but yet the Lord You know here he is and he's created the whole universe and when he decides to show himself he comes to a young girl right actually the angel comes to a young girl and announces listen you're going to have a a child his name's going to be Jesus and he's going to you know save his people from their sins and you know Mary had an amazing ability you know what that was she had pondering ability now I know we have Ponder points in the church I think they're awesome personally because pondering something is actually a good thing because it means that the first time you hear it you don't have to throw it out you can actually think about this is this is this what God's leading me to do is this part of the word of God can I can I see where this where I would fit into this and so Mary takes upon herself that pondering Spirit to where she's like okay I'm not sure I completely understand this Lord but you know you've told me that this is a promise to me and this is going to happen and I'm just going to settle there I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna let you work this out whatever it is I'm gonna let you work this out you're gonna be the one that's going to take care of everything I know that you've got it under under control everything's going to be all right because you're working it out now certainly she had problems because when this happens which it did because we know that it did right I hope so Christmas is coming up the whole world thinks that happened at Christmas time but we know you know when it really happened but it's happened and now Mary's having to deal with the reproach of those things because here she is not quite married yet she's spoused but hasn't had the ceremony yet and now she's pregnant right so it doesn't mean that simple things always make life simple for you right Promises of God don't always make life simple for you things that you that you deal with aren't always simple there's things that might come your way that may not be simple from just following a promise of God so that's where we're at with that so in the the sermon I am the resurrection in life brother Brown says God is not complicated people sometimes want to make him complicated but he God is known in Simplicity we look over the top of him trying to find him and he's so simple makes himself that way that's what makes him great and so just like in in the in the Garden of Eden now we could go back and and pain when he first started out he was that there was a a simple thing that happened his his brother Abel offers a better sacrifice right it's an accepted sacrifice and the interesting thing about Cain is when he's told listen if you just do well in other words do what your brother did I'm going to accept that there wasn't a whole lot of other there there wasn't a whole lot of other requirements put on him it was you just have to do well so just do what Abel did I'm going to accept it but just like people like to do they like to make things complicated you know we like to get I I think that Satan is the an expert at making things complex for people and I didn't put it into the slideshow but brother Brandon is talking about people and I'm not going to preach on complexes don't get me wrong but I just want to let you know so she's talking to a lady in the sermon contending for the faith and and the woman um comes up to for prayer and he says so I suppose we're strangers to each other not knowing each other and he says I see the woman now she moves from from me yes the woman is very much tore up about it and she had a nervous breakdown been very bad had a breakdown you're still suffering from it that's the truth isn't it and the sister says yes said you've had real funny feelings going through you all the time and especially real late of evening get real strange feeling isn't that right then I see you sitting down in a chair kind of late of an evening too you get tired you can't do your work and it isn't that right causes even stomach condition in you like that acids and things when you drink coffee or something another on that line you belch up acid or your stomach and so forth that's right I see you moving away from the table where there is stuff like that on by the window near window and I see a dark shadow of following you too which is a devil and he has almost tempted you to Suicide sometime telling you that you had crossed the separating line that you wasn't never going to be saved is that right so the woman has what we would call a complex what's happened there's layer upon layer of things that has happened with This Woman's life there's a situation that's happening it gets more complete complicated and more complex and so now she's gotten to be an older woman and she's like I don't I have all these problems I don't know why I have all these problems why is it built up that way and now if you have Psychiatry what they're going to do is kind of peel it like an onion because it's layer upon layer so they're going to start with the first layer they're going to work their way back and work their way back but God doesn't have to do it that way he can cut right through the onion get to the heart of the thing so he gets right to the heart of the matter so this whole trouble she's got stomach trouble she's she's so nervous she doesn't know what to do she's having problems sleeping she has you know physical problems she has mental issues she's thinking of of taking her own life she's got all these problems and it's very complex because Satan has built up those complexities over all that time and you know what the problem was when she was a child a dog chased her so brother Branham under the inspiration of the Lord takes her back to when you're a child and he's and he says that so here she has that dark shadow following her now the very thing that's here that knows your life I see it go way back to a little girl I see you as a little girl you were running from something it was something chasing you it was a dog it seemed like he was coming from school or something way long ago scared you and you've been nervous like all your life that's true isn't it that's true it was a simple thing that started off and made it complex through her life to where she didn't have any idea of what was going on like why is it why why do I have all these problems today why why can't I settle down why am I filled with anxiety why am I filled with all these things it was a simple thing that began it I've been chased by dogs it didn't have that effect on me so and a lot of people get chased by dogs maybe I'm gonna get bit by him I guess Philip's dad was the mailman did he ever get bit by a dog oh do you got bit by a dog see and you're doing okay right so you never know what simple thing can affect somebody because it could be at the age it could take you at an age when you just don't know how to cope with it and it builds up and builds up now again I'm not going down into complexes or whatever but I just want to say this is what Satan does is he wants to take simple things and complicate he wants to complicate your life and he'll use simple things to do it and then those simple things add more things on top of that and more things on top of that until you don't realize what's going on or where you're going with it or what's happening whatsoever I got to move faster because I'm not getting through this too quick so we left off with Mary and Sorry God is not complicated right people sometimes want to make him complicated so that's what I'm getting at is people want to make them complicated but God does some amazing things just simply so we can think back in the scripture with David so we've got a giant out there right and everybody's scared of the Giant and here's a little guy comes out not very big he was pretty scrawny brother random said but he had a nice Leather Pouch with some string leather string on it and he knew how to throw a rock and so he takes something simple to overcome his enemy so he's out there he's going to defeat his enemy he's got something simple in his hand all he has to do is take that rock throw it and it sounds pretty simple to me right hey that's pretty easy right I've got hey I've got a sling I can swing this thing and throw a rock but you have to realize there was a whole lot of things going on in that battle with Israel and everybody else is scared we got all kinds of armor hey David we're going to give you some armor we're going to put it on you he's like no that's too complicated for me I need something simple I need something plain and easy I need something that that's going to take care of this once and for all so we're going to do something really easy and David goes and he slays the giant right we know that story okay let's give you a hint on our our our definition that we gave earlier so this is this is something that you can use to open Secrets so if I write it down so you know no you don't have to write it down it's easy it's okay you don't have to write it down but that's your first clue about what is that slendraceous thing that we talked about earlier okay see I'm going to try and keep the kids interested in what we're doing because I want them to try and solve the puzzle if they can so we've got David out there with a sling and he's got something going on so we're going to talk just a little bit about Gideon so here's Gideon he's living in fear he's oppressed he's depressed he's hiding out by a wine press the meeting nights have taken over the land they're not letting them eat they got to go out and hide in order to produce their food they have to do something to make that food so he's out there crushing stuff and shaking it to get the chaff off so he can just get some some wheat to make some bread so that he can live and then God comes to him and says hey get in your Mighty Man of Valor I'm going to do something great with you and Gideon goes through a whole lot of turmoil because again getting is kind of like us sometimes we're oppressed sometimes we're depressed you know he talks about his family he's like look at him my family's nobody we're poor so he's got a lot of self-pity he's dealing with you know everything's bad nothing's good right now and so God starts to work through that and he allows him to to put some what they call fleeces out and he said hey if there's doing it and I squeeze it you know nothing's on the ground great and if there's you know stuff on the ground but nothing on the do hey I know you're there and eventually the Lord just works through all that that complex that Gideon's got to get down to the simple thing that he had inside him from the very beginning because in God's mind he was always a man of Valor he just didn't see himself that way then but in there he simply was a man of Valor and all that had to be happening was those layers of problems and the complications had to be pulled away and drawn back and it had to be fixed that way and so Gideon comes up and brother if you can go to the next slide and here's an army and they're waiting for him and that Army's sitting there and they're ready to get him and the Army is is a big army it's well funded it's got really good weapons it's got really good protection and not only that it's got the whole government behind it because they are the government and the the Lord says we're going to deliver these men into your hands and so he he's going to get everything together and make sure that um we have Warriors to fight so they got about 32 000 guys it starts out with it's a big it's a big group not as big as they wanted but pretty big group then God says this is too many right got to get it down I need it a little bit simpler so I said hey anybody that's afraid go home right if if you're afraid go home so a bunch of them go so then it's like okay this is still too many we got to get it down so then they go to drink out of the water right and the ones that that you know keep their eyes up and drink like a dog he said okay count those out 300 guys okay now bear in mind here's an army and I'm just giving pictures we could imagine these things but since we actually use this I'm trying to use pictures because usually I Don't Preach with pictures but now we've got an army and now we've got 300 people and so it's it's going to get very exciting now because we're going to go and fight with 300 people how are we going to do it so if you can go to the next slide this is what they get Gideon you and your 300 men you're going to get a pot a water pot without water in it you're going to get a lamp and you're going to get a trumpet or a horn this is how you're going to defeat it simple things right it was just simple things now boys if you're going to battle you think you want to go with that they got swords and Spears brother Chris he's going to give you a pot and a lamp and a horn what do you say let's go not really no but you realize it's simple things it was just simple things but what was important was the one that was controlling the simple things so who was behind it was the one that mattered the number of people there and the thing that they were fighting with it wasn't the important thing it was what was operating that thing what was in in there for them and again simple things were there simple things were present and so they go out with they've got this pot they got the lamp in the pot and they've got their horn and when Gideon gives a sign they break the pot they've got their lamp now that this whole tribe so they broke up in three groups 100 on each side kind of in a triangle shape I guess you'd say or maybe in a circle but 100 per group and then they blow the horns and then they start to shout and all that did was cause the enemy to be confounded and it caused them to start killing themselves because they were using simple things that Lord told them to use just simple things that the Lord told them to use there's one day in a battle there's a man called Samson and Samson had a tendency to get in trouble especially with the people that he hung out with not just with his enemies but with his brothers because he just kind of liked to stir trouble he was just the kind of guy that did those things and so one day Samson is is doing something and and people get mad at him for doing it and they're saying Samson you can't do that and the the the Philistines are going to come and destroy us you got to do something you got to fix this problem Samson we we need to to you know get away from these Philistine people they're going to hurt us and you know you've got strength but we don't have this so um we want to tie you up and deliver you into their hands and so he makes some promise you won't do anything to me because you're my brothers I don't want you to hurt me but just promise and so they they tie them up with chords and deliver them to his enemy and again here's Samson and so I want you to kind of boys you can imagine this or girls girls probably don't like battles so much I don't know so maybe some girls like to do girls like to fight no good okay sometimes people like that I don't know you never know like fight with your sisters who knows I'm not sure but here's here's here's um Samson and you can just kind of Imagine That Samson's taken up he's placed up on a hill with Philistines all around him and what he begins to do is to to once they he realizes that you know the the his friends have backed away and he's left alone then he just breaks those chords and he grabs something he reaches down and he grabs and so just imagine there's two guys there and they're watching the watching the scene happen and they're and the one says to the other hey you know he's got a spy glass and he's like hey what's he doing and he's like well it looks like he's going to fight him and he's like fight him how's he fighting him well he's got buddy and he's like buddy what do you mean buddy you know buddy the borough he's like buddy the Burrow's dead I'm like yeah nobody the borough is dead but he's got his Jawbone in his hand and he's ready to take him on could you go to the next slide brother so here he is he's ready to take on buddy the borough take him on with Buddy of the borough so you can imagine he's surrounded by a whole Army a thousand people and he starts whacking them so the brothers looking like wow that is buddy it's Buddy the burrow he's got buddy the donkey right burrow donkey got it okay we know a buddy the burrow so that's why I'm using buddy the borough because he's a great donkey so but all he's swinging is a a Jawbone and the scripture teaches us that there was a thousand people armed dangerous right but just with a Jawbone defeats that enemy and then as he he gets to the end of this battle and they're watching the battle he's looking through and he's like wow that's amazing he's like buddy is I can't believe Buddy's Jawbone is that strong like how is it holding up to all of this and then after the enemy is is defeated they're looking through this thing and what do they see is like oh man Samson he's wiped out he's I don't think he's going to be able to go on like he looks like he's ready to fall down and then as they look through what do they see they see him take that Jawbone and open it and drink from it so not only does he have the thing to defeat his enemy but he has the thing to gain strength again before the enemy can come another time and that Saints is what God does for us you defeat your enemy with the word of God you defeat your enemy through those things and while you have to because look at sometimes when you go through a trial or a test you need time let's face it to recuperate right you need time to get your strength back and the water of the word does that so the same thing that defeats your enemy is the same thing that gives you the strength to be prepared for the next time the enemy comes because he's not going to give up while you're here they're going to keep trying and keep trying until they get to you and that's their job right what's Satan here for he's trying he's he's trying to defeat God's people any way that he can but the same thing that that will save you is the same thing that will will strengthen you for the next time the same thing that will deliver you from an enemy is the same thing that's going to provide you everything that you need the next time the enemy comes and you'll gain that strength each time that it's necessary through simple things it's just simple things that gets us there so let's go to the next slide God takes simple things it doesn't take great things it takes simple things used right it ain't altogether simple things but it's got to be used right every man lived in the wilderness wasn't to John every man carried a slingshot wasn't David every man picked up a job and of a mule wasn't a Samson but when it's used in the Anointed Hands of servant of God and remember we talked about the Lord earlier when he was a baby there was a lot of children who's been born in Stables a lot of children may have been born in mangers but it's the way or what you do with it so that's the kind of the thought that I want you to have in the back of your mind it's simple things but it's what's it Anointed with how is it happening or how is it working that way so that's the important part of it that I want you to get to is that's what is is working on for you is those things in Ephesians 6 the 11 6 chapter 11 and 12 it says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand Against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers and against us uh against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so what we're doing is actually using something that the the Lord provides for us and the thing is is that we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but what we are using is simple things that the Lord provides so if you have hope and now I'm not talking about like I hope I win the lottery because it's 1.2 billion dollars because that's just a Wishful thought but hope that's based on something so what does Hope allow you to overcome discouragement right because if I hope in something if I you know someday that you these young men and women up here will eventually be like well I hope I find a boy that likes me or I hope I find a girl that likes me right because but that's not the kind of hope that we're talking about what it is is when somebody actually shows an interest in it and then you hope that you get the courage to talk to him because now you you know there's something on the other end working in your favor you just got to get there and when we have things like we so if we have joy Joy allows us to overcome sorrow it allows us to defeat that enemy it allows us to overcome depression if we have peace in our heart it allows us to overcome anxiety so God uses these things to simple things right but they're from his word and they're empowered by the Holy Ghost you know there's a lot of people let's put it this way there's a lot of people that have joy right there's a lot of people that that have peace but there's not a lot of people that have peace that passes all understanding because you're not going to get it without the spirit of God it can't happen you can have a level of Peace you can have a level of Joy right but there's nothing like the joy of your salvation because you realize that that joy that a lot of people have it's going to come to an end at the end of their life and so they know they've only got a limited time but for you when you have a joy of your salvation you know like look at when I get to the end of the road here I know I'm going Beyond this to something better than this so I've got joy right now but I've got Greater Joy coming so I can have joy like nobody else can have joy I can have peace like nobody else can have peace I can have hope like nobody else can have hope and it's because it's under an anointing and it's under a promise of God it's something that God is doing through you or God is able to work through and then that way when you have something come up there's a stressor in your life and anxiety comes upon you you can look back and say I've got the joy of my salvation I've got a piece that passes all understanding and if it's not present there you've got a prayer that you can put before the Lord and that will come to you it'll change you it'll change your destination it'll change your environment and it'll keep those complexes from building up on you it won't let you wallow in self-pity you know we have there's a lot of people that have love would you agree I think that in fact they talk about it all the time all you need is love right that's all you need just need love but everybody in the human race for the most part at some point has love for something whether it's animals people whatever their job a car like some people really love cars they have love for something but that kind of love also is unable to do things like the love that the Lord gives you can because he's got a kind of love that goes to where you know if you have love and you love your friends most people can do that if you can love the people that you hang out with and you know you get along with and everybody's happy with most people can do that but it takes a special kind of love to love your enemies and that love is the only thing that can come from the Lord he's the one that has to bring that to you in First Peter 4 8. says above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for a charity shall cover the multitude of sins and I think that that's the greatest thing that we can have is love simply because it can make up for a lack of a lot of things if you have a fervent love one for another it can make up for the fact that maybe you're not so joyful around the person it can make up for the fact that maybe sometimes you're not as as resting like you're you're a little bit anxious sometimes around them but if you have real love for them it'll help you get to having peace around people that you just can't quite get along with or just can't quite deal with or just can't quite you know figure out it'll help you in that way okay I wanna and switch just a little bit here and I want to give some now before I give a testimony I need to volunteer okay so we were talking earlier and I'm going to try and say this without stumbling through it this time a malleable finite cylinderacious coil Rod of parallel axis with azimuthal terminates so you're going to get come on now I don't want you to say anything okay that's it you know what it is I'll take your seat for a minute do you think everybody else will know maybe okay don't write it down don't say anything yet so I want to give a little testimony or by way of a testimony um in the 1970s my wife's family was living in Tucson Arizona and the they were part of the Tucson Tabernacle group uh they I don't know how they met I don't recall but anyway they're part of the Tucson Tabernacle group and there was a large part of that group that decided that they should move to Israel so in the early part of the 1970s they head to Israel and they get to Israel and actually they didn't go to Israel first they went into Belgium I believe and then eventually end up in Israel and so they're in Israel for a while during that time their djokovic's dad has odd jobs that he's doing different things that he's working on but he eventually gets a job as a chauffeur and I'm not going to use names because simply this goes out on the internet so I'll try to avoid names but just kind of give place to things so anyways he gets this job with the chauffeur the the lady is a fairly important person in Israel she's actually running a Hebrew language school and he works for her for a while they have tests and trials whether in Israel just like everybody has like we have in Arizona it's not much different it's kind of desert they have tests and trials over there we got tests and trials here you got things that happen but just through the course of Life they're there for a few years and then they move back to Tucson well uh while they're overseas their oldest daughter really falls in love with the country she's old enough at that time to kind of build a relationship with people she just likes Israel itself and eventually when she becomes a teenager she moves back there so the families come back to Tucson at this time and then eventually they go to Nebraska well Iowa and then Nebraska and then Minnesota and then I believe it's from Minnesota right that she ends up moving to Israel so she goes back over there and and um during that time uh um Djokovic and I would have gotten married I'm sorry I'm using your name and it's going on the internet I guess that's okay I can use her name um we had gotten married and right around that time her sister that's just a little bit younger than her uh decides to move to Israel as well and so she gets over to Israel um and she begins to work for this lady that runs this Hebrew language school because her sister that it went prior to her had become her assistant and so she gets a job with the same person and in the course of time and I'm sorry I'm trying to make this really abbreviated but in the course of time uh there's a a young man that comes from England and uh he had a girlfriend at the time but he shows up in this uh at the Hebrew language school and um happens to meet their sister and when they meet they end up falling in love they end up getting married and after they get married um they're in England and living in England and so in um 93. in 1993 I have it in my notes but in 1993 they end up going to uh sorry they end up being married in England and um at that time again Jacob and I were married in 1989 but in in 1993 we go to the wedding in England and uh the man that she marries is very British so much so that he goes out of his way to tell us how Great Britain is and how terrible America is and that uh you know basically uh the last thing that he would ever do is move to America and we're like okay okay you know he's gonna I'm gonna raise my kids in an English you know very uh uh proper school it's going to be just an amazing place um it's going to be you know a proper English education um and there's a lot of conversation that goes on at this time but he makes it very clear he's never coming to America so okay you're never coming to America got it and a few years later um actually he uh is about October of 96 so this is 93 when they're married in in 96 uh he can't find a job so guess who calls somebody from America says hey you want to come to America and work hey why not you know go to America so he moves to America and um in the summer of uh 99 I guess it would be um they have their is it their first child or second second child okay so the first child was born in England second child is born in um and or is going to be born actually in Ohio so they're and they end up in in Cincinnati Ohio so I'm going to leave off that story for just a little little bit but anyway in the 70s the parents go to Israel um eventually in the 80s some of the kids follow in the 90s now that they've gotten married and come to America even though they would never be here uh and you know the story moves on so go back to to um Djokovic and I so we got married in 89 and we had our first child in 94. everything was fine no problems at all and June of 97 we had our second child and the second child everything seemed great he looked extremely healthy but within 24 hours he had to have emergency surgery and the emergency surgery was was because he had a blockage in his intestines and he had what's called short gut syndrome or jejuna letresia short gut syndrome is the easier simpler way to talk about it but basically what he had was about 70 of a small intestine was missing there would have been something that happened when he was developing that wasn't there um he had all these issues and problems and um during this time by the way the folks that had been in Cincinnati eventually moved to Albuquerque New Mexico and the the brother that um married her sister ends up getting the Holy Ghost in Albuquerque at least that's what he reported to us and anyway so Caleb has this emergency sorry I didn't mean to use a name but um our son has an emergency surgery within 24 hours uh they end up having to leave a section of his intestine he's lost so much of it that they're figuring that he's not going to be able to survive without as much as they could possibly leave and so um they they leave a section that's really distended or in other words spread out it's made really big it shouldn't even be there because at that time it should only be about as big as a pencil so your intestine is a baby but it's really stretched out um he has to get fed through IVs so we're having to do like this kind of yellow liquid stuff that's vitamins and minerals and stuff pumped into them through what's the central line in the central line just so you know it goes right to the heart so it has to get to the first chamber because it's too hard on on the vascular system it ruins it so it has to get there right away and um he's got this eventually he gets something into his tummy called a G-tube to get other well he gets a thing first down his nose to go into his stomach he doesn't really tolerate Foods well it's years of care eventually we went I'm going to try and shorten this a bit we end up in the Make-A-Wish Foundation um and if you don't know what that is it's basically for chronic and eventually terminal children or people in the Make-A-Wish Foundation so he ends up into that particular thing uh jock Vince since I've already used your name I'll keep using it Djokovic becomes a nurse because there's nursing things that have to be done you have to change bandages on these Central lines we become frequent flyers to the hospital because every time he gets a fever we've got to go so if it's over 100 you get a trip to the hospital so the hospital's got to know us really well we were there a lot because kids if they teeth well they'd say they don't but if they tee they get fevers if if you blink at them they get fevers if somebody has a cold they get a fever I mean we went all the time and there are several of you here that know this whole story so um but anyway we're in this Make-A-Wish Foundation and it's a lot of work like we have to carry a pack it's and he's Tethered to this pack with a line that goes to his stomach because we're feeding him that way and it's also a big trial because when you go into a store this was before the days where leashes were popular and it was people would always whisper just at the level where you could hear them because that's what people do and they'd be like how horrible that you would lease your child and how could you treat your child that way little do they know that this is the only way that the child gets fed is if you don't if you don't do this and it's basically running 24 hours a day because he he absorbs so little food that he's not able to to do anything so it just it has to keep feeding him and he's got this central line and um um and he'd had him in multiple places on his body on his head on his neck on his chest wherever they could access to because if it got pulled out or if um if something happened and they felt like there was a problem they would take it out mostly it got pulled out you know little kids would grab it or you know sometimes they would get hooked on something so it was a big to do uh anyways and by the way I I don't think I mentioned this but I think it was brother Aaron when he was if it was this Sunday but when he was saying that you know sometimes you need to to tell people what God did for you right was that Charles Spurgeon quote was that that right so this is me telling you what God did for us okay and and when he said that in fact my whole sermon wasn't even going to be this I was going a completely other direction and then I I kind of got turned and then a couple days later he's like hey you know here's what we should do you should tell people what God did for you I'm like okay well I guess we're going this direction so anyways um after years of dealing with this and and there's a lot of problems that are our particular doctor was not a very uh the main primary physician was not a very encouraging person um and fought us on every turn every time we tried to do something he would be against it it was just a constant battle but we actually ended up with a pediatrician from Israel and so Jacques that had been there they had a connection so the Lord put this man into our path this pediatrician and he would actually fight for us so he would have the main physician fighting against us and the pediatrician fighting for us and so jock that carries around all these bags she's got all these things to do and by the way has also his kidneys had a problem too where they had what's called reflux so he had two kidneys but basically one was really tiny and the other was about a third smaller than it should have been so between the two he had the function of one kidney and he had reflux so he's got a lot of issues again he's in in the Make-A-Wish Foundation you know the Doctor Who I said is discouraging he's like hey you know um if he doesn't you know come through this particular stage of life or whatever there's not much hope for him there's really no hope there's nothing you can do and so we're asking is there any surgeries is there anything that can be done and of course everybody's praying like I won't mention names but people in this particular congregation are praying as well as we are so everybody's praying and uh her sister that had married the the man from England calls and says hey I'm going to have a baby will you come to Cincinnati Ohio well guess what brother Chris doesn't want his wife to do go to Cincinnati Ohio because it's it to take all the equipment necessary to care for this child and go to Cincinnati is really an undertaking but Djokovic was persistent and said she could do it and I believed her and so she went to Cincinnati Ohio and in Cincinnati was just like clockwork um Caleb Gets an infection and that means this trip straight to the hospital so in this infection when he gets to the hospital and he has this infection there's a surgical nurse that has taken an extra shift in the ER that evening and so Djokovic starts to explain what's going on and when she learns that he had a shortcut and she says have you ever considered doing the Bianchi procedure well we don't know Bianchi from a hole in the ground we don't know what Bianchi is because our physician has said there's nothing that can be done and it turns out that there's a surgery that could be done to where they can take a distended part of small intestine squeeze it basically split it in half for lack of a better term and make it longer so it took about a year and a half year to a year and a half of arguing with our doctor to let us go to do this surgery and in fact we boarded the plane just to kind of condense the story We boarded a plane without insurance and we told them we're going and the gentleman from Israel The Physician from Israel fought the whole time for this and he went through the whole procedure and uh sorry he went through the whole thing of the one physician arguing no I'm not going to sign this document because we had to have the primary physician sign to cover it so we boarded a plane got us in your hands we're going because this can help him and that that same doctor kept telling us well what if it what if it it makes him worse what if it kills them and it's like you've already told us you know he's going to die you've already said this is a problem so this is the way it's going to be so we board a plane and by the time we land the Lord had worked it out he'd signed that document and we had the surgery and when the surgeon comes out he says you know I really believe that that someone was in there with us because that distended area that they saved was just perfect he said we didn't have to do anything all we had to do was take and divide that section it was already there it was like it was just made for us and he said I felt like somebody was in the room with us and it worked it out and so we come back and my son had had not had any while we always worried about a central line infection he never had one until after the surgery and then it was sometime after the surgery that he had a central line infection for the first time so that time we went to the hospital they test them and it can be fatal by the way in just about 24 hours it's it because it's going right to your heart so it's right there so you get an infection in your heart it's really dangerous so anyway they pull out the central line and they put in a PICC line and jock bed says you know we don't want a central line to go back in because we're just believing that the Lord was in this whole thing so anyway to kind of condense this um within uh two years the surgery is a year it was a year it was a year within a year of the surgery he no longer has the central line uh he eventually gets off the tube that's feeding him that's in his belly um and then um when he's about six years old no before he was six sorry they said that the kidney problem so he has this reflux still and that's still going on and he's in church one night and the lord gave him a revelation because he came to his mom and said my kidneys are healed and a couple months later he had to go in for his reflux test and sure enough his reflux was gone and he never had it again so he never had that one more time so I'm going to leave this story for just a minute and we're going to come back to it because I want to just talk briefly really briefly yeah I've held you a really long time but we're almost done so so anyway the Lord has worked all this out and and I I thought about this with with Joshua you know one day that that Joshua and the children of Israel are around Jericho and they're marching around you know and when they get there maybe it doesn't seem like much because they're marching around and marching around so first day they show up somebody's in Jericho looking out over the wall he says Captain Captain the Israelites are out there he's like what are they doing does it look like they're attacking no they're just walking they're just walking around he's like well are they armed well they don't have any weapons out they got some trumpets they got some priests with an arc and and they've got Joshua but no they're just walking and the next day what are they doing up they're just walking then the next day what are they doing oh they're out there walking one time around then they stop I don't know day six what are they doing they're just walking what are they doing I don't know same thing they just walk around got their Ark got Joshua you know they're just walking and then comes day seven and he's like hey Captain hey the Israelites are walking again he's like okay they've been doing that for the past six days yeah but they've got some fervency now so they're going a lot faster today how many times have they been around oh three well now four oh eight uh five six oh it's now seven times because they've got some urgency right seventh day a little bit of urgency in them and then all of a sudden they stop and they start blowing horns and they start shouting and the walls start shaking and the walls come tumbling down and what was it that did it it was a simple thing they're walking they got trumpets this is a walled City I mean it's it's a fortress and you're not getting in there and there's people on the other side of that wall that are armed and ready for you to come in but all they did was walk and all they did was walk and then eventually it gets to that seventh day and they've got some urgency because it's getting closer to the time when they're going to defeat their enemies and get out of there they're going to take over Jericho and and and move on to something greater right so they're walking around and walking around and walking around and they're going to take over Jericho and I thought about that in this particular story so before I lose you on the on the on our definition I need my assistant to help me are you willing to help me okay so do you want to tell everybody what that thing was okay you can just do you want to announce it from there okay go ahead it's a paper clip that whole definition is for a paper clip so you actually know more sometimes than you think you know and it just depends on how it's explained to you as to what it is that you know so going back to that testimony in the 70s her parents go to Israel they've got tests and trials but they're walking right they're going through their life in in the 80s more family moves back to Israel got tests and trials marriage comes things happen they're still walking coming to the 90s and then we've got a baby that's born and a bunch of Prayers go out but I want you to consider this the simple thing that was happening that was taking place already was they were just walking all they were doing was living their lives Right Moves I you know I we could argue whether moves are simple or not I'm sure the kids would say a move was simple it was no problem you know I just pretty much got in the car and we drove to the next place I got out of the car and kind of helped mom and dad a little bit but for the most part I played it was awesome but for those that are moving it's like this is complicated it's a lot of things and you got a lot of prayer and but how many people have moved in your life it's it's a common thing right it's a simple thing we do it all the time now most of us don't move to Israel I'll Grant you that's a little more complicated but a lot of us have moved States in fact in this room multiple people I know have moved States I've done it several times myself we're just living our life right so here are these people they're just living their life they're just going through and they're walking right their their lives are maybe full of Trials and tests but they're walking and you know what they're walking is doing it's working its way to a miracle because all they're walking led to something else so before we ever prayed before we ever thought about what do what do we want to have happen here because we didn't know there was a problem until he's born and in fact the day that he's born we don't even think there's a problem until he starts throwing up because he looks very healthy everything looks great but inside there was a problem so our prayers start to happen in the 90s but God what people are walking he's already fixing that problem way back then everything is already working out and I have no in fact it took me years before I realized what had happened because you're just walking you don't realize that that God's doing something simple and that's something simple the next time it happens something simple and but it's actually really complicated but they were just walking and we ended up walking right into a miracle because God was already working all that stuff out before we ever prayed so I want to encourage you today there might be simple things that you're doing maybe today you're just walking and as as the time of the Lord approaches you're going to start being walking a little bit more fervently Maybe right because there's a change there's a body change coming and I I can tell you right now there's a number of people that have said I don't know there's just an urgency now like I feel like I have to get closer to the Lord I feel like there's something that's gotta that has to happen and all these things have been simple things moving along but a complicated or a complex God has been fixing it Satan likes to throw complexity in your life to draw you away but the simple truth is and this simple thing is just like you learned on something you know more than you think and sometimes we as preachers we we we get a little bit confusing because we try and make things so deep and the reality is it's really simple repent and be baptized you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's very simple brother Branham it's just simple Faith he says just like getting in your car or walking that same faith that brings the Holy Ghost into your life is the same faith that allows you to realize that that God's the same yesterday and today and forever there's not a Dogma that you have to worry about there's not a doctrine that you have to worry about what what you need is just that Joshua walking with you right and when that Joshua is walking with you you can walk right into a miracle or you can be somebody else's miracle and not even know it and that's okay you don't have to know everything you just have to trust in him why don't you stand with me this evening because sometimes we can walk and walk and walk and that simple Act of walking and Christian humility because brother Brandon spent a lot of time talking about just be a simple humble Christian why would he do that why was it necessary to do that we're going to have Emma since we're going to have Emma sing Emma if you want to make your way up sorry about that I just wanted to sing and then we'll sing some congregational songs but I just I I just want to encourage you today that just in your Christian walk just it doesn't have to be this Grand thing it can be you just living your life and and being a simple humble Christian that can make a difference for somebody else it can change somebody's destination we went from being in the Make-A-Wish Foundation to not being in it and in fact my son now is 25 25. so they said he wouldn't live past a teenager if if he couldn't get off the the feeding that he was on he wouldn't live past that time and if his if his kidneys didn't change that he would have to have surgery to fix that and then they also tried to talk us into by the way giving him growth hormones because he was really stunted in growth and they said even with growth hormones he would only be five foot two and so he prayed earnestly about that he ended up over five foot four without growth hormones they said it wasn't possible God deals in impossibilities and all you have to do is walk in it that's all you got to do right you these are simple things are our Warfare is not with the big weapons or even pots or lamps or any of those things but it's with an anointed king and it's with the Holy Ghost and in simple things you can overcome your enemy with with the love of God in your heart you can overcome whatever you need to in this life you can have peace that passes all understanding you can have joy in your salvation and you can have joy even when it feels like the world is closing in around you because you've got a god that is able to do something in your lives simply plainly he's more than able to do it and saints of God if I could say anything to you tonight just walk just the act of walking a simple humble Christian Life just the act of walking with the Lord will do it for you Emma why don't you go ahead and sing your song [Music]
