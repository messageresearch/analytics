[2:19] they
[2:20] they're they're like family to me so i i
[2:23] i didn't release them you know with i

[2:30] for me to take a family uh with uh
[2:35] brother john
[2:36] sister nicole the different ones the
[2:38] children and and to to be willing as a
[2:42] pastor who had pastored them for a long
[2:44] time
[2:45] some they had lived there a little bit
[2:47] then some it was remote and
[2:49] so so to do uh to really feel in my
[2:52] heart that i had a complete freedom
[2:54] to hand them into the care of another
[2:57] shepherd i tell you when brother aaron
[2:59] decided to come here and follow the
[3:02] leadership of thus saith the lord and
[3:04] start a church i said i said brother
[3:06] mike here you go this is perfect my
[3:09] heart's in it a thousand and one percent
[3:12] i couldn't think of a family better
[3:15] and so i would tell you something
[3:16] friends your pastor is loved near and
[3:18] far around the world and i know that
[3:20] i've been around the world
[3:22] his ministry is greatly coveted so hang
[3:26] on to him because the world would like
[3:27] to have him
[3:28] amen
[3:29] so praise the lord we're happy in the
[3:31] lord today i just think all things are
[3:34] wonderful especially you know when the
[3:36] lord does it it just turns out beautiful
[3:39] amen the enemy can fight it
[3:41] but you know i tell my church all the
[3:43] time he ain't nobody
[3:45] you know he don't he don't run nothing
[3:47] but his mouth
[3:48] you know he has no say in your life
[3:50] you're not subject to him we don't live
[3:52] by the mercies of lucifer we live by the
[3:55] mercies of christ
[3:57] amen anything he can do he has to get
[3:59] permission from from the lord
[4:02] so
[4:03] amen we don't sweat him we fight him
[4:05] amen i'm gonna fight him until i'm taken
[4:07] from the earth i want my last testimony
[4:10] to be that god's word was true and satan
[4:13] was a liar straight up liar amen the
[4:16] bible in the in the greek new testament
[4:19] where where it talks about how that he's
[4:21] the father of lies and that you know
[4:23] when he when he speaketh a lie
[4:26] from the greek diaglot he actually
[4:28] speaks his native language
[4:30] it's his native tongue a lie is his
[4:32] native tongue
[4:34] and so um live from the beginning so
[4:37] we we're thankful in the lord today and
[4:40] you
[4:40] be praying for me we've got two services
[4:42] so i don't have to try to get it all out
[4:44] today i won't weary you amen we won't
[4:47] because i don't want you to get
[4:48] oversaturated and lose uh the main point
[4:51] i'm taking a title today
[4:54] the purpose of god's church in the earth
[4:56] now that's slightly different brother
[4:58] aaron from what i gave you i've already
[4:59] corrected that with captain john
[5:01] so if it's if it can be changed to the
[5:03] purpose
[5:04] of god's church in the earth
[5:07] amen isaiah chapter 60.
[5:12] well you're not going to find isaiah 60
[5:14] in revelation 9.
[5:18] amen
[5:19] oh i just want i probably just gave you
[5:20] a clue where we're headed
[5:22] amen
[5:25] we're not going to turn to revelation 9
[5:27] but i'm going to make reference to it
[5:29] and we're going to just try to
[5:31] hit some bible study points because i
[5:33] want to focus
[5:34] you today
[5:35] on a specific thought and we're going to
[5:38] just keep whittling our way till we get
[5:40] to that specific thought i i you know i
[5:44] i don't want you to get the wrong idea
[5:47] that uh that i'm not here to preach to
[5:49] everyone
[5:50] i am but i'm i'm actually in my heart if
[5:55] i just be honest with you
[5:57] for me i i really want the young people
[6:00] especially the teenagers in that senior
[6:03] uh
[6:03] age group
[6:05] to really try to comprehend and get your
[6:07] mind
[6:08] excuse my voice this morning
[6:11] get your mind wrapped around
[6:13] the things that god is doing
[6:15] in the hour that we live not just the
[6:18] day but the very hour
[6:20] this is happening in real time and
[6:22] things are happening quickly
[6:24] and uh i'm going to tell you something
[6:26] friends catastrophic
[6:28] cataclysmic
[6:30] judgments and change are coming to the
[6:32] world they're they're they're racing to
[6:35] meet us
[6:36] and the only way out is up
[6:39] and so we want to be aware of satan's
[6:42] devices and so i sometimes people think
[6:45] teenagers can't comprehend the deeper
[6:47] things of god you'd be wrong
[6:49] their minds are in that learning gear
[6:51] and they get it a lot quicker and faster
[6:53] than you think they will
[6:55] and besides it's uh you know you get you
[6:57] get young people enthused and full of
[7:00] fire and zeal you'll you'll light a
[7:02] whole church on fire amen they'll go
[7:04] crazy with it and the old people
[7:06] next thing you know they'll be jumping
[7:08] in with zeal and so uh we're we're
[7:10] hoping to inspire their hearts today
[7:13] because uh are they have more of a
[7:16] mission today than they might realize
[7:18] and it is my hope that we can
[7:21] bring that kind of clear today arise
[7:24] shine isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 very
[7:27] familiar to us
[7:29] arise shine
[7:31] for thy light is coming someday
[7:35] i need to read that again
[7:38] arise shine for thy light has come
[7:41] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[7:44] thee so that's a right now scripture
[7:46] right
[7:47] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[7:49] earth and gross darkness the people but
[7:53] the lord shall arise upon thee and his
[7:56] glory shall be seen upon thee and the
[7:59] gentiles shall come to thy light and the
[8:02] kings and kings to the brightness of thy
[8:05] rising
[8:06] now
[8:07] i want you to drop down and look at
[8:10] verse 11
[8:12] therefore thy gates shall be opened
[8:15] continually they shall not be shut day
[8:18] nor night that men may bring them to
[8:21] thee the forces of the gentiles and that
[8:24] their kings may be brought for the
[8:27] nation and the kingdom
[8:29] that will not serve thee shall perish
[8:31] yea those nations shall be utterly
[8:33] wasted the glory of lebanon shall come
[8:35] unto thee the fir tree the pine tree the
[8:37] box together to beautify the place of my
[8:40] sanctuary and i will make the place of
[8:43] my feet glorious
[8:45] verse 18 violence shall no more be heard
[8:48] in thy land wasting nor destruction
[8:51] within thy borders but thou shalt call
[8:54] thy walls salvation and thy gates praise
[8:57] the sun shall be no more the light by
[9:00] day neither for brightness shall the
[9:02] moon give light unto thee but the lord
[9:04] shall be unto thee and everlasting light
[9:06] and thy glory
[9:08] thy and thy god thy glory the sun shall
[9:11] no more go down neither shall the moon
[9:13] withdraw itself for the lord shall be
[9:15] thine everlasting light and the days of
[9:18] the morning shall be ended thy people
[9:20] also shall be all righteous they shall
[9:24] inherit the land forever the branch of
[9:27] my planting the work of my hands that i
[9:30] may be glorified a little one shall
[9:32] become a thousand and a small one a
[9:34] strong nation i the lord will hasten it
[9:38] in his time
[9:40] let's pray
[9:41] father we thank you for your word now we
[9:44] commit this reading and this ministry
[9:47] and the audience the speaker and hearers
[9:49] into your hands in jesus name amen god
[9:51] bless you can be seated
[10:00] all right praise the lord
[10:04] now
[10:06] we
[10:07] have taken
[10:09] the
[10:11] the latter part of isaiah 60
[10:14] which of course is referencing
[10:16] you know a millennial world and from
[10:19] there we are we'll find ourselves in a
[10:21] new heavens and a new earth and the
[10:23] bible gives us such wonderful promises
[10:26] about that kingdom we know that the
[10:28] millennium uh is the uh the time of the
[10:32] honeymoon of the bride we realize the
[10:34] plan of redemption for god's family
[10:36] whose names are on the book of life of
[10:38] the lamb
[10:39] uh are now redeemed and we realize that
[10:43] you know
[10:44] the old testament bride the new
[10:46] testament bride moses and elijah the 144
[10:49] 000 they're all there together with us
[10:52] and uh we realize at the end of a
[10:54] thousand years then uh there's a the the
[10:58] the great white throne judgment and we
[11:01] we break from there into the new heavens
[11:03] and the new earth again i'm trying not
[11:05] to get bogged down into too much of that
[11:08] but
[11:09] but we found that before
[11:12] that
[11:13] wonderful reality
[11:15] can come
[11:17] you before you could get down to verse
[11:19] 11 or verse 18 or verse 22 you had to
[11:23] start at verse 1. there had to be
[11:25] something
[11:26] first to get us there you get me so
[11:29] today
[11:30] this may sound kind of strange but i'm
[11:32] i'm gonna try to have you thinking in
[11:35] reverse today so we're gonna rather a
[11:37] lot of times we start with where we are
[11:39] now where we're trying to get to but
[11:41] where we're going to get to is already
[11:43] set in the mind of god and the the issue
[11:46] has never been where am i going the
[11:48] question has always been where did i
[11:50] come from and so where i'm going is
[11:53] going to be according to the plan of god
[11:55] and so so we we know where we're headed
[11:58] we know that there's going to be a new
[12:01] heavens and a new earth we know that of
[12:03] the increase of the kingdom of the son
[12:06] of david there shall be no end of the
[12:08] increase of it there shall be no end now
[12:11] brother branham will tie that right to
[12:13] the hidden manna whereas we there was an
[12:16] application of that hidden manna in the
[12:19] church ages in history but brother
[12:21] branham talks about how that there's a
[12:23] future application uh how that some that
[12:26] that here we get a little taste of it
[12:29] and we think it's so good but someday he
[12:31] and that word will become what we never
[12:33] dreamed possible that it will be the the
[12:36] unfolding of the mystery of christ in
[12:39] the eternal ages to come
[12:42] science thinks today that they they they
[12:45] say definitively they can't find the
[12:47] borders of of of of of the universe and
[12:51] uh and they even think the universe is
[12:53] probably uh ever expanding to which i've
[12:56] always said good because a never-ending
[12:59] increase of the kingdom of christ is
[13:01] going to need an ever-expanding universe
[13:04] and so you realize friends that this is
[13:06] the real secret to the mystery of god
[13:09] that it's and this is why the
[13:10] trinitarians miss it this is why the
[13:12] oneness misses that's why the two
[13:14] dismiss it it's because they don't
[13:16] understand that it's god in an unfolding
[13:18] expression and so he's always
[13:21] unfolding himself expressing and it so
[13:24] happens now that he's at the stage of
[13:27] expression where there's a he he came
[13:30] and walked the shores of galilee and
[13:32] that was a that was the fullness of the
[13:35] word and a body walking the shores of
[13:38] galilee now god was never intending to
[13:41] stay bottled up in that one body the
[13:44] whole purpose was expanding into a
[13:46] family because that was god's design was
[13:49] to have a family god didn't just create
[13:51] a family as brother lonnie used to teach
[13:53] us so faithfully
[13:55] god became a family and so that's why
[13:58] the trinitarians miss it they they don't
[14:00] get that that whole thing is expression
[14:02] they think that every time there's a a
[14:04] different expression it's a different
[14:05] person and it's not
[14:07] it's just the same person he fills all
[14:09] time space in eternity he is omnipresent
[14:13] by his omniscience because he's
[14:15] all-knowing he's not like the wind
[14:18] he is a being he lives in a house but
[14:20] you understand that he's more than just
[14:22] some mythical something he's actually a
[14:24] very real person and that's why brother
[14:27] branham would say in paradox the person
[14:29] of god became a man and so so so you
[14:32] know when when you when you start to
[14:35] look at it in this in this way you see
[14:37] him now coming he said i'll send the
[14:40] promise of the father upon you because
[14:42] that's part of the plan and now god is
[14:44] going to be able to divide himself into
[14:47] the church and now the expression is
[14:49] going to become a many-membered body
[14:51] where the fullness of the godhead is
[14:54] once again contained but now in the
[14:56] earth but now it's in a many-membered
[14:58] body
[14:59] and that's why brother brannon would say
[15:01] now we have come to the end where we
[15:04] have a complete restoration of that a
[15:06] condition of the alpha church we're back
[15:08] to the abstract deed we're back to the
[15:11] full token we're back to the full word
[15:13] we're back to the mighty god unveiled
[15:17] amen
[15:18] it's all unsealed now god had to seal it
[15:21] up with seven seals because the church
[15:22] fell away they never could come to the
[15:25] change of the body the apostles died off
[15:27] the church began to backslide instead of
[15:29] christ being able to come and take a
[15:31] bride he has to sit back down in the
[15:33] eternities intercede on ignorance seal
[15:36] up the word in seven seals but he
[15:38] promised at the end time i'm going to
[15:40] unseal it
[15:42] the mighty god is going to be revealed
[15:44] and there's going to be a people who
[15:46] will take it eat it and become it
[15:49] and brother branham would say so now
[15:51] it's again we're back to the fullness of
[15:54] the godhead now it's in a many-membered
[15:56] body that brother braddon would actually
[15:58] say
[15:59] you aren't this is a direct quote you're
[16:01] part of god's godhead
[16:05] that's a
[16:07] that's what we call in the south a
[16:08] humdinger
[16:10] that's hard to get your mind around see
[16:12] and and so so a lot of times people
[16:16] they they get tripped up because they
[16:18] think of it in the wrong direction
[16:20] they see jesus as a human
[16:23] and they try to figure out going from
[16:25] that direction starting with the son
[16:28] how is he the father
[16:30] so how are they the same person and i
[16:32] would just say to you today
[16:34] flip it to its correct order because he
[16:36] wasn't a human first
[16:39] he was a spirit first
[16:41] then from there he became a pillar of
[16:42] fire it wasn't a different god same god
[16:45] amen so so rather than say how is the
[16:49] son the father look at it and realize
[16:51] that the father became a human
[16:54] not how is the human god but how is god
[16:56] now a human
[16:58] hallelujah he spoke to a virgin and and
[17:01] hovered over her and brought forth egg
[17:03] and seed and built a body and brother
[17:06] brandon said god crawled into that blood
[17:08] cell and began to push out arms and push
[17:10] out legs
[17:11] yes he was a hundred percent a human
[17:13] being yes he was a hundred percent god
[17:15] almighty that's what makes him a paradox
[17:20] because that's quite impossible but yet
[17:22] it is
[17:23] though it can't be
[17:24] but it is
[17:27] but it can't be
[17:29] but it is
[17:30] though it can't be but it actually is
[17:34] that's the paradox that's the beauty of
[17:36] it
[17:36] and that same god is now so young people
[17:40] what is the message all about
[17:42] why do i come here to this church with
[17:44] my parents why have i heard all my life
[17:46] god sent a prophet that's why because
[17:48] it's god restoring his promise and
[17:50] coming back to the church to restore the
[17:52] token to restore the abstract to take
[17:54] her finally now because this bride has
[17:57] actually got to go beyond the position
[18:00] the alpha church went you've got to go
[18:01] all the way to a body change
[18:04] you've got to actually be changed
[18:05] globally in a moment in a twinkling of
[18:08] an eye and that's never happened
[18:09] globally for god's family
[18:11] so so we're we're going
[18:14] somewhere
[18:15] your purpose your your life has a
[18:18] purpose
[18:20] and so you want to get with that purpose
[18:23] see that's how god
[18:27] that it's it's not like
[18:29] god is you know
[18:30] some
[18:31] twisted up being to say
[18:33] oh if you just kind of do everything i
[18:35] ask you to do i'ma hold a carrot out in
[18:37] front of you and if you just do
[18:38] everything i ask you to do i'm gonna i'm
[18:40] gonna bless you i'm gonna help you and
[18:42] if you mess up no no but if you're
[18:44] really a good boy that's not that's the
[18:46] whole wrong thinking of god you
[18:49] understand god had a purpose founded in
[18:52] love and he has a family and he wants to
[18:54] express himself and he's got a whole
[18:56] world for you to live in this life has
[18:58] never been about this life it's always
[19:01] about the next one coming
[19:03] this life is a proving grounds a
[19:05] training field and and we're we're we're
[19:08] here to to to become the children the
[19:12] royal family of almighty god and the
[19:15] heavens and the worlds to come
[19:17] what a privilege we have
[19:22] i'll get to my notes eventually
[19:26] so
[19:27] so we're we're looking then as i said i
[19:30] want you to look in reverse now because
[19:32] i've already cut to the chase and i've
[19:34] read you what the millennium is going to
[19:36] be like i've already read you because
[19:38] but prior you know you start you go
[19:40] we're going to the new heavens and the
[19:42] new earth of which there's no end and
[19:44] it's a constant expanding of his
[19:46] expression prior to that you have a
[19:48] millennium
[19:50] well between millen between millennium
[19:52] and that you've got the great white
[19:53] throne judgment where every man gets a
[19:55] fair trial
[19:57] every man
[19:58] and so
[20:00] i i i had a cousin who lost a husband
[20:02] some years ago he's only 30 years old
[20:05] don't think youth protects you he walked
[20:08] across the shop floor and fell down dead
[20:10] dead for hit the ground had a widowmaker
[20:12] heart attack at 30.
[20:14] and they weren't they didn't go to
[20:16] church you know they they really didn't
[20:18] and now she knows my cousin knows wow
[20:21] this doesn't bode well because and so
[20:24] she asked my dad because she knew that
[20:25] our family had always presented christ
[20:29] and she said uncle ed she said what
[20:31] about my husband
[20:32] tell me give me some and here's my dad
[20:35] knowing the man you know what what can
[20:37] you say in that moment there's almost no
[20:39] right word to say and my dad gave her
[20:41] the best answer i've ever heard he said
[20:42] teresa honey he said i can promise you
[20:44] this according to the bible he'll get a
[20:46] fair trial
[20:49] and an impartial god
[20:50] will judge him and we'll look in his
[20:52] heart and we'll make a decision and you
[20:55] know something
[20:57] that was okay for her she
[20:59] she took she said okay i can i can take
[21:01] that because she knew that that it would
[21:05] be it would be up to a god who god
[21:08] doesn't wake up in a bad mood
[21:11] thank god thank god
[21:13] we do
[21:14] he doesn't get up on the wrong side of
[21:16] the bed
[21:17] okay and so he he's oh that's i remember
[21:20] brother aaron came to our church one of
[21:22] the last times and so it's never left me
[21:24] i've still got the notes to the sermon
[21:26] and he just took a whole sermon to show
[21:28] definitively constantly definitively no
[21:30] way to get around it after he got
[21:32] finished that all of god's words are
[21:34] true and all of his ways are just all of
[21:37] them
[21:38] you cannot impugn him in any way all of
[21:40] his ways are just and all of his words
[21:42] are true
[21:44] and so that suffice she was content to
[21:47] hear that that every man will get a fair
[21:50] trial and so
[21:53] so we realize then that prior to that is
[21:55] a millennium prior to the millennium is
[21:57] right now
[21:59] there's a tribulation prior to the
[22:01] tribulation there's a bride in the earth
[22:03] amen see she's going to go up before the
[22:06] tribulation but right now the
[22:07] tribulation hasn't set in uh and it's in
[22:10] its full measure under the vials because
[22:12] the bride is still here
[22:14] and so so now we're now we're backing up
[22:17] in scripture we're coming all the way
[22:19] back up to isaiah 61. arise shine thy
[22:23] light has come here's the condition of
[22:25] the world that that group is going to
[22:27] live in darkness will cover the earth
[22:29] and gross darkness will cover the people
[22:32] but there's going to be a work happen
[22:34] there's going to be something take place
[22:37] now
[22:38] prior you say okay well
[22:40] what what what was the
[22:43] what caused isaiah 60 verse 1 to come
[22:46] true
[22:47] and that is found in chapter 59 all
[22:50] right now if we look at chapter 59 and i
[22:53] feel like i'm getting ahead of myself
[22:55] but i'm just having to follow the
[22:56] leadership of the lord because i've got
[22:58] material everywhere and i decided to do
[23:00] it on purpose this way let him lead me
[23:03] at the moment
[23:04] but if you look at chapter 59
[23:08] behold the lord's hand is not shortened
[23:10] that it cannot save
[23:11] neither his ear heavy that it cannot
[23:14] hear
[23:15] now i promise you what we're about to re
[23:17] read
[23:18] you're going to have so many mental
[23:20] images of the day and hour that you live
[23:23] in
[23:24] everything we're reading here because
[23:25] remember this what you're reading in
[23:27] chapter 59 and this is an important
[23:29] point
[23:31] chapter 59 is showing you the condition
[23:33] of the world
[23:35] when isaiah chapter 60 comes on the
[23:37] scene
[23:38] you get that so isaiah 60 comes on the
[23:41] scene because of what's happening in
[23:43] chapter 59. now look at it together
[23:45] we're not going to read it all behold
[23:47] the the lord's hand is not shortened
[23:49] that it cannot save
[23:50] neither his ear heavy that it cannot
[23:52] hear watch this now but your iniquities
[23:55] have separated between you and god you
[23:57] and your god and your sins have hid his
[24:00] face from you that he will not hear
[24:02] verse 4 none calleth for justice brother
[24:05] branham was talking about that in 1950
[24:07] he said there's no justice anymore it's
[24:09] all gone see none calleth for justice
[24:12] nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in
[24:15] vanity and speak lies they conceive
[24:17] mischief and bring forth iniquity if
[24:19] that's not the age i live in i don't
[24:21] know it
[24:22] that's that you're reading
[24:24] today's headlines and you're reading it
[24:26] in prophecy thousands of years ago
[24:30] because remember remember you say oh
[24:32] well yeah but this was israel at that
[24:33] time of course but remember
[24:36] for us
[24:37] it correlates to isaiah 60. now we
[24:40] believe we're in isaiah 60.
[24:42] arise shine my light has come do you
[24:44] believe that and it is the rising of the
[24:47] sun do we believe that so we're we're
[24:50] now placing ourselves in the historical
[24:52] timeline that isaiah 60s now so what so
[24:55] now when you're reading isaiah 59 just
[24:57] realize you're reading about what
[25:00] brought forth isaiah 60.
[25:03] there was none calling for justice verse
[25:05] 7 their feet run to evil
[25:08] and they make haste to shed innocent
[25:10] blood
[25:11] my goodness
[25:12] their thoughts i i'm sure i'm not unique
[25:15] i'm sure you're getting mental images of
[25:17] the headlines we see every day their
[25:19] feet run to evil and they make haste to
[25:21] shed innocent blood
[25:23] their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity
[25:25] wasting and destruction or in their past
[25:27] don't forget this had to be because
[25:30] jesus prophesied as it was in the days
[25:33] of noah
[25:34] and men's minds were evil continually
[25:37] all over the world see
[25:39] and so so we realize now you're seeing
[25:41] this come to pass verse 10
[25:45] now look at look at this at this
[25:46] reference to the condition in sodom we
[25:49] grope for the walls like the blind
[25:52] exactly what happened in the days of lot
[25:55] remember that the the two angels
[25:58] uh
[25:59] which i i i i
[26:02] i hope i'm not gonna get in trouble
[26:04] this is just brother jason i know i know
[26:06] some i know some people
[26:08] say
[26:09] and of course brother branham did and we
[26:11] believe that those two angels that went
[26:13] down there were a type of of uh oral
[26:15] roberts and a billy graham a mod brother
[26:17] and says the modern day version
[26:19] the modern day version of those men it
[26:21] wasn't billy graham and oral roberts in
[26:22] there but the modern day version of them
[26:24] would have been billy graham and oral
[26:26] roberts because that's exactly what they
[26:27] did they blinded the the world to think
[26:30] all i got to do is make a decision
[26:33] all i got to do is have an emotion under
[26:35] oral roberts all i got to do is see the
[26:37] supernatural like oral roberts could do
[26:39] all i got to do is have make a decision
[26:40] a mental decision for christ like billy
[26:42] graham taught and the whole world fell
[26:44] for that
[26:46] now i'm saying those men didn't find
[26:47] their place in christ but i'm simply
[26:49] saying their message has blinded the
[26:51] world to believing to an easy and easy
[26:54] believism that all you have to do is
[26:56] make a mental decision and you're born
[26:58] again
[27:00] all you got to do is have a sensation or
[27:02] be able to demonstrate some supernatural
[27:04] power i'm here to tell you the life of
[27:06] christ is far more than that
[27:09] far more than that friends it's a it's a
[27:11] reality it's a revelation of of almighty
[27:13] god made personal to you how what does
[27:16] that even mean it means that that i have
[27:18] recognized who i am that i'm part of him
[27:22] it's a revelation of him personally to
[27:25] me
[27:26] i see myself in the revelation
[27:30] not just a mental understanding of who
[27:33] he was but who i am and the position
[27:36] i've been brought into in christ
[27:40] that's what the new birth does
[27:43] that's when you realize intrinsically
[27:45] your life is not your own
[27:47] you're not just taught that it becomes
[27:49] your nature
[27:50] see
[27:52] so
[27:54] so we realize now
[27:56] we
[27:57] we grope for the walls like the blind
[27:59] and the point i was going to make
[28:01] is that you have to be careful on the
[28:03] types because you've got to make it fit
[28:05] the book of revelation a lot of people
[28:07] thought that well as soon as billy
[28:09] graham
[28:10] and oral roberts went off the scene
[28:12] then the fire had to fall and they've
[28:15] been gone for years
[28:17] and the fire hasn't fell and that's
[28:18] because to get that portion of the type
[28:21] you have to go to to revelation 11 and
[28:23] you have to see that that's moses and
[28:25] elijah being killed and 144 thousand
[28:28] being martyred and and and the foolish
[28:31] virgin are all martyred
[28:32] revelation 11 15 because then the second
[28:35] woe is over and the third woe cometh
[28:37] quickly that's the tribulation why is
[28:38] that possible because there's now no
[28:40] more god's family in the earth they've
[28:42] all been taken from the earth and
[28:43] there's no more blood and there's no
[28:45] more family and now the tribulation can
[28:47] come in
[28:48] that easy it makes sense to you so so so
[28:51] don't don't get tripped up and think oh
[28:53] well i guess i guess it was all oh
[28:56] nonsense it's not you just have to place
[28:58] it correctly
[29:00] so
[29:01] we grope for the wall verse 10 like the
[29:04] blind
[29:05] and we grope as if we had
[29:08] no eyes we stumble at noonday is in the
[29:10] night and are in desolate places as dead
[29:13] men go to verse 13 in transgressing now
[29:16] watch these next uh four verses real
[29:18] close
[29:19] verse 13
[29:22] in transgressing and lying against the
[29:24] lord my do we see that today
[29:28] that's really
[29:29] don't read ahead of me but that's really
[29:31] where i'm the real burden on my heart is
[29:34] that somebody's got to contend with the
[29:37] lie
[29:38] that's being told about god
[29:41] the lie that's being told that this is
[29:44] what god is like this is how you please
[29:46] him this is how you get born again and
[29:48] there's a big lie the greatest
[29:50] existential threat
[29:52] to humanity is not north korea or china
[29:56] or russia it's denominationalism
[30:00] that is the greatest existential threat
[30:02] that humanity faces that's the big lie
[30:05] because
[30:06] denominationalism leads you to the mark
[30:09] of the beast
[30:10] and in the mark of the beast you don't
[30:12] come back from that there's no
[30:14] recovering from that
[30:16] amen
[30:17] so in transgressing and lying against
[30:20] the lord and departing from our god
[30:24] speaking oppression and revolt
[30:27] conceiving and uttering from the heart
[30:29] words of falsehood
[30:31] and judgment is look at this judgment is
[30:34] turned away backward
[30:36] and justice standeth afar off for truth
[30:40] is fallen in the street and equity
[30:43] cannot enter
[30:47] yea truth faileth and he that departeth
[30:51] from evil maketh himself a prey and the
[30:54] lord saw it
[30:57] and it displeased him that there was no
[30:59] judgment
[31:00] now you're coming to isaiah 60.
[31:03] now god's starting to get involved watch
[31:06] and he saw that there was no man
[31:08] and wondered that there was no
[31:10] intercessor
[31:12] see therefore
[31:13] his arm brought salvation unto him and
[31:16] his righteousness it sustained him see
[31:20] this is the time where the church goes
[31:21] into total darkness the church is no
[31:23] longer his voice remember that she
[31:25] becomes her own voice she kicks christ
[31:27] out
[31:28] amen remember that the sun remember
[31:31] under the trumpets the sun doesn't shine
[31:33] the stars the moon and and brother
[31:35] branham shows us in in revelation
[31:37] teaching on revelation that that that
[31:39] now they kicked christ out and the moon
[31:42] the church is no longer giving off his
[31:43] light and the stars sons of god sit in
[31:46] churches but their lives are no
[31:48] different from the rest of the world
[31:50] amen
[31:51] and so so you realize this is what's
[31:53] happening god sees there's no more
[31:55] justice the church has kicked me out
[31:57] there's nobody to declare the truth
[31:58] anymore and so god begins to say i gotta
[32:01] go do something about this now watch and
[32:04] and he saw that there was no man and
[32:06] wondered that there was no intercessor
[32:08] see they they they don't even have
[32:10] access now they've they've brother
[32:12] branham said the church cannot go in the
[32:15] rapture in its condition and as if that
[32:18] wasn't bad enough it gets worse he said
[32:21] and it can't get any better
[32:23] you can't get worse than that you can't
[32:25] go in a rapture like you are you can't
[32:27] improve why because you kept christ out
[32:30] the only one who could make you better
[32:33] and so he says there he saw there was no
[32:35] man and wondered that there was no
[32:37] intercessor see now all access to the
[32:40] token is being lost in the earth
[32:41] therefore his arm brought salvation to
[32:44] him why would he do that because he had
[32:46] already promised himself a bride
[32:48] hallelujah and if the church wouldn't be
[32:51] that then he would send a prophet and
[32:53] draw a people out of the church
[32:56] that's what you're a part of here today
[32:59] it's not just i come to a church my
[33:01] parents make me come here i've heard
[33:02] about elijah probably no friends this is
[33:05] far bigger than that
[33:08] this is prophecy unfolding in real time
[33:10] happening around you
[33:13] and his righteousness has sustained him
[33:16] for he put on righteousness that
[33:17] breastplate and a helmet of salvation
[33:19] upon his head he put on the garments of
[33:21] vengeance for clothing and was clad with
[33:22] zeal as a cloak see now watch the
[33:25] tribulation's getting ready to come
[33:27] verse 18 according to their deeds
[33:30] accordingly he will repay
[33:32] uh fury to his adversaries recompense to
[33:36] his enemies to the isle to the islands
[33:38] he will
[33:39] repay recompense so shall they fear the
[33:43] name of the lord from the west and his
[33:46] glory from the rising of the sun
[33:49] now watch verse isaiah 60 just a verse
[33:52] or two away
[33:53] this is what's happening there's a glory
[33:55] coming from the west at the rising of
[33:58] the sun when the enemy shall come in
[34:00] like a flood the spirit of the lord
[34:02] shall lift a standard against him and
[34:05] the redeemer
[34:06] shall come to zion see and unto them
[34:10] that turn from transgression in jacob
[34:12] saith the lord now that's the same as
[34:14] isaiah 4 and brother branham picks that
[34:17] up i i have the quotes but i'm not going
[34:19] to take the time to read it today but
[34:21] when you go back to isaiah 4 you find
[34:23] zion and the jews so brother branham
[34:26] said zion is always the bride and and
[34:29] then it's jerusalem includes the jews so
[34:31] now it's his gentile bride and when the
[34:33] gentile bread leaves the earth the eagle
[34:36] anointing lifts flies east picks up two
[34:38] prophets goes to the 144 thousand
[34:42] amen
[34:43] and then and then
[34:45] in revelation 11 after 14 they they kill
[34:47] them they lie in the streets but on the
[34:49] third day they're resurrected and
[34:51] they're all brought up you see them
[34:52] again you see them in in revelation 15
[34:55] standing you see those standing with the
[34:57] song of moses the the 144 thousand you
[35:00] see those standing with the song of the
[35:01] lamb that's the unwise virgin who don't
[35:03] get to go into the millennium
[35:05] say well why are they both in the same
[35:07] verse why why did the 144 thousand get
[35:10] to go up but the but the foolish virgin
[35:12] don't because the 144 000 received this
[35:16] same message they received this same ego
[35:19] anointing they received this same token
[35:22] they received this same new birth
[35:24] this very message that you're rejoicing
[35:27] over today they're going to rejoice over
[35:29] it friends
[35:30] the foolish virgin missed the millennium
[35:32] because they rejected
[35:34] the message which was a bleeding word to
[35:36] cleanse their sins
[35:38] they had a testimony of christ but they
[35:41] refused the bleeding word but because
[35:43] you're the
[35:44] the word is what washes us clean
[35:47] it is the word that brings perfect faith
[35:49] amen it's the word that's helped to all
[35:51] your flesh amen
[35:53] so faith comes by hearing in the word so
[35:56] you want rapturing faith
[35:59] three people
[36:00] you want rapturing faith
[36:03] how would you get it without a rapturing
[36:04] word
[36:06] because faith comes by hearing the word
[36:08] see
[36:10] so so so you find then that brother
[36:12] branham says it's not so here's the same
[36:14] thing in isaiah 59 you've got zion the
[36:17] bride and you've that turn from
[36:19] transgression and jacob so now you've
[36:21] got again the same picture that brother
[36:24] branham deals with i might i might give
[36:25] you the reference to the quote i have it
[36:27] in my notes but this is the this is the
[36:30] backdrop
[36:31] of isaiah 60.
[36:33] the world has gone into this condition
[36:36] and it didn't happen accidentally
[36:39] you see when
[36:41] when you okay i'm just gonna try to jump
[36:44] i i'm i'm not really i'm a little bit in
[36:46] my notes that reference is the future
[36:48] home if you want that the future home of
[36:50] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[36:52] bride brother branham talks about isaiah
[36:55] 4 verse 5 and in that day seven women
[36:57] shall take a hold of one man you're
[36:59] familiar with that saying we'll eat our
[37:00] own bread where on apparel let us be
[37:02] called by thy name take away our
[37:03] reproach and brother branham said that's
[37:04] the end time see isaiah 4 is the end
[37:06] time we're living now marriage divorce
[37:09] prostitution whatever see it's
[37:11] interesting brother dale smith was
[37:12] telling me but then i were talking about
[37:14] this how brother dale did a study to
[37:16] show that the divorce rates in the
[37:18] united states stayed at less than one
[37:20] percent for for a hundred for more than
[37:22] a hundred years they started tracking it
[37:24] in the 1800s and started bringing it
[37:26] forward and it stayed at like 0.0746
[37:31] and then right after the turn of the
[37:33] century it kind of went to zero point
[37:36] one four nine two still less than one
[37:39] percent and by the time it got to world
[37:41] war two and there's where brother
[37:42] branham picks that up
[37:44] brother man says by the time it got to
[37:45] world war two it went vertical it was
[37:48] straight up
[37:49] and brother brown talks about how that
[37:51] that so much percentage of the boys who
[37:53] went to fight got dear john letters
[37:55] within the first six months
[37:57] and do you know when it peaked do you
[37:59] know when marriage and divorce do you
[38:00] know when divorce peaked in the united
[38:02] states 1977
[38:06] it reached its zenith
[38:08] and then it started to decline you know
[38:09] why because they stopped getting married
[38:12] they just didn't get married so the so
[38:15] the divorce rate started falling because
[38:16] people are just living together now
[38:19] and and and now the the whole
[38:20] destruction of the nuclear family is
[38:22] even being desecrated i mean the the
[38:25] whole world is in sick insanity
[38:28] it's in the sickness of the mind that
[38:30] isaiah 59 tells you they're like blind
[38:32] men walking around
[38:34] and there's no justice there's no
[38:36] intercessor the church has kicked christ
[38:38] out and god looked upon that and said
[38:40] but i've got a bride i've got a heaven
[38:42] i've got a family i got names on the
[38:44] book and so he clothed himself
[38:47] hallelujah he took on zeal and put on a
[38:50] cloak of righteousness and he said i
[38:52] will come down and what has happened
[38:54] from the rising of the sun the glory
[38:56] will come from the west and arise shine
[38:58] bride thy light has come
[39:02] this is going to lead you to the
[39:03] millennium and the millennium will lead
[39:05] you to the new heavens and the new earth
[39:10] this is the reality that we're facing
[39:14] now now you can see that
[39:16] if when you when you
[39:18] i love studying i love preaching the
[39:20] book of revelation because that's really
[39:21] the bride's book
[39:23] it is truly makes for fantastic bible
[39:26] study and so i've i've been actually in
[39:28] a in a bible study
[39:30] where where it's a call-in goes all over
[39:32] the country to the west coast up into
[39:34] canada and everywhere different places
[39:36] people are catching it myself and a team
[39:38] of other brothers we've been doing a
[39:40] verse by verse study
[39:42] on the entire book of revelation be
[39:44] releasing it soon uh in in a in a uh in
[39:47] a study guide
[39:50] not here to sell that does not for sale
[39:51] at all but but we're just studying it
[39:54] and
[39:55] it is the bride's book
[39:57] because i mean it's you don't even find
[39:59] paul quoting from it because paul is
[40:00] already gone john comes back
[40:02] john's last one to die
[40:04] so he comes back from the island and you
[40:06] don't even find commentators commenting
[40:08] on the book of revelation until you get
[40:10] into the early writings of the nicean
[40:12] fathers and irenaeus starts commenting
[40:15] and different ones start commenting on
[40:16] it but but it's a it's a book for the
[40:18] bride of the last day
[40:20] because it's going to it's it's going to
[40:23] give her you know uh
[40:25] a synopsis and even a a breakdown of of
[40:29] everything that's happened that's why
[40:30] brother branham would say you know the
[40:33] the the after the first three chapters
[40:35] it's a revelation of jesus christ it's
[40:37] god working down in the seven lampstands
[40:40] getting a bride through seven church
[40:41] ages and at the end of chapter three the
[40:44] bride goes up and the gospel goes to
[40:46] israel and you don't see the bride again
[40:48] until revelation 19 and that's 100
[40:51] accurate from from from after chapter
[40:53] three the whole book is to israel and
[40:56] and so you say wait a minute what what
[40:58] about chapter five and brother brandon
[41:00] preached that in the breach in chapter
[41:01] 10 and that's the mighty angel and
[41:03] there's revelation 10 7 and a bride
[41:04] eating the book and and what about all
[41:06] of that of course see there's where
[41:08] brother branham said that's that little
[41:11] interval that's what the theologians are
[41:13] missing
[41:14] they can look at the book and go the
[41:15] bride leaves in chapter three
[41:17] now the book is to israel and what
[41:19] they're
[41:21] what they're missing
[41:22] they're missing that little interval of
[41:24] time that god would come down between
[41:27] the sixth and seventh seal and sixth and
[41:28] seventh trumpet and he would send down
[41:30] elijah into the earth and redeem a bride
[41:33] call her out of a church a church called
[41:36] out of a church and that's what they
[41:38] don't see
[41:39] and that's why brother branham said
[41:40] chapter five he's showing you he took
[41:43] the bride up in chapter three now
[41:45] chapter five and chapter four by
[41:47] extension because they're the same event
[41:49] he's showing how he pulled it off
[41:51] oh my the mighty god moved among us at
[41:55] the end time
[41:56] and what did he do we see chapter 5 open
[41:58] up and the scene opens up in heaven and
[42:00] a strong angel is there and john is
[42:03] representing the bride and he cries out
[42:05] whose word they let him take the book
[42:07] and john is weeping until a theophany
[42:09] says to him don't weep john it's all
[42:12] good jesus is one and there's a message
[42:15] to come and you're part of a great
[42:17] movement
[42:18] and then john said oh i was rejoicing
[42:20] and everybody heard me screaming and
[42:22] shouting
[42:23] that's why we rejoice and scream and
[42:25] shout because we realize our names were
[42:27] on that book
[42:30] and we see ourselves perfected we see
[42:32] ourselves when when you
[42:35] when you when you you look into
[42:36] revelation 8 1 and you see that silence
[42:39] in heaven so what's what's happening in
[42:41] the seventh seal is god revealing the
[42:44] mighty god unveiled catches a prophet if
[42:47] you go back and you distract
[42:50] you and it's not hard it's not
[42:52] complicated you know to to to teenagers
[42:54] i would say listen oh it is it's mostly
[42:57] history when you look at the ages you're
[42:59] seeing a lot of history and the prophet
[43:01] just placed it all and and you see the
[43:03] history say what's the value of that one
[43:05] value is to show you history wasn't an
[43:07] accident
[43:09] the
[43:11] monarchs and kings of the world thought
[43:12] they were making decisions they don't
[43:14] know they were just puppets they were
[43:16] just following god already prophesied
[43:17] what would happen in their history
[43:19] before they were ever born
[43:21] thousands of years before they came on
[43:23] the earth and did and did that what we
[43:25] now call history jesus prophesied of it
[43:27] in his earthly ministry
[43:30] and and and so you find the seals
[43:32] overlaid because each of those
[43:34] historical ages had an anointing from a
[43:36] seal that came upon it and we all know
[43:38] it's elementary to us that white horse
[43:40] rider and a red horse rider and a black
[43:42] horse rider and a pale horse rider
[43:44] coming at the end and there's a lion and
[43:46] there's an ox and there's a man and
[43:47] there's an eagle and each one the the
[43:50] the lion rises up to meet the white
[43:52] horse and the the the ox rises up to
[43:55] meet the red horse and the man the
[43:57] wisdom of man rises up to meet the black
[43:59] the black horse and then the pale horse
[44:01] is a conglomeration of all three and the
[44:03] eagle anointing is a conglomeration of
[44:05] all those previous it's all of the lion
[44:08] and all of the ox and all of the man and
[44:10] and now it has a special anointing on
[44:12] this hour to do what has never been done
[44:14] to god's family
[44:16] that's where we are see
[44:18] and the trumpets are just the same thing
[44:21] for israel just tracking them through
[44:23] history that's why brother branham
[44:24] didn't take a lot of time on he said
[44:25] it's just to israel it's not even to us
[44:27] but we were involved in the history of
[44:30] it
[44:31] part of those trumpets is world war one
[44:33] world war ii a lot of gentiles died in
[44:36] world war one and world war ii
[44:39] so you understand all it is is a weaving
[44:40] of history
[44:42] and it hits flawlessly
[44:45] flawlessly
[44:46] you go back and look at it and and
[44:48] remember the that the trumpets and the
[44:50] vials you say oh goodness it's really
[44:52] going to complicate it no it doesn't all
[44:54] it is is the trumpets are partial
[44:56] judgment and working in history that's
[44:58] why it would say
[44:59] this trumpet sounded this angel sounded
[45:01] this trumpet and a third of this died
[45:03] and a third of this a third just means
[45:04] temporary
[45:05] now that's what brother branham taught
[45:07] us in the seals said that a messenger
[45:09] caught it ran with it people gathered
[45:10] and then then the rejection god took his
[45:13] messenger home dropped a temporary
[45:15] judgment on the earth
[45:18] moved to the next stage sent another
[45:19] star gathered a messenger took a message
[45:22] people gathered around it got a
[45:24] rejection took him home temporary
[45:26] judgment moved to the next age
[45:28] easy
[45:30] right it's not hard it's not hard to
[45:32] just keep it all straight and and so so
[45:34] you've got temporary judgments that's
[45:35] why when it that's why brother brandon
[45:37] would show us when it come under okay
[45:39] you you just take let's just start maybe
[45:42] with the
[45:43] with the third with the third uh trumpet
[45:45] these are historical acts
[45:47] on israel
[45:48] god dealing with israel but they're in
[45:50] the earth so a lot of times gentiles get
[45:52] caught up in it and you see a star fall
[45:54] from heaven his name is wormwood and
[45:56] there's a temporary judgment a third of
[45:58] this and a third of that and then it
[45:59] goes to the fourth trumpet and then this
[46:01] begins to happen and then it comes to
[46:02] the fifth trumpet and all of these
[46:03] things all they are is history
[46:06] they were prophecy until they were
[46:08] history
[46:10] and so that's what happened like on
[46:11] sunset mountain it became a setting of
[46:14] history a setting of prophecy see and
[46:16] that's what happened and you you you
[46:18] have a you have a fifth angel sounding
[46:20] and now another star falls from heaven
[46:23] but this time brother branham ties that
[46:24] star back to isaiah that how art thou
[46:27] fallen from heaven o lucifer's son of
[46:29] the morning
[46:30] so now he's falling down to get a key to
[46:32] the bottomless pit and open the
[46:34] bottomless pit brother branham says
[46:36] that's satan so you find that that in
[46:38] history in our recent history that right
[46:42] around the turn of the century you find
[46:44] this star falling satan is now given
[46:46] some extra power to come down and unlock
[46:49] a bottomless pit and release things into
[46:51] the world that have been held
[46:54] oh my friends this stuff didn't happen
[46:56] accidentally
[46:57] and and now now you've you you've got
[47:00] sin running through the world under the
[47:02] fourth trumpet and under the fifth
[47:03] trumpet and sin is getting worse and
[47:05] that's why what we read in isaiah when
[47:08] the enemy comes in like a flood god
[47:10] raises the standard
[47:11] and so if god is going to allow that
[47:14] fifth trumpet to drop down around the
[47:15] turn of the century then he's also going
[47:17] to have some brothers on azusa street in
[47:20] california and he's going to bring a
[47:22] revival of the pentecostal church
[47:25] because the enemy is gaining power god's
[47:28] got to give his bride power
[47:30] oh my friends these things you can't
[47:32] make it up it's not accidents i'm trying
[47:34] to tell you young people the history
[47:36] that you read about in the books god
[47:38] purposed it all and you're here now and
[47:41] prophecy is unfolding in real time and
[47:43] you're in it you're in the big middle of
[47:45] it
[47:47] it's happening around you
[47:50] don't don't be asleep at the switch
[47:52] it's happening rapidly
[47:55] judgment's rising to meet us the only
[47:57] way up is the only way out is up
[48:00] see
[48:02] sure
[48:03] he comes under the fifth trumpet
[48:05] and what is he gonna do
[48:07] you're you're
[48:08] you're gonna find this key to the
[48:09] bottomless pit
[48:11] now this is right at the time of the
[48:12] first woes because he prophesies there's
[48:14] three woes coming
[48:15] woe to the earth you think it's bad now
[48:17] wait till these three woes start
[48:19] and the world war one's gonna come
[48:21] just after the opening of the century
[48:24] just after the
[48:25] fourth third and fourth trumpet sounds
[48:28] fifth trumpet sounds bottomless pit is
[48:30] open what does it do what does it do
[48:33] it it releases
[48:35] a power in the earth and what do you
[48:37] find happening you suddenly you find a
[48:40] crazy man in austria and he's gonna
[48:42] assassinate ferdinand and that's gonna
[48:44] that's gonna be the catalyst to kick off
[48:46] world war one that was demon powers got
[48:48] released
[48:50] starting to torment the earth and and
[48:52] you notice you notice how that the the
[48:55] scorpions came out and they had a king
[48:57] over them whose name was apollyon
[49:00] remember that so this is clearly the
[49:02] devil and you find that they had you
[49:04] know teeth like lions and breastplates
[49:06] and and brother branham said they had
[49:08] hair the bible says they had hair long
[49:10] hair like women and brother brown says
[49:13] that was to torment the women who had
[49:16] cut theirs off
[49:19] and the hair bob
[49:21] women first began to bob their hair
[49:25] around 1912.
[49:27] you think that's an accident
[49:29] that's the key to the bottomless pit
[49:31] spinner the key the pit's been unloosed
[49:33] and demon powers like scorpions and
[49:34] what's happening what's happening right
[49:36] after there war one and why is it why is
[49:38] it tormenting the women who bob their
[49:40] hair because they're gonna suffer the
[49:41] loss of sons and husbands
[49:44] and it's going to go into the first woe
[49:45] makes sense
[49:47] it makes sense it's not hard to follow
[49:50] and and and then the first woe comes and
[49:52] then right after that the first one was
[49:54] passed and two more woes come the bible
[49:56] says and then what happens the sixth
[49:58] trumpet comes and strikes euphrates and
[50:00] releases 200 million demons
[50:02] and what do they do go after hitler and
[50:04] eichmann because the first wall only
[50:07] took israel and drove them out got him
[50:08] out from under the ottoman empire but
[50:10] they just piled up in central europe and
[50:12] started taking over there but god had to
[50:14] get them home because his word had
[50:16] promised him a promised land and moses
[50:18] and elijah weren't coming to europe they
[50:20] were coming to palestine
[50:24] and so under the sixth trumpet he
[50:26] releases the euphrates demons and they
[50:28] go after hitler and eichmann stalin all
[50:30] them and a persecution of the jews to
[50:32] drive him out of europe back into the
[50:33] homeland
[50:34] oh hallelujah friends and now between
[50:37] that sixth trumpet and the seventh
[50:38] trumpet which reveals christ to the jews
[50:40] there was an interval of time that
[50:42] elijah the prophet had to come on the
[50:44] scene hallelujah you think that's an
[50:46] accident
[50:47] when the fifth trumpet is sounding and
[50:50] the and the pentecostal revival is
[50:52] breaking and the demon powers are being
[50:55] released from the bottomless pit and
[50:56] it's happening in europe and world war
[50:58] one is coming god has a little boy under
[51:01] a tree and he's speaking to him don't
[51:03] ever drink or smoke or defile your body
[51:05] when you get older i gotta work for you
[51:06] to do oh this is prophecy friends it's
[51:10] unfolding it's happening we're we're
[51:12] part of that today
[51:16] because that bride goes home
[51:18] and she's gone chapter 10 takes her
[51:21] see and so we we find then that he's
[51:23] going to turn to moses and elijah now
[51:28] can i get to my notes now
[51:31] that was all just background
[51:34] i just need 15 minutes okay we'll hit a
[51:36] pause button we'll pick it up this
[51:38] afternoon
[51:40] so
[51:41] so we find then
[51:44] that
[51:45] where we're establishing in our hearts
[51:49] that life as we've known it
[51:52] has been driven by prophecy
[51:56] there it's not been driven by politics
[51:59] see
[52:03] it's not being driven
[52:05] by the devil
[52:07] he's a puppet
[52:09] god is allowing him
[52:11] god oh god gave him the key
[52:15] to the bottomless pit to unlock it
[52:18] amen
[52:20] because it's all happening in perfect
[52:22] synchronous harmony you can track it you
[52:24] can see prophecy overlaying with history
[52:26] and it hits to right to a t
[52:30] and so
[52:31] so we find then that
[52:33] that this all correlates with history
[52:36] under the trumpets and the seals the
[52:38] seals are mainly dealing it is only
[52:40] dealing with the gentiles and but it but
[52:42] of course the jews are here in the world
[52:43] it's going to affect them too and
[52:45] the trumpets are dealing with the
[52:47] jews but of course the gentiles are here
[52:49] and so we're caught up in world war one
[52:50] world war ii
[52:52] see and so the second woe actually goes
[52:54] all the way through
[52:56] uh the end of uh revelation 11 14. the
[52:59] bible says the second was ended he said
[53:01] wait a minute i thought the shooting war
[53:03] well world war ii was the second woe
[53:04] that world war ii was a consequence of
[53:07] the second woe it was a byproduct of it
[53:09] it was it was an effect the shooting
[53:11] were stopped i mean you say we wait a
[53:14] minute we had v-day i told my church i
[53:16] reminded him i said i saw the picture of
[53:18] the of the marine kissing the nurse in
[53:21] times square we had v-day in japan and
[53:24] and i thought the shooting war stopped
[53:25] sure it did but remember the second woe
[53:28] carries on all the way to the death of
[53:30] the prophets
[53:31] to the death of moses and elijah because
[53:34] men who fought in iwo jima
[53:37] men who crossed the rhine in germany
[53:39] were just a few years later fighting in
[53:41] korean peninsula
[53:43] see remember brother branham told his
[53:45] church he said now he said how many in
[53:47] here back in the day how many of you old
[53:50] timers
[53:51] he said you remember back in the day
[53:53] when i told you these visions in the
[53:54] early 1930s
[53:56] and he says you know how many old-timers
[53:59] remember i told you if you ever see
[54:01] mussolini head go to ethiopia you'll
[54:04] know there'll be no more peace from that
[54:06] point until jesus comes in the
[54:08] millennium
[54:09] and the world since that time since
[54:11] those woes have begun to break out
[54:12] because jesus said there would be nation
[54:14] rise against nation but this was now
[54:16] going to be global
[54:18] this was going to be world war
[54:21] and and and you don't find any peace
[54:23] those world war ii soldiers are fighting
[54:25] in korea and then their sons are
[54:28] fighting in vietnam and then their sons
[54:30] are invading grenada and panama and
[54:31] their sons are fighting in kosovo and
[54:33] their sons are fighting in the gulf war
[54:35] and then their sons are fighting in
[54:37] afghanistan
[54:39] you understand that there's children
[54:42] born in the united states now who have
[54:44] never known america not at war
[54:48] you see there is no peace till jesus
[54:50] comes the woes have already started and
[54:54] the second woe finally runs itself out
[54:57] when the prophets are taken and it says
[54:58] now the third woe cometh quickly why
[55:01] because all of god's family's gone and
[55:03] the armageddon can now set in on the
[55:05] earth oh you don't want to be here
[55:07] friends you don't want to be here during
[55:08] that time you're here today to escape
[55:11] that hallelujah i'm glad we got a word
[55:13] that gives us the ability to escape it
[55:17] and so so so we we come now to
[55:22] to this to this terminology and hence my
[55:25] title
[55:26] the purpose of god's church in the earth
[55:28] paul only refers to one church as the
[55:30] church of god and that's the church of
[55:31] corinth
[55:33] he calls them paul called to be an
[55:35] apostle of jesus christ
[55:37] through the will of god and so
[55:39] socialness our brother
[55:41] unto
[55:42] the church of god
[55:44] which is at corinth
[55:46] now he there's references
[55:48] to the church of god you know paul said
[55:50] i persecuted the church of god and you
[55:53] know he makes loose references but all
[55:55] the other churches he would say unto the
[55:57] saints which be here unto the called and
[55:59] chosen unto under these unto these i
[56:01] right unto thee but only here in corinth
[56:03] maybe and i'm and i'm not here to get to
[56:06] i've been preaching a little series on
[56:07] at home not here to get into the
[56:08] trenches of that today but you know
[56:11] i think that one of the things that
[56:14] that is
[56:15] relevant that we should talk about today
[56:17] is that you know corinth was a troubled
[56:20] troubled group
[56:22] had a terribly conflicted relationship
[56:24] with the truth and with purity there's
[56:26] secret sin going on and even the church
[56:28] is winking at it you see you don't ever
[56:30] want to be a part of a church like that
[56:32] that winks at ungodliness
[56:34] we are called to be sons and daughters
[56:35] of god
[56:36] amen amen
[56:39] and so so we we find that paul felt by
[56:41] them like they were his children even
[56:43] says that that they're like children to
[56:45] him
[56:46] and he loved them he loved the church of
[56:48] corinth and he spent a lot of time
[56:50] trying to help them with their human
[56:53] frailties and
[56:54] weaknesses we all got them don't
[56:56] we but they seem to have needed reminder
[57:01] of who they were and i think that that's
[57:03] a lesson to us
[57:04] that that i think we need to constantly
[57:07] be reminded who you are
[57:10] you're not just a group meeting in a
[57:12] hotel conference room you're the church
[57:14] of god
[57:17] now not the denominational name all they
[57:19] did was take a name onto a building and
[57:21] that became a blasphemous name actually
[57:23] became a name of blasphemy
[57:25] but the church of god is not a name on a
[57:28] building
[57:29] because paul begins to uh we we can
[57:32] observe here in verses one and two of
[57:35] first corinthians one
[57:37] that he says to them that are sanctified
[57:39] in christ called to be saints so there's
[57:41] our first two clues who's he talking to
[57:43] what is the church of god supposed to be
[57:46] a collection of people just
[57:49] or is it those who are
[57:52] who are called to be the church of god
[57:54] who are sanctified in jesus and called
[57:58] in and being called the church of god
[58:01] they're called to be saints see
[58:03] and so
[58:04] so now now we come to this important
[58:07] point because this is a big point
[58:09] that
[58:10] there is there is a great
[58:12] misunderstanding
[58:15] in the minds of the christian world here
[58:18] in the modern day as to what is implied
[58:22] when we use the term
[58:24] the church of god
[58:26] there is there's there's only
[58:28] one qualified voice
[58:32] in the earth
[58:33] that can speak
[58:35] authoritatively
[58:37] only one qualified voice in the earth to
[58:40] interpret what this phrase means the
[58:43] church of god and that's not true
[58:45] because it's the last day and william
[58:46] branham came and we're the bride that's
[58:48] always been true
[58:50] that's always been true
[58:52] from the first voice
[58:55] to the first
[58:56] age of fallen man which was abel
[58:59] in the book of genesis
[59:01] and immediately cain is rejecting his
[59:03] message
[59:04] from the first voice to the first age
[59:08] to the final voice
[59:10] to the final age
[59:12] there's only that voice
[59:14] which is the family of god only the
[59:17] family of god from abel in genesis to
[59:20] the bride going home in revelation
[59:22] there's only one authoritative voice to
[59:25] interpret what is the church of god
[59:29] see
[59:30] it's always been true
[59:33] outside i want to make a couple of
[59:35] statements
[59:37] outside of the voice of god's family
[59:40] down through history
[59:41] outside of god's voice down through
[59:44] history
[59:45] all other voices
[59:48] all along the way to now
[59:52] and there have been plenty of them
[59:54] amen
[59:56] balaam rose up with a voice
[59:58] cora rose up with a voice amen there's
[1:00:00] been all cain rose up with a voice
[1:00:03] there's been all kinds of voices rising
[1:00:05] up trying to interpret god to the world
[1:00:08] but we find out that outside of god's
[1:00:10] representative family sent to the earth
[1:00:13] in time
[1:00:14] all other voices are laced with varying
[1:00:18] degrees of greater and lesser degrees of
[1:00:20] manmade ideology and now here here's
[1:00:24] here's a point to be made it's all been
[1:00:26] crafted and very carefully sculpted by
[1:00:30] god
[1:00:31] so so that by the time we reach the
[1:00:34] final junction of the fall that's where
[1:00:36] we are
[1:00:38] we're at the final junction the next
[1:00:40] move is millennium
[1:00:42] the final junction
[1:00:44] of the fall
[1:00:45] of of god's family and living in a world
[1:00:48] man's 6 000 year
[1:00:51] train
[1:00:52] of living in a fallen condition is over
[1:00:57] and god's about to recycle and
[1:00:59] transition us into the millennium
[1:01:02] and that the curse will be lifted from
[1:01:04] the earth and we'll inherit new
[1:01:06] glorified bodies i'm here to tell you
[1:01:09] the history of fallen man is coming to
[1:01:11] an end we read it in isaiah 60 he's
[1:01:13] going to do away with all of that stuff
[1:01:16] righteousness will rule the world
[1:01:22] and so the last day bride
[1:01:25] have the full measure of the word and
[1:01:27] the word only and that is to say that
[1:01:31] she has no
[1:01:32] man-made contaminants
[1:01:35] nothing mingled of man-made ideology are
[1:01:38] mingled in the message of the hour
[1:01:41] she's been given now thus saith the lord
[1:01:44] zion the bride as brother branham said
[1:01:46] zion is always the bride zion would have
[1:01:49] thus saith the lord or she would keep
[1:01:51] still in other words we don't teach
[1:01:54] anything but the revealed word we we if
[1:01:56] we're not teaching the revealed word we
[1:01:58] have nothing to say
[1:02:00] amen amen so that we neither teach
[1:02:03] nor
[1:02:04] do we live by the contaminated standards
[1:02:08] of the world we don't live by that
[1:02:11] because their understanding of what it
[1:02:13] means to be a christian is contaminated
[1:02:16] we don't follow that we are the real
[1:02:19] version
[1:02:20] see
[1:02:22] so it is the primary purpose then
[1:02:26] of the light we hold
[1:02:29] to shine that light
[1:02:31] to a dying world
[1:02:33] in the midst of the darkest history
[1:02:36] of humankind
[1:02:39] now we've come from isaiah 59 and we're
[1:02:42] in isaiah 60 and we've got the promise
[1:02:45] of a millennium coming and a new world
[1:02:47] coming and god's going to wrap the whole
[1:02:49] thing up but right here and right now
[1:02:52] we're in between what has been and what
[1:02:54] is coming and our greatest purpose for
[1:02:58] being here is arise shine because the
[1:03:01] glory shall come from the west at the
[1:03:03] rising of the sun because god saw that
[1:03:06] there was no man no intercessor that the
[1:03:09] church had kicked him out they'd cut
[1:03:10] themselves off from being born again and
[1:03:12] so he come down oh my god christ comes
[1:03:16] descending in revelation 10 to do what
[1:03:18] to bring an open book to us what is the
[1:03:20] open book it's christ
[1:03:21] it's not a mysteries and symbols and the
[1:03:23] interpretation it's not doctrine the
[1:03:25] message isn't doctrine the message is in
[1:03:27] books and tapes and quotes the message
[1:03:29] is the person
[1:03:30] and the books and tapes and quotes are
[1:03:32] just the vehicle it's a person of christ
[1:03:35] that we're eating upon and you are
[1:03:38] you're becoming what you eat
[1:03:40] we're being changed from glory to glory
[1:03:42] from glory to glory it's changing us
[1:03:45] see
[1:03:47] and so the church then
[1:03:51] is a fellowship of saints in the earth
[1:03:53] who
[1:03:54] who collectively share this common
[1:03:57] purpose to be representatives of god's
[1:04:01] kingdom in heaven
[1:04:03] that's you say
[1:04:04] why did brother aaron start a church
[1:04:06] this is why
[1:04:07] why are we gathering here now oh we got
[1:04:09] a nice place to go no this is why
[1:04:12] here's why you're gathering here's why
[1:04:14] you gather it all here's why the burden
[1:04:16] came on a man's heart here's why you you
[1:04:18] start to gather what is a church the
[1:04:20] church is a fellowship of saints in the
[1:04:22] earth who collectively share a common
[1:04:24] purpose
[1:04:25] what's our common purpose to be
[1:04:27] representatives in the earth to be
[1:04:29] representatives of god's kingdom in
[1:04:31] heaven
[1:04:32] that's why we're here that's what the
[1:04:35] church is hallelujah
[1:04:37] our are we
[1:04:39] so so this puts us now as sons and
[1:04:42] daughters of the king this puts us now i
[1:04:45] mean listen friends
[1:04:46] our our life isn't some some new
[1:04:49] blockbuster movie where they got some
[1:04:50] new superhero our life is not some
[1:04:53] marvel comic book of the latest
[1:04:54] superhero there are superheroes in the
[1:04:57] world but they're the sons and daughters
[1:04:59] of god
[1:05:00] who are impervious to demon power who
[1:05:03] have authority over sin the world the
[1:05:05] devil and the flesh
[1:05:07] that's what the word has brought to us
[1:05:09] in this hour
[1:05:12] our off-world headquarters isn't some
[1:05:14] it's real but it's not on some distant
[1:05:17] star it's in another dimension right
[1:05:19] among us
[1:05:21] oh our deployment is real friends it's
[1:05:23] prophecy unfolding
[1:05:25] in real time all around us you don't
[1:05:27] want to lose sight of that it has a very
[1:05:29] defined and determinate end game
[1:05:32] this thing is being driven with
[1:05:33] precision
[1:05:35] there are no accidents
[1:05:37] coveted wasn't an accident this church
[1:05:39] being here is not an accident you
[1:05:41] sitting here today is not an accident
[1:05:43] you're there there's literally an
[1:05:45] anointing brother branham said when a
[1:05:46] seal is open there's a there's a message
[1:05:49] bound inside the seal and he said when
[1:05:51] the seal is broken the message is
[1:05:54] dropped into the earth and he said then
[1:05:56] down comes an anointing falls upon that
[1:05:59] word to make it live
[1:06:01] and mechanics become dynamics how many
[1:06:03] want to be that today
[1:06:05] see
[1:06:07] and so you happen to be living young
[1:06:09] people
[1:06:11] i i've stood up here and used up most of
[1:06:14] my time just to qualify you for where
[1:06:16] you are
[1:06:18] just to show you where you are in
[1:06:19] history
[1:06:20] to show you what has been what is and
[1:06:22] what will be
[1:06:23] and there's a lot more we can say we
[1:06:25] just barely scratched the surface of it
[1:06:27] see
[1:06:28] but but but it's uh you're you're you're
[1:06:31] living
[1:06:32] during the time
[1:06:34] you are
[1:06:35] the generation
[1:06:37] upon whom the ends of the world have
[1:06:41] come
[1:06:43] as i said earlier you happen to be
[1:06:46] living during the ending the ending time
[1:06:50] of mankind's 6 000 year journey in a
[1:06:55] fallen condition
[1:06:56] all the history
[1:06:58] you read about and all the books
[1:07:02] have all been to get to here
[1:07:07] can you get your mind around that
[1:07:10] all the history and all the books that
[1:07:13] you've ever read was all a
[1:07:16] purpose-driven history controlled by
[1:07:17] prophecy to get to now
[1:07:21] you have arrived
[1:07:23] there's a people of the book
[1:07:26] whose lives came from god
[1:07:28] whose lives are purposed by god
[1:07:31] living out a plan from god he's coming
[1:07:35] to zion and so i would say to you today
[1:07:38] wake up zion thy king approaches
[1:07:42] wake up zion thy king approaches why is
[1:07:45] he coming he's coming to finish this
[1:07:49] he's not stuck in isaiah 60 verse 1.
[1:07:52] he's coming to the end of isaiah 60.
[1:07:55] he's coming to finish this
[1:07:58] hallelujah
[1:08:00] you were elected before the foundation
[1:08:02] of the world to be dropped right in the
[1:08:05] big middle of it all
[1:08:10] brother branham made this statement in
[1:08:11] the church age book he said i wonder
[1:08:14] if we are sufficiently impressed
[1:08:17] with the word
[1:08:19] in our midst
[1:08:22] you see friends there are millions of
[1:08:23] people
[1:08:25] in the world today because of the
[1:08:27] blindness of the sodom messengers
[1:08:30] there's millions of people who take the
[1:08:32] name of christian
[1:08:34] but they're coming up short of
[1:08:35] redemption
[1:08:37] their their even their only chance to
[1:08:38] even get in heaven will be to go through
[1:08:40] a tribulation give their life and be
[1:08:42] judged at a judgment bar that's even
[1:08:44] only chance they've got
[1:08:46] because when you when you say the church
[1:08:48] of god
[1:08:49] now this word is theos in the greek
[1:08:51] church of god i'm i'm really closing i'm
[1:08:53] on my last page
[1:08:55] the this church of god this theos you
[1:08:58] need to understand a little bit of the
[1:08:59] background of this usage of theos
[1:09:03] to the new testament church
[1:09:05] because originally
[1:09:07] this same term theos was used by all the
[1:09:10] heathen nations
[1:09:12] but it was it was
[1:09:14] indicating
[1:09:15] their gods which we know to be false
[1:09:18] gods there has only ever been one true
[1:09:21] god
[1:09:22] you understand that so so this was the
[1:09:25] purpose of israel if you'll notice
[1:09:27] god
[1:09:28] dropped israel down
[1:09:30] right in the middle of heathenism
[1:09:34] every nation around them was heathen
[1:09:36] coming from the flood they had all
[1:09:37] turned heathen
[1:09:39] and god put israel
[1:09:41] pink right in a little track of land
[1:09:43] and set david up on the throne to do
[1:09:46] what to be a beacon
[1:09:48] of who the true god is
[1:09:50] you philistines
[1:09:51] you you you canaanites you've been
[1:09:53] worshipping i know you've been using
[1:09:54] this name god but you've been
[1:09:56] worshipping of false gods there's only
[1:09:58] one god and we're here to demonstrate
[1:10:01] now that's where israel failed
[1:10:04] their whole purpose was to be that
[1:10:06] lighthouse dropped in the middle to show
[1:10:09] the world who god really was
[1:10:12] and what he really required and now
[1:10:14] we've come full circle at the end time
[1:10:16] friends why are you here in when why
[1:10:18] would god leave you here in a time of
[1:10:20] darkness that covers the whole earth and
[1:10:22] men's minds in gross darkness why
[1:10:24] because it's a repeat he's bro he's
[1:10:27] brought a rise
[1:10:28] shine shine
[1:10:31] shine thy light has come now shine
[1:10:34] i've deposited you in the middle of a
[1:10:37] dark world who thinks they understand
[1:10:39] what christianity means who thinks they
[1:10:41] understand who god is they think they
[1:10:44] understand what is the requirement from
[1:10:46] christ after when they have heard about
[1:10:48] his death burial and resurrection they
[1:10:50] have a misunderstanding they're going to
[1:10:53] miss the rapture they're going to end up
[1:10:55] in a tribulation many of them are going
[1:10:57] to end up in matthew 25 and he'll say
[1:10:59] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[1:11:02] and they're going to say but we went to
[1:11:04] church and we built orbiting jesus and
[1:11:05] we did all these things in your name and
[1:11:07] he's going to say but you did it and
[1:11:08] iniquity it doesn't count how are they
[1:11:10] going to know if you're not shining the
[1:11:13] light
[1:11:16] the whole world has a grievous
[1:11:18] misunderstanding
[1:11:20] of what it means
[1:11:22] our lives here friends are to be guiding
[1:11:25] examples to guide others from the
[1:11:28] heathenism and misunderstanding of what
[1:11:31] the true living god is
[1:11:32] and what the true word is this is why
[1:11:34] today i said i really wanted to speak to
[1:11:36] the young people because listen friends
[1:11:38] it's up to you to make clear who the
[1:11:41] true god is
[1:11:45] what he's
[1:11:46] really like
[1:11:49] not the misunderstanding the world has
[1:11:52] but you're here to demonstrate his true
[1:11:56] characteristics
[1:11:58] families and homes and marriages and
[1:12:00] teenagers
[1:12:02] old people young people male female our
[1:12:05] whole life if you've got a if you've got
[1:12:07] a godly home you know what the purpose
[1:12:09] of that godly home to show all the
[1:12:11] people with ungodly homes what a real
[1:12:13] godly home is
[1:12:15] you've got a godly church to show the
[1:12:17] rest of the ungodly churches what a real
[1:12:19] godly church is
[1:12:20] you've got teenagers filled with the
[1:12:22] holy ghost to show the teenagers of the
[1:12:24] world who are stripping themselves off
[1:12:26] and doing every kind of vulgar thing and
[1:12:28] and going to the funerals of their movie
[1:12:30] stars and their basketball stars and
[1:12:32] saying i'm sure he's looking down i'm
[1:12:35] sure she's looking down i'm sorry she's
[1:12:36] not he's not they're looking up
[1:12:38] screaming
[1:12:40] you know why you know why they say that
[1:12:42] at their funerals because that's what
[1:12:43] they believe they have a complete
[1:12:45] misunderstanding of what righteousness
[1:12:48] requires
[1:12:50] and there's no way for them to know it
[1:12:51] unless the body of christ and the earth
[1:12:54] declares it
[1:12:56] and that's the challenge of the hour to
[1:12:59] correct the false narrative the world is
[1:13:02] fed from modern christian pulpits this
[1:13:05] false narrative about what god is to set
[1:13:08] the record straight of what it means to
[1:13:10] be a christian
[1:13:13] not in word only
[1:13:15] but in power
[1:13:17] and in demonstration
[1:13:19] of the holy ghost

[1:13:53] i come with plenty of notes you never
[1:13:55] run out of something to say and i've got
[1:13:57] a burden on my heart something i really
[1:13:59] would like to bring so will you pray for
[1:14:01] me
[1:14:02] amen we'd like to carry on four day do
[1:14:03] you feel challenged today friends
[1:14:06] you understand
[1:14:08] my my goal today was just to lay some
[1:14:11] basic fundamentals just some basics to
[1:14:15] to show you
[1:14:16] wow
[1:14:17] i didn't just end up here
[1:14:19] i'm not just going through life trying
[1:14:20] to figure it out
[1:14:22] your whole life is determinant
[1:14:25] your whole life has a purpose i don't
[1:14:27] care what's happened to you everything
[1:14:28] that's happened to you has been under
[1:14:29] the control of god you say oh you know
[1:14:32] the bad the good the bad the ugly
[1:14:33] whatever listen friends brother branham
[1:14:35] said
[1:14:36] jesus christ
[1:14:38] is in every verse of the bible
[1:14:42] now i used to puzzle over that
[1:14:44] because i would and brother adam said if
[1:14:46] you can't read him in every verse of the
[1:14:48] bible you missed him go back read it
[1:14:49] again
[1:14:50] and i would i'd be fine when i was
[1:14:52] reading about opening the red sea
[1:14:54] sure
[1:14:55] it was all no problem when elisha
[1:14:57] floated an axe head on water and made it
[1:14:59] swim to him
[1:15:02] and they think they've got the force
[1:15:03] they don't know nothing about the force
[1:15:05] elisha working the force thousands of
[1:15:08] years ago
[1:15:09] float an axe head and make it swim
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:13] i had no problem reading christ in that
[1:15:16] but then i came to the sin
[1:15:18] i came to david's
[1:15:20] horrible thing i came to
[1:15:23] the to the failures of god's great
[1:15:25] servants and the failures of god's
[1:15:27] people the failures of samson
[1:15:30] how do i
[1:15:31] how do i read christ in that
[1:15:34] the failure of judah
[1:15:36] goes into a city takes a prostitute
[1:15:38] doesn't know it's his daughter-in-law
[1:15:41] comes back ready to burn
[1:15:43] she she reveals and judah at least he
[1:15:46] was man enough to own it he said you
[1:15:48] know she's been more righteous than me
[1:15:50] how do you read christ into that
[1:15:54] and i was studying that one day and i
[1:15:56] said lord
[1:15:58] you never did any of those things
[1:16:02] and the lord just spoke back to me and
[1:16:03] said yes but you did and i took your sin
[1:16:09] i became guilty so you could become
[1:16:11] innocent
[1:16:13] and brother branham said he who knew no
[1:16:15] sin became sin
[1:16:18] and i want to tell you something you
[1:16:19] might can't read jesus and the failures
[1:16:21] of those people but i can read me
[1:16:23] you can read you
[1:16:24] and christ took that sin and brother
[1:16:26] branham said god judged him as a sinner
[1:16:29] and sent him to hell
[1:16:32] you know why so you'd never have to go
[1:16:35] teenager that's why god sent him to hell
[1:16:38] so you would never have to go there
[1:16:41] amen let's bow our heads
[1:16:45] father we thank you for your word today
[1:16:49] and i feel satisfied in my spirit lord
[1:16:52] that
[1:16:53] you've said what you wanted to say and
[1:16:55] i'm happy to stand here today feeling
[1:16:57] that contentment i'm always checking
[1:16:59] always looking within lord when i come
[1:17:01] to the end of a sermon and i feel that
[1:17:03] contentment and that peace now i can
[1:17:05] close
[1:17:07] i think though the arrow
[1:17:09] of deliverance has found its mark in the
[1:17:11] hearts of men and women here today
[1:17:14] because they can
[1:17:15] they can see you more clearly they can
[1:17:17] see how just how involved you've been
[1:17:20] and in seeing you more clearly they see
[1:17:22] themselves when christ was unsealed the
[1:17:24] bride was unsealed
[1:17:26] that's that's the mystery that the the
[1:17:29] christian church is missing that's why
[1:17:30] they
[1:17:31] that's why the trinitarian doctrine is
[1:17:33] so short-sighted
[1:17:36] that's why the oneness doctrine is so
[1:17:38] short-sighted
[1:17:40] they miss the body of christ
[1:17:42] being part of that godhead
[1:17:44] they missed the expression of his divine
[1:17:47] mate his eternal mate that he that were
[1:17:50] that was purposed in christ before the
[1:17:52] world began
[1:17:55] we've seen you in seeing you we've seen
[1:17:57] us
[1:17:59] we've seen you moving and now we realize
[1:18:00] we need to be moving we see you've been
[1:18:03] in control all along and nothing has
[1:18:05] your control
[1:18:07] and we can't understand all of our lives
[1:18:09] we can't understand our failures and our
[1:18:12] sins we can't understand the things that
[1:18:14] have happened to us sometimes we wrecked
[1:18:16] our own selves sometimes others wrecked
[1:18:18] us
[1:18:20] but regardless of that lord you never
[1:18:22] lost sight of us you never had you never
[1:18:24] lost control you always had your hand
[1:18:27] you always had angels following you
[1:18:29] stalked us until you captured us
[1:18:32] lord i've never been so happy to be
[1:18:34] captured in all my life
[1:18:36] i want to have a fresh surrender i raise
[1:18:38] up my hands today how many would like to
[1:18:39] join me today raise up your hands and
[1:18:41] say lord i want fresh surrender today i
[1:18:43] see what you've been doing i i didn't
[1:18:45] realize i i kind of went a little numb
[1:18:47] the life gets so busy and we forget my
[1:18:49] goodness everything that's been
[1:18:51] happening has been prophecy
[1:18:53] everything that's happening right now my
[1:18:54] life has a purpose my goodness i need to
[1:18:57] get busy
[1:18:58] my life has a purpose in it i'm here as
[1:19:00] part of an epic event this is the
[1:19:02] culmination of everything and i'm right

[1:19:07] lift us up above the shadows lord god
[1:19:09] bring us up into the atmospheres of
[1:19:11] glory

[1:19:14] plan of god and see ourselves arriving
