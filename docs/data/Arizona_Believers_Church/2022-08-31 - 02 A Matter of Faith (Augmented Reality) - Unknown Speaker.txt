TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we're we're going to um this is part two on a subject we started a couple weeks ago called a matter of faith and my subtitle today is augmented reality and so um uh the if you're writing down titles and subtitles you keep track of that it's a matter of Faith part to and um the subtitle augmented reality your mind may be going somewhere with that but I want to kind of turn it around on its head a little bit but this is a a series of services that going to work as a companion to um the Services we're preaching on Christ my healer and as we've looked at the aspects of Christ being our healer and in the initial laying the foundation and focusing on the word of God and what our uh healing is based upon and our different approaches maybe we've spent some time looking at some of the negative approaches that kind of keep us from receiving our healing uh the subject of Faith just keeps coming up over and over again to me and so I want to uh start looking at the subject of faith and I recognize that we're revisiting some of the same principles that we touched on in a few Services last year on blind trust uh uh blind trust bad faith and I'm sure you all remember them perfectly um so it'll be in those moments that you say Amen because you remember it but we're going to be revisiting some of those same things but I think approach it from a different perspective but if you want to go back uh to some of those principles I think they'll be helpful let's look at Hebrews chapter 11 verse1 I was going to read several scriptures from Hebrews uh as my text but I I just want wanted to use that story um of the Canaanite Woman as a background for what we're speaking on and this is a the maybe the most uh obvious um statements about faith because it's defining faith it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen one of the most important things that we have to grab a hold of immediately in this reading is Faith is the substance of things hoped for so it's the the things hope for are things promised by God otherwise you'd have no basis to hope for them so when it says faith is the evidence of things hope for it's not just things you want or things that you hope to come to pass but things that the word of God has declared which creates The Hope or the expectation of it to be and so faith is the substance of things promised by God that you are hoping for and faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen and to say it's the substance it means it has actual existence and that's a that's when we're getting into substance Faith as we might say it something that has actual existence and if it's the evidence it's the conviction of the reality of something though you don't see it and are you picking up on those uh I hope you're entering into fellowship with me on this principle tonight faith is a substance faith is an Evidence and some of the statements we made last time is that and what this verse is saying is that Faith comprehends as a full reality as actually existing Faith comprehends as a full reality what cannot be grasped by our natural senses and we know we have senses that declare to us certain things it's declaring to us whether or not it's hot in this room or whether or not it's cold or whether or not the lights are on those our senses are declaring to us but Faith comprehends the full reality of something that even our physical senses can't declare to us and what we wanted to express last time and we're going to share this tonight I know that I think most of you if not all of you were there is that faith is a new way of since it relates to a sense faith is a new way of seeing it's a new way of interacting in the world that we already exist in it's a new way of living within the natural world I think we use the phrase that Revel Revelation is the upheaval of human thought that you think one way when Revelation comes it turns it around it turns it upside down and so when Revelation comes it changes your thinking and then once your thinking changes it changes the way you see the world and the way that you interact in the world that you still exist in and as faith and we should look at Faith not as just something that is given one time and as just something we refer to but it's something that's ongoing it's something that's transforming us it's something that is a that is living and so Faith or the life of Faith or a living faith the Walk of Faith however you might want to describe it is a a constant uh revolution of our character it's a changing of our character uh in relation to how we view ourselves because we're coming to understand who we are in the word of God but it's a change of your character and how you relate to your neighbor to those among you and it's a change in the way that you relate to the world so faith is something that changes everything in your life and as we use the phrase uh or the term ecstasy in relation to Faith and use some principles in the scripture that show that ecstatic realm that Faith brings you into faith is beyond mental reason faith is beyond the carnal carnal experiences I I would say that one phrase that keeps coming up in my mind a lot is Faith is a new reality and that in it being a new reality there's something Transcendent about it that when it takes place and when it happens it transcends our our natural existence it transcends where we are now and it puts us into a new experience and that's what faith does how about if you disagree with me you say no that way when it's quiet I'll know you agree with me at least and maybe you shouldn't do that but if you disagree with me just say no brother Aaron and I'll just go to the scriptures more and more until we can all say Amen but when we um so then faith is and I want you to really hopefully you're L listening tonight very intently to grasp a hold of this because I really I feel that I'm not bringing anything new but I'm wanting to put an emphasis on this that has been extremely helpful to me is completely changing the way I live it's changing my approach to the word it's changing my approach to Faith and it really feel like it's getting very much more deeper into the things of God and faith and this is very simple but faith is power to live above the world right it's uh it's power power to sense and to know and to act in terms of a supernatural reality so we're living in this world and we're we're not of this world but we're in this world and we've only been given certain ways to exist within this world but faith comes along completely transforms our existence we haven't left this Earth but it changes the way that we relate to it amen changes the way we see the Earth it changes the way we see one another it Chang the way I see myself and so it's an entirely new way of living because I I perceive things different l i sense things differently I and so I act differently in this natural world and I'm doing it according to a different reality that has awakened me right and once it it's if you believed that the world was flat and better not maybe I shouldn't go into the flat earther uh rabbit hole but you you would think and I realize just how unfortunate this is but you would think once you perform the experiments that disprove your belief that the Earth is flat or you see a picture of the Earth and it's round or you see the curvature on the horizon you perform different light experience experiments you say wow this is pretty much proven that there's some curvature to the Earth and you would accept now that I've seen it I can't go back to see it some other way that's just using a natural a natural way of describing how once you've been enlightened to something you can't go back well that's what faith is is it opens up a whole another reality Supernatural so it's not natural it's above natural and then when that charges you you can never be the same right it's referred to as a sixth sense and I think I want to use it in that way probably read some statements tonight that enforce that it is a sixth sense that contacts and knows and perceives uh what is unseen it's a sense that is uh can catch and feel and know something that is invisible to human senses God can move in a way that we can all feel it whether you're a Believer or not amen but then there's a faith in God that senses his presence that senses his nearness senses his will knows his desires and that's what we're talking about in terms of a sixth sense now our subtitle is augmented reality I want to spend a few moments on this um concept of augmented reality I'll talk to you about what it is in the natural brother Travis I was going to maybe hunt you down to just go ahead and give a 10-minute synopsis of augmented reality and how that we can use it in our University Systems and that'd be a perfect thing for Dean of academics to do and we've had some short conversations on even how augment in reality um is it's kind of an emerging technology that's being adopted in a lot more disciplines and a lot more technological thing settings construction and everywhere else and how many have heard of augmented reality raise your hands if you've heard of it and I know all the kids play with it all the time the most simple way to say to augmented reality is when you take the phone you're going to do a selfie and there's a little filter you can put on that makes you look like a dog that's just augmented reality or spider crawl on your neck that's augmented reality so it's overlaying uh something visual or even auditory or some other it's the overlay of some sort of sensory information it could be visual it could be audible uh just some way in a simple way is it's the way of taking what is and then overlaying something on top of it as you view it through technology to enhance the experience and so augmented reality not alternative reality but augmented reality is an enhanced version of the real physical world that's what augmented reality is it's an enhanced version this is how they describe it an enhanced version of a the real physical world so as I mentioned before an example would be overlaying certain digital images um imposed on the physical you're in this physical environment but having a means to Overlay some other digital image on top of that how many remember years ago when Pokemon go just blew up and everybody was finally outside and I remember just how strange it was and I'm trying just to remember exactly when it was my wife and I we went somewhere think it was oh it was with you brother Chris and sister Valerie we' gone to a homeschool commit convention in Houston and one evening we went out for dinner and there was droves of teenagers and just hundreds of people running around this one place and one place to another all running around it was chaotic and it was because this augmented reality of Pokemon go and I don't even know if that's still a thing it might be Pokemon go go now but it was taken using your a mobile device and it would augment the reality take the image and you'd find something digitally imposed on that device to enhance your human existence or your physical experience and whatever you were going through and so augmented reality is achieved through using visual elements it could be used by achieved by using sound or other sensory stimuli but it's technology that generates it and and this is very broad how that they can use it and so objects in the real world this is where there's something that exists in the real world but then you take something computer generated that uh provides some per seal information to you so it's not really there it just takes what's really there and overlays something fake on top of it and so you're able to view it in reality through that technology even noticed now whenever you buy something on Amazon you can choose to view it in your room no matter what it is you want to view those toothpicks in your room you can view them in your room and that's augmented reality it'll take whatever it is you're buying and it presented in some form visually in your room and it's uh and I'm too bad brother Lucas isn't here because I found this definition and I knew this would just really light him up because in augmented reality it it can be across multiple sensory modalities and that's one of brother Lucas's 50 Cent words modalities and it can be visual auditory touch taste and smell it does doesn't have to be visual it could even be smell it could be audio it could be um touch something haptic where there's some sort of feedback these are ways that you take someone's experience and then you provide some input to it to enhance it and this is different than virtual reality virtual reality is entirely different uh where you take a um virtual you create a virtual environment created by computers created by technology and kind of immerse yourself in it and it's more or less a a a removal from the actual physical space into a virtual one and that's why videos of people on VR headsets are so fun to watch because people will literally jump into the wall thinking they've entered into a boundless sphere I remember the very first time and I think the only time I ever put a headset on in in what I was viewing you could Crouch down and when you crouch down there was a there was a table there on in my headset so at my age I needed a little bit of help getting up so I reached out to assist myself in getting up virtually and there was no table there to hold me up even though I could see it with my eyes but that's virtual reality augmented reality takes the existing real world environment takes your existing experience so it's this experience now and then it uses layers of information to enhance it this is a sign this is just the this is just the summary this is maybe what you'd find in a perspectus or someone trying to sell you their augmented reality technology it takes your natural human existence and we're going to augment it we're going to enhance it we're going to make your experience in this life better by using this intervening technology maybe it could be sound it could be feel it's like some of the uh I mean there's there's so many different things I thought of I just didn't want to get lost in the examples but you know what I'm talking about yes augmented reality now that's that's this on the science side but I I want to use this term and I hope that I can use it without losing losing anything but Faith enhances our real world environment amen so here we are in this world existing and we're having a physical experience and we're in this world but Faith enhances this experience by adding a layer of information right so if we're looking at something and they can put something and we're looking at this room and then we could use a technology to Overlay something and then it it's changed it it's added a character it's added a scene uh just like in our you can add a background to yourself when you're on a phone call and it's kind of augmented the reality to put you in a different setting and they can do it with a feel where you're doing something there can be vibration feedback to you um that simulates what you're watching and they could do it with smells now they do it with sounds all sorts of ways to make you feel that your experience is different than what you're experiencing and enhances it and it's the senses that augmented reality uses to be effective and so faith is a sense that is added to our existence that augments the reality that we're living in and whereas alter augmentative reality uses man-made sensory information Faith uses Divine information or mankind want through technology can impose something into the scene um add something to your experience to seemingly enhance it and it's man that has to do that therefore creating uh not necessarily something real but some uh false enhancement it's not authentic I was going to use maybe a title of authentic reality it's really not authentic but it's been augmented just as the world uses man-made sensory inputs to enhance their experience God provides us with sensory input that augments our physical experience augment means to increase or to enhance originally the earlier uses of the word in its atmology means to become more severe or to make larger in numbers 32:14 it's talking about how the the the two and a half tribes are wanting to stay on the other side of the Jordan River and they're saying why would you do this and and augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel and so why would you make it more severe why would you make it to become greater and in the New Testament the word auxano uh it's translated to grow or increase or to grow up and it means to augment and it means to increase or to become to become greater in Acts 12: 24 to me this is the most beautiful summary of the book of Acts the word of God grew and multiplied that word there grew is augmented the word of God was augmented it it increased it became greater the word of God grew and multiplied and this verse is so beautiful to me the word of God grew it it it's it augmented means it's increased or it's multiplied or it's increased and it's multiplied if we could have that verse still up there the word of God grew and multiplied it grew individually right because the word is what it is you can't add to the word you can't take away from the word but the word of God grew that means to the individual it's augmented it's increasing it's growing and it's multiplying corporately so to the whole body to everyone it's the word there's no more than just the word the word can't multiply in the sense that you have the word then you have the other word but it's the word of God grew to the individuals becoming more and more real and it's becoming more and more real to more people so that's how the word of God can grow and multiply and so this is the faith of the first church this is the original faith and faith is when it says the word of God augmented the word of God grew it augmented Faith was augmenting the believer's experience I know this is maybe a unique way of saying it but I think it's very important for us to catch this principle of Faith first before we try to get into some of the other elements of it in Ephesians chapter 4 we talked about how we need to all come into the unity of the faith and and and and giving these gifts that speak the truth it says in verse 15 but speaking the truth in love we all now may grow up into him in all things we all grow up we augment we increase into Christ in all things another place that is used in 1 Corinthians chapter 3: 6 and 7 seven Paul says I have planted apollis watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that WTH but God that augments God that giveth the increase so this is what we mean by augment to to increase uh to become greater and and I I realized that there's a way that we think to augment it's kind of like it's uh that Faith was augmented and so faith faith is becoming greater or God is increasing but there's a recipient of that that faith is augmenting it's being added to Faith is increasing so it's changing something in John chapter 1: 50 it says Jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee this is just a um how powerful the word of God is as we looked at this how that he comes it says oh behold an Israelite and whom there's no guile and and he's kind of he's caught off guard by that and he says Nathaniel saying well you know behold Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus says because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree you believe so notice that what he said this this gift of discernment awakens something to Nathaniel to say this is the Messiah this is the Messiah sign so clearly there's a gift there and and it's and it's of God because the work of God is to believe on him whom he ha sent so when this discernment Works upon this elect seed he now believes that this is the Messiah and Jesus says because I I you manifested this gift before you you believe and he says Thou shalt see greater things than these now why would he see greater things than these because Faith was now working in his life that gift of discernment awakens of Faith he says now he believes and because he believes he's going to see greater things so faith is the augmenting of our reality when you have faith you have an augmented reality it makes us able to see things that other people won't see in Hebrews 11:3 it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so things which are seen were not made of things which do appear now how is it that we understand I I broke this down in my mind to where no matter how you read it it all comes back to Faith you either understand that through faith the worlds were framed or through faith you understand regardless it comes back to Faith it's only by faith that you can understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God and we believe that it was by faith that the worlds were framed by the word of God and there conclusion so that the things which are seen we understand and believe by faith that they were not made by things which do appear in other words by faith we believe that something invisible made the things that are visible so Faith then is going beyond what can be seen it's going beyond the scientific process it's going beyond what can be proven it has a it reaches into something else and says we are all here and by faith I believe that we're here by the word of God now that does take Faith because you can I I believe that if anyone's going to be intellectually honest and they say that they do not believe in God or they're an atheist then and they accept science then they they they must if they accept science they must accept that it a scientific impossibility for something uh to come out of nothing right amen and so if if they believe in science they have to believe that something was already here before something else came and they can trivialize it and say well it wasn't something big it was something really small but whatever it was had to always be and then that's by faith we believe God created the heavens and the Earth as something invisible or unseen and Romans 4:7 17 speaking of Abraham it says as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were so this is the faith of Abraham the father of our faith this is a distinct characteristic of faith can call things which aren't as though they are this is Faith it it actually say well there's no evidence of this or there's nothing showing this but faith says no there is something there is something something to it and he says he would he called those things which be not as though they were and I think it's beautiful how it's written here and we could pull this out even in the Book of Genesis but God said I have made thee a father of many nations it wasn't that God said it was the way it's written here I have made the so Abraham didn't take it even as a future promise he took it as he said he has then he has and that's the faith to believe I have made thee a father of many Nation ations so Abraham could say I am the father of many nations and call those things which be not as though they were speaking of Moses in Hebrews 11: 27 just looking at this uh maybe I did a poor job of setting this up but faith augments our reality and and I'm going to be going further in this and I think you'll understand better uh why I chose this phrasing of a augmented reality but it's through faith that we have understanding of how visible things got here faith is able to call things which aren't as though they are and then Moses by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible so this is what faith is able to do Faith Moses by faith saw Christ amen and it was by faith that he forsook Egypt and go back tonight after we go through this whole uh uh sermon tonight on augmented reality go back and read Hebrews chap 11 and look at Faith from the standpoint of something that the believer possessed that changed the way they viewed the world right and not so much just a an a a dogged determination to hold on to a particular outcome and I'm just I'm just going to hold on to it this way but it was something prior to that this is the first principle I believe of faith is it changes the way that you view the world like faith is not just well I'm going to hold on to this idea that if God heals me I'll become a Christian or that if God gives me this good job I'm going to go in the Rapture if God gives me this girl to marry then I know that he loves me you got to let go of some sort of idea of a faith being a particular outcome that's individualistic to your experience and that Faith first is something that transforms Your Existence in this world that's where Faith begins because if you haven't had that then you're still just a sinner who is making its way through the this world and can benefit by a momentary even an emotional Faith to receive healing on the platform and go home and your life not be a rearranged but when you're born again you begin to experience reality differently than anybody else does except another Christian and so this is what faith is it augments it enhances your experience by adding Divine information to what you're seeing and experiencing in the message perseverance brother Bram says faith finds sources that others don't see is that awesome Faith finds sources that others don't see it's why when you when you write papers in academics you have to provide sources well when you're Faith finds sources that other people can't see what's with all the blank spaces on your uh your bibliography page here well you got to have faith to see them Professor faith find sources that others don't see now if you don't have faith well then there's no need of trying to show it to you because faith can see it faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen Faith sees what the blind people don't see faith is the Sixth Sense five senses are fine as long as they don't disagree with the sixth and that's a very important principle but the six sense is Faith it's the substance of things hoped for you don't taste see taste feel smell or hear but you yet you know it Faith tells you so and it's so sure that it's real that it comes to you a substance not just imagination it's something you have now this it's uh we by using it as a sense and we could use different examples and maybe it might be good to do this at some point of how that brother bam even in the first sermon that we have recorded faith is a substance utilizes different examples to say well how do you know this is orange juice because you can taste it how do you know this a piano because you can hear it how do you know this is a Pulpit because you can feel it and there's ways that our senses declare it to us and based upon that sensory input we know it's something well that's what faith is Right Faith provides us sensory input and therefore we can know by faith something we know by Revelation something that God has disclosed to us and this now this fits right in with what we've been talking about in Divine Healing in Christ our healer he says faith is a substance not just an imagination it's something you have I seen people come on the platform say brother brandom I've got all Faith well what are you doing up here then right so this is he's showing that this is Faith what it translates to and how it changes things and what it really is now as we read in Matthew chapter 15 I just want to refer to this very quickly and how the kadite woman who was had a daughter who was grievously vexed with the Devil came running after him oh Lord son of David and the the disciples you just kind of ignores her he says he answers her not her word and I the way it's written in this particular place maybe she begins to bother the disciples and the disciples say hey can you get rid of her please and he says well I'm not sent but to the house of Israel the Sheep lost sheep of the House of Israel she was a gentile and but yet she still came and worshiped him and he get he's dismissive of her that it's not meant to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and then she just replies true Lord yet let the dogs the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table so she had a need brother bner makes reference to this it's very very powerful he says the reason why you don't have faith is because you you don't really have a need he's making that connection of how that you're not really believing because you don't have a need and that's why sometimes the word of God has to strip us down so much and God has to let us suffer so many things because we have to realize just how needy we are so we could come to that place of asking for Mercy oh God help me it make puts us in that desperation and so this brother Bram in the message perseverant this is from 1962 really it personally enter into this I think it's such an encouraging message for us tonight so this poor woman might have had many hindrances and he's talking about this very story here but her faith didn't have any I thought for sure someone was going to shout think about it she might have had some but her faith didn't you might have some but your faith doesn't we have many hindrances he says but her faith didn't have any you may have a lot of hindrances maybe your doctor says it can't happen but if you've got faith it don't make any difference what anybody else says your faith don't have no hindrance your faith sees it it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen now I want I hope I can impress this upon you this way that in that that literal example brother saying that she had many hindrances but her faith didn't this faith is unseen but she had many hindrances and what she did instead of giving all the credit to the hindrances she just went by her faith that didn't have any and when we experience a hindrance or something seems disconcerting or maybe there's some evidence contrary to what we're believing that's a hindrance but not to your faith in other words you can take something that is a hindrance and instead of applying it to your faith you can tell yourself and believe that faith has no hindrances because With God all things are possible but myself I have hindrances I have this experience I have this diagnosis what the doctor's telling me brother brand one place says it may be true but that doesn't matter to Faith amen says your faith sees it it says substance of things hop for the evidence of Things Not Seen so in that way what I want is I I want to tap into what my faith sees I'm allowing way too much sensory input from all these other things and it's keeping me from being able to lock into that channel where all of a sudden it's like I see it too I see it too I believe it and that's what brother Brown Excuse me that's what Jesus remarks at in Matthew 15:28 oh woman great is thy faith be unto thee even as thou Wilt the faith was greater than all the the hindrances great this great faith is attributed to this Gentile woman oh what a great faith that she would uh that she would believe despite all the obstacles she cries out to him he ignores her goes to the disciples they get fed up with her and tell Jesus to send her away she makes it to him again and begins to worship he says you're nothing but a dog you can't get anything for me she says well I can get the crumbs what would do that faith brother br says in the message perseverance again this is a just a little bit different than the ones we've read before uh and he says this little woman she was a Greek and a sarapan and she had heard about the fame of Jesus now how how does faith come by hearing hearing of the word she had heard of him and you know she might have had a lot of things to hinder her by her being a Greek so just there whatever it was in her life there was a lot of reasons why she could have been hindered a lot of reasons why she could have just accepted yeah sorry didn't mean to bother the rabbi go away he says faith cometh by hearing we know that and she had a lot of things to hinder her but Faith finds a source no other one knows anything about faith finds this source that no one can explain it it's something that you know others can't see it but Faith sees it Faith sees that where the natural eye doesn't see it but the inside eye sees that thing I I cannot emphasize enough that this is just simply what faith is there's a lot of ways that we could supplement that definition a lot of examples we could give there's a lot of other scriptures we could use um even a lot of statements and quotes and even tremendous sayings by other people that kind of tell us what faith is and it's essentially amplifying this thought that it's something that is in you that is very very real that senses things other people can't see I was going to uh touch on it tonight a couple attributes about faith how that faith has to have something that it's towards so there has to be some something that's placed in but it also has something has to have something against it and so there could be all sorts of things against this Faith but Faith sees what everyone else can't see finds a source that no one knows anything about finds the source that no one can explain sees what others can't see am what the natural eye does doesn't see it's an inside eye that sees that thing that's what faith is now if you if your faith isn't seeing anything in particular now that's the characteristics of it though to see things that you can't see in second Kings chapter 6 and the first eight verses it tells the story of some of the prophets and how that one was chopping wood I think it was and the an axe head flew into the the the water and they went and told Elisha Elisha we lost an AE and he says tell me about where iten happened and he chops off a branch and throws it on the water and what does the ax head do floats what's the science in that right and so I I I wanted to read the whole chapter but we could just make reference to it real quick this is just kind of demonstrating this life of faith that Elisha had where something that's contrary to science there's no scientific explanation why doing that would cause the ax head to float and and I'm sure that it's probably been done where science has tried to come up with a hypothesis that if the way of the branch was such and such and if it was thrown at such Force if it had plunged faster than the axe head was going down it could have caused this reverse propulsion and caus the axe head to float back up and they do that so that they can explain it away so that it's no longer Faith but we don't need the explanation we just believe that an axe had floated that's just the end of it we believe that that can happen now here's the the next story is this in verse 8 then the king of Syria wared against Israel and took counsel with his servant saying in such and such a place shall be my Camp so this is his private counsel to his servants and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to that place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the King was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servant so you kind of pick up what's going on the king of Syria is Waring against Israel and he whenever he picked his camp Camp King of the Israel would just avoid it they were always get out of the way of trouble he says will you not show me which one of us which of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none my Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tell the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he's in Doan therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great H and it came by night and compassed the city about these are real chariots real horses this is a real king this is a real Siege right so that morning the next morning verse 15 and when the servant of the man of God this is Elisha's servant was risen early and gone forth Behold a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and this is what the servant sees when he walks outside and a servant said unto him alas my master what shall we do now what caused this consternation what caused him to cry out the fact that he went outside and not only did his eyes behold an army but his understanding told him this ain't good right right he knew this is the wrong Army these are the wrong dudes I'm in I'm in trouble we're in trouble and so he said went to the prophet and said what shall we do and he answered this is Elijah's answer fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them now what did I just wonder I wonder if the servant was a little sarcastic one two one two one two I saw more than two out there Elisha I don't think you understand this isn't a solder on the hill there's more he says no no there's more with us he said who who's the US you're talking about what you have a rat in your pocket who are you talking about there's got to there's more on that Hill than us in this tent and he says this and this and you I know you're familiar with this and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see now what what was Elijah what did Elijah have Elisha rather have to see that that this young servant didn't have he said I open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and what did he see beheld behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha so the enemy had come and set itself against Elisha the servant comes out by natural eyesight in his h human only a human existence that's powered by the five senses of the body and the five senses of the mind he goes out there and sees this Army what he sees with his eyes he can now imagine with his mind that this is certain death for him and Elijah and he says Elijah Elisha help us help us what are we going to do he says oh there's more with us than with them and so he has to pray to open his eyes and when his eyes are open what does he see horse the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha on Elisha's side so in that moment he's able to see what Elisha saw and it's not and I I believe that what this is this is an instance where he is able to see by faith that there were armies there was an Army with elishah that the natural eye couldn't see but God allowed those things to line up so that his reality was augmented to now when he looked at on the hill what was not there before but was there in reality right because he's the god of reality that realm is more real than the one that you or I in God allowed that Dimension to be imposed over the one that the servant was viewing and he augmented his reality and made him see that there were more with Elisha than was with Syria this is this is true and it says in Psalms 34:7 the the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them this the scripture is literally setting forth the principle that in another dimension there are host that surround you in another dimension that the five senses cannot declare brother Bram goes to lyns to talk about the certain dimensions of Life Time and matter and then the fourth dimension he calls it a scientific Dimension and how it it exists it's even existing within this natural realm but it's not perceived through our five senses and how that science is able to use technology to to capture to send things through that medium and and pull things out of it and broadcast it's all part of the Physical Realm that we're in it's but it's an unseen realm there's a realm of faith of the supernatural that faith is the antenna faith is the receiver faith is the sense that can look into that and it and it it changes the way you view things and Angel the angel of the Lord and the host as it's often referred to as the angels of God are around about those that fear Him brother BR refers to the scripture and Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he says the five senses only contacts this world if you had I I trust that um it's only 806 I'm going at a pretty good Pace tonight we might be done uh before Culver's closes and he says the five senses only contact this world if you had no feeling you couldn't feel nothing right feelings wouldn't be nothing to you that would be another world because when he when he uses the scripture and he says that the angel of God are encamped about them that fear him it's in a dimension he said that the five senses do not declare and so the five senses not declaring it it's another world so he's going to just hammer down on this line that if you had no feeling the world the world it's another world where there's feeling it's a whole another dimension he says you know nothing about it if you had no sight what would you what you would look at would be another world you'd know nothing about it so these five senses are the only thing that God lets us loose to now there's another what sense called another one called Faith but by faith you walk up a ladder and finally you can get so high until you break into another world which is vision and there's there there's a uh there's a principle that brother looks at as as far as Faith Revelation and vision and which things are certain and how they work and and they're working in a completely different uh area different uses and different utilities but what he's what he's emphasizing is that sense is what opens up a world to you and if you couldn't see the world of sight is a whole new world to you if you couldn't feel the world of feeling is a whole new world to you if I could just put it this way it's all of the senses as we're able to use them that provide to us the reality that we exist within and some who's colorblind looks at all the same things that you look at but to them it's a world that is without color or certain color spectrums and and when and and so there's there's if whenever that sight is given to them to see the color it changes the world for them and does so in a dramatic way in certain instances and so he's saying that these five senses it's another one that you can on this faith can take you to a place where you break into another world which is Vision there you can see just just like if you never knew what it was you were feeling with your sense of feeling never seen it then your eyes come open and you could see it it would all be it would be all a mystery to that person who never could see it'd be a mystery to him but yet that's it so if everyone here was blind and that was just with that our shared experience we had this common experience of being blind and then all of a sudden someone was given sight to be able to see that's a different world now for that person and it's a to those who remain blind that's what faith is it's another sense that opens up another world so when Paul says we read this last time in Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me now the faith of the son of God first and primarily changes the way that you view the world faith in God is most fundamental level is to accept that a price was paid for your sins and by faith you touch that sacrifice you identify yourself with the blood that shed on Calvary and that's that faith that justifying faith that's going to put you into fellowship with Christ by the new birth and and that's a faith that is manifested apart from you doing anything right you just by faith believed and in believing you felt the Forgiveness of sins and by faith you are to be B you baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ but the the Regeneration by the new birth that is the work of God and that changes except you be borned again you cannot see or understand the kingdom of God and now with an insight into the kingdom of God you begin to look at life differently that's what the faith of the Son of God is primarily at its most fundamental level because that's the faith that Jesus Christ had from his birth even before he did a miracle right so he's at 30 years old he performs his first first miracle but prior to that it was the faith of the Son of God to view the World Through The Eyes of the father I hope that makes sense to you that we think of faith we think of turning water to the wine Faith being able to speak my hair back into existence and Faith being able to grow a couple inches and or whatever Faith might want to lose 40 pounds and I I want real substance Faith to heal my back I want substance faith to claim to claim that job promotion and and we look at Faith as being something that is going to be used in this moment to conjure up a a creation of something out of nothing but faith on its most basic level if it's not working here on this most basic level where you begin to see things differently and live differently and have a life of faith meaning you just live by the faith of the Son of God who loved you and gave himself for you apart from performing any Miracles I just see the World differently now come on Amen brother Bram said in a man running from the presence of the Lord he's talking about Christ he says what could he be but that perfect Immortal God made flesh and dwelt Among Us nothing ever compared with him he lived in a world to himself so Paul says I live by the faith of the Son of God the faith of the Son of God put Christ in a different reality says he lived in a world to himself if you ever Ed that phrase of one of your kids or somebody you knew they're in a world of their own they march to a Beat Of A Different Drummer or whatever it is the phrase that we use because it's like they they just they live on their they kind of live in a world all their own but we see them right here they only have the same five senses that you have to contact this Earthly home and they and they they they have the same capacity whether it be work in certain measures that you know to imagine and to feel and to think those different ways that we process Humanity they're still the same human being with these sensories to to try to work their way in this world but now Christ when he says he lived in a world to himself he did that by faith not because he was mute or blind or lacked sens the senses of feeling or taste he lived in a different world because he had a different reality and now I I I don't want to amplify this but I just want to read it to you this way in John chapter 8:36 says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed that means if the son hath made you free and it makes you free you shall be free in reality right amen now when we look at ourselves and maybe you could think of your own testimony that in the moment that you were set free from the law of sin and death nothing external permanently changed unless at that moment something terrible happened and you burned yourself and had a permanent disfigure fing I'm just saying in that moment that the soul is transformed there's nothing external that is permanently changed is that right we could even say that there's those there's things that permanently change but there things that will change in time and things that could be reverse you could have somebody who a sister who cuts her hair gives her heart to God her soul is transformed in that moment nothing externally nothing that the senses could declare has been changed but something has changed in her soul and then she may begin to let her hair grow out and it can grow out and grow out and that would be the visible evidence of a justifying faith that only God could see on the inside but it's changed the way she sees the world it changed the way she sees herself changed the way she saw the word now her life is coming into Conformity with what faith sees and it may take some time but that life is going to begin to look like what faith sees but things could happen you could lose your hair the hair could get uh uh get shorter just through uh old age or whatever it might be but that doesn't change Faith amen and in that moment where it says if therefore if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free in reality though nothing may seem to change about your physical state your physical wellness your financial ability or even the fact that you may be in prison right but you are free in reality why because that dimension of God is the reality and when that when that Dawns on an individual all though they might see chains in the flesh though they may see sickness in the body they know in reality they're well in reality they're free the faith of the Son of God is to live in a different world now you may have already thought about this statement I wasn't going to use it till I just felt impressed later this afternoon just to include this and I just have one more statement to read to you besides this one and the message everpresent water from the rock we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection now remember how we use that to kind of show that the Ecstasy that Transcendent experience where B was trans now we're there and that's what I was trying to show in that last one is in the spirit on the Lord's day that's the whole of the Christian Life oh to live there though I'm here I have something else I'm operating by and I'm in tune with yeah we talk about getting in the flesh right we ever used that phrase before we get in the flesh that's when we know that we're we're no longer operating under that the we know we're no longer operating in harmony with the nature and character of the word we recognize that well faith is to to be sensitive to and to see and to perceive the nature of God in every scenario in every situation that's why we need to press into it pray for Revelation more than anything because we want that to be the dominant trait the dominant sense he says we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it amen some nice bass waters you know he's saying it he's saying it and I believe it am that settles it the sons of God would create daughters would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have have the power in you to do it if you got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it God is omnipotent you see what I mean the power that's in you will make he says you could speak a world into existence and go live on itlu let this Dawn on you really really sink in you could speak a world in existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can't believe whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean the power is controlled by now I'll go ahead and finish this up but I hope you're really thinking spiritually about this the power is controlled by if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there you can have a lot of hindrances but there's no hindrance to Faith your faith can get away from his faith but the power to go create another world speak it into existence and go live a private life on it is inside of you now that's a part of your faith but that power operates by the law of faith says whatever this key of law of faith that opens up to you it's got to open it up to you so listen if you have the power to create another world and go live on it and live a private life on it you have enough power to unlock a different reality in this world here that you're living in you can you can create your reality right here Create Your Atmosphere you can create something by this key of Faith he says whatever this key of faith can open up to you can open up to you a supernatural reality and you can live in a world to yourself right here in this world because that power never leaves you it's always there and so brother Bram says this in the message perfect Faith you can see a lot of these things I've been pulling from from perfect Faith this last few Services he says Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he said he lived in a world to himself self he lived in a world that no one else knew so was he born of a woman yes did he did was he was he a baby was he a toddler do we see him at 12 years old did he grow and increase in wisdom and favor increased in stature he ate he slept he wept he he suffered hunger he died this is a man who had all the senses that we have he was tempted in all points in like manner that we could be tempted this says a man if we could say all man but also all God and he was here on this Earth it wasn't a a messiah Messianic hologram all right he's here this wasn't augmented reality he's here we handled him we touched them the the writers say that he lived in a world that no one knew about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith and the perfect God in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian that we are we'd be a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand us a Mystic is someone who claims to have insight into Mysteries that nobody else understands so a Mystic somebody who has some sort of spiritual Supernatural Insight that's not available to Ordinary People so they become a wonderment to other people and so he's using this phrase Mystic and so in the strict definition of the word that's exactly what a genuine born again Christian is to somebody who can fully appreciate what a Christian is you become a wonderment Right you become a Wonder because now you have insight into Mysteries not understood by ordinary people who have not been born again he lived in a world of perfect Faith we'd be a Mystic to the world if we lived by Perfect Faith he says the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do it whatever it forbid you you would not do then the people would begin to say you'd be a Mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they are a Mystic that people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch this is the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God he lived in a re he lived in this world with an augmented reality he saw things other people couldn't see right like when he' sit sit around and say well if you could have a superpower what would it be right don't we sit around like adults and as adults and talk about if you could have one superpower and mine would be naps you know just let me if I could just take naps whenever I want but there's uh this that's the kind of superpowers you have when you're 47 years old you want when you're 47 but this this ability of Christ to see things that other people don't see and it's not x-ray vision and it's not imagination but it's Faith it's Faith isight such a beautiful thing I hope you're catching this I hope I hope it's becoming more of a reality to what this life of faith is what a walk of faith is what faith is when you say it's a matter of Faith you're in a whole another world Jesus lived in a world that no one else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they say this when he spoke to them they say this and they said why you talking riddles why don't we don't understand this how could this be they weren't in the world that he lived in but but he's there you see that they they weren't in the world that he was living in but they're sleeping on the same ground they're sleeping under the same Stars they're eating the same bread they're they're sharing in the same physical experience but here he is and it could be said that though they're in the same Dimension as it were he's living in another world this is so Supernatural to me I we take things we take things that are Supernatural like ghost and and these other things that really can't be seen and and can't be experienced and we call them we say that they're Supernatural and those are the things that uh seem to be so fleeting uh people just imagine but here is God in flesh and a man living in a whole another existence while everyone else around him is living in a different one just another plane another dimension I was going to I was going to do it I thought better of it hopefully I won't think better of it next time because I wanted to get into the how brother B talks about we live in these different dimensions and he was calling us this could just maybe wet your appetite he's calling us time space time space time space and at the turn of the century it was a phrase that first entered into scientific language of space time right and they finally here I am getting into it and they finally took our existence and said that we live within uh physically three dimensions and then with Einstein's theory of relativity he introduces a fourth one and it creates this four-dimensional existence that everything that has physical existence exists within space and that's that threedimensional space and then you add this fourth dimension of time and this is science now grappling with with the human existence that exist within space and time and you can move within space but you can't go backward in time and this is kind of what the theory of relativity is it's all really beautiful stuff it's wonderful reading if you want to if you want me to recommend some uh books for you don't ask but um there it's it's really just fascinating because this is scientist grappling with this reality and trying to make sense of how why you might perceive something differently than I do and it's all based based upon where you are in time and where you are spatially to one person well I saw this another person I see that and the theory of relativity is trying to resolve some of these things and they're just theories but they break human existence down into four different dimensions but now there's a whole different one there's a whole another dimension that now takes the one that we're living in and can wrap it all up into another existence I'm here in time I'm here in space I'm within the same three-dimensional existence in physics of everyone else I'm living chronologically in time but I've entered into a Heavenly realm and I'm living in another world right here on Earth see he lived that's it what they weren't in the world that he lived in they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ amen remember the emphasis in the the first part old things are passed away all all things are passed away behold All Things become new it's a it's it's meaning that now there's something so significant that has transformed everything you can say I I've been going to church my whole life but now that I'm born again it's like a new experience I've been listening to the message my whole life but now that I'm born again it's like I'm hearing the voice for the first time come on somebody that's exactly what it was that's how was behold all things became new you say well there still was smoking now your attitude towards it changed now well there was this drink and your attitude towards it changed all these different things everything is new now because you look at it from a different realm says we couldn't he was isolated in any man who has substance faith is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ now how can you be isolated from the entire world unless something has taken you and changeed the way that you interact within it cuz now when you see something your reality has been augmented amen and so you look at something and other people can't see it but by faith you see it that's why if you can begin to let this you can if you could let this become the seed of Faith think about what it grows into saints that if my faith is first just viewing things differently my faith first is living in a realm in a totally different world I'm thinking differently I'm listening differently I'm feeding on different things and that's where we start where does it Grow from there am we it's as if we start on the outside why I just don't feel like I have much faith I just don't feel like I have much faith that God would let me walk on water than I'd believe right and you're you're get you're getting it over into a realm to where it begins with this different world you live in says now you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition now think this is what rapturing faith is just skip a few statements and go to the next slide he says now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now that those who have perfect Faith are a Mystic to others how do you become a Mystic to others because you have Vision that other people don't have you have Insight that other people don't have you see things that other people don't see now I realize in this day and age there's going to be things we see and we believe that the world is going to make fun of and going to mock going to criticize going to make it very very hard as we continue this life to maintain the convictions that we have but when it's faith when it's a matter of Faith you can't deny it any more than you could deny your physical existence now why because that's what this Faith becomes it becomes a a union of another reality to now I only look at this life through faith now there's times when my faith gets away from that faith and I lean more to the the my senses of the imagination and conscience and memory reason and affection I'm going more by all this other sensory input and I've kind of let this stagnate a little bit that's because I've I've taken I'm no longer letting Faith augment my reality do you understand what I'm saying I'm dropping down a little bit and what I need to do is through prayer and through sanctification have my life picked back up into that perch where I can now begin to see things again from a faith persp perspective things start happening in life we get a little bit discouraged we start despairing about our relationships we start despairing about our health we start despairing about our job why does that happen because we kind of get let our faith get away from this and we start living in this other realm and to come back up into a realm of Faith isn't necessarily to say thus sayith the Lord I'm going to be healed thus sayith the Lord I'm going to get a new job but it's to see things from such a complete different perspective that those things don't even really matter anymore you're living in a totally new world well why aren't you worried about another rebate why aren't you worried about another government handout why aren't you worried about the price of cryptocurrency right now I'm looking at things differently buddy you should you should have your reality augmented that's what you need you need to have your reality augmented well how do I get it what do I pay for what should I upgrade my system to you need to get born again then it becomes a matter of Faith praise the Lord oh it's been good to be in church tonight love you very very much thank you for your attention tonight could we stand together
