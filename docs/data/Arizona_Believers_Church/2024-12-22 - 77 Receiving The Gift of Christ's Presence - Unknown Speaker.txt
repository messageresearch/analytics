TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd like to begin by reading a statement um from the church age book and I don't know if my title slide comes before this or after brother John but my title today is receiving the gift of Christ's presence receiving the gift of Christ's presence we took a couple Services looking at the gift of Christ's presence and Wednesday night bringing it to uh a real focus on his promise at the end time but now today we're just using this receiving the gift of Christ's presence I'd like to start with a statement from the church age book and it's I would encourage you to go find this reading I think it's maybe after the salutation now can't recall but it's in the church age book where brother brandham gives that uh pick up your pen and write and um and he kind of edits that and puts it there and kind of grammar ises a little bit from what he did I think it's in spoken words The Original Seed he puts that in um the church age book so in that area there if you read this the entire of that portion where brother's talking about um people with experience and what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is i' I've been inspired in this sermon in particular in that whole passage and this is so this statement here comes from there it says if you leave that word you have left God and that's just the maybe a thesis or a principle if you leave that word you have left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages and this is his presentation I am the word and so Christ expresses this if you want deity in your midst if you want God in your midst then welcome and receive the word again this is Christ presenting himself as he would uh we could say in every age if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't let anyone or anything get between you and that word so there is uh Christ again his expression to all ages and presenting himself this is which I am giving you the word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remembered that so that's that's the presentation of Christ to the age he's presenting himself this is something he's wanting to give that if you have if you're going to have him you have to receive the word that's being presented to you and then brother brandham says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst so those are uh so very all these words Merit some attention and some real focus in there but I want to amplify hopefully at some point today if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word so Christ is presenting himself we could even say he's in in his midst presenting himself but if you really want it you want want this uh presence you have to welcome it and receive it and so brother bradam based upon this presentation he says so I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst to have deity if you want deity you have to do something so he's curious do we want it enough are we sufficiently impressed with it to have it and so that it's based upon these things that we're taking that receiving the gift of Christ's presence and using the the concept of the gift of his presence from the sermon the Queen of Sheba where brother man I said God gives gifts in all generations a gift of his presence and brother Bram says that God in every age has a gift um that declares his presence or presents that word to each age and to try to summarize a lot of different principles together as we're closing this series on the house of the Lord uh the house of the Lord to put it in this language declared God's presence in Israel it was his house it was his dwelling place and so God's presence was amongst Israel in his Temple or in his Tabernacle his Dwelling Place among his people and they would look to the temple say that's where God dwells this is how God is declaring his presence and then when in in Isaiah it was prophesied that a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and his name will be called Emanuel and in Matthew 1: 23 It quotes that scripture and says Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us so Christ now is the temple has foreshadowed Christ as God was among amongst them in a tabernacle now Christ is going to be uh called Emmanuel not that his name would be Emanuel but he'd be called uh Emanuel in that he was God With Us I was reading here recently and it's interesting just how much Scholars and academics you know pouring through text and writings and historical records and there's a book out there and there's different writers who have done this before that say that the uh new in the New Testament the disciples invented a lot of explanations to kind of hide the reality and the truth that Jesus was illegitimate and lest they think that Jesus rotted in a tomb they told they told a story about a resurrection and they've just all concocted this so if your faith can be shaken we'll put out a website there so that you could read all these things a and begin to question and doubt oh Jesus was a fraud and all his disciples made this up um and so instead of it being rumors to try to tear down the truth of Christ it was inventions by disciples to obscure the reality that he was just an illegitimate child of a Roman soldier and because they found this name on a tombstone and they found this in the records They think there might be something to it but here we see a remarkable prophecy a virgin shall conceive will be with child and the child which is brought forth will be God With Us that's his meaning so Jesus Christ declared the presence of God to the Jews we see that remarkable transition at the cross when the veil is rent and God's presence is no longer in the temple but there on The Mercy Seat is Christ bleeding and is representing God's glory and God's Son and The Mercy Seat so Christ was the Temple of God's glory in John CH 2: 19- 21 you see this uh symmetry in scripture Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up then said the Jews 40 in six years was this temple in building and wil thou rear it up in 3 days but he spake of the Temple of his body so Christ is making this connection that here he is a temple he is a temple of God he's the Temple of the father destroy this Temple and it'll be raised up again he's not speaking of the physical Temple but the Temple of his body so Christ himself positions him next to the temple and causes them to consider which one am I speaking of which one is the one that will be Resurrected and raised up in Hebrews chap 9:1 but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building so it's not the Tabernacle in the wilderness made of tents it's not the temple in Jerusalem Made of Stone and it's not even that little room that was uh behind the veil or behind Badger skins or that Solomon erected but it was Christ was that more perfect Tabernacle chapter 10:5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou hast thou prepared me so Jesus Christ represented the dwelling place of God on Earth he is his house he is a tabernacle his body was a temple it was a body that was prepared that as the scripture says where is the place of my rest it was reflected in God the fullness of God dwelling in his son as the shakina glory would have come down and dwelt behind Badger skins between those cherums now now he's in flesh the Bible says in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth as we've covered that quite a bit brings us right to The Mercy Seat where truth and mercy are met together there is the grace of God the word which was God is made flesh in Jesus Christ the word which was before time which is in those preceding verses before verse 14 is quite a recitation and because brother Bram says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh if you don't ever read your Bible you think that would all be verse one and then I remember brother sharing with me one time he was in a hotel hunting uh with some brothers and he grabbed the Gideon Bible and he opened to John chapter 1 he began to read and after he finished verse one he saids there's a misprint in the Bible like what what what is it he goes it doesn't say the word was made flesh it's like we'll keep reading verse 14 the word was made flesh amen that word which was God Before Time Was Made flesh in his son Jesus Christ is became the very manifestation in the full revelation of God and we could say though God was manifested in flesh we even see Philip saying show us the father and it'll suffice us and he says have I been with you so long and you don't know who I am when you've seen me you've seen the father so though it can be the full expression of the word it can still be a secret despite the manifestation it can still be a secret which comes to the promise in this hour when the full revelation of Jesus Christ is to be born into manifestation again in full strength in full measure in the bride and how there can be a secret of his presence a tabernacle a dwelling and a safety in this hour and Pro in his word brother BR said we know that there's a messiah coming and when that Messiah comes he's going to to be the word we had a promise of the gift of Christ's presence in this hour does that mean we're in the Millennium now no does that mean there's no meeting there no there's things that are going to happen but you have to recognize your day and its message and why it had to be Shepherd which I pull in a lot from today he says Christ is the word the anointed word made manifest and if there's any Open Hearts here tonight that don't have that Messiah the real Christmas gift the only real Christmas gift there is that God gave the world and declared it to the World by Shepherds of his lamb the atonement for sin and if that heart is open tonight place in it the Lord the Messiah word of today the Messiah word of today I think he uses a deliberate language Feast of the trumpets he said and how he reveals himself so that we could know our mate the revealed word he says there's uh if he's open up your heart I just like to Echo the words of the that choir make room in your heart says we receive your Christmas gift the Messiah the anointed word that vindicates your presence with us it is the anointed word that vindicates his presence with us we can say Jesus Christ is the Living Word that makes God present that's how we know who Jesus Christ is because Jesus said before Abraham was I am how is it Christ is the Living Word that makes God present how is it that Paul could say have I not seen Jesus Christ my Lord so he's before Christ on Earth and he's after Christ has ascended into heaven how could he say it because Christ is the Living Word that vindicates God's presence or makes God present with us in Psalms 27:4 as we move on I just wanted to share those things God took me a little bit different direction than where we were trending on Wednesday night those are just a few statements uh to consider and Ponder on the Lord revealing himself in this hour and in Psalms 27:4 this has been a key scripture for me as we've studied on the house of the Lord we begin with this in part one on one thing have I desired of the Lord one thing desired David says one thing have I desired of the Lord this was in the time of trouble this is when his enemies were compassed about him to eat up his flesh so with one thing desired he said that one thing will I seek after and here he begins to describe it that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life now his language begins to become uh uh synonymous with the very words of God who said I will dwell between the cheram this is going to be my Dwelling Place among Israel and now David doesn't want to say I was glad when they said unto me let us go unto the house of the Lord he wants to dwell and in the same place that God dwelt to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple here's the one aim here's the one desire God's presence he did not want to live as we mentioned Wednesday night I think it was in a verbo or an Airbnb where the host has left and like and nowadays they have uh some offerings where it's like you can go stay in this famous place where this person stayed or this is so and so's house that's been designed it's their place I even think the uh owner of Airbnb the CEO puts up his place to stay in and so you could stay in there and say wow we're staying in this guy's house but but he's not there right so you're you're not really the kind of guest that he wants to be around but he'll let you use his place for some gas and so it it here he's not wanting just to go to church and and the spirit of the Lord not be there he doesn't want to just go to the house of the Lord and God has vacated it and move somewhere else if God had abandoned that Temple and then went to dwell somewhere else David wouldn't have wanted to be in Solomon's Temple he wouldn't have wanted to be in that Tabernacle he said well tell me where he is that's where I want to be amen so he longed to look into his face because if he's looking in his face that's that's him that's his presence he wanted to and I I I I just feel like there's a there's a language that we could use and try to develop through scripture and statements from the messenger of the hour but if I could say it this way he just wanted to know more deeply a and to be fully known and to fully know him Paul expresses this desire in the New Testament I believe it just marries so beautifully with David saying I've desired this one thing Paul said I I'm determined to know nothing else but Christ I count everything else as dunk but I want to know Christ David one thing have I desired I'll seek after it so uh the a longing a desire something you're seeking I want you to think of this it's not one thing I know God is real but one thing I desired it's not one thing I feel so it's not a um a binary proposition in terms of well you either believe him or you don't or you feel them or you don't but it's one thing desired I desire I long and Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13:12 for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face and this face to face is what David was Desiring something that God said man could not do and survive he says I I want to see him Face to Face Paul says then we will see him face to face for now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known I will know as I am known I am fully known by him and I am possessed by him but I want to I want to know him it's expressed this way in Philippians 3:12 to 14 he says not as though I have already attained either were already perfect notice how closely this fits with 13:12 of 1 Corinthians then I shall know as I am known so he says I I don't speak as one who's obtained but I follow after I desire amen if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I I pursue I desire that I may apprehend Christ as I am apprehended by Christ am even then shall I know as I am already known I am already known but I want to know you the same way I want to apprehend you you've seized me you possessed me I want to possess you Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do this one thing I desire that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple to have an arrangement of Union and intimacy that's permanent and abiding amen amen but one thing I do I forget those things which are behind and reach forth into those things which are before forgetting and reaching forth I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus my title being receiving the gift of Christ's presence I I'm wanting to convey something something to you today that would be of benefit and use to us so let me say this is not merely conviction but this is true faith that exhibited by this Zeal for Christ I Paul having met Christ is not satisfied to Simply tell of his experience having been struck down by the pillar of fire and experienced many miracles he he's not willing just to become uh to recite history and to talk of what he is experiencing that he has some sort of conviction that Christ is real and he's true but Paul rather had a a a zealousness to know him to reach forth and to press he says I desire to be seized by him as he has seized me so it is more than emotion I I find myself I'm a very proponent of the word only and that we are told to only believe so I I I want to use air quotes uh to convey this but it's not just an emotion or belief where there's an intellectual acceptance of something but it's a desire for the word of life aing for his presence a hunger for his presence more than just a belief or emotion if we could say it this way his presence is a longing it it it creates something it it causes something I believe some of the early church writers and I maybe was going to touch on this next Sunday expressed Heaven as a Perpetual longing that it's not just a fixed place that we're going to remember we're talking about heaven on Earth and a home for heaven and those things it's something that we can have now now this is where I think we can transition to some very though it's going to be principle based I think there's some practical things that you could take from this in the absence of a physical Temple wherein David said one thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord and we could say there was a fixed address that David is thinking of in the absence of a physical Temple or Tabernacle what does seeking his face look like what does it what would it mean to pursue his presence and I want to use the example of the Jews when they were exiled from Jerusalem in Babylonian captivity and there was was this dispora even in the Old Testament and when they were exiled from Jerusalem and the temple is being torn and it's in Ruins they established places of prayer and study and these would be called we know as synagogues and it' be the Bess knesset where they would uh s these synagogues where they would gather for the very purpose of called The House of Assembly it's what the Hebrew word means and it' be a place where they gather around their written words the Torah to read and to pray the word of God and pray to God not being able to go to the temple they get they made houses of dwelling houses of assembly now this is an excellent example for even our churches watch how this works in terms of where we are today where they had a physical Temple which would have been the ultimate we could say for us maybe the ultimate is the New Jerusalem or the ultimate is Christ himself when we meet him in the air but in the meantime while we're still here exiled from our the the restoration of everything and the New Jerusalem uh we have synagogues or places of worship that are for the purpose of assembling ourselves together and in Luke 4: 14 15 and 16 this is after his baptism he's now going in the power of the Holy Spirit and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out of Fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues their house of assembly being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read Christ is coming to the House of Assembly he's coming to the place where the Jews had established these in the absence of one Gathering Place in the temple they had established these different places of prayer and study so he comes to the synagogue and the Very image of this is so beautiful here are these places where they would come together to pray to God and study his word and pray for the Messiah and learn of the Messiah and God's prophecies and the restoration of Jerusalem and the restoration of the temple and the one whom the temple pointed to comes into their very church service their House of Assembly and stands up and begins to open up their word and read to them can you just imagine what scene uh was being rehearsed before them no wonder he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he's coming to the very place where these things were meditated on and prayed about and looked forward to much like our churches today in Luke 4: 31-36 same chapter and you you'll find in here uh other portions that relate to this and he came down to capern a city of Galilee and taught them on the Sabbath days we know that it's his custom to go to the synagogue he's going to be teaching them and it says and they were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power it what does it mean it was with power how how did they know it had power so it gives the very next verse and in the synagogue there was a a man so he's in the House of Assembly they had the house of the Lord where God dwelt but now God has come to their house of assembly their Church their synagogue their house of prayer and study and he's teaching the very word of God and then synagogue was a man who had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice this is the effect of the word saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth Art Thou come to destroy us I Know Thee who Thou Art the Holy One of God and Jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him what exposed it the word taught what cast it out the word and the devil had thrown him in the midst and he came out of him and hurt him not this is where they saw that his teaching his Doctrine the words that proceeded from his mouth had power in them Jesus did kick them and punch them and anoint him with oil it was the word that had this effect and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commanded the unclean spirits and they come out I believe we could point to this to recognize why brother bradam said Jesus emphasized the word more than his Works said well he said if you don't believe me for my word's sake believe me for my works but what was it he spoke first the word Jesus didn't walk into the synagogue that day kick open the door said form a prayer line on the right give me some oil and immediately begin to do things he just began to teach the word and bringing forth the word the word had pow demons can be cast out while the word is being preached God's original way for you to receive him is through the word so he emphasized word and then the Miracles followed because Miracles follow Miracles come with it Supernatural healing Deliverance raising of the Dead all sorts of things come first but the emphasis in the order has to be on the word Luke 5:1 17 and it came to pass in a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea in Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them simply where he was teaching where was he teaching in the synagogue so in the absence of a of the temple in the absence of a common place there were synagogues and houses of worship and these places of prayer and study where Christ would visit and make himself known and his power would be made manifest through the word of God and he was there present to to heal them and to deliver them after the destruction of the temple in the New Testament or going forward by Titus the Jews begin to establish houses of study the the how's I think we call them bait midrash bait midrash is it looks like two different words butai in the plural and they houses of seeking they had a place where they would come together and they were called houses of seeking not just a place of prayer not just a place of gathering but a place of seeking where they would look into the Torah they're they're very remarkable things and I've seen some videos on them in the past where they're they're just reading through the word they're reciting scripture but it was a the the the Gen in the Genesis the desire was to look into the Torah and learn about God and the debate uh the word there that's used we get betel and house from it this house of seeking it's used to emphasize the importance of seeking knowledge of God and learning more about God and having understanding of his word reflects the value that's placed upon seeking more knowledge more understanding this continuous learning and Revelation and spiritual growth and that was how they looked to their Torah but we can look to the word of God both both Old and New Testament and say that in this word Christ is making himself real and Christ has revealed himself and Christ is in every verse and so we pray to God and we call upon God for revelation of his word more than anything the sermon Pride brother Bram says scriptures all tied together how the how the Bible means so much more than it speaks if we can only have the Holy Spirit to interpret it for us we only read it as we look down upon it but oh how the holy spirit says child of mine you are looking into my face now when you look into this Bible this is what I want you to know when you look into the Bible you see my face and may the Holy Spirit take the word of God today and deliver it to every heart just as that we have need God is able to again through his word give us what we have need of God is able to through the word bring a power present to heal all of us to deliver us to make himself known and just as Christ came to the synagogue and he began to read and open himself up come to the these houses of seeking Christ is revealed in the same today through his word and so the statement that we want to pull from now for a moment to use this example of Christ coming to the houses of assembly the houses of seeking there has to be an assemblage there has to be a seeking or even if it's not so much in the assemblage but it's that desire to know as Paul said I I want to know David said said one thing I desired if you want deity in your midst notice how brother says this if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word though the Jews could say well we have the temple and God could have said well you have the temple I'm just going to have my son come and he's going to die but he came and he manifested himself he revealed himself he came to their houses of worship and their places of assembly and their place of gathering and seeking they could have said well I'm a Jew and a Jew the Messiah will come and you'll restore the kingdom and everything will be well could have just merely believed it but they didn't just believe it they poured into it they sought it out they looked into it they wanted to learn they taught it they were told in the Old Testament teach these things to your children not just believe them and tell your children you believe them so he said if you want God if you want deity if you want Christ's presence in your midst then welcome and receive the word am it's not just to believe or acknowledge it's more than just an invitation we maybe even ask well what does it mean to welcome and receive the word or how could what does it mean to recognize and receive his presence what would that look like I want to use the example of Luke 7:36 and just read this one verse and then skip to verse 44 and if you to go back and read I was going to maybe use this as our text uh just to kind of put the story in our mind but in Luke 7:36 and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet now I want you to gather in your mind how Simon believe this is Simon who desired him to come Simon the Pharisee and he says I want you to come eat with me I want you to come to my house this is an invitation to Su this is a invitation to feast and to a meal and brother bam says Jesus goes everywhere he's invited and so Christ will come by invitation and one of the Pharisees desired that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet now if we could lean into this a little bit and recognize that the Pharisee invited Christ Christ comes to the house just as he would have been in the house of seeking or in the House of Prayer or in the house of gathering the houses of assembly he would come and now as he has been invited he comes into the house and he sits down to eat but in verse 44 we find out that having been invited having arrived and been present with them that something different is happening there's more layers to this in verse 44 and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon because this woman is is performing a service to Christ and they're all murmuring and mocking and I know I'm skipping a lot here but he says seest Thou this woman I entered into thine house by invitation thou gavest me no water for my feet amen but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to K kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment we can look at this scene and take away from it well what does it mean for me to recognize the presence of Christ in this it today and how is it that I can welcome and receive the word in my day here we can see where the Pharisee had invited Christ to his house Christ had indeed come in the he sat the Bible says he sat down to meet to eat the Pharisees served dinner but he didn't wash his feet he didn't greet him with a kiss he didn't anoint him with oil he didn't refresh him he didn't give attention to him he didn't care for him let me just say this during this holiday time when maybe we invite people over and maybe we can just think about this in our past experience serving a meal to visitors is vastly different in receiving a guest corre you could serve a meal and you could arrive at someone's home and it's merely just a meal that's being served and you're really just there to eat you're kind well this is weird you know kind of showed up it's like well the food's over here and somebody pray and it just kind of you come and you eat and it's kind of like all right we're all done here and you're like all right well see you later hope the cook was good different in how you would have somebody over merely to serve them a meal or receiving them as a guest an invitation is a passive act to a guest come and I some of the sisters saying you know what it means to have a good because you just don't treat them like they did like a Wallflower but just telling someone to come is really a passive act because they say come to my house for dinner you're going to be cooking dinner yes there's something to that but just inviting them over for dinner the meal's going to be there it's a passive act but welcoming and receiving is different inviting and putting on a spread or giving an opportunity is one thing but welcoming and receiving is different just as Christ came to the Pharisees home and Simon let Christ enter and sit down to eat and he's serving him a meal and then there's a bunch of rumors and whispering and gossiping about him he says I entered I'm eating but you didn't wash my feet you didn't kiss me or greet me you didn't my feet with oil that is the hospitality that's receiving that's greeting and and welcoming someone in Acts chap 28:7 just going to be focusing on the last phrase of this verse and the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was puus who received us and lodged us three days courteously to re receive means to to it accept or to receive the word used there receive means to receive and hold one's attention to be kind to one who has come it's a very specific word uh to receive and to entertain is even maybe how it might be described you received us and then lodged us courtly for three days this type of reception requires a a deliberate recognition and welcoming of one where it wasn't just well you know just tell them that there's room in the end or just tell them they can go sleep in the barn or just tell them there's a guest room down the hall but the very one who was a chief man greeted them acknowledged them recognized them gave them lodging and and the he they whether you he held their attention or was attentive to them and therefore our welcoming and receiving the word requires a deliberate recognition of and a welcoming of the word amen they received us as we lodged in Luke Chap 10: 38-42 and now it came to pass as they went speaking of Christ and he entered into a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house here is another example of receiving one but what's interesting is Acts chapter 28 uses a word that means to receive and hold one's attention here of Martha it just means to take in a guest very different word from the receive and hold one's attention the deomi means to receive and to be hold attention here it just means she took him in as a guest this is what Martha did invited them I'm serving dinner come and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus feet and heard his word talking about welcoming and receiving this isn't just Gathering it's not just acknowledging it's not just believing it's certainly not just emotion H but and again I use those things uh a as Polar Opposites to try to get your attention to some things yes the emotion goes with it yes believe only but there's wanting you to recognize something deeper here he says she sat at Jesus's feet to hear his word but Martha was cumbered about much serving she received him as a guest she's focused on the mill and came to him said Lord Dost thou not care that my sister left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me and Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful one thing is desired what this thing will I do that will I seek after and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her and a house in which Christ has come as a guest on invitation as Paul was received and and his attention was held and one we have to welcome and receive the word in our midst Martha had taken in a guest and then was busy about a lot of serving but Mary had received him differently she had welcomed him she had given him some attention to show that your presence here is important this isn't all about the pretense of me being able to cook a good meal this isn't all about me trying to impress you but your presence with me is important that that you have something I wantan to I want to be near you I want to see your face I want to hear your stories I want to hear about your travels I'm reminded of when I was in Uganda the first time or the only time the last time and 204 and I'd preached in several places and went to one place drove several hours and usually you'd show up and get thrown right behind the pulpit preach a few times and go back to your hotel several hours away I remember I arrived at this one place and the pastor invited us into his living room and got us the the best bananas you've ever tasted in your life these small sweet bananas the best come from Africa it sounded like a trumpism and there there is a he sat us down he got us refreshed in fruit and he sat down he just want us to relax take some time and he says so Brothers he didn't have his hand like what kind of offering are you bring he said tell me what you've been ministering in the country and fell and he was like we were valued our presence it wasn't just use us for a service or something but it was receiving us and Martha this may be seem to be kind of some strong language but I want to draw a comparison to Luke chapter 7 Martha received Christ much like the Pharisees did he had him over for a meal and he's probably busy with different host duties and doing different things but Christ sat there as a wallf flower Martha received Christ like the Pharisee did but Mary received him like the woman in Luke chapter 7 CU When Christ entered the Bible tells us she washed his feet with her tee tears she dried his feet with her hair she kissed his feet and anointed them with oil there's a difference between serving and Hospitality there's a difference between inviting and receiving and welcoming there's a difference in saying well we've invited him he's here is't that enough his name's on the building whatever it might be however you might want to try to justify we're message Believers we got a picture of the cloud we got the Hoffman's head of Christ in the Foy all the different Optics and things that we could say we believe the message we press play and Obey we could have a lot of different Manas we might want to use but Martha had having invited him prepared and labored only but Mary welcomed the word she she gave vent to her inspiration she poured herself out to serve him she gave of her all to him and and she's sitting at his feet listening to the word amen in Romans 12: 10-13 as Paul is admonishing the believer to be this way towards one another ought not there be a spiritual application to us towards Christ be kindly affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another not slothful in business he said don't be lazy but be fervent in spirit not sloin business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in Hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospital Hospitality this word given to hospitality is the generosity that is shown to guests the kindness that is given to guests not merely having guests not merely having people over but rather given to as the Bible says in Titus and Timothy about way how a bishop should be given to hospitality or a lover of hospitality other words it's something that is special where they can show themselves kind they show themselves welcoming I'm sure we've all experienced it where we've been invited somewhere but we didn't feel welcomed uh there's there's been times where maybe you've been invited and you're clearly invited but you know you're not welcome so you don't go and you get criticized for not going you I was invited but was I really welcome was I really going to be at home is it really a place where I felt that I would be treated properly that I I would be acknowledged or refreshed or or [Applause] served he says we ought to be fervent in spirit serving the lord this is how the believer ought to be towards the word not slothful but F fervent in spirit a kind affection C towards the word preferring the word given to hospitality means loving to entertain the word entertain means to hold together you say well where where's what's the etymology on that there's that's what what happens when you're entertained it holds your attention the believer ought to be entertained by the word but then there's this concept that if we are going to be hospitable to welcome and receive the word then there's this holding together in a support of it if you want Christ in your midst welcome and receive the word there's a pattern that we can go through in the scripture to see that it's more than just I believe it it's more than just the Em going through the emotions in 1 Peter chap 4: 7 to10 I'm running out of time so I won't give this as much time in detail as perhaps I would have liked to but you'll see how beautifully it fits with Romans 12 not being lazy but fervent and spirit and given to hospitality Peter says but the end of all things is at hand and if there is a generation that could say this with absolute shity it's us be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins these are beautiful beautiful words of encouragement use Hospitality one to another without grudging this kindness this receiving this welcoming this attentiveness to without bitterness without grudging well I invited them over and they never invited me back that's grudging but you do it to show some sort of value some sort of worth if you ever inviting somebody over to your house just so that you would get an invitation back God most likely is just going to cause that Veil to drop down in that person's mind so that they don't do it like I wonder why they never invited me back and if you ever ask they'd be like I never even thought of that what does that even mean right because God just comes wipes that part of their mind out and blocks it so that you could do it without grudging you're doing it without any expectation and return because there's some value to it and there there's some worth there there's a desire towards it use Hospitality one to another without grudging so that that word is the same with that uh given to hospitality there's several other scriptures we could have used about receiving and welcoming and Hospitality it's a very important concept here in the word of God he says as every man hath received the gift now when we say receive the gift I want you to think of it more in that sense of how puus uh received the gift how that it means to welcome and hold attention be held by their they hold your attention you hold theirs it's this coming together this supporting this holding together as many has received the gift if I can say the gift of Christ presence as many has received it even so Minister the gift one to another now that that kind of elevates the stakes a little bit uh no punt on eating but rather that does speak to what is uh in play and what we're to be doing that now I realize that having received the gift of his presence I would like to also when I'm given to hospitality when I'm given to entertaining when I'm given to this fervent ch among ourselves that I likewise would Minister his presence it's telling us that we ought to welcome and receive the word and having welcomed and received the word we ought to minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God what we have received in this hour has come with the pronouncement of Grace Grace what we've received in this hour is that which is perfect there is something that has come that has entered I trust that you have received it for that Christ has been revealed to us to those he said that can receive it amen this receive the gift this is for this is for the young people it it could have actually been translated in modern language receive the Riz because word is charisma and actually caught and seized the Charisma the gift he says attend to it attend to the gift acknowledge it welcome receive it then employ it in Minister it likewise let it have our attention let it be our desire this is what it means to welcome and receive the word so brother B says as Christ says I am the word welcome and receive me if you want me in your midst I'm here but if you want me welcome and receive me amen so brother brandom gives us some greater depth and Clarity says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst sufficiently impressed impressed is a strong influence Upon A positive impact to be deeply influenced by something sufficiently it's to a satisfactory degree in other words it it meets this a standard is something sufficient it meets the standard are we sufficiently impressed again I want to bring you into that kind of that Continuum to be sufficiently impressed it's not just feeling happy or emotional acknowledging or seeing or knowing he's been invited and he's come but it's being gripped by Christ are you sufficiently impressed it's not to say well I'm impressed I impressed he came I am impressed he's here I am impressed I am impressed but rather sufficiently impressed does it meet the standard of what we ought to be Desiring and what we ought to have have you been held by Christ held spell Spellbound have you been seized by him in 1 John 1: 1 to4 these verses here so beautifully pick up on the same theme of John chapter 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with her eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of Life there it is it's more than just hearing and knowing and seeing but now as we've heard them we've seen them we've looked upon them we've handled him taking a hold of it the word of life for the life was manifested with the life which is the light of men and Light which is the life of men for the life was manifested and we have seen it and therefore having seen it received it we bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us notice this stewardship of the gift of Christ that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also have fellowship with us this is in the pattern of first timoth 1 Peter chapter 4 this Grace which has been ministered to us we will also give there's a Grace to be brought to at the revelation of Jesus Christ there's a Salvation to be revealed at the end to those that receive it employ it Minister it give attention to it we declare to you that we you may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full amen joyful full of joy we've touched on this theme in the past when it comes to Christmas that your joy may be full I know this may seem to be semantics but I want to take a different just kind of draw a line between just being happy the emotional side of things the feelings the emotions because happiness is an emotion you'll feel by through Personal Achievement you've accomplished something you've done something you'll experience uh happiness so happiness can be created synthesized even but this the word was written that your joy may be full in Proverbs 1611 that will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more I don't say this so that we would just Mark out any place happy or uh H is used or and say Well only real Joy only real Joy but rather just to express that there is a different level of emotion there's a different level of energy in thy presence is the fullness of joy I I write this to you and I testify of Christ the word of life that your joy may be full not just happiness which can be created not just happiness which seem to be arbitrary arbitrary and hard to predict but a joy a joy which is the state of the Soul when it experiences God's presence The Joy which is the state of the Soul which creates even in some paradoxical way a fullness but yet a desire and a longing for more our experience in our lives should be more than just just acceptance and more than emotion that's maybe the danger when we polarize on those things just believe just believe just believe no no no no no you want to feel you want to feel you want to feel and then we just create this these two po these two Polar Opposites and you got to pick a camp our experience should be more than acceptance if your life becomes merely acceptance you'll always bounce between belief and doubt I'm coming to this is just every I'm leading to this I'm closing so if you've been kind of waiting until I get to my point it's too late but join us now join us now and you'll get something out of this if you've merely believed and you have belief and you're calling it faith and it's an intellectual Faith your life will be defined of these plateaus of I believe and now I'm doubting and you'll vacillate and you'll live between the two if you're experienceing your attitude towards the word of God is one of emotion you'll live vacillating between happiness and sadness boy I felt all good then now I don't feel so good I really wanted to praise then I don't feel like praising now but when we measure ourselves by whether or not we're welcoming and receiving the word there's still yet a binary proposition but it's one that really gets our attention because when it becomes a question of hunger and desire and welcoming receiving you are either seeking or you've become apathetic not a question of I believe and I'm doubting well I think it's true but I don't know if it is or I'm happy and I'm sad but now it's merely are you seeking are you seeking or have you become dull right have you become Melancholy have you become apathetic a Jewish philosopher which I understand in the 1900s I understand was baptized into Christianity before their death is at least the testimony I thought this statement so perfectly summed up what I was trying to express the danger is not lest the soul should doubt whether there's any bread if we could just think of this in terms of hunger one thing have I desired and it's the danger is not believing or that the so Soul would doubt there's any bread but lest by a lie it should persuade itself that it is not hungry and I believe that's where many people have gotten anymore is instead of not doubting sure they just convince themselves there's not any bread they say well we may believe it and we may exist it but I'm not hungry the danger is not the soul that doubts whether there's any Christ but the lie that it should persuade itself that it does not need it nor want it is not hungry for it the danger of the believer is not that we do not that we that we would doubt the word but that our soul would not be hungry for it the danger this hour is not that our souls would disbelieve the message of the hour but rather our souls are no longer longing for it we've tried to position as well are you happy are you excited yeah okay you're in do you believe it yeah then you're in do you doubt well I'm not so sure you're not excited well then I'm not so sure and we put in these camps where we could just be enthused and so we got it we can just be Believers so we got it but I believe the real question is are you seeking it are you welcoming it are you receiving it or have you become apathetic has it merely been distilled down to emotion or intellectualism that can all be sensitized and synthesized and created in the mind or is there something deep within your souls that says I want it I believe in it oh let us not be guilty of doubting that we're hungry brother Bram says in the indictment I've read this several times quoted it many times recently today men walk ignorantly they don't know that's the truth go and find what truth he's talking about in the indictment the crucifixion of Jesus Christ again in this hour they think it's some kind of ism maybe they think it's bromism or something they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation what is it it's not that they don't believe there's the word they don't believe it's bread the living bread of life they just don't they're just not hungry they've convinced themselves it's not what they need they con convince themselves this is not what's been promised they don't dig down deep enough to get into the Spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough they just take it lightly take it oh well I believe there's a God sure he talks about how the devil believes more than even some people profess to believe it he says people just believe it and go on if you look at this in the image of Simon the Pharisee or Martha even in her own house they just invite it invite his presence he's there can acknowledge it can be busy serving this is the danger even of really strong robust churches to find a place for everyone to be a Martha and no one's ever a Mary because they come to church they do this and they do this and they serve they serve they serve the gift and they serve the body and they serve the church they serve the pastor and they're all doing things everyone stays busy as Martha is but they're all encumbered and no one is doing the better part and so you know what the word is what that's the only reason why we're here take the Torah out of the the the houses of seeking what are they therefore might as well play pickle ball right some of the hipsters said yeah and there's just this idea that if you that if we could just stay busy we're just all Martha we're no different than Simon receiving the gift of Christ's presence it's a challenge to your soul today where do you find your bread Joy is the state of the soul that experiences God's presence creates that longing for more I'm not just serving it's being hospitable it's welcoming and receiving I I'm not just inviting but I I I I'm paying attention to I'm entertained by I'm entertaining Christ we it's 11:33 now so I know that we're pushing pushing this a little long I didn't know if I'd even be able to get this far this morning I want to finish with this story of in Genesis chapter 32 verses 22 to 30 brother abam say don't dig down deep enough you know what that means you're going to have to get dirty you have to roll up your sleeves and dig down deep pray enough you're going to Bow yourself to the Earth you're going to humble yourself to God there's a lot that's in this image for us to challenge ourselves to welcome and receive the word to be sufficiently impressed sufficiently impressed does it meet the standard that's required to have him in your midst we can say God go Christ goes everywhere he's invited he's been invited to our churches he's been invited into our hearts he's been invited into our homes but are we are we Simon's and Martha or are we Mary's are we that woman that knelt At His Feet I I want just to consider that because he could be here he could be present but having not been welcomed and received then we're not sufficiently impressed we won't get the benefit we haven't we haven't met that Mark to where he can say he we're unified we're uniting and here in Genesis 32: 22 to30 Jacob has let his family go on before him and he's left alone you know Jacob the heel Grabber The Deceiver looking even at how he slept and he saw that lad he said this is the house of the Lord says and there Wrestled a man this is different in and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day now just it's like he's there and all of a sudden he's wrestling so would have liked the backstory to that but here he's wrestling with the man all night until the sun comes up and when he the man saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the Hall of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him this is quite a strug at this point it's a confusing narrative in story if you don't know what's happening you say oh my goodness Jo Jacob's been attacked in the night and he's been fighting with this man all night and because he uh he can't the man can't get away he he touches him on the hollow of his thigh and he puts something out of joint as a means of trying to get him to let go this is quite a wrestling match and he said let me go for the day breth such a beautiful challenge here I I I I think you you know what's coming but if we could just look at it without the context what a struggle what a fight and then this is where we first get an idea that oh he hasn't been mugged this is not an attacker he's not trying to keep them down until the police come he says I will not let thee go except thou bless me so Jacob knew listen somebody visited him in the night somebody drew near and got close enough for Jacob to grab a hold of them he wasn't happy with him just coming by he wasn't just happy with him being near but Jacob laid a hold of him and seized him and wouldn't let him go all night even when it hurt even when it would change the way he walked even if it was painful he held onto him and he finally said church is over let go of me he said I'm not letting you go until you bless me and then at that he says unto him that's one he's wrestling with says what is thy name and he said Jacob now what was the purpose of this for him to confess who he was I'm a heal Grabber I'm a I'm a deceiver I'm a sinner and since he grabbed a hold of them and wouldn't let him go this so pleased the Lord he said this is now the Lord speaking this is the Angel Lord however you want to look at this he says thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel the children of Israel the Jews the very name that those that established the synagogues the houses of seeking that to whom the temple pertained here's this namesake for these people Israelites you're not Jacob the deceiver The Sinner the one that comes second but Isel for as a prince thou Hast hast thou power with God and with men and Hast prevailed the word Israel is often translated too in the atmology of it even to the Hebrews it means one who wrestles with God one who has formed this relationship this connection with God he won't let go no matter the consequences because the blessing is what's the ultimate that's what we saw in Abraham the union with God his faith with God and the blessing the promise and here Jacob expresses this beautiful Union I'm going to hold on you and I won't let go until you bless me he says I'm going to change your name you won't be jacobites you won't be deceivers you won't be Hill Grabbers you won't be coming in second we're going to change the name of all my chosen people to Israelites one who wrestles with God who's not in a negative sense but one who is uh trying to know him and decease him to grab hold of him to have relationship with him this is why David could express it one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that's why Moses said show me thy Glory it was something thou inherit in an Israelite to it just wasn't a matter well I'm circumcised it wasn't just a matter of the promise was given but we want to see the Messiah we want to possess our land amen this is true Faith true experience and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after my name and notice this and he blessed him there he knew who he was now the one who could give the blessing the one who could confer it upon him and Jacob called the name of the place Pinel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved this experience brought him face to face with God he named it pel because that's the one he was wrestling with it was in the very name that he's given he was willing to dig down deep enough he was willing to get dirty he's willing not to let go wasn't happy just to have them who knows how the the story may be and and I'm not trying to contrive something but perhaps Jacob is just laying there he's building a little fire he's making his bed and a traveler comes and sits down with him and being warmed by the fire and they talk for a little bit and the man gets up to go and Jacob starts thinking wait a minute wait a minute and he constrains him to stay and says Terry and he says no I'm leaving and Jacob says you're not leaving and he grabs a hold and begins to wrestle out why something in him hungered something desired there was something and he wasn't going to let go and the man says let me go and he says I won't till you bless me and it doesn't maybe seem very welcoming and receiving to wrestle but I to me as I thought about this I could just imagine that the angel Lord says let me go in his heart is saying don't let me go Jacob hold on to the last Jacob whatever you do it may seem like I'm running it may seem like I'm fighting it may seem like I don't want you it may seem to be a little distant maybe a little cold but don't stop seeking don't stop longing I may seem far from you but seek my face you may not have heard my voice but seek my face you may think I'm far away but seek my face Jacob Don't Let Go Jacob don't let go I believe we're living in a time when we as Believers don't let go keep wrestling keep fighting keep seeking keep searching to be seized upon by Joy amen not just made Happy not just made intellectual but be seized upon amen amen see him face to face brother Bram and the unchangeable God says and then Jacob all Disturbed and perplexed and in trouble said his wives across the Little Brook went back on the other side in an unexpected place and an unexpected time he melt go met God in an unexpected way what a way to meet God in a wrestling match Brothers you can come to your instruments but it was God regardless of whether he's in a burning bush or a wrestling match it was God the main thing was Jacob think about Jacob he had had dreams and visions and so forth but this was one time he could lay his hand on something and say it's God and he's able to to hold on to it until the blessing come oh if we could do that if we could find a spot where we could see God whether it's in his word wherever it is and recognize it's God and hold on to it until the blessing comes I hope that I'm not getting too far away from my subject of receiving the gift of Christ's presence listen if anybody is wrapping gifts and placing them under a tree or a nativity or have them hidden somewhere what is it all of your little ones are begging to do right now open presence it's not enough just to see it there it's not enough to know that it's been bought it's not enough to have good nice wrapping paper on it in a bow what they want it they want to open it they want to unravel it they want to see what it really is they can shake it they may know that is curiously in the shape of a bike right and they they they may even know this is exactly what I wanted it's shaped like a baseball bat this looks like a fishing pole whatever might be it's not enough to know what it is it's not enough to know what's behind the paper they want it in their hands they want to have it they want to use it oh God help us to think about the wrapped gift that's here who's wanting to be unwrapped he wants us to run to him and to grab a hold of [Music] him he says wrestle it out with God God promised to do it God said if we'd seek we'd find asking it shall be given knocking it'll be open he said every word is true when Jacob got a hold of something that he could look at hold to with his hands and seeing that it was God he would not turn it loose oh if Christendom oh if Believers and message Believers my terms there but oh if christiandom could do that if you can lay your hand on a hold of something that's real catch a vision of God and see his presence and hold on to it until God sends the answer back and the blessing it may not seem to be very welcoming in the context of Jacob wrestling with the Lord but that's what it means to entertain is to hold to hold together and in the image of being seized I am apprehended by Christ I want to apprehend him I want to lay a hold of eternal life I I want to pursue [Music] this give some thought as this year comes to a close of what it means to welcome and receive the word of God and if we could just stand together and in our hearts think about these things I'd like to read one last [Music] statement he says we receive your Christmas gift the Messiah the anointed word that vindicates your presence with us Lord regardless of creed or denomination we find ourselves today the world Fallen apart and here the great Messiah stands with his hands outstretched Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that made the promises that in the last days the church would be so organized till it go into leoda and we see it today Lord what can we do dear Lord what can I do help me and these other Shepherds Lord around the world Shepherds of the word to Proclaim it Lord in this next year help us Lord we pray now I would say all of us who've received the gift are to employ it or to minister the same give us thy love and thy spirit and thy light we dedicate ourselves tonight to Thy word and to thy call in Jesus Christ's name we receive your Christmas gift the word of God made flesh in US and now we are the house of the Lord now we come to the synagogues now we become the word made flesh help us to become the word as we receive the word to welcome and receive it receiving Christ presence let's pray if you desire prayer today if you want to receive him maybe even for some of our young people those who are have wandered far from him you'd say Lord I receive the one true gift Christ today my heart may not be where it should be and I may have backslid I may have doubted I may be doing things I shouldn't do but Lord I'm not living between faith and doubt anymore I'm not living between happy and sad Lord I want to seek you I want to long for you maybe you've become a little apathetic a little bit cold you realize Lord I I'm not trying to be moved more towards faith and belief I'm not trying to be moved toward more emotion but the long of my soul that's really what faith is it's desire it's longing that's what heaven is Lord help me to just wash me Lord of all these things purify my heart that I could Minister your presence I gracious Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads I close our eyes we speak face to face to you I ask Lord that you would receive us yes we offer ourselves to you today as a Christmas gift we give you our hearts Lord it's a it's an offering take it Lord and what a beautiful picture as we receive you as we welcome you as we are offering our hearts say Lord forgive me of my sins I Repent I'm a Jacob and and we're giving ourselves away and we offer ourselves to you you come and we receive you into our hearts [Music] and your word is born once again in a stable as it were behind flesh so father we want to have a longing we want to have a desire for you so I'm asking and I'm praying Lord that you could just wash us and Purge us and that we could act on the least desire today to know you and to serve you and may we be a people that's not so much caught up in semantics and Theology and periods and explanation and intellect or emotion but Lord be a people who are defined as wrestling with you a relationship a longing a desire where what we're looking for and what we're seeking in our in our prayer and our studies and our coming to church is to know you what we're looking for in others in our fellowship is to know you more it's a longing it's a desire not just an affirmation of what we believe and Lord the more we've looked to affirmation or emotion the more we've looked to be affirmed by intellect or affirmed by emotion the further away we've gotten from desire it's made us more complacent it's made us more aesthetic it's made us more apathetic Lord in doing so we become pathetic we fight more with each other than we wrestle it out with you and oh God help us and Shake us and wake us today maybe as you did that night around the fire you got Jacob's attention and something stirred with him and he grabbed a hold of you and he wrestled it out until his name was changed his walk was changed his life was changed and when he crossed that Brook the next day he was different oh God may we be different in this coming year if you would delay until the first may we find that it's not resolutions that made the difference but a revelation a recommittal burning of the old book not a turning of a new page but away with apathy and a rekindling of Desire one thing desired amen bless us today I pray Lord as we commit ourselves to you and we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen is there room in your heart you got to help me sing it kids is there room in your heart is is there room in your heart for God to write his story sing that again is there room is there room in your heart is there room in your heart is
