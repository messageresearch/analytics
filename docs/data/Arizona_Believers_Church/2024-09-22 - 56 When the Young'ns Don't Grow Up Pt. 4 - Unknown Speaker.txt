TRANSCRIPT
========================================
part four this morning of when the young ones youngans don't grow up and I'll give just a little bit of background of where we were at on Wednesday night but when we pose this title uh it's to uh provoke thought and to give us to start thinking about youngans and what is even meant by youngans we might be able to say babes or uh infants or children of Christ or the CH uh kids in Christ however you might want to look at it but when we say uh when the young on don't grow up we're referring to failing to mature uh properly to grow up as one ought to you think in terms of the development of a a natural child that there's certain benchmarks that even the medical community is looking for to know that there's natural progression and development physically and even mentally within a child and so we're just using that as a um a type of what God does for a child of God spiritually and so it it reflects a failure to mature also a failure to reach the potential that one would have that you have uh um certain gifts or certain qualities or certain uh characteristics by nature and failure to reach that potential would be maybe a failure of nurture failure of environment or uh poor decisions in life and it also speaks to fulfilling your purpose as Paul said that we walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called and that we all have a calling yet we're all United together and we have different measures we are to fulfill that purpose we want to fulfill that measure if you've only been given a measure and instead of given a new numeric value let's just say your measure is e uh you want to reach that fullness of whatever that is and that would be hundredfold that would be you reaching your full potential and that's ought to be what our desire in life is is not to be like somebody else but I want to fill up my full potential knowing that if I fill up my full potential I've got a full reward and I don't fall short of of anybody else I I I I fulfill the plan that God had for me and we know that God's will is perfection and if we were if we got together as a committee and we had the uh privilege of interpreting the Bible for everyone else to read we might selfishly say no God God does not require Perfection uh God just wants us confession that's all he wants and we would feel really good about ourselves and we'd go eat tacos right now but we know that God's will is beyond that it's it's Perfection and that there is a sinless Perfection of the Soul through Christ it's a perfect blood it's a perfect uh forgiveness it's a perfect justification but yet there's more to that so that that's why the Bible I say is as big as it is is because God has so much uh in uh so much love for us he's detailed and he wants to have a place in our lives and so there's so much more to the process of coming to know Christ than just that initial work of the Holy Ghost Wednesday night we pose the question well why grow up as you look at the title slide it says when youngans don't grow up uh when the young ons don't grow up it's implying uh you know there's a lot of different things that we could wrestle with but why grow up we looked at how as a child as a young you're an heir and you are an heir of God and not just an heir of God but joint heirs with Christ in Romans 8:17 we could read this and so because you are an heir you are trained to inherit as he says and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may Al be also glorified together this is uh pretty good breadcrumbs for understanding where I'm coming from when I talk about growing up and why grow up because we're children we're heirs and being heirs we have to suffer that we can be inherit we can receive the inheritance and this suffering is not being called names only it's not being persecuted it's not physical suffering alone or some sort of trauma but it is the process of character development and the process of character development also is hearing what you ought to do and humbling yourself to do it uh the process of character development is making mistakes and being corrected and following through so there's a lot that goes into this suffering not just a physical persecution or physical sickness so because we are children we're Heirs of God joint HS with Christ and being heirs we need to be trained we need to suffer we need to have our character developed that we might be glorified together with Christ in Acts 20:32 and it says now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace I just love that phrase the word of his grace which is able to Build You Up it is the word that is able to build you up so there's a Grace that has come uh in your initial regeneration by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this grace is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them that which are Sanctified this buildup it means to finish the structure for which the foundation was laid so when it says build up it means there's some Foundation there what is the foundation salvation the New Birth the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the the the old man dying the new man being awakened being quickened to life that seed being germinated and coming to life and therefore the building up is the finishing of the work that God started in you to build on that Foundation Jesus Christ the author and finisher of our faith and so there is a perfecting process that takes place and it's the word of his grace that's able to build you up or to serve my purpose grow you up and we would I guess I could conclude when Night by saying that being born or being a child of God is more than just being born say born I'm a Child of God now I wouldn't want to take anything away from that because that that's what guarantees you a resurrection that's what guarantees you the Rapture it's it's what permanently gives you a place in the body of Christ but being a child of God not only implies a birth but it also means growing up or perfecting now today I want to continue in that thought and as I've always already been reminded by my family that it's been very repetitious but I've been assured it's been in a good way and so I appreciate that feedback and I want to continue look at growing up from babes to mature Believers and I want to take some time here at the outset to say there's nothing wrong with being a babe and for some of you who calls your spouse babe uh that's just something that you commonly hear every time is babe babe babe babe and you never know if it's a man or a woman but everybody's a babe now if you've got a boo right or a ba I mean everybody's everybody's got some sort of nickname uh uh for for their spouse and babe seems to come up a lot but there's nothing wrong with being a babe and all the Babe said amen right but there's nothing wrong with being a babe in Christ in Luke 10: 211 it says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and H has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight this uh positioning of the wise and prudent versus babes would be like this is the David ver versus Goliath this is the Harvard Professor talking to a canary brain a lot of different ways that you could position this but in this case uh the the one that is being uh put in a peculiar place to not receive the Revelation are those who are WIS in Wise in prudent they're learned they're intelligent they're educated in some ways you can say they already have all the answers they already know everything and so they can't be taught and so he's saying God has hid these things from those who are wise and prudent and reveals them unto babes and so it seemed good in thy sight means this is God's will this is God's plan and the word they babes the the napos is the Hebrew word the Greek word that is used and the Nay there is a negative it implies negation of apos which is to say or to speak so when it says babes it's basically saying unable to speak and as a babe a newborn does not inherently upon birth understand language as a matter of fact when a baby is born they're not born with any sort of innate ability to understand whatever native language their parents were born with you could take a baby that was born uh to Chinese parents who the parents spoke Chinese at Mandarin to be specific and then that baby be raised by uh Spanish-speaking parents and the baby would learn Spanish just as easily as would have Chinese so there's no necessarily innate ability to speak a particular language but the newborns not even be able to understand language initially they have to learn that language and language could be defined as some sort of socially agreed upon symbols uh that convey a meaning and that and human human beings are the only ones that would have a system of language a spoken language like this so babes I'm just using this to make this point that babes aren't able to speak initially and they don't understand language initially so they have to learn it they're still learning value they're gaining knowledge of right and wrong and one of these components is being able to learn how to speak how first of all we can say learn to understand what is being said to them so they can understand instruction they can understand correction they can understand what to do and then it's a process of learning not only to understand language but to say it back and to convey it back I know in our family as our children are being raised there were certain things that they would say and I might instinctively want to correct how they're saying Elizabeth say oh no let them say it it's cute let them say it as long as they can I knowing that eventually they would grow out of it and wouldn't it be funny if they never did but the the idea is they've got to learn to understand what's being said so that they can grow up properly and then they have to also learn how to communicate so when Jesus says he's revealed it un babes he's saying that they they don't necessarily understand language so they have to be taught to understand and then the babes aren't able to speak so maybe they just it just sounds like J gibberish and that stage is cute whenever they're at that stage where it's just blah blah blah blah blah and I've always loved the long stories that are just sounds and to them it's making sense I remember when we had been visiting Europe and we had been in Europe for maybe a week and a half when Jack was the only child with us that traveled and after about a week or so he started talking to us and we realized he was speaking French in what he understood French French to be or German and that's just the that's what a toddler a babe is someone growing up will do and they're trying to mimic they're trying to learn and yet so it's a god reveals the word to babe so I when I say that I want you to see that there's this characteristic except you become as one of these little ones uh you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven so there's a characteristic of being a babe that is precious that there should be no slight against it but yet at the same time the Bible says in Isaiah 3:4 and I will give children to be their princes and babe shall rule over them and nobody in the kingdom was saying yes immediately they understood this to be a negative whoo when your princes eat in the morning your kings eat in the morning and they drink and they satisfy uh uh their pleasure in the morning and they satisfy their spiritual appetite instead of dispensing justice so it says I'll give children to be your princes and babes to rule over you nothing wrong with being a babe but character isn't suited for the position the character of a babe isn't suited to be a prince the of a babe isn't suitable to rule over the people there's something about being a child that's not one that ought to be ruling there's something about a babe that shouldn't be a king so there's nothing wrong with being an infant being a toddler being a child being an adolescent but there's something about those times of life that aren't Fit For A calling or a position says in 1 Timothy 4:2 let no man despise thy youth so there's something precious about being a babe there's something precious about being young and younger than others and being in your youth says of this Youth and Timothy obviously was older than a babe or just a child but says but be thou an example of the Believers in word and conversation and charity and spirit and faith and Purity let no man despise your youth but don't use your youthfulness as an excuse to not become a bear of the perfect will of God it's wonderful to be young it's wonderful to be a a babe in Christ it's great to be a youth but remember that God has called you to be the an example of the word in your life in charity and spirit and faith and Purity so being a babe is nothing to be ashamed of being youth a youth a young and is nothing to be ashamed of nor should we ever despise youngans say this to comfort the young those young in Christ those that uh feel that they're in the early stages of growing that's nothing to be ashamed of don't have to pretend you don't have to try to fit in with the revelated crowd you don't have to try to fit in with everybody who seems to be more spiritual just know where you are in Christ and understand there's nothing to be ashamed of in being young and to those who feel that they're perfect or more advanced or older or adults whatever you might be there do not despise a young don't despise a babe when they're being a babe don't despise the youth when they're being youth a and and I and I would even say if they're making mistakes don't despise them sometimes it's our uh self-righteous indignation which is unjustified towards young people and people that make mistakes that makes their way back harder pushes them out into into the world and doesn't create a place where they feel like they're being nurtured it's like well they just expect Perfection if you don't tow the line you might as well just leave and they might feel just as good being out in the world than to be a hypocrite in your family or in your church and that's no place to be because I would argue it's in the world that they're a hypocrite and they should be amongst Believers being nurtured and the grace being shared so don't despise youth youth are a certain way they think a certain way they have a certain energy we shouldn't despise that for it says in Luke 2: 11 and 12 For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord now the language here that is used by these angels might have suggested some coming forth some manifestation and they might have thought oh wow this is going to be amazing we're going to go see a conqueror we're going to go see a lord we're going to go see a king we're going to see a savior but it says in verse 12 and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger a savior Christ the lord the Messiah and the the first image that anyone ever had of him was a helpless blood covered babe a newborn and these Shepherds would come and they would find their Messiah the savior Christ the lord helpless wrapped and swaddling clothes Lin in a Manger characterized as a babe there's nothing evil about being being a babe there's nothing wrong with being a young it's even how Christ began and Peter says in 1 Peter chap 2:2 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word there's no shame in being a babe there's nothing wrong with being a young one but you should have a desire for the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby this is one of the outstanding characteristics of being an infant or being a babe or being an adolescent is there's a certain diet that you must be have to consume and to feed upon that you may grow says if so be that you've tasted that the Lord is gracious so we are likened unto babes nothing wrong with being a young Christ started out as a bab we all begin upon our new birth as being babes who desire the milk of the word that causes us to increase and grow the same was so for Christ in Luke 2:52 and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man Jesus as a Christ the lord being the word h being deity formed by the very word of God in the womb of a virgin when he was born still went through the process of increasing in wisdom and physical stature and as he increased in wisdom he gained favor with God and man that means God's favor for him grew as the child grew so being a babe God has revealed hidden things to babes babes must learn to understand language napos they don't have an understanding language they aren't able to speak they have to learn speech which is the output of a language system and maybe initially as they begin to speak it's not clear it's intelligible it's characteristic of an infant or youth who doesn't have the dexterity with their tongue and able to speak clearly or the understanding the language but they are re the word is revealed so that they can speak clearly brother bham teaches us in a number of different places I've chose this uh a larger excerpt from trying to do God AER without it being its will this is preached in that sh shareport series around Thanksgiving Day 1965 which I encourage you all who are looking for material or things to read and some devotion things I'd really encourage you to have taken this entire series for forms the inspiration for this part that we've been ministering on he's speaking how words can take on different meanings and how in the early church there was arguments and splits over single words in the Bible he say just like our language the word c use the word c you could mean body of water I understand or many things I I I love VC and you'd say well what are you referring to right and it's kind of the question what's a pirate's favorite letter and everybody says R and it's like no it t the C so it can mean different things it could be a sea a letter sea it could be the ocean it could be to understand or to see something says many things bored to be a Bor to be boring a hole make a walk or you bored me or you paid my board or it could mean many things remember one time we're filling a a question was asked about well they'll get the church board after you and a trying to translate the statement that brother Brandon made into another language and so in the minds of the ones that were reading it English being their second or third language they were thinking that the church had a board you know that they would get after you like a paddle and so there's a lot of meanings to these words it could mean many things and those little vows and so forth Just Chang the whole meaning what does that tell us understanding the language is important in the natural just one letter off I remember when I was learning lingala and uh it was uh there was a St phrase that you could use and I'm not going to try right now because I realize I may make the same mistake is you could say I am your brother and if you just change the inflection just a little bit you're saying I am your witch i h and so there's the fine line between being embarrassed or pregnant in Spanish right so there's there's certain things you got to get right or the meaning completely changes and so it says God wrot he said and so so you'll never do it like that God wrote it like that and all the word is inspired he said that I thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the wise of the wise the eyes of the wise and prudent and were revealed to babes and this is the phrase I really wanted you to catch such as will learn if you read it in the Bible both in Luke and Matthew you'll find that Jesus says hath revealed it them unto babes and many times dozens of times when brother BR quotes the scripture he adds this part part to say such as will learn to convey the sense that babes are those that are able and ready to learn not the wise and prudent we've already learned I already got to figure it all out but this Revelation is for the babes that will learn it's that key phrase such as will learn such as would learn I want you to understand a babe is one who has the potential and the better capacity to learn he says it's a revelation of him as I said last evening will reveal it to babes just skipping down it says God does things in such a strange way to our intellectual thinking that makes it God and he talks about how God didn't go to theologians and so forth and the smart cyesis he had it just right but God went down and got fishermen that couldn't even sign their name and that's what he took that's God he takes something that's nothing he makes something out of it to his own honor there's there's even the sense of beginning with Clay a new Fresh and this phrase he took a chaos and made an Eden it's God and that's what the world is to a baby it's chaos it's unintelligible they can't figure it out the their senses their depth perception everything is just chaotic but then there's a nurturing that takes place and an education that takes place and the whole world is a baby laboratory and they're learning things they're trying to figure things out and this is what God does he takes chaos and makes an Eden so this phrasing babes implies it's inherent to understand that babes who do not have the capacity to understand language nor to speak it God reveals to them so it's say he wants to convey to one whose nature is suitable to learn he conveys it to those that are able and ready to learn that can be trained that can be instructed can grow up right that that they they have the flexibility to grow they're not old in the later stages a a and if you put wine into that it's going to burst he wants wants new he wants it fresh and Ephesians 4:14 it says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and cunny craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive if I could just say this quickly as we'll revisit this scripture here in a little bit the childhood is marked by up ups and downs if you watch one's life and you were able to look at pictures and follow it you'd see different stages in that child's life where they were trying to figure out their identity and figure out who they were and what they wanted to do and and all sorts of hodgepodges of certain things and so childhood is marked by ups and downs I want to be a firefighter no I want to be the president of the United States no I want to be this no I want to be that no I love this I love that I found that one thing that is certainly characteristic of a certain age is what's your favorite yeah everything's got to be a favorite now now that I'm being asked at almost 50 I'm like I don't know do I have to have a favorite and I don't know if you were a fruit what would you be I don't know just start crying and say strong strawberry right you just you just there's some things you just don't figure out and you don't know because when you get to a certain age you're like I don't I don't have a favorite fruit I don't have a favorite color but there's this idea way of identifying yourself and identity and who you are and what do you belong to that's marked by childhood and so there's a certain characteristic of a childhood where they're tossed they're carried about what are they trying to find purpose trying to find identity and then there's also this and I I'm not saying that that's all in itself bad but it's the instability of infancy toddler child uh adolescence these different stages as one grows and as we've mentioned this scripture quite a bit recently 2 Timothy 2:22 flee also youthful lust that means these are lusts that are characteristic of Youth certain desires and passions that one would have as a child things that they really really want to do and things that they want to enjoy and places they want to go things that they want to do and Paul is saying Timothy flee and instruct those to flee youthful lust there are lust that are characteristic of certain ages and I mean literal times of Life of teenagers and pre-teens and those things saying don't follow them don't give in them recognize that there's certain things that are characteristic of Youth like staying up all night right just playing video games all night long not even sleeping until the sun comes up and then being able to sleep till 2:00 in the afternoon you'll find that as you get later in adult life you need your sleep yes you find out I can't do this cuz I pay a heavy price and so there's certain things about the youth this says but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call in the Lord out of a pure heart the very things he says let no man despise your youth but be an example of the believer in these things so he's telling them to flee lust of your youth that no man would despise your youthfulness and in that you convey the wrong things and you express the wrong attitudes and you give yourself over to things that aren't appropriate so just as the word of his grace is able to build us up in 2 Peter 3:18 he says but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there's nothing wrong with being a babe there's nothing wrong with being a young man but to if you've tasted that the Lord is gracious if you one day want to be glorified together if you want to receive a full reward if you want to reach your full potential then we must grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we don't grow in grace to become saved nor do we grow in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ to become Sons and Daughters of God but because you are his sons because you are his daughters you can grow in Grace and in the knowledge of Our Lord nothing wrong with being a babe as a matter of fact he reveals it unto babes such as would learn because this characteristic of one who's been newly born in Christ this season of life in your youth in your singleness in this stage of being a young one just as in the natural a baby's brain is has tremendous capacity neuroplasticity how many want to break out into just a session on neuroplasticity it's this ability to change and adapt to new experiences and the baby and when it's first born this neuroplasticity is always on for a baby this is even good to learn just even as we're raising kids and the baby's brain is wired to try over and over again to master a skill and that's why we would encourage try hard things try difficult things try things that make you uncomfortable try things that you fail at so you can learn this resilience and this perseverance and this grit and you you're okay with being uncomfortable and you encourage that during a particular time where the brain is doing this and as this brain is trying this neuroplasticity is creating these new connections it's learning these learning these processes creates neural Pathways that make this connection they connect and it opens up a new channel and all these things are taking place and it's it's most constant is within the first five years of being born very critical stage of one's development I say that's the time of being a babe and what does God do he reveals it unto babes such as would learn a time when they're able to make connections your Youth and your youthfulness and your singleness it's a time when the right emphasis is so important to emphasize you still enjoy your youth I mean when our babies are born we don't give an aptitude test which one do you want to be you want to be loyal you want to be a lawyer huh we don't we don't do that they kind of let them grow and they let them Comm but we can be teaching them things as they grow and as they develop say emphasize the right things understand we're training them for adulthood we're training them for a future to also be husband husbands and wives and so this learning process is very very active this neuroplasty reveals under the babes this is so in the natural I believe it's also so in the spiritual that how we cultivate how we grow and how we learn in our youth is so critical to our development as a Christian and one thing that's very remarkable during this stage these first five years or when this neuroplasticity is always on or where it remains very active is you can quickly learn thing habits and and then unlearn negative habits and you can unlearn things that are negative and replace them with things that are positive and this is a process that takes place when one is a babe where there's things that are negative that you can quickly teach and discipline and instruct and cause them to unlearn negative habits my wife and I this morning were talking about something in particular we said I and I just said I don't believe it's too late for change even if they are a pre-teen or teenager no matter what age are just have this Faith to believe that we can teach and train and demonstrate the right example so that if there's some neural process some bad habit that there's enough neuroplasticity in their minds and in their brains to be able to grab a hold of something I realize I I say this I guess it just pops in my mind but I remember when um do we do we still use Co do we still say Co do we still say that well I remember when I when I got Co back in 2020 I had such tremendous brain fog I couldn't figure anything out but the day I couldn't do puzzles it's like the it's like a curse I sit there and stare at a puzzle go what's a border piece right and so there's just this brain fog well I realized kind of later on that's just getting old and and so you in your mind you think I I I could figure this out I can figure this out I figure that out and you know everything and you kind of feel sorry for your kids right your silly little kids are never going to learn anything and they just figure everything how do you know that how do you know how do you figure that out what what what you no I'm the one I was around when that was invented I'm Al Gore I invented the Internet how do you know how to use that right but to plasticity the things they pick up on the way they can figure things out it's very very robust well God wants the same thing for us as newborn babes and there's this other Dynamic where we learned all sorts of things in this thing right and then we get 21 years old and we get the Holy Ghost and now we're babe in Christ and he wants us to unlearn bad habits here by a greater neuroplasticity in a spiritual soul and a mind to have the mind of Christ to overcome and unlearn a lot of negative things that we have in our human humanity and so the revelation of the word should be working to mature our thinking and our acting now in Ephesians 4: 7- 11 I hope I can go uh quickly here as we're looking at our text but unto every one of us is given Grace so we want to grow in Grace this grace that has been given to us we want to grow in according to the measure of the gift of Christ so there's some measure of Grace given to us every one of us has given Grace according to a measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith now because of this verse seven is I think very important to understand every one of us given a Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ everyone has a vocation wherewith we are called though there is one God one Lord one baptism one in all of us one Faith one f one hope your all these things that we share this Oneness all of us are given a Grace according to a measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men let's just skip to verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers so the ascended Christ has given he ascended up on high and gave gifts to men because every one of us is given a Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so the measure of the gift of Christ is here and because every one of us has a measure of the gift of Christ he's given gifts catch that we've been given gifts because of this measure now going back to verse n he says now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first in the lower parts of the Earth this is just beautiful teaching that he inserts there he says he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all the heavens that he might fill all things so he has ascended with the purpose that he would have preeminence or fill all things and that you have a measure of the gift of Christ every one of us is given a Grace according to that measure of the gift of Christ that he wants to fill up amen and because he wants to fill that up he's given gifts the ascended Christ is to fill all things and this is a process that coming to full measure process of this Grace being uh applied in your life to where he can fill up all things have prence so God gives gifts Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead there he is the firstborn from the dead the only begotten of the son the father that in all things he might have the preeminence right so he wants to fill All Things fill up the full measure of the gift of Christ Ephesians 1: 22 and 23 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so the body is the fullness of him that filth all in all every one of us has been given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ Christ has ascended that he might fill all things so having been ascended he gives gifts and he gives these gifts of prophets evangelists teachers Apostles and pastors and he has given these gifts to do this he has given these gifts to that he that that that they might fill all things that in all things he might have the preeminence that the body can be the fullness of him that filth all in all they say well that's quite the uh that's quite the stringing together of other scriptures brother Aaron well let's just read and let's cover again he's every one of us has been given a Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ that he might fill all things so he gave gifts to men Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints the Saints those have already been born again Ephesians 1 is addressing those who have already received the Holy Ghost those who are already in the body of Christ remember the Ephesian church is not like the Pentecostal Church in Corinthians that was unsettled and tossed about and and and but this is a church that's matured in the word ready for their placing ready to enter into the final inheritance for the perfecting Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ why do these gifts exist why does God give them so that we could be in awe of the teacher whoa no it's there for you the gift is there for you for the perfecting of the Saints the maturing the full development of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying the building up and the increase of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the one faith and of the knowledge of the one son of God unto a perfect man that we all would do this under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ comes back to verse S un every one of us is given a Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ and so there is the work of the spirit in our lives to bring us to a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ according to the gift and the measure that he's given us so just as Christ grew and increased and learned obedience did the father's will as we we can see that in the scripture God's word now is to edify the body until it can mature into the fullness of Christ unto a perfect man of full age is what that means fully grown mature it means we are to go from babe to adulthood and the sermon of God be with us brother bam says you can't expect a baby to be born a man it's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to a full stature not some get converted tonight and tomorrow go preach the gospel we grow up into manhood into the stature of Christ that it's conveying and I do not believe he's he's saying it's prohibitive that there would be some sort of conversion and be able to minister or to preach the gospel but he's saying that there's there's something some maturing that goes through this there's something that God has in mind you can't expect a baby to be born a man we would certainly not think that uh even though I've seen some newborns that looked every bit of man uh especially with their head of hair but it's not they're not born men we we get that we get they don't have the capacity you know son here's the keys to my car you got your own room you know let's go to Donovan for steak and he's you know 48 Hours old we just we don't even think that way but in some ways in a spiritual sense that's exactly what we do think wow and we actually go so far as to say well this is characteristic of an infant this is their birth this is how they act and we say this is it man this is the penultimate this is the way it should be not realizing this is a stage of growth and development this is a certain time period where the spirit of God is moving in somebody's life but you can't expect a babe in Christ who's been born by the word of God to be a fully grown mature man you've got to grow into the stature of Christ you are every bit the Son and Daughter of God when you were born again you are every bit a child of God destined to the Rapture nothing can take that away sin cannot be imputed to you John even go so far as to say you can't sin and then says if you do sin remember you have a perpetuation so there's some levels of maturity and understanding even in that but it's there's nothing to take away from being a young but the Young's got to grow up we've got to grow up into the stature of Christ so clear for the perfecting of the Saints and the perfect man verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children there's something wrong with being a child nope something wrong with being a babe nope something wrong with being a young nope no do you need to grow up yep amen right there's got to be a growing up that we be no more children Paul is not saying well if you're a child you're lost oh my goodness you're lost now you start out as a child what does God do because we're children he gives us his Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is living it's Dynamic it's working it's active and he gives it on the inside of us as a teacher but then he doesn't just leave us to ourselves I'm so I don't let me think how I can say this I'm so glad that God is a homeschool parent I was going to say good thing he's not a hom School School parent but he doesn't just send us to our room to figure it out right just hasn't he just hasn't like say well you got the Holy Ghost go figure it out kid he's active he's available if you want to say he sends us to school and he gives us the best teachers he's looking out after us he puts us in in classrooms with other believers of like faith and this is God watching out to cultivate you and to grow you and he's happy that you're a child but his vision is that you become a man he's happy that you're young but his vision is that you become young lady that you grow up so there's nothing wrong with being a young one but we can't stay youngans forever that we be no more Young on tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of dark and by the slide of men and cunning crabness whereby they light and wait to lie and wait to deceive there's a vulnerability to the young ons vulnerability when you're young and and enthusiastic and impressionable and Desiring and this newness of life that's inside of you you want to serve God you want to please God and you have a lot of zeal and a lot of enthusiasm there's a vulnerability to being tossed about and carried around but speaking the truth in love and this is the mandate to parents this is the mandate to Ministry this is the mandate to the elders we've got to speak the truth in love and speaking the truth in love may the children grow up into him Christ in all things comes right back that he might feel all things and so therefore I hope you can see just perfectly how Paul has pinpointed this God's desire is that we would grow up into him in all things he has ascended on high and gives these gifts that we might might be built up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body under the edifying of itself in love the use of these phrases in love in chapter 4 are not arbitrary they're very intentional but if I could just summarize it this way the purpose of the Holy Spirit living in you is to bring you to maturity it's to cause us to grow up to the image and the stature of Christ says may grow up into him in all things all things it's the whole it's everything that's what all things means in Hebrews chapter 1 ver2 hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds Christ who is the perfect man in whom we are fitted together and we are to come into the stature of Christ of whom we are the body of this son has been appointed heir of all things this is the one that were to grow up into him in All Things Revelations 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son I use these scriptures to say that if we are going to inherit all things we need to grow up into him in all things it's the very purpose of Ephesians chapter four that we may grow up into him in all things why because he has appointed heir of all things and as children of God we are joint HS with Christ and he that overcomes shall inherit all things so in order to inherit all things we must grow up into him in all things when that which is perfect the part is done away the time of all things the fullness of all things grow up it means to increase means to cause to grow to augment to increase to become greater we must grow up increase into him says of John the Baptist in Luke 1:80 and the child grew and whacked strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel the child grew it means he grew up this is a word that's used of Youth of children babes growing up the child grew and whack strong in spirit when it says we grow up into him in All Things Paul uses the word that expressly indicates from the the first generation of and animation of life to adulthood says it of Jesus Christ in Luke 2:40 and the child grew and whack strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon them should that not also be the mark and characteristic of us who are born again that we would grow the child grew in wax strong in spirit that we as children of God would grow in waack strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God being upon us that we may grow up into him is the same word that's used of John the Baptist growing up before he was presented to Israel Jesus Christ a child growing up as a child and Jesus when he gives the parable of the sewer in Mark chapter 4 verse 8 and those on the good ground he said did yield fruit that sprang up and increased grew up and brought forth some 30 some 60 and some 100 we know that the seed is the word that the full word is what grows this word is what grows and increase not just a seed not just green not just a sapling but ripen come to maturity the child grew the seed increased that's the same that's the image that Paul's trying to create when he says that we may grow up in Acts chap 6:7 it says and the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and the great a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith this is the book of Acts and I say another Branch will do the same and this is one of the to me one of the most singular greatest aspects of the book of Acts is the word of God increased there's a lot of things in the book of Acts that we could find in other places in the Bible there's a lot of things that we could find in the book of Acts in other religions and other areas but there's one thing you can't find anywhere in any other religion but is singular to the church and singular to the book of Acts and that's the word of God increased the word of God increased it's the same word it grew same word used in in Ephesians grow up the same word used in Luke 1 and chapter 2 grow up the the same word used in Mark 4 increased the word of God increased he uses again in chapter 12 acts 12:24 but the word of God grew and multiplied listen if there's going to be another book of Acts written it must have this characteristic that it is the word of God that is growing the and in our youth and our enthusiasm and the Holy Spirit pouring out yes it'll be there because it was in the book of Acts but after these things happened what demonstrated the fact that they had tasted that the Lord was gracious was that the works were there and the word grew amen and multiplied and that's what the word is doing in our lives as we grow up into him the word revealed what is it it's the eating of the book it's the feeding on the son of man the revealing of the word Works to mature our character in Romans 8: 29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate right to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren it's characterized as the firstborn from the dead prior earlier and we were reading here he's the first born among many Brethren he was the only begotten Son of God not anymore because now there's many others who have been begotten and now he is our elder brother this principle of the firstborn is crucial to understanding certain teachings the first born among many Brethren that means there's going to be many others that are born of the father as he was born of the father conformed to the image of his son this is something that's not temporary this is something that's more inherent it's not just an external image the son was in God's image the son was in the image of the father now we are predestinated that's Destiny that's not birth it's Destiny when you were born again on the day that you were born again by the baptism of ghost you could say well I'm a Son of God every bit a Son of God I was a daughter of God but you have not yet come fully into the image of who you are there's a lot more that goes into it God's image the father was expressed in the son now those who are elected to a new birth who are forn therefore elected to a birth by forn knowledge there are seed of God to be born again now our destiny points to being conformed to the image of his son and image is not a look it's a life I think sometimes that's the way we think about it image is a is a look the image is that's when we think about the book of Acts it's the image right it's what it looks like but image is a life it's values it's a character it's the things that that really relate to the person remember Satan had the wrong image of God he had the optical image the Grandeur the bigness the the the the imposing mightiness of him and all the beauty but the beauty of God was his character and so the look is the image is not a look but it's a life so we are to be conformed to the image the life the character of Christ conformed to the character of Christ and it repeats it in Romans 12 1-2 I 1:2 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is your reasonable service we have not presented our bodies as a as a Living Sacrifice when we're born again we've offered up our hearts our souls we've offered our all but it's our soul that God takes and indwells us and now he's saying to you whove been regenerated by the baptism of the Holy Ghost present your bodies your mind mind and your your flesh present it to God as a Living Sacrifice holy accept God that's your reasonable service that's the least you ought to do it is what you're called to do and there he cautions be not conformed to this world this conforming to the world is that which is temporary and transitory and subject to change but be ye transformed which is permanent Eternal be transformed by the renewing of your mind not the renewing of your soul your soul has been born again it's been bought it's been purchased it's covered in the the shed blood of Jesus Christ the the spirit lives in you the inside teacher lives there now our minds are to be renewed and it's the renewing of our minds that gives the proof of what is good acceptable and perfect in the will of God only through the renewing of our minds can our lives be the proof of the perfect will of God only through the renewing of our spirits and our flesh that we can prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God only as I yield as a blood bought Son of God only as I yield completely to him and allow him to have preeminence can my mind be renewed to transformation and my life can prove the perfect will of God brother brandom in the power of transformation says now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have there's some finality to that now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled the Holy Spirit as we have this is our have right next slide he says now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought into to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word this is it this is the marching orders this is what gives real purpose and meaning I can say as a young Christian and I began to serve the Lord it was when I it was awakened to me and I'll get maybe more into the specific subject of of what I was studying at the time 27 something years ago whatever it was that when it opened up to me I realize oh this gives me purpose I'm not just saved and just holding on for dear hope that I don't backslide I hope I don't go through another cycle I hope no it was like now there's re there's reason to live there's purpose to this Holy Ghost it was transformative for me initially in my thinking and we're to be transformed because we have the Holy Ghost now we want to have the mind of Christ now we want to be transformed from the Natural Things of life to be brought into to do the perfect will will of God through this process of transformation by God's spirit through his word this is the desire that Paul had in Galatians 4:19 chapter 4 and even around there you could say Paul is speaking on the subject of adoption you did run well who hindered you that you didn't fulfill all the will of God he's talking about maturity and how that he labored and desired to see a full growth of the word in them he says my little children of whom I travail and birth again until Christ be formed in you my my little children they are already birthed in the gospel they are already under his tutelage they they already begun in the race he says I travail until Christ be formed in you not through a birth because Christ is in The Believer by birth but Christ be formed formed that word to be formed in you means to manifest externally morphe is what it comes from that it be manifested externally in your attitude and your conduct and your behavior even in the way that you dress and the way you act but Christ be formed that he manifest amen he display his attributes through you amen it's that we would have the mind of Christ we're in that time where brother says it's forming into the head for the Rapture it's from that sheveport Series in ' 65 now it's in the head the top the peak for the Rapture he said this is not the day of Pentecost the Pentecostal age is passed Pentecost is gone this is Harvest Time and the Harvest Time the grain the waters done been poured out the grain's getting ripe good that's where we are it's harvest time it's in the head it's to grow up it's to mature Our Lives should be following the same pattern spiritually well what happens brother if I'm not if I don't fully understand this and fully understand that let's not worry about that let's just get in the process just yield to the process accept the fact that as a child of God you've been born again and and if you haven't I encourage you by all means seek forgiveness you know look into the Forgiveness of sins accept his forgiveness identified with the sacrifice call upon God to be saved a a and receive him as your savior be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because you feel that that forgiveness of sins and know know that you know that he's promised you the baptism ghost be sure that you've received this indwelling of the Holy Spirit to be born again cuz you must be born again and then once you know that you're walk that you have this blessed experience we should just desire to walk to grow to increase let's not so much worry about the results cuz that's his process that's his job but let's worry about what we must do and let's yield to the process one of the things you look to in a child is whether or not they're stubborn or rebellious so they won't listen the stubbornness and Rebellion these sins of childhood and Adolescence indicate whether or not this son will ever learn whether or not he'll ever be able to follow in your steps whether or not he is going to be a proper child and so what we need to learn in this stage is to yield to oby obey in 1 John Chapter 2 I'll just skip to verse 5 I did not think I'd get this far but I know I've been going pretty fast today and so please forgive me if it was too fast but say who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him when we obey when we keep his word this is the mark and characteristic of a child of God he obeys his father if I was to say right now son go get me a glass of water you know there's only three in this room that would do it and everybody's like right well I mean I I'm assuming only three would do it thanks brother the Lord I appreciate it but I'm referring to my sons would they would respond they would listen right they would identify with that and this is a mark and characteristic of a child of God they hear the voice they hear the shepherd's voice and they do another they will not follow they keep his word and the Beautiful part I know that I always joke around I know you remember perfectly you may not remember even the fact that we preached a series series of services on perfect love but in him VAR is a love of God perfected when we obey it means God's will for his love is working in us it's reaching its purpose our love for him it's purposeful when we do what he asked us to do our love for somebody else it means something and it matters when it changes our Behavior that's the beautiful part of Love Is there love is so outstanding that it it realizes even in situations where something may be unreasonable it'll act out of love for the person yes because it's love and then there's times that love won't act because of the person it knows this isn't what's best so when love is when we keep his word that's the love of God's that's the purpose we're beneficiaries of it and he's a beneficiary of the love that we have for him and it means the love of God is working in us and that's how we know that we are in him is when we obey it do love is perfected and then verse 6 the reason why I use this passage he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked he that says he's a Son of God ought to live as a Son of God lived he that says he abides in Christ ought to also live and act as Christ walked been thinking a lot lately about what would Jesus do and I've been thinking what would Jesus do because it really is the question anymore that when people were wearing those bracelets however many decades ago that was people had the what would Jesus do bumper stickers and the wjg uh on their bracelets and different things and you would observe their life and you'd say well if your life's the answer it means anything everything it's all fair game but he that saith he abideth in him ought to also walk as Christ walked that walk means make progress I have no greater desire than to see that my children walk in truth that doesn't mean accept truth but progress ress and Truth amen walking in the light watching more unfold this is the mark and characteristic of a real child of God 1 Peter 1: 13-16 he says wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children children who ought to themselves walk as their father walked walk as Christ walked and that walking as obedient children and the loins of our mind being girded up being sober hoping to the end for this grace to be brought as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance you have been born again by the baptism the ghost he's revealing truth to you as a babe now we're not to Fashion ourselves like we did when we were in the world we're to change put off the old man put on the new man which is born a new but as he which had called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of life amen there's to walk as he walked progress grow the grace that is to be brought to us when we come to the Head the Capstone it comes crying Grace Grace what is the Capstone the perfecting the finishing as obedient children we're to Fashion ourselves after him in 2 Corinthians 3: 17 to 18 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord there is there is Liberty that's the whole ball game As Trump said it's the whole ball game he said two Corinthians though 3:17 but we all with open face beholden as in a glass a mirror the glory of the Lord right this is what it ought to be that we understand that's me we begin to understand when we look into the mirror of God's word that's me and seeing ourselves in the word when all obscure is removed when all darkness is removed when the spirit of Truth directs us to the word we will with open face Behold Him in a glass but see in ourselves that the image were to come into are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord this is our daily task is to look into the mirror of God's word and allow the glory that we see in the word reflect back upon us and change our Vis change our thinking change our lives to be changed from glory to glory by the spirit of the Lord that is what it means where the Spirit of the Lord there is Liberty to be changed where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty for the glory of the Lord to make a change upon me not to make me feel good but to change my life brother Bram said in the unveiling of God the light over the word as the light of the sun changes the seed from glory to glory we also become more like him as we live in his presence like him being conformed to his blessed image as we walk with him we have to lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened amen light over the the word changes the seed from glory to glory light upon the seed of God in your soul will change the rest of your nature into his nature and one day we'll change your mortal body amen into a glorified body we're changed from glory to glory as we Behold Him in the word as the spirit of God operates in our lives we're not becoming more Sons we're becoming a son in His image we're growing we're increasing the child grew the fruit the seed sprang up and increase the word of God grew conformed to His Image transformed by the renewing of our minds grow up into him in all things growing in Grace in all things him having preeminence coming to the perfect man the measure and statute of fullness of Christ the word is replete over and over and over again that babes must grow to adulthood young ons must mature and Christ is it Christ is revealed in his own word been doing some study on this very beautiful things I'm finding down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went into the ground the complete seed then it come through the feet Luther come back out through Wesley then into the Pentecostals the tongues in the lips it's the marking characteristic of the outpouring of the gifts the restoration of the gifts that Pentecostal age even in the L toen age the tongues see that's now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is am the last thing is for him to step into it it it's language just describing what's taking place for him to step into it it's if I could put it this way there's nothing left but for him to be manifested for him to have PR for him the fullness of him that filth all and all to come to its Perfection to come to its Rapture to come to its ripeness to come to its Harvest said there's nothing left but him to come to step in the next he says is the intelligence that's him the intelligence the head not the tongues not the but the the not just the eyes but the intelligence to make sense of it all of what's being seen and what's being said the next is intelligence we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer it's always been the holy ghost in the church it's always been the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Son of God working in the church but now it comes in the last days where he's to come forth as the son of man manifested again God In the Flesh of his bride God In the Flesh of his people living out the word the life lived by the word being the word expressed he's governed it all the way through but now then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning now when you when you read that there is so much scripture that we could begin to just build in our minds in this image of Adam and the woman in the beginning and how this reflected God's purpose his primary objective to have a bride of his choosing Heaven and Earth beautiful image and then Christ comes forth as the second Adam or the last Adam not just a living soul but a quickening spirit he is a new creature he is a new race super race he's not just Adam patched up it's something different now that God's plan foreshadowed he comes forth but he say that now the bride is to come forth and be the complete body of Christ that reveals what was hid in Christ the bride which is taken out of the sight of Christ taken out of Christ he says like Adam's wife was taken out of him at the beginning now if we go back to the beginning the scripture does not tell us that in when God brought man forth you found him a babe wrapped in swadding clothes lying in the manger Adam was made a fully grown adult male Adam was brought forth in flesh in placed in the garden with a commission Adam was not necessarily learning he was manifesting Adam was not L they been instructed he had the mind of God all the channels were clear God put him on Earth says it's yours have dominion run it the way you want hadam name all the animals and then brought forth this woman to bring forth all God to grow multiply and replenish the Earth and God just Fellowship with them God wasn't saying well Adam don't you think that should be a giraffe I mean seriously come on think about it no Adam did it Adam did not run around the garden saying in the name of God the father in the name of God the son right Adam just did it he was a fully placed adopted full grown adult male son and when the woman was brought forth and the brought and the man was brought to the woman Adam to go oh a cute little thing I'm going to marry you one day that's right I'm nope fully grown woman fully mature the woman came from him fully grown a fully grown adult female ready to fulfill the promise she was able and ready then right it was just a matter of timing but Jesus was a begotten Son of God Jesus was born a babe and what was he he was made perfect he was adopted and glorified and we are to come forth the same way the same process but we're to come to that place of adulthood and maturity where we can bring forth a place of placing musicians if you'd come we'll just end there I'll hold off on uh that Ephesians there brother John if you just want to bring it to that last quote from you must be born again go back and read Ephesians chapter 1 as we're reading Ephesians chapter 4 in love speaking the truth in love may grow up into him and that the body tempered together makes increase of itself in love he says in Ephesians chapter 1 that in love he predestinated us unto adoption I want you to start thinking about the subject of adoption brother B says this and you must be born again he said there are no shortcuts they want to come right quick they don't want to grow there is a an attitude of impatience sometimes even in Christianity even amongst those who maybe are emotional or given to those things they they they want it to come right quick they don't want to grow and he says we grow in the Lord it takes growth and experience tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're manifested sons of God he says nonsense where do you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies and grotto men yes nothing wrong with being a baby nothing wrong with being a young and but there is something wrong if you don't grow up that's right would you agree there is something wrong if the word's not working mightily you can have all the characteristics and marks of a babe all the marks and characteristics of a young but if the word of God is not growing and increasing if it's not multiplying if it's not fruitful in your life it begs the question have you been born again the only kind of children that the world can bring forth and the church nomino can bring forth are dead right they cannot produce the life of the word they can produce a lot of things but they can't produce the growth of the word of God Amen and this is a question that you must be satisfied within yourself is to know that his word is working mightily in me and I have been thinking this quite a bit as we've been ministering on this subject even over the last month or so that I'm hoping that in this there's a Grace that's being ministered to recognize there's a reason why we've made mistakes that we've made reason why we continue to make mistakes is we're still growing yes it it's not just a song for the Sunday school he's still working on me ain't it interesting that those who aren't even born again usually are the one singing it when in reality it's us that he's really working on I mean our our kids could sing he's still working on me talking about their dad to make me what he wants me to be right but then God when we're born again we say he's still working on me he he's not finished with me yet I there one thing I've said I think I've maybe said it here before that if you look at my children and you and you and you see things in them and you're you're disappointed and you judge me as a father that's fine that's fine you have every right to do that but I ask that you not judge them as a son and don't judge them as a daughter because you ain't seen them yet you may see a lot of me you may see a lot of my mistakes and a lot of my lack of faithfulness and there may be conclusions you can make about me as a 49y old man but I said don't judge them yet cuz he's not done and I want God to have a chance with them and I say that to give a Grace to all of us to realize there's reasons why we've gone the way that we've gone there's reasons why we've made mistakes and it's not because we weren't seed it's not because we're not elected it's not because we're not his children it's because we're still learning and maybe today we could say Lord I want to I want to learn better I want to grow I'll be transparent there's different junctures in my life life when I look at him that God moved me through great suffering and tremendous loss turbulence and some of the worst difficult times I've ever been through my life have have preceded transition and I've wondered God can you not just tell me what you're want to do you me to do like show up when everything's just perfect and say Aaron I'd like you to do this and I'm like perfect right and everything just goes smoothly but he has a way of wearing us down and tearing things apart and putting us in a place and he's teaching us to trust and we go through things and you know as much as I'd like to say I've been a perfect Son of God I've only always obeyed his will and if there's anybody in the Bible who can relate to me it's job or Jesus right I've only suffered according to God's will but you know the reality is I brought a lot on myself and I'm so grateful that I'm his son because he's never given up on me you realize there's something about bringing forth a child in this world that no matter what happens they can change their name they can change their gender do alls of stuff but they'll never they'll never stop being your child they're always your child that's the way God feels about you there's not an adoption in God's mind where he says you know what I made a huge mistake when I adopted you you're crazy and try to reverse the process you're his own isn't it beautiful let's stand together today
