TRANSCRIPT
========================================
knowing where we're going with this Parable this morning I just get excited reading through it thinking of all the different applications and understanding that we can have and looking at this it's a remarkable scripture in light of the original sin and how that God in in the beginning created and it's the wicked one that comes later and so seed that perverts God God's creation so I know there's a lot of things that we could take to heart and gather from this but today we're going to be speaking on the seeds of the Kingdom now we started Wednesday night on a series on the kingdom and it's called The Kingdom Heaven's mystery Earth's glory and as we look at the Kingdom I'd say it's just a vast subject and I'm sure that you yourselves have probably even over the last few days if you were here Wednesday night notice just how frequently you can find references to the kingdom whether it be in the message of the hour in your Bible so it is a very very large subject and I don't I I try to resist the uh kind of that inclination where we're kind of wired to identify patterns as human beings and and so I could uh I could preach a sermon this morning on carpet or flooring and bring out all sorts of types and you go home and be like oh my goodness we have a floor this is so spiritual and that's not what I'm trying to do with the phrase the kingdom but you will find that it is a very vast subject that gives us an opportunity to cover many different principles so we just we'll just obey the Lord and how he would lead us and the things that he would want us to explore under this but I want to start today by going back to the beginning and identifying some principles from the start because I'll say the kingdom has been God's objective from the beginning uh even as brother Lucas was singing and even how it began a king isn't a king if he only has a throne and what a thought in that and what a a great thing to think about what was in the mind of God and what he was meditating on and what he was kind of his his heart was indicting uh and there is there's such connection with what we've been ministering on perfect love so I'm saying this isn't the we haven't finished the series on perfect love we've just transitioned to another view uh because truly if God is love and he Christ is that Capstone and charity is God and it's perfect love then really that's what we're ministering all the time and if the goal in this hour is to get the bride to recognize who she is then the word is show the word is a mirror to the bride so she can recognize herself but God has been the the kingdom is has been God's objective from the beginning and in the sermon countdown I'm just going to read a couple statements that we used on Wednesday and in doing this I hope to set forth before you some key principles that we're looking at in this series on the kingdom says as science achieves something Looking Backward and he gives these examples in this sermon countdown that even though it may seem like technology is advancing us forward brother Brahman says no it's marching us backwards uh and truly we could say that as technology it hit maybe at some point we felt like we had Advanced but now we've gotten back to just using our thumb and that's all we do anymore so I feel like did his technology is just marching us marching us backwards but they said God achieves going this way going forward to the kingdom and so God is achieving God had something he wanted in the beginning we read a couple Wednesdays ago how that God wanted to achieve for himself a Brides that's going to be God's achievement and so God achieves going this way and not I'm not sure just exactly which way brother Branham was appointing him if you conceptualized that one is trending downward or backwards or in a negative way God is saying God always goes forward to the kingdom whatever man does is regression whatever God does is progression God is always moving forward he's always advancing toward or forward to the kingdom that's a principle we understand if God acts if God moves if he doesn't act it's only to serve to further us to the kingdom now in the sermon Christ is the mystery God revealed he says we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit in life in our own life that's uh that that's kind of maybe the whole substance of what is uh burning in my heart is the kingdom is the word of God made spirit in life in our own life so he said well what's the kingdom the kingdom of God is within you what does it mean to think about the kingdom well it's it's to have the life of God inside of you because the kingdom is the word of God living through his subjects living through his people he says to bring to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God Was Won and that kind of hearkens back to the days of Christ so he's saying the word of God is one in his church makes the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day so you are a reflection of the message you have a part to play and then it says to be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve now notice how this comes right back to the beginning you know Eden is brought up so frequently in the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed that third purpose to restore it back to an Eden condition the kingdom he says in the it's rightly positioned in the beginning of the Garden of Eden he says the threefold mystery of God his body so his body his bride as part of this great mystery that's why we say Christ is the mystery of God revealed the bride is the mystery of God finished it's the consummation it's the completion and so in looking at this subject today the seeds of the Kingdom I I could say uh if just to kind of give some context to that we're wanting to go back and look at God's will in the beginning as we read that God uh the kingdom of God cannot be rightly established on permissive will brother Brahm says so the kingdom cannot be established fully on permissive will it's got to come back to his perfect will so we want to go back to the beginning to identify his perfect will and once we identify his perfect will in the beginning I think it gives us so much more purpose and color to why we're living today and and I just find myself having to draw from a Wednesday night so much in that to make this point there's such a there's a fine line between uh Living For The Rapture and and and and and being dismissive of where we are now in the sense that wow we want we want to get out of here we want to leave we want a Rapture I'm hungry about the body change and I want to go meet the Lord in the air and there's I believe there's this fine line that you can cross to where you've you've now are so forward-looking that you miss what's taking place right now and just how critical the now is to what it is you're longing for and so we don't want to find ourselves looking over today when it comes to how am I going to meet him in the air how can I see that this change comes you have to be recognizing your day and its message and what God is doing right now so this morning as we go forward in the seeds of the Kingdom if you could take your Bibles and turn to Genesis chapter 2 verse 25. and since this church began a few years ago there's probably been no more scriptures we haven't we've probably used more scriptures and more thoughts from these first two chapters and first few chapters of the Book of Genesis uh than any other place perhaps and I find it's just endless in terms of what you can draw out of it and and even if we stopped drawing things out of it the the word that's in it uh requires emphasis and deserves emphasis so there's certainly a lot here I'm not trying to um anticipate your complaints to the repetition it just there's so much in it it's worth it to repeat it now I'm going to look at verse 25 and this is a conclusion I'm kind of looking at the end of the com the creation and as God had set everything forth and he's and point something out and hopefully be able to move forward very quickly he says and they were both naked the man and his wife and so as it kind of sets this in there and that phrase you could say the man and his wife were naked and not ashamed they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed if I could say this I present to you that this is God's kingdom as we read from Genesis 1 all the way to Genesis 2 25 we can say this is God's kingdom man and wife living together in a perfect Eden nothing out of cater nothing out of order and I know we emphasize this a lot in the sermon perfect love so there's a lot that the series there's a lot that you can draw from this is God's kingdom this is his creation uh man and woman there in the Eden up over the whole earth ruling and reigning this is God's Kingdom and it was sovereignly created by God God did this sovereignly of his own will of his own ambition God set things forth it wasn't uh this wasn't an accident you find a lot of times in science that things were created by accident or invented or discovered by accident they're trying to do one thing else it's like oh look there's an earth over here what happened and let's just see how it unfolds and see how it plays out this was God being very deliberate very intentional I often think about brother kydry Diggs a sermon on uh God is intentional and just put it in such words we realize if God's intentional then he's he has intent in anything that he allows to happen and anything that he overtly does and so it says the man and his wife if we put it this way the man and his wife are naked and not ashamed or naked and unashamed this expresses a very deep mystery in God's heart that's kind of a peculiar statement would you agree with me it's kind of an odd way to end the description of creation you got Genesis 1 and now we come to this point where it says and the man and his wife are naked and unashamed they're like well where do we go from here that's kind of an odd way to end it but this is this is something that God sets forward for us to think about and perhaps chew on a little bit and say well this is this is God summarizing creation and a lot we know that Love's great Mysteries bound up in the purpose of the earth God's heart purpose is to get a bride of his own choosing to it the Earth was created creation is for the purpose of God achieving a bride for himself and so when it says that naked and ashamed it kind of sets the man and his wife said the man and his wife were naked and not ashamed it sets them forth this is the key to the uh I think for you to catch if you want the end to make sense this is a really good point just to pay attention and if you wake up in about an hour it'll still all make sense if you just catch this part when he says this the man and his wife are both naked and not ashamed it's very simple description isn't it if you were given one sentence to describe Eden you'd find yourself with a lot of commas right and you'd want to just keep going and going how could I describe it one sentence but God God feels that he's got a great way to express it and he says and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed and he's happy with that he's happy to set it for us so he describes it in a very simple unadorned terms when he says then man and his wife were naked uh and unashamed this is it's very peculiar but it's a very very deep what's what's in this image is vast and he describes them as naked and unashamed and there's those two words together begin to create this picture for me and I felt this I just felt this something welling up inside of me I said that's it this is this is part of what God wants us to see he describes them this is the key as seeds that had not yet blossomed that they are naked and unashamed he's describing the way that here they are bear but yet there's no shame in that there's no loss in that he describes them I'm saying could we consider that when he says they were naked and unashamed that he's describing them unadorned and unblossomed or in such a way that we could see that they are bare and fruitless but yet they have they they are they have the potential inside of them because fruit we know is the Flesh of a seed and so there's something in that which says well they were naked and unashamed naked as bare and this has physical application it's also very descriptive of their minds and their hearts and their emotions I was pure and so this in this description of them they're naked but then he says not ashamed and the word means they were not disappointed or there was no lacking or there was uh no anxiety for lacking in other words there was they were naked but yet there was no shame they were there was no fruit but they were not disappointed because being naked and they're being bare they're there and it's not as if well there's no potential here there's no opportunity there's no way up there was all power and potential of provision was available in the seed all power and potential of provision is available in the creation so when God describes them as naked they're bare but they're not ashamed there's no anxiety if nothing is else is Manifest there's no anxiety as to their condition because there's power within themselves to produce what they have need of and so there is man and women the man and his wife were not ashamed although they were naked and that's Genesis 2 25 that ends chapter 2 but then chapter one is in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth now with those two scriptures Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 25 they frame a picture that God wants us to look at when we think of creation that in the beginning God created then the very last words as it relates to that scene and as he gives that final brush stroke to the picture that he's painting it's and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed so this is these are bookends uh that kind of give us the shading to say I'm emphasizing this remember how brother Brown said that was the beginning or in the beginning before Genesis 3 before that in the beginning was eternity and so this is God's emphasis about an eternal Eden and these two scriptures kind of frame it so that we can look to it and say this is the picture of God's perfection and he says in the beginning God created that heaven we know that's the Tabernacle of God and it is the Tabernacle of Elohim it's the there's the heaven of Heavens there's a realm there's a dimension that God creates and and it has uh it's the highest of all orders highest of all Dimensions when it says God created the Heaven that speaks of the first uh the supernatural if we kind of extend that even into the stars and the heavens we know that that's God's first Bible so even before the written bible God wrote his word in the stars and in the heavens and so God creates the heaven and he creates the Earth we say the land as opposed to the heavens and the atmospheres as you read and we touched on this before as you begin to read from that point on The Narrative of the Bible of creation is solely relates to the Earth and what comes out of the Earth and we look at these as the seed chapters chapter 1 chapter 2 God is sowing seeds and he says in the beginning God created heaven and earth they're set forth as a singular creation not God created the Heaven there's a lot of narrative and there's different things that happen then God creates the Earth so they're not they're not mentioned as uh in separate instances but he chooses to mention them together existing together not separately existing or against each other that God created the Heaven and that's great and then God could the Earth and there was this battle between Heaven and Earth and all that's not the way that God sets them forth and we know that the very first attributes and characteristics that God gives the Earth is the chaos and then the spirit of God moved upon the face of Earth and that so that we could recognize first God's image the the Covenant God expressed his ambition in Genesis 1. Heaven and Earth is a great beautiful expression and then he gives us this grace to recognize that all of our chaos he'll remedy as the spirit of God moves upon the face of the water and brings brings order to our lives and so brother random says this and and fall into part of the world I think I have the word there I'm putting all sorts of interesting Easter eggs in my titles or my slides these days but the one who created the Heaven and Earth expresses himself back through his creation what he is in his program so when God creates this is the principle God expresses himself we could say that about artists and and people in authors and those that write and draw on different things and write poems that there's something about the Creator that's expressed in the creation and God is no different the one who created the Heaven and the Earth expresses himself in his creation what he is in his program so if we call Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 his program or his creation then he's expressed in that what he is is expressed in that what his plan is what his system is what he's wanting to accomplish God expresses himself in it and God is expressed in Genesis 1 1. that first expression of the Heaven and the Earth it portrays the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it's portrayed in the very first sentence of the Bible what God is going to achieve he's going to have a Heavenly bridegroom he's going to become an Earthly bride and Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth there's one of the translations into it to the Hebrews I believe I may have gotten this from one of their writings it says God in the beginning created substance of the heavens and substance of the Earth so the principle was that when God created and I know that you see this in the message of hour when God created it wasn't that God just created everything it was just all there in an instance that God said let there be and then all of a sudden everything just appeared and everything was there and it's full maturity that when God spoke his word is a seed and as God spoke that there was this process of this unfolding and so the principle is in the beginning God brought God brought into existence they have the substance and the things and the elements that would make up the Heaven and the Earth so at the very initial outset in the beginning God created heaven and earth even in seed form maybe not in the same way that we would think about natural seed but in some way God when he begins he begins with some element and from that element it's going to come everything else it's a great principle here he does this for a reason the Bible says in John 1 1 to verse 3 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made said the seed the word is a seed that A sower sowed in the ground he's taken a lot from The Parables of Jesus he says it over and over and over again the word is a seed that the soul were sowed and so in the beginning God created the Heavenly Earth the the elements are there in the beginning God creates the the very things from which all Heavens will come forth the very things from with all which all Earth is going to come forth he sets them forth in seed form in the beginning was the word and I'm trying to tell you the word is a seed and Satan's Eden brother bear says the Holy Spirit of God's holy word had a man and woman naked and didn't know it how beautiful life of the word the seed the word now notice how he describes if we could say Genesis 1 1 to Genesis 2 25 brother bam describes it as man and woman naked he says how beautiful the seed the word this says and he said in the life of the word the man and the woman are naked and not ashamed now think of them they're unadorned but there's potential brother Adam says here they are the Holy Spirit had man and woman naked and they didn't know it but they were not ashamed and he says how beautiful life of the word the seed the word in the beginning was the word in the beginning we see seed and God's power to transform he says God in six thousand years had planted all these wonderful seeds or he had spoke his word it shall be this way this tree shall be this shall be everything was perfect it was just good and he commanded each one of those seeds that they would be catch this they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word of God had spoken in them should be remember in Genesis 1 how the life was in the seed to bring forth of its kind and after its kind and it was within itself and the flesh uh the seed which had flesh had power within itself to reproduce itself and that's all there in Genesis 1 and I didn't I didn't want to get bogged down and just looking at that because I think these statements are so good at summarizing he commanded each one of those seeds that they would trans with power in them to transform themselves into the plant that the word of God said they would be if it was an oak tree it'd bring forth an oak it was a palm it'd bring forth a palm because the great Creator had just sent forth his word and the word seed was there before the realed seed was ever formed and the word formed the seed now there's the there's an expression of Heaven and Earth that you have the word seeds there before the next Parts formed and said the word formed the seed see he made the world out of things that do not appear he made the world by his word God spoke everything into existence okay are we together in this now so in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and then he says and in this with the man and his wife were both naked and not ashamed now there is uh there's a manifestation there's a picture that God's painted but what I would like to present is that even that is seed form even that in itself is just a beginning now in Matthew Chapter 13 let's look at verse 36 we read verses 24 to 30 wherein Jesus says the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field so now in verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him said saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field in other words it's given unto us to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven unto them it is not given as you said yourself Jesus so now that we are alone could you declare and open up to us what you meant by the parable of the tares of the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man now we can see this in creation this is so this is such a large thought that this is in no way I'm not putting a period on this I'm not an always say this is the way you've got to see it I'm only looking at it from a very very small angle he says the son of man is the one that sowed the good seed remember in his field is it in somebody's plot of land God created the Heaven and the Earth seed is sown in the earth it's his and he says the field is the world God created the world for a purpose the good seat are the children of the Kingdom so that this is God's desire he's always moving toward the kingdom and he says but the cares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sold them is the devil now catch this the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels and therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world now and he says this remember in the parable they said oh should we should we root out the tares now I'm just looking around making sure everybody's awake because if they're asleep and they don't get if they're not following each word there's gonna you can have a lot of explaining to do later at this moment as we see and I hope Genesis 1 is still in view Genesis 2 25 and that picture that we've already framed we know in Genesis 3 The Wicked one it comes sows into Humanity a mongrelizing another seed that changes everything so now the the thought is why don't we just root out that seed why don't we just bleed out the terror why don't we just breed that out why don't we just get rid of that he says no no no Let It Grow let both grow together until the Harvest now what happens in the Harvest the seeds have reached they're full maturity the seeds have proven what they are it's a full plant it has seed mature seed inside of it so everything's grow up the fruit is perfect the fruit is mature and the seed on the inside would produce exactly what's on the inside of it any earlier it's no good any later would be no good there it's at the furthest advancement of the seed at the time of the Harvest because Jesus says immediately they thrust forth the sickle and harvest and so he says let them grow together until the Harvest because if you go too early you'll uproot the wheat along with the tears so now try not to get ahead of myself this is this to me is just floors me when I see this the the the the the the wisdom of God to say oh no no no you can't do that because he knows if you move in too quickly to uproot the tears he's like don't do that because I've already sewn wheat that's already in there and at any moment this happens too quickly then all the children of the Kingdom will not be made manifest you want to know why we're still here there's no there's still wheat that's got to come up and so this once that once that wheat has manifest the last germ has manifest then God has no other purpose for time ponder that for a while he said the Harvest is the end of the world so it's at the end of the world because he said let him grow up together until the Harvest until everything's come up out of the ground the sun amount shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend Ed so the kingdom is what he wants he doesn't doesn't take the seeds and Transplant them into another world he gathers them out all things out of his kingdom the things that offend out of his kingdom he had a field he had it sowed he had it framed somebody else sold something in it he's going to address that and get rid of all the tears out of his kingdom it says and they shall be cast and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the Son and the kingdom of their father now that that brings a Jew to the kingdom that's where they're thinking Daniel chapter 2 Daniel chapter seven and now it's saying that the children of the Kingdom shall shine as the son now think of what the how Jesus there'll be no need of the son and how they'll be he'll be the light now the kingdom light the righteous shine forth as the son he says who have ears to hear Let Them hear now so that we could bring this Orient you to Genesis 2 25 brother Bannon takes this Parable and he says uh well brother Ram takes the in the beginning and he said that God placed all his seeds there and he said how did we what happened how do we come up with all these perverted seeds and he says in power of transformation and if I could say some sermons if you're looking for sermons to listen to and read uh God's power to transform and power of transformation and and future home in Christ the mystery just real short easy reading for you to dig into there or even the sermon on remarriage if you wanted to dig into that a little bit he says in all this great thing node would he could take a rest Genesis 1 Genesis 2 25 everything's there God can rest everything under control his seed was his word and his word is a seed Jesus said it was and everything would be all right because he said for to bring forth of its kind transforming only to its kind and so God sold all of his seeds into the Earth and then God took a rest on the seventh day he rested because it had all laid out there it was all there he could rest and then Brothers says when God spoke it he knew his word was a seed and it could bring forth of its kind so God created all the seed is in the Earth and he says he could rest because the seeds there in other words God doesn't need to add anything to manifest what he wants to manifest now if you could catch this it's all in the earth so God doesn't necessarily need to create anything again because the seed has already been spoken it's spoken as a word so in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 God somehow has already spoken all the word that'll ever manifest he says its first word then it materializes even Jesus Christ is the manifestation of Genesis 1 28. he says that word spoken brought forth flesh when it caught in the womb of Mary and brought forth Jesus and he was the beginning of the creation of God so God didn't have to speak again everything that he had ought was going to create was somehow I know it's kind of beyond our thinking but somehow God had spoken it and it was their invisible Supernatural in the heavens as it were waiting to materialize into something tangible and then so this is God now he's going to rest he's framed it Genesis 1 1 Genesis 25. he's going to rest and then while God was sleeping is what some places Etc as God is resting Satan slipped in and in God's power to transform her power transformation he says now here comes that slimy dirty Deceiver right he brought around is going to Great Lengths in those sermons to show us this is God everything's laid out then why do we see the sin we have because the devil slipped in as the wicked one who sowed tares in God's field he's the one that sowed the false seed into the kingdom he's the one that broke the frame of Genesis 2 25 and Genesis 1 1. he's the one that came in and interrupted things now we say oh oh no but brother Adam says when Satan did that which was necessary to fulfill the plan of God because that Adam always remained in Eden he would have never known who God was he would have only known him as this really awesome dude that comes down in the evenings and walks with me and I think he made all this right I think I'm pretty sure God's the reason why all this is here and he would have known him as a Creator and he would have known him as one who could walk with him and it just wouldn't God would be like man he doesn't even know the half of me so God could not be fully expressed with just that frame so although we can say it was Perfection and it was Sublime God still even sets himself forth in seed form in the beginning oh in Genesis 2 4-7 now Genesis chapter 2 verses 4 to 7. it says and these are the generations of the heavens and of the Earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens these are the generations these are the results in the products of the heavens and the Earth this is what was within it the day that it was recreated because to say these are the generations so it's what heaven's generated what Earth generated because it's what sprung forth from it right so if a seed generated something we wouldn't say oh this seed kind of went out there and moved it so around and moved that around and created something no it was in the seed if if a seed grows and plant and brings something forth oh that was within it that's the generation of so it is the result or the product of these are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created and the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens in other words this is seed and this is what's within the seed and notice it says in every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew in other words there was no shrub in the field yet in the earth no herb of the field had yet sprung up but the plant and the herb were already in the earth in seed form by the spoken word of God had already put it in there by the spoken word and though you don't see it as of yet the Bible tells us this is what's within the heavens this is what's within the earth when they were created every plant and every herb you know it's how we could even say that that makes it even more pronounced what brother Adams said the great Creator sent forth his word and the Word was a seed before the real seed was ever formed so there it was supernaturally spoken by God and this is the Bible saying that these are the generations this is the power and potential that's there every plant before it was in the earth and every herb before it grew existed first by word seed because this is for the Lord God had not caused it to Reign upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground so it's there already sown into the Earth the spoken word is already placed it there within the Earth but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground now as we pause on that we say this is then the process of God's creation because that's going to allow whether it be some sort of germination and bringing forth of what was in there so in the earth God speaks there's seed now there's actual seed in the earth and it has not yet produced plant or tree or fruit until the next stage of development and God allows the water to then cause it to grow these are the generations of the heavens and the Earth and and now we get this image of all of a sudden now plant life is growing and then when brother Branham describes the formation of Adam I think baby describes it even as his toes is root Roots into the soil so now notice what it says in verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul just as the plants were already in the Earth and just as the herb were already in the earth and the trees were on the earth man's body was already in the Earth so there was just these are the generations of Heaven and Earth man was first formed spirit being first Supernatural that gives him his Affinity with the heavens but now the heavens have a have a body in the earth already and so when God loves us water to come forth and each seed is bringing forth of its kind it's only natural that the body of man would come up at the same time because the body was already in the earth and it says and God formed it you know what that word formed is in the Hebrew predetermined it God predetermined the body in the earth God pre-ordained so it says God Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground it wasn't that God said hmm now let's see what would work here what would work here it's almost as if when God spoke it and then the time came for the seeds to come forth man just came right up with it because God's spoken word had said it and when the season came for to manifest God didn't have to Scurry around and get everything ready it was just there in its seasoned to come right up that's why the Bible says in Genesis 3 18 and 19 Thor's Thorns also in thistle shall it bring forth Thee the land the Earth and thou shalt eat the herb of the field I really recommend I believe the last sermon we preached saw him here I am plugging my own channel I guess I really think you should listen to that to think about how the Earth was subject to a curse until Malachi 4 came and here the Earth is cursed and thorns and thistles bring forth from uh the ground and thou shall eat the herb of the field this is this is wasn't so there Susan in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken from thus Thou Art and unto thus shalt thou return the body returns to the ground where it was originally planted that's exactly where it goes back to it goes right back into the ground where God had originally planted it Ecclesiastes he says then shall the dust return to the Earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it but I can say this this isn't the end think of this as it says you were taken out of the Dust and you go back to the Dust it is the permissive will of God to bring it back around to his perfect will God didn't allow all those elements to disintegrate and disappear forever that when man was formed from the ground he followed me are you with me when man was formed from the ground God allowed death to put it back in the place where it was before Now Catch what brother Brown says I could read to you maybe a dozen statements I'll only read to you two of them and of how brother Branham addresses this particular the thing that I'm wanting to bring before you this morning and the sermon turned on the light he says no life can come outside of light light produces light produces life there could be no life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be only light can come by the word of God God's word is a light when it's manifested these sermons that he preaches here in early 64. a lot of few of them in Arizona on uh turn on the light in Shalom there's a man here could turn on all those different things it's almost as if he could just write down everything he said yeah and so I just bought a highlighter about this big and went through the spoken wordbook because I didn't actually do that but it's it's just that powerful every step it's like get that oh yeah that that that so notice how each one of those is like principle principle principle he says there must be only light can come by the word of God God's word is light when it's manifested he said it's just a seed laying there as God planted all the seeds our bodies were on the earth before there was any life here or anything right the calcium POTUS petroleum Cosmic light whatever it was here when God created the Earth other words when God created the Earth he didn't just say well hmm dirt seems good or he's working on something over here let's say he's trying to create a star what do I do with this this is kind of grainy you know what I'll use this over here and used it to form the Earth he actually when he made the Earth he used elements that he wanted to use to make your body and if I can make this even more brother Brahm said the natural birth is even more Supernatural to him how that God watched out over jeans since the beginning that were already in the earth and knew just the way to watch over all of it so that it would produce you there's no AI out there that can do it hey this is what God he's saying our bodies were on the earth before there was any life there or anything the calcium pots petroleum caused me like whatever it was was here when God created the Earth it only took his spoken word to bring it into existence listen please just like it did botany life or tree life here it is oh whatever whatever life there is to be hell yeah but God had the prophet saved that he said that the seed is already there God planted all seeds our bodies were laying there and it takes the spoken word of God to bring it into existence whether it be botany life tree life or whatever life whatever life there is to be it's a transforming power in the seed Amen brother Adam said maybe hundreds and hundreds of years passed all this season there may be hundreds and hundreds of years passed but in its season it manifested botany life in a seasoned tree life manifested all the seeds there and brothers says it may take he's hundreds and hundreds of years could I say maybe even thousands of years but whatever life is to be it'll come up think deeply about these implications think very deeply about what it what the uh what is being implied in all of our bodies we're here on Earth and the sermon future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride I hope I spelled everything right there he said this Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose what things thorns and thistles sin cause it to be like that and when I say these things is I'm referring to a lot of the things we see now because science brought these things but he's saying that's not what the purpose was sin caused to be like that it was made by God the Creator and all our bodies that we live in now were put on the earth when God created it because you are Out of the Dust of the earth it was all laid out here now when a a builder lays his material out he doesn't just you know kind of back the trailer up and then speed off and then just let everything just slide out right they lay things out in a logical way even as brother Joel Ray was showing us this uh this high tower the skyrise that they're building there in Vancouver and just the levels that they start with and the things that they have to build before they can build and the things that have to be in place so they can place the things that they need to have in place in order to place the things they need to have the building and so when they lay everything out and they plan everything out and if you haven't planned it properly all of a sudden things will bog down and slow way down it's like oh we didn't know if we had this set right we need to do this we need to do that he says when God himself began to create he says everything is laid out here when God himself created himself created you are in his thinking so as he's as he is laying it all out here you're in his mind so he's very deliberate I'm gonna put this here I'm gonna put that there he's laying everything out of this great master builder when God created it urine is thinking and in him the great Eternal was the thought which is his attribute and now sin caused all this to happen and God through this age is gathering up his material he's Gathering up his material he didn't lay the material out in this age he laid the material in Genesis 1 but it's in this age that he gathers up all the material that he meticulously laid out oh Hallelujah already laid there in the earth the seeds of the Kingdom so when he says that they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed we say that's the family portrait Genesis 1 1 to Genesis 2 25. it's the mystery of Heaven expressed in the glory of the man and his wife naked unashamed as seeds I think deeply about this I'm making I'm making great time I'm doing awesome brother Aaron you're doing awesome you're doing good on time I think very concentrate with me I could I can wrap this up very quickly in seed form think very deeply very spiritually about this now God has always been moving towards the kingdom the seeds of the Kingdom were sown in Genesis 1. what God was going to achieve now this is if you listen to the end of this series on Wednesday then you'll understand what I was leading up to when I say this that the the Earth was not intended to be the Devil's Playground God didn't say let's give the devil a Sandbox to play in let's see what this backslidden angel can do so let's just create a Sandbox right where he can play in with all his viruses and everything he wants to do and we can just contain it here just to see what it does and then we can see how we can attack it and how we can address it that in some ways is how nominal religion wants us to view the Earth as a Sandbox for the devil to get all his viruses out and all his bad errors and all his poor programming out and it can all do this and it won't affect everything not going to affect eternity we're gonna let the devil make all his mistakes and then we'll we'll figure out what all those mistakes are and then we'll just kind of correct it in eternity and then we'll banish everything else to hell for eternity that's not time wasn't the time's purpose is not only for evil and so if we could begin to attack this idea that the Earth is a Devil's Playground and and time is only for evil then we can then it helps us to understand then the climate the darkest of all ages the climax of Satan's kingdom I want to look more at the Satan's kingdom the kingdoms of this world you're called to manifest the kingdom right now right here now wait until we get to White Throne judgment and say well what do you think you know did I make it and then and then we can shine as the sun oh there's something that has to happen now now First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 35 I'm gonna read to verse 49. and I'm going to read in a few other sermons and and a couple other places in Revelation and I may do this quickly because I'm just right at that spot where I can't stop now and um and and but I don't want to belabor some of it so I'll just come back to it at another point now you're thinking deeply you're thinking spiritually and maybe I'll just set this up for another time notice how Paul writes this because brother bam said in that threefold mystery of his of God his body that we're to bring the message in the last days and be taken up from the dead and the resurrection in this age he's Gathering up his material right there's a gathering up of all the material there's going to be those that shall not sleep it shall be changed but still all the material is going to be gathered up so he says he says this first Corinthians 15 start with verse 35 but some man will say I love how Paul anticipates the objection how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come well tell us what you really feel Paul thou full that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die this is a principle that we see in nature it's not quickened except it die oh how the devil the wicked one is snared in the works of his own hands the pit which he had dug for me he has fallen into the midst of himself he didn't know that death was necessary to Quicken the seed I know what I'll do I'll bring death and God's like oh look you do what'd you say nothing do what you need to whatever you do don't throw me in that Briar Patch right now fool that which I saw us is not quick and accept it die and that which thou sowest thou sawest not that body that shall be but bear or naked grain it may chance of wheat or some other grain you saw naked seed you don't sow the fruit the fullness you don't saw it in the glory that it will be you saw it and what it is but God giveth a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed I'm not gonna be able to read it today but he says in verse 51 behold I show you a mystery he's been speaking a mystery well before he says that and he gets to the resurrection of the seeds or the Harvest of the seeds but he's saying that God God will this is he's hearkening back to Genesis 1. he says God giveth the body as it pleased him this goes back to the languages Genesis 1 11 and the seed within itself to transform itself whose body is within itself whose life is within itself it's already in the seed to transform though it may be there naked and bare and it may look a particular way it's a seed and once it's gone through the process it'll bring forth the power and life that's inside of it that you don't yet see it may look beautiful now but you just wait you just wait when the life I gave it and the purpose I gave it just wait till it's Quicken God gave it a body as he had pleased him and to every seed this is God's program this is God's plan it gave it a body that's appropriate for whatever life there is to be thank you for whatever life there is to be so notice how beautiful this is all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another flesh of Beast another fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies embodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the son and another glory of the Moon another glory of the stars but for one star different from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the Dead how is it the dead are gonna be raised he says do you not know the principle of the seed do you not know that unless that body is sown into the Earth it cannot come up again and there may be one Glory that you see but the body that is sown is not the body that comes up it is sun and Corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sun and weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body is this raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body well he's preaching he is preaching and so it is written notice where he comes to the first Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy and the second man is the Lord of Heaven [Music] but is there not Redemption for that it's not not what the second Adam means Earth Heaven the first is natural the second is Supernatural as is the earthy so are they also that are earthy and as and as is the heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and you can almost say there's one glory and there's another Glory there's earthy there's Heavenly there's first Adam there's last Adam but then notice what he says and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of a heavenly look what he's just done that you who born the earthy who have come from the earth you too that will bear the heavenly for we shall be changed behold I show your mystery what is it it's the mystery of Heaven the mystery of Heaven is Earth and Glory we bear the image of the Earthly we'll bear the image of the heavenly this is the seeds of the Kingdom in Genesis 1. this is that no they'll come to their Harvest though Adam and the woman were there naked in Paris seeds God allowed him to go into the ground and every man after Adam has gone into the ground but just as we have borne the image of the earthy we will bear the image of the heavenly we will come into full manifestation in the sermon marriage and divorce Broadband says Genesis the seed chapter to every question in the Bible go I have to go back to the seed to see what kind of seed is in the field to find out what crops shall be this is the principle in First Corinthians 15. it's the principle in Matthew 13. now what kind of seed is on Genesis being the seed chapter we'd go back to Genesis remember good seed was sown right good seed was sown seeds of the Kingdom now the good seed that was sown I hope I'm not just opening up a gigantic Cavern that we need to mine out but before you even begin to think for a second that there's anything good and this I remember brother Donnie Reagan took a lot of heat for dramatizing someone combing their hair and saying look look and says you know something along the lines I look at you your serpent seed all right I didn't know why he took so much grief over it because we're born between Eve and Satan all right this flash is hybrid but God sowed good seed s seeds of the Kingdom so in Genesis 1 it's just the beginning and brother bam says in the sermon Satan's Eden having faith in all his word his seeds brought in Eden of Holiness love and eternal life this is just the beginning this is what he frames with Genesis 2 25. that's what God's Eden produced Holiness and it brought in Eden of Holiness of love understanding Perfection and eternal life that's what God planted that's a seed though because he says and in the end he said that's what God is planting his word his seed that's what his church will be at the end it'll be the same thing so I want to go quickly so that you can that we you can catch this perfect symmetry I'm going to fast forward to Revelations 21 because Barbara says this is what God was planting the beginning of the seed and and he and this is Paul is saying well if we born the image of the earthy and Adam was raised he was a a living soul and he was formed from the Earth but then when Christ comes and there's the key is all there in Christ the mystery is hidden Christ everything is there hidden in him he said he is now a quickening spirit and and if you if you you take that to what Paul is saying previously do you not realize that that which it's not quick and accept it die and so Christ when he dies this is part of that quickening for us but now let's go to the let's go to the end then because he saw good seed and it says in Revelations 21 . I I and I I'll just maybe read I'll stop when I we get to a point here because I think I have to seven here he says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth will pass away very very like a paradox here and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven what is it coming down to the Earth prepared as a bride adorned for her husband this is the fruit of Genesis 1. this is the fullness of God's hidden Mystery in the Earth it's no longer a bear seed it's no longer naked and unashamed but it's all in all the fruit of Heaven's Glory the man and the woman in the beginning were naked but now in the end the bride is adorned a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God the Tabernacle of God which is the heavens shall be with men which are from the earth and that God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes now notice this Eden of Holiness in the end and death and sorrow and everything Satan brought you'll gather all those things out of his kingdom he says and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away this is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the Genesis 1 1 2 25 in the Revelation 21 this is Christ this is the fullness of the seed the seeds of the Kingdom matured to their full perfection the Tabernacle of God is with men in the sermon future home of the Heavenly bridegroom an Earthly bride he says notice the Tabernacle of God will be with man notice the former things have passed away this this thing has passed away this means that heaven has come down to resident with man do you realize what he's saying it's not about going to heaven to stay in heaven that's not yes we want to go to heaven yes we can't wait till we get out of here but could I just say and I can't wait to come back and I can't wait to stay not just a thousand years but forevermore because heaven comes down and resides with man [Music] just as he has in your soul Heaven and Earth are embraced Heaven and Earth are embraced once again in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and he had this great vision and plan that one day they would be indivisible they would be forever United and so God in this program from the beginning was this Union of Heaven and Earth behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband in verse 9 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife remember he sees the city and described as a brider doing for her husband not a naked seed not a bear seed not the body that was sown but the body that would be not the first Glory but the lighter Glory the hidden Glory [Music] he said I'll show you the bride the Lamb's wife and listen he doesn't describe Genesis 1. he doesn't describe Genesis 2 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God that was the glory and the seed from the beginning it says and her light and then it begins to describe a full City all the elements that laid within the Earth everything God put in the trees everything that God put in the minerals all of you could just imagine it God laid the stones God laid the gems God laid everything in Genesis 1 and now he's taken all the material out of it and he's built himself a glorious New Jerusalem Hallelujah the seeds of the Kingdom standing in all their Glory as this beautiful city adorned and all these minerals and all these elements and all these things that would have described that were hidden there in the beginning comes back to Earth right back to Earth again but not as a seed that's being sown into death not as dust returning back to the ground but in the fullness of what it was meant to be in the beginning Hallelujah Brothers if you could come to your instruments somewhere we say that enough where they might think we have a Doctrine here that only Brothers can play instruments you think it will clarify for us please I'm just visiting today do you have a Doctrine you just kind of mention it just thinking they'll be like oh maybe they don't and you're like no we have sisters that play instruments they just don't preach behind the pulpit and Christ is the mystery of God revealed if you catch this Christ as a mystery God revealed I meant their lives are sermons I don't know what you guys are thinking oh you're thinking about the neighbor in the apartment next door and Christ is the mystery God revealed Elohim God manifest in flesh Jesus showing that he himself got in him will be manifested in his bride in the last days oh my I don't think I have that there just no end to it a revelation of God it's eternal it just keeps moving on and on and on so now here notice then one like the first Adam and Eve before sin separated them in death now Christ the second Adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original Eden restored back his bride and fellowship back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride now could I think if I could just offer this into evidence this is greater than the first because the first left the door open for failure this one seals it we can agree on that so God allowed the glory that first glory be expressed and Satan attacks it but God had hidden it already in the sea saying he's doing exactly what's necessary to bring the hidden Mystery of Heaven that's in it out he didn't Mar the Masterpiece he made it a masterpiece back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride and got it that day the kingdom is given over to the father he might be all in all he begins to quote these things why he's that speaking I'll hear David Christ David sit on the throne the king over the whole human race while they're yet thinking I'll know what they're thinking about before they speak I'll answer them the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like a book and they shall feed together and lay down they shall not hurt nor destroy my Holy Mountain notice what he's describing he's caught up in this inspiration right back exactly to eating again as hard as it can go the seeds of all the potential that Eden represented God has brought it out in its most gradient full Glory Hallelujah stand with me
