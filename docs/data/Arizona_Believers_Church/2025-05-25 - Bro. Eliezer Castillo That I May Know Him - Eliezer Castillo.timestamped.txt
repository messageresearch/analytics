[0:00] have a a a small thought. Um something
[0:04] that I know is in every every
[0:06] Christian's uh heart, a desire, and it's
[0:09] a desire of Lord, I want to know you
[0:12] more. A desire of um Lord, uh make your
[0:16] presence more known to me. Let me see
[0:19] your word more. Not so much as a
[0:21] knowledge aspect, but a personal aspect.
[0:24] Lord, I want to know you more. So, um I
[0:28] I really enjoyed the song. Brother
[0:29] Andrew saying, I believe it's fitting
[0:31] for what we're going to be speaking
[0:33] about. Lord, open my heart. Open the
[0:36] eyes of my heart, Lord. So, Philippians
[0:40] 3:10, it says, "That I may know him in
[0:44] the power and the power of his
[0:46] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[0:48] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[0:51] his
[0:52] death." Heavenly Father, Lord, we read
[0:55] your scripture. We ask a special
[0:58] blessing, Father. And we just ask that
[0:59] you continue to have your way in this
[1:01] service as you have already. Lord, just
[1:04] touch each and every person. Lord, we
[1:05] come expecting, knowing that you'll give
[1:08] to us what we need. In the name of the
[1:10] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And
[1:12] amen. Amen. You may be
[1:16] seated. So, Paul Paulie, he's um even
[1:19] though it seems simple, he's asking a
[1:21] lot. you know, you're you're talking
[1:23] about an in a finite person, somebody
[1:26] that um you know, we we receive
[1:30] knowledge as we grow up. And of course,
[1:33] there's few people that actually uh live
[1:38] up to the age of 100. A lot of times we
[1:41] just live up to 70, 80, 90 sometimes. So
[1:45] you have to think about we're
[1:46] accumulating knowledge from when we were
[1:50] babies all the way to before a hundred
[1:53] years old. We're trying to accumulate
[1:55] all of this knowledge and and to want to
[1:59] know God and to want to know who he is.
[2:03] You're you're asking a lot because
[2:04] you're you're an inf a finite person is
[2:07] asking somebody that is infinity
[2:11] that is infinite. Lord I want to know
[2:13] you. So, so to truly um there was this
[2:16] quote of Augustine Hippo. He said to
[2:18] understand God or understand it is is
[2:21] not God. To truly understand God means
[2:26] that you didn't you're not understanding
[2:28] God. You've understood something else.
[2:30] Because to truly understand God, you
[2:32] have to be outside of the limitations of
[2:35] time and space and all of those things.
[2:37] So, so we can't fully undersri uh
[2:41] understand or describe God because
[2:43] there's a a limited factor. We're finite
[2:46] and and we cannot fully grasp the
[2:49] unlimited part of God or the infinity of
[2:53] God.
[2:54] So, so as we get older, we um you know,
[2:58] we attain more knowledge, but we'll
[3:00] never be able to really receive who God
[3:04] is. And I truly believe that that's what
[3:07] the world is trying to do today. That
[3:09] they're trying to receive all of this
[3:11] knowledge in a little tiny portion of
[3:14] time and it's just impossible. So, so
[3:18] the feats that we already accomplished,
[3:20] what what we see with Albert Einstein
[3:22] and with all of these great minds, even
[3:24] though it seems great for us, it's not
[3:27] even a speck of what truly is out there
[3:31] because we're trying to to to understand
[3:34] something that we will never be able to
[3:36] grasp in our finite minds. So Paul, he's
[3:40] asking something great. Lord, I want to
[3:42] know you. That's what we want today.
[3:46] Lord, I want to know
[3:48] you. Now, it it's not just so so to try
[3:54] to grasp him, it's just impossible. So,
[3:56] it's not just thinking that he's bigger
[3:58] than our imagination or or that he
[4:01] exists in in a higher plane, but he's
[4:04] he's far beyond that. He's greater than
[4:07] those things. He he's it it reminds me
[4:11] of of whenever a lot of times when we
[4:14] want to step into eternity, we want to
[4:16] step into the eternal day. We think that
[4:19] when we go into eternity that now we
[4:22] have a lot of
[4:23] time but but that's impossible because
[4:27] it's outside of the dimension of time
[4:30] completely. So, so even in our minds
[4:33] when we say, man, when we're going to be
[4:34] in that eternal day and then we're going
[4:36] to be there for years and billions of
[4:38] years and billions of years, it's
[4:40] impossible because it's outside of the
[4:42] dimension of time, space, and all of
[4:45] those things.
[4:47] So, we can't grasp God. We can't grasp
[4:50] eternity.
[4:52] God, he himself has to accommodate
[4:55] himself to our finitude.
[4:58] He has to come down to us. so that we
[5:01] can know him. It's not that we can grasp
[5:04] something great. This revelation that we
[5:07] have that that was given to us is not
[5:10] because we're great people. It's because
[5:13] somebody condescended down and gave us
[5:16] something that we can digest.
[5:19] Something we can receive from God.
[5:22] That's why in in in John 4 uh 19 when it
[5:26] says we love him because he first loved
[5:28] us, there's an
[5:30] accommodation. There's a stepping down
[5:33] first so that we could receive.
[5:36] So in order for you to know him or in
[5:38] order for you to love him, in order for
[5:40] you to grasp him, he has to do the act
[5:43] first. there there is no knowing him by
[5:47] by our mental knowledge or or anything
[5:49] or what's going to happen is we sum him
[5:54] up and we we I don't care if you're
[5:57] you're Elon Musk or you're Albert
[5:59] Einstein. If you begin to think about
[6:01] God, you automatically put him in a box
[6:04] and you limit him trying to
[6:07] intellectually understand who God is.
[6:10] That's why it might sound bad, but you
[6:13] can't even sum them up through this
[6:14] Bible.
[6:16] Well, this is the word of God. Yeah, but
[6:18] it takes revelation.
[6:21] The prophet said that it's in between
[6:23] the lines. So, you can give this Bible
[6:26] to somebody and they'll take control of
[6:28] the whole entire world. That's what the
[6:30] Catholicism did. They took this sword
[6:33] and they controlled the world and their
[6:35] hearts were still wrong. they they still
[6:37] didn't have a grasp of what the word
[6:39] was, but they used it for their own
[6:41] benefit. Or they can receive this word
[6:45] and they can say, "Oh man, God was a
[6:47] horrible God, man. How could how could
[6:49] he allow the Jews to slaughter all those
[6:52] people? It's it's a genocide." That's
[6:53] what we're hearing today. Now, that's
[6:55] giving them right away to say, "Get rid
[6:59] of the Jews." Because they see these
[7:00] things in the Bible and they say, "Look
[7:02] at how horrible your God is."
[7:05] So, they're summing God up by reading
[7:07] this Bible. But it takes more than just
[7:10] reading
[7:11] the the words on pages.
[7:15] It takes God accommodating himself into
[7:19] our weakness, into our life.
[7:23] And and and and even to say, "Lord, I I
[7:26] love you." Or to understand his love.
[7:29] He's not composed of of hearts. He's not
[7:31] composed of like certain emotions like
[7:34] we are like, you know, maybe somebody
[7:36] can get frustrated. That's an emotion
[7:38] that we that's raised up in our lives. I
[7:41] can't sum up by that because that's
[7:43] probably not who you are.
[7:46] So So we have extensions of our life. We
[7:49] have emotions. We have characteristics
[7:51] that sum us all up. We're soul, body,
[7:55] and spirit. Those are three things that
[7:57] sum sum us up. That's what brings us
[8:01] together. God, when it says God is love,
[8:04] he is holy and completely love. It's not
[8:08] that he is loving. When it says God is
[8:10] just, it's not that he has a a aspect of
[8:14] justice, but he that's who he is.
[8:18] It's his wholeness. It's not just a part
[8:20] of him. That's why when we are his
[8:22] attributes, we're not an extension of
[8:24] him. We are him. We are part of God.
[8:30] So even in in in Romans 3:10 where it
[8:35] says as it is written there is none
[8:37] righteous know not one. There is not
[8:41] none that understandeth there is none
[8:43] that seeketh after God. So it's showing
[8:46] that there is no one righteous outside
[8:48] of God. There's no one that understands
[8:51] God and there is no one that can seek
[8:54] him. So we almost we don't have the
[8:58] capability of even reaching God if we
[9:00] wanted to
[9:02] to know him know him. You'll never be
[9:05] able to. It's him giving us the capacity
[9:09] to know him. If if you have a desire for
[9:13] him, that's the amazing thing. If you
[9:15] have a desire for him, it's because
[9:17] somebody has already dropped the
[9:19] lifeline.
[9:21] So if if you always if someone feels
[9:23] like, man, I I just can't reach God. I
[9:26] just can't I can't get to him. But you
[9:28] already have a desire, it means God
[9:31] already put the capacity in you to want
[9:35] to serve him.
[9:37] Or else you wouldn't have it. We would
[9:39] be just like the world. We wouldn't have
[9:41] that desire to want to know him. So even
[9:45] to have the desire, God puts that desire
[9:49] in us. Isaiah 55:6, it clearly says it.
[9:53] It says, "Seek the Lord while he may be
[9:56] found. Call upon him while he is near."
[10:00] So this is the thought of of God opening
[10:03] a
[10:04] door, saying now this is a chance to
[10:07] seek him because he is able to be found.
[10:11] call upon him because right now he is
[10:14] near. But there's there's a point a time
[10:18] where where that's not the case. You can
[10:21] call, you can cry, he will not answer.
[10:25] We seek him, we will not find him. We
[10:27] will find him intellectually, but we
[10:29] won't know who he is. As he is near, he
[10:33] gives us the capacity or the capability
[10:36] of understanding.
[10:38] And it's not that we understand him and
[10:40] and it's just impossible to understand
[10:43] him. We understand what he wants us to
[10:46] understand. He gives us what he wants us
[10:49] to know.
[10:52] It's all God. It's all by his grace.
[10:56] Brother Brandham said that faith is by
[10:58] grace and faith is revelation. So, so
[11:02] the only time revelation is not a feat
[11:06] that we go through or or something that
[11:08] we accomplish. It's not something that
[11:10] we can brag about. It's not something
[11:12] that we can be like, "Oh, well, we are
[11:14] the bride. We have revelation." No, it
[11:16] was by grace.
[11:18] That's the only thing.
[11:21] Grace brings I I mean, uh, revelation
[11:24] automatically comes with humbleness
[11:26] because it's not of ourselves.
[11:28] So this is the thought that God, he
[11:31] makes himself available to
[11:34] us. This is God hiding in
[11:37] simplicity. He's making himself
[11:39] available. It doesn't mean that he's
[11:41] simple. It means that he makes himself
[11:43] available to the least of us. So when he
[11:47] hides himself in simplicity, he reveals
[11:49] himself to the simple. Isn't that
[11:52] amazing how how God he has himself to
[11:56] reveal himself. He has to hide himself
[11:59] so that we could truly see him.
[12:04] Lord, brother Brandham, he says this in
[12:06] the message uh birth pains paragraph 18.
[12:09] He says, "Oh, it's glorious life. Isn't
[12:12] it brethren? To walk in the simplicity
[12:14] of the gospel and yet in its simplicity,
[12:18] it's the greatest thing I know of. I
[12:21] know nothing of it." So he's saying to
[12:23] live in the simplicity, but it's the
[12:25] greatest
[12:27] Then he says, "And being that it was
[12:29] made simple that I had a chance to come
[12:32] into it." See, too by the grace of God.
[12:37] Why did he make himself simple? So that
[12:40] we had a chance.
[12:42] He he condescended down. He made He
[12:45] condidated to our weakness, to our
[12:48] thoughts, to our abilities because if he
[12:51] didn't do it, we wouldn't it would pass
[12:54] right by us. It's just like dimensions,
[12:57] you know. Um, you you you have a
[12:59] two-dimensional creature. What it'll
[13:01] never know what three dimensions are.
[13:03] It's outside of its capacity. That's who
[13:07] God
[13:08] is. So, so we in bringing it more down,
[13:13] we can't
[13:15] assume God either in our own lives, in
[13:18] our personal lives. And a lot of times
[13:21] we put God box through our doubt through
[13:24] the things that we're going through. Um
[13:27] so it's not something we can imagine or
[13:30] or or all those things or what we do is
[13:33] we begin to make him small. He's
[13:36] infinite. He's not bound by time. He's
[13:38] he's not bound by logic or emotion or
[13:41] weakness like we are. That's right. We
[13:44] box him in. When we replace the true and
[13:46] living God with a manageable p
[13:49] predictable vision of him, when we begin
[13:52] to to try to understand him in the
[13:56] things that we're going through, when we
[13:58] try to figure things out and say, "Why
[14:00] am I going through those things?" or or
[14:02] figure him out in in other things and
[14:04] doctrinal points. When we try to start
[14:06] doing those things, we begin to make him
[14:10] small and and boxing him in
[14:14] It it's it's whenever we're going
[14:15] through those things, we try to do those
[14:17] things, but and it's not a literal
[14:19] confining God, but it's a mental,
[14:22] emotional, spiritual limitations that we
[14:24] put on God, how he should act and and
[14:28] all those things, but we have to go
[14:30] outside of that. We have to break every
[14:31] single thing that we know of God. And
[14:33] when Paul, he was saying, "I want to
[14:35] know him." He he was before that he's
[14:39] saying I count my knowledge a loss.
[14:43] I I I count these things a loss. I I I
[14:46] count my suffering as gain. He's I don't
[14:48] want anything else but to know him. So
[14:51] it was a breaking down of himself. No
[14:54] matter what he was going through,
[14:56] whatever he was that what situation he
[14:58] was in, we have to break down our own
[15:01] preconceptions of who God is.
[15:04] And it's not it's not that we hear it
[15:06] from behind the pulpit. We hear the
[15:08] prophet saying those. We create those
[15:10] things ourselves.
[15:11] We begin to create these things when
[15:13] we're in the situation we're in. But
[15:17] when we break through all those things
[15:18] and say, "Lord, you are God. You and you
[15:22] put him where he's supposed to be in the
[15:24] word," then he will reveal himself to
[15:27] you.
[15:28] So we can't reduce him to what feels
[15:31] manageable or predictable or comfortable
[15:33] to
[15:34] us. Brother Brandham, he says in as I
[15:36] thought on my ways, he says God is
[15:39] infinite. When he speaks, it's got to be
[15:42] perfect. He cannot change. We cannot
[15:46] alter God's word. We have to alter our
[15:49] thinking to his thinking.
[15:52] We can't get this word and make it the
[15:54] way we want it. That's what
[15:55] denominations have done. That's what all
[15:58] these churches, they they want to alter
[16:00] God's word to what they want.
[16:04] They want their own filter.
[16:06] We alter our thinking to him because he
[16:10] already came down. He already
[16:11] accommodated himself to us. So, so Paul,
[16:15] he's saying I that I may know him. I
[16:19] want to know him under his condition.
[16:23] See, I want to know God under God's
[16:27] condition. This isn't just a casual
[16:31] acquaintance, but
[16:35] it's it's Paul speaking of of something
[16:38] intimate, an ex an experiential
[16:41] knowledge of who Christ
[16:42] is. He isn't uh content about knowing
[16:46] about Jesus. He wants to know him
[16:49] personally, deeply in every aspect of
[16:51] his life. Ephesians 3:19, it says, "And
[16:56] to know the love of Christ, which passes
[17:00] knowledge, that ye may be filled with
[17:03] all the fullness of God." This reflects
[17:06] a relationship where the heart, the
[17:08] soul, the mind, they're all fully
[17:10] engaged. Paul desires to continually
[17:13] grow in relationship with Christ, to
[17:16] walk with him, to hear him, and to
[17:18] become more like him. If you listen to
[17:21] that or read that scripture, that's what
[17:23] he wants. I want to know you in your own
[17:26] life, in your resurrection, in
[17:29] suffering. I want to step into your
[17:31] life. I want to become like you. That's
[17:34] how I want to know you. and and in and a
[17:37] personal relationship.
[17:39] And I think um the the reason we have
[17:43] this desire is because he wants to be
[17:46] known.
[17:48] It's not when it says, "Oh, the
[17:50] mysteries and the mysteries in the
[17:52] Bible," it doesn't mean that God is
[17:54] hiding things from us, but but God, he
[17:57] intends to reveal it to those that want
[18:00] it.
[18:02] Amen. So, so the reason we have a desire
[18:04] to want him, we have a desire to to want
[18:08] to serve him and to want to know who he
[18:10] is is because he wants to be known.
[18:13] I think brother Brandham, he he really
[18:16] paints a beautiful picture of how he
[18:18] desired to be known and the
[18:20] circumstances in between. Here in uh in
[18:24] uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[18:26] in paragraph 141. He says the first
[18:29] thing God was God wanted to reveal
[18:32] himself to the people. He couldn't do it
[18:35] as the great Jehovah God who covered all
[18:37] spaceime and eternity. He could not.
[18:40] He's too great to ever be revealed to
[18:42] the people because it would be too
[18:44] mysterious.
[18:46] How could that great being that never
[18:48] did begin and after you went beyond a
[18:50] cycle of a hundred and billions and
[18:52] trillions and trillions of years of
[18:55] light space and on into the infinite
[18:59] into eternity that great creature that
[19:01] was and all that and still is. So all of
[19:06] that brother Brandham tried to use his
[19:08] own words to explain this God. Now, if
[19:12] you try to understand what he said, the
[19:14] tr billions and billions and trillions
[19:15] and trillions of years of light space,
[19:18] that's a
[19:20] lot. That is a lot. And that still
[19:23] doesn't contain him. And now, but but
[19:27] all of that, all of that expansion, all
[19:31] of that beyondness wants to be known by
[19:34] you and I. Isn't that beautiful?
[19:38] He wants to be known. He wants to be
[19:41] revealed to
[19:43] you. That's beautiful. So he's not
[19:46] absent from this world. He's not
[19:48] distant, but he's hiding
[19:51] within the veil. It conceives this
[19:54] divine God, not with distance or
[19:57] inaccessibility, but the dullness of our
[20:00] perception. That's it. God is
[20:03] everywhere. God is here. Amen. But if if
[20:06] if we're trying to perceive him, we'll
[20:09] he'll always be hidden to us. If we try
[20:12] to intellectually re receive him, he'll
[20:15] always be hidden and it'll seem like
[20:17] there is no God. It'll seem like there
[20:19] he's never been here, but he's here.
[20:23] Uh uh David said, uh where can I hide
[20:26] from you? I can't go to heaven and I
[20:29] can't go to the deepest parts of hell.
[20:31] You'll be there.
[20:33] showing his great uh
[20:37] omniresence, showing that he knows all
[20:39] things that he's but he's hidden. He's
[20:43] hidden by our own perceptions of him.
[20:46] And you you see this where where he
[20:49] begins to hide himself in veils. And
[20:52] brother Brandham really goes into it in
[20:54] in God um hiding himself in simplicity
[20:58] and Christ the mystery of God revealed
[21:00] and and uh the unveiling of God. He
[21:02] really goes into how he hides himself in
[21:05] veils to reveal a portion of his
[21:09] character. So he'll go and he'll hide
[21:11] himself in a whirlwind and he's he's
[21:14] revealing a portion of his character to
[21:16] the people doing
[21:19] that. Even in in um with Adam and
[21:22] Eve, if you think about it, in Adam and
[21:25] Eve, they were perfect. They weren't in
[21:28] sin like we we all are in. They weren't
[21:31] born in sin. They were made
[21:33] perfect. And so you have to think that
[21:36] the fullness of God was with
[21:38] them. There was nothing to hide. There
[21:42] was nothing to hide from them because
[21:45] they weren't in sin. They were in
[21:50] eternity. He didn't hold back his
[21:52] holiness from them. There was no sin
[21:54] there.
[21:56] But Adam and Eve never saw the fullness
[21:59] of who God was.
[22:01] How could you know God showing himself
[22:05] his fullness there but that they
[22:07] couldn't see the fullness of who he
[22:10] was? It's because to see God doesn't
[22:13] just truly just doesn't mean to see him
[22:15] physically. It's not a physical thing.
[22:18] Brother Brandham, he says that he said
[22:20] what is God's purpose? This is in uh
[22:22] Christ the mystery of God revealed. He
[22:24] said what was God's purpose or what um
[22:27] see what God purpose was? Now, why
[22:30] didn't he keep Adam and Eve like that?
[22:33] Then he would never be able to express
[22:35] his fullness, his full
[22:37] attribute. So, even though he was there
[22:40] fully, he couldn't truly express his
[22:44] fullness.
[22:46] You, how can you know somebody if they
[22:48] don't fully express themselves, right?
[22:50] They can be around you, they can hang
[22:52] around, but if they don't fully express
[22:54] themselves to you, then how how do you
[22:57] know? So he it's that he didn't fully
[22:59] express himself to them. That's right.
[23:02] Because he could have been a father
[23:04] there. Yes, that's or that's true. But
[23:07] also he's a savior. You say how how do
[23:10] you know he was? Cuz I've had the
[23:13] experience. See see he is a savior and
[23:16] he had to express that. How could he do
[23:19] it? Only through Christ.
[23:21] How could he be a son? Only through
[23:23] Christ. How could he be a healer? only
[23:26] through Christ. See, all things wound up
[23:29] in that person, Jesus Christ. Oh my. And
[23:33] I I love how he says, "When I think
[23:35] about this, all denominations pass off
[23:37] the team." Why? Because it's not church.
[23:41] It's not just organization and it's not
[23:44] moving parts and all of these things,
[23:46] but it's God revealing himself to us
[23:49] completely. Amen.
[23:52] That's that was that was uh Moses's
[23:55] desire desire. You know, in in uh Exodus
[23:58] 32, a horrible situation happened. God
[24:02] gave Moses the Ten Commandments. And as
[24:05] he was up there, of course, the the
[24:08] people began to say, "Well, we don't
[24:10] have a prophet anymore." And they wanted
[24:12] to erect a golden calf. So, they go and
[24:15] they sit against the Lord. And God comes
[24:18] back down and and he sees this whole
[24:20] thing and and uh judgment takes place
[24:23] there and and finally after 32, God
[24:30] speaks to Moses
[24:32] again and God says, "I'm going to give
[24:34] you the land still." So, he was still
[24:37] going to give him the land even though
[24:39] they they made this great sin, but he
[24:42] said, "I'm send my angel."
[24:45] He he tried to to sneak in. I'm going to
[24:48] send my
[24:49] angel. I'm not going with you because I
[24:53] you are an unsuffering, stiff necked
[24:55] people. So, I'm not going to go with
[24:58] you. I'm going to send somebody
[25:00] else. And and Moses comes and it says
[25:03] that he's talking face to face with God
[25:05] and he says, "I don't want to go if you
[25:08] don't go." That's the desire of us.
[25:11] Lord, if you're not with me, I don't
[25:13] want to continue. Lord, if your presence
[25:15] isn't with me, I I'm not going wherever
[25:18] I'm supposed to go.
[25:20] So he says, Lord, show me your way. In
[25:23] in chapter
[25:24] 33, he says, "Show me your way that I
[25:27] may know
[25:28] thee that I may find grace in thy sight
[25:32] and consider that this nation is thy
[25:35] people." And in verse 14, he says, he
[25:39] said, "My presence shall go with you, go
[25:43] with thee. and I will give thee rest.
[25:46] And here Moses, he clarifies. He said
[25:49] unto him, if thy presence go not with
[25:51] me, carry us not up hence. I don't want
[25:54] to go if you don't go. And and God
[25:58] begins to talk to him and said, "Yes, I
[25:59] will be there because you found uh grace
[26:02] in my sight."
[26:06] And and here when they're talking
[26:08] one-on-one, he says,
[26:10] "Lord, you know, when when you get close
[26:12] enough to the Lord, when you begin to
[26:15] serve him all of your heart, your desire
[26:18] is to want to know him more and more and
[26:21] more. We're never satisfied in not not
[26:24] wanting more. We're we're
[26:27] always we're always striving to see God
[26:31] more. And here, he's so intimate. There
[26:34] there has been no man that has ever
[26:37] spoke to God face to face. And yet he
[26:40] was bold enough to say, "Lord, let me
[26:42] see your
[26:44] glory. Let me see you,
[26:46] Lord. Let me get to know you. Let me
[26:50] know who you are." And God prepared and
[26:54] he said, "I will show you. And as I pass
[26:57] by, I'm going to give you my
[26:59] characteristics. I'm going to tell you
[27:00] who I am." So God, he prepared it. He
[27:04] said, "You're going to hide in the left
[27:06] of the rock and I'm going to pass by."
[27:07] And and he began to do all that. And
[27:09] before he even did that, they he
[27:11] restored the word. He restored the Ten
[27:15] Commandments. And as the Ten
[27:17] Commandments were restored, then God
[27:19] showed him his
[27:21] glory. The Bible, Brother Brandon says
[27:24] that wasn't the fullness of his glory.
[27:27] God said to him, he said, "You can't see
[27:29] all of me. You can't see all of my
[27:32] glory. What was it? It was just a
[27:35] portion. God only revealed a little bit
[27:38] to them, to him. And when he saw him, it
[27:43] says that his face
[27:45] shined a and and when he went down, the
[27:49] people begin to see God through him. And
[27:52] and and that's the reality of a
[27:55] Christian that that when you get to know
[27:58] who God is, then God begins to show
[28:02] himself or declare himself through you.
[28:07] That's amazing.
[28:09] That's beautiful. It says whenever in in
[28:12] fir 2 Corinthians 3:18 it says when we
[28:15] with all unveiled face beholding the
[28:17] glory of the Lord are being transformed
[28:19] into the same image from one degree of
[28:22] glory to
[28:23] another. This comes from the Lord and
[28:26] who who um from the Lord who is the
[28:28] spirit.
[28:30] This is uh the uh ESV version but it's
[28:34] showing that when we see his glory we
[28:37] get transformed into his glory. We
[28:40] become like him. The more glory we
[28:44] behold is the more glory we
[28:46] become. So Moses was the only one that
[28:50] saw God but he was the one that declared
[28:54] God to the people. I believe that's the
[28:57] ministry of us today.
[29:00] that God God has to be declared by a
[29:02] people. God has to be declared by a life
[29:06] just as our our pastor has been
[29:08] preaching the
[29:10] witnessing. How do we declare God? How
[29:12] do we witness to God? Whenever we're in
[29:15] his presence, whenever we know him, then
[29:19] we show
[29:20] him. I remember Philip, he was saying,
[29:24] he was saying, "Show us the Father and
[29:26] it'll satisfy us." And and Jesus said,
[29:29] he said, 'Haven't I been so long with
[29:31] you? Haven't I been so long? He says,
[29:34] 'He that seeth me seeth the father.
[29:38] John 1:18, it says, "No man hath seen
[29:40] God at any time, only the begotten son
[29:43] which is in the bosom of the father. He
[29:45] hath declared him." What was it? It was
[29:48] the son that was in the presence. And
[29:51] when the son came out, then he was
[29:54] declaring the father.
[29:57] John 14:17 it says, "Even the spirit of
[29:59] the truth, where the world cannot
[30:02] receive, because it seeth him not,
[30:04] neither knoweth him, but ye know him,
[30:07] for he dwelleth with you, and he shall
[30:09] be in you." So you know him.
[30:14] You know who he is. And because of that,
[30:17] you declare him.
[30:19] Because you know who he is, he dwelleth
[30:21] with you and in you.
[30:25] So now when people say, "Well, well,
[30:27] show us the Father, show us Christ."
[30:30] Well, h hasn't the bride been here long
[30:32] enough? Hasn't the children of God been
[30:35] here long enough where they basking in
[30:38] his glory?
[30:40] That's truly getting to know God where
[30:43] he allows us to enter into his presence,
[30:46] to know his word, even though we're
[30:48] nobody's. And when we go out into the
[30:51] world, we declare the Father.
[30:54] So now we see throughout the whole Bible
[30:57] the um men were able to see the glimpses
[31:00] of God in different forms and every form
[31:02] he came it was showed uh it would take
[31:06] them out of their condition for their
[31:07] day where it was a pillar of fire. God
[31:10] would say I am the I am or if it was
[31:12] Melkisedc then he would he would uh show
[31:15] himself a certain way so that he could
[31:18] take the people out from the condition
[31:20] that they were in.
[31:23] So he always he comes in a specific form
[31:27] according to the work he does. And when
[31:30] he came in the form of Jesus Christ, he
[31:32] was a baby in a
[31:33] manger. Imagine a man subject to time,
[31:36] sickness of the body, subject to trials
[31:39] of the mind. So in the flesh, what did
[31:42] he do? What was why did he come in this
[31:45] form? Because he wanted to do the work
[31:48] of redeeming the whole world. In Hebrews
[31:52] 2:14 it says,
[31:54] "For for much for as much then as the
[31:58] children are partakers of the flesh and
[32:00] blood, he also himself likewise took
[32:03] part of the same and through death that
[32:06] he may destroy him that had the power of
[32:09] death that is the devil."
[32:12] So we are childrens that are partakers
[32:16] of flesh and blood. He had to come that
[32:21] way. He had to come in that way, be
[32:23] partaker of that so that he could take
[32:26] that power out. And you know, some
[32:29] people can look at this and begin to
[32:31] criticize and and see the simplicity of
[32:33] of Christ and deny that that could be
[32:36] God.
[32:37] But not you have to know that he came to
[32:41] accommodate our weakness. Amen. So he
[32:44] came in the form in flesh and
[32:48] blood. So you want to know him, he's
[32:52] going to come to your
[32:53] level. You want him, he will come to
[32:56] where you're at and that's where he'll
[32:59] you'll see himself.
[33:01] This is the ultimate act of making
[33:03] himself known. Brother Brandham, he says
[33:05] in the unveiling of God, he says God
[33:09] veiled in Jesus to do the work of
[33:11] redemption at the cross.
[33:14] God could not die as a spirit. He is
[33:17] eternal. But he had to make he had to
[33:20] put on a mask and act a part of death.
[33:23] He did die. But he could not do it in um
[33:26] his his god form. He had to come or he
[33:30] had to do it in the sun form as the son
[33:33] of man on earth. See he had to be son
[33:37] form. Now what form is he in today? So
[33:41] every act, every work that he does in
[33:44] every age, he has to come in certain
[33:46] form to reveal himself to the people.
[33:49] What form is he in today? And what work
[33:51] is he doing today?
[33:54] Amen. He says, well here, brother
[33:58] Brandham says answers the question. He
[34:00] says, can't you see where we're
[34:02] standing? Life is in the grain again.
[34:05] What is it? Just exactly like the same
[34:07] grain that it went into the ground. The
[34:09] same Jesus in bride form. Same power,
[34:13] same church, same thing, same word. So
[34:16] what form is he in today? He's in bride
[34:19] form. He is declaring himself to the
[34:25] people. So every form is specific
[34:28] according to the work that he's that
[34:30] he's doing. And um you know, you start
[34:33] to think
[34:34] about wanting to know God and expecting
[34:37] God and expecting his return. And you
[34:39] you about the Jews expecting him in in
[34:42] their
[34:43] day and and they had this preconception
[34:46] and and you have to think about it in
[34:48] our day, this this great coming of the
[34:51] Lord. What what are
[34:54] we what has come and what is
[34:57] coming? The Jews, they were waiting for
[35:01] for they already had a
[35:03] preconceived thought of who this Christ
[35:06] was going to
[35:07] be. So when they he came in a regular
[35:10] man, they rejected him. Their eyes were
[35:14] veiled to their ignorance, to their
[35:18] understanding. Their eyes were veiled
[35:21] through all of those things.
[35:26] They judged him by the law and they they
[35:28] didn't even understand the
[35:30] law. They believed God, but they limited
[35:33] him to the past.
[35:36] So, so when you want to know who God is,
[35:39] you want to know where where where do we
[35:42] have him? What category do we have him
[35:44] in? When we're waiting for him, where is
[35:47] he? What is he supposed what
[35:50] preconceived thought that that the world
[35:54] is is giving today where say this is God
[35:57] this is how he's supposed to be and we
[35:59] begin to create a box around him and we
[36:03] begin to expect him that way
[36:07] and when he came that way they said whoa
[36:11] this guy's a blasphemer this guy's a
[36:13] drunker this guy's this guy's that
[36:16] brother Brandham says in the unveiling
[36:17] of God he God veiled in a form of a man
[36:20] hid himself from their view.
[36:23] So it wasn't that that God intentionally
[36:25] hid
[36:28] himself. That's what this veil does. He
[36:31] says they could only see a man, but
[36:33] those predestinated seen God.
[36:39] He says one saw a man, the other one saw
[36:42] God. See it was God failed in a human
[36:47] being making both of them right but your
[36:50] faith is in what you don't see.
[36:53] So so both of them were right. One saw
[36:57] veil and the other one saw
[36:59] beyond. One saw who God truly is.
[37:04] That's that's the life that we're living
[37:05] in today. What form of God are you
[37:08] seeing? It might be right, but it's not
[37:11] going to bring your salvation. It's not
[37:14] going to bring the rapture. It's not
[37:16] going to bring a transformation. But
[37:18] when you see him behind the veil, when
[37:21] you see him who he truly is, there's a
[37:24] transformation.
[37:27] You know the amazing thing? Um, if you'd
[37:29] like to turn with me to Matthew
[37:33] 3:11
[37:35] to13, here's John the messenger, the
[37:42] Elijah, and he has one
[37:45] message to present the coming of the
[37:49] Lord, to show who he is, to prepare the
[37:54] way. That's what this Elijah was for.
[37:58] This is the same Elijah or the same
[38:01] spirit, the same commission that this
[38:04] one in this day is doing and did. He
[38:09] said, he begins to explain and to um
[38:12] show who this Christ is and and show his
[38:15] characteristics and what he's going to
[38:17] do. He says, "Indeed, I baptize you with
[38:20] water unto repentance, but he that
[38:22] cometh after me is mightier than I." So
[38:26] now he's mighty in whose shoes I'm not
[38:29] worthy to
[38:30] bear. He'll baptize you with the Holy
[38:33] Ghost and fire. What a man. What a God.
[38:38] Whose whose fan is in his hand and he
[38:40] will thoroughly purge the floor, gather
[38:42] the wheat unto the garden, and he'll
[38:44] burn up the shaft and with unquenchable
[38:48] fire. What a message of who this Christ
[38:52] was the one to come. this is the one
[38:56] that's going to come. He's going to
[38:58] baptize you with a Holy Ghost and fire.
[39:02] Then maybe mid mid preaching, he turns
[39:07] and he sees the Christ that's supposed
[39:09] to come.
[39:12] He sees a little little guy, stoop
[39:15] shoulder, 50-year-old looking guy. The
[39:18] only way he was able to understand that
[39:20] that was him because the sign of the
[39:22] dove.
[39:24] And then Jesus come from Galilee
[39:28] uh to the Jordan unto John to be
[39:30] baptized of
[39:32] him. And there they understood this is
[39:36] the Christ. Now you have to understand
[39:38] the message of the
[39:41] prophet. He he prophesied. This is
[39:44] brother Brandham says in the testimony
[39:46] of a true witness. He's explaining what
[39:47] brother uh what John the Baptist message
[39:50] was. He prophesied there would come the
[39:54] witness of the church, the Holy
[39:57] Ghost. So he was
[39:59] preaching and explaining somebody that
[40:02] was that was in
[40:04] Pentecost and and and farther down in
[40:07] the
[40:07] future. He wasn't even explaining the
[40:11] three and a half years that Jesus was
[40:13] going to come. He didn't say there
[40:15] behold there will be one that's coming
[40:17] that's stoop shouldered and he's going
[40:18] to die for our sins. He will suffer all
[40:21] things. He didn't explain that. That
[40:25] wasn't his word.
[40:27] He explained that there was going to be
[40:29] one that was going to baptize him with
[40:31] the Holy Ghost and fire. Then he takes
[40:34] him all the way to the end time, all the
[40:36] way plumbed to the millennium and says,
[40:39] "Yeah, and the fan is in his hands and
[40:41] he's going to thoroughly floors.
[40:44] gather the wheat to the gardener and he
[40:46] was going to burn the chaff with
[40:48] unquenchable fire.
[40:50] He was talking of a Christ to come in
[40:53] the future.
[40:55] And when the Christ
[40:57] came, he wasn't it thought what people
[41:01] thought he was going to be.
[41:05] So, so what Christ is here and what
[41:08] Christ are waiting for.
[41:11] That's why hearing brother um Aaron
[41:13] explain uh souls in prison situations
[41:18] happened where brother Brandham says is
[41:20] this the end?
[41:22] Are are we in the end time now? Because
[41:24] because he came yet he wasn't in the
[41:28] form that we thought he was going to be
[41:29] in
[41:31] and people are still
[41:33] waiting yet he's here
[41:37] and yet we're waiting. Isn't that
[41:39] amazing? There was one time where where
[41:42] Jesus was was talking to the woman the
[41:45] well at the well and he he begins to
[41:46] talk very strange to her. She's sitting
[41:49] there and he's sitting there and and and
[41:51] and she begins to say, "Well, there's
[41:53] going to be a time when all this stuff
[41:56] happens where the spirit and they begin
[41:58] to talk about the spirit and truth and
[42:00] all of these things." And he says, "And
[42:03] the time is," what does he say? He says
[42:06] it will come and is
[42:09] here. Very strange talk where he says
[42:12] it's going to happen but it's here
[42:14] already.
[42:16] There there was this junction time that
[42:18] they were living in to where yes the
[42:21] spirit of God was going to come down but
[42:23] I'm already here.
[42:25] That there was something supposed to
[42:27] happen out there but I am in your midst
[42:29] now. I am in your presence.
[42:34] So that was the
[42:37] picture. And now brother Brandham says
[42:40] in modern um events are made clear by
[42:42] prophecy. He says that John John's eagle
[42:45] eye began to be filmed over. He was in a
[42:48] prison. He was fixing to die and said go
[42:51] ask him. See John John said oh his fan
[42:55] is in his hand. He'll thoroughly purge
[42:57] the floor. He thought the millennium
[43:00] would start right then. He thought the
[43:03] grain was ready, but it had to die and
[43:05] go into the stock and come up again and
[43:07] make the true bride. See, that's in our
[43:11] day. But it had to die. Um Oh, yeah. And
[43:14] he said he'll gather the wheat into the
[43:16] gardener and he'll burn the fire. Watch
[43:19] the foreigner of Christ that age what he
[43:22] said would happen. The grain.
[43:26] So, so he thought it was going to be a
[43:28] certain way. Whenever his eagle eyes
[43:30] came, you know, filmed, he said, "Whoa,
[43:33] is this him?" But it it was Christ
[43:36] coming and making himself
[43:39] known. And and and the amazing thing is
[43:42] during his earthly ministry in this
[43:45] where everybody thought he was going to
[43:46] be in a different way. Everybody thought
[43:48] he was going to be a king and it was
[43:50] going to change the government. And
[43:52] everybody that disciples, Pharisees,
[43:56] everybody thought this was going to be
[43:58] the one that was going to change things.
[44:00] It wasn't going to be a religious
[44:01] movement or it wasn't going to be a
[44:03] church. It was going to be a kingdom
[44:05] that was going to overthrow
[44:08] Rome. So, everybody thought that. But
[44:12] then here he comes in a different form
[44:14] and and he begins to reveal himself
[44:17] publicly to
[44:18] everybody. But just as brother Brandham
[44:20] says, he was he was a man. So he was
[44:24] veiled to those that didn't believe and
[44:26] he was revealed to those that wanted him
[44:29] that wanted to know him. Amen. So So
[44:32] then
[44:33] you despite of his openness, many didn't
[44:37] understand him. He came to his own and
[44:39] his own did not receive him.
[44:42] But then you had these pockets of people
[44:45] that would just receive him and says,
[44:47] "This is the Christ. Who do you say I
[44:49] am? You are the Christ of the living
[44:52] God." Every there was people that began
[44:54] to receive him and who he was.
[44:59] And because of
[45:00] that, because those that rejected him,
[45:03] they didn't see him in his resurrection.
[45:06] He opened himself to
[45:08] all. But whenever he came
[45:12] again, all didn't see him. It was only
[45:16] those that desired to know who he was in
[45:18] the simplicity.
[45:21] That's where we're at. Do you want to
[45:23] know him in his
[45:24] simplicity? And whenever you grasp him,
[45:27] whenever you receive him, then you'll be
[45:30] that group in direction
[45:34] there. He he those people that received
[45:37] him were the only ones that saw him.
[45:40] Mary Magdalene, John, Peter, all of
[45:43] them because just as the Bible says, we
[45:47] receive him and we see glory unto glory
[45:50] unto glory unto glory. So when you see
[45:53] him and you know him, then he'll take
[45:56] you to another step. He'll take you into
[45:58] another step of glory. He'll take you
[46:01] another step of his goodness.
[46:04] And here the same thing whenever he was
[46:07] about to
[46:08] leave there he he he says I I got to go
[46:12] but another one cometh there's another
[46:14] coming thank you Jesus so he's there but
[46:18] another one cometh and they no don't go
[46:20] he says if I don't go the comforter
[46:22] doesn't come
[46:24] so then they had to receive
[46:27] him so that they could receive the
[46:30] comforter
[46:31] it was what from glory from knowing him
[46:34] to knowing him to knowing him to knowing
[46:37] him. We don't know him by flesh. Brother
[46:39] Brandham says that Peter, he didn't know
[46:42] Christ in the
[46:43] flesh. That's why Paul, he was able to
[46:46] receive him because Paul didn't receive
[46:49] him in flesh. He received him by
[46:51] revelation. Amen. We can we can come to
[46:54] church all our lives, but if we don't
[46:57] receive that revelation, if we don't
[47:00] desire for to really know who he is,
[47:03] then we're just never going to receive
[47:04] what we need in church services, in the
[47:08] tapes that we listen to, in the worship
[47:11] that we we have. We will never receive
[47:14] him until we say, "Lord, give me that
[47:17] revelation. Lord, let me know you. let
[47:20] me see who you truly are. Then that's
[47:23] when God will will truly show himself to
[47:26] us.
[47:28] Let us stand to our
[47:30] feet. I I I truly believe that um that's
[47:33] each and every one of our desires is to
[47:37] give God all the glory and say, "Lord, I
[47:40] want more of you." Amen. If the
[47:42] musicians would like to come up and let
[47:44] us bow our
[47:48] heads. Heavenly
[47:51] Father, Lord, you're worthy of all the
[47:54] honor and the glory. Lord, you're
[47:57] just so good to make yourself known to
[48:01] us people that are unworthy. Father, we
[48:04] we are nobody special. We're not a
[48:06] special lineage. We we we not righteous
[48:10] by our own works, but Father, Lord,
[48:13] somehow by your grace, you've allowed us
[48:16] to come into your presence, Lord.
[48:19] Allowed us to be called your bride.
[48:21] Allowed us to be called
[48:23] saved. Father, I just ask that you bring
[48:27] yourself down to each and every person
[48:29] here. that if they they're struggling to
[48:32] get closer to you or if they need more
[48:34] of you, Father, that Lord, you may be
[48:37] readily available for them. Father God,
[48:40] give to them what they need. Reveal
[48:43] yourself in the healing. Reveal yourself
[48:45] in in taking care of the situation. And
[48:48] moreover, Father, reveal yourself in the
[48:50] word through them, Father, so that they
[48:53] may know
[48:54] you. Lord, we thank you for everything
[48:56] that you have done. We ask all this in
[48:59] the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[49:02] And amen. Amen. God bless you. God be
[49:04] with you.
