[0:00] isaiah chapter 55 verses 1 and 2 i sent
[0:04] such a tremendous presence that i want
[0:06] to just
[0:07] get straight into the word isaiah
[0:10] chapter 55
[0:11] verses 1 and 2 ho everyone that
[0:13] thirsteth come ye to the waters
[0:16] and he that hath no money come ye buy
[0:19] and eat yea come buy wine and milk
[0:22] without money and without price
[0:25] wherefore do you spend money for that
[0:27] which is not bread
[0:28] and your labor for that which satisfyeth
[0:30] not
[0:31] hearken diligently unto me and eat ye
[0:34] that which is good
[0:35] and let your soul delight itself in
[0:38] fatness as you can tell from the slide
[0:41] that's there my
[0:42] title tonight is not being fed
[0:46] and it's a question and i've used the
[0:48] emphasis of three question marks just to
[0:50] give that emphasis not being fed and
[0:53] ponder that that it would even be
[0:55] you would even express that in your
[0:56] heart or be in a situation where you're
[0:58] not being fed the question is
[0:59] are you not being fed god bless you you
[1:02] can have your seats
[1:04] as we pose that question not being fed
[1:07] we read from isaiah 55
[1:08] and pick up um in amos chapter eight
[1:12] uh we had been looking at this last uh
[1:14] wednesday night as well
[1:16] even our communion service was on in
[1:18] this theme of hunger
[1:19] in eating and feasting and it says
[1:22] behold the days come
[1:23] saith the lord that i will send a famine
[1:25] in the land
[1:26] not a famine of bread nor a thirst for
[1:29] water but of hearing
[1:30] the words of the lord and we know that
[1:34] brother branham takes this scripture and
[1:35] applies it to the time that we're living
[1:37] in
[1:38] such that we see that this is end-time
[1:40] prophecy being brought to pass
[1:42] and verse 12 even goes on to speak how
[1:45] that people
[1:45] go here and go there searching seeking
[1:47] trying to find
[1:48] the word of the lord trying to satisfy
[1:50] this hunger in a time of a famine and
[1:53] they'll not be able to find it
[1:54] but brother brahma says it's about that
[1:56] time that god raises up something
[1:59] so when there was a great famine in
[2:01] laodicea and the world
[2:02] had reached its climax in terms of
[2:05] darkness a complete
[2:06] blackout of the age as brother branham
[2:09] identified it even god himself
[2:11] identified it as a complete blackout
[2:13] and we know that christ was put out of
[2:15] the church there's your spiritual famine
[2:17] but in the midst of that famine god
[2:20] raises up something
[2:21] thank god there's a revelations 3 20.
[2:24] behold i stand at the door not giving us
[2:26] an opportunity to sup so that's
[2:28] those are the things that are in view as
[2:30] we minister on this and as we ponder
[2:32] this
[2:32] but he says i will send a famine in the
[2:35] land not a famine of bread nor thirst
[2:37] for water
[2:38] but of hearing the words of the lord so
[2:40] this is a famine
[2:42] not for natural things not for abundance
[2:44] not for physical pleasure not for
[2:46] entertainment
[2:47] not for structure or government not
[2:49] bread not even a famine of miracles but
[2:50] a famine of hearing the word of the lord
[2:53] and a famine of hearing the word creates
[2:56] a weakness of faith
[2:58] without faith it is impossible to please
[3:00] god so we know that we must have faith
[3:02] to please him
[3:03] but without the hearing of the word we
[3:05] cannot have
[3:06] faith and if there's a famine for
[3:09] hearing the word and that creates a
[3:10] weakness of faith
[3:12] that impacts our spiritual health if our
[3:14] faith is not strong then our spiritual
[3:16] health
[3:17] is not going to be strong and and i feel
[3:20] very overwhelmed just to touch on this
[3:21] for a moment
[3:22] and i'm just not sure how much you might
[3:25] pull me in this direction but i feel
[3:27] directed just to
[3:28] make reference to this at the outset as
[3:30] i
[3:31] i've been pondering maybe a different
[3:32] thought for sunday
[3:35] let's not confuse and we want to always
[3:37] be kind of careful of this to not
[3:38] confuse the trying
[3:40] of our faith for a crisis of faith
[3:43] in other words we know that our faith is
[3:45] going to be tried that there's just no
[3:47] way that our
[3:48] faith is not going to be tested um
[3:50] proven or sought out
[3:52] and we know that the test is for our
[3:54] benefit
[3:55] uh we know in the world that when we're
[3:56] given a test uh
[3:58] in in school the teachers are testing us
[4:00] to find out where we are
[4:02] but when it comes to god he knows right
[4:03] where we are but the test is for us to
[4:06] know where we are
[4:07] and god many times has given you a test
[4:09] just so you can realize that you've got
[4:11] this
[4:12] he's wanting you to go through a test so
[4:14] you realize you have what it takes that
[4:15] he's given you everything that you have
[4:17] need of
[4:18] so there is a trying of our faith but
[4:20] then also there is a weakness or
[4:22] crisis of faith and we need to be very
[4:25] careful
[4:25] that we're not confusing what is a trine
[4:28] of your faith that means you have faith
[4:30] it's just being tried it's being
[4:32] perfected versus a time when maybe your
[4:34] faith is weak or it's a crisis of faith
[4:36] and you fail to
[4:37] feed on the word of god and put yourself
[4:39] in a position to benefit from the word
[4:42] because it's very easy to get
[4:43] discouraged when we're fighting
[4:46] and if you're fighting when faith is
[4:47] being tested the battle is the lord's
[4:50] but if you're fighting because of a
[4:51] weakness of faith or crisis of faith you
[4:53] just need to get in the right channel
[4:54] and get where god wants you to be and
[4:58] this is uh this is how i just feel to
[5:00] expound upon a little bit more
[5:01] conflict often is the result or we could
[5:04] just say this way conflict is a result
[5:06] of
[5:06] opposing forces meeting and engaging so
[5:09] if you sent some sort of fighting or
[5:11] some sort of struggle some sort of
[5:12] testing
[5:13] uh you're going through something that
[5:14] means opposing forces are engaging
[5:17] and and in meeting and this is what i
[5:19] want you to think about maybe just
[5:21] ponder for
[5:22] for some time going forward the word is
[5:25] often the aggressor
[5:28] now think about this you're fighting
[5:29] you're going through something all this
[5:31] is a fight this is a struggle
[5:32] this is this is really hot and heavy and
[5:34] we think of ourselves as kind of huddled
[5:36] in the corner
[5:37] and we're just being beat up and we're
[5:38] being bombarded because we sense that
[5:40] there's a fight but i want you to think
[5:41] about a little bit differently
[5:43] sometimes that fight is because the word
[5:45] is the aggressor
[5:47] that the fight is taking place not
[5:48] because the devil has launched a
[5:50] surprise attack but rather the devil has
[5:51] been exposed and he's been uncovered
[5:53] and that's why there's a fight you say
[5:56] well the devil's attacking me maybe the
[5:57] devil's fighting back
[6:02] think about it or the devil's attacking
[6:04] me i'm being bombarded i'm really going
[6:06] through it and we feel some sort
[6:07] we feel defenseless we feel vulnerable
[6:09] but what but i want you to think about a
[6:11] little bit different aspect
[6:13] that many times the word is the
[6:15] aggressor
[6:16] and the there's a battle and there's a
[6:18] fight that's taking place because of the
[6:20] advancement of the word
[6:22] and the word has exposed satan in one of
[6:24] his hideouts there was never a battle
[6:25] because he possessed that land
[6:27] there was never a conflict there was
[6:28] never a fight because he just settled
[6:30] down and got comfortable
[6:31] but now the word is advancing and the
[6:34] word pulls up on the devil
[6:35] and rips off his cover and says time's
[6:37] up buddy get out of here
[6:39] and starts driving him out and so he
[6:41] kind of gets defensive and he gets a
[6:43] he gets angry he gets riled up and the
[6:45] fight isn't because your faith is weak
[6:47] but because your faith is strong and
[6:49] getting stronger
[6:50] and advancing into areas that the devil
[6:52] thought he could just relax and chill
[6:54] out for a while
[6:56] and they're maxing like michael jackson
[6:57] and all of a sudden the word comes along
[6:59] and says hold up wait a minute ain't
[7:00] gonna happen
[7:03] and so i know that we give the credit
[7:05] some time to the devil he's bombarding
[7:07] me he's attacking me just working me out
[7:08] working me over no i want you to turn it
[7:10] completely around and say the word must
[7:12] really be giving the devil a hard time
[7:15] because he
[7:16] is angry
[7:19] angry with the capital g he is angry
[7:22] he is mad he's riled up and and that's
[7:25] not
[7:25] because you're weak and because the
[7:27] devil's after you but it's because the
[7:28] word is advancing
[7:30] and you think about when brother branham
[7:32] preached i think it's in the greatest
[7:33] battle ever thought
[7:34] he says how did grant take richmond
[7:37] just as he come to it so it's an
[7:40] advancement of the uh
[7:42] of the of the word of god it's an
[7:43] advancement of your faith
[7:45] the the battle that's raging in your
[7:47] mind the things that we go through as
[7:48] believers
[7:49] don't make it look like there's weakness
[7:51] and you're vulnerable and you and
[7:52] you're upsetting this and it's because
[7:54] you failed here and you felt there no
[7:56] you could just believe that this is the
[7:58] advancement of the word
[7:59] that's driving the devil out and so if
[8:02] you hold that in your minds
[8:04] uh because you're going to come to a
[8:05] place here in a little bit and i don't
[8:06] want you to get confused thinking oh a
[8:08] crisis of faith and
[8:10] and i'm not doing this and i'm not doing
[8:11] that but it's the word wanting to have
[8:13] preeminence
[8:15] so in isaiah chapter 55 it says ho
[8:18] everyone that thirsteth
[8:19] come ye to the waters and he that hath
[8:22] no money come ye buy
[8:24] and eat yea
[8:27] come buy wine and milk without money and
[8:30] without price i just want to
[8:31] break these two verses down tonight a
[8:34] little bit in isaiah 55
[8:36] so it says every one that thirsteth when
[8:39] it uses this word thirst it's an intense
[8:41] desire it's a vehement
[8:42] active restless hunger for something
[8:46] so it's not just everyone that i would
[8:48] like a drink it's everyone that
[8:50] thirsteth it's an intense desire a
[8:52] vehement desire
[8:53] it is something that's even a restless
[8:55] desire for something
[8:57] that this cannot be just easily
[8:58] satisfied this is very deep this is very
[9:00] strong
[9:01] and so it addresses this person who's
[9:03] thirsty or this person
[9:05] it's addressing this person two ways one
[9:08] that is thirsty and it says
[9:09] he that hath no money so it is care the
[9:12] person is characterized as one that's
[9:14] thirsty
[9:15] and he that hath no money he that hath
[9:17] no silver the word that's used there
[9:18] would be silver
[9:19] or or talents or or some sort of token
[9:22] he that hath no silver
[9:23] and therefore there must be a
[9:25] consciousness of a lacking
[9:27] cannot be allowed to see in condition
[9:29] where i'm rich increased with goods i
[9:30] have needed nothing i have everything
[9:32] that i need
[9:32] and not just say would you like a really
[9:34] nice drink no this is somebody who
[9:36] knows that they they're thirsty knows
[9:38] that they can't buy this drink
[9:40] they know that they don't have what's
[9:41] necessary to provide for themselves
[9:43] everyone that is thirsty with this
[9:45] vehement desire and he that have no
[9:47] money
[9:48] is conscious of their lacking or their
[9:50] neediness
[9:51] this is the person that's being
[9:52] addressed he that is thirsty he that
[9:54] hath no money and then it says come ye
[9:56] who the thirsty and poor to the waters
[10:00] this is the first invitation ye that are
[10:02] thirsty come to the waters
[10:04] it's an invitation to abundance that's
[10:06] going to satisfy this deep longing in
[10:08] this person
[10:09] you that have this vehement desire this
[10:11] deep longing this
[10:12] this restlessness in you there's
[10:14] something that's active a thirst that is
[10:15] active
[10:16] come to the waters and it's not just
[10:18] water but water so it speaks of
[10:19] abundance
[10:20] that's going to satisfy and quench that
[10:22] intense desire
[10:24] and it's saying that come to the waters
[10:26] and then it says come by
[10:28] wine and milk and the waters the wine
[10:31] and the milk
[10:32] these are things that are necessary for
[10:34] spiritual life
[10:36] just as there might be a reference to
[10:38] how that
[10:39] uh water and bread and the wine and the
[10:41] milk are
[10:42] necessary for natural life and it's
[10:44] referring to these elements that one
[10:45] would
[10:46] rely upon to give strength to the
[10:47] natural body the word god
[10:50] speaking here is referring to water wine
[10:52] and milk as things that are necessary
[10:54] for spiritual life and and i want to
[10:57] just point this out it's referring to
[10:58] the word of god
[11:00] when he says come to the waters come by
[11:02] wine and milk he's referring to the word
[11:04] of god
[11:04] which maintains which gives you your
[11:06] spiritual life which maintains and
[11:08] nourishes your spiritual life
[11:10] it's what strengthens you and gives you
[11:12] and gives you power the word of god
[11:15] in ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 speaking
[11:18] about jesus christ that he might
[11:20] sanctify and cleanse the church
[11:21] with the washing of water by the word
[11:24] so it says come to the waters it's
[11:26] referring to the word
[11:28] the word is the water the word is what
[11:29] washes speaking of even wine it says
[11:32] come by
[11:33] wine we know that wine it's that power
[11:35] of spiritual revelation of the word that
[11:37] stimulates the believer
[11:39] we've heard this in the teaching of the
[11:41] seals that the wine
[11:42] type is referencing to the power of
[11:45] revelation
[11:46] spiritual revelation that stimulates the
[11:48] believer
[11:49] what gives what causes the believer who
[11:51] slumped down and sad
[11:53] revelation it causes him to be
[11:54] stimulated to pick him up
[11:56] the bible says in psalms 19 verse 8 the
[11:58] statutes of the lord are right rejoicing
[12:01] the heart
[12:02] it speaks of a stimulation what
[12:03] stimulates us the word of god does
[12:06] the statutes of the lord are right
[12:08] they're correct they stimulate they
[12:09] rejoice the heart
[12:11] so the water is the word the wine is the
[12:14] word in first peter chapter 2 verse 2 as
[12:16] newborn babes
[12:17] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[12:20] ye may grow thereby
[12:22] so the water is the word the wine is a
[12:24] reference to the word the milk is a
[12:26] reference to the word which
[12:27] nourishes our souls and causes us to
[12:29] grow up into his
[12:30] image so the the bible is speaking he
[12:33] that is thirsty he that has no money
[12:35] come to the waters come by wine and milk
[12:38] he's speaking about the word of god
[12:41] and brother branham we used this
[12:43] statement last time in the smyrnan age
[12:44] no true believer
[12:46] is any stronger and spiritually healthy
[12:49] and alive
[12:50] than his knowledge of and adherence to
[12:52] the pure word of god
[12:54] now all these elements are necessary for
[12:56] this sentence to hold up
[12:58] as as correct and it's referring to
[13:01] the true believer no true believer
[13:05] is going to be any more healthy than
[13:07] their knowledge of and adherence to
[13:09] their understanding of and their
[13:11] obedience to the
[13:12] pure word of god so your spiritual
[13:15] health your spiritual vitality your
[13:17] aliveness
[13:18] and how you're thriving is based upon as
[13:21] a true believer it's based upon your
[13:23] understanding knowledge and revelation
[13:25] of the word of god and your subsequent
[13:27] humility submitting
[13:29] and obedience to that word of god
[13:31] therefore what we desire
[13:33] is we desire to hear the word of god
[13:35] that we may know the word of god
[13:37] so that we can be alive in the word of
[13:38] god our desire is to hear the word not
[13:41] fables not stories not opinions
[13:43] but i want to hear the word as a true
[13:45] believer i must be hearing
[13:47] the pure word of god understanding the
[13:49] pure word of god
[13:50] then submitting myself to the pure word
[13:53] of god in order to be strong
[13:54] healthy and alive because i'm not going
[13:56] to be any more healthy alive
[13:58] and strong than my knowledge of an
[14:01] adherence to
[14:02] the pure word of god so everyone that's
[14:05] thirsty
[14:06] he that has no money come to the waters
[14:07] come to the word
[14:09] to receive your nourishment come to the
[14:11] wine come to the mill come by these
[14:13] things
[14:13] and partake of them that you may be
[14:15] strong
[14:16] now it this the even the way this is
[14:18] structured the the
[14:20] uh the wording of it is very unique it
[14:23] says you know he that hath no money
[14:26] come by and it's so it's
[14:29] somewhat of a paradox how could we buy
[14:31] something if we
[14:32] have no money understanding that this is
[14:36] god now calling someone to a spiritual
[14:38] benefit
[14:38] how is it that we could transact or
[14:41] afford the word
[14:43] what is it i'm going to bring to give in
[14:46] exchange for the word and say well
[14:48] you've made this word available here's
[14:50] this water here's this wine here's this
[14:52] milk which rep
[14:53] which is referring to the word of god
[14:55] and i brought my purse with me i brought
[14:57] my wallet i brought my debit card
[14:58] how is it we're going to transact for
[15:00] the word of god
[15:02] there's no consideration that could be
[15:04] given for what is being offered
[15:08] do you disagree should we should we make
[15:11] this open forum and you could
[15:12] you could share with me what you think
[15:14] is valuable enough to exchange for the
[15:16] word of god
[15:17] there's no consideration that could true
[15:19] properly be given
[15:20] that would be a just transaction for
[15:22] what god is offering
[15:24] because the word is priceless you have
[15:28] nothing that you can give for it
[15:30] there's nothing you could offer there's
[15:31] nothing you could pay there's nothing
[15:33] that you could give in value
[15:34] that is equatable to the value of the
[15:37] word that's being offered
[15:38] but he says come and buy and it says
[15:41] everyone that's thirsty he that has no
[15:43] money come to the waters and it says
[15:44] come ye by the word by there means
[15:46] purchase grain or purchase corn
[15:49] and that's why it says eat so it's not
[15:51] just referring to
[15:52] water milk and wine this is not just a
[15:55] liquid diet and
[15:56] this isn't your justification well i
[15:57] found a juice cleanse in the bible
[15:59] uh no this is uh this is a reference to
[16:02] even buying grain or buying corn
[16:05] so come and buy
[16:08] come and come and transact saying
[16:11] but yet it can be had without money and
[16:13] without price
[16:16] it can be had without silver without
[16:18] talents without without something for
[16:20] you to give i want you to ponder this
[16:23] because the price
[16:24] is not in what is being given these are
[16:27] this is something that's being freely
[16:28] offered it's being freely granted say
[16:30] come take what i'm offering to you
[16:32] freely that's what the scripture
[16:34] is wanting us to see is that these
[16:35] things are being freely given this is
[16:37] the word of god
[16:38] that's being offered and the price is
[16:40] not in what is given
[16:42] but in what is being forsaken
[16:45] i want you just to consider that for a
[16:47] moment it's not in what is being given
[16:50] but it's in what is being forsaken
[16:56] it's in whatever's keeping you from it
[17:04] it's not bothering me at all it's
[17:07] sounding a little funny but
[17:09] it's not bothering me at all
[17:13] well i'm only going to have one hand to
[17:14] bless god's people
[17:16] if i start walking down the aisles
[17:22] let's see if this works well something
[17:24] somewhere's going wrong
[17:27] i ain't bothered by it
[17:32] as we're taking this scripture come and
[17:35] buy
[17:36] wine and milk without money and without
[17:40] price
[17:42] but there is a i want you just to ponder
[17:44] this there is a cost
[17:46] in order for there to be values the
[17:48] scripture is just referring come and
[17:49] take these things
[17:50] and have these things that says come and
[17:52] buy the buying
[17:53] is not what you're offering but it's
[17:55] what you're leaving that's keeping you
[17:57] from it
[18:00] there's something that you're going to
[18:01] forsake you're going to forsake sin to
[18:03] come to christ you're going to forsake
[18:04] the world to come to christ
[18:05] there's something that you're going to
[18:06] leave off there's something that you're
[18:08] going to give up the worldly attitudes
[18:10] and the worldly wants
[18:11] so there is something that is given up
[18:13] but it's not something that's offered in
[18:15] exchange
[18:16] as if it has enough value to marry you
[18:18] receiving it
[18:21] so there's a price not in what is given
[18:22] but what is forsaken or there's a price
[18:25] in leaving aside the very thing that was
[18:27] keeping you from the word of god
[18:29] that's a cost or that's a price that you
[18:31] should be glad to pay
[18:34] but then also is it the scriptures says
[18:37] this come you that are thirsty
[18:39] but the thirsty who have no money coming
[18:41] by
[18:42] so as i've been pondering this statement
[18:44] and to me it does seem to be somewhat of
[18:46] a paradox
[18:47] it struck me that the cost is actually
[18:50] your desire
[18:52] it says come ye that are hungry you that
[18:54] are thirsty you that have a vehement
[18:56] desire
[18:56] the price is actually your hunger in
[18:59] other words
[19:00] that's the currency that's necessary in
[19:02] order to get the word
[19:04] you've got to have something if you
[19:06] don't want it
[19:07] you're not going to get it if you if if
[19:09] you're not going to seek for it you're
[19:10] not going to find it if you don't say
[19:12] god give it to me then he's not going to
[19:14] give it to you so there's got to be
[19:16] something in your heart that drives you
[19:19] to seek it
[19:20] and so he says you that are hungry even
[19:22] though you have no money come and buy it
[19:24] and it's your hunger
[19:26] that's the currency you use to transact
[19:28] for the word of god
[19:30] your hunger your desire is a currency
[19:33] your hunger is it's it's as if it's
[19:36] purchasing power
[19:38] to get you what you want the bible says
[19:41] blessed are they which do hunger and
[19:43] thirst after righteousness
[19:45] for they shall be filled what is the
[19:48] thing that they had in order to be
[19:50] filled
[19:50] hungering and thirsting that's all that
[19:53] they had they didn't have anything else
[19:54] i'm really hungry i'm really thirsty
[19:56] and i have a gift card here i have a
[19:58] wallet here i've got cash i've got my
[19:59] dad's credit card
[20:00] he had none of those things the only
[20:02] thing that they have
[20:04] that merit to them being filled was the
[20:06] fact that they were hungry and thirsty
[20:08] and that put them in the channel to get
[20:09] what they had need of
[20:12] the cost is your desire the price is
[20:14] your hunger that's the currency that you
[20:16] use
[20:17] to get this word that's being offered
[20:20] that's why he says in in revelation
[20:24] chapter 3 come by of me
[20:26] gold tried in the fire it says in
[20:28] proverbs 23 23 buy the truth and sell it
[20:31] not
[20:33] also wisdom by wisdom also by
[20:35] instruction also by understanding get
[20:37] wisdom and all that getting get
[20:39] understanding
[20:39] the bible is putting this price on on
[20:42] truth and
[20:43] understanding and wisdom if you're going
[20:45] to get something by the truth
[20:47] and don't sell it because there's
[20:48] nothing as valuable as the truth
[20:51] it's not necessarily suggesting that you
[20:53] can buy the truth because it's easier to
[20:55] sell a lie than to give the truth away
[20:59] but it's saying that this is something
[21:00] that you should desire get it at any
[21:02] cost
[21:03] but don't let go of it for anything get
[21:06] the truth at any cost but don't let go
[21:08] of it for anything
[21:09] because nothing is as valuable as the
[21:11] word of god
[21:13] it says in job chapter 23 verse 12
[21:15] neither have i gone back
[21:16] from the commandment of his lips i have
[21:19] esteemed the words of his mouth i have
[21:21] esteemed i have valued
[21:23] i have revered i have looked to the word
[21:26] and judged it to be worth
[21:27] i have esteemed the words of his mouth
[21:29] more than my necessary food
[21:32] in other words his word is greater than
[21:34] my law
[21:36] the law of the flesh that requires
[21:38] nutrients requires sleep requires
[21:39] vitamins requires meat
[21:41] requires food his word is more than my
[21:43] law it's more than the needs of my flesh
[21:45] it's more than the wants of my flesh
[21:47] it's more precious to me than meat and
[21:49] bread i have esteemed
[21:50] his word more necessary than the law
[21:53] that works within me that says you
[21:55] better eat you better sleep in order to
[21:56] be healthy
[22:00] that's a uh that's a carnivore diet uh
[22:03] scripture right there i've esteemed the
[22:04] word of god
[22:06] more necessary than the meat more
[22:09] necessary than food it speaks
[22:11] it's more precious than meat is what
[22:12] he's speaking of
[22:14] in psalms 119 17 72 the law of thy mouth
[22:18] is better he's esteemed the words of his
[22:21] mouth he says the law of thy mouth is
[22:22] better unto me
[22:24] than thousands of gold and silver
[22:27] this is this is a value system which is
[22:30] completely changing the way humans think
[22:32] the way humans act as we've been using
[22:34] john chapter 6
[22:35] and how physical hunger had hijacked
[22:37] their thinking
[22:38] to not perceive the value of the one
[22:41] that was standing before them
[22:42] and would have been more it would have
[22:44] been satisfied with more loaves and
[22:45] fishes
[22:47] and would have been completely content
[22:49] to live out their days on free food
[22:51] and not recognize the value of the one
[22:53] that was standing before him
[22:55] that had they recognized the messiah
[22:57] they said you know what i don't care if
[22:58] i don't eat another day in my life
[23:00] if my sins be forgiven me then smite me
[23:03] smite me lord as much as you want strike
[23:05] me with poverty
[23:06] strike me with famine whatever you want
[23:07] to do to me if my sins be forgiven me
[23:10] and i've been liberated by the word of
[23:11] god
[23:12] into his blessed righteousness then come
[23:14] what may it doesn't matter i'm free
[23:16] but they didn't value the word that was
[23:18] standing before him
[23:21] the law of thy mouth is better unto me
[23:23] than thousands of gold and silver
[23:25] psalms 19 10 more to be desired are they
[23:29] than gold yay than much fine gold
[23:33] that's this is the word it's talking
[23:35] about the judgments of the lord his
[23:38] thoughts
[23:39] they're to be desired more than gold you
[23:41] mean you'd want it more than cash you'd
[23:43] want it more than
[23:44] currency you'd want it more than a
[23:46] technology and
[23:47] in all in wealth and riches and a nice
[23:50] car and nice amenities and all these
[23:51] things yes it should be desired more
[23:53] than gold
[23:54] more than fine gold and everything that
[23:55] gold could purchase and then also it
[23:57] speaks to the needs of the body
[23:59] sweeter also than honey and the
[24:01] honeycomb
[24:03] this is how the word ought to be
[24:05] perceived by the true believer
[24:08] this is lifting up the value of the word
[24:10] come ye that are thirsty
[24:12] you that are poor and get acquire and
[24:15] have the word of god and this word ought
[24:17] to be more precious to you
[24:19] than meat it ought to be more precious
[24:21] to you and sweeter to you than the honey
[24:23] and the honeycomb
[24:25] desired more than gold
[24:28] but brother branham says and i know i'm
[24:30] using a lot of callbacks to these other
[24:33] statements we've already read a few
[24:35] times he says and to see right now in
[24:36] this evil day that we live
[24:37] in when unbelievers and scientists
[24:41] and so forth so that captures everybody
[24:43] that would be against the word
[24:45] unbelievers scientists and so forth
[24:47] sometimes we run into so forth sometimes
[24:49] it's unbelievers sometimes it's
[24:50] scientists
[24:51] but unbelievers scientists and so forth
[24:53] are trying to
[24:55] this is what they're trying to do cut
[24:56] away the very value
[24:58] of the word we could look at it in this
[25:01] sense that maybe
[25:02] there it might not be an attack against
[25:05] the word but it's merely a distraction
[25:07] from it
[25:08] in other words they've somehow devalued
[25:10] it and if it can lose its value it loses
[25:12] its impact
[25:14] if you could cut away at the value of
[25:16] the word then it won't be as
[25:18] it won't do for you what it ought to do
[25:20] because you won't be perceiving it the
[25:22] correct way you won't be saying hey this
[25:23] should be desired more than gold this is
[25:25] sweeter than the honey and the honeycomb
[25:26] i have esteemed it more
[25:28] than my necessary food if you don't
[25:30] recognize the true value of it and what
[25:32] it can do
[25:33] you won't use it to its fullest extent
[25:35] so many times
[25:36] satan is merely satisfied in you not
[25:38] perceiving the correct value of the word
[25:40] even though you've accepted it
[25:44] think about it he knows maybe it's too
[25:45] late to get you to deny it
[25:47] so if he can just get you to deny how
[25:49] powerful it is
[25:51] what did he teach us if he could just
[25:52] get you to doubt your weapon
[25:55] no it's not not deny that you have it
[25:57] not deny it
[25:58] completely but just doubt that it's
[26:00] greater
[26:02] to get you to say well i know i've got
[26:04] it i believe this i believe that but
[26:06] have some sort of doubt that makes it
[26:07] subject to the circumstance
[26:09] and and what scientists and unbelievers
[26:12] and these modern theo
[26:13] theologians and and the different ways
[26:15] that brother man talks about the
[26:16] modernists in the church
[26:17] are trying to cut away the value and the
[26:21] worth
[26:21] and the power of the word of god
[26:24] the value of the word it's worth its
[26:26] benefit it's power it's strength
[26:29] just cut away at it just diminish it a
[26:31] little bit just water it down
[26:32] just marginalize it make something seem
[26:34] greater than it make something even
[26:36] build up something that's a substitute
[26:38] for it
[26:38] trying to cut away the value of the word
[26:42] who can measure its value
[26:46] how how could we how could we measure
[26:49] the value of the word
[26:52] the word that formed the heavens
[26:55] the word that framed the earth the word
[26:58] that fashioned
[26:59] man the word that stopped the mouths of
[27:02] lions the word that stopped the wind the
[27:04] word that stopped the sun the word that
[27:06] stilled the seas
[27:07] how could you measure the value of a
[27:09] word that created everything that has
[27:12] value
[27:13] how could you accumulate it how could
[27:15] you quantify it how could you qualify
[27:17] how could you put a price tag on the
[27:19] word what's the price
[27:20] of the word that's why the bible says
[27:23] without money and without price there's
[27:24] no price tag
[27:26] if you go to search for the word i mean
[27:28] you can't put you can't put a param well
[27:30] i want to be
[27:31] between a hundred and a thousand if i
[27:32] could that's my sweet spot that's my
[27:34] budget i just want to find it
[27:35] no there's no value on it it's priceless
[27:39] how are we going to use economics to
[27:41] figure out what the value of the word is
[27:45] let's let's use the law of supply and
[27:47] demand
[27:49] to figure out just how what what a fair
[27:51] price would be for the word you can't do
[27:53] it it's limitless supply
[27:55] and almost no demand
[28:00] you can't use economic theory you can't
[28:02] use um
[28:03] the the metrics of fairness and the
[28:05] things that we might try to come up with
[28:07] to find value
[28:08] and what are scientists and unbelievers
[28:10] and so forth trying to do
[28:11] cut away the value of the word
[28:16] so it asks this in verse 2 why wherefore
[28:18] do you
[28:19] spend money for that which is not bread
[28:23] why are you spending money
[28:26] your silver those things that you commit
[28:29] for that which is not bread so speaking
[28:31] of that which
[28:32] feeds that it's beneficial something
[28:34] that feeds you
[28:35] and why do you spend your labor exercise
[28:38] your labor
[28:39] in things that don't satisfy you
[28:42] ponder this very very sincerely tonight
[28:45] why do you spend money wherefore do you
[28:47] spend money for that which is not bread
[28:49] and your labor for that which satisfy if
[28:51] not
[28:51] here's different ways that it's
[28:52] translated and the meaning that's behind
[28:55] these words that are used why would you
[28:57] be so zealously attached to something
[28:59] from which your souls derive neither
[29:01] comfort nor nourishment
[29:04] why would you zealously pursue something
[29:06] and be an ardent supporter of something
[29:08] and get behind something and put your
[29:10] time into something
[29:11] and be attached to something that your
[29:13] soul does not derive
[29:15] neither comfort nor nourishment from
[29:18] what is it that you are benefiting from
[29:21] if you get behind something and pursue
[29:23] something
[29:24] if it doesn't nourish your soul that's
[29:26] the question that's being asked
[29:29] why is there continual sacrifice
[29:31] spending and giving but no lasting
[29:33] profit
[29:33] or satisfaction come on somebody at
[29:37] least think about your neighbor
[29:41] why are there continual sacrifices
[29:44] spending and giving
[29:45] but no lasting profit or satisfaction
[29:48] it's asking the question why give time
[29:50] and opportunity and strength
[29:52] to something that does not nourish and
[29:53] not only does it not nourish but it's
[29:55] actually harmful and destructive
[29:56] destructive why do you spend why do you
[30:00] give why do you support why do you
[30:02] do things for something that's not only
[30:04] no benefit to you but it actually
[30:06] defiles it cankers it riles up your
[30:08] spirit
[30:08] instead of refreshing and feeding that's
[30:11] the question that's being asked in
[30:12] isaiah 55 2.
[30:14] why do you labor for support get behind
[30:16] spend
[30:18] encourage be attached to pursue labor
[30:21] for
[30:21] spend your money on something that
[30:24] doesn't benefit you
[30:27] that's a good question isn't it wouldn't
[30:29] we all like to ask the neighbors in
[30:30] apartment 23
[30:32] all right why do you do that because we
[30:34] couldn't be talking about
[30:36] us in proverbs chapter 20 verse 17
[30:40] it says bread of deceit is sweet to a
[30:42] man
[30:44] this was a very profound statement i'm
[30:46] not going to unpack it
[30:48] in the least bit tonight but i want to
[30:50] just use a quick principle from it
[30:52] bread of deceit to sweet to a man but
[30:54] afterwards his mouth shall be filled
[30:56] with gravel
[31:00] think about it there's a
[31:03] it may appear pleasant
[31:07] it may appear even acceptable it may
[31:09] even seem to be right it may be
[31:10] something that in the moment you enjoy
[31:12] and it might be something that you feel
[31:14] oh well this is good this is acceptable
[31:15] this is why i'm doing this this is why
[31:17] i'm pursuing it in the context of why do
[31:19] you spend money for that which is not
[31:20] bread and
[31:21] labor for that would satisfy not when
[31:23] you're deceived you might think
[31:25] initially
[31:26] that there's some benefit in it but
[31:28] ultimately your mouth is just full of
[31:30] gravel
[31:32] it causes an empty belly and pain to
[31:34] your mouth
[31:36] that's what the scripture is painting
[31:37] the picture of it's a bread of deceit
[31:40] deceit that
[31:41] there's so it's in the mechanics of what
[31:43] you're eating it may appear to be good
[31:44] it may appear to be satisfying
[31:46] but it's not satisfying in proverbs
[31:49] chapter 13 verse 23
[31:50] much food is in the tillage of the poor
[31:54] the poor who labor the poor who work
[31:56] there's food that comes from laboring
[31:58] but there is that but there is that is
[32:01] destroyed
[32:02] for want of judgment
[32:06] where there's a lack of discernment
[32:09] where there's a lack of recognition of
[32:11] need where there's a lack of where the
[32:12] bread of deceit deceives someone
[32:14] thinking this is precious this is good
[32:15] this is beneficial and they only end up
[32:17] with a mouthful of gravel
[32:19] where one realizes they're needy and
[32:21] they're poor and that they have need of
[32:22] something
[32:23] they will labor and they will seek to
[32:25] have food and so there's a lot of food
[32:27] to someone
[32:28] who labors knowing that they're needy
[32:30] but there's a lack of discernment
[32:33] that causes people to starve
[32:36] there's no reason to starve except you
[32:38] lack discernment
[32:42] don't take this personal i know how
[32:45] sometimes we might feel like there's
[32:46] just a spotlight on us and say
[32:48] why is brother aaron picking on me
[32:49] tonight this is they're not taking the
[32:52] spirit
[32:52] we're just talking about truth this is
[32:55] truth
[32:56] there is no excuse for not being fed
[32:58] except a lack of discernment
[33:02] it says in proverbs chapter 13 verse 25
[33:05] the righteous edith to satisfying
[33:08] of his soul but the belly of the wicked
[33:10] shall want
[33:12] translation in the bible we're reading
[33:14] together is a family
[33:16] reading the bible in a year it says the
[33:17] righteous eat to live and the wicked
[33:19] lived to eat
[33:22] and what is it something's not right
[33:25] something's out of balance it's that
[33:28] bread of deceit that seems sweet and
[33:30] we're gonna get and we're gonna have and
[33:32] how there's no labor for it is there's
[33:34] much food in the
[33:35] laboring of the poor but that that is
[33:37] where there's no judgment there's a one
[33:39] of judgment that is destroyed it says
[33:40] the righteous will eat to the satisfying
[33:43] of his soul
[33:43] the righteous will eat and be satisfied
[33:47] but the wicked eat and still want
[33:51] never quite satisfies it never nourishes
[33:53] it's just it's something that's just
[33:54] done in the moment it's something just
[33:56] to placate it's nothing
[33:57] just to check the box but the righteous
[33:59] know that they've got to have this to
[34:01] live
[34:01] whereas the wicked think well we're just
[34:03] enjoying an abundance and we're just
[34:05] doing this because
[34:06] we can and we're just going to have this
[34:08] and to have that and just playing games
[34:09] but the righteous knows it's life or
[34:11] death so they eat to live
[34:13] where's the wicked just they live to eat
[34:15] because it's all in the abundance and
[34:17] the show of it
[34:19] the bible is asking the question
[34:23] you're not being fed that's what isaiah
[34:26] 55 2 is saying
[34:28] why are you not being fed
[34:32] why is it that you are starving
[34:36] i'm even asking this as believers to us
[34:38] in the time that we're living in today
[34:40] how could we be starving
[34:47] even why is it i hunger not in the sense
[34:50] that i'm getting more
[34:51] i have something and i want more but why
[34:53] am i dissatisfied
[34:54] why do you spend money for that which is
[34:56] not bread why do you labor for things
[34:57] that don't satisfy
[34:58] those are the questions that are being
[35:00] asked now
[35:02] if to this point you feel as if i've
[35:03] been given a pretty good beating to
[35:05] somebody you don't know i'm
[35:06] who i'm talking about but you just
[35:07] figure somebody's getting raped over the
[35:09] coals
[35:10] the devil's going ah he's been exposed
[35:12] in someone's life but not mine
[35:15] this is where i wanted to hit home with
[35:18] this with this as the the background
[35:20] with this is kind of our backdrop
[35:23] these things that we've built up to this
[35:24] point
[35:26] it's very easy as individuals and even
[35:28] as a church to develop bad habits which
[35:30] would perpetuate
[35:32] the cycles of revival and famine
[35:36] you've got you please just think very
[35:39] personally about this
[35:41] and and recognize uh there are certain
[35:45] modalities or modes or methods or ways
[35:47] that we do things and
[35:49] in cycles that we go through and these
[35:52] things that can take place where we're
[35:53] just all kind of in the mode and it's
[35:55] almost as if we've all
[35:56] just acknowledged that i got on a roller
[35:58] coaster
[35:59] and this is we're just on a roller
[36:01] coaster we're going down up
[36:03] and down and that's what church becomes
[36:07] it's just a roller coaster
[36:08] and we've all just kind of strapped in
[36:10] and one day it's all going to be over
[36:11] and one day we're going to meet the lord
[36:13] in the air and one day is going to be no
[36:14] more no
[36:15] because we've just accepted this as this
[36:18] is the way things work
[36:20] but that's not how god works there's
[36:23] ways that we can conduct ourselves it's
[36:25] very easy to
[36:26] develop bad habits that perpetuate the
[36:28] cycle of revival and famine revival and
[36:30] famine and we just kind of get in this
[36:32] mode where we're kind of nurtured and
[36:34] we've evolved to the place where i
[36:35] better get what i can now because i
[36:37] could be on a famine i better get what i
[36:39] can now
[36:39] because there's going to be a famine and
[36:41] it's a cycle that we must break
[36:44] the bride in this hour is a
[36:48] cycle breaker she is the ultimate cycle
[36:50] breaker
[36:51] so whatever cycles there were whatever
[36:53] fashions there are whatever traditions
[36:54] there are
[36:55] whatever systems there are that have
[36:57] withheld kept the bride back from
[36:59] defeating death
[37:00] this bride you have been called up and
[37:02] ordained in this hour
[37:04] to break every cycle
[37:08] you've got to break them all and there's
[37:10] this cycle of revival and famine and oh
[37:12] we're going to have special meetings
[37:13] whoa and then just go right back down
[37:15] again
[37:16] and what you kind of you're looking
[37:17] forward to the next invitation so
[37:18] brother aaron
[37:19] when's brother cadre coming back you
[37:20] know you have any plans on having him
[37:23] back and
[37:24] you're slipping notes to the the brother
[37:26] maybe you could invite this brother did
[37:27] you know so-and-so is in town and maybe
[37:29] you should do this why
[37:30] because you're hungry for revival
[37:33] so you're looking for the next meeting
[37:35] to bring it
[37:40] and it's a bad habit that's encouraging
[37:45] and allowing the system to subsist
[37:48] and it gets justified and gets
[37:49] entrenched and it's all revival
[37:51] famine revival famine
[37:55] brother branham says in the message
[37:56] supernaturally says
[37:58] the sermon entitled supernatural i
[38:00] believe the message is supernatural
[38:02] not just the one that was supernatural
[38:04] i've been asked before and the question
[38:06] is
[38:06] well what year did brother branham say
[38:08] that and my answer has always been
[38:10] in the year in which he was a prophet
[38:21] it seems to work he says and that's
[38:24] what's the matter with the people today
[38:26] they got campground cramps
[38:31] they go to revival and have a great time
[38:32] the first thing you know a little after
[38:34] that before another revival could come
[38:35] along they're back in the world again
[38:38] now i'm not gonna i'm not making the
[38:40] point that this is what we're doing as
[38:41] message believers that we have revivals
[38:43] and we go in the world but i want you to
[38:45] recognize
[38:46] that he's identifying a pattern where
[38:49] you get campground
[38:50] cramps you feed on the word of god you
[38:52] go to revival you have a great time
[38:54] and then after that you go back into a
[38:56] grind or a certain way and it's a system
[38:59] where things just really aren't that
[39:01] great and they're just like a snowball
[39:02] rolling downhill and ah this isn't very
[39:04] good this isn't good but then there's a
[39:05] revival that comes and you kind of get
[39:07] picked up you get lifted up and okay
[39:09] maybe we can make this work okay
[39:10] maybe maybe this is gonna this is good
[39:12] but then it just goes through this cycle
[39:14] and he calls it campground cramps
[39:16] and he's referring to diet he's
[39:19] referring to how a person eats
[39:20] he says in the message where pentecost
[39:22] failed now you're finding yourself with
[39:23] cramps
[39:25] he says not enough manna backsliding
[39:29] from one meeting to another
[39:31] now as a believer we're backslid as long
[39:33] as we're not going forward
[39:35] so it's not that we have to go back it's
[39:36] just we're not going forward so he says
[39:37] you're finding yourself with cramps
[39:39] something wrong with your diet he says
[39:41] not enough manna
[39:44] in the message hidden life with christ
[39:45] there's people sitting here listening to
[39:47] me tonight that loves the lord
[39:49] that's living out there in those courts
[39:51] he's talking about those different
[39:52] courts and coming to the
[39:53] holiest of holies and that hidden life
[39:57] but there's a place that you can live he
[39:58] says speaking with tongues and shouting
[40:00] having a good time eating the manna
[40:03] because there's a manner that's
[40:04] associated with those he says and the
[40:06] missed
[40:06] mill cramps just in a few days
[40:10] campground cramps he says not enough
[40:11] mana cramps now
[40:13] missed mill cramps in a few days
[40:17] here's the revival here's a here's the
[40:19] word and here's a rejoicing having a
[40:21] good time feeding on the word of god
[40:23] but then somehow you missed mills and in
[40:25] a few days he says you don't know what
[40:26] it's all about i just can't hold on
[40:28] brother
[40:28] adam i don't know what's the matter what
[40:31] is he describing
[40:32] the cycle of revival and famine
[40:36] and you're all and you're not feeding in
[40:38] the famine so whenever the preacher
[40:40] comes along you just
[40:41] gorge and gorging what happens you eat
[40:43] too much and you get cramps
[40:45] something's wrong with that lifestyle
[40:48] something's wrong with that way of
[40:49] thinking
[40:50] i pray to god that the only time that
[40:52] it's not
[40:53] the only time that you're eating i pray
[40:55] that it's not this that you're only
[40:56] eating when you come to church
[41:00] i pray that that's not what's happening
[41:02] is you're just wow you're not feeding on
[41:04] the word of god through the week you're
[41:05] not praying reading your bible you're
[41:06] not listening to the message you're not
[41:07] in the word and then you come here
[41:09] and you're going to try to get something
[41:10] out of the word it's going to be like
[41:11] trying to drink out of a fire hydrant
[41:17] it says in another place called hidden a
[41:18] hidden life he says and i think a lot of
[41:20] people
[41:21] has had a lot of campground cramps
[41:23] anyhow
[41:24] that when they go and eat of the lord on
[41:26] the campground
[41:27] and before another revival can come
[41:29] along they're all back and notice he
[41:31] says all back and twisted up in some
[41:33] kind of cult or something else
[41:35] what's the matter brother you've never
[41:36] walked in somewhere else
[41:39] so it's only happening when the meetings
[41:41] are going it's only happening when the
[41:42] revival is taking place
[41:44] there's a mindset he's identifying at
[41:46] that time a pentecostal mindset
[41:49] where they were literally living from
[41:50] meeting to meeting and they were living
[41:52] to eat instead of eating to live
[41:55] and they weren't getting what they
[41:56] needed from the word of god
[41:58] to sustain them and keep a constant
[42:00] trajectory they were going revival and
[42:02] famine revival and famine revival and
[42:04] famine
[42:05] so they weren't even getting what they
[42:07] needed in their meetings because their
[42:08] judgment was wrong
[42:11] they would eat and just get krampus they
[42:12] wouldn't get enough man they wouldn't
[42:13] get the right things they're speaking
[42:15] with tongues having a good
[42:16] time praising and rejoicing he says the
[42:17] revival comes along
[42:19] but then they have campground cramps and
[42:21] after a while they're back in the same
[42:22] kind as something else
[42:24] some kind of occult some kind of way of
[42:25] thinking some kind of mode
[42:27] some kind of twisted pattern and they
[42:29] haven't found
[42:30] that right channel
[42:33] brother abraham says it this way some
[42:35] people just eat enough mana to make them
[42:36] write good and hungry for some more
[42:39] but one revival to another you have to
[42:41] go out and get renewed again
[42:44] he's identifying the cycle
[42:47] of revival and famine and it's very easy
[42:51] for us as individuals and then
[42:52] collectively
[42:53] even as a church to get into this mode
[42:56] where we're just
[42:57] existing from meeting to meeting
[43:01] i'm sure some of you have experienced
[43:04] this
[43:04] there's this uh mindset that i was
[43:07] familiar with for myself and i knew
[43:09] others that had it
[43:10] that you would go to easter camp in
[43:12] louisiana and i thank god for brother
[43:14] tim pruitt brother danny williams
[43:16] who uh and and there was brother cabra
[43:18] who even maybe helped with the first one
[43:19] but
[43:20] brother tim pruitt has kept those
[43:22] meetings going for decades
[43:25] had been a tremendous blessing and you'd
[43:26] have this you would know that you could
[43:29] meet the lord there
[43:30] you could have an experience and god
[43:32] would move and there'd be a tremendous
[43:33] atmosphere that would be created
[43:35] and so god could move in your heart at a
[43:37] meeting and then you'd kind of go in the
[43:38] glow of that and the energy of that
[43:40] and then if you fell away a little bit
[43:42] or got cold or you backslid you'd have
[43:44] this thought in your mind well
[43:46] next easter come on am i right
[43:50] you'd have in your mind well next march
[43:52] next april
[43:53] and so you'd kind of just think well
[43:54] i've got the next eight months off if
[43:56] you did really good or maybe the next 11
[43:57] months off
[43:58] and you just have in your mind well i'm
[44:00] just gonna wait for the next one
[44:01] and it's almost as if that's wired into
[44:04] our daily thinking about church
[44:05] that well whenever we have meetings
[44:07] everything's going to be great and the
[44:08] word's going to be good and everything's
[44:10] going to be in order everybody's going
[44:10] to be excited and everything's going to
[44:12] come forth and you live from revival to
[44:14] revival
[44:15] if you're doing that you're living way
[44:16] below your privileges
[44:18] living way way way way way you're a
[44:20] minor now you've gotten underneath
[44:22] and started digging and you're finding
[44:24] rock bottom because the skies are full
[44:26] of the real thing
[44:27] and you're tunneling to nonsense because
[44:30] we ought to not live in that cycle
[44:33] of revival and death because god has
[44:35] made available to you
[44:36] the entire word of god for you to feed
[44:38] on 24 7
[44:40] 365.
[44:48] people just eat enough to get by from
[44:50] one revival to another
[44:53] brotherhood says this in the message
[44:54] thirst it comes from a larger statement
[44:56] that i wanted to use and
[44:58] and i'd kind of taken it out but then i
[44:59] just felt just later this afternoon i
[45:02] have to at least use this part here
[45:05] if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of
[45:07] water or food you will die
[45:10] he's making the point he says maybe
[45:12] maybe you're not caught with these
[45:13] thirst and you lust after this and you
[45:15] lust after that and you want to do
[45:16] things and the way it says
[45:17] maybe maybe you're not caught up in that
[45:20] end he says but let me identify and
[45:22] point out of
[45:22] another dangerous place to be and he's
[45:25] saying the danger of neglecting a thirst
[45:29] so maybe not you're not out there you
[45:30] know snorting cocaine and maybe you're
[45:32] not out there you know
[45:33] chasing you're the black tar heroin
[45:36] dealer
[45:37] you know somewhere and trying to do
[45:38] drugs and do this or you're not robbing
[45:40] and stealing and cheating maybe you're
[45:41] not caught up in those thirsts and those
[45:43] addictions
[45:44] but he's saying maybe you're neglecting
[45:45] the thirst he's saying just as bad
[45:48] if you neglect to satisfy a thirst to
[45:50] water food you will die if you neglect
[45:52] that thirst in you for god you will
[45:53] spiritually die
[45:55] he says you call for revivals you wait
[45:57] for your church to have a revival he
[45:58] says well that ain't
[46:00] the revival for you the revival ought to
[46:03] begin
[46:04] right in you when you begin to thirst
[46:07] for god
[46:10] it's not waiting for a preacher to bring
[46:11] it a pastor to bring it a service to
[46:13] bring it or some time of the year to
[46:15] bring it
[46:15] he says that ain't the revival for you i
[46:17] love how he makes it personal
[46:19] right here in 1965 he says that's not
[46:21] the bride's revival
[46:23] the bride's revival is not waiting for
[46:25] something to happen her revival's here
[46:27] and she's gonna have it when she gets
[46:29] hungry for it
[46:31] i'm not sitting around twiddling my
[46:32] thumbs will or just it will work till
[46:34] jesus comes
[46:35] and just waiting for something to happen
[46:37] as if a revival is gonna come one day
[46:39] when a 900-foot jesus splits the sky no
[46:42] your revival is here right now
[46:46] the revival ought to begin right in you
[46:48] when you begin to thirst
[46:49] for god that's when it starts
[46:53] and he's identifying a mentality in this
[46:55] message supernatural when presence
[46:57] where pentecost failed and hidden life
[46:59] with christ a hidden life and these
[47:00] other places
[47:01] he's identifying this mindset to where
[47:03] you're just surviving
[47:06] not in revival and and it's remarkable
[47:10] it's as if people are dying and they get
[47:13] resuscitated
[47:15] on the surgery table of a special
[47:17] meeting
[47:21] and they've come back from flatlining
[47:24] finally have a special meeting like
[47:27] isn't this great and that's wonderful
[47:29] everything's great
[47:31] hallelujah praise the lord this is great
[47:33] they're just surviving
[47:35] they still got the iv cooked up near
[47:37] they
[47:38] they're not they're still in the surgery
[47:39] room they're not living
[47:42] and they're just conscious enough in
[47:43] this grade and if there's one
[47:46] just in time for another meeting
[47:50] you haven't been called to survive
[47:54] is that what we want to do in laodicea
[47:56] survive
[47:58] listen the bride is not going to have a
[47:59] bumper sticker on the back of her car in
[48:01] the millennium saying i
[48:02] survived laodicea it's going to be i
[48:04] absolutely destroyed it
[48:08] i so defeated it i'm not even identified
[48:11] with it i'm not even considered
[48:13] a laodicean bride i'm a bright age bride
[48:16] that's how
[48:17] far away i have put laodicea from me i'm
[48:19] not beaten down by it i'm not touched by
[48:22] it i'm not living it
[48:23] i don't smell like it i don't look like
[48:25] it i don't feed on it i'm not
[48:27] it i am then my bright age feasting with
[48:29] my king
[48:32] not just surviving but i'm thriving in a
[48:34] bright age
[48:36] not just getting by but i'm in revival
[48:39] because what is the bride's revival
[48:42] is it just eking out we're all fighting
[48:45] over the same thing
[48:46] you let me have some you let me have
[48:48] some it's my turn let me have a drink
[48:49] please
[48:50] please it's my turn i'm dying over here
[48:55] brother braham says in recognizing your
[48:57] day in its message he says god created
[48:59] me a revival
[49:01] i don't send one created me one let me
[49:05] be the revival
[49:07] let each one of us be the revival the
[49:09] revival
[49:10] in me when does the revival begin when
[49:13] you begin to thirst for god
[49:15] so he says make me lord to hunger
[49:18] make me to thirst create in me lord that
[49:22] what is needed in me
[49:24] create it in me what i need created in
[49:28] me
[49:29] i'm not even having to go to somebody
[49:30] else and say well you got what i need no
[49:31] you
[49:32] create what i need in me you
[49:35] give me what i need make me hunger make
[49:37] me thirst
[49:38] because i want to be the revival create
[49:41] in me a revival
[49:42] the revival in me not a revival in a
[49:45] church building not a revival in special
[49:46] meetings not a revival of the camp not a
[49:48] revival on a particular weekend but lord
[49:50] let
[49:50] me be the revival how is that going to
[49:53] happen by the word
[49:54] coming to you and having promised and as
[49:56] i hunger and thirst
[49:58] for the word the revival begins when i
[50:00] begin to thirst for god
[50:02] and i say i want it more than i want
[50:04] food i want it more than i just want a
[50:06] good church service
[50:07] i want it more than i just want some
[50:08] program i want the word
[50:11] that's your revival
[50:15] not being fed
[50:18] really not being fed
[50:23] there's no reason to go without food
[50:25] saints
[50:27] there's no reason to go four days
[50:29] without it there's no reason to go to a
[50:30] week there's no reason to go a decade
[50:32] there's no reason to go
[50:33] a day without manna because despite the
[50:37] spiritual drought god has provided food
[50:41] despite all of man's attempts and
[50:43] satan's attempts and despite
[50:45] the the the thousands of years of church
[50:47] age history and christ being bound by
[50:49] creeds and dogmas
[50:50] god has made a way
[50:55] yes there's a famine but god's done
[50:58] something
[50:59] he's raised something up
[51:02] it says in psalms 105 verses 16 to 17
[51:06] as we were looking at john chapter 6
[51:09] jesus is talking about bread
[51:13] and he said you just seek me because you
[51:15] want the miracles
[51:17] you seek me because you saw miracles and
[51:18] in seeing the miracles experiencing the
[51:20] miracles it fed your body
[51:22] and you only seek me because your belly
[51:24] is full not because you have spiritual
[51:26] discernment
[51:27] that the word is standing before you so
[51:30] really
[51:31] they had mouths full of gravel
[51:35] they hadn't eaten to satisfy their soul
[51:38] but their belly is still wanted why
[51:41] because it was just natural bread
[51:47] and they were the ones that said well in
[51:50] the exodus it was
[51:52] you know when we were in the exodus our
[51:54] fathers ate man in the wilderness and
[51:55] moses provided
[51:56] manna and they go to the exodus to
[51:59] identify how that god made provision
[52:02] and in psalms 105 it's telling that
[52:05] story of how god brought the children of
[52:06] israel out of egypt
[52:08] but as it's describing how they were in
[52:10] egypt and they were in a famine
[52:13] he said moreover he god called for a
[52:16] famine upon the land
[52:18] he break the whole staff of bread so
[52:20] here's israel
[52:22] or in the land of egypt and in the whole
[52:24] region round about
[52:26] there had been a famine come upon canaan
[52:28] and palestine
[52:29] even abraha abraham's family and the
[52:31] children of israel
[52:32] there had been a famine come upon the
[52:34] whole region there was a famine in egypt
[52:36] a famine in palestine a
[52:38] famine in the middle east perhaps maybe
[52:39] the whole world was suffering a famine
[52:41] but notice what it says in verse 17
[52:43] he sent a man before them
[52:46] even joseph so god
[52:50] caused a famine we read that there's
[52:52] going to be a famine in the land that i
[52:54] will send to famine not for bread and
[52:56] not for water
[52:57] not for human food or food that feeds
[52:59] the soul or the body
[53:01] but rather a famine of hearing the word
[53:03] of god i the lord will cause a famine
[53:06] and here it says i brought a famine a
[53:08] famine came over the whole world
[53:09] but i've sent a man before you
[53:14] i've sent someone before you even joseph
[53:17] and you can begin to identify how that
[53:20] in laodicea as it's descending into
[53:22] chaos
[53:22] and descending into darkness god had
[53:24] sent a man even a prophet
[53:26] who is going to bring a spiritual
[53:28] revelation that would feed the bride
[53:30] spiritual manna to give her strength for
[53:33] a rapture
[53:35] he sent a man before them even joseph
[53:39] and it was joseph who in interpreting
[53:41] the dreams understood
[53:43] that there would be seven years of great
[53:44] fatness there'd be seven years of great
[53:46] harvest and then there'd be seven years
[53:47] of famine
[53:49] and he by in spiritual insight he sent a
[53:52] man before them
[53:53] using this phrase he sent a man before
[53:55] them even joseph
[53:56] is just to bring him to view that how
[53:58] despite a famine coming
[54:00] he had given one with spiritual insight
[54:03] who could provide in a time of famine
[54:06] and joseph had the wisdom to say store
[54:08] up build up greatness build up silos
[54:10] store up grain
[54:11] during the time of plenty and during the
[54:13] time of fatness so that whenever the
[54:14] famine comes you can have grain to live
[54:16] by and you can make it through the
[54:17] famine
[54:19] and notice how joseph this this plan is
[54:22] orchestrated and unfolds in genesis
[54:23] chapter 47.
[54:25] and i'm using this and i could have
[54:27] perked you up a little bit by saying in
[54:28] closing
[54:30] uh because i'm sure i'm wanting to use
[54:32] this to kind of as my final
[54:34] to bring it to a final use of scripture
[54:35] here he says in there the
[54:38] bible says in genesis chapter 47 verses
[54:40] 13 to 18
[54:41] and there was no bread in all the land
[54:45] but he had sent a man before him no
[54:48] bread and all the land for the famine
[54:49] was very sore so that the land of egypt
[54:51] and all the land of canaan
[54:52] fainted by reason of the famine
[54:56] now notice what begins to happen in
[55:00] joseph gathered up all the money that
[55:02] was found in the land of egypt
[55:04] and in the land of canaan for the corn
[55:07] which they bought
[55:09] this is this is what's actually
[55:10] happening there's a famine
[55:13] but now joseph has put together a pr a
[55:16] plan
[55:18] to where because of this famine all the
[55:20] people in egypt and all the land of
[55:21] canaan are taking their money to buy
[55:23] corn
[55:24] of joseph so that all the money that was
[55:26] found in the land of egypt and canaan
[55:29] was accrued and taken by joseph and
[55:31] joseph brought the money
[55:33] into pharaoh's house and when the money
[55:35] fell in the land of egypt in the land of
[55:37] canaan all the egyptians came to joseph
[55:39] and said give us bread
[55:40] for why should we die in thy presence
[55:42] for the money faileth
[55:44] and joseph said give your cattle and
[55:47] i'll give you for your cattle if money
[55:49] fell
[55:49] and they brought their cattle unto
[55:51] joseph and joseph gave them bread in
[55:53] exchange for horses and for the flocks
[55:55] and for the cattle the herds and for the
[55:57] asses
[55:57] and he fed them with the bread for all
[55:59] their cattle for that year
[56:02] do you are you recognizing what's
[56:04] happening literally
[56:06] there's a famine in all the land but
[56:08] joseph whose prophetic insight
[56:10] has stored up grain but not everybody
[56:12] else did it nobody else had a reserve
[56:14] so when they begin to get into famine
[56:16] and they needed grain they took all
[56:17] their money and they used it to buy
[56:19] corn then once that year was over they
[56:22] don't have any more money left and he
[56:23] says well just give me your cattle
[56:25] so they took their next asset that they
[56:27] had they said all right here's all of
[56:29] our cattle so now pharah has all their
[56:30] money and has all their cattle but the
[56:32] drought is still continuing
[56:34] and when that year was ended they came
[56:36] unto him the second year and said unto
[56:37] him
[56:38] we will not hide it from my lord
[56:41] how that our money is spent
[56:44] my lord also hath herds of cattle and
[56:47] notice this beautiful phrase
[56:49] there is not ought left in the sight of
[56:51] my lord but our bodies
[56:53] and our lands
[56:57] a plan had been orchestrated and
[56:59] unfolded to where
[57:00] because of a famine there was money that
[57:04] got rid of
[57:05] there was cattle that got rid of and it
[57:06] got to the place to where now the people
[57:08] had nothing else that they could use to
[57:10] barter
[57:11] nothing else they could use in exchange
[57:13] for what that was being offered
[57:14] except themselves
[57:18] i can give you money i'll just pay this
[57:19] and i'll just give you that and i'll
[57:21] just support with this and i'll get that
[57:22] they finally came to a place
[57:24] where they weren't just playing church
[57:26] anymore they just weren't supporting
[57:27] something
[57:28] it wasn't just games as long as they had
[57:30] something they could give
[57:31] and we're exchanging our cattle we're
[57:32] exchanging our money we're exchanging
[57:34] our time
[57:34] it got to a place of desperation
[57:36] twilight says we've got nothing left but
[57:38] our bodies and our lands
[57:40] and that's exactly what joseph had
[57:42] orchestrated for pharaoh
[57:44] and let me say this if joseph had done
[57:46] that for pharaoh
[57:47] has not jesus christ orchestrate the
[57:49] same thing in our hearts
[57:51] where ultimately what he desires is that
[57:53] our hunger brings us to a place
[57:55] of full surrender and i've got nothing
[57:57] else to give you but me lord
[58:00] that's what he wants to do with the
[58:02] hunger he placed in your heart not just
[58:04] to sympathize with the message
[58:05] not just to support it with ties and
[58:07] offerings not just to attend church
[58:09] not just to say that you believe it not
[58:11] just to be associated with it
[58:12] not just to play church listen he wants
[58:14] the hunger to bring you to a place
[58:16] where one day god i've got nothing else
[58:19] i'm
[58:19] desperate for this word here i am lord
[58:24] this is where our hunger should bring us
[58:27] to give all
[58:29] a place where we realize this is life or
[58:31] death
[58:33] this this we're not playing around
[58:37] could you imagine being in some compound
[58:41] in
[58:41] palestine someone travels through and
[58:45] they've got a
[58:46] whole bunch of bags full of grain
[58:49] and someone says well i'm not being fed
[58:52] not being fed
[58:54] haven't you heard there's granaries for
[59:00] haven't you heard there's a place you
[59:01] can go
[59:04] did you not listen this message is not
[59:06] bound by creeds and dogmas
[59:07] this message is not bound by man's
[59:09] interpretation this message is not the
[59:11] message of man this is not a message
[59:13] that can be manipulated and controlled
[59:15] the true word of god is yours it's your
[59:17] right it's your privilege
[59:19] you can ask for it you can have it not
[59:21] being fed
[59:22] are you kidding me this word is yours
[59:24] eat it
[59:27] there's no excuse for not being fed
[59:33] so he says hearken isaiah 55 2 hearken
[59:37] hearken diligently unto me
[59:42] and eat that which is good and let your
[59:45] soul delight itself in fatness
[59:47] hearken unto me the word hearken unto me
[59:51] that which is essential
[59:54] and you will be fed abundantly
[59:58] not just enough to make it to the next
[59:59] revival
[1:00:02] but come to my word and eat that which
[1:00:04] is good and let your soul
[1:00:05] delight itself in fatness
[1:00:09] brother braham talked about the a fish
[1:00:11] being in the water
[1:00:14] and being afraid to run out
[1:00:18] or a mouse in the granaries
[1:00:21] of egypt
[1:00:25] you know gathering around just a little
[1:00:26] bit of grain and say well we better be
[1:00:28] careful we don't want to run out
[1:00:32] don't live below your privileges we
[1:00:35] shouldn't live below our privileges
[1:00:38] but our hunger should be leaving us
[1:00:40] leading us to a place we recognize this
[1:00:42] is life or death
[1:00:44] i must i must be fed
[1:00:48] i must be feeding on the word of god i
[1:00:49] must be receiving substance
[1:00:52] i guess one question we should all ask
[1:00:54] ourselves
[1:00:55] is what i'm eating on going to lead me
[1:00:57] to a body change
[1:01:00] or my spiritual habit is going to lead
[1:01:02] me to a body change
[1:01:04] because that's the promise of this age
[1:01:06] now if we were in another age we could
[1:01:08] say well you know what kind of casket do
[1:01:10] you want
[1:01:11] how do you want your funeral and what i
[1:01:14] feed it on is it going to bring me to a
[1:01:15] grave
[1:01:17] but that's not the hour we're living in
[1:01:20] and that's why i would say this we often
[1:01:23] experience such disappointment
[1:01:27] because it's that pinch the pining of a
[1:01:30] hunger for more
[1:01:31] that's why you just aren't satisfied
[1:01:33] with playing church that's why you're
[1:01:34] not just satisfied with politics and
[1:01:36] personality
[1:01:37] that's why there's something in he says
[1:01:38] i know i've got to be in fellowship with
[1:01:40] the word
[1:01:41] that's why you knew streaming wasn't
[1:01:43] enough
[1:01:45] because you knew that's not how god
[1:01:46] ordained their body change to happen
[1:01:48] is by viewing something on a screen i
[1:01:51] liken it could you stream your own
[1:01:53] wedding
[1:01:55] i mean this is an invisible union that's
[1:01:58] taking place service after service
[1:02:01] there's something powerful that's
[1:02:02] happening that you want to be present
[1:02:04] for there's a dynamic that's present
[1:02:06] and a body of christ being a part of it
[1:02:07] you can't stream it to make it
[1:02:10] it's wonderful how the it can supplement
[1:02:12] and it can work in in places when we
[1:02:14] don't have the opportunity
[1:02:15] but listen you have to really challenge
[1:02:17] yourself
[1:02:18] on am i in a place where i'm feeding on
[1:02:20] the word of god
[1:02:21] in my inner channel where i'm getting
[1:02:23] the word of god that i need
[1:02:25] to meet the mark of this age
[1:02:32] brother branham makes the statement and
[1:02:34] christ is a mystery god revealed he says
[1:02:36] why do you hunger church
[1:02:40] because i know you're hungry not just
[1:02:42] because it's 8 30 and you didn't
[1:02:44] you ate at five o'clock
[1:02:47] i know you're hungry i know you're
[1:02:50] hungry because i'm
[1:02:52] i'm the one that's standing before you
[1:02:54] on wednesdays and sundays
[1:02:57] and i feel your pinch all through the
[1:03:00] week
[1:03:02] you're hungry for the word we're we're
[1:03:05] not hungry
[1:03:06] for another cycle we're not hungry for
[1:03:10] another a method or system we live from
[1:03:13] revival to revival
[1:03:14] we're hungry for a body change we're
[1:03:17] hungry for a rapture
[1:03:19] we're hungry for the word of god we're
[1:03:21] hungry for christ nothing else will
[1:03:23] satisfy
[1:03:23] he says why are you hunger why do you
[1:03:25] thirst this is so beautiful
[1:03:27] it's the father trying to reveal this
[1:03:29] hidden secret to you
[1:03:31] the repetition of history the reciting
[1:03:33] of things past said
[1:03:35] uh even just the the laying out of
[1:03:37] quotes those things aren't going to
[1:03:38] satisfy you what's going to satisfy you
[1:03:40] is the revelation of the hidden secret
[1:03:44] that pining that pinching that desire
[1:03:46] that hunger that you've had
[1:03:47] you think well brother aaron i've had
[1:03:49] this hunger this
[1:03:50] appetite from the moment i came to the
[1:03:52] message in the 70s and it's never left
[1:03:54] me i was always restless
[1:03:56] what was it god trying to reveal to you
[1:03:58] not that god sent a prophet
[1:04:00] not to say what the tapes say not to
[1:04:02] just revel in some history
[1:04:03] but to receive the father's secret
[1:04:06] that's what you're hungry for is the
[1:04:08] father's secret he says but you let so
[1:04:10] many things get it out of you
[1:04:12] you let so many things keep you from it
[1:04:16] he says without money without price what
[1:04:19] value have you set between you and the
[1:04:21] hidden secret
[1:04:23] you let your job you let your wife you
[1:04:25] let your husband you let your children
[1:04:28] you let the cares of this world you let
[1:04:29] some pastor you let somebody else get
[1:04:32] that out of you what get out the pining
[1:04:34] the desire
[1:04:35] the longing for the father's hidden
[1:04:38] secret
[1:04:39] when you know let's say i i would just
[1:04:43] i know in your heart right now maybe you
[1:04:46] have a desire for family you have a
[1:04:47] desire for a lost loved one you have a
[1:04:49] desire for somebody you have a desire in
[1:04:51] your own hearts think about this
[1:04:53] when you know that way down in your
[1:04:55] heart you are thirsty
[1:04:57] hungry it's god trying to reveal it to
[1:05:00] you
[1:05:03] that's what he wants to do he wants to
[1:05:04] reveal his hidden secret to you nothing
[1:05:06] else is going to satisfy
[1:05:08] plain church won't do it plain holy
[1:05:10] won't do it doing this and doing that
[1:05:12] nothing else will do it
[1:05:13] nothing will satisfy unless the father
[1:05:15] has revealed himself to you
[1:05:19] why are you a hunger why do you thirst i
[1:05:22] believe there's
[1:05:23] some people that are hungry
[1:05:26] i believe there's people that are not
[1:05:27] being fed
[1:05:29] and they don't know where to go they
[1:05:32] don't know what to do
[1:05:35] and maybe just crack the door open to
[1:05:38] the things i've been studying on
[1:05:41] we have been called to be stewards of
[1:05:43] the mysteries
[1:05:45] not the protectors of it
[1:05:48] not the ones that are going to hide it
[1:05:50] not the ones that are going to cover it
[1:05:52] and say well you know it's not for
[1:05:54] everyone
[1:05:58] we're not the ones that we're not
[1:05:59] building walls
[1:06:02] we're not protecting it when it made
[1:06:04] your stewards of the mysteries it makes
[1:06:06] you a distributor of it
[1:06:08] that means you have a responsibility to
[1:06:10] find the person who's hungry for it
[1:06:13] and i would want that to be at the heart
[1:06:15] of every single one of you that's here
[1:06:16] tonight that
[1:06:18] that god is gathering together around
[1:06:20] the fresh word of the lord
[1:06:21] that there would be something inside of
[1:06:23] you that takes ownership of the fact
[1:06:25] that you have found the more that you
[1:06:27] found a provender you found a grain
[1:06:29] you found a word where the carcass is
[1:06:31] there the eagles would be gathered
[1:06:33] and he recognized that i have a
[1:06:34] stewardship not to
[1:06:36] to gather this and to myself and to
[1:06:39] horde over it
[1:06:40] and to be protect over but made a
[1:06:42] steward of the mystery
[1:06:43] and i have a responsibility to find the
[1:06:46] hungry
[1:06:48] and to invite them come to the table
[1:06:50] come to the place where the word is
[1:06:52] being
[1:06:52] presented come where you could find
[1:06:54] satisfaction for your soul
[1:06:56] i say that maybe we could have a heart's
[1:06:57] cry tonight lord
[1:06:59] i am hungry lord i want to be fed lord i
[1:07:02] don't want to repeat
[1:07:03] cycles lord i don't it's easy just to
[1:07:05] get in the cycle
[1:07:06] that perpetuates revival and famine
[1:07:09] lord break me out of that cycle but also
[1:07:12] god i pray
[1:07:13] that you would send the hungry
[1:07:16] lord send the hungry send those that are
[1:07:19] thirsty
[1:07:20] send the poor send the needy send the
[1:07:22] broken
[1:07:23] send the hurting because we found a word
[1:07:26] that can heal
[1:07:29] found something that satisfies
[1:07:33] oh god let it not be said
[1:07:36] from my lips that i'm not being fed
[1:07:43] may it not be i'll take responsibility i
[1:07:46] believe that i
[1:07:47] i can as a minister i can through
[1:07:50] shortcomings and through a lack of
[1:07:52] sanctification and a lack of humbling
[1:07:55] myself
[1:07:56] and forgetting of what that i'm a sheep
[1:07:59] you could go down a path to where yes
[1:08:01] you're not
[1:08:03] preaching what the people need to feed
[1:08:05] on
[1:08:08] so i'm not making it all your
[1:08:09] responsibility i make it mine
[1:08:11] oh god let it never be said that i'm not
[1:08:13] feeding the lambs
[1:08:15] oh god let it not be said that i'm not
[1:08:17] feeding the sheep that's a
[1:08:18] responsibility
[1:08:20] that a man god has but may none of us
[1:08:23] ever say we're not being fed
[1:08:27] if you're not get somewhere where you
[1:08:29] can
[1:08:31] do it the hour's way too late
[1:08:34] way too late we're not playing church we
[1:08:37] never were
[1:08:40] but we it was never a game we were just
[1:08:43] playing one
[1:08:44] it's life for death saints not being fed

[1:14:38] spiritual feast that this world knows
[1:14:40] nothing of
[1:14:41] it's time to break cycles of wandering
[1:14:43] around
[1:14:44] up and down and in and out like a gypsy

[1:15:26] more
[1:15:29] gracious heavenly father but i'm feeling
[1:15:32] so
[1:15:32] pulled to continue just to
[1:15:36] admonish the people to break the cycle
[1:15:40] i'm speaking to individuals not making
[1:15:43] observations about churches or
[1:15:44] situations but lord i'm talking about
[1:15:46] how
[1:15:47] we as individuals can live within a
[1:15:49] mindset
[1:15:51] to where we're living from meeting to
[1:15:53] meeting revival to revival lord it would
[1:15:55] even be wrong to live from sunday to
[1:15:56] wednesday
[1:15:59] just dragging ourselves to church to get
[1:16:01] a little bit to survive
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:05] lord may these eagles recognize
[1:16:08] today that the chain has been cut
[1:16:12] they're no longer tethered to that pen
[1:16:15] they're no longer tethered to that stake
[1:16:18] and lord though they may have wandered
[1:16:20] in circles for years
[1:16:22] in circles for years lord they may have
[1:16:24] pecked around in that barnyard for
[1:16:26] decades and decades
[1:16:28] may they recognize the call of the
[1:16:30] mother eagle
[1:16:31] that has told them they don't have to
[1:16:33] live by chicken scratch
[1:16:35] they don't have to try to scratch out a
[1:16:36] living they don't have to try to eek by
[1:16:38] and compete with a bunch of chickens for
[1:16:40] chicken feed but lord may they catch the
[1:16:42] revelation
[1:16:44] that there's fresh kill there's fresh
[1:16:45] manna may they find themselves
[1:16:48] at their place at the table and receive
[1:16:50] of you
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:54] may we break this cycle this mindset in
[1:16:56] our minds lord
[1:16:59] lord i i call it back to this thought
[1:17:02] that overwhelming the beginning
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:06] of the devil attacking us
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:09] lord you're attacking the devil
[1:17:13] the only thing that's happening is a
[1:17:14] bunch of chickens are starting to
[1:17:16] realize that the eagle is waking up
[1:17:20] the eagle's recognizing who she is
[1:17:23] the eagle's recognizing that she doesn't
[1:17:26] eat chicken food but chickens are food
[1:17:30] and lord i pray that as we begin to
[1:17:32] recognize that the battle is yours that
[1:17:34] there's only victories that we have
[1:17:35] ahead of us
[1:17:37] that there's no losing there's no
[1:17:38] failure there's no fallen behind
[1:17:41] we can turn this battle around to where
[1:17:43] we realize that we're only taking
[1:17:45] richmond as we come to it richmond
[1:17:47] hasn't caught us by surprise
[1:17:49] we're not fighting because we've been
[1:17:50] ambushed we're not fighting because the
[1:17:52] devil's got one over on us
[1:17:53] we're fighting the devil because the
[1:17:55] word has found him and exposed him and
[1:17:58] he's all up in arms and he's screaming
[1:18:00] and he's slashing and he's fighting
[1:18:01] because he's having to let go of some
[1:18:03] ground
[1:18:03] that he's held for a long time lord we
[1:18:06] weren't fighting them all those years
[1:18:07] but now we're fighting them and it may
[1:18:09] seem as if it's harder but may we
[1:18:11] recognize that we're possessing
[1:18:13] more ground today than we've ever
[1:18:15] possessed before and i say lord
[1:18:17] strengthen our hands for war
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:21] strengthen these hands for war
[1:18:24] give us strength to fight
[1:18:28] be that same strength that gives us
[1:18:30] strength to fight
[1:18:32] it's going to be the same strength for
[1:18:33] flight
[1:18:36] finally break free of everything that's
[1:18:37] holding us back lord may we be fed may
[1:18:40] we be fed may we be fed lord
[1:18:43] this is our revival when we begin to
[1:18:45] thirst for you
[1:18:47] let revival come we invite it right now
[1:18:50] lord
[1:18:51] revival's been given maybe a dirty word
[1:18:53] maybe revival is kind of characterized
[1:18:55] as special meetings
[1:18:56] the bride's revival is when she begins
[1:18:58] to line up with the word of god
[1:19:00] lord send your revival now create in me
[1:19:03] the revival
[1:19:04] let me be the revival lord create in me
[1:19:07] that which is needed in me lord
[1:19:09] and may it begin now as i hunger and
[1:19:12] thirst for righteousness
[1:19:15] bless us we pray now as i commit the
[1:19:16] people to you
[1:19:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:19:20] amen
