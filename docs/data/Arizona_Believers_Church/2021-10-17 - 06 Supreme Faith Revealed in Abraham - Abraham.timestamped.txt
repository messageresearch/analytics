[0:00] genesis chapter 12 i'd like to begin
[0:02] with verse 9
[0:04] and read to verse 13.
[0:07] and abraham excuse me and abram
[0:09] journeyed going on still toward the
[0:12] south
[0:14] and there was a famine in the land and
[0:15] abram went down into egypt to soldier
[0:17] and therefore the famine was grievous in
[0:19] the land
[0:20] and it came to pass when he was come
[0:22] near to enter into egypt that he said
[0:25] unto sarah his wife behold now i know
[0:28] that thou art a fair woman to look upon
[0:30] therefore it shall come to pass when the
[0:32] egyptians shall see thee that they shall
[0:34] say this is his wife and they will kill
[0:37] me but they will save thee alive say i
[0:40] pray thee thou art my sister that it may
[0:42] be well with me for thy sake and my soul
[0:45] shall live because
[0:47] of thee
[0:49] you may be seated
[0:55] i hope to come to these verses uh fairly
[0:58] quickly this morning and i have a very
[1:01] uh i think a very uh brie uh i'm trying
[1:04] to think of the right way to say it so i
[1:05] don't create unreasonable expectations
[1:06] but just a very uh compact thought a
[1:09] very simple not maybe very broad or
[1:11] cover a lot of ground but just a very
[1:13] direct succinct compact thought
[1:16] to share with you today and it's
[1:17] continuing on the subject of supreme
[1:19] faith
[1:20] revealed in abraham
[1:22] and the last few services we were
[1:24] looking at
[1:25] the offering of isaac upon the altar in
[1:27] genesis chapter 22 and how james
[1:30] remarked that this was where abraham's
[1:33] faith was made perfect and it was in
[1:35] that act that supreme faith was
[1:37] expressed
[1:38] and we've been looking at how that it
[1:40] was connected with rapturing faith or
[1:43] the belief that god had power over death
[1:45] or could preserve life
[1:47] and so we've been making this point and
[1:49] i want to start kind of
[1:51] blend now to
[1:53] continue to emphasize that particular
[1:54] aspect that we've been looking at the
[1:56] last few services but now kind of begin
[1:58] to look at his life as a journey because
[2:00] his life holds a pattern for us and his
[2:03] example shows a type for us and
[2:06] especially for rapturing faith and
[2:08] especially he has been set forth and
[2:10] determined to be an example for the
[2:11] believer today in this hour that we're
[2:13] living now in in a laodicea in a third
[2:16] exodus in a time of a rapture
[2:19] and we've been using a statement from
[2:21] baum and gilead where brother branham
[2:22] said that we've got to move up into
[2:24] supreme faith and he says to do that you
[2:26] have to perfectly know what you're doing
[2:29] and he talks about how there's these
[2:31] regular acts of faith that we do every
[2:33] day and that that's the way that it is
[2:35] with god that there's you trust god on a
[2:37] daily basis and you trust him so much
[2:39] and he comes through and fulfills his
[2:41] word so often that it just becomes he
[2:43] says regular routine
[2:44] and he says that's the way the rapture
[2:46] is going to be just being in the regular
[2:48] routine of following the scripture and
[2:49] god's plan
[2:51] so we look at abraham's faith and we see
[2:53] that it grew as he routinely trusted
[2:56] god's promises to him
[2:58] his faith grew as he as a matter of
[3:00] routine as a matter of habit and
[3:02] discipline he believed whatever god said
[3:04] he watched god fulfill it and that grew
[3:06] his faith and he could arise to meet the
[3:08] next challenge
[3:10] and you'll also begin to see even today
[3:12] as we read we'll begin in genesis
[3:14] chapter 11
[3:15] that there is
[3:17] uh he hears the word and he obeys and
[3:19] there's acts of obedience and there's
[3:20] acts of worship and and there was overt
[3:23] acts and obvious acts of worship where
[3:25] he's building an altar and he's
[3:27] expressing a different worship contrary
[3:29] to the prevailing worship of the time
[3:31] that he was living in
[3:33] and so this is where i want to kind of
[3:35] reset on some things that we said at the
[3:36] very outset when we began to minister
[3:38] several parts ago
[3:40] is that with abraham he was an ordinary
[3:42] man
[3:43] he was there was nothing about his
[3:44] lineage nor was there anything about his
[3:46] life that stood out to where god would
[3:48] say you're righteous man you're a worthy
[3:50] man but god chose him by grace and so
[3:53] he's an ordinary man whom god elected
[3:56] and then makes an
[3:58] unconditional promise to him
[4:00] and this is different than the promise
[4:01] he made to adam it's different than the
[4:03] promise he made to noah he now chooses
[4:06] and we can say with adam you can say
[4:07] there's an election involved but he's
[4:08] the involved but there's only one man
[4:10] and then you can say with noah he makes
[4:12] a covenant with noah and you say well
[4:13] there's there certainly is a grace and
[4:15] an election involved but when he makes
[4:16] the covenant there's only one patriarch
[4:18] there he's the he's the father who
[4:20] carries his family over on the other
[4:21] side of the flood and those covenants
[4:23] were were a conditional if you will i
[4:26] will but with abraham something we've
[4:29] got to recognize is that god makes an
[4:31] unconditional promise to him and he
[4:34] chooses abraham out of multitudes of
[4:36] people by election
[4:38] and this is
[4:40] this will be my theme today something an
[4:42] underlying theme that i hope to visit uh
[4:44] a few times as we go forward in the
[4:46] scriptures today abraham is the father
[4:48] of our faith
[4:50] he's a legend in scripture he's the
[4:52] father of the nation of israel he's the
[4:53] father of faith to the spiritual seed
[4:56] and the royal seed of abraham he is the
[4:58] he's even the father of islam and he's
[5:02] looked to by
[5:03] billions of people in the world today as
[5:05] the father of their faith and their
[5:06] religion and his faith is memorialized
[5:09] in the new testament and he's constantly
[5:10] referred to by jesus and even those in
[5:12] the days of
[5:13] of christ who defended themselves we are
[5:15] of our father abraham and he has such
[5:17] extraordinary faith and his record
[5:20] uh especially once you get to the new
[5:22] testament is pristine and he believed
[5:24] god and he staggered not in unbelief and
[5:26] so being our father of faith we almost
[5:28] can make him an idol of our faith just
[5:30] something that we venerate and admire
[5:33] and look up to but we never feel that we
[5:35] could walk in those steps
[5:37] and so we make his faith impossible to
[5:39] achieve or impractical in the time that
[5:41] we're living in but what i want to do
[5:43] today is begin to make his faith
[5:45] relatable
[5:46] to where we begin to look at his life
[5:48] and then his faith and be able to relate
[5:50] and say oh well abraham's responding and
[5:52] we won't be exhausted today but he's
[5:55] responding to certain situations maybe
[5:57] in the same way i would and then yet you
[5:59] see that his faith comes on the scene
[6:01] open uh
[6:02] ultimately
[6:03] and then we can have courage that our
[6:05] faith will arise and meet the challenge
[6:07] whenever we're put in a situation that
[6:09] we need it so we want to make his faith
[6:11] relatable and then also encourage our
[6:13] faith to grow
[6:14] now if you'll take your bibles and look
[6:16] at genesis chapter 11 or take your eyes
[6:19] your bifocals your glasses your
[6:21] slideshow your ipad your phone however
[6:23] it is you'll take the scriptures today
[6:25] but if you'll take your bibles and turn
[6:27] to genesis chapter 11
[6:28] i want to begin reading in verse 29 and
[6:31] then continue into chapter 12
[6:34] for several verses i think maybe 13
[6:36] verses or so in chapter 12 just to kind
[6:38] of read this narrative and pick up on a
[6:40] specific theme
[6:43] in the text that we read or a particular
[6:45] incident
[6:46] so it says in abram and nehor took them
[6:48] wives the name of abram's wife was sarah
[6:51] and the name of nehor's wife milka the
[6:53] daughter of haran the father of milka
[6:55] and the father of iska
[6:57] it's interesting that a number of people
[6:59] commentators believe that iska was also
[7:02] sarah but um it's kind of difficult
[7:04] maybe to come to that conclusion but it
[7:06] reads really that milka and iska are um
[7:11] children of haran so nehor's wife is
[7:13] milka the daughter of haran you see that
[7:15] there's half siblings that are marrying
[7:18] and then in verse 30 it says but sarah
[7:21] was barren she had no child and that's
[7:24] very interesting as you read this
[7:26] but it is setting us up as an important
[7:29] context to abraham's life and his
[7:32] mindset and his family life and and even
[7:35] things that were natural or things that
[7:37] were physically possible for him abraham
[7:40] has a wife but his wife is barren she
[7:42] has no children he has no children and
[7:45] then it just kind of continues in the
[7:46] narrative but i want you to notice how
[7:48] the scripture even before we really
[7:51] learn uh see what's taking place almost
[7:53] in this genealogy it's no abraham has no
[7:56] children
[7:57] and that sarah herself is barren and
[7:59] tara took abram his son
[8:01] and lot the son of haran his son's son
[8:03] and sarah his daughter-in-law his son
[8:06] abra abram's wife and they went forth
[8:09] with them from ur of the chaldees to go
[8:11] into the land of canaan now it's we
[8:14] understand that abram's the one that's
[8:15] called terror going with him as the
[8:17] father is giving kind of the credit as
[8:19] the leader but yet we know according to
[8:22] uh the new testament and other places
[8:24] that it's god that called abram in ur
[8:26] and it's his move that kind of attracts
[8:28] his father and other family members to
[8:30] go with them
[8:31] and they came unto haran and dwelt there
[8:34] and the days of terror were 205 years
[8:37] and terra died in haren so that kind of
[8:40] gives us some background to the life of
[8:41] abram he marries his half-sister sarah
[8:45] he's leaving with his brother and his
[8:46] wives and he's leaving with his father
[8:48] and they leave ur and they go into haren
[8:51] and it's believed that abraham was about
[8:53] 70 years old
[8:55] when god called him out of her and he
[8:57] moved to haran
[8:59] and he's in haran for about five years
[9:01] so he's there for about a five year
[9:03] period before god then moves him out of
[9:06] haran and as he moves out of her end the
[9:08] scripture wants us to recognize that his
[9:10] father stays behind and ultimately his
[9:12] father dies in haran so abram is called
[9:15] further they all go out together
[9:17] five-year period and haran then abram's
[9:19] called further his father remains behind
[9:22] and his father passes away but what we
[9:24] read in genesis 11 and even one thing
[9:27] that kind of reinforced my desire and
[9:29] the inspiration to
[9:31] use these scriptures at the outset is
[9:33] these are the first steps of abraham's
[9:35] progressive obedience to god's promises
[9:38] when we read this these are the first
[9:39] steps of his journey of faith and so it
[9:42] may not seem to be very extraordinary
[9:44] and it may even just seem to be a little
[9:45] bit not of a direct line and maybe not
[9:48] fully in compliance with what god asked
[9:50] him to do as we see here in a moment
[9:52] these are the first steps
[9:54] and we're going to read in genesis
[9:55] chapter 12 what god asked him to do but
[9:57] no matter how small they may seem or how
[9:59] much in the wrong direction it may seem
[10:01] that he's going or how much of time it
[10:03] took for him to take the step and
[10:05] finally find the place that god would
[10:06] show him these are the first steps of
[10:08] abraham's progressive revelation and
[10:11] progressive obedience to god's word
[10:13] and we look at it and liken it to a
[10:15] journey of faith
[10:17] and so abraham is in a journey of faith
[10:20] and we want to make that relatable to us
[10:23] that we are in a journey of faith and
[10:25] and you see different people's uh
[10:26] ministries or their lives their
[10:28] testimonies and we start because we're
[10:30] wired to compare we start comparing and
[10:32] trying to measure up and maybe your
[10:33] testimony doesn't seem as extraordinary
[10:36] as somebody else's but i tell you it
[10:38] will be just as ordinary as abraham's
[10:41] because god speaks to him and he begins
[10:42] to obey and whatever small measure it is
[10:44] in in whatever way that he can obey it
[10:46] however else it progressed i believe
[10:47] that it can become relatable
[10:49] now the scripture tells us that lot his
[10:51] nephew leaves with abraham
[10:54] and i just feel to point this out
[10:55] because it um it's part of a theme in
[10:58] abraham's life
[10:59] that it doesn't seem to be
[11:01] wrong on its faith face that lot would
[11:04] leave with him but as you read the next
[11:06] verses you'll see how god had asked him
[11:08] to separate
[11:09] and god isn't going to further unfold
[11:11] his promise nor is he going to bless
[11:13] abraham
[11:14] until he fully separates
[11:16] that's an important part to recognize so
[11:18] then in verse 1 of chapter 12 now the
[11:20] lord had said and this is
[11:23] if we just kind of took the chapter out
[11:25] of it this we kind of just read together
[11:27] as it's saying that abram leaves er he
[11:30] leaves quran he's coming down he's going
[11:32] to be coming down south then this is why
[11:34] because god had spoken to him now the
[11:36] lord had said unto abram
[11:39] get thee out of thy country in from thy
[11:42] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[11:45] a land that i will show thee
[11:48] let's recognize this is god's calling he
[11:50] calls abram by election
[11:52] this is his calling this is him singling
[11:54] him out this is god speaking to him but
[11:56] then it's also important for us to
[11:58] recognize that this is god's command
[12:01] god has given him a command leave your
[12:03] country leave your father's house leave
[12:05] your people
[12:07] and he had left the country but yet as
[12:09] he journeys to haran he still has his
[12:11] father there he has his
[12:12] nephew there he has his kindred and
[12:14] family there and then as he begins to
[12:16] leave her on his family is still
[12:17] following
[12:19] yet he's walking by faith as we see here
[12:22] unto a land that i will show thee he's
[12:24] walking by faith to an unknown land
[12:26] and if you looked at it on a map and you
[12:28] saw his journey from ur of the caldis
[12:30] and you saw his journey it would look to
[12:32] be maybe the most logical geographical
[12:36] route to take into canaan and following
[12:39] along a river and following a a easier
[12:41] geological path
[12:43] uh than maybe any other way that he
[12:44] could go so he's following in the right
[12:46] path and ultimately five years later so
[12:48] he's making his way now he's going to
[12:50] begin to journey down south as it says
[12:52] that um
[12:53] abram is is
[12:55] goes forth from ur and then he comes to
[12:58] iran and he's going to be there for so
[12:59] long and he's going to be called out so
[13:01] it says abram get thee out of that
[13:03] country this is god's command this is
[13:05] god's calling now verse two
[13:07] to me is uh
[13:09] i want this just to be absorbed you
[13:11] absorb it and really think about the
[13:12] implications like if god made this
[13:14] promise to you what could you
[13:16] immediately begin to assume
[13:18] it says and i will make of thee a great
[13:20] nation and i will bless thee
[13:23] i'm going to make you a great nation and
[13:24] think of this i will bless thee and make
[13:26] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[13:28] blessing and i will bless them that
[13:30] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[13:32] thee and in thee shall all families of
[13:35] the earth be blessed there's a lot this
[13:38] is a mouthful there's a lot here that
[13:39] you could just cabbage down on for a
[13:41] very very very long time but this is the
[13:44] first covenant of god with abraham
[13:46] and it's the foundational promise what's
[13:49] contained here is the foundational
[13:50] promise that abraham seeks after
[13:53] the very things that god says here i'll
[13:54] make you a great nation and i will bless
[13:56] thee i'll make your name great you're
[13:57] going to be a blessing and then to say
[13:59] that all the families and the earth are
[14:00] going to be blessed this is what abraham
[14:03] is following after and seeking from the
[14:04] very moment that god speaks to him
[14:07] and when he says i'll make thee a great
[14:08] nation it means i'm going to cause you
[14:09] to be a father of a great nation i'm
[14:11] going to cause you to be a father of
[14:13] many descendants
[14:15] now we read this and
[14:17] we immediately go back to genesis 11 30
[14:20] that says but sarah has no children
[14:22] abraham has no children he has one wife
[14:23] he has no children but yet now god is
[14:26] promising abram that i'm going to make
[14:28] you a father of many descendants you're
[14:30] going to be a great nation and it's it's
[14:32] not just saying a large family
[14:34] but you're going to be such a you're
[14:36] going to be so great that you will have
[14:38] multitudes of people multitudes of
[14:40] families that are going to be identified
[14:42] as a nation many many descendants and
[14:45] then he makes this statement so i want
[14:46] you to recognize this a lot of children
[14:48] a lot of offspring a lot of descendants
[14:50] enough to be a nation
[14:52] and then he says all families of the
[14:53] earth will be blessed
[14:55] so this speaks to just the breadth and
[14:58] and how broad and pervasive this promise
[15:01] was
[15:03] all families of the earth will be
[15:04] blessed he's when this is spoken to
[15:06] abraham he this ought to have resonated
[15:09] with him to think wow i'm just one man
[15:12] living here living in this part of the
[15:14] country having left the counties i've
[15:16] come to haran
[15:17] and
[15:18] or as god speaks to him in ur he thinks
[15:20] of himself how how is everyone in the
[15:22] world
[15:24] going to be blessed by me
[15:26] how could in this time in this day in
[15:28] this age uh uh all families of the earth
[15:32] uh be blessed in in me through me
[15:35] and so this speaks to just how expansive
[15:37] and how huge god's promise is to abram
[15:41] so abram he's hearing this and
[15:43] he would have had this liberty to begin
[15:45] to think of what the implications were
[15:47] okay you're gonna you're gonna give me
[15:48] many descendants i'm gonna have many
[15:50] children then it would have been fair
[15:51] for him to assume that he was gonna have
[15:53] at least a son right
[15:54] would have been fair for him to assume
[15:55] that that the the things that his seed
[15:58] would do and even through him that it
[16:00] would touch on all of humanity all
[16:02] families in the earth would be blessed
[16:03] abram would not have been out of line to
[16:05] begin to think of wow what does this
[16:07] mean in practice what does this mean in
[16:09] outcome
[16:11] and so it says so abram departed verse 4
[16:14] as the lord had spoken unto him
[16:17] and lot went with him so god is speaking
[16:19] to him he's departing he's even going
[16:20] out of haran now
[16:22] and it says that he departed as god had
[16:24] spoke to him
[16:26] you find it mentioned again time and
[16:28] again that abraham's doing
[16:30] according to what god told him to do
[16:32] and he's answering by obedience to the
[16:34] things that god asked him to do and then
[16:36] it gives us this context and abram was
[16:38] 75 years old when he departed out of
[16:40] haran so when he's leaving haran he is
[16:42] 75 years old
[16:44] and abram took sarah his wife
[16:46] and and lot his brother's son and again
[16:49] you could recognize that he was told to
[16:51] get away from his father's house told to
[16:53] get away from his kindred but yet
[16:54] they're still kind of hanging around and
[16:56] all their substance that they had
[16:58] gathered these would be their
[16:59] possessions and the souls that they had
[17:01] gotten in haram this would speak to
[17:03] livestock and cattle and animals but
[17:05] also any servants that they might have
[17:07] had in hurren and they went for to go
[17:10] into the land of canaan
[17:13] so now it seems it's kind of
[17:14] crystallizing we read it now because uh
[17:17] we've read the choose your own adventure
[17:18] and we've gotten to the end and we've
[17:19] read all the scenarios and we know what
[17:21] canaan is it's the promised land we
[17:23] recognize the borders and so when we
[17:25] read this you mean like oh this is it
[17:27] this is the land but to abram it would
[17:29] have it would have just been the next
[17:31] thing god had showed him
[17:32] and he's entered into canaan and it's
[17:34] not at this point it's not necessarily
[17:36] apparent that abram shows up and cain is
[17:38] like i own this this is mine and starts
[17:40] telling all the canaanites to get out
[17:42] but yet he arrives at this place that is
[17:44] going to be very very significant and it
[17:46] says and into the land of canaan they
[17:48] came so they go forth into to go into it
[17:51] so there's a pro it's even speaks to
[17:53] process it speaks to progress it's
[17:55] they're in a journey and they go they're
[17:57] leaving to go into it and it says and
[17:59] into the land they went and into the
[18:01] land they came
[18:02] and now it speaks further this journey
[18:04] and abram passed through the land under
[18:06] the place of shechem under the plain of
[18:08] mora and the canaanite was then in the
[18:11] land so there was a people that dwelled
[18:12] there very evil people wicked cruel
[18:14] fierce people so he passes through the
[18:16] land to the place of shechem under the
[18:18] plain of mora and there's people there's
[18:20] other inhabitants there
[18:22] and the lord appeared unto abram a very
[18:25] significant event and said
[18:27] unto thy seed will i give this land
[18:31] they recognize this there's people
[18:33] living there
[18:34] he's just showed up
[18:37] he doesn't have any family there history
[18:39] there he comes from he comes from beyond
[18:41] he's one that's crossed over and he's
[18:43] given this promise unto thy seed will i
[18:45] give this land and then abraham's
[18:47] response and there builded he an altar
[18:49] unto the lord who appeared unto him
[18:52] it's critical to recognize how
[18:55] the one he's worshipping is the one who
[18:57] makes himself known to him he's not
[18:59] worshiping an unknown god he's not
[19:00] worshiping a god that can be seen
[19:03] by natural eye in a false image or in
[19:05] the sky but it's a god who's made
[19:07] himself known to him the god who appears
[19:10] it's important to kind of catch this uh
[19:12] this
[19:13] reference or this characterization he
[19:15] built an altar to worship the god who
[19:17] appears unto him
[19:19] who's made himself known unto him
[19:21] so this is the statement that god makes
[19:23] to him he's already told him in genesis
[19:25] the first few verses there of the
[19:26] chapter get out of your country from
[19:28] that kindred from the father's house
[19:29] unto a land i'll show you and i'll make
[19:31] you a great nation and i will bless thee
[19:34] and in thee shall all the families of
[19:35] the earth be blessed and now he
[19:37] identifies the land
[19:39] he said i'm going to show you later but
[19:41] now he says unto thy seed
[19:43] will i give this land in this statement
[19:45] unto thy seed it means unto thy
[19:47] offspring so as we've already been told
[19:49] abram is married and his wife is unable
[19:51] to have children abram and sarah do not
[19:54] have children
[19:55] but yet god's promise to him is i'm
[19:57] going to make you a great nation you're
[19:58] going to be the father of many
[19:59] descendants and he says unto your
[20:01] offspring unto your descendants i'm
[20:03] going to give this land so he's
[20:04] confirming to him
[20:06] that he will bring forth many
[20:08] descendants
[20:09] even though he doesn't have any children
[20:11] presently he said you're going to have
[20:12] children
[20:14] so abram had to believe that he was
[20:16] going to have children and then he says
[20:18] this land when he says i'll give this
[20:20] land the promise comes into view
[20:22] this was the land i told you that i was
[20:24] going to show you remember when i called
[20:25] you in chaldea and i called you out and
[20:28] you were to travel to a land that i was
[20:29] going to show you now the promise
[20:31] unfolds further this is the land that i
[20:33] was going to give you this is the place
[20:34] of promise this is where you're going to
[20:36] dwell and he says this is the land that
[20:38] i give to you
[20:40] i'm going to give you this the lord is
[20:41] going to give him this land as a
[20:43] possession
[20:44] it's going to be yours though there be
[20:46] canaanites here this land is going to be
[20:48] yours and your seed are going to possess
[20:50] it unto thy seed will i give this land
[20:54] now remember that promise and how that
[20:56] could have worked upon abraham's
[20:58] understanding and what it would have
[20:59] meant to him i'm going to have children
[21:02] and we're going to possess this land
[21:04] verse 8 and he removed from fence unto a
[21:06] mountain on the east of bethel he's
[21:08] still journeying he comes to a place of
[21:10] shashim and the plain of mora but he
[21:11] still journeys still traveling in this
[21:13] land of canaan he moved from fence into
[21:14] a mountain on the east of bethel and
[21:16] pitched his tent having bethel on the
[21:18] west and high on the east
[21:20] and there he builded an altar unto the
[21:22] lord
[21:23] and called upon the name of the lord in
[21:25] his journey he's continuing to worship
[21:28] in his journey he's not is he obeying
[21:30] but he's worshipping and his worship is
[21:33] uh uh external even to build an altar
[21:35] others could observe him worshiping and
[21:37] so he's not just this secret follower of
[21:39] god and he's kind of this well this
[21:40] secret person is speaking to me but he's
[21:42] not afraid to be identified with this
[21:44] unseen god and he says and he called
[21:46] upon the name of the lord
[21:48] it's not that he just verbalized lord or
[21:50] adonai but he invokes the name of
[21:52] jehovah
[21:53] so it shows that there's there's a
[21:55] deeper understanding that's coming to
[21:57] abram as he walks that he he worships
[21:59] the god who appears unto him now he
[22:01] worships again but now as he worships to
[22:03] him he begins to call upon the neighbor
[22:06] he's going to invoke jehovah
[22:08] and as invoking jehovah it's as if
[22:10] there's an understanding even we look at
[22:13] it now and it's like my it's almost as
[22:15] if he is now beginning to invoke the the
[22:18] the revelation of the messiah that in
[22:20] all and these shall all the families of
[22:22] the earth be blessed and he's having
[22:24] this understanding begins to invoke
[22:25] jehovah
[22:26] and yahweh and he's declaring this this
[22:29] unction of they're going to there's a
[22:31] jehovah and there's a god who who has
[22:33] these characteristics and these
[22:34] attributes so this is a this is a
[22:37] circumstance where it indicates a deeper
[22:39] understanding that abram has as he walks
[22:42] with god
[22:44] verse nine and abram journeyed going on
[22:46] still towards the south you see kind of
[22:49] a theme with him
[22:50] he leaves her and he goes to haran he's
[22:52] there for five years but now he's going
[22:53] to go
[22:54] he's leaving to go into canaan and then
[22:57] he goes into canaan and then he
[22:59] continues to travel in kane into bethel
[23:01] now going further south
[23:03] and there was a famine this is verse 10
[23:06] to me is kind of where it starts to get
[23:08] more detailed and specific and there was
[23:09] a famine in the land
[23:11] and abram went down into egypt to
[23:13] soldier in there because
[23:16] for the famine was grievous in the land
[23:19] so recognize this and i realize i'm kind
[23:22] of maybe telling a story and
[23:24] as we go through this and reading it
[23:25] chronologically because i'm wanting to
[23:27] now begin to kind of set the scene
[23:30] for what it stands out to me as i read
[23:31] these things
[23:33] famine is what causes him to leave the
[23:35] land of promise
[23:37] it's famine that does it it it the bible
[23:39] is making it very clear that he's
[23:41] following the command of god to go into
[23:43] canaan even as he journeys south he's
[23:45] worshipping the lord and he's building
[23:46] an altar but now as his fam famine comes
[23:49] and it's letting us know that now abram
[23:52] is perhaps being motivated by different
[23:54] factors than the voice that spoke to him
[23:56] when he was in earth
[23:57] and he's looking at different
[23:58] circumstances so famine causes him to
[24:00] lead leave the land that was promised
[24:02] him as a possession to him and who his
[24:05] offspring
[24:06] say this is your land they give it to
[24:08] you and your seed after you but now
[24:09] other things begin to happen and he's
[24:11] looking at this famine and it causes him
[24:13] to leave
[24:14] now this is where i want us to be able
[24:15] to relate to abraham a little bit and if
[24:17] you felt like well
[24:18] you know help me relate to abraham by
[24:20] the fact that he was so strong in faith
[24:22] and never doubted well i kind of want to
[24:24] make you make him more relatable so we
[24:26] can kind of see where his weaknesses are
[24:28] and if that's not encouraging i
[24:29] apologize maybe i should have just said
[24:31] you're all super men and super women and
[24:33] you have the faith of abraham but i want
[24:34] to make him relatable by just looking at
[24:36] his progress
[24:38] and he came into certain crises and
[24:40] situations and he didn't always handle
[24:42] him perfectly
[24:44] and so god think about this god had
[24:46] already made a promise to him
[24:49] we could even say it this way that he'd
[24:51] promised him blessings i will bless you
[24:54] i'm going to give you this land
[24:57] and i'm going to give you children and
[24:58] they're going to have this land as well
[25:00] so abram was sitting there going god's
[25:01] going to bless me jehovah's going to
[25:03] bless him i've called upon the name lord
[25:04] wherever he went in his journey he's
[25:06] built altars and worshiped uh
[25:08] and
[25:09] i'm kind of just maybe going off of just
[25:12] maybe assumption right now but i don't
[25:14] recall him building an altar in egypt
[25:16] and worshipping
[25:18] and so now he's he's deviating from his
[25:20] journey he's deviating a little bit from
[25:22] his path but yet god said i'll bless you
[25:25] i'm going to give you children
[25:27] i'm going to give you a land and this
[25:28] land is so much yours it's to your seed
[25:30] after you
[25:32] and because of this promise to him he
[25:34] didn't need to fret
[25:35] about this terrible famine that was in
[25:37] the land
[25:38] ponder that for a moment the bible tells
[25:40] us there was a famine that came up in
[25:42] the land and then abraham went down into
[25:44] egypt to live there for a while soul
[25:45] journey is going down there temporarily
[25:47] for because the famine was grievous so
[25:50] why did abram leave the land of promise
[25:52] and leave canaan and go down into egypt
[25:54] because there was a famine in the
[25:55] promised land
[25:57] but yet knowing what god had spoken to
[25:59] him he had no reason to fear the famine
[26:02] no matter how bad it was in the land he
[26:04] had no reason to fear the threat of
[26:06] death why would you leave when there's a
[26:07] famine you're afraid you won't be able
[26:09] to be sustained you're afraid you won't
[26:10] be able to provide and so he had no
[26:12] reason to leave because god's promise
[26:15] assumed preservation
[26:18] think about it god's promise he says i'm
[26:20] going to bless you and i'm going to give
[26:21] you children if abram was sitting there
[26:23] without any children he could say you
[26:24] know what this famine can't take me
[26:26] because i don't have kids
[26:29] he could have made he could have come to
[26:30] certain conclusions based upon the
[26:32] promise that god gave him
[26:34] so this is what i want you to begin to
[26:36] think about this moved into egypt
[26:38] indicates some uncertainty on his part
[26:42] or at the very least a lack of
[26:43] understanding
[26:45] concerning the promise
[26:47] that he's he's been he's been placed in
[26:49] the land that's his with the promise of
[26:51] blessing that that assumed preservation
[26:54] and he starts looking at all these other
[26:56] things going on around him and he panics
[26:58] a little bit and he goes down into egypt
[27:00] and i'm suggesting that there was some
[27:02] uncertainty or he didn't fully
[27:04] understand what the promise meant
[27:07] and so when abram leaves the promised
[27:09] land and goes into egypt it creates a
[27:11] danger zone for him
[27:14] but now he's left the land god says
[27:15] leave and go into a land that i'll show
[27:17] you and what he says to abram never it's
[27:20] never spoken in what we read to say and
[27:23] kind of hang out for a little bit and
[27:24] things get tough abandoning
[27:26] it it doesn't tell us that god gave him
[27:28] a backup plan it doesn't tell him to
[27:30] travel and continue south and then as
[27:31] you continue south there's going to be a
[27:33] famine but you're going to continue to
[27:34] go down into egypt
[27:36] and hang out there for a while and since
[27:38] we don't see this explicitly in god's
[27:40] commandment to him it's it's we could
[27:43] assume that he may be deviating from
[27:45] god's explicit commandment and leaving
[27:48] the place of promise the place of
[27:49] protection the place of pleasure the
[27:52] place of provision and as he leaves this
[27:54] he puts himself in a danger zone
[27:57] and this is the lesson for us
[27:59] that when we leave where he promises to
[28:02] bless us where we leave the place that
[28:04] he's called us we enter into a danger
[28:06] zone where his blessings can be withheld
[28:08] and blessings being withheld opens us up
[28:10] to difficulties and triumphs
[28:13] and i would say that as we examine this
[28:15] in the life of abraham that the lesson
[28:16] would be trust god
[28:19] trust trust his promise that he's made
[28:21] to you if he says i've given you this
[28:23] land i've placed you here this is where
[28:25] i want to bless you i've opened these
[28:26] doors i've set you in this situation
[28:29] then no matter what gets taken away or
[28:30] how bad it gets or how much of a famine
[28:33] or things aren't quite working a while
[28:35] out the way that you thought they were
[28:36] go back to the promise go back to what
[28:38] he showed you trust his promises and
[28:41] yield to his process
[28:43] abram had every reason to look around
[28:45] and say there's a famine here this is
[28:46] getting tough god you promised to bless
[28:49] me
[28:50] god you promised that there would be
[28:51] seed after me therefore there has to be
[28:53] substance to sustain these bodies and to
[28:56] keep me and my wife alive
[28:58] but in leaving it created a danger zone
[29:01] and the message recognizing today and
[29:03] its message brother bam says god never
[29:04] blesses israel outside of the land
[29:08] abraham went outside the land was
[29:10] condemned
[29:12] so these are his words as he expresses
[29:14] this
[29:15] and he's talking about how israel is
[29:16] back in its homeland he's showing how
[29:18] what great things are transpiring in the
[29:19] hour that we're living in how the
[29:20] israel's back in his homeland and
[29:22] there's where god can make himself known
[29:24] to her there's where god can bless her
[29:25] but then he introduces us to this
[29:27] thought abraham went outside the land
[29:29] was condemned everyone that leaves the
[29:31] land is condemned
[29:33] now i want you to think about that
[29:34] everyone who leaves the land anybody who
[29:36] leaves the place that god has put them
[29:39] and promised them blessings condemns
[29:41] themselves
[29:42] everyone that means you if god has
[29:44] placed you somewhere and has promised
[29:46] you a blessing to leave that place opens
[29:49] you up to difficulties and trials and
[29:51] hardships and persecutions um
[29:55] beyond what you are would if you were
[29:57] just suffering for well-doing
[30:00] it says everyone that leaves the land is
[30:01] condemned god can only bless israel when
[30:04] she stays in her homeland
[30:07] and she's there now as a nation and then
[30:09] he makes this statement
[30:13] and i'm leaving this
[30:15] i left this in even though it kind of
[30:16] seemed like it
[30:17] uh it's speaking more to the situation
[30:20] for israel in present day but i want you
[30:21] to relate to abraham he says the church
[30:23] is called
[30:25] she's just only waiting for the rapture
[30:27] of the bride taken out israel
[30:30] before god can deal with her further is
[30:31] waiting for you to be to be raptured
[30:34] the bride has been called she is waiting
[30:37] for the climax of the rapture the change
[30:40] of body to meet the lord in the air
[30:42] that's where things are and he says the
[30:43] seals are open it's revealed to us
[30:47] these very things are opened up to us
[30:49] it's the seals are open it's revealed to
[30:51] us i want you to recognize this as your
[30:52] homeland i want you to recognize the
[30:55] seals being opened to you opened up to
[30:57] you a whole new land of promise it's the
[30:59] promised land of the son of man it is a
[31:01] revelation to us it is his promise and
[31:04] it's the bride's possession and i want
[31:05] there to be a caution that's where god
[31:08] is placing his bride and he can't bless
[31:10] you if you leave that revelation
[31:13] if you try to add to it you try to take
[31:15] it away you begin to start trying to
[31:16] doubt it or or modified or have some
[31:19] kind of revisionist history then you're
[31:20] removing yourself from the place that
[31:22] god has blessed you because as the
[31:23] church progressed god opened up these
[31:26] things as the bride's possession and
[31:29] it's there that god is going to bless
[31:31] you and it's there that the blessing of
[31:33] rapture is promised
[31:35] but abraham went outside the land as
[31:37] we're looking at him in this journey
[31:38] we'll look at verse 11 now as we
[31:39] continue genesis 12 11. he went outside
[31:42] the land and he's condemned so
[31:44] i there's a lot of other statements i
[31:46] could use to verify how that abraham
[31:48] isn't necessarily marching perfectly in
[31:49] the will of god when he goes down into
[31:51] egypt
[31:52] and it came to pass when he come near to
[31:54] enter into egypt that he said unto sarah
[31:56] his wife
[31:57] behold now i i know that thou art a fair
[32:00] woman to look upon
[32:02] therefore and she was 10 years younger
[32:04] than him
[32:05] and and was
[32:06] on the account of
[32:08] good living in good air and they say the
[32:10] mountainous air and different things
[32:11] they there's a lot of speculation as to
[32:13] why she would have been so beautiful but
[32:14] abram recognized realizes that you're
[32:17] fair to look on
[32:18] and he says therefore it shall come to
[32:20] pass when the egyptians shall see thee
[32:22] that they shall say this is his wife
[32:24] and they will kill me but they'll save
[32:26] thee alive in other words they had
[32:28] enough
[32:29] decency about them to kill her husband
[32:31] in order to take her as a wife so i know
[32:33] that's some respect or what it is but
[32:35] yet he realized that they're going to
[32:36] want you and they won't take you to be a
[32:38] wife unless i'm out of the way so
[32:39] they're going to kill you and he says
[32:41] say i pray thee thou art my sister that
[32:44] it may be well with me for thy sake
[32:47] and my soul shall live because of thee
[32:52] i i just want to get right to the point
[32:54] he's afraid of death
[32:57] abram's afraid of dying
[32:59] and being afraid of death he instigates
[33:01] the lie
[33:02] and he wants his wife to lie and it be
[33:05] in her lie and him joining being
[33:07] complicit with her in the life that by a
[33:09] lie his soul is going to be saved
[33:10] through sarah
[33:12] now think about it we know the promise
[33:14] the promise to abraham is going to be
[33:16] through sarah she'll be through her womb
[33:18] that the promise to him is rescued and
[33:20] the promise to him unfolds and comes to
[33:23] further blessing but look at how he's
[33:24] looking at it now he's saying hey we
[33:26] need to lie that my soul may be saved
[33:28] because of thee he's motivated i want
[33:30] you to catch this very simple this is
[33:32] how compact my thought is today he's
[33:34] motivated by the fear of death
[33:37] and he lies to spare his life and he
[33:40] encourages his wife to lie to spare his
[33:43] life
[33:44] and what he does is he resorts to his
[33:46] own wisdom he resorts to his own
[33:48] approach
[33:51] and he he's put in this position to lie
[33:53] because he left the land
[33:55] had he stayed in in canaan he wouldn't
[33:58] have not been in a situation where all
[34:00] of a sudden he's looking at all these
[34:01] egyptians look at his wife says hey
[34:02] you're a rare beauty here they're gonna
[34:04] want you
[34:05] why don't we lie and say that you're my
[34:06] sister so that they don't kill me to
[34:08] take you in other words let them take
[34:10] you but don't let them kill me
[34:11] because you're just my sister
[34:14] and that way i'll live so
[34:15] listen i hate to call abraham out on
[34:17] this but
[34:19] he doesn't care if they take her he just
[34:20] didn't want to die
[34:22] right it's kind of like when you're
[34:24] hiking in the wilderness with your wife
[34:25] and you're told that there's bears the
[34:27] only thing you worry about is whether or
[34:28] not you're faster than your wife
[34:32] and and so there's this abraham's not
[34:34] really concerned so much about her
[34:35] well-being he's not thinking through
[34:37] this completely but he's resorting to
[34:39] this uh uh you know lying and his own
[34:42] wisdom and doing his own thing let's let
[34:44] we're down here in egypt and let my soul
[34:46] be preserved that my soul may live let's
[34:49] lie and misrepresent the truth so that
[34:51] we can survive
[34:53] all right so i just want you to catch
[34:54] that genesis chapter 12
[34:57] we get we're this is the most
[35:00] uh as a matter of fact i mean this is
[35:02] the first time we're really hearing
[35:02] abraham talk right
[35:04] what's he doing lying
[35:07] i want to introduce you to abram hi um
[35:09] this is my sister full sister 100 my
[35:11] sister not my wife
[35:12] this is this is your introduction to the
[35:14] character of abram as he comes down
[35:16] through here
[35:18] and he
[35:22] offers this excuse of this lie to save
[35:25] his life now i want to quickly cover
[35:29] very quickly cover several chapters
[35:32] because there's a lot that happens in
[35:33] abraham's life over a nearly 25-year
[35:36] period after this after this instance in
[35:38] genesis chapter 12
[35:40] how that uh
[35:42] even i i took it out to read could have
[35:44] read all the way to verse 20 how that
[35:46] pharaoh's house is plagued and so the
[35:48] remainder of the chapter uh kind of
[35:49] deals with how god deals with pharaoh's
[35:51] house because he took abraham's wife and
[35:53] how the abraham gets his wife back and
[35:55] then he's going to he's going to return
[35:59] back out of egypt in chapter 13.
[36:02] but there's so there's a lot that
[36:03] transpires in the next several chapters
[36:04] god appears in genesis 13 to him and he
[36:07] confirms the con the promise
[36:09] genesis chapter 13 the very next chapter
[36:12] abraham and lot separate and god renews
[36:14] his covenant with him and he gives more
[36:16] detail when he renews his covenant with
[36:17] them after a lot separates he gives them
[36:19] more details the promise that he'd given
[36:20] to him before
[36:22] genesis chapter 14 it's the battle of
[36:24] the kings and lot is captured and then
[36:26] and he rescues uh he a rescues lot and
[36:29] then he meets melchizedek melchizedek
[36:31] blesses abraham that happens in chapter
[36:33] 14. in genesis chapter 15 the lord
[36:36] appears to him in a vision
[36:37] and he says this after these things the
[36:40] word of the lord came unto abram in a
[36:41] vision after melchizedek appears to him
[36:44] and he says fear not
[36:47] so now he's renewed the covenant there's
[36:48] a lot of events that are taking place
[36:50] milk and he goes out and he rescues his
[36:52] uh his nephew lot with 318 trained
[36:54] servants and now god wants to speak to
[36:57] me appears to him in a vision and he
[36:59] speaks to him and he says fear not
[37:02] so he's addressing something in
[37:04] abraham's heart he believes god but now
[37:07] he's wanting to address a need that's
[37:09] deep within his understanding deep
[37:11] within his spirit fear not abram i am
[37:14] thy shield and thy exceeding great
[37:15] reward
[37:17] he's telling him that i am your defender
[37:19] i am your cover i am your protector
[37:22] don't fear abram and look we can look
[37:25] back and see how he feared for his life
[37:26] already and and then how you know kind
[37:29] of an odd change of events and out of
[37:31] character a man who's afraid of the
[37:32] egyptians now is really ready to take
[37:34] 318 servants and run after a bunch of
[37:36] kings to rescue a servant lord and he's
[37:37] saying listen you have reason to be bold
[37:40] you have reason to be courageous i am
[37:42] your shield i am your exceeding great
[37:44] reward fear not don't be afraid
[37:49] remember in genesis 12 he was afraid for
[37:50] his life but now god is addressing the
[37:52] fear in his life but then abraham
[37:54] answers in genesis chapter 15
[37:56] what can you give me when i have no
[37:58] children
[37:59] very interesting response i'm your
[38:01] shield by exceeding great reward don't
[38:04] fear he goes but what can what what is
[38:06] it you can bless me with that's going to
[38:07] mean anything if i don't have children
[38:10] and he makes the suggestion behold i
[38:11] have a servant in my house who has a son
[38:14] maybe his son of born in my house since
[38:17] he's my servant maybe the promise is to
[38:19] him
[38:20] and god says in verse 4
[38:22] and behold the word of the lord came
[38:24] unto him saying this shall not be thy
[38:26] heir the son of your servant
[38:28] but he that shall come forth out of thy
[38:30] own bowel shall be thine air
[38:32] now god's being very precise to abraham
[38:35] more it unfolded in chapter 13. now he's
[38:37] being more precisely understands this is
[38:40] not going to be a servant this is not
[38:41] going to be a relative it's going to be
[38:42] someone that comes from your own
[38:44] body and then he wants him to understand
[38:47] once again
[38:48] how
[38:49] how big this promise is and he brought
[38:51] him forth abroad
[38:53] so there's a very
[38:54] supernatural take something supernatural
[38:57] taking place
[38:58] it says look now toward heaven
[39:00] tell the stars
[39:02] if thou shall be able to number them
[39:04] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[39:07] be
[39:08] very remarkable now don't fear abram i
[39:11] am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[39:12] reward well what is it you can give me
[39:14] when i don't even have a child maybe
[39:15] ellie's your son maybe he's the one that
[39:17] the blessing is going to come through he
[39:18] says no it can be a child from your own
[39:20] body
[39:21] listen to that a child from your own
[39:23] body
[39:24] is going to be your heir and he says
[39:26] come here i want to show you something
[39:27] look at the stars
[39:29] and we can have some pretty incredible
[39:30] skies here in arizona especially if you
[39:32] get out of the city lights and i'm like
[39:34] wow count those stars so here's abram
[39:36] with no light pollution at all looking
[39:37] up the stars he says count him
[39:39] and he's kind of like he realizes this
[39:42] is rhetorical i mean abraham would want
[39:43] to obey god he's like you're joking
[39:45] right i don't literally have to count
[39:47] the stars but he says you can't even
[39:48] count them
[39:49] so this is how your seeds going to be
[39:51] seed from your own body
[39:53] your own child your own progeny your own
[39:55] offspring
[39:57] and it says in verse six now as as
[40:01] hard as it would be for him to believe
[40:02] with the wife who is barren and his own
[40:05] body at that point him not knowing if he
[40:06] could bring four children to look at the
[40:08] stars and like yep that's how my seed's
[40:10] going to be
[40:11] you know what the next verse says he
[40:12] believed god
[40:15] and he believed in the lord
[40:18] and then he i capitalized it in my notes
[40:20] but in the in the scriptures it's not
[40:21] necessary capitalized but he god counted
[40:24] it to him for righteousness
[40:26] that abraham was standing there that
[40:28] night outside the tent
[40:29] looking at the stars with god what a
[40:31] beautiful scene
[40:33] believed him
[40:34] and thought yeah
[40:36] my seed gonna be numbered like this he
[40:39] just believed him he's like i believe
[40:41] you god and god saw that faith and
[40:44] attributed righteousness to him
[40:46] because they're standing out with there
[40:47] without a child
[40:50] he believed
[40:52] in genesis chapter 17 god appears to him
[40:54] again
[40:56] reaffirms the promise to him
[40:58] further unfolds the promise and gets
[41:00] into more detail we kind of skip over
[41:02] verse 16 where hagar is given to abram
[41:05] i'm just kind of looking at these many
[41:06] different events that take place genesis
[41:08] chapter 16 is hagar and the birth of
[41:09] ishmael chapter 17 god appears he's
[41:12] reaffirming the promise to him then more
[41:13] details are given in the promise he
[41:16] changes his name
[41:17] from abram to abraham
[41:19] and then he specifies in chapter 17
[41:22] that sarah he changes her name to sarai
[41:24] to sarah and then he promises the son
[41:27] specifically through sarah
[41:29] because now he's saying it's not only
[41:31] your body but it's not going to be
[41:33] through hagar it's not just your from
[41:35] your bowels alone but your bowels with
[41:37] sarah's womb
[41:39] so he's not being more precise it's got
[41:41] to be from her womb and so he's
[41:42] confirming the promise and he gives a
[41:44] name to the child
[41:46] sarah your wife is going to bear a son
[41:48] and his name is going to be isaac
[41:50] more specific promises are given
[41:53] genesis 18
[41:55] god veils himself and flesh again to
[41:56] visit abraham confirms the promise again
[41:59] and what vows to return these are the
[42:02] things that happen over a nearly 25-year
[42:04] period from the time that abraham lied
[42:06] down in egypt
[42:08] to where he is in genesis chapter 18
[42:10] genesis chapter 19 gets into more the
[42:12] details of the angels visiting lot and
[42:14] the
[42:15] the destruction of sodom and gomorrah
[42:18] and the birth of lot's children
[42:20] then verse 20. it kind of seems to be
[42:22] taking place at about the same time that
[42:25] uh uh sodom and gomorrah are burned but
[42:28] now let's look at chapter 20 genesis
[42:29] chapter 20
[42:31] verses 1 to 11.
[42:33] and i'm just going to i'm going to read
[42:34] through this as you would just read in
[42:36] your bible
[42:37] and i want you to recognize what's
[42:39] transpiring again
[42:40] and abraham journeyed
[42:42] from fence toward the south country
[42:45] and dwell between cadis and shear and
[42:47] sojourned in gerrard this is a
[42:48] philistine land a philistine holdout
[42:51] it's closer to egypt
[42:53] and abraham said of his sarah his wife
[42:57] she is my sister
[43:00] here he goes again
[43:02] she is my sister
[43:05] and abimelech king of gerard sent and
[43:07] took sarah but god came to abimelech in
[43:09] a dream by night and said and behold
[43:11] thou art but a dead man
[43:13] for the woman which thou has taken for
[43:15] she is a man's wife but abimelech had
[43:17] not come near her this is abraham's
[43:20] deceived abimelech
[43:21] because he there's some sort of inquiry
[43:23] who's this beautiful woman he's like uh
[43:25] my sister
[43:26] once again
[43:28] take her not me right here she is it
[43:31] says she this is my sister lord he goes
[43:34] lord will thou slay also a righteous
[43:36] nation
[43:37] said he not unto me she is my sister she
[43:40] even herself said he is my brother they
[43:42] had rehearsed this years before right
[43:44] and in the integrity of my heart and my
[43:46] innocence of my hands have i done this
[43:48] and god said unto him in a dream yay i
[43:51] know that thou didst this in the
[43:52] integrity of thy heart for i also
[43:54] withheld thee from sinning against me
[43:56] therefore suffered i thee not to touch
[43:58] her now therefore restore the man his
[44:01] wife i i love this
[44:04] he's just found out he's been deceived
[44:05] by this man and he says for he is a
[44:07] prophet
[44:10] and he shall pray for thee
[44:13] and thou shalt live you know the guy
[44:15] that lied you and put your life in
[44:16] danger and i told you you're going to be
[44:17] a dead man because you took a man's wife
[44:18] because he told you it was his sister
[44:20] yeah that guy
[44:21] i want him to pray for you
[44:24] and if thou
[44:25] restore her not know that thou shalt
[44:27] surely die thou and all that are thine
[44:30] so to have her his wife meant death for
[44:32] him
[44:33] but he says he's a prophet this is very
[44:35] important for us to recognize that god
[44:37] is recognizing abram as a prophet he
[44:39] begins to establish
[44:40] even how god further unfolds how god
[44:42] deals with his prophets he already
[44:43] disclosed things before him to him in
[44:45] genesis 18 how can i withhold this from
[44:47] my servant so he does operate in this
[44:49] office of a prophet and he says have him
[44:52] pray for you that you live even though
[44:53] he made a mistake it didn't validate the
[44:56] fact that he was a prophet
[44:58] didn't validate the fact that it would
[44:59] be his prayer that would rescue him and
[45:00] cause him to live
[45:02] because make him pray and thou shalt
[45:03] live therefore abimelech rose early in
[45:05] the morning and called all his servants
[45:07] and told all these things in their ears
[45:08] and the men were so afraid
[45:10] then abimelech called abraham and said
[45:12] unto him what has thou done unto us and
[45:15] what have i offended thee that thou has
[45:17] brought on me in my kingdom a great sin
[45:20] thou hast done deeds upon me that ought
[45:22] not to have been done
[45:24] and abimelech said to abraham what
[45:26] sayest thou that thou hast done this
[45:28] thing no i want you to catch again
[45:29] abraham's logic
[45:31] abraham said because i thought surely
[45:34] the fear of god is not in this place and
[45:36] they will slay me for my wife's sake
[45:39] did you catch it
[45:41] still afraid of death
[45:44] 25 years later
[45:45] he takes his wife
[45:48] who god has said will be her womb that
[45:50] brings forth the son from your bowels
[45:53] and here he finds himself in garrar and
[45:55] he says this is abraham justifying why
[45:58] he lied i thought that you guys didn't
[46:01] fear god and i was certain that you
[46:04] would kill me to take my wife
[46:07] still afraid of death
[46:09] still having to lie to preserve his own
[46:10] flesh and save his soul and then he says
[46:13] and yet indeed she is my sister
[46:15] a little bit of a half truth she's the
[46:17] daughter of my father but not the
[46:18] daughter of my mother and she became my
[46:20] wife sounds like a riddle
[46:23] and this is this is his justification
[46:27] and
[46:28] it continues
[46:30] there's there's more to this story how
[46:32] abimelech then blesses abraham and
[46:34] restores to him sarah's wife
[46:39] but i want you just to recognize this
[46:44] that abraham
[46:46] is still afraid of death
[46:49] and him being afraid of death i i hope
[46:51] that you can catch this part
[46:54] his actions and his words aren't fully
[46:57] lining up with the promise
[47:00] can we accept that
[47:01] and i'll say this one if it's just so
[47:03] simple that you don't feel like it
[47:04] deserves an amen for my sake amen it if
[47:06] you believe it
[47:07] here he is
[47:09] worried about death in gerar just like
[47:11] he was 25 years earlier nearly 25 years
[47:14] earlier in egypt
[47:16] he's like you're a beautiful woman
[47:18] they're going to kill me to get you and
[47:20] he's verbalizing this and justifying his
[47:23] actions and i want us to recognize that
[47:25] what he's saying and what he's doing
[47:27] doesn't mix and doesn't jail and doesn't
[47:30] harmonize with the word god spoke to him
[47:34] and listen how brother branham
[47:36] characterizes i'm just just using one
[47:38] place and christ revealed in his own
[47:39] word abraham because he's talking about
[47:41] how perfect the bible is
[47:44] and how it's a book of god not man
[47:46] because he said if man wrote it he would
[47:47] never record his mistakes
[47:50] hey and it's true you might notice that
[47:53] whenever
[47:54] whenever i read a quote and i'm reading
[47:56] it here and you're reading it there and
[47:58] there can be a the wrong verb or the
[48:00] wrong word or wrong conjugation there
[48:02] might be some stuttering in there and
[48:03] i'll skip right over it and i'll say it
[48:05] just the way that might make more sense
[48:07] if he he says uh
[48:08] uh if he says r instead of is i might
[48:11] read it the way that i would
[48:12] grammatically say it why because that's
[48:13] just me and my human nature wanting to
[48:15] correct something that maybe is not
[48:16] grammatically correct but we know that
[48:18] god is not afraid to record the mistakes
[48:21] of man
[48:23] man wants to come back and revise and
[48:25] change things and mix things up and try
[48:26] to polish things over he says if man was
[48:29] the one responsible for writing the book
[48:30] you wouldn't know one mistake of the
[48:32] prophets
[48:34] because that's the carnal side of man i
[48:36] don't make any mistakes i never make any
[48:37] mistakes there's never anything wrong
[48:38] everything's perfect everything's less
[48:40] than the lord and god's like you know
[48:41] what i'm going to preserve it so
[48:42] precisely and so specifically so that
[48:44] you know the difference between man and
[48:46] god
[48:48] god don't make mistakes
[48:51] he says do you think
[48:52] he says abraham for instance he's called
[48:54] the father of the faithful
[48:56] do you think abraham would have wrote
[48:57] the book on himself of his own
[48:59] cowardness
[49:00] cowardliness
[49:02] how do you think he would have wrote
[49:04] that he lied to the king that morning
[49:06] and said that it was his sister when it
[49:08] was his wife
[49:09] it's a lie nonetheless even though it
[49:11] was a half truth she is my sister but
[49:12] not not of my mother but of my father
[49:15] but she is my wife
[49:16] he's trying to you know there's a half
[49:18] truth but he's spoken with the intent to
[49:20] deceive
[49:22] and he says would it write of his
[49:24] cowardly deeds that he's done that he
[49:26] done surely he'd never done that
[49:28] so notice in this one place this
[49:30] characterization of cowardliness lying
[49:32] to the king and cowardly deeds
[49:35] and these his cowardly deeds in his
[49:37] lines signified that although he
[49:40] believed there was still a greater depth
[49:42] of understanding that he could have
[49:44] according about the promise
[49:46] can you can you ponder that for a moment
[49:48] just let this this is the simple thought
[49:50] that i'm wanting to get across to you
[49:51] the in the time that god called abram
[49:53] out of er his understanding had deepened
[49:56] the details to the promise had further
[49:58] unfold god had appeared to him a number
[50:00] of times god had confirmed his promise
[50:03] got more precise through your own bowels
[50:05] not your servants through your own wife
[50:06] not somebody else this is your son and
[50:08] this is going to be his name and your
[50:10] seed is going to be like the stars of
[50:11] the heaven and this is going to be the
[50:13] land they're going to live in and
[50:14] abraham had all these promises and
[50:16] abraham believed god
[50:21] but yet still we can see that in his
[50:23] life there still was a greater depth of
[50:25] understanding what he believed that he
[50:27] could achieve
[50:32] his revelation
[50:36] of the promise
[50:40] pointed to the power of god to preserve
[50:43] life
[50:45] his revelation of the promise it was
[50:46] trending to this it was pointing to this
[50:48] at every single instance and every
[50:50] single confirmation and everything god
[50:52] was given them fear not i am thy
[50:54] protector i am that coveter cover i'm
[50:56] your defender you don't need to resort
[50:57] to other things you should be afraid of
[50:59] a famine i'll bless you you shouldn't be
[51:00] afraid of man i'll keep you and there
[51:02] was this promise that god had given him
[51:04] and everything he was speaking to him
[51:06] pointed to this promise that god was
[51:08] able to preserve life or at least raise
[51:10] it up
[51:13] as it said in genesis 15 16 and he
[51:15] believed in the lord
[51:18] and he counted it to him for
[51:19] righteousness
[51:21] but even though he believed god all
[51:22] these many years there was still a
[51:24] greater potential penetration of that
[51:26] revelation
[51:28] he believed it it was there was in his
[51:30] soul but there was still some deeper
[51:32] penetration there was a greater
[51:35] practical outworking or impact and
[51:38] sufficient impressing of that revelation
[51:41] that he could have
[51:43] i want to say i don't want to say
[51:44] anything that would belittle his
[51:45] revelation wouldn't want to say anything
[51:47] that would belittle his faith but yet
[51:49] when we see him in this circumstance
[51:51] there was still more of that faith that
[51:53] could unfold or further manifestation
[51:56] that would cement that faith and anchor
[51:58] that faith and put him in a position to
[51:59] where he could say death has no more
[52:02] hold upon me
[52:04] and this is where i want us to relate
[52:08] our faith justifies us
[52:11] our faith alone makes us righteous
[52:14] yet we can still be weak in our mind
[52:18] we can still be weak in our our spirits
[52:20] and weaken our understanding and and
[52:22] weaken our doubtings and weaken our
[52:25] and our flesh
[52:28] and when we're weak in our flesh we see
[52:29] the frailties of our physical body when
[52:31] we experience
[52:32] the uh just
[52:34] the quagmire of emotions and this
[52:36] vacillating between confidence and fear
[52:39] and uh courage and doubt and all these
[52:41] different things this weak mind this
[52:43] weakness in our mind can cause us to
[52:45] doubt and then through this weakness of
[52:47] our body or our flesh
[52:50] we can fail to conduct ourselves
[52:52] according to the word that's been
[52:53] revealed to us
[52:54] amen
[52:57] we're believers right
[52:59] we're christians we're sealed with the
[53:00] holy ghost we believe his word we
[53:01] believe his promises and we're willing
[53:03] to admit that not all the time do my
[53:05] words and my actions line up with the
[53:08] very things that i know i believe in my
[53:09] heart
[53:10] i i'm not always exhibiting the
[53:12] confidence and we have let me just i'll
[53:14] just tell them myself
[53:16] all things work together for the good
[53:18] we know this we believe this and i'm
[53:20] over here and all the time
[53:23] what's happening is everybody doing this
[53:26] how can god let this happen
[53:28] and why because
[53:31] it hasn't really fully dawned on me in
[53:33] this there's good put your shoulders
[53:35] back put your chin up
[53:37] stop complaining and whining and crying
[53:39] about all the things that are bad that
[53:40] happened how you're mistreated how this
[53:42] takes place and how that takes place you
[53:44] are promised blessing
[53:48] and those that curse you he curses so
[53:51] instead of
[53:51] all these people cursing me wait a
[53:54] minute
[53:55] he's gonna bless me
[53:57] he's made he's promised me if you have
[53:58] to at least think about the fact that
[54:00] someone who curses you is setting
[54:01] himself up for a cursing to get out of
[54:03] your e or mindset listen
[54:06] we don't always conduct i don't always
[54:08] conduct myself in such a way that
[54:10] testifies aaron believes that all things
[54:12] are working together together for the
[54:14] good aaron believes that this misdeed
[54:16] and that bad thing and this person and
[54:18] that person who did this and did that
[54:19] aaron believes that it's all part of
[54:21] god's plan to bring out the best in him
[54:23] and put him in the position that god
[54:25] wants him to be in he doesn't always
[54:27] live that way can you say a man about me
[54:31] i want a man about you necessarily you
[54:33] leave it to yourselves but i'm
[54:34] confessing this that my conduct does not
[54:37] always line up with my revelation
[54:42] but with abraham ultimately his faith
[54:44] was justified by his works
[54:47] though in this moment in genesis chapter
[54:49] 20 we're reading about him lying and
[54:51] what's the reason why did he lie because
[54:52] he was afraid he was going to die it
[54:55] ultimately his works
[54:57] justify his faith and we could say his
[54:59] faith was expressed by his works
[55:02] no it's ultimately what he said and what
[55:03] he did lined up with what god promised
[55:06] it's like it's like inside he he had
[55:09] this he had this promise that that was
[55:11] at a hundred
[55:13] and his revelation of that was just
[55:15] creeping up incrementally and then his
[55:17] conduct in his words as a revelation
[55:20] comes up it starts to
[55:22] and one day it hits to where it all
[55:24] lines up his actions line up with his
[55:27] revelation which lines up with the
[55:28] fullness of the promise and everything's
[55:30] lining up and therein is his faith made
[55:32] perfect
[55:35] and i want to look at it very quickly in
[55:36] genesis chapter 22. i'm just
[55:38] headed very closely to a close here
[55:40] verses 8 to 10
[55:42] and abraham said my son
[55:44] because isaac's going up this
[55:46] mount moriah to offer sacrifice and
[55:49] isaac knew enough to say
[55:51] dad
[55:52] what are we going to kill up there
[55:56] and instead of
[55:57] lying
[56:00] instead of resorting to his own wisdom
[56:02] he says my son god will provide himself
[56:04] a lamb for a burnt offering
[56:06] so they went both of them together
[56:08] you could even back up and say that when
[56:10] the language he used to his servants
[56:12] when he left him on the base of the
[56:13] mountain and left him to the side he
[56:14] said
[56:15] the language that implies i am the lad
[56:17] will return he's using a language very
[56:19] differently than what he is in genesis
[56:20] 12.
[56:21] using the language very differently than
[56:22] the language that we see him use in
[56:24] genesis 20.
[56:27] my son god will provide himself a lamb
[56:29] for burnt offering so they went both of
[56:30] them together and they came to the place
[56:32] which god had told them of and abraham
[56:34] built an altar there he's not
[56:36] withholding through doubt through fear
[56:38] through hesitancy
[56:40] he he he's not walking and gets up said
[56:42] silly me this isn't mount moriah it's
[56:44] the one over there let's go you know
[56:46] he's not trying to delay there's no
[56:48] delay
[56:49] he's right to the place that god told
[56:50] him to go and he builds an altar lays
[56:52] the wood in order and then he's not
[56:54] hesitating this is what needs to be done
[56:56] this is what needs to be done he's
[56:57] following through and he binds isaac his
[56:59] son lays him on the altar upon the wood
[57:01] again there's no hesitation and abraham
[57:03] stretched forth his hand and took the
[57:04] knife to slay a son
[57:08] what what what do i want you to see in
[57:09] this very image
[57:11] this abraham takes the hand back
[57:14] to slay a son he is no longer afraid of
[57:17] death
[57:19] abraham is declaring that his belief in
[57:22] the promise or we could say his actions
[57:24] are declared that his faith in the
[57:26] promise has finally imposed itself on
[57:29] his actions
[57:31] that god had made a promise he had a
[57:32] revelation but his actions always kind
[57:34] of seem to meddle in this area and
[57:37] things kind of leveled and leveled and
[57:38] leveled up a little bit but now finally
[57:40] abraham act in a way that supremely
[57:43] declared a congruency and a harmony with
[57:46] what god spoke to him in the beginning
[57:48] in other words i'm willing to slay you
[57:50] because god paid me a promise that
[57:53] through you isaac will all families in
[57:55] the earth be blessed and if he wants me
[57:57] to kill you the same god that raised up
[58:00] my body and raised up your mother's womb
[58:03] is the same god that'll keep your life
[58:05] or raise it up again and he was no
[58:07] longer afraid of death
[58:10] hallelujah look at the faith of abraham
[58:12] through these crises it comes to a place
[58:14] where his his faith imposed itself on
[58:17] his perception of reality
[58:21] wow hebrews 11 19 are counting that god
[58:23] was able to raise isaac up
[58:26] even from the dead
[58:29] this is his understanding
[58:32] can we recognize just how different his
[58:33] revelation is in genesis chapter 22 from
[58:36] his understanding in genesis 12.
[58:39] and if he's really afraid he was going
[58:40] to be killed he'd go down in egypt and
[58:41] say hey they're going to kill me
[58:43] try to take you to his wife i don't know
[58:44] how this is going to work out but i'm
[58:46] going to get raised again
[58:48] so find me i'll be outside the city i'll
[58:49] be in a grave wherever they're gonna put
[58:51] my body follow close behind
[58:53] because they're gonna want you because
[58:54] you're beautiful but god made me a
[58:55] promise honey and he's either gonna keep
[58:57] my life he's gonna raise it up
[58:59] you know what paul said that we were we
[59:01] were pressed beyond measure we were
[59:02] gonna die but we believed in the god who
[59:03] would raise the dead
[59:04] that's the faith that paul had
[59:06] that's the faith that abraham ultimately
[59:08] comes to
[59:09] because in genesis chapter 20 he's still
[59:11] lying again why he's afraid of his own
[59:13] flesh
[59:14] and he wanted his life to wife to lie in
[59:17] order to preserve his soul
[59:19] but now the very one whom is the
[59:21] embodiment of the promise he's not
[59:24] rationalizing trying to come up with a
[59:26] lie trying to come with half worship not
[59:27] trying to come up with religion religion
[59:29] trying to justify well i know that god
[59:31] said this but then and i know the bible
[59:33] says this but that i know brother
[59:34] branham said this but that but he's
[59:36] willing to just do exactly what god said
[59:38] because he was no longer afraid
[59:43] he acts in harmony with the truth of
[59:45] god's promises to him
[59:48] he acts
[59:50] in harmony with the understanding
[59:53] of god's promise to him
[59:55] is he raises that back he's a god that
[59:57] can preserve life or raise it up again
[59:59] he's a god that gave me an eternal
[1:00:01] promise this is an eternal possession
[1:00:03] he's an eternal god to you and me isaac
[1:00:05] everything that god said he believed so
[1:00:08] his actions lined up with the deeper
[1:00:10] understanding of the promise
[1:00:13] what he does on that mountain it's a
[1:00:14] manifestation of the maturing of
[1:00:16] abraham's faith
[1:00:18] it's a manifestation of a more perfect
[1:00:19] understanding where it really anchored
[1:00:21] and now he's realizing this promise i've
[1:00:24] always believed in wait a minute i
[1:00:26] believe that and if i believe that then
[1:00:28] this has to be true and this has to be
[1:00:30] true and this has to be true
[1:00:32] the faith that he comes to on top of
[1:00:34] mount moriah it's a faith that was
[1:00:35] produced by god appearing to him time
[1:00:38] and time again
[1:00:39] it's a faith that rose up within him as
[1:00:41] god time and time again confirmed his
[1:00:43] promise to him it was a faith that rose
[1:00:45] up in abraham because god fulfilled the
[1:00:47] promise that he gave him
[1:00:50] not a blind trust it wasn't just abraham
[1:00:52] got it right and god he called god's
[1:00:53] bluff but this was a process wherein
[1:00:56] abraham
[1:00:57] walked with god and things transpired
[1:01:00] and god appeared and made himself known
[1:01:02] and he confirmed the promise and
[1:01:04] fulfilled his word and it put him in a
[1:01:05] place on that mountain that day to where
[1:01:07] his actions now lined up with the
[1:01:09] revelation that lined up with the
[1:01:10] promise and therein did his faith reach
[1:01:12] its full and supreme expression because
[1:01:14] now his conduct in crisis can match the
[1:01:18] truth that was given to him
[1:01:20] it was the results of a regular routine
[1:01:22] of receiving revelation
[1:01:24] right the regular routine of receiving
[1:01:26] revelation and then the outcome things
[1:01:29] are things happen god gave me this
[1:01:31] promise god gave me the promise he was
[1:01:32] in this routine brother baby says in one
[1:01:34] place that god spoke to abraham nearly
[1:01:35] every day
[1:01:38] that's quite a statement
[1:01:41] but it means day on a daily basis
[1:01:44] there were some means by which god
[1:01:47] made himself available
[1:01:49] to abraham
[1:01:51] to make his presence felt to know that
[1:01:53] he was near you ever been in a situation
[1:01:55] where before where you're seeking an
[1:01:56] answer from god you need a very specific
[1:01:58] answer very specific answer and you want
[1:01:59] him to tell you is it true or false or
[1:02:01] is it true or false and he never gives
[1:02:02] you an answer but he just makes himself
[1:02:04] known just let you know i'm mindful of
[1:02:07] you he does things supernaturally he
[1:02:08] speaks to your issue without answering
[1:02:10] it and he's what is he doing he's
[1:02:11] declaring his presence to you he's daily
[1:02:13] wanting to speak to you and commune with
[1:02:14] you even if it doesn't seem to be
[1:02:15] answering this big huge question that
[1:02:17] you have he's wanting to confirm his
[1:02:19] presence with you
[1:02:21] why because he knows it's a process
[1:02:23] if god wanted to give you
[1:02:25] third pool squirrel speaking into
[1:02:27] existence rapturing body changing faith
[1:02:29] in manifestation on day one he could
[1:02:30] have done it
[1:02:33] the power apart from character satanic
[1:02:34] and so god says i want a process of
[1:02:37] character development i want a process
[1:02:38] of harmony communion getting to know one
[1:02:40] another god's ways are beyond our ways
[1:02:42] and he knows it's a process
[1:02:46] and when abraham offered up isaac upon
[1:02:48] the altar it was the outcome of a full
[1:02:49] trust in god
[1:02:51] and an awakened trust a fully alert
[1:02:53] revealed revelated trust it was an
[1:02:56] understanding
[1:02:58] for abraham was not willing to kill
[1:02:59] isaac because god said so but he had a
[1:03:01] revelation
[1:03:03] that god would preserve him
[1:03:11] and i want to point this out in genesis
[1:03:13] chapter 21 there was one thing that
[1:03:15] happened
[1:03:18] i think this is where we can make it
[1:03:19] relatable for us
[1:03:22] if we're just if we were a bunch of
[1:03:23] people today that answered
[1:03:26] you know a flyer that was placed under
[1:03:28] our windshield wiper at fry's we're like
[1:03:30] oh i want to go do this has anyone ever
[1:03:31] thought that
[1:03:33] oh i want to do this thanks for you know
[1:03:34] thanks for putting this on my windshield
[1:03:36] wiper i feel compelled to go get this
[1:03:39] you know
[1:03:40] eyebrow pick or you know whatever they
[1:03:42] start they're
[1:03:43] advertising on your windshield but we're
[1:03:45] not all here today because we answered
[1:03:46] some flyer
[1:03:48] or because the nigerian prince emailed
[1:03:50] all of us and promised us great wealth
[1:03:51] here today if we showed up at the hilton
[1:03:52] garden inn or free dinner you have to
[1:03:54] just listen to my seminar right
[1:03:56] take you all to lunch you just have to
[1:03:57] listen to what i have to offer you if
[1:03:59] you all sign up and get everyone give me
[1:04:00] 500 and you can go out and get find
[1:04:02] somebody else to give you 500
[1:04:04] you can be rich like me
[1:04:06] that's not why we're here
[1:04:08] that's not how we made it here
[1:04:11] how is it that we enter into this
[1:04:12] journey of faith there's something that
[1:04:13] god does it's so beautiful how abraham's
[1:04:16] journey of faith is remarkable how this
[1:04:17] invisible god is making him these
[1:04:19] promises but there's something more
[1:04:22] firm in the promise that he makes to us
[1:04:23] there's something more complete and how
[1:04:25] he wants to deal with us that we have
[1:04:27] the benefit of abraham's example and we
[1:04:30] have the benefit of the seed promised to
[1:04:34] him
[1:04:35] because in genesis chapter 21 verses 1
[1:04:37] to 3 and the lord visited sarah
[1:04:40] as he had said now this is beautiful he
[1:04:43] doesn't ever say this before but now he
[1:04:44] visits her
[1:04:46] and the lord did unto sarah as he had
[1:04:49] spoken
[1:04:50] for sarah conceived oh it's such
[1:04:52] beautiful language such beautiful poetry
[1:04:54] god visits her as the lord said unto her
[1:04:57] and he did unto her what he said he
[1:04:59] would do for sarah conceived and bear
[1:05:02] abraham a son in his old age when at the
[1:05:06] set time of which god had spoken to him
[1:05:09] everything's lined up i will return
[1:05:12] according to the time of life in a
[1:05:14] specific season i will visit sarah and i
[1:05:17] will do to her what i promised to her
[1:05:19] and i will give you a son through her
[1:05:22] and his name will be isaac everything's
[1:05:24] just lining up perfectly to what he
[1:05:26] promised and it said and abraham called
[1:05:28] the name of his son that was born unto
[1:05:30] him whom sarah bore to him isaac
[1:05:34] and it may it may seem
[1:05:38] it may not you may not be able to make
[1:05:40] the connection it may just seem very
[1:05:41] obvious like well you're just reading
[1:05:42] the story brother aaron but i want you
[1:05:44] to recognize that it was this
[1:05:45] manifestation of the promise that made
[1:05:46] the difference for abraham
[1:05:49] if this part was missing and there was
[1:05:51] another visit down into egypt
[1:05:53] perhaps i know i'm speculating but
[1:05:55] perhaps abraham would still would be
[1:05:57] compelled
[1:05:58] to try to save his own skin
[1:06:01] but it was the re it was the bringing
[1:06:03] forth
[1:06:05] the manifestation of the promise this
[1:06:07] manifest manifestation of the promise in
[1:06:09] genesis 21 that makes this huge
[1:06:11] difference in abraham's walk
[1:06:14] his walking with god
[1:06:15] matured his faith
[1:06:18] little by little but then it matures it
[1:06:20] to a faith to where he was no longer
[1:06:22] afraid of death
[1:06:24] it matured his faith to a point to where
[1:06:26] he believed that even if this body is
[1:06:27] dead it still has to bring forth life
[1:06:29] even if my wife's womb is dead it still
[1:06:31] has to bring forth life and that's what
[1:06:33] the process of walking with god and the
[1:06:35] regular routine of following the plan of
[1:06:37] god and the routine of the promises that
[1:06:38] god gave him in these revelations these
[1:06:40] appearing it brought abraham to a place
[1:06:42] to where he believed that his body would
[1:06:45] bring forth a son named isaac through
[1:06:47] the womb of sarah and so he no longer
[1:06:49] regarded the deadness of his body he no
[1:06:51] longer regardless that regarding the
[1:06:53] deadness of sarah's womb and he believed
[1:06:55] in life
[1:06:58] and through his crises and through his
[1:07:00] ups and downs and his detours and
[1:07:02] everything he went through his faith was
[1:07:03] obviously growing stronger
[1:07:05] through every difficulty every strife
[1:07:07] every turn of events everything he went
[1:07:09] through even these detours into egypt
[1:07:11] and then later into gerard he his faith
[1:07:13] was growing stronger so he finally came
[1:07:15] to a place where he could believe for a
[1:07:17] son and then his faith rises to a place
[1:07:20] to now whereas he was afraid of his own
[1:07:22] death earlier and try to save his life
[1:07:24] and his wife's life now he wasn't afraid
[1:07:26] of death anymore
[1:07:28] the bible says in romans chapter 4
[1:07:30] verses 19 to 21 and being not weak in
[1:07:33] faith
[1:07:36] the weak in the flesh
[1:07:39] being not weak in faith he considered
[1:07:41] not his own body now dead
[1:07:44] when he was about 100 years old so this
[1:07:45] is where he comes to this understanding
[1:07:47] my body is dead as it is at hundred
[1:07:50] about a hundred years old
[1:07:52] my my faith has come to this place to
[1:07:53] believe for this son
[1:07:56] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:07:58] and you know what
[1:07:59] i believe that she can have a child he
[1:08:01] he obviously had a child with hagar
[1:08:03] right hey you know it's not i'm not the
[1:08:05] problem
[1:08:06] but here still as many years pass later
[1:08:09] on he still comes to this place
[1:08:12] where he believes
[1:08:14] and notice this tremendous
[1:08:16] memorialization of his faith he
[1:08:17] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:08:19] through unbelief
[1:08:21] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:08:24] through unbelief if we're to
[1:08:26] if we were to characterize abraham as
[1:08:28] staggering he didn't stagger through
[1:08:29] unbelief
[1:08:30] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[1:08:32] god
[1:08:34] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:08:36] had promised he was able to perform
[1:08:40] being not weak in faith though he might
[1:08:42] have been weak in his flesh and even in
[1:08:43] his emotions his faith what the bible
[1:08:45] said his faith ultimately prevailed
[1:08:48] under the strain of the final crisis
[1:08:50] under the strain of the nearness now the
[1:08:52] imminence i'm going to visit you
[1:08:53] according to the time of life and this
[1:08:54] time of next year you're going to have a
[1:08:56] son under the strain of this crisis he
[1:08:58] did not succumb but in faith rose above
[1:09:00] it
[1:09:02] even as he came to offer up isaac upon
[1:09:04] the altar and he reckoned that god was
[1:09:06] able to raise him up even in that moment
[1:09:08] he he he his faith rose to the challenge
[1:09:12] but even to have a son he refused to
[1:09:14] consider his physical weaknesses his
[1:09:17] physical deficiencies his physical
[1:09:18] disabilities
[1:09:20] which really in reality made god's
[1:09:22] promises impossible
[1:09:24] okay god said that i am going to have a
[1:09:27] son through sarah and her womb is dead
[1:09:29] and my body is now old
[1:09:31] and physically it was impossible but he
[1:09:33] didn't he looked at the physical
[1:09:34] impossibilities and he did not allow it
[1:09:39] to diminish the power of god's promises
[1:09:45] the bible is even suggesting
[1:09:50] that he stared down these
[1:09:51] impossibilities as it were
[1:09:54] looked at the deadness of his body
[1:09:56] he looked at the deadness of sarah's
[1:09:58] womb
[1:10:00] and he looked at it and he began to
[1:10:01] weigh it a dead womb and a dead body
[1:10:04] the promise of god
[1:10:06] a dead woman a dead body the promise of
[1:10:08] god and what he did is he looked right
[1:10:10] at him and he turned away from him
[1:10:13] and chose to believe god's promise over
[1:10:16] everything else that said it was
[1:10:18] impossible
[1:10:19] he confidently decided that the word of
[1:10:22] god must stand in the face of your
[1:10:24] opposition
[1:10:26] he looked at him he didn't say oh i'm
[1:10:27] going to bury my head and say oh no no
[1:10:29] no no no no i'm not my woman's not dead
[1:10:30] this is that
[1:10:31] he looked and said you know what this
[1:10:33] may be so but god's word will stand this
[1:10:35] may be so but god's word would stand
[1:10:38] way the promise that god gave him
[1:10:40] against the flesh he confidently decides
[1:10:43] that god's word was enough
[1:10:46] and this is where i want i'll say this
[1:10:47] in closing i want us to relate to
[1:10:49] abraham a little bit more
[1:10:51] whatever our present state of whatever
[1:10:54] our present state is whatever our
[1:10:56] current weaknesses are whatever our
[1:10:58] current temptations are
[1:11:00] by faith you can rise above it
[1:11:03] doesn't mean you have to deny the
[1:11:04] weaknesses deny the temptations deny all
[1:11:06] the things that happen like oh well i
[1:11:07] really don't have a problem or this
[1:11:08] really isn't happening but you can look
[1:11:10] at them and you can wail and you can let
[1:11:11] them you can even let it sink in what it
[1:11:14] means and what its implications are and
[1:11:16] then you can say oh if this is true it
[1:11:18] means god's word will fail and then you
[1:11:20] look at god's promises you say you know
[1:11:21] what your promises never fail so in the
[1:11:24] face of opposition in the face of all
[1:11:26] these things against it i still believe
[1:11:29] and it can be said that abraham believed
[1:11:31] in the lord
[1:11:34] we do not look down at our weaknesses
[1:11:37] as abraham could have
[1:11:39] nor do we look back at our past failures
[1:11:43] as abraham could have
[1:11:45] because think about it 25 years later
[1:11:47] here he is on the door of
[1:11:49] of sarah conceiving
[1:11:51] and he could have looked back and been
[1:11:52] like
[1:11:55] such a failure
[1:11:57] i've been waiting 25 years for this son
[1:12:00] and even looked at his most recent
[1:12:02] example in egypt or in gerar
[1:12:05] i'm like why am i still lying
[1:12:08] here all these years later after god
[1:12:11] made the promise and i tried to save my
[1:12:12] own skin and all these things taken
[1:12:15] place in my life and all these times
[1:12:16] that god's confirmed it abraham didn't
[1:12:18] look down at his own body know that he
[1:12:20] looked back at his own past he just
[1:12:22] looked to the promise
[1:12:24] and he said if that's his promise this
[1:12:26] is what it means
[1:12:28] the bible says in james chapter 1 verse
[1:12:30] 12 musicians if you could come
[1:12:34] james chapter 1 verse 12 blessed is the
[1:12:36] man that endureth temptation
[1:12:41] for when he has tried
[1:12:42] this this is the language he comes to
[1:12:44] abraham in in a couple chapters
[1:12:48] but this language is very specifically
[1:12:51] applicable to abraham
[1:12:53] blessed is the man that endureth
[1:12:54] temptation remains steadfast under trial
[1:12:58] perseveres when tempted
[1:13:01] blessed is the man that endure
[1:13:02] temptation for when he has tried he
[1:13:04] shall receive the crown of life
[1:13:06] which the lord hath promised to them
[1:13:08] that love him
[1:13:11] think about this
[1:13:13] not not just a promise of eternal life
[1:13:16] but a crowning
[1:13:18] of it
[1:13:20] the climax of it
[1:13:22] a coronation of it
[1:13:24] that if if unbelief and sin can
[1:13:28] can have a process where it it it's
[1:13:31] received it conceives and ultimately
[1:13:32] brings forth dead and it's crowned and
[1:13:34] death
[1:13:36] then the life that we've received by
[1:13:38] faith
[1:13:39] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:41] which is the new birth
[1:13:42] he's saying blessed is the man abraham i
[1:13:45] will bless you
[1:13:48] he didn't say he wouldn't try him but he
[1:13:49] said he'd bless them
[1:13:51] and abraham's blessing
[1:13:54] he received as he endured trials
[1:13:57] and in the end his testimony was crowned
[1:14:01] because if he was
[1:14:02] went back in the tent
[1:14:05] there in genesis chapter 15 and he went
[1:14:07] back in the tent and he laid down and
[1:14:09] sarah said honey what was that he goes
[1:14:11] there you see those stars
[1:14:14] that's how many children we're going to
[1:14:16] have in our family in our nation
[1:14:18] try to count them
[1:14:20] and she's like
[1:14:22] how
[1:14:23] he's like no really going to be that way
[1:14:28] baby told lot lot you go ahead you've
[1:14:30] got children now mine are coming
[1:14:33] but you go ahead and pick since you have
[1:14:34] children now but mine are coming maybe
[1:14:35] testified his whole life this is what
[1:14:37] the truth is this is the truth this is
[1:14:38] the truth and maybe he felt really
[1:14:40] really
[1:14:41] discouraged as he left guerrero again
[1:14:44] like man i just
[1:14:47] when's it going to happen when's it
[1:14:48] going to happen and there was another
[1:14:49] visitation
[1:14:52] when god visited abraham
[1:14:54] and he crowned his faith
[1:14:57] with life
[1:14:59] it was the promised son
[1:15:02] and when the promised son was born
[1:15:04] when the promised son came into that it
[1:15:06] changed something in abraham
[1:15:09] because now
[1:15:10] the promise that god had pro the promise
[1:15:13] he made and how it unfolded that sarah
[1:15:16] will have a son named isaac now he held
[1:15:19] him
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:22] and it was the personal revelation of
[1:15:23] the promised son
[1:15:25] that made all the difference in genesis
[1:15:27] chapter 22
[1:15:29] because now he knows the son
[1:15:31] now he knows the promise
[1:15:33] and because he knows the promise and he
[1:15:34] knows the son he's not afraid of death
[1:15:37] not even the death of the son
[1:15:40] right because isn't that revelation we
[1:15:41] get of jesus christ
[1:15:43] that he was he was a sacrifice to be
[1:15:45] offered he was to die but it wasn't just
[1:15:47] a promise of death it was a promise that
[1:15:48] he'd be raised up again
[1:15:51] and therefore for us those of us who
[1:15:53] have a longing for god those of us who
[1:15:56] loved him love him we've been promised a
[1:15:58] crown of life how in do we have this
[1:16:01] promise to be crowned with life how is
[1:16:03] it that we have heirs in life it is
[1:16:05] through jesus christ and it's through
[1:16:07] the prayers personal revelation of the
[1:16:09] promised son if that revelation that
[1:16:12] gives wings to our faith
[1:16:14] and that's why in the end time there is
[1:16:16] a revelation of jesus christ that comes
[1:16:19] to his elect because that's what abraham
[1:16:21] needed to have belief that death was
[1:16:24] powerless in a time of trouble and
[1:16:26] that's what we needed to believe that
[1:16:28] death is powerless in a time of trouble
[1:16:32] and this is a lesson that we learned
[1:16:34] from abraham
[1:16:36] fear not
[1:16:38] and there was this outworking in this
[1:16:40] process in his life that brought him to
[1:16:41] a place to trust god
[1:16:43] and to believe
[1:16:45] all things were possible
[1:16:46] could we stand together today
[1:16:49] the bible says i can do all things
[1:16:51] through christ
[1:16:52] which strengtheneth me
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:59] who will deliver me from the body of
[1:17:00] this death
[1:17:02] i thank god that he will
[1:17:05] through jesus christ
[1:17:07] our lord
[1:17:09] it's through him
[1:17:12] and
[1:17:15] isaac being the embodiment of that
[1:17:17] promise and a further unfolding
[1:17:18] manifestation of the promise that god
[1:17:20] had given abraham even though he only
[1:17:22] had a son
[1:17:24] and even though he he wasn't beginning
[1:17:26] to number the stars and see this great
[1:17:28] nation unfold around him it was enough
[1:17:31] to change it for him
[1:17:33] he wasn't still fretting and still
[1:17:35] worried he said well i i i god how could
[1:17:37] i offer isaac upon the altar he's not
[1:17:38] even married yet doesn't have any
[1:17:39] children can we wait until he least has
[1:17:41] a couple sons so at least we know that
[1:17:42] he has sons that can continue the
[1:17:44] lineage nope
[1:17:46] wasn't afraid anymore
[1:17:48] he wasn't looking to how he can
[1:17:49] naturally
[1:17:50] button things up and fix things and well
[1:17:52] if isaac dies now it's going to be too
[1:17:54] late and i need to lie to preserve my
[1:17:56] own soul and he tries to wiggle the way
[1:17:57] out of it it was enough
[1:18:00] and i want you to know today the
[1:18:01] personal revelation of jesus christ to
[1:18:03] you is enough
[1:18:06] we just need that to
[1:18:07] mature
[1:18:09] and to grow
[1:18:11] he is enough do you believe he's enough
[1:18:13] i know there's a
[1:18:15] there's a way that satan tries to take
[1:18:17] the word of god and
[1:18:18] and manipulate you with you we
[1:18:20] manipulate you with it
[1:18:24] and use it just enough to we always feel
[1:18:26] compromised we always feel weak and we
[1:18:28] always feel needy and it's kind of used
[1:18:30] like we're always chasing something that
[1:18:32] it's never going to come
[1:18:34] and so we always feel like we're in
[1:18:35] egypt trying to preserve our own souls
[1:18:37] we always feel like we're in gerar in
[1:18:38] the land of the philistines trying to
[1:18:40] preserve our own lives and there's
[1:18:41] always this kind of this carrot that's
[1:18:42] dangled out before us well you're not
[1:18:44] quite there yet you're not quite there
[1:18:45] yet you need you need this you need that
[1:18:47] and listen i believe that god wants you
[1:18:50] as an individual bride member to have
[1:18:52] confidence in his promise to you alone
[1:18:57] that he made the promise to you and you
[1:18:59] believe that he's able to keep it
[1:19:04] and walk with him in that promise
[1:19:07] believe i can do all things through
[1:19:09] christ who gives me strength
[1:19:11] i can do this
[1:19:12] through christ
[1:19:14] and that we have our own genesis 21
[1:19:16] experience
[1:19:17] where christ is made alive to us
[1:19:20] you realize in type that's the season
[1:19:22] we're living in now where the full word
[1:19:24] is being born into manifestation again
[1:19:26] as jesus christ was the manifestation of
[1:19:28] the promise given to abraham because
[1:19:30] when he said these seed he spoke of
[1:19:31] christ not even isaac and so it was born
[1:19:34] into manifestation of days of jesus
[1:19:36] christ and now the full word is being
[1:19:38] born into manifestation again we're
[1:19:40] living in a season for the gentile bride
[1:19:43] as it did for israel in her day when
[1:19:45] christ came that time that's the season
[1:19:47] we're living in so we ought to have a
[1:19:49] mount moriah faith to believe that god
[1:19:52] made a promise and he's able to keep it
[1:19:54] and i'm no longer afraid of what man can
[1:19:57] do to me
[1:19:58] i'm not afraid of the grave i'm not
[1:20:00] afraid of death i'm not afraid of what
[1:20:01] man can do unto me but i've got
[1:20:03] confidence in god's promises because he
[1:20:05] said this and if he said that it means
[1:20:08] this
[1:20:10] i'm willing to look at whatever staring
[1:20:11] me in the face and say oh okay yeah that
[1:20:13] doesn't look good but this looks really
[1:20:15] good
[1:20:16] and i'm sorry you're terrible and you're
[1:20:18] awful and you're really really loud and
[1:20:20] you're really really scary but you know
[1:20:21] what i'm just gonna take this instead
[1:20:23] i'm just gonna listen i'm sorry i'm just
[1:20:25] gonna take this all right now you can
[1:20:26] stay there that's fine but i'm gonna i'm
[1:20:29] over here
[1:20:30] and i'm turning my eyes on jesus
[1:20:33] and whenever you remind me this i don't
[1:20:35] know if you recognize greater is he that
[1:20:36] is in me
[1:20:38] than you
[1:20:39] no matter how big and bad you are no
[1:20:40] matter if you literally speak
[1:20:43] scientifically speak to the
[1:20:44] impossibility of me being able to have a
[1:20:46] son god said i'd have one
[1:20:49] and there i stake my my soul
[1:20:52] let's bow our heads today
[1:20:54] i feel a a a large faith bank that's
[1:20:57] built up
[1:20:59] you have a need in your life right now
[1:21:00] you want to take god at his word
[1:21:02] you know the need in your life take them
[1:21:04] right now claim it claim a promise you
[1:21:05] are the seed of abraham
[1:21:07] and you have a right to possess the
[1:21:09] gates of your enemy
[1:21:10] and you have a right right now if it's a
[1:21:13] loved one if it's a if it's a
[1:21:14] relationship if it's a promise whatever
[1:21:16] it might be you've got a promise from
[1:21:18] god you've got a word on it you've got a
[1:21:19] scripture you have every right to stand
[1:21:21] there just as bold as abraham did on
[1:21:23] mount moriah and draw that arm of faith
[1:21:26] back and believe god you said
[1:21:29] and regardless of the deadness
[1:21:30] regardless of the circumstances
[1:21:32] regardless of the symptoms
[1:21:34] the facts and figures
[1:21:39] god is able
[1:21:41] do you believe he's able
[1:21:43] the bible says that abraham believed in
[1:21:46] the lord i asked you today i'm not
[1:21:48] asking you to believe in
[1:21:50] and politics and believe in this person
[1:21:52] and that person and this minister and
[1:21:54] that this movement do you believe in the
[1:21:56] lord
[1:21:58] then take him at his word today
[1:22:00] heavenly father we stand in your
[1:22:01] presence today in all of you
[1:22:04] we sense your nearness we know that
[1:22:06] you're here
[1:22:07] and i've asked the people to respond in
[1:22:09] faith to the word by claiming a promise
[1:22:13] and i believe that if it relates to a
[1:22:14] husband or a wife physical body the
[1:22:17] deadness of a womb if it relates to
[1:22:18] healing
[1:22:20] if it relates to emotional difficulties
[1:22:22] a chemical imbalance if it relates to
[1:22:24] eyesight or
[1:22:25] foot pain if it relates to internal
[1:22:28] organs if it has to do with estrangement
[1:22:30] and the family if it has to do with
[1:22:31] financial hardships or direction that
[1:22:33] one must go or selling a house or making
[1:22:36] a mortgage payment whatever it might be
[1:22:38] i pray that you
[1:22:40] as you visited abraham in chapter 12 and
[1:22:43] chapter 13 and chapter 15 and 17 and 18
[1:22:46] and lord you visited him time and time
[1:22:49] and time again
[1:22:51] would you visit us once more
[1:22:55] and give us
[1:22:57] give us another appearing lord
[1:23:00] to strengthen our faith
[1:23:03] lord as we look at it in type how that
[1:23:05] abraham received a revelation of the son
[1:23:10] lord i pray that there would not be one
[1:23:12] person here whether it be in my own
[1:23:14] family i have a son 13 years old lord i
[1:23:17] have a daughter that's been baptized i
[1:23:18] know there's other young people here
[1:23:19] who've been baptized and i know there's
[1:23:22] family situations and
[1:23:24] new christians here lord may not one of
[1:23:26] us be outside that that personal
[1:23:28] experience of the new birth
[1:23:30] it makes all the difference lord
[1:23:34] may that be our portion to even receive
[1:23:35] it and accept it today
[1:23:37] lord it's part of lot's character to go
[1:23:40] after family that's lost
[1:23:42] it's not part of lot's character to
[1:23:43] plead for the souls that are lost
[1:23:46] lord may we have a faith that begins to
[1:23:48] achieve these levels and these
[1:23:49] benchmarks to believe all things are
[1:23:50] possible to believe for salvation of
[1:23:52] souls
[1:23:54] to even believe
[1:23:55] in the healing of our body
[1:23:58] and lord i pray today that his hands are
[1:24:00] lifted up identifying particular needs
[1:24:02] in the flesh may you now father confirm
[1:24:05] your promise to the seed of abraham
[1:24:07] and bring it to pass
[1:24:10] lord may we take this lesson from
[1:24:11] abraham and may his faith become even
[1:24:14] more relatable relatable in the sense
[1:24:16] that we're not bringing abraham's faith
[1:24:18] down but relatable in the sense that we
[1:24:19] identify with his journey
[1:24:22] and then can believe that our faith too
[1:24:24] as abrahams will reach supreme faith
[1:24:27] and in crisis in the moment that we need
[1:24:30] it one day
[1:24:32] we too will be able to have a mount zion
[1:24:34] experience
[1:24:35] just as he had a mount moriah experience
[1:24:38] bless your people i pray
[1:24:40] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:24:42] amen
