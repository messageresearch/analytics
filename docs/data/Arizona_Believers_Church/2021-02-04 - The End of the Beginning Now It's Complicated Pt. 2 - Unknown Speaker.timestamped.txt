[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] amen i'm going to be reading from
[0:01] ecclesiastes chapter 2
[0:04] and i have a little bit of a lengthy
[0:06] reading because i want to come back to
[0:07] some of the verses here later on
[0:10] and do so without necessarily needing to
[0:13] read them again
[0:14] so ecclesiastes chapter 2
[0:17] verses 1 to 11. wow wonderful presence
[0:21] here tonight
[0:22] and a little bit different arrangement
[0:23] than what we were expecting
[0:25] um but i just feel that god's pleased
[0:28] with the hearts that have come and the
[0:29] openness we have to receive from him and
[0:32] uh we're gonna we're gonna have we're
[0:34] gonna let the lord have preeminence
[0:36] regardless of where we're gathered
[0:38] and so we're so happy that you've come
[0:40] tonight and you do so with such a
[0:41] a wonderful expectation that god can
[0:43] honor with this presence
[0:45] ecclesiastes chapter 2 verses
[0:48] 1 to 11 i said in my heart go to now
[0:52] i will prove thee with mirth therefore
[0:54] enjoy pleasure and behold
[0:56] this also as vanity i said of laughter
[0:59] it is mad and of mirth what do with it
[1:02] i sought in my heart to give myself unto
[1:04] wine yet acquainting my heart with
[1:05] wisdom
[1:06] and to lay hold on folly till i might
[1:08] see what was that good for the sons of
[1:10] men
[1:10] which they should do under the heaven
[1:12] all the days of their life so he's
[1:14] giving us
[1:15] what he's what he's seeking what he's
[1:16] searching he's trying to figure certain
[1:17] things out and he says i made me great
[1:19] works
[1:20] i builded me houses i planted me
[1:22] vineyards i made me gardens and orchards
[1:24] and i planted trees in them
[1:25] of all kinds of fruits i made me pools
[1:27] of water to water there with
[1:29] with the wood that bringeth forth trees
[1:31] i got me servants and maidens and had
[1:32] servants born in my house and
[1:34] also i had great possessions of great
[1:36] and small cattle above all that were in
[1:38] jerusalem before me
[1:39] i gathered me also silver and gold and a
[1:41] peculiar treasure of kings of the
[1:43] provinces
[1:44] i get the men got me i got me men
[1:46] singers
[1:47] and women singers and the delights of
[1:49] the sons of men as musical instruments
[1:51] and all that of sorts
[1:52] so i was great and increased more than
[1:54] all that were before me in jerusalem
[1:56] also my wisdom remained with me and
[1:58] whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not
[2:00] from them
[2:01] i withheld not my heart from from any
[2:03] joy from my heart rejoiced in all my
[2:05] labor and this was my portion of all my
[2:07] labor
[2:08] then i looked on all the works that my
[2:10] hands had wrought
[2:12] and on the labor that i had labored to
[2:14] do and behold
[2:15] all was vanity and vexation of spirit
[2:18] and there was no prophet
[2:19] under the sun you may be seated
[2:28] i'm continuing on the subject of in the
[2:30] beginning
[2:31] and now it's complicated and we're not
[2:34] going to have
[2:35] i apologize in advance for lacking um
[2:38] scriptures
[2:39] and quotations but with the new setup
[2:41] tonight i wasn't
[2:42] exactly sure just how much we would have
[2:44] um in terms of time to set up and also
[2:47] whether or not you'd even be able to see
[2:48] a slideshow so i didn't want to put any
[2:50] extra pressure on the brothers
[2:52] tonight by having a real extravagant
[2:54] slideshow with animations and
[2:56] multi-colored
[2:57] only to be disappointed that we couldn't
[2:59] get it working so
[3:00] if you want the notes we can always
[3:02] email them to you provide them to you if
[3:04] you'd like to have them
[3:05] but continue on the subject uh the end
[3:07] of the beginning
[3:08] which is looking at uh how we've been
[3:10] examining the first three chapters of
[3:12] genesis and a little bit into chapter
[3:15] four and looking how in the beginning
[3:17] god created a family
[3:19] and now we're looking at how they're
[3:20] transitioning from the image that god
[3:22] gave in the beginning
[3:23] to the end of that and and then it be
[3:25] that's when it gets complicated
[3:27] and so we were looking at sunday on how
[3:29] in the beginning life was simple
[3:31] and in that way it was clear it was
[3:33] easily understood
[3:35] uh god had laid everything out in a
[3:37] particular order where you could see
[3:40] even the species having their place and
[3:42] and having their order and having their
[3:44] position
[3:45] we could see how that everything had a
[3:48] particular arrangement to it and this is
[3:49] god's way this is god
[3:50] setting things in place and arranging
[3:52] different things and it was just a
[3:54] beautiful
[3:55] in its simplicity yet we know there was
[3:57] a lot of layers to it
[3:58] very intricate creation and yet life for
[4:01] adam and the woman
[4:02] was simple and but the bible even says
[4:05] the man and his wife were naked and they
[4:07] were not ashamed it was
[4:09] a the man and his wife just conveys so
[4:13] much and we can draw on a lot of the
[4:14] things that we've ministered already
[4:15] before just to try to
[4:17] capture those things in our minds but
[4:19] they're living in the garden you could
[4:20] just sum it up this way there's the man
[4:22] and his wife living by the word and that
[4:24] was it
[4:25] that was just the most simple way that
[4:27] you could put it and it was definitely
[4:29] complex
[4:30] and incomp when you speak about
[4:31] complexity it's something that requires
[4:33] a particular skill
[4:34] or a level of understanding special
[4:36] knowledge or special understanding
[4:38] so it was definitely complex but it
[4:40] wasn't complicated
[4:42] life had a lot of different things to it
[4:43] a lot of challenges uh not challenges
[4:45] but things that they were to do
[4:46] and ways that they were told uh to
[4:48] manifest the word of god
[4:50] and in doing that it was a it was
[4:52] something
[4:53] that they were tasked with doing but it
[4:55] was easy it was clear to them they
[4:56] understood their roles they understood
[4:58] what they were supposed to do
[4:59] and yes we could say it was complex but
[5:01] it wasn't complicated
[5:02] and we say complicated confusing
[5:04] difficult hard hard to even relate
[5:06] what's taking place what's up or down
[5:08] and the will of god was clearly
[5:10] expressed and it was perfectly
[5:12] understood
[5:13] and we draw that from the message of the
[5:14] hour because brother branham tells us
[5:16] and teaches us they had perfect love
[5:17] they had the perfect understanding
[5:19] of the love of god so the will of god
[5:20] was straightforward
[5:22] and it was not misleading in any way the
[5:25] will of god though we read it now and in
[5:26] some of it's in symbolic form it wasn't
[5:28] a riddle to them
[5:30] as a matter of fact i would even make
[5:32] this point that when the woman
[5:34] is having a conversation with the
[5:35] serpent there's something that's written
[5:37] that is more
[5:38] in symbolic form and representative of
[5:40] what actually happened
[5:42] but the conversation that the woman in
[5:43] the serpent may have been having may
[5:45] have been completely different
[5:46] moses is inspired to write in a way
[5:48] where the trees are symbolic the fruit
[5:50] is symbolic
[5:51] but yet they had a more perfect
[5:52] understanding of what those symbols
[5:54] meant so to them it wasn't a riddle
[5:56] she wasn't told not to eat of a tree and
[5:58] she's trying to figure out well i don't
[5:59] really see a tree what tree what fruit
[6:01] is he talking about
[6:02] it wouldn't have been something that
[6:04] would have been this mystery to her that
[6:05] would have caused her to be confused
[6:07] or misunderstand so it wasn't a riddle
[6:09] to them
[6:10] and regardless of how complex life was
[6:13] they
[6:13] adam and the woman were simple towards
[6:15] the promise
[6:17] and that they believed god's word they
[6:19] took him at his word they were trusting
[6:21] to his word
[6:21] so they were very simple in that they
[6:23] just put their faith in the promise of
[6:25] god
[6:25] they put their faith in the commandment
[6:27] of god and god had made it simple
[6:30] and that's the beauty of it god is in
[6:31] simplicity and if any time the word is
[6:34] complicated that's not god's doing
[6:36] can we agree i would even go so far as
[6:39] to say that if i preach something that's
[6:41] from the word of god
[6:42] and it's complicated that's my fault not
[6:45] the word's fault
[6:46] because the word is not complicated the
[6:48] word is sim is simple it's
[6:49] straightforward it's clear
[6:51] and god had made it simple and so he
[6:53] took the burden of complexity off the
[6:55] man and his wife
[6:56] and said i will bear the burden of
[6:57] complexity this is just simply how you
[6:59] need to walk
[7:00] this is just simply how you need to go
[7:02] just trust in me advancing in the word
[7:04] of god i've already taken care of
[7:06] everything
[7:06] i've already sown the seeds i've already
[7:08] placed everything in the way that it
[7:09] needs to be
[7:11] and so life in the garden was complex it
[7:13] had
[7:14] a different it was a very expansive
[7:17] universe it was a vast creation there
[7:19] was very intricate creatures
[7:20] there was a great plan that was to be
[7:22] fulfilled so it was very
[7:24] life in the garden had some complexities
[7:26] to it but again
[7:27] it wasn't it was simple it was a complex
[7:30] life but yet there was simplicity to it
[7:33] and brother branham called it god's
[7:34] economy of innocence
[7:36] that means innocence is there's no
[7:38] corruption it's pure
[7:39] there's freedom from evil there's
[7:41] there's no wrong mixed in with it he
[7:43] calls it god's
[7:44] economy of innocence that's a very
[7:46] interesting phrase that he uses
[7:48] and the very word economy it just means
[7:51] household management
[7:52] and that's what the words mean the the
[7:54] greek word and even in the latin and
[7:56] even in the old english it speaks of
[7:57] household management
[7:58] the arrangement or mode of operation is
[8:00] kind of how it's evolved in the way it's
[8:02] used today
[8:03] or a system of interaction and exchange
[8:06] and so regardless of what definition you
[8:08] want to use it has a beautiful meaning
[8:09] when god says
[8:10] this is the brother man says it was
[8:12] god's economy of innocence
[8:14] that it was a household management was
[8:16] managed in innocence and simplicity it
[8:18] had an arrangement and mode of operation
[8:20] which was innocence the system of
[8:22] interaction and exchange was all based
[8:24] upon innocence
[8:25] and that's how god had ordered it and
[8:26] arranged it in the beginning
[8:28] in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 3
[8:31] he says but i fearless by any means as
[8:33] the serpent beguiled eve
[8:35] through his subtlety so so your minds
[8:38] should be corrupted
[8:39] from the simplicity that is in christ
[8:42] satan had defiled
[8:43] this their singleness of mind that they
[8:45] had this
[8:46] simple faith in god's word they were
[8:48] trusting to him they were believing in
[8:50] him
[8:50] and what paul is even pointing out is
[8:52] that the serpent through his subtlety
[8:55] corrupted her simple faith in the word
[8:57] of god her simple obedience in the word
[8:59] of god regardless of what the act was
[9:01] at its most basic level the most basic
[9:04] principle
[9:04] is that she violated the word of god she
[9:06] acted in disobedience with the
[9:08] commandments she had been given
[9:09] and she was given another way to view
[9:12] the world
[9:13] because paul says just as some come
[9:15] preach another jesus or another spirit
[9:17] comes or is another gospel
[9:18] so that's basically what the serpent
[9:20] brought is she had one way of viewing
[9:22] the world she had one way of living in
[9:24] the world
[9:24] she had one way of existing it was by
[9:28] the word of god it was faith in the word
[9:30] of god
[9:30] and satan was able just to add to it in
[9:33] such a way to where it complicated
[9:35] the promise it complicated her
[9:36] understanding of the promise and that
[9:38] was the way that the word
[9:40] was was forsaken and allowed sin to
[9:43] enter in
[9:45] and paul is saying lest that same thing
[9:47] that happened to the woman he fears
[9:49] that we could also be beguiled from our
[9:51] simplicity that is in christ and again
[9:54] it's not that we have faith in a simple
[9:56] christ because the word is
[9:57] the word is uh has great depth great
[10:00] breadth to it the height the depth the
[10:01] length everything
[10:02] there's a lot of there's a lot to the
[10:04] word of god but it was being simple
[10:05] towards it
[10:06] just say i believe it i believe all of
[10:08] it i take it for exactly
[10:10] what it is and for us we're we're not
[10:13] born into an age of innocence
[10:15] that was going to be my biggest amen of
[10:17] the night so um i'm just gonna i'm just
[10:19] gonna
[10:20] kind of buckle down and get through it
[10:21] but we are not born in an age of
[10:23] innocence
[10:24] that there you go all right i might try
[10:26] that more often
[10:28] but there it's it's a time which we all
[10:30] understand and are very
[10:32] very sensitive and aware that we live in
[10:34] an evil age in a dark age
[10:36] and it's not an economy of innocence but
[10:38] it's an economy of chaos
[10:39] and it's a confusion complication is the
[10:42] word that we're wanting to use just to
[10:43] refer to it how that complexity is
[10:45] something that requires special
[10:47] knowledge or understanding or skill
[10:49] and and but yet complicated something
[10:51] that even regardless of knowledge and
[10:53] skill it's like
[10:53] this thing doesn't even make sense it's
[10:55] not these things aren't even related
[10:56] they don't even connect
[10:58] and that's kind of the world that we're
[10:59] living in now it's a it's a world that's
[11:01] lost
[11:02] all sanity it's a world where common
[11:04] sense doesn't uh
[11:06] doesn't exist anymore where people
[11:09] have these great platitudes and they
[11:10] take these positions and these stances
[11:12] and they feel that they're doing it in
[11:14] the sense of justice and fairness and
[11:16] they don't realize that
[11:17] the ver their very justification for
[11:18] their position is the exact
[11:20] same thing on the other side that they
[11:23] become
[11:24] we're against tolerance so we're going
[11:25] to intolerate people who are intolerant
[11:27] and just that principle in itself says
[11:29] well how could you
[11:30] how could you be intolerant in defense
[11:32] of tolerance
[11:34] i just kind of throwing it out there you
[11:35] chew on a little bit how could you
[11:38] how could you there's just so many
[11:40] inconsistencies i won't get in it but
[11:41] there's just a lot of things that we
[11:42] look and say well this doesn't make
[11:43] sense that doesn't make sense
[11:44] it's the world we're living in now and
[11:47] brother branham said the great burden of
[11:49] this last age is the pressure of riches
[11:52] soft living and nervous tensions in a
[11:54] complex age
[11:55] that we seem unfitted to live in this
[11:58] last age has a burden which is
[12:00] made up of pressure riches soft living
[12:02] and nervous tensions
[12:03] so we can say that this god's economy of
[12:05] innocence has been replaced by
[12:06] a complex age that even we whether he's
[12:09] talking about believers or just human
[12:11] beings we could say amen to it but
[12:13] especially believers we don't seem fit
[12:14] to live in such a godless society
[12:17] we don't seem fit to live in such a
[12:19] godless world and
[12:20] and satan's eating and all the horrible
[12:22] things that exist in this world
[12:23] it's just not it doesn't it doesn't
[12:25] thrill us it doesn't satisfy us and
[12:27] and the whole world seems to be
[12:28] uncomfortable in its existence that's
[12:30] the age that we're living in
[12:32] pressure rich is soft living and nervous
[12:34] tensions it's the anti-eden it's really
[12:38] the opposite of everything god did
[12:40] and if you could just take that
[12:41] principle and say whatever was in the
[12:43] beginning just take the opposite that's
[12:45] exactly what is now
[12:46] whatever god had accomplished whatever
[12:48] god had achieved everything was arranged
[12:49] it was all orderly there was male female
[12:51] this that and the other you just take
[12:53] the opposite now to where now
[12:54] there's not even male female now there's
[12:57] not order it's chaos it's confusion and
[12:59] that's the age that we're living it's
[13:00] the complete opposite of everything that
[13:02] god had arranged
[13:03] and established in the garden and this
[13:06] is my this is my thesis and this is my
[13:08] burden there's only one
[13:09] there's only one way to untangle all the
[13:11] confusion
[13:13] there's only one way to make sense of
[13:14] all the complications and that's the
[13:16] word of god
[13:18] and and this is impressed upon me even
[13:20] at this juncture and the things that
[13:21] we're looking at in terms of
[13:23] uh the family in relationships
[13:26] and principles that we can challenge
[13:28] ourselves by to be better brothers and
[13:29] sisters to each other within the family
[13:31] of god
[13:32] to be better husbands and to be better
[13:33] parents and to be better children
[13:35] even before we could even begin to speak
[13:38] on those principles
[13:39] i feel it is so necessary that we as a
[13:41] church are rooted and grounded in one
[13:43] thing and that's the word of god
[13:45] that our ambition and our aim isn't to
[13:47] try to figure out how to have the most
[13:49] dynamic song service or to try to figure
[13:52] out how we're going to be able to get
[13:53] the smoke machine in here and get all
[13:54] the lights to work and
[13:55] that's not our objective is to create a
[13:58] dynamic atmosphere through songs and
[14:00] through worship
[14:01] and things that kind of um scratch that
[14:03] itch of our flesh to enjoy a church
[14:05] service and maybe
[14:06] some some shouting and some dancing and
[14:08] maybe some of the chairs getting knocked
[14:09] over or whatever
[14:10] that's not what we want to be rooted and
[14:12] grounded in we want to be rooted and
[14:14] grounded in the word
[14:16] and it's when the word has preeminence
[14:17] that gifts can be manifest and
[14:20] healings can take place and we have the
[14:22] proper balance to see that those things
[14:24] are furthering us in our faith
[14:26] instead of holding us back and i believe
[14:28] it's absolutely imperative
[14:30] that we understand that our foundation
[14:32] and the basis upon which we are living
[14:34] is upon the word of god and that what we
[14:36] preach what we believe and the things
[14:38] that we live
[14:39] are things that come from the word of
[14:40] god because christ alone is the answer
[14:43] to the chaos
[14:45] the only way we're going to be able to
[14:46] untangle this ball this uh all this
[14:48] confusion the knots that are in our
[14:49] stomach the
[14:50] what we don't know about the future
[14:51] we're all worried about our past the
[14:53] only way any of that's going to make
[14:54] sense
[14:54] is through the word of god and as we
[14:57] mentioned
[14:58] it on sunday to comprehend the
[14:59] complications of this life
[15:01] i'm wanting to look at the beginning and
[15:03] i'm looking at the beginning draw this
[15:05] contrast for the way things were to the
[15:07] way things are
[15:08] now and in genesis chapter 2 i'm going
[15:10] to read three places in genesis
[15:12] 2. i'm going to read from genesis 3 and
[15:14] then and then we're going to take a step
[15:15] further in this
[15:17] but notice how god establishes the man
[15:19] in the beginning
[15:20] and this is important just to to kind of
[15:23] finish up the contrast as we were
[15:25] looking at it last week
[15:26] it says the lord god planted a garden
[15:28] eastward in 80 in eden genesis chapter 2
[15:30] verse 8. i apologize if i seem a little
[15:33] nervous tonight and i'm going too fast
[15:36] i'll learn to slow down eventually and
[15:39] says the lord god planted a garden
[15:41] eastward in eden
[15:43] and there he put the man whom he had
[15:45] formed
[15:46] so eden means pleasure eden means
[15:49] delight and this is no doubt
[15:51] a garden of pleasure to the lord but it
[15:53] is a garden of pleasure for the man
[15:56] that when god planted the garden
[15:58] eastward and even before even man was
[15:59] created god provided for him
[16:02] and we realized that this is exactly
[16:03] what brother branham teaches us about
[16:05] the future home and things that are to
[16:06] be
[16:07] that god knows you like this and god
[16:08] knows you like that and knowing that one
[16:10] day you're going to be in that land
[16:11] he's already preparing it to suit you
[16:14] that's how our heavenly father works so
[16:16] when god created
[16:17] in the beginning this garden of eden
[16:19] this garden of pleasure
[16:21] it wasn't just god's delight but it
[16:23] would be to man's delight
[16:24] he knew how he was going to make the man
[16:25] he's like this is going to make adam so
[16:27] happy
[16:28] he's going to love these trees he's
[16:29] going to love these fruits he's going to
[16:30] love these mountains he's going to love
[16:32] these rivers
[16:32] he's going to love everything about this
[16:34] creation and so adam
[16:36] identified first with all creation that
[16:38] this was something delightful or
[16:40] pleasing
[16:40] it was a place of pleasure for the man
[16:44] and then it says in verse 15 and the
[16:45] lord god took the man and put him into
[16:47] the garden of eden
[16:49] to dress it and to keep it so now not
[16:52] only is it a place of pleasure but it's
[16:53] a garden of labor
[16:55] it's a garden of work now i know you
[16:57] probably wince a little bit and go oh
[16:58] that doesn't make any sense
[17:00] but work was different then it had a
[17:03] completely different meaning to it
[17:05] and it's very hard for us to comprehend
[17:07] how that work and
[17:09] it wasn't a j-o-b if i could put it that
[17:10] way it was labor it was work but to him
[17:13] it wasn't a burden it wasn't a task it
[17:15] wasn't chores like oh
[17:16] i've got to take out the trash or oh my
[17:19] goodness i washed the dishes last week
[17:21] yeah it's a new week right i've already
[17:24] done that i've done this
[17:25] it wouldn't have been this cycle of
[17:26] every day the same old thing but he was
[17:28] put in the garden to
[17:29] labor to dress and to keep it and this
[17:31] did not
[17:32] diminish the pleasure of the garden if
[17:35] anything
[17:35] it amplified it this is a place that he
[17:38] loved and now he would have
[17:39] responsibility over and he would
[17:41] dress it and keep it and in verse 20
[17:43] verse 19 and 20
[17:44] god says that he brought all the animals
[17:46] unto adam to see what he would name and
[17:48] what he would call him and it says that
[17:50] adam gave names to all the cattle
[17:52] and to the fowl of the air and to every
[17:53] beast of the field
[17:55] so adam's labor was fruitful his labor
[17:58] invoked the exercise of distinction he
[18:00] had to
[18:01] he had to use his knowledge and his
[18:02] wisdom to name the creatures he had to
[18:04] his dominion required wisdom and so
[18:08] adam's existence in the garden was one
[18:10] of pleasure
[18:10] it was also one of labor but it was one
[18:12] in which he exercised knowledge he was
[18:14] exercising his gifts
[18:15] it was a very full life a very
[18:17] fulfilling life
[18:19] and his dwelling the entire domain the
[18:21] entire world
[18:23] was one of pleasure and the labor that
[18:26] he undertook was pleasant to him
[18:28] it was pleasing now again i realize that
[18:30] probably
[18:31] we really can't quite relate to that
[18:33] because our enjoyment comes on a pay
[18:35] period right
[18:36] every two weeks we get a paycheck or
[18:37] every week or whatever it is we get paid
[18:40] and in that one moment of that
[18:41] satisfaction of having that direct
[18:43] deposit hit
[18:44] we feel like okay well maybe it was
[18:45] worth it i'll give it another two weeks
[18:47] but adam just loved it work and labor
[18:50] and everything he was doing having
[18:52] dominion and subduing and naming and
[18:54] everything that he would have to do
[18:55] was all was pleasant and satisfying to
[18:57] him it was a garden of pleasure it was a
[18:59] garden of labor it was a garden of
[19:01] of exercising all of his gifts it was a
[19:03] beautiful beautiful thing
[19:05] but in genesis chapter 3 verses 16 to 19
[19:09] and i will just read to verse 17
[19:10] actually for time's sake and just
[19:12] amplify a couple words
[19:14] in this when it comes after the fall
[19:18] now it says unto the woman he said i
[19:19] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[19:22] conception
[19:23] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[19:24] children and then it says to adam in
[19:26] verse 17
[19:28] because he has eaten of the tree it says
[19:29] thou shalt not eat of the ground
[19:31] it is cursed cursed is the ground for
[19:34] thy sake
[19:35] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[19:38] days
[19:39] of thy life and what is he going to
[19:41] describe thorns and thistles this ground
[19:43] is going to bear unto you
[19:44] in the sweat of thy face in verse 19
[19:46] you're going to have to labor and work
[19:48] to eat bread and then it says and
[19:49] they're going to go back to the dust
[19:52] this is this this dynamic now that adam
[19:54] is working within
[19:56] is completely incongruent with what he
[19:58] was originally doing
[20:00] god is basically saying that in the
[20:02] beginning if we could put it this way in
[20:03] the beginning
[20:04] you're going to work you're going to
[20:05] have you're going to have dominion
[20:06] you're going to have to subdue
[20:08] you're going to labor but everything's
[20:09] going to be pleasant to you it's going
[20:10] to be pleasing there's going to be a
[20:11] great reward it's going to come easy
[20:13] because the way that you're gifted it's
[20:14] going to happen because of the seeds are
[20:16] already sown and god's presence has
[20:18] dominion
[20:18] and you're in the image of god and
[20:20] everything is just clicking and working
[20:21] harmoniously
[20:22] and now he's wanting him to understand
[20:24] it's going to be different now
[20:27] so he tells the woman it's going to be
[20:28] sorrow
[20:30] it's going and this sorrow even the the
[20:32] language that is used of
[20:34] sorrow the very thing is pain or labor
[20:36] or hard hardship
[20:37] it's going to be a vexation is the word
[20:39] that you use it's going to be torture
[20:41] and we can say amen because that's what
[20:44] work is now
[20:46] and he's telling them that now work is
[20:48] no longer going to be as fulfilling as
[20:49] it was before
[20:50] because now you're going to struggle
[20:51] you're going to labor and you're going
[20:52] to work because you need to eat bread to
[20:54] live
[20:54] but this labor is going to is going to
[20:56] be frustrating because you're going to
[20:58] plant seeds
[20:59] and expect those seeds to come up and
[21:00] bear to you fruit but guess what thorns
[21:02] and thistles are also going to come up
[21:04] and they're going to compete with that
[21:05] seed for the light and for the water and
[21:07] for the nutrients and it's not just
[21:08] going to be as easy as you knew it
[21:09] before
[21:11] again if we could if we could say this
[21:12] that the words that we read convey
[21:15] the things that we need to to begin to
[21:18] understand
[21:19] what was happening in this moment but
[21:21] let's just say that god by speaking to
[21:23] adam was giving him a full
[21:25] understanding of how different the
[21:27] reality would be
[21:29] in all the ways that maybe we can't
[21:30] understand that's being conveyed in
[21:32] these very verses
[21:33] adam was realizing this is going to be
[21:35] different now that's going to be
[21:36] different
[21:37] everything is turned on its head there's
[21:39] so many things that were taking place in
[21:40] that moment
[21:41] the thorns and thistles the sweat of his
[21:43] brow going back to the dust everything
[21:45] had been turned on its head
[21:47] and so this is man's departure from the
[21:50] the pleasure
[21:51] this is man's departure from the
[21:52] pleasant labor and now it's an entrance
[21:54] into a struggle
[21:56] it's entrance into confusion that every
[21:58] man entered into
[21:59] from that point on nobody's had the the
[22:02] horror of the transition that adam and
[22:04] the woman had
[22:05] to go from a perfect eden into absolute
[22:07] chaos because every man from that point
[22:09] on has been born into the chaos
[22:11] they don't know the transition but we do
[22:13] know the transition
[22:14] from being unregenerate from being
[22:16] sinful to being confused to being broken
[22:19] to being depressed
[22:20] to being sick to having god come in his
[22:22] word transform our lives
[22:23] into new creatures and all of a sudden
[22:25] everything that was chaotic everything
[22:26] that was hurtful everything that was
[22:28] bringing us down
[22:28] something changes and becoming a new
[22:30] creature in christ we experience a
[22:32] transition
[22:33] out of the confusion and chaos into a
[22:35] glorious light
[22:36] and i thank god that we can have that
[22:38] transition
[22:39] because it's a beautiful transition it's
[22:41] a glorious transition
[22:44] and so the issues of life became
[22:45] complicated
[22:47] work was full of trouble it was un fruit
[22:50] was unpredictable
[22:51] there was no way to anticipate what
[22:53] would be
[22:54] maybe there just even and how adam would
[22:57] begin to to
[22:58] wrestle with the earth and he said well
[22:59] i think this is going to work and then
[23:00] it wouldn't work and i think that maybe
[23:02] this will work and it wouldn't work
[23:03] it was not it wasn't it wasn't uh it
[23:06] wasn't the life that he lived before
[23:08] though it was complex it wasn't
[23:10] complicated now life was
[23:11] a trouble life was a burden life was a
[23:14] struggle
[23:15] in one that in the struggle all he could
[23:18] look forward to was a grave
[23:20] could you imagine that this is and this
[23:22] is how all man has lived for thousands
[23:24] of years we're going to work
[23:25] and then we're going to die
[23:28] so when we i want to turn if you could
[23:30] to ecclesiastes chapter one and i kind
[23:32] of arranged this
[23:33] so that we could go through it
[23:34] chronologically in these verses until
[23:37] we'll skip back a little bit at the end
[23:39] but i'm going to start with chapter one
[23:41] and i just want to read through um
[23:45] the book of ecclesiastes just some key
[23:47] parts i'm not going to read the whole
[23:48] thing
[23:51] so i don't want you to get too nervous
[23:53] really i wouldn't want you to get
[23:54] nervous at all but
[23:56] if you're just prone to it don't get too
[23:57] nervous
[23:59] we're just going to read little snippets
[24:00] and several chapters
[24:02] because this book and i'm sure most of
[24:04] you are familiar with it
[24:06] it is it is so it's an
[24:10] excellent summary of the vanity of life
[24:14] it's an excellent summary of the
[24:15] complications of life and the confusions
[24:17] of life
[24:18] and there's a way that you can read it
[24:19] that that speaks to the spiritual type
[24:22] and how
[24:22] there's certain things that are natural
[24:24] but then there's a spiritual side to it
[24:25] and there's things that you could see
[24:26] that approaches it from the angle this
[24:28] is what a foolish man does this is what
[24:29] a wise man does
[24:30] but i want you to look at from the
[24:32] viewpoint of the one who speaks here in
[24:33] the very beginning
[24:34] that this is him who's the wisest of all
[24:38] looking at all of life so he's a wise
[24:40] man and he's giving his assessment his
[24:42] conclusion
[24:43] about the life that you're living now so
[24:46] when i read it let's not go back
[24:47] thousands of years to the days of
[24:49] solomon or back to the old testament
[24:50] think of how
[24:51] they walked around with leather sandals
[24:53] and they wore robes and they had donkeys
[24:54] pulling carts
[24:55] think about where you're living right
[24:57] now and make the application
[25:00] of the language that's being used and it
[25:01] still 100
[25:04] diagnoses the human existence it
[25:07] summarizes the human existence i'm not
[25:08] talking about the believer's existence
[25:10] in christ
[25:10] because that hadn't been opened up yet
[25:12] and that contrast is definitely being
[25:14] pointed to but initially before we even
[25:16] come
[25:17] um to emphasize the other side to that
[25:19] ponder for a moment how
[25:21] the things he's saying here perfectly
[25:23] describes our natural existence in our
[25:25] natural life
[25:26] it says in ecclesiastes chapter one
[25:27] verse one the words of the preacher
[25:29] will read to verse three the son of
[25:32] david king
[25:32] in jerusalem they believe that this is
[25:34] to be solomon
[25:37] so when he referred to the book of
[25:38] ecclesiastes you could say this is
[25:40] solomon you could say this the preacher
[25:42] but he says vanity of vanities saith the
[25:44] preacher
[25:45] vanity of vanities this is uh this is
[25:48] kind of
[25:49] akin to this is emphasis you have the
[25:51] holy of holies
[25:53] here this would be the opposite the
[25:54] vanity of vanities if that's the most if
[25:57] the holy of holies is the most holy
[25:58] place you can't get any holier
[26:00] he's trying to use this as infinite
[26:01] emphasis this is the vanity of vanities
[26:04] vanity of vanities all is vanity
[26:07] uh what now preacher what is vanity all
[26:10] is vanity
[26:11] well what about this vanity well what
[26:12] about that vanity what about this
[26:14] vanity he's saying all his vanity what
[26:17] prophet hath the man
[26:18] of all his labor which he taketh under
[26:21] the sun
[26:22] all is vanity it's futile it's
[26:24] meaningless that's what the word means
[26:25] the meaning is it's chasing the wind
[26:28] what's gonna happen if you chase the
[26:29] wind
[26:31] nothing you're gonna get tired and
[26:34] there's
[26:34] there's no there's nothing there's
[26:36] nothing to catch there's nothing
[26:38] to harness if you chase it that's what's
[26:39] being thought here it's futile it's
[26:41] meaningless
[26:42] and it it's he says all is vanity it's
[26:45] not in
[26:45] and remember he's not describing it as
[26:48] it was in its original condition
[26:50] he's describing it in its present
[26:51] condition he's not describing
[26:54] the beginning he's describing after the
[26:56] end of the beginning he's describing his
[26:58] existence at the time
[26:59] and it applies today so he's not
[27:01] describing the original arrangement he's
[27:03] not describing
[27:04] heaven he's not describing the word of
[27:06] god he's describing the human life
[27:08] he's saying all is vanity as the bible
[27:11] says in romans 8 20 for the creature was
[27:13] made
[27:13] subject to vanity all creation was made
[27:16] subject to vanity
[27:17] all creatures were made subject to
[27:19] vanity mankind
[27:20] became subject to vanity he says vanity
[27:23] of vanities vanity of vanities all his
[27:25] vanity and he asked this question
[27:27] what prophet hath the man of all his
[27:28] labor which he taketh and this phrase
[27:30] under the sun it means all of life
[27:34] what does man really gain from all his
[27:35] work in this
[27:37] life what a question the wisest man in
[27:40] the world is asking this question
[27:42] what does a man get out of it everything
[27:44] he labors to do everything he tries to
[27:46] do everything he accumulates and the
[27:48] people he meets and the relationships he
[27:50] has
[27:50] he said at the end of the day what have
[27:51] we gotten out of it
[27:54] what does a man really gain from
[27:56] everything
[27:57] under the sun everything that is in life
[28:01] and so really the whole book examines
[28:03] this question what what is there a
[28:05] prophet to this
[28:05] is there anything that's beneficial is
[28:07] there anything we can take from this is
[28:09] there anything that takes away the
[28:10] vanity
[28:11] and that's the question he begins to
[28:13] examine now i'm going to skip across a
[28:15] lot of really really good scriptures but
[28:16] just try to find some
[28:17] real impactful condensed statements that
[28:20] this preacher makes
[28:21] to drive this point home verse 13 and i
[28:24] gave my heart to seek and search out
[28:26] wisdom
[28:26] concerning all things that are done
[28:28] under heaven so now we understand
[28:30] that this is his focus to this book i
[28:33] have
[28:34] searched out wisdom and i've sought
[28:37] these things out concerning
[28:38] everything under the sun because my
[28:40] promise is or my problem is this that
[28:42] man works and he labors and he doesn't
[28:44] get anything out of it
[28:45] so i want to look at this a little bit
[28:46] more i want to understand everything is
[28:48] vanity so i really want to dig into this
[28:50] to figure out
[28:50] am i seeing this wrong why is it vanity
[28:52] what's happening
[28:53] so he's kind of setting us up for what
[28:55] he begins to say and he says concerning
[28:57] all things that are under the
[28:58] heaven this sore travail hath god given
[29:02] to the sons of man
[29:03] to be exercised there with where did
[29:05] this sword travail come
[29:07] come from where did this sorrowful labor
[29:08] where did this burdensome
[29:10] um work come from from the when the
[29:12] beginning ended
[29:14] genesis chapter three i want to seek out
[29:16] and search out wisdom concerning this
[29:18] sword travail that god has placed upon
[29:20] the sons of man that man is exercised
[29:22] with he labors and he struggles with
[29:23] the things that he exists within i want
[29:25] to search it out and understand what's
[29:27] taking place
[29:28] verse 14 i have seen all the works that
[29:30] are done under the sun
[29:31] and behold all is vanity and vexation of
[29:35] spirit
[29:36] vanity means empty it's a vapor you
[29:39] can't grab it
[29:40] it's just a mist and vexation it speaks
[29:42] of a striving or longing in other words
[29:44] there's no satisfaction or fulfillment
[29:46] you keep striving you keep
[29:47] longing it's like having a hunger pain
[29:49] but you can't quite satisfy it
[29:52] and and maybe that's a good maybe a good
[29:54] example to use
[29:55] as there's times when we're really
[29:56] really hungry and we actually eat
[29:59] and what and what happens it doesn't hit
[30:01] the spot
[30:02] and we're left dissatisfied we're like
[30:04] man i i actually feel like i want to eat
[30:06] something else or eat something
[30:07] different
[30:08] even though you might be full you still
[30:10] feel like that i'm left completely
[30:11] unsatisfied
[30:12] i may physically have a full belly but
[30:14] there's some part of me that hasn't been
[30:15] satisfied
[30:16] and has and it hasn't been quenched do i
[30:19] mention food a lot
[30:21] i might need to eat more before i preach
[30:24] but it's a striving or a long and
[30:26] there's no contentment or satisfaction
[30:28] that comes with the labor says all is
[30:29] vanity
[30:29] not just vanity where it's empty but it
[30:31] also this is incredible
[30:33] the emptiness vexes me there's such a
[30:36] power to the
[30:37] the emptiness it's a vexation it's a
[30:39] torture it'd be one thing if there's
[30:41] something
[30:41] there was some substance would be
[30:42] another thing if there was nothing to it
[30:44] and we're just like oh well there's
[30:44] nothing
[30:45] but even the emptiness has a force and a
[30:47] way to leave us dissatisfied discontent
[30:50] and
[30:50] unhappy and now look at this this is
[30:53] incredible
[30:54] he says that which is crooked cannot be
[30:56] made straight
[30:57] and that which is wanting cannot be
[30:59] numbered he begins to point out the
[31:01] inconsistencies the anomalies we can't
[31:03] account for
[31:04] like here i am the wisest man in the
[31:06] world and and and i'm looking out and
[31:08] mankind has had these
[31:09] a few thousand years of existence four
[31:12] thousand years at least of existence
[31:13] and we've done roughly they've had all
[31:15] this time together and yet they can't
[31:17] account for certain things they can't
[31:18] figure certain things out things are
[31:20] inconsistent
[31:20] things don't seem to fit the very words
[31:23] that are used speak of defects there's
[31:25] defects and deficiencies
[31:26] we can't solve or fix all the works of
[31:29] man that he's exercised in or vanity and
[31:31] vexation
[31:32] because that which is crooked cannot be
[31:34] made straight that which is wanting
[31:35] cannot be numbered the incompleteness
[31:37] can never be remedied man has a need he
[31:41] has a longing there's things that he
[31:42] tries to accomplish things that he tries
[31:43] to do but that incompleteness
[31:45] can never be satisfied the deficiencies
[31:47] are too numerous to resolve the wanting
[31:50] cannot even be numbered
[31:53] the crooked things cannot be made
[31:54] straight
[31:57] and realize that what he's talking about
[31:58] there it speaks of things that don't
[32:00] make sense
[32:01] things that aren't level not even the
[32:03] natural things but the things
[32:04] that they cannot seem to make sense of
[32:08] the things that seem incongruent
[32:10] contradictions maybe is a good word of
[32:12] thinking about it the these are things
[32:14] that man wrestles with and tries to
[32:16] figure out the paradoxes
[32:19] those are the things he's wanting us to
[32:20] ponder and begin to think about and
[32:22] remember that meaning when you read
[32:23] about
[32:24] john the baptist and the coming of the
[32:25] messiah when it speaks about the crooked
[32:26] being made straight
[32:28] and things being leveled out it's the
[32:30] resolution to man's paradox
[32:32] it's the resolution to man's struggle
[32:34] it's the resolution demands confusion
[32:38] and so now if you look at chapter two in
[32:41] ecclesiastes chapter two in the several
[32:43] verses that we read at the beginning
[32:45] solomon again begins to describe his
[32:47] efforts to satisfy himself
[32:50] and and to give life fulfilling purpose
[32:53] because he's kind of set us up in
[32:54] chapter one saying
[32:55] the sword travail that man is exercising
[32:57] it's all vanity it's vexation of spirit
[32:59] these things that seem incongruent
[33:01] inconsistent all these contradictions
[33:02] how can we make sense of it
[33:04] so now chapter two is almost uh
[33:06] solomon's attempt to try to make sense
[33:08] or find the prophet
[33:11] the benefit he's trying to find the
[33:12] wisdom he's trying to he's trying to
[33:14] prove that he can be happy and find
[33:16] mirth and he says i said in my heart
[33:18] go to now i will prove thee with mirth
[33:20] therefore
[33:21] enjoy pleasure and behold this
[33:24] is also vanity i'm just going to make
[33:27] myself happy as much as i can i'm going
[33:28] to really
[33:29] make joy the principal thing and my
[33:31] physical sensation of being happy and
[33:32] being fulfilled
[33:33] and making this flesh feel sensi uh
[33:35] sensitized he says i'm going to do that
[33:37] i'm going to enjoy
[33:38] pleasure but this was vanity and in
[33:40] verses 2 to 8 let me summarize it to you
[33:42] this way
[33:43] he begins to say i enjoyed wine he found
[33:46] intoxicating substances
[33:48] he built houses he planted vent gardens
[33:50] he he
[33:51] planted vineyards he planted orchards he
[33:53] planted trees of all various kinds of
[33:55] fruit
[33:56] he made pools he obtained servants and
[33:58] maidens he had great possessions of
[34:00] cattle
[34:00] he gathered silver gold unique treasures
[34:02] he had the best antique collection
[34:07] then he got singers and musical
[34:08] instruments he had entertainers
[34:10] i mean he's really destroyed describing
[34:12] the life
[34:14] so he has wine he built a nice house the
[34:16] house had a garden the house didn't have
[34:17] just a garden it had a vineyard it did
[34:19] just have a vineyard that had an orchard
[34:20] and it didn't just have one tree in the
[34:21] orchard had many different trees of many
[34:23] different fruits
[34:24] and it also had a swimming pool
[34:27] he had pools and not only did he have
[34:29] this house he had to keep track of the
[34:30] vineyard and he had to keep track of the
[34:32] pool and he had to keep track of the
[34:33] house no he had servants to do that he
[34:34] had maidens
[34:35] he had great possessions of not just
[34:37] orchards with trees of fruit but now he
[34:39] was a cattleman he had all cattle that
[34:40] exceeded anything that anybody had in
[34:42] jerusalem and then he gathered silver
[34:44] and gold and peculiar treasures from all
[34:46] different kingdoms
[34:47] and so the house was just arrayed
[34:49] beautifully
[34:50] and then to top it all off he had the
[34:52] best entertainment
[34:54] he got himself singers and he got
[34:56] musical instruments he had men singers
[34:58] and women singers he had musical
[34:59] instruments
[34:59] he had entertainment everything he would
[35:01] need whether it be drama whether it be
[35:03] singing whether it be orchestration
[35:04] whatever it was solomon went out and
[35:06] made sure he had everything he thought
[35:08] he needed
[35:09] to find satisfaction everything that he
[35:12] thought he would need to be
[35:14] life is fulfilling now i finally found
[35:16] that kernel i found that grain
[35:18] i found that attraction that really gets
[35:20] me going gets me up in the morning makes
[35:22] me feel like i'm alive it makes me feel
[35:24] fulfilled
[35:25] but verse 9 he says so i was great and
[35:27] increased more than all that were before
[35:29] me in jerusalem
[35:30] so we're going to read to verse 11. i
[35:32] was great and increased in possessions
[35:34] and
[35:34] mirth and joy and all the things that
[35:36] you could derive in this life
[35:38] he's pointing out specifically what his
[35:40] riches and what his power
[35:41] were able to accumulate for him with
[35:43] respect to natural things
[35:45] but then this is important also my
[35:47] wisdom remained with me
[35:49] so now solomon's saying i got everything
[35:51] that a natural man could have
[35:53] in life but i had something maybe better
[35:55] than everyone else
[35:57] i had a wisdom that excelled everyone
[35:58] else's wisdom
[36:00] but he says and whatsoever my eyes
[36:02] desired i kept not from them i withheld
[36:04] my heart
[36:05] i withheld not my heart from any joy for
[36:07] my heart rejoiced in all my labor
[36:08] and this was my portion of all my labor
[36:11] remember his wisdom remains with him
[36:13] and this is what he does he goes out and
[36:15] gets everything he possibly can
[36:16] everything he can accumulate
[36:17] anything he could could think of he says
[36:20] then i looked on all the works
[36:22] that my hands had wrought and on the
[36:25] labor that
[36:26] i had labored to do and behold despite
[36:29] all his possessions despite all his
[36:30] wisdom
[36:31] all was vanity and vexation of spirit
[36:34] and there was
[36:35] no prophet under the sun
[36:39] he enjoyed every single pleasure that
[36:40] you could think of right now you say
[36:42] well brother aaron did he have a switch
[36:43] i was like well no he didn't have a
[36:44] nintendo switch
[36:46] could he play fortnite no he couldn't do
[36:47] that
[36:49] but you take the equivalent in
[36:50] entertainment you take the equivalent in
[36:53] addiction you take the equivalent and
[36:54] how the mind
[36:55] would have been satisfied because the
[36:56] same areas of your brain that are firing
[36:58] now when you enjoy certain things
[37:00] it's the same area of the brain that men
[37:02] have been have wanting to fire
[37:03] throughout all centuries
[37:05] that pleasure center that endorphin rush
[37:08] all these things they tried to get
[37:09] going it's the same thing now they just
[37:10] changed it they changed the way that it
[37:12] triggers but it's the same process
[37:16] and you're saying ever i've enjoyed
[37:17] every pleasure of the flesh but i'm
[37:18] still
[37:19] not satisfied in the end now can we just
[37:23] start making this relevant for ourselves
[37:25] that if any of us in the flesh right now
[37:27] have thought
[37:28] if i could just live in a different
[37:31] place if i could just have the view of
[37:33] the mountains if i could just do this if
[37:35] i could just do that
[37:36] and you just go ahead and start lining
[37:37] it up whatever your bucket list thinking
[37:39] that somehow
[37:40] change of job change the location change
[37:42] in pay changing all these different
[37:43] if i could just have this if i could
[37:45] just make six figures if i could just
[37:46] drive a different car i'm tired of
[37:47] buying
[37:48] you know buying these used cards and
[37:49] whatever it is you think that's finally
[37:51] going to click and make it work for you
[37:52] solomon wants to talk to you
[37:56] solomon wants to have a conversation
[37:59] and he wants to say hey look i promise
[38:02] you
[38:03] it just doesn't satisfy just not going
[38:06] to do it
[38:07] oh if i could just have this i can just
[38:09] have that how many can identify with
[38:11] that sense of
[38:12] emptiness we experienced when we got
[38:15] everything we wanted
[38:17] oh this is going to be awesome oh this
[38:18] is going to be great oh this oh i can't
[38:20] wait i can't wait and you're all excited
[38:21] you finally get it you're like
[38:22] well i mean i don't know that that
[38:24] didn't that really wasn't all i thought
[38:26] it to be
[38:27] and then in that very moment cognitive
[38:29] dissonance kicks in and you're like that
[38:31] was amazing
[38:32] why because you just spent so much money
[38:33] on it
[38:35] and you keep telling yourself it was
[38:36] worth every penny it was worth every
[38:37] penny and everything in your beam that's
[38:39] saying
[38:39] that was a stupid decision you shouldn't
[38:41] have done that that was horrible
[38:42] and your mind says no no no no no no
[38:45] you're creating dissonance
[38:46] i don't like this i'm very uncomfortable
[38:48] so you just no no this was awesome it
[38:49] was worth every penny
[38:51] but if we're honest with ourselves we've
[38:53] sensed that we felt that
[38:55] and solomon's trying to tell us
[38:56] something look i've got this covered if
[38:58] you could just listen to me i'm the
[39:00] wisest man in the world i've done it all
[39:02] nothing seems to satisfy me
[39:05] then he continues his talk he has said
[39:09] i had wisdom and he
[39:12] in his wisdom he could see folly in his
[39:14] wisdom he could see that wisdom
[39:16] excelleth
[39:16] folly and it's far as light he says it
[39:20] exceeds folly as far as light exceeds
[39:21] darkness so he's saying my wisdom is so
[39:23] powerful
[39:24] it's his lights exceeding darkness it
[39:26] exceeds falling but listen to the
[39:27] conclusion he comes
[39:28] to being the richest man in the world
[39:29] giving his flesh every kind of
[39:31] satisfaction he thinks he could give it
[39:32] in order to find peace
[39:33] and to find contentment he says then
[39:35] verse 15
[39:37] ecclesiastes 2 15 then said i in my
[39:39] heart as it happeneth to the full
[39:42] so it happeneth even to me
[39:45] i hope that just like really resonates
[39:48] with you
[39:49] solomon is actually saying i'm the
[39:51] wisest man in the world
[39:52] and the discontentment and the lack of
[39:55] satisfaction
[39:56] in all the frustration and all the lost
[39:58] hopes and all those things
[40:00] he's saying all those things happen to
[40:02] the full and guess what i'm the wisest
[40:03] man in the world
[40:04] and everything that happens to the full
[40:06] has happened to me he goes why was i
[40:08] then more wise
[40:10] what even benefit has my wisdom got me
[40:12] i'm the wisest man in the world and i
[40:14] still find myself lacking i still find
[40:16] myself wanting i still find myself
[40:17] miserable i still find myself sad
[40:19] then i said in my heart that this also
[40:22] is
[40:22] vanity even
[40:25] solomon's wisdom had not kept him from
[40:27] the vanity and sorrow of life
[40:31] there was still something about being
[40:32] the smartest man in the room that
[40:34] because you were a man
[40:35] you're still going to be left
[40:36] dissatisfied even though he was the
[40:38] smart
[40:38] the wisest man on earth there was
[40:40] something about just being a man on
[40:41] earth
[40:42] that he couldn't remedy there was
[40:44] something that he couldn't excel past
[40:45] and
[40:46] this is the point he's trying to make
[40:47] yes wisdom is is the principle thing
[40:49] with all thy getting good understanding
[40:51] but that has application to something
[40:53] very specific
[40:55] that we're going to come to hopefully by
[40:57] the end of this evening it comes to
[40:59] something very specific
[41:00] and what he's trying to point out is
[41:01] this human wisdom and human
[41:03] understanding and abilities and gifts
[41:05] and
[41:05] talents and all these different things
[41:06] and accolades they're empty in the end
[41:11] he says in verse 17 now this is heavy
[41:14] therefore i hated life
[41:16] because the work that is wrought under
[41:18] the sun is grievous calamity of distress
[41:21] it's interest it hurts me it's grievous
[41:24] unto me
[41:25] for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
[41:29] the guy who built the house the guy who
[41:31] built the house with a nice backyard the
[41:34] guy that built the house with a nice
[41:35] backyard and a swimming pool
[41:37] the guy who built the house with a nice
[41:38] backyard and a swimming pool that had
[41:39] people to take care of it he had lawn
[41:41] service and pool service was included
[41:44] and then he had all the live
[41:45] entertainment he wanted that guy
[41:48] said he hated life
[41:51] that guy said life is harmful it's a
[41:54] calamitous distressful it's interest
[41:57] it's vanity it's empty it's missed it's
[41:59] vexation
[42:00] it's torture i want you to relate to it
[42:07] this perfectly describes the
[42:08] complications of human existence
[42:11] and he's pointing it out as we'll come
[42:13] to he's saying he
[42:14] uses these phrases later that what
[42:17] happened in the garden that caused the
[42:19] mixing
[42:20] in the hybriding and the another way and
[42:22] another plan in satan's life which begin
[42:24] by a question
[42:25] and delved into a lie he's describing
[42:27] way we exist now
[42:28] because of that mixing he's describing
[42:31] the wrestling and the struggle that we
[42:33] all
[42:34] have to deal with and he starts talking
[42:35] about the inequality of outcomes
[42:37] if you want to turn to ecclesiastes
[42:38] chapter eight how you would think that
[42:41] certain outcomes would always be the
[42:42] same and that if certain things always
[42:44] happened a certain way then you could
[42:46] begin to they could be predictable and
[42:48] and you could say this is what's fair
[42:49] but he starts recognizing the inequality
[42:50] of outcomes the inconsistencies and
[42:52] experiences
[42:53] and because it's inconsistent and it's
[42:55] unpredictable and it's any
[42:57] there's unfairness to it it causes
[42:59] frustration it causes disappointment
[43:00] you're expecting something this is the
[43:02] way that it should be watch
[43:03] this is the way it should be and then it
[43:04] doesn't happen that's an injury to you
[43:07] but the battery even talks about how is
[43:09] someone is always crossing bridges
[43:11] before they get there
[43:12] when they get there and they can't cross
[43:13] it it so injures their spirit to
[43:16] actually cause
[43:17] physical problems because in their mind
[43:20] they'd already crossed that they're
[43:21] already
[43:21] i'm already on the other side and they
[43:23] get there and things fall apart things
[43:24] don't happen exactly like they used to
[43:26] they thought it would because they're
[43:27] planners and they figure everything out
[43:28] and when it doesn't happen they respond
[43:30] to it as if it's a greater calamity than
[43:32] if they had just prepared
[43:33] that it might not happen and this is
[43:36] kind of the human nature that's being
[43:38] frustrated when he begins to examine
[43:39] these things as the preacher
[43:40] the one who's wise ecclesiastes chapter
[43:42] 8 verses 14 to 17
[43:44] there is a vanity which is done upon the
[43:46] earth
[43:48] now listen to this vanity that there be
[43:50] just men
[43:51] these are righteous men unto whom it
[43:53] happeneth according to the work
[43:54] of the wicked in other words there's
[43:56] good men that bad things happen to
[43:59] he said this is the vanity upon the
[44:01] earth i see good men
[44:03] righteous men upright men honest men men
[44:05] of integrity
[44:06] who deserve good but get evil he says
[44:09] and there be wicked men to whom it
[44:10] happeneth
[44:11] according to the work of the righteous
[44:13] can you see how he's fig i mean
[44:15] he's figured it out there's nothing that
[44:18] exists in the world today there's no
[44:20] behavioral economics book there's no
[44:22] social sociology book there's nothing
[44:24] that has been written today
[44:26] that he has not already addressed in
[44:27] some way in ecclesiastes
[44:30] the inequality of outcome is saying you
[44:31] know i've seen good men who deserve good
[44:33] get evil
[44:33] and you know what i've seen evil men get
[44:35] good he said
[44:37] the good that this guy got is the good
[44:39] that this guy deserved and the evil he'd
[44:41] got
[44:42] is the good the evil that this guy
[44:43] deserved he said this doesn't make sense
[44:45] this is vanity
[44:47] what good was it for the man to be
[44:48] honest and upright and have integrity
[44:50] when the guy who lied got the deal in
[44:52] the end right
[44:54] and what does man learn from that to lie
[44:57] what's happened to human nature is it
[44:58] falls further and further down this this
[45:00] trap
[45:01] he said i said that this is also vanity
[45:04] he said there is no apparent reason or
[45:06] justice in life events
[45:08] i can't figure it out there's no rhyme
[45:10] or reason to it there's no justice in it
[45:12] verse 15.
[45:13] then i commended mirth because a man
[45:15] hath no better thing
[45:16] under the sun than to eat and to drink
[45:18] and to be merry
[45:20] now there's a tremendous principle with
[45:21] respect to this and there's a lot of
[45:23] depth that we could use
[45:24] to teach on different aspects of human
[45:26] nature and even what god desires for a
[45:27] man
[45:28] but he's saying in light of the
[45:29] injustices
[45:31] a lot of the unfairness he's saying just
[45:32] enjoy what you get there's nothing
[45:34] better for a man than to
[45:35] eat and drink and be merry and for that
[45:37] shall abide with them of his labor
[45:39] for that shall abide with him of his
[45:40] labor the days of his life which god
[45:42] giveth him under the sun
[45:44] hey look the good get evil the evil get
[45:46] good so just work enjoy what you can get
[45:48] because everything is so vexing and so
[45:50] vanity then he says when i applied my
[45:52] heart to no wisdom
[45:53] and to see the business that is done
[45:56] upon the earth
[45:57] again when he says under the sun on
[46:00] upon the earth he's taken he's including
[46:02] every single
[46:04] possible scenario that a human could
[46:06] experience from the beginning
[46:07] all the way to the white throne judgment
[46:11] he's covering all of it for also there
[46:13] is that neither day nor
[46:14] nor night seeth sleep with his eyes this
[46:18] is god is awake it's a god who never
[46:19] slumbers or sleep
[46:21] i applied my heart to no wisdom and to
[46:22] see the business that is done upon the
[46:24] earth
[46:25] then i beheld all the work of god
[46:28] that a man cannot find out the work that
[46:30] is done under the sun
[46:33] because though a man labor to seek it
[46:35] out notice his frustration
[46:36] yet he shall not find it ye further
[46:39] though a wise man
[46:41] think to know it yet shall he not be
[46:43] able to find it
[46:45] he's someone to see all the businesses
[46:47] done upon the earth
[46:48] and and really the application there is
[46:50] that there's neither day nor night seeth
[46:52] sleep with his eyes the business is
[46:53] constant it's continual it's always
[46:55] happening it's always unfolding but when
[46:56] he considers the work of the lord man
[46:58] cannot find out the work that is done
[47:00] unto the son
[47:01] though he labors he can't find it though
[47:03] he seeks he can't find it
[47:05] even a wise man who you think would know
[47:08] it
[47:09] he says he's not able to find it in
[47:12] other words the more the man labors
[47:14] and the more the man seeks the less he
[47:16] receives and the less he finds
[47:19] oh i'm going to find it through labor
[47:20] and work and i'm finally going to click
[47:21] it's finally going to make sense and the
[47:23] more he does it the less he's satisfied
[47:26] the wise man thinks he ought to know the
[47:27] more he seeks the more dissatisfied he
[47:29] is with his seeking
[47:30] so in ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 11 i
[47:33] returned and saw under the sun
[47:35] that the race well let me just slow down
[47:38] before we get to this
[47:41] i hope you caught what he was saying in
[47:42] chapter eight
[47:44] the inequality the the good the good man
[47:46] getting evil
[47:48] the evil man getting good so he says you
[47:50] know what the the best thing a man could
[47:52] do is just work
[47:52] get stuff and enjoy it while he can
[47:54] because in reality
[47:56] when you consider everything that's
[47:57] under the sun no matter how much a man
[47:59] labors he won't be able to find
[48:00] real purpose no matter how much he seeks
[48:02] he won't be able to find purpose
[48:04] what is all this business under the sun
[48:06] what is all the work of god
[48:08] man cannot find the work that is done to
[48:10] the son he can't find that thing that
[48:11] clicks he can't find the thing that
[48:12] satisfies
[48:14] so he says i return and this is just
[48:16] more of this
[48:17] complicated inconsistent contradictory
[48:21] existence that we have
[48:22] ecclesiastes 9 verse 11 i returned and
[48:24] saw unto the son
[48:26] that the race is not to the swift nor
[48:28] the battle to the strong
[48:30] neither yet bred to the wise nor yet
[48:32] riches to men of understanding nor yet
[48:34] favor to the men of skill
[48:37] are you picking up with solomon's laying
[48:38] down here you would think
[48:41] that the winner of the race is the one
[48:42] who's the fastest right
[48:44] say but you know it's not the fastest
[48:45] that wins the race oh you'd think in
[48:47] battle
[48:48] the battle would belong to those who are
[48:49] the strongest he said that doesn't even
[48:51] happen
[48:52] oh the the the wise will be able to get
[48:54] bread the wise will be able to gain
[48:56] increase
[48:56] the wise will figure that out no they
[48:57] can't do it you think the riches
[48:59] uh the the riches the real wealth is to
[49:01] men of understanding no
[49:03] they can't even figure it out oh and
[49:05] favor is to men of skill those who are
[49:07] skillful they receive the accuracy they
[49:08] receive the favor
[49:09] he is saying how completely
[49:11] contradictory life is
[49:14] that a race doesn't always go to the
[49:15] fastest the war is not always one by the
[49:17] strongest the bread doesn't always go to
[49:18] those who are the most
[49:20] uh sharp in business and the riches to
[49:22] men of understanding and the favor to
[49:24] those who have skill but he says this
[49:25] and this is so beautiful
[49:26] but time and chance happeneth to them
[49:29] all
[49:31] whether you want to say time it speaks
[49:33] of the untimely grave or even the grave
[49:35] but it also just speaks that time and
[49:37] chance you're at the wrong place at the
[49:38] wrong time
[49:39] that would have been better yesterday or
[49:41] that would have been good tomorrow i
[49:44] would go to my barber and he'd cut my
[49:45] hair and he'd say
[49:46] i'd say he'd go that'll be you know x
[49:48] number of dollars and oh i thought today
[49:49] was free tuesday goes no that was last
[49:51] tuesday
[49:53] how it always worked i always kept
[49:55] missing it was always the one before
[50:00] and this is time and chance
[50:03] happens to them all
[50:06] does that make sense to you chance
[50:11] oh man that was unlucky
[50:15] oh that was that's really horrible
[50:17] that's some bad fortune
[50:19] it's in every single one of them whether
[50:20] it be the fast the strong
[50:22] the wise the understanding the men of
[50:24] skill time and chance
[50:25] happens to all of them there's no
[50:28] resting
[50:28] in riches there's no resting in skill
[50:30] there's no resting in
[50:32] understand there's no rest in the
[50:33] strength there's no rest in being the
[50:34] the fastest because he says time and
[50:36] chance happens to every single one of
[50:37] them
[50:38] she said what promise does all our hard
[50:41] work hold
[50:42] in light of this fact he said well i
[50:44] just want to be the fastest well chance
[50:46] happens to the fastest they don't always
[50:48] win
[50:48] well i just want to be the strongest
[50:49] that doesn't guarantee you victory
[50:52] what does it matter if we all labor and
[50:54] we strive we try to do all these things
[50:56] he's pointing out the the complications
[50:59] of this life how you would think the
[51:00] fastest would win a race when the goal
[51:02] is to get there first
[51:04] you think the strongest would win
[51:05] battles when it's might over might and
[51:07] who would be the best but these are all
[51:09] the observations of a wise man
[51:11] who's recognizing the disharmony the
[51:13] inconsistencies
[51:14] the the chaos the confusion and the
[51:17] complications
[51:18] of just being a man the complications of
[51:21] just being a human being
[51:24] that the things you think will work
[51:25] don't work the things that you think
[51:26] shouldn't work do work
[51:28] the people that you think deserve a
[51:29] reward don't get it
[51:31] the fast don't win the races the strong
[51:33] but win the wars he's saying this is
[51:34] all this is a man i hope you're able to
[51:36] just see this picture
[51:38] and i realize the failure could be on my
[51:39] part just to adequately convey it but
[51:41] this is a man looking at all of life and
[51:43] being able to say
[51:44] this doesn't make sense
[51:47] mankind is irrational he's unpredictable
[51:51] that you can't even you can't even
[51:52] figure this out from that out all this
[51:54] chaos trying to make sense of all this
[51:56] chaos
[51:56] it doesn't even make sense because when
[51:58] you ought to do this you do that and
[51:59] it's so
[52:00] it's so utterly chaotic he's just saying
[52:02] this is the way that it is
[52:05] i imagine solomon if he had time he
[52:07] would have described us just all these
[52:09] biases we have in our minds
[52:10] that don't make any sense at all
[52:13] he's recognizing him he's getting all
[52:16] the heuristics laid out right here in
[52:17] ecclesiastes chapter three
[52:18] these are all the things that are
[52:19] happening to man and all these things we
[52:21] try to explain well this is why it's
[52:22] happening and this is why it's happening
[52:23] we're only trying to
[52:24] make sense of why man is the way he is
[52:26] why outcomes are irrational why things
[52:28] are unpredictable
[52:29] why things don't seem to line up why
[52:30] things are so complicated
[52:35] ecclesiastes chapter 10 verses 6 to 9.
[52:44] ecclesiastes chapter 6 verses 6 excuse
[52:47] me
[52:47] ecclesiastes chapter 10 verses 6 to 9.
[52:51] here's some more of his frustrations
[52:54] folly is set in great dignity
[52:58] and rich the rich sit in the low place
[53:02] that doesn't make sense does it folly
[53:04] gets the the crown
[53:06] folly gets the respect folly gets all
[53:08] the attention but
[53:09] the rich sit in a low place he said the
[53:12] rich ought to be in a high place
[53:14] in folly and foolishness that why why
[53:16] would that get dignity why would that be
[53:17] respected why would people follow that
[53:19] why would people revere that
[53:20] i have seen servants upon horses and
[53:23] princes walking as servants upon the
[53:24] earth
[53:26] the do you see the imagery the imagery
[53:29] what he's trying to convey this picture
[53:31] doesn't make sense here's a servant on a
[53:33] horse and a prince walking
[53:35] and walking beside it that doesn't make
[53:37] sense verse eight
[53:38] heat now this is this i hope i hope you
[53:41] can catch this
[53:42] he that dig at the pit shall fall into
[53:44] it
[53:46] now you say oh the guy who lays a trap
[53:48] the guy who lays a snare
[53:49] that's the guy that's going to get it
[53:51] absolutely that fits perfectly
[53:53] but his observation let's be a little
[53:55] bit more simple about it
[53:57] as he said the folly is set in great
[53:59] dignity that's kind of
[54:01] an opposite outcome that you would
[54:02] expect the rich sit in a low place you'd
[54:04] think by virtue of being rich they would
[54:06] have achieved the high place he's saying
[54:07] the servants are upon the horses when
[54:09] the prince has to walk beside it walking
[54:11] as a servant
[54:12] you would think that the benefit of
[54:13] being the prince would be that you'd get
[54:14] to ride on a horse
[54:15] he's saying things don't make sense
[54:17] anymore
[54:19] and then it speaks to the labor and the
[54:21] travail that man is tasked with
[54:22] in the man labors and man works he says
[54:24] the man who digs a hole
[54:26] he falls into it what was his job to dig
[54:29] the pit what happens he falls into the
[54:31] pit
[54:33] he's he's he is he is found to be
[54:36] injured by his labor i was trying to dig
[54:39] a pit
[54:40] and now i've fallen into it and then
[54:42] this just continues the same he uses
[54:44] these four different examples to make
[54:45] the same point
[54:46] whoso breaketh the hedge the guy who's
[54:48] trimming the hedge the guy who's doing a
[54:49] little bit of gardening
[54:50] a serpent shall bite him he's just
[54:53] trying to work
[54:54] i'm just trying to trim the hedges i'm
[54:57] just trying to do a little bit of
[54:58] gardening i'm just trying to pull the
[54:59] weeds out i'm trying to keep the
[55:00] vineyard clean i'm trying to this is
[55:01] this is my job i've been asked
[55:03] to purge the vineyard i've been asked to
[55:05] clean it i've been asked to dress it
[55:06] i've been asked to trim the hedges and
[55:08] what do i get for my word i get bit by a
[55:09] snake
[55:11] again think very simply now don't think
[55:13] about the types and things that are
[55:14] being referred to in here this is
[55:15] solomon just being very simple
[55:17] and very real about what happens to man
[55:20] whoso removeth stones
[55:21] shall be hurt there with in other words
[55:23] a man's job is to remove stones what
[55:24] happens it gets cut by them
[55:27] think about even the travail that we
[55:29] experience in natural labor
[55:31] sisters you just want to bake a cake
[55:33] that's all you want to do you want to
[55:34] have a nice cake you want to bake some
[55:35] chicken you want to cook something what
[55:37] happens you cut yourself you burn
[55:38] yourself
[55:39] all you're wanting to do is prepare a
[55:40] meal i say well that's is that really
[55:43] what he's saying yes this is what he's
[55:44] saying
[55:46] all you want to do is domesticate all
[55:47] you want to do is work all you want to
[55:49] do is do your job all you want to do is
[55:50] do it right
[55:51] but in doing it there's always some
[55:52] injury some harm you're you're simple in
[55:54] what you're trying to do you're sincere
[55:56] in what you're trying to do there's no
[55:57] guile and trying to bake a cake there's
[55:58] no guy
[55:59] in trying to put something uh put a nice
[56:01] dinner together but you go to grab
[56:02] something and you burn yourself you're
[56:04] cutting something
[56:04] and you you cut yourself he said this is
[56:06] what happens to man
[56:08] no matter what he tries to do there's
[56:09] something he gets bit by a snake he
[56:11] falls into the hole he cuts himself with
[56:13] the stones and he that cleaveth wood
[56:14] shall be endangered thereby there's
[56:16] splinters there's fragments that fly off
[56:18] he said this is what happens to man
[56:20] you chop wood well there's a damn
[56:22] downside to chopping wood you want to
[56:23] trim hedges there's a downside to trim
[56:25] and hedges
[56:26] you want to pick up stones you want to
[56:27] gather stones well you can be hurt by
[56:29] them
[56:30] i was just trying to pick one up through
[56:31] my back out and
[56:33] this is what he's describing this is the
[56:35] vanity
[56:37] this is the frustration is there anybody
[56:40] individually by
[56:41] hand or amen could say i think i'm
[56:43] seeing the picture
[56:45] that solomon is is laying out here that
[56:47] we can all relate to it in some way
[56:49] that's the life you live seems like no
[56:52] matter what you try to do there's
[56:54] there's a caveat to it there's a
[56:55] complication there's something that
[56:56] happens like i'm just trying to provide
[56:58] for my family
[56:59] i'm just trying to do this i'm just
[57:01] trying to do that i'm not out there
[57:03] trying to get rich on a quick stock sale
[57:05] i'm not out there trying to get do this
[57:06] i'm not trying to do that i'm just
[57:07] trying to be simple just trying to live
[57:09] my life and solomon said hey
[57:10] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how
[57:12] wise you are it doesn't how smart you
[57:14] are
[57:14] it doesn't matter how good you are
[57:15] doesn't matter your pedigree or your
[57:16] legacy
[57:17] all those different things listen this
[57:19] is just life it's complicated
[57:23] he's wanting us to all understand this
[57:25] is just the way that it is and i'm the
[57:26] wisest man in the world
[57:27] and i figured this out this is what
[57:29] happens to man because he breathes
[57:31] this is what happens to woman because
[57:32] she lives this is what happens to all
[57:34] humanity
[57:35] it's a complicated confusing chaotic
[57:38] inconsistent
[57:38] contradictory life amen to that solomon
[57:43] that's the preacher i can say amen to
[57:45] he's dead on he's figured it out
[57:48] and then let's just back up to
[57:49] ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 29
[57:52] because he says something nearly right
[57:53] in the middle of this book that is so
[57:55] profound
[57:59] ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 29 and we
[58:01] may just
[58:02] uh um leave off with some of this and
[58:05] and get to it on sunday
[58:07] and just maybe make a few references
[58:08] here in closing just to get your minds
[58:11] really pondering these things lo this
[58:13] only have i found
[58:16] that god made man upright
[58:19] but they have sought out many inventions
[58:24] he said this is what i found this only
[58:26] have i found so this has a way
[58:29] of putting everything into perspective
[58:32] all the vanity
[58:32] all the labor all the hardship whether
[58:34] you want to talk about an ecclesiastes
[58:36] 10
[58:37] 9 8 chapter 2 all these places we've
[58:39] read he says the reason for the vanity
[58:43] is man has become corrupted that's the
[58:46] reason for it
[58:48] and he's alluding the phrase he uses
[58:50] here that god
[58:51] made hath made man upright brings us
[58:54] back to genesis 1 and 2.
[58:57] this is exactly the comparison the
[58:59] wisdom that solomon begins to have
[59:00] he says i know why things are crazy i
[59:03] know why things are chaotic
[59:05] because this isn't the way that god
[59:06] wanted man to be
[59:08] he's like the man may god made man to be
[59:11] pure
[59:11] god made man in his image that's the way
[59:14] that god made man
[59:15] but now mankind is defiled now mankind
[59:18] is misguided now mankind is irrational
[59:20] and he says why because man by mixing
[59:22] himself with infinite things has become
[59:24] vain
[59:26] man's no longer simple the man is no
[59:28] longer focused no man
[59:29] does not is no longer just desirous of
[59:32] one thing he says this
[59:33] is the problem god made man to be
[59:35] righteous god made man in the beginning
[59:38] in his image but now something has
[59:40] happened to mankind
[59:41] and now he says he seeks out many
[59:43] different inventions
[59:44] and has become vain he has devised so
[59:48] many different ways so many different
[59:49] views so many different disciplines
[59:51] so many different belief systems to
[59:52] resolve the vanity to give purpose to
[59:54] all his labor
[59:55] he says god made man in his image man
[59:58] has lost that image and now man is
[1:00:00] constantly inventing things and mixing
[1:00:02] things and trying to figure things out
[1:00:03] to make sense of life he says
[1:00:04] that's why everything is as chaotic and
[1:00:07] complicated as it is
[1:00:10] it's almost as if everything solomon
[1:00:12] proposes in this book turns on this
[1:00:14] verse
[1:00:15] man is not living as god intended man to
[1:00:18] live originally
[1:00:20] in the beginning god had an order god
[1:00:22] had a purpose he said outside of that
[1:00:24] it's all vanity it's all frustration
[1:00:27] it's all confusion
[1:00:32] this only have i found that god hath
[1:00:34] made man upright
[1:00:37] but they've sought out many inventions
[1:00:39] it's a lot of ways that that phrase can
[1:00:41] be amplified just ponder it
[1:00:44] man has come up with all different ways
[1:00:46] of viewing the world
[1:00:48] what to try to make sense of the
[1:00:49] paradoxes to try to give purpose and
[1:00:52] meaning i work i labor i tried to do
[1:00:53] this i tried it and i'm not satisfied
[1:00:55] so i will create a god and it'll be that
[1:00:58] god that i bring my labor to to be that
[1:01:00] god i bring my fruits to be that god
[1:01:01] that i believe
[1:01:02] that you plant a crop and the crop burns
[1:01:04] up and and there's no rain so you begin
[1:01:06] to worship the cloud god you begin to
[1:01:08] worship the rain god because you're
[1:01:09] trying to figure out why your crops
[1:01:10] didn't grow and you find out that you
[1:01:11] need the sun and so you begin to worship
[1:01:13] the sun
[1:01:13] and you see how life and all these
[1:01:15] cycles and all these evolutions and
[1:01:16] there's some way you're trying to make
[1:01:18] sense of everything
[1:01:19] so they create deities they create
[1:01:20] belief systems they come up with
[1:01:21] inventions
[1:01:22] they come up with calculations they come
[1:01:24] up with theories and they try to make
[1:01:25] the a hypothesis and they test and they
[1:01:27] come up with a theory and they're trying
[1:01:28] to make sense of the world around
[1:01:30] them that's the condition of man
[1:01:35] that's why everything's vanity and
[1:01:37] corrupt
[1:01:39] and i would love just to read so many
[1:01:41] other verses in this book
[1:01:43] but let's just go to chapter 12.
[1:01:47] chapter 12 verses 13 and 14.
[1:01:50] this preacher who said vanity of
[1:01:53] entities all
[1:01:55] is vanity who said i sought out to
[1:01:57] figure out why all this sore travail
[1:02:00] that man has exercised with it wherewith
[1:02:02] that god has given him
[1:02:04] all the vanity and vexation of spirit
[1:02:06] all these different things we've read
[1:02:08] the inequality of
[1:02:09] outcomes the frustrations the lack of
[1:02:11] justice all these things that we've
[1:02:13] tried to
[1:02:15] express to you from this book tonight in
[1:02:18] contrast to the way that it was in the
[1:02:19] beginning
[1:02:20] the writer gives us kind of this
[1:02:21] cornerstone right in the middle
[1:02:23] everything turns on this
[1:02:24] god made man in his image in the
[1:02:25] beginning pure and righteous with a
[1:02:27] singleness of mind towards his word
[1:02:29] but now man being corrupted seeks out
[1:02:31] many different inventions and that's the
[1:02:32] reason why everything is the way that it
[1:02:34] is he sees this disharmony he sees this
[1:02:36] incongruence so now when he's painted
[1:02:38] the picture of all this vanity he has a
[1:02:40] conclusion
[1:02:42] ecclesiastes chapter 12 verses 13 to 14
[1:02:44] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[1:02:46] matter
[1:02:46] the preacher has preached a three-hour
[1:02:48] sermon he's got 11 chapters he's laid it
[1:02:50] all out there
[1:02:51] he's completely described the failure of
[1:02:53] humanity the failure of wisdom the
[1:02:55] failure of all these different things
[1:02:56] and when i say wisdom it's more the
[1:02:58] intellect and the carnal understanding
[1:02:59] without
[1:03:00] positional place and purpose he says all
[1:03:02] these things are vexation and trouble
[1:03:04] and calamity he says so let's come to
[1:03:06] the conclusion of the matter
[1:03:07] fear god and keep his commandments
[1:03:10] the wisest man in the world realized the
[1:03:14] one who
[1:03:14] saw the human condition the one who had
[1:03:17] everything
[1:03:19] everything he had it every category you
[1:03:21] could come up with well did he have this
[1:03:23] yes he had the equivalent if not more
[1:03:25] did he have that yes the equivalent if
[1:03:26] not more
[1:03:26] he had it all he had it all he had it
[1:03:28] all he had it all you say what about air
[1:03:29] conditioning
[1:03:30] he had the equivalent
[1:03:34] he had everything that a man would want
[1:03:36] to some degree
[1:03:37] in the same equivalence as we would want
[1:03:39] to have it today and he still
[1:03:41] says and this is still applicable today
[1:03:43] it's more relevant now than i believe it
[1:03:45] ever has been in humanity
[1:03:46] fear god and keep his commandments
[1:03:50] this is a man that even at a time when
[1:03:51] men would have had more integrity or
[1:03:53] maybe at a time when there was more
[1:03:54] widespread
[1:03:55] there was not such a widespread
[1:03:57] connectivity to evil and filth and
[1:03:59] perversion
[1:04:00] and here he is just saying look at the
[1:04:01] end of the day this is the only thing
[1:04:03] that makes sense is the only thing that
[1:04:04] can give you reason to purpose
[1:04:05] fear god and keep his commandments for
[1:04:07] this is the whole
[1:04:08] duty of man or if it's not to build a
[1:04:12] house with a swimming pool and an
[1:04:13] orchard no no it's not that
[1:04:17] fear god and keep his commandments this
[1:04:19] is the whole duty the entire duty
[1:04:20] this is the only thing that gives man
[1:04:22] purpose and reason to be
[1:04:25] and he's he he says this in such a
[1:04:27] beautiful way for god shall bring every
[1:04:28] work into judgment
[1:04:29] with every secret thing whether it be
[1:04:31] good or whether it be evil
[1:04:34] there's the great equalizer he brings it
[1:04:37] right back to the beginning
[1:04:39] wherein good was mixed with evil brings
[1:04:42] it right back to the beginning when man
[1:04:44] began to mix and man who was made in the
[1:04:45] image of god the man was made pure he
[1:04:47] was made righteous he was made holy
[1:04:48] god made man upright without any
[1:04:50] impurities but now he's become
[1:04:52] he's become mixed with evil he says god
[1:04:54] is going to be the one that judges what
[1:04:56] is good and what is evil
[1:04:58] and he's telling us there's only one
[1:05:00] thing that could remedy the curse
[1:05:02] there's only one thing that can remedy
[1:05:03] the confusion there's only one thing
[1:05:05] that removes the complication and will
[1:05:07] navigate you through the complexity he
[1:05:08] says fear god and keep his commandments
[1:05:11] if we could simplify the fall the fall
[1:05:13] was simply disbelieving god's word
[1:05:15] and acting against god's word the fall
[1:05:18] simplified at its base
[1:05:20] at its most basic component it was
[1:05:22] leaving god's purpose for man
[1:05:23] god had a place for the man god had a
[1:05:25] place for a woman god had a word for
[1:05:26] them to live by he had things that they
[1:05:28] were not supposed to do and by man doing
[1:05:29] what he was supposed wasn't supposed to
[1:05:31] do caused the woman to leave her
[1:05:32] position
[1:05:33] the man to leave his position and the
[1:05:34] entire economy of god fell in that
[1:05:36] moment
[1:05:38] you see the economy the god's economy of
[1:05:39] innocence in the beginning
[1:05:41] the fall was simply disbelieving god's
[1:05:44] word
[1:05:44] and acting outside of his promises now
[1:05:47] let me leave you with this this is where
[1:05:48] i hopefully will not want to emphasize
[1:05:50] perhaps on sunday
[1:05:51] if that's what caused the fall then
[1:05:53] there's only one way back
[1:05:56] there's only one way back right now in
[1:05:59] the time we live in
[1:06:00] 2021 today in the in the midst of
[1:06:03] all the pleasures and all the amenities
[1:06:05] and all the gifts and all the science
[1:06:07] and all the technology
[1:06:08] and whatever it might be that makes our
[1:06:10] lives that we can use from
[1:06:12] vacuums that vacuum without us touching
[1:06:14] them they can map your house
[1:06:17] roomba just do your job the roomba
[1:06:20] horror stories are
[1:06:21] quite atrocious especially the pictures
[1:06:23] especially if you have pets
[1:06:29] all right are we over it yet but this is
[1:06:32] what man has cars that can drive
[1:06:33] themselves
[1:06:35] cars now that you can have particular
[1:06:38] cars where you don't need to worry about
[1:06:39] where you're parked
[1:06:40] you just need to know where you're
[1:06:41] standing and how to push a button on
[1:06:42] your watch and your car will come get
[1:06:44] you
[1:06:46] in the midst of all that and everything
[1:06:48] that exists in the world today
[1:06:50] what's the way back to simple life
[1:06:52] what's the way back
[1:06:53] to happiness and joy and contentment the
[1:06:55] word
[1:06:58] it's not even church because it's not
[1:07:01] programs it's not social connections
[1:07:03] it's not education
[1:07:04] you're not going to find it in politics
[1:07:05] it's not getting the right guy in office
[1:07:07] you're not going to find it in science
[1:07:09] there's only one way solomon the
[1:07:11] preacher the wisest man who saw
[1:07:13] everything that we see today
[1:07:14] says this is the conclusion this is it
[1:07:16] if you want to know how to live
[1:07:18] fear god and keep his commandments i
[1:07:20] know this seems really really simple and
[1:07:21] it's not really that deep but maybe if i
[1:07:22] could have
[1:07:23] took time to add up what all these
[1:07:24] numbers mean and fear god and keep his
[1:07:26] commandments and say well the a is one
[1:07:27] and this is two
[1:07:28] and all that adult maybe you come to 777
[1:07:30] and we'd all say that's it for there and
[1:07:32] that's it fear god keep his commandments
[1:07:34] but it's not in the types it's not at
[1:07:36] all the head ear scratching things it's
[1:07:37] not in all the great flowery things it's
[1:07:39] not an education
[1:07:40] it's not in all those things the soft
[1:07:42] living the pressures of lit riches and
[1:07:43] the nervous tensions that'll never
[1:07:45] you can't try to address those in any
[1:07:47] other way and resolve them unless you
[1:07:49] come back to the word
[1:07:53] only by god's word can we find peace and
[1:07:54] fulfillment
[1:07:56] in this complicated age that's it
[1:08:01] there's there's no other way that i i
[1:08:04] mean i realize there's certain things
[1:08:05] that maybe we could take time to teach
[1:08:07] and just you know principles of living
[1:08:09] and say well these are the seven steps
[1:08:10] to finding that your house is less
[1:08:12] stressful than it is
[1:08:15] and if there's somehow if it's somehow
[1:08:17] not coming back to a word
[1:08:19] the word of god and a word experience in
[1:08:21] your heart listen god will frustrate
[1:08:23] every
[1:08:24] single one of your carnal plans until
[1:08:26] you have a word foundation
[1:08:28] he won't let any of it work but i bought
[1:08:30] the book i did the program i've
[1:08:32] downloaded the app i paid extra to
[1:08:33] remove the ads
[1:08:34] and i'm doing everything they said i
[1:08:36] needed to do to not live a cluttered
[1:08:38] life i'm doing everything i could do
[1:08:40] to try to simplify and to do this and to
[1:08:42] do that and to eat right and all these
[1:08:43] different things
[1:08:44] and everything you try to do as a
[1:08:45] believer you wonder why you're
[1:08:46] frustrated you wonder why things don't
[1:08:48] work
[1:08:48] because everything you're trying to do
[1:08:49] as a believer if you don't have a word
[1:08:51] birth if you don't have the foundation
[1:08:53] of the word thank god
[1:08:54] he'll frustrate everything we try to do
[1:08:57] to get us to the place
[1:08:58] like god nothing's working what's
[1:09:00] missing and he says i'm missing
[1:09:01] you need to have a word birth you need
[1:09:03] to be born again and then you need to
[1:09:04] take my word and live by my word and
[1:09:06] then do all those other things and
[1:09:07] you'll find that they work
[1:09:10] and you'll find that's why some things
[1:09:11] work for other people and some things
[1:09:12] work for other people
[1:09:13] because it's discretionary because the
[1:09:15] word doesn't make a distinction but
[1:09:16] where it won't work for the believer is
[1:09:18] if it's outside the word
[1:09:19] you say what do you mean about that well
[1:09:20] the one guy who wants to go no carbs
[1:09:24] and he loses weight by no carbs the
[1:09:26] other guy says i mean i eat all the
[1:09:27] carbs i want i just don't eat after five
[1:09:31] right am i mentioning anything that
[1:09:32] somebody can say hello i mean this kind
[1:09:34] of starting to make sense
[1:09:35] they're both believers they both have
[1:09:38] the holy ghost
[1:09:39] and they both lose 40 pounds by
[1:09:41] completely different diets
[1:09:43] where the rationale contradicts well no
[1:09:46] you really can't lose weight if you're
[1:09:47] eating a lot of high fat you know i
[1:09:48] don't remember
[1:09:48] there well the only way to lose weight
[1:09:50] you know but
[1:09:52] it works why because
[1:09:55] god having that anchor in your heart in
[1:09:57] your life those things don't become your
[1:09:58] religion
[1:09:59] those things don't become your type post
[1:10:01] at the end of the day lord i'm just
[1:10:02] trusting you give me wisdom give me
[1:10:03] guidance lord you make the difference at
[1:10:05] the end of the day i hope this drives
[1:10:06] home
[1:10:07] listen god will frustrate every ideology
[1:10:10] every plan every viewpoint every
[1:10:12] paradigm
[1:10:13] every belief system every discipline
[1:10:15] every diet every goal
[1:10:17] until he gets a believer to the place
[1:10:18] where they surrender to him
[1:10:21] and they're born again that's the climax
[1:10:24] that's the ultimate that's what places
[1:10:25] you in the body of christ
[1:10:27] i'm a new creature in christ jesus and
[1:10:29] now you begin to live a different life
[1:10:31] according to different set of rules
[1:10:34] and i thank god he does it now even in
[1:10:37] that regards if you have a word
[1:10:39] experience in a word basis he'll still
[1:10:40] frustrate your plans
[1:10:41] until you realize at the end of the day
[1:10:43] my faith belongs in the word alone
[1:10:45] and not a fad diet my faith belongs in
[1:10:48] the word alone
[1:10:50] instead of something else you've got to
[1:10:52] come back to that there's no growing
[1:10:53] kids god ways or five love languages
[1:10:56] or anything like that that's going to
[1:10:57] resolve child rearing problems
[1:10:59] resolve marriage problems you know the
[1:11:01] solution you know the resolution
[1:11:02] it's in the word of god let the word
[1:11:04] give you the wisdom let the word lead
[1:11:06] you and guide you
[1:11:07] explicitly specifically plainly
[1:11:11] let him do it there'd be nothing better
[1:11:14] for you than to be digging into the word
[1:11:15] of god and read a scripture and have it
[1:11:16] quicken to you
[1:11:17] this is how i can handle this difficulty
[1:11:19] with my child nothing better than to be
[1:11:21] listening to a sermon and brother
[1:11:22] brown's just laying in the word and
[1:11:23] you're quick and
[1:11:24] this is how i can resolve a bad
[1:11:25] atmosphere in my home it comes from the
[1:11:27] word
[1:11:35] oh wow i lost track of time
[1:11:39] all right uh we invite brother micah to
[1:11:42] come
[1:11:42] but i want to read a quote to you and
[1:11:45] this
[1:11:46] has so moved me it is so powerful
[1:11:52] i want to challenge us as a church to
[1:11:54] make a phrase in here that's basically
[1:11:56] three lines
[1:11:57] to make it our personal individual
[1:12:01] uh vision brother brown says what
[1:12:05] can help he's referring to the chaos the
[1:12:08] confusion the labyrinth
[1:12:10] the maze that seems no way out you go
[1:12:12] down this hallway and it's closed you go
[1:12:13] down this one it's closed
[1:12:14] he goes only the one thing needful only
[1:12:17] the one thing needful return to christ
[1:12:20] looking to christ as the only leader and
[1:12:23] walking in his footsteps
[1:12:26] listen this this is this is present day
[1:12:29] application to whatever you're going
[1:12:30] through right now
[1:12:32] doesn't matter what it is this is
[1:12:34] applicable
[1:12:35] return to christ look to him alone as
[1:12:37] your leader walk in his footsteps
[1:12:39] setting aside all other ways until we
[1:12:42] all reach the goal
[1:12:44] there's no other way but christ there's
[1:12:46] no other way but through the word
[1:12:48] and have come to the unity of the faith
[1:12:52] and then he says as the heavenly master
[1:12:54] built everything on the ground of the
[1:12:55] scriptures
[1:12:58] so should we leave all particularities
[1:13:01] of our special confessions and be
[1:13:04] satisfied
[1:13:05] with the revealed word of god which
[1:13:07] belongs to us all
[1:13:10] wow wow
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:16] i i mean you won't find something like
[1:13:18] this in barnes noble
[1:13:21] the master built everything on the word
[1:13:25] so we have to leave all of our little
[1:13:26] specific isms and all our little beliefs
[1:13:28] and all of our little personal special
[1:13:30] confessions and all our
[1:13:31] all our little ideas and be satisfied
[1:13:34] with the word of god
[1:13:35] that belongs to us all
[1:13:40] that's why you can like one thing i can
[1:13:41] like another i can think this works you
[1:13:43] can think that works i can
[1:13:44] i could drive a a chrysler because it
[1:13:47] was given to me and you could drive a
[1:13:48] ford and someone could drive a toyota
[1:13:50] and like ah
[1:13:50] a toyota and someone could drive a chevy
[1:13:53] and say well you know that 90
[1:13:54] of all fords are still on the road right
[1:13:57] why because the other 10
[1:13:58] actually made it home
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:02] those are just the kind of things people
[1:14:03] say and they get oh yeah i'm a chevy man
[1:14:05] and somebody drives a four no look
[1:14:06] before you on you
[1:14:07] you're no man but these are all the
[1:14:10] little special confessions and all the
[1:14:11] peculiarities you do this you do that
[1:14:15] listen this isn't a joke there's people
[1:14:17] that resent
[1:14:18] one another in church because someone's
[1:14:20] in the doterra camp and someone's in the
[1:14:21] young living camp
[1:14:22] i speak the truth
[1:14:26] it's a little special confessions that
[1:14:28] we have
[1:14:31] leave all that and be satisfied with the
[1:14:34] revealed word that belongs to us
[1:14:36] all that's what binds us together that's
[1:14:39] what makes us one
[1:14:41] that's why i can relate to you and you
[1:14:42] can relate to me though we have
[1:14:44] different backgrounds and different
[1:14:45] ambitions and different hobbies
[1:14:46] after the flash and different things
[1:14:48] that work for us and different belief
[1:14:49] systems
[1:14:50] when it comes to diets and education and
[1:14:52] how we're raising our children and what
[1:14:54] we let them do this way we do that with
[1:14:55] those different areas that we might have
[1:14:57] differences
[1:14:58] in discretion where god allows it but
[1:15:00] where do we find our common ground
[1:15:02] we are all satisfied with the revealed
[1:15:04] word of god
[1:15:05] that belongs to you just as much as it
[1:15:07] does to me
[1:15:10] and then he says this oh this is so
[1:15:13] beautiful
[1:15:14] with the bible in our hand we should cry
[1:15:17] i believe what god has revealed in this
[1:15:19] book
[1:15:20] i will obedient keep his obediently keep
[1:15:23] his commands
[1:15:24] i hope for that which he has promised
[1:15:28] that's just so simple to live by this
[1:15:33] i believe what god
[1:15:36] has revealed in this book i
[1:15:39] will obediently keep his commandments
[1:15:43] i hope for that which is promised
[1:15:47] how does that not cover it all how is
[1:15:49] that not a prophet taking everything he
[1:15:51] goes what can help
[1:15:52] what is needful what do we need to do we
[1:15:54] need to return to christ well then how
[1:15:55] can i live what can i do he says just
[1:15:57] take this bible in your hand
[1:15:59] and say i believe all that is revealed
[1:16:01] in this book i will obediently obey its
[1:16:03] commands i will obediently keep his
[1:16:05] commands
[1:16:05] i hope for that which he has promised if
[1:16:07] there's a promise that's not fulfilled i
[1:16:09] still believe in it
[1:16:11] and not hope is an enemy to faith but
[1:16:12] hope that he expects it to
[1:16:14] knows it's coming so he says christians
[1:16:17] give here
[1:16:17] there's only one life but death comes to
[1:16:20] us in a thousand forms
