TRANSCRIPT
========================================
psalms chapter 1 read verses 1 2 and 3 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful you notice as the progression if you walk in the counts of the ungodly eventually you're standing in the way of sinners and then ultimately you're just going to sit right down in the seat of the scornful so it's a treacherous path that we walk when we walk with under the council of the ungodly but his delight blessed is the man who doesn't do that this man this blessed man his delight is in the law of the lord his commandments his precepts and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen you may be seated we're continuing on the subject of uh god created we we had a number of services when we were looking at in the beginning we're still looking at in the beginning but we wanted to just take it from genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and take it a step further and in the beginning god created and by looking at this phrase god created we're looking at a divine attribute which god alone creates and with a divine purpose so god had the ability to create but as he created he did it according to a plan and a desire that he had within his heart and as god is creating and bringing forth the firmament and separating water from land and light from darkness he's establishing order and this is a god who's actually determining destiny we see in the beginning he's putting things in their position and he's painting a picture in creation that holds a mystery and that's that's a key that we've kind of been identifying is that when we read this we read it and then we see that there's something being told to us but yet there's more to what's taking place and so when god creates it's important for us to think that i understand that there was no external pressure working upon god when he created all there was was an eternal desire so there's no there's no factors on the outside that's influencing him there's no false motive there's no a false instigator something pestering him and bothering him so it's just the divine elohim there in the beginning who dwelt alone and something moving within himself causing him to create so it's all according to a divine intelligence and i use that phrase not to somehow compete with the evolutionists that no just look at creation there's got to be some intelligence behind that i think that's obvious and i think even those those inside scientists who would believe in evolution have to at least concede that there's some design intelligence within the organism itself that allows these things to come forth and maybe i'm just assuming they would at least concede on that point one thing's for sure if you ask them could you be wrong they'll all say yes could you be wrong they'll all say yes but there's one thing you can't be wrong about and that's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you once it's revealed to you you don't know by rigorous scientific methods you know by revelation and so as we read in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth this verse stands at the start of the revelation of god and and it caused us to ponder just to stop for a moment and think what is this what are what are the oh these opening chapters of the bible doing they're teaching us the knowledge of god and his will and it's very important regardless of what scripture we're reading we cannot read any scripture from the standpoint that it's merely a historical record and this is especially so with respect to creation we cannot read of creation only as a historical record of what god was doing or what he has done because when we read this we're not just merely being told what god did when we read this it's not just well this happened and that happened like we would like we read the newspaper we read the newspaper and we find out that there's there's been a fire in one part of arizona we're like no news there that's common then we read there's one in california and there's one in colorado and they're all just kind of moving towards each other we might say yep you know the br the bible prophesies that this earth is going to burn up that's why i don't argue about global warming i mean it's right there in the bible there's definitely a global warming that's coming but when we read that you're just being told what's happening you don't expect some inspiration of revelation and you're not looking for symbols or foreshadowing uh that's just reading a historical record what has happened we do not read the scripture from the standpoint just to learn what god has done but there's more to it we've read in romans where it said these things that were written before were written for our learning that we through um learning and patience of the scripture could have hope the bible says that all scripture is given by inspiration of of god and it is good for doctrine and for correction and reproof so every scripture even if it's telling you a story has some power to it to give you insight into the heart of god to give you a revelation of jesus christ and transcend historical record and do something for you presently so when we're looking at genesis chapter one and we look at chapter two in chapter 3 if we walk through those chapters it's not just to think about what god has done but to find the knowledge of god and to know his will and one statement that we used last time and we're going to pick up on it is in the message power of transformation where brother graham's identifying two different kinds of power a power to create or transform and a power to deform god alone has the power to create god alone has the power to transform something and and satan can only deform he only has to take exist he can only take existing substance and and pervert it manipulate it hybrid it do something to it but he cannot create something from nothing and in the beginning god created he was not taking something that previously existed but he was doing a new thing something new altogether and and so in this message power of transformation brother ram says there was adam and eve walking in the garden every seed bringing forth now this this expresses to us the silence between genesis the end of genesis chapter 2 in the beginning of genesis chapter 3 because we see that the woman comes forth from the man adam gives this great prophetic utterance and then brother branham saying what was happening is that they were walking in this garden of eden and every seed was doing exactly what the bible said it would do as god said in genesis 1 11 let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so so this was god's law the seed is in you the power of transformation to bring forth fruit it's in you and he says here's adam and the woman walking in the garden genesis 1 11 is being fulfilled he says every seed is being enforced and then with that image in mind he says oh i wish we could just stop here for a moment there is where we are facing yet the completion of that word so the the language that he's using is to say this is what we are doing right now says this is what we're facing this is what we're beholding this is what we're called to right now is genesis what began in genesis is now being completed we're facing the completion the finishing the fulfilling of what those seeds represented we're facing the completion of what adam and eve were walking in what they represented what they were to fulfill and and it's just establishing that just as uh foundational building blocks as we go forward now where we stopped last time and i apologize to anybody who wasn't here last time if this just seems to be like a real abrupt just bust through the wall like the kool-aid guy hey i'm here this is where we're at but i want to just go right to this uh to where we were last time because it looks it it helps us to fully better understand a number of different things but specifically how god created something with the plan and as he does something satan's right there to meet it so what say in satan's approach to god's creation and how satan now steps forward after the woman's come forth now we see satan animating the serpent now we see satan doing something it helps us to understand what god's purpose is and it may seem a little bit odd to say that but when you recognize the attributes of satan what he's trying to achieve you realize wow the the principles that we believe in the bible the truths that have been restored to us it's so much more than just what the original sin was and like oh well that's what caused the fall it's not just what caused the fall why did why did it fall why did it even happen how could god let that happen why would god let that happen and why would satan choose to cause it to fall that way because there's more to it than just a man satan just must have found the weak spot it it there's something that was taking place and satan's attack against the woman has to do with the hidden mystery of god the fact that he went right there and so i'm going to ask a question why did he target her satan and there's a number of scriptures that i think will hold off for next time lord willing satan opposed god's will he opposes the divine intelligence he's opposing the plan of god and we used some references last time to substantiate this claim and in doing so in being very quick to oppose god's plan he unwittingly played a part in fulfilling god's plan he didn't mean to but he did just as we read had the princes of this world known that crucifying christ would would be the beginning of redemption they would have never done it that's why brother branham he talks about the seventh seal if he gets a hold of this he could do great damage and you think well how that's really weird if satan really knew what the seventh seal was he really knew this truth that's unfolding the revelation was given if he really knew how could he do great damage that doesn't make sense in the same way that had the princes of this world known what the messiah was on earth for in his first coming and they would have hindered it they would have resisted they would have not played their part and so there's that there's a there's a paradox to that but if there's a truth to it and so satan uh without intending to do so was used in god's divine purpose and plan in ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13 speaking of lucifer and satan and used as a using an allegory of a king he says thou hast been in eden the garden of god so now we place lucifer satan the devil we place him in eden the garden of god or the garden of eden how we may say it and the satan now being placed there where we see him act is he immediately attacks the woman and if we could try to only uh hypothetically put yourself in satan's shoes don't want to scare anybody off but just think about how lucifer this angel would have been there witnessing these things unfold so god did not create all of creation create heaven and earth and then place and then create lucifer and he kind of just shows up all of a sudden in the garden he's like now what do i do what should i do he's there and he witnesses all of creation he witnesses the order that god established in heaven he witnessed before the throne and the cherubims and all that order he saw an image of something in heaven and then he witnesses god making man creating earth evoluting on up to man and then when he gets to man he sees that god is declaring these things about being things being very good and he sees that god expresses something in that man ought not to be alone and then he brings the woman out of the man satan is witnessing each one of these things so satan is just not blindly stumbling upon the man and the woman and then kind of think how can i what can i do this is my opportunity he sees something and satan is learning as he sees this and he has a particular understanding and insight and so this is what he witnesses in genesis chapter 1 verses 27 to 28. so god created man in his own image genesis chapter 1 verses 27 and 28 so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them so now when man was made he was made in the image of god and in that image was male and female and then immediately it says and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and he's establishing that adam is to be a god upon earth this man is to be fruitful multiply and replenish and now he is a reflection satan realizes he's a reflection of divine intelligence he's a reflection of the knowledge of god in the will of god that adam was not just uh the the next step as it were like well what can i do next what can i do if i've built how can i improve on on what i did last time and all we created animals and we created all the way up to this beast-like serpent and oh you know what let's put a soul inside of him and let's let's make that the next step no god all along was operating according to a purpose and a plan and so it says to this man and now i'm just going over these not to teach you because i know that you know these things but rather just to think ponder how that satan lucifer would have heard these things or had some knowledge of these things so the man is told to be fruitful which means branch off multiply which means become many and then the word replenish this really holds to me like the the the the the glue that just kind of holds brings those two together he's to branch off he's to become many and he's to replenish that doesn't mean just stack up bodies like cord wood until there's no more space upon the earth but it means accomplish it replenish the earth it means com accomplish or satisfy the earth so god had a desire that he wanted to achieve you can look at it in the sense that god had in his mind two million people and so to replenish the earth would be to bring that to two million bring the people to that place where you have you have that many am i already at an hour that's my timer take the name of jesus we will just pick up next time you can just turn it right off it's not going to bother me guess what i'm going to do it look at that let's see how long that lasts it usually lets me know when there's been an hour up and i start thinking i better hurry up but now i don't have that today take a deep breath stretch a little bit take a five hour energy i don't know can you remember where i was so here we are re replenish the earth you could look at in this sense that means to fill it up to its completion so it's not just merely make use of every single inch of space but rather if god had in his mind and i'm just using this hypothetically had in his mind that there would be 2 000 names written on the lamb's book of life he says bring those names forth and then once each one has been represented it's replenished like it's not just keep going in perpetuity but fill it up to my desire to what i've what i have in my mind if there's a dinner and there's 50 spaces at the table then it's replenished when all 50 take their seat and it has this meaning to accomplish or satisfy the earth so adam was to multiply be fruitful multiply and replenish or satisfy the earth satisfy the earth's purpose wow that's beautiful and if i get excited if you all you can do is get excited for me that'll work and so just so now we know the earth had a hidden purpose what was the purpose of the earth to get a bride out of it plain and that's exactly what god's purpose of creating the earth was for is to get a bride of his own choosing to get a bride out of it so just like the earth had a hidden purpose the woman now because she's represented in this male and female the woman held the mystery of god's heart purpose so satan looking at the man knows he's under a commandment to be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and he's asking himself how is he going to do it he sees how it's represented in creation male female male female male female but now how is adam going to do it now brother branham writes this he says the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him now we're not reading this to understand historical record purpose divine knowledge understanding to know god's will that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god so genesis 1 28 was a god's commission as brother bannon called it god's commission he called it an oncoming thing a promise so this was a promise that adam was to take through the woman he was to reproduce himself produce another son of god so adam being in the image of the son of god or in the image of god needed the woman or the female part in order to bring forth another son of god that's the reason why the woman was taken out of the man so satan is watching this and i wanted to put us in this standpoint of this beast in the beginning so then brother banner makes this statement the word that god spoke to multiply and replenish the earth it couldn't find a place to land in other words when the woman began to bring forth children she did not fulfill god's commission of genesis 1 28. when she had children and no matter how many children she had regardless of who the father of the children was it did not fulfill genesis 1 28 because god's word has to be in its season has to be the right person the right season and we know all those mosques that have to line up for god's word to be complete so brother branham says this prophecy and he takes handkerchiefs and and i wasn't there to see it you say well you look you look old but not that old i wasn't there to see brother graham demonstrate this unfortunately there's not a video of it and i always appreciate whether it be brother billy paul or brother george and different ones share with you what brother branham actually drew on the the white board or chalkboard and different things to know but he's using a handkerchief and the way it strikes me is he says here's this promise be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and that never was fulfilled by the woman he said it just laid their dormant all the time it couldn't find a place to land so realize now the commission of god and the will of god and the desire of god for the man is never fulfilled in genesis 1 2 or 3 or 4 5 6 or any of those it's not fulfilled in the beginning and so it's lays there couldn't find a place to land and then brother branham in part two of spoken words the original seed in the afternoon he says the life sperm of eve never happened so there was something that was given to eve there was the woman had was committed certain attributes certain characteristics and it held a promise or a potential and he's saying the life that she was to bring forth never happened even though she had gotten life from the lord it wasn't according to god's commission it wasn't according to genesis 1 28. so that word couldn't find a place to land the life the the egg the life of eve that she was to bring forth never happened why why did it not happen because satan caused the woman to fall through deception he he met her and defiled her mind and then through that mind came forth an act that caused her to fall now this speaks to the the connection is this is why satan did what he did he knew the woman's under this commandment this is god's commission this is a promise so satan's going to try to cause confusion about the promise satan's going to try to now not as a creator but as a deformer he realizes life has to come forth from this woman so i i want to be able to create i want to be able to have life so he goes he's trying to find the source of life now in genesis chapter 3 verse 1 he says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field he was shrewd he was crafty he was intelligent it doesn't mean shrewd and that you would look at him say oh my god this guy looks like a shyster but rather he would have been someone that was intelligent articulate he could talk he is more subtle than any beast of the field and we know that it speaks to his intelligence and the way he would work and the way he would think and that it would have been something that would have looked human-like otherwise genesis chapter 3 verse 2 would have been right because the snake just talked to me but we know it doesn't unfold that way so he says the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made he's a he's an upright creature he looks man-like he can talk he was had a duty that he had to fulfill in the garden he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden it's a question he wants to know what did god say to you about trees what trees are you allowed to eat of what trees are you allowed to partake in and we must think more deeply about this we know there's more to this than what the denominations teach and and their theological conundrum is what kind of fruit it was [Music] apricot pear apple but we know it's more than that and we've got to think maturely to catch the revelation of this question is satan just coming and wanting to know what fruits she's allowed to eat is he just there uh wanting to know which trees hey i haven't been here before what's good all right we go to a restaurant we ask what's good and the worst answer is when the server goes oh i don't know i really don't eat here you're like oh the one person who's been in the kitchen doesn't eat here okay what satan is doing is he's asking about life he's asking about creations and he's not asking a question about literal trees and literal fruit or permissible diet he's wanting to know about life and how it comes forth he's wanting to know about something more substantial than just what you should eat in isaiah chapter 14 verses 12 to 14 and i know that some of this is review from last time speaking to satan and lucifer how thou art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning howarth thou cut down to the ground now what does the scripture do it takes lucifer and it joins him to the serpent which is what cut down to the ground on thy belly they'll crawl the rest of thy life so the scripture now later on is making this direct connection that it's just not a beast in the field a beast there in in uh the garden of eden but rather satan has taken control of this beast so how can he do that remember those evil spirits entered into swine the bible even says and we'll maybe go into more detail on this later how that satan having entered into judas so he realized it's not it's not a scriptural prohibition that satan would be in the garden of eden because he said to be in the garden of eden nor is it prohibited that he would possess the serpent to cause him to make eve fall and here it says now you were cut down to the ground so by allegory or symbolically satan is cut down to the ground when the serpent is cut down to the ground so now it continues lucifer he said you've been cut down to the ground which did this weaken the nations so satan weakened or disabled the nations and that means humanity and the the serpent who's cut down to the ground he is characterized as having weakened the nations and then verse 13 for so through and because of this you weakened humanity because thou said in thy heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god which is are the sons and daughters of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation we realize there's more symbolic meaning to this than a literal congregation or a mountain and a congregation on it in the sides of the north it speaks of procreation a secret place i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high so because of this ambition in verses 13 and 14 he weakened the nations this is exactly what the bible's telling us he wanted to be like the most high he wanted that secret place he wanted to have the ability to procreate he wanted this mount of the congregation the sides of the north he wanted to be as the god before the children of god he wanted to be their father he wanted to be the first he wanted to be above them so what he does then is he comes in and according to this ambition of verse 13 and 14 he weakened humanity so this being part of his ambition he he comes to the woman and the devil's question was regarding whether this woman knew the secret of life he was asking this woman whether or not she held the secret for eternal life and i i'm not i can't speak in absolute terms because again i wasn't there but it satan wouldn't have known everything so he's he's trying to find out remember just like he did jesus if thou be could you be i mean he's looking like why why was abel immediately murdered by cain he's wondering is this the seed is this the one who is it who's my competition who do i need to destroy because i want to be the preeminent one i want to be the the one that holds the key and so he goes to the woman and he didn't attack the man but he goes to the woman and he begins to ask her do you have knowledge of this he knew she was given to the man for genesis for genesis 1 28 he knew that the woman came forth to fulfill be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth he knew that she had something to do with creation she had something to do with bringing forth of life she had something to do with finishing and fulfilling god's purpose replenishing the earth now if you're if you still have your bibles handy and i i apologize not having a a slideshow today brother tom asked me you're gonna have a slideshow today i said no i'm not going to have a slideshow he thought i was taking umbrage to the use of slide show like i only use slide decks no i just i don't i don't have a powerpoint presentation i don't have anything to show you today i apologize but i will make these notes available if you need them and he says this and let's look at genesis chapter 2 verses 17 to 18 because now we're getting down to the question you shall eat of every tree of the garden what trees can you eat of in verse this is very um very astounding and if you've never connected these things together we we want we want god to connect dots for you today so now this is what the woman is told the man and the woman are told to given this commandment the male and female the man being in the image of god genesis chapter 2 verses 17 and 18. but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof thou shalt surely die so the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a tree of death potentially there's a there's an eating a partaking of this tree that will result in death the day you eat this you will die so god gives this prohibition genesis 2 17 if you eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you will in that day you shall surely die and now there's a conjunction this is going to seem very very odd for god to join the two thoughts together and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him so satan is watching this progression and satan is watching as god creates and when the tree of knowledge of good and evil is characterized as a tree of death potentially and then god immediately gives the introduction to the need for a woman satan is now making a connection of what this woman represents and what this tree of knowledge of good and evil potentially represents to the man and the woman because to this to this point if satan never knew that there was another attribute of god that was going to be expressed apart from even adam now he realizes it's not good for man to be alone i will create a help meet for him i will create a second self someone who's equal but opposite someone who's complementary to his purpose someone that's going to help him achieve genesis 1 28 and it comes immediately after genesis 2 17 not that satan was reading the bible then but he sees the command don't eat of this tree the tree of knowledge of good and evil the day that you eat thereof you are not to eat of it if you eat of it that day you'll die and it's not good for man to be alone i will make him a mere self so satan's watching this now in the message marriage and divorce and boy i think that's a sermon that's really really we kind of really missed the whole point you know all the guys walk away saying he can he can he can you know right i can i can you can't i can't and that's all they get out of it and i feel like they didn't get anything out of it if that's all you got out of it i think at the very least what you should get out of is never do such a thing as that again and teach your children not to do it hey if we're all if we were all sitting around in 1965 then we could say you know go remain as you are and we would have consequences that we have to deal with but listen the commandment that was given in that from from god the grace that he gave to his people had a part to say go remain as you are but then this commandment to us as believers as sons and daughters of god was to never do something like that and teach your children not to do it i do not believe that what that did is give me as a man a card that i can play as a message believer that if my wife gets out of line i can play it a man told me one time he said you know based upon these things that if your wife ever tells you if you ask her to do something if she ever tells you that she's going to pray about it you have a right to divorce her right there and my immediate thought was i really feel sorry for your wife and i thought well no i wouldn't would divorce her so in reading this apologize for the detour there marriage and divorce holds so much more truth for us than who can marry who can remarry who can divorce all those things every man that's born of a woman is born in death as soon as he comes is that true bible teaches these things but when he is born into the creation of god he cannot die in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god in the beginning of the creation jesus christ who is the beginning of the creation of god we had a creation that unfolds for now jesus christ is the beginning of the creation of god now in the beginning when god created that established one thing right but now the beginning of the creation of god is something different so he says but when a man is born into the creature of god he cannot die he is from that other tree that was in the garden of eden christ eternal life comes by the tree oh you say she was a tree sure well they said thou shalt not take of this tree god said in genesis back there thou shall not take of this tree well this woman is the tree she is the fruit tree you're the fruit of your mother the fruit of the womb is you that's right and then the fruit of the tree of life that was in the garden of eden is christ through the woman come death through the man in the original creation come life to be born of a woman is death to be born of christ is life so if if i could try just to unpack that very quickly in this way not adding to not trying to clarify i think brother branham says it very very well but maybe just to rearrange it he is saying that jesus christ is the eternal is is the fruit of the tree of life he's placing him as the tree of life in the garden there's christ as a tree of life he's saying the woman is also a tree now he's looking at it now in the sense that you have and there are trees in creation now today where you have a male and a female of the trees and they had recently found two thousand-year-old uh fig tree seeds from israel and a group of scientists in israel begged those who had these seeds please give us a chance to try to allow these seeds to to to grow to bring them to life is that even possibly yes seeds are amazing let us have them we can let them come and in this particular specie of tree there's male and female and if you have the male you can't bring forth fruit unless you have the female that's pollinated by the male and so brother branham is correctly identifying now in a type that you have the woman as a tree but yet then you have another tree but in order for there to be fruit there has to be pollination there has to be both so he's saying the woman was a tree in the garden and then the tree of life represents christ and the fruit of that tree would be eternal life which is christ it's all one life not a different life if you have eternal life you have the life of christ so there's these this woman through the woman in the beginning she brought forth death as a tree but the man who spoken of that's represented there in genesis chapter 1 that is christ who is of the original creation there come forth life so to be born of a woman is death to be born of christ is life so the tree of life equals eternal life and now the woman is a redesigned tree because satan is her designer right so now the woman had this potential she had these attributes she had these characteristics that she must not defile but now through the knowledge the tree of knowledge of good and evil she doesn't produce the fruit that she ought to produce she produces a hybrid fruit a different kind of fruit so she's a tree but yet the tree has now lost its correct representation so going back to genesis chapter 3 verse 1 i'm going to ask you personally are you following me so far okay good if i haven't told you the story before i asked a church one time and said i said is everyone following me and nobody said anything and i almost got discouraged and i realized this is a sharp group of people no one can answer for everyone so nobody said anything so i said are you following me resounding yes and i was like oh these these people are really sharp you're really sharp so the question yeah hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden what is he trying to do discover the secret of life trying to understand the tree trying to understand the commandment the tree satan wanted to get to was the tree of life now do you think satan knows that knows what it is how it's represented how it's manifested like he's over there looking at this tree of life going uh if i could just have that tree of life god is hiding things and satan cannot create he can only pervert so he's want to know how can i gain access to the tree of life if i can do that according to genesis 1 11 each seed is as in each species to bring forth the life after its kind that's god's law of product reproduction let each specie bring forth of its kind of the seed that's within itself if he could just find that seed and somehow attach himself to it through the serpent then i'll have access to this eternal life and so this woman that came out of man he's asking himself does she hold the secret to creative power it looked like the woman would be the one and if you want to say brother aaron you're just it's just conjecture you're just supposing and i'll admit that but notice satan goes to her starts asking the question about fruit of trees and he's looking to her could she be the one that's to bring forth another son of god is she the one that's going to bring forth the promised one and so the question is asked yeah hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden verse 2 is not it's and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden which is true the bible said every tree that grows out of the ground is good for food so she's referring to fruit trees yes but notice the language here it's important but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die so now she's using a singular reference the tree referring to it as being in the midst of the garden but she says it's death if you eat it i want to point this out eve is confused about the promise and the confusion stems from satan's reasoning she knew by the devil's question he's asking about more than just fruit so she gets down to this it's about life and death and the if i could say this the conversation is allegorical i wouldn't even i'm not even suggesting that this is the literal conversation but this is the way it's described and if we take it literal we think that satan was actually peddling apples he was the original johnny appleseed almost said serpent seed he's the original here he is hey you know would be a great idea you don't you can't imagine the things you can get out of apples cider pies cobblers but it was there's this it's symbolically represented so now in satan's questioning about life she's saying now there's fruit trees we can eat of but now there's a tree in the midst of the garden and if i eat of that tree the tree that's in the midst of the garden then she says i can't even touch it lest we die even though the part about touching it's not even mentioned in the commandment which isn't it amazing that it comes to the book of life that sealed i can't even touch it let alone look on it so this tree of life the book of life the ceiling of the mystery there's this congruency in genesis to revelation so she knew he's asking about life and death now notice this about the trees genesis chapter 2 verses 8 and 9. she says the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden if you eat it you die now watch this genesis 2 8 9 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden i would love to expound upon this more in the future this is symbolic of a spouse a garden is representative of a wife so eastward in in storytelling is also used allegorically of the beginning eastward at the beginning of eden god had already planted a garden which represented a wife it represented the bride that he wanted to have and then it says and there he put the man whom he had formed what is he foreshadowing that he is going to be in her this union of of husband and wife bridegroom bride christ and the woman in his bride and then verse 9 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight now this means to the natural eye that it was pleasing that you look and say wow this fruit looks appetizing there's a lot of things we eat and we ask ourselves whoever took the first bite right because it just doesn't even look good to us but there's other things we're looking at oh wow this is appetizing and that's what it means it means to the mind to the eye it looked visually pleasing but after satan is done talking to the woman and she sees the tree and sees that it was pleasant to her eyes and the language that's used there has nothing to do with the mint the part that would say to the eye as it struck the eye it was pleasant looking fruit it speaks of something being stirred up within her lust it was pleasant to her desires so the bible tells us that if a tree goes out of the ground it's pleasant to look upon visually and good for food so god was not intentionally trying to trick adam and eve by causing every tree that grew out of the ground to be good for food telling them it's good for food and then actually saying but there's two of them that aren't figure it out if it was a literal tree that grew out of the ground it was good for food next notice what it says here the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's the tree of life that is characterized as being in the midst of the garden the other tree is the tree of knowledge of good and evil now god does not characterize the tree of knowledge of good evil being in the midst of the garden it's the tree of life that's in the midst of the garden but when satan asks the woman about the tree about eating fruit of the trees she says but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden she says i can't eat it but if i do i'll die but she's actually referring to genesis 2 17 the tree of knowledge of good and evil if you eat that you die it's eating of this tree of knowledge of good and evil in genesis 2 17 that god says results in death if you eat it now i know this is teaching in genesis chapter 3 verses 22 to 24 can i entice you with the promise of brisket in a little while if you can hold out to the end i'll tell you the address of where the luncheon is genesis chapter 3 verses 22 to 24. now pay attention to this now this is after the fall after they've eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims a flame and a flaming sword which turned every way guarding all four sides to keep the way of the tree of life this is again symbolic language pointing to who christ i am the way the truth the life this is christ the mystery of god in genesis 3 22-24 it is the same christ the mystery of god who's the seed of the woman in genesis 3 15. it is all portraying and representing christ who is in the image of god male and female whom the bride is embodied within so now after man has eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil he's told they're going to guard the way from the seed this power this life of the tree of life because it's repre symbolically now if he takes of the tree of life he will eat and live forever so i want you to notice that when eve says if you eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden which was the tree of life she says if you eat that you die she's confused on the promise so satan says in genesis 3 4-5 there's a tree that you eat and if you eat it you don't die right you actually live forever then there's another tree that if you eat and you partake of it that day you die so notice what satan's response is and the serpent said to the woman ye shall not surely die so notice how he's trying to create confusion about the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life if she says if i eat of the tree of in the midst of the garden and she's thinking that the tree in the midst of the garden is the tree of knowledge of good and evil and satan knows no the tree in the midst is a tree of life that's what i'm trying to find then he says well no if you eat that you won't die thinking about this this is how shrewd satan is this is how he lies now he tries to confuse us in our minds and twist and pervert so he says you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil so now he's perverting the tree of knowledge of good and evil saying no god doth no he's twisting the word to confuse the woman about the promise of life he's mixing the trees already in his conversation and he says god doth no he's trying to confuse her on this promise why he's wanting to destabilize her and he's actually trying to produce fear oh god hasn't told you everything oh you didn't know god knows this is why god doesn't want you eat of that tree god knows that when you do you'll be like him he says ye shall be as gods the word god's there is elohim ye shall become as elohims little elohims you shall become sons and daughters of god why is this important this is exactly what satan's ambition was in isaiah 14 14 i will be like the most high he's saying if you eat of this you will be like the most high he's projecting his inspiration his aspiration he's projecting his desire if you eat of that tree you'll be like the most high and he wants to be the progenitor of that he wants to be the father of that now when he says you shall be like the most high he's not only revealing his agenda but he's targeting god's ambition he's targeting the heart purpose of god and expo when he exposes his true motive because brother branham said it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride so god's desire is that the people would be his gods god's desires that he would have a bride of his own choosing a people that would be like unto himself that would be like the most high god created the earth for a purpose to get a people who are like himself out of it to get a word bride in other words god wanted a god-like people he wanted a bribe that would be in his image and in his likeness there would be life of his life power of his power that's what god wanted so satan's not way off in left field about what god's ambition is but he's confusing the way to it he's obscuring the truth of it and he's actually enticing her to death not life the bible says in first timothy chapter 3 verse 16. and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness great is the mystery of equality with god great is the mystery of god-likeness god was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preaching to gentiles believed on in the world received up in the glory who was this jesus christ the mystery of god likeness or equality was manifested in the man jesus christ who is that the last adam who is he connected with who does he represent the tree of life he's the the promise genesis 1 28 be fruitful multiply and replenish earth that's god's original spoken word seed it never landed in the womb of a woman until mary received it one day genesis 1 28 the original spoken word seed caught in the womb of a fifteen-year-old girl so then the man that she brings forth is not like the fallen creation not coming through a redesigned tree as being part of her fruit but rather it's the seed of the woman apart from human instrumentality and it revives the commandment of genesis 1 20. it's the beginning of the creation of god why did it happen that way god wanted it that way god planted it that way the folly of man had to be manifested the sin of man had to be expressed there had to be death and disease and darkness and doubt and unbelief and failures and ups and downs and ups and downs in israel has chosen up and down and in and out finally restored back out again finally restored finally god's like you know what behold i send elijah the prophet i'm going to turn to the gentiles and then the very next chapter the very next book the birth of jesus was on this wise different than every other man that came before the child in her is conceived of the holy ghost so this is the mystery of god likeness this is the mystery of godliness manifested in the man christ jesus it's the same mystery of god-likeness or equality that's manifested in his bride in this last days ephesians chapter 5 verses 31-32 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife where does this phrase come from genesis chapter 2 and they too shall be one flesh because what did adam say you are born of my bone flesh of my flesh you shall be called woman because you're taken from the man and so paul now picks up the mystery of genesis chapter 2 speaking to the ephesians church which is the church that can be placed and he says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh has he not already said that no man had have ever yet hated his own flesh speaking about his wife who is this true of adam because let's be honest guys our wives are not literally our own flesh our own dna but the woman in the beginning was adam's flesh and the bride of christ is the flesh of christ so no man has ever yet hated his own flesh it speaks of adam and christ and what's their instinct to redeem not put away they too shall be one flesh and he says this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church not you men and your wives i speak of the great mystery which is christ and his bride that they shall be one flesh they will be power of his power life of his power she will be him elohim and elohir all right don't criticize me and get onto me for that it's just a play on words he's saying that this in the bride will be the original plan manifested the mystery finished she is him so he says you shall be as gods he's looking at he knows what god's desire is right equality a woman like unto himself he wants to become a bride so he has to first become a bridegroom he didn't become a woman first he became the man first why because god wanted to achieve a bride and the only way he could achieve a bride is become a bride he could just become a bride until he first became the bridegroom brother braham said in christ as a mystery he loved fatherhood in order for him to become a father he had to become the son of man so god has to become to fulfill his purpose so now we see this mystery of god likeness so he says ye shall not surely die he's using the characteristics of the tree of life in and twisting it with the tree of death tree of knowledge of good and evil he's trying to gain access to the power of that tree now we read this last time we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was jesus the other tree is definitely satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree this was the fruit of that tree was the female tree mixing with the wrong tree that brought death right i mean the woman it was the woman conceived death she didn't she wasn't carrying death to begin with because that means death would have been an atom she had to conceive it so the wrong hybriding the mixed pollen pollenization now of trees using that type or that allegory so now he says the other tree is definitely satan because of the fruit of the tree that came forth it says now skipping a little bit now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god was to share his eternal life with man so he wanted to have a means by which he could share eternal life and and i'm just going to inject this now god in order to share eternal life wanted to first deal with death just so that your eternal life can be so secure and so certain i'm gonna defeat death for you i'm gonna allow it to mature i'm allowed to come forth i'm allowed to seemingly burst forth first but i'm gonna hide a mystery in this listen no wonder god allowed adam and the woman to come forth and we all are represented in them that's our first birth but god hid the revelation of a second birth there's a new birth and i i wanted to maybe go down this line today that there is a new birth in christ to become a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new that's your promise that's what we ought to be tied to and that's why the most foul doctrine that can be perverted is the doctrine of the new birth you pervert that to the peril of god's seed because with the false revelation of the new birth the person can't come to life one of the most damnable heresies and so he says it's god's purpose to share his life with man eternal life with man and then and then i'm going to skip over it but he says and because of that it was necessary that god predestinated a man who required salvation to give him what reason to exist purpose of existing so he says thus what god worked out in here in the garden was his predestinated plan used satan's ambition against him he knew satan would go after that woman he knew that he could use satan's own ambition to bring forth the product that would need that only god could redeem god didn't god didn't make it wicked god didn't make it sick god didn't pervert it for you to go to him like some kind of master manipulator and some kind of control it's always making you feel sick and always making you feel broken and always making you feel like you need them brother satan played that part so you know who the true lover of your soul is the one who wants to feed you and heal you and anybody that always makes you feel broken so they can feel necessary is somebody you need to be armed linked with somebody always makes you feel compromised because they're the one that can give you relevance always makes you feel sick because they're the ones that got what you need to be healed always makes you feel broken because they're the ones that knows how to fix you there's one that knows that that's christ and he's not the breaker he's the healer the one that breaks you in order to fix you as someone who's got some kind of ulterior motive but god will let satan run amok so you can know who the real healer is i know it's a pair of dogs he said what god worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god then man could not get to that tree of life in the garden certainly not it was not time so god had represented somewhere somehow according to god's original spoken word seed there was going to be some access to that tree of life some access to eternal life some access to power in order to produce another son of god but he said it was not time god had an appointed time for this so now let's look at psalms chapter 1 verses 1 to 3. aren't you glad i didn't say psalms 19. psalms chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly now we could even put the woman in this nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful we can actually look at the history of the antichrist how it it starts with the doctrine a deed then it becomes a doctrine then it becomes death you're walking in the council of the ungodly then you're standing in the way of sinners it becomes a doctrine a way of life it becomes binding and then it results in the seed of the scornful which is death it becomes enthroned in death crowned in death and you can actually see this scripture is psalms 1 1-3 is speaking allegorically uh of this but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night the man who has rejected satan's lies the man who does not follow the council of the ungodly and because he does not follow the council of the ungodly he doesn't stand in the way of sinners and because he has not fought walked and has not stood then he's not crowned with death he doesn't sit in the seat of the critic he's not crowned with death he says but he delights in the law of the lord what god says what his commandments are don't do this don't do that he delights in them in the law doth he meditate day and night and he says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit in his season because what did brother brahm say he's now guarded the tree of life he says they couldn't get to it because it wasn't time so now he says he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so now the man is described as a tree that's planted by rivers of water that has a season which his fruit is to come forth and genesis 2 10 says and a river went out of eden to water the garden and vincent was parted and became two heads in the garden where the tree of life was the tree of life in the midst of the garden it says there was a river that went out of eden to water the garden in the gardens where god put the man in the garden is where the tree of life is and now he's describing man as a tree of life that brings forth fruit in his season he's talking about christ so brother branham says in spoken words the original seed the life sperm of eve never happened it never did why she mingled it she kept it away and i know you're familiar with this statement brother man says eve would have finally brought that child forth eve would have eventually brought forth the word so the potential is there but then brother branson says mary is the one that brought forth eternal life right and then what did god write pick up your pen and write the word is in the bride as it was in mary oh wow this is really the puzzle just all these pieces coming together so he says it never happened she mingled it kept it away instead of adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be so there was a time appointed for the tree of life to bring forth eternal life there was a time appointed to partake in it but brett says it wasn't time satan according to his own will and his own plan seems to interrupt god's plan but what happened what god worked out in the garden was his predestinated plan and once it was brought to pass what was necessary to give god purpose then man is now sealed off from the tree of life at that time until the appointed time so he says now he changed his picture just like christ would have come to the group who the next woman the church christ would have come to his church he promised to do it god promised to multiply but they had to wait until god's time so again when the woman comes forth that's one part but then there's a season there's an appointed time there's a predestinated purpose and plan in order for there to be oneness to finish god's purpose and he's saying christ would have come the bridegroom tree would have come to that bride tree on the day of pentecost but they didn't wait the bride tree comes forth at the birth of the church but they had to be with the bridegroom tree in order to bring forth the fruit that god intended for the tree they had to wait until god's time we see it in genesis chapter 18 verse 14 which is one of the most outstanding scriptures to us in types for us in this message that you have the the image of three angels coming before abraham and his wife who are under a promise but seemingly with no way to bring it forth and it says he looked he saw three men that came and he says my lord because now he knows there's only one and as they come and they said unto him they said where is sarah thy wife so now one is the lord but all three are asking about the woman to whom the promise is given who's going to bring forth the son right and there's a prophecy the seed is not isaac the seed is christ right so it's not just the natural part the royal seat is being represented in this so all three want to know about sarah but notice only one has a message for everyone to talk about the church talk about the bride but only one had the message they said where's sarah and he said this now in verse 10 i will certainly return unto thee he said the lord according to the time of life because abraham said she's in the tent behind me now everyone's asking but now there's a message for her only one has a message for sarah i'll return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son this is the message to her then verse 14. because she laughs she's thinking how in the world can i have a son how is this even possible doesn't make any sense he says is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return at the appointed place the appointed time at the tent of meeting at a secret time in a secret place broadband said the brides to come on the scene in the last days and it's at a time and a place that's appointed to her i will eternity according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son it speaks of the same potential that was in the woman in the beginning to reproduce another son of god now abraham chosen by god who is the father of our faith his wife is to have a son it seems like she can't he says is there anything too hard i will return according to the time of life the season for her conception and delivery the season to bring forth the promised son paul says in romans 9 9 for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah have a son i will return unto thee i will come again unto thee and sarah shall have a son do you realize what the devil's question was then in the beginning what was he looking at trying to get things out of god's timing trying to get it out of god's way because if when eternal life comes forth you can't die you can't kill that just as eternal as god is eternal so he knew there was one tree one way to bring death and is by the tree that god put there remember now just symbolically so he knew he could bring death but he also wanted to get to life so satan had a question and this is where we ended last we were ending last time i'm going to read these very very quickly christ is the mystery god revealed just a few places i'm talking about the headship of christ being personally identified by the original headship so once you have the headship united with the body he says this we have the answer to the devil's question we have what he was looking for amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question i think we should associate it with genesis 3 1 what he was looking for what he was trying to achieve what he was trying to gain access to we have it he christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up the body so now there's no more penalty death no longer holds over you but but they were born according to the detroit knowledge of good evil it doesn't matter there's a new birth price has been paid the wicked one is snared in the works of his own hands oh my what have i done i i've played right into god's hands and even when he crucifies the lord of glory it only furthers god's predestinated purpose and plan because now through that we have access to life there's no more stain there's no more penalty there's we're not subject to his wrath anymore we have the answer to the devil's question he paid the price raising up the body he says the devil can't stand it why this is what he wanted to defeat in the beginning that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now because it's the reason why he met the woman in the beginning i'll just get to it very very quickly so i can skip over it it's immediately why revelations chapter 12 says that he cast satan to earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour devour her child as soon as it was born who is it the great dragon the old serpent called the devil and satan and where was he he was there in the garden and now he says he's spoken as being in the first seal the red dragon in heaven stood at the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born who was it he tried to devour the child when it was born the red dragon here's your prince here's your beast he was there to devour the child god caught it up into heaven to sit on his throne that's where christ is now till the time appointed until the time appointed brother mark says now this isn't another message now is the time for the seed to come forth now is the time he said and jehovah jireh he said i hope you got spiritual discernment he's talking about abraham now it's time for the revelation for the son that's been promised to be revealed to abraham's royal seed of the promise so now it's time at one time it wasn't time but now this time is the time where it is time right it's time remember i'm just fishing this morning time's not allotted to a man while he's fishing so now he's that's the reason he's setting up all these things that's the reason that the devil is hiding the way he is he was always there trying to destroy it but now he can't stop it everything he's tried he can't stop it whether it be to kill take a prophet's life or discredit the prophet take your life discredit your life tear you down get you mixed up cause you ups and downs and in and out look where you are you're here the devil's howling right now and you know what aggravates him when i point to each one of you and say think about everything you went through the hurts the pains the disappointments the backs being turned the stab in your back the the failures the lies everything you're here the devil couldn't stop it he wanted to he wanted to squash it out when there was total blackout in lao to see the devil said finally i found it total blackout total and complete blackout the tree of life has been squished out and then all of a sudden the lamb steps forward to take a hold of the book that you couldn't eat or touch and he's like wait a minute that's where it was all along you mean it wasn't in man it went back to god and he held the mystery of it and he sealed it and after i've done my last move now it's still there and no there's one worthy it's the lamb it's genesis 1 28 it's genesis 3 15. it's him and he takes the book and opens it and it gets gooder and gooder then he gives it to you and you who weren't worthy to look on it can now eat it hallelujah the tree of life restored again oh blessed be the name of the lord that's why the devil's all howled that's the reason he's how on the way is his wicked scheme has been uncovered by the risen resurrected christ in the headship over his body headship husband to wife headship you think i'm beside myself i'm not i want to say it for myself too you think i'm beside myself i'm not he's he's excited glory our night says we've got the devil's answer what what what not me that liveth but christ the word living in me the tree of life eternal life it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer it's time for you to come partake of this tree of life we have what he wants what he can't get what he was looking for in the beginning brother bram said it's here it's here it's here he says in paragraph 588 we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god proves himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the headship is here amen christ the risen lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer the manifestation of christ in you is the devil's answer oh he hates it because the full words being born into manifestation the very thing he thought he could stop in the beginning you're bringing it forth so he says oh the devil is howling about this this is what he's talking about the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone they don't have the answer he says when jesus come he says he stood alone and his church stands alone she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling what is he telling us the bride tree has united with the bridegroom tree it's manifesting the fruit of eternal life why because there's a people who will not die death is destroyed through you he shall crush satan under your feet shortly death came through the woman now death is defeated by the woman only god only god could write a story like this and had the benefit of knowing the end from the beginning so he could write the story and just put all the pieces where it needs to be so that we in the end could look back and see a perfect picture it's from the very moment that god became the logos all that momentum has come to this you could look at revelations chapter 12 revelations chapter 13. brother calls him satan and his satanic religion are in both of these beasts what does this message do it exposes the trail of the serpent so that you can see his trail relates to you what do the twins do they intertwine why he's trying to choke out the life so the trail of the serpent if you follow the trail of the serpent you see the footprints of god and he's always there nipping at him serpent always nipping at him and he can never defeat it because here you are today brother branham says this and god of this evil age he says what god what would god call a people out of this evil age for his name why would he do this the reason of it is to try her his bride when she is made manifest because remember this is the devil's answer in other words satan asked a question in the beginning eve got confused on the promise and gave the wrong answer but we got the right answer amen so that's why satan comes in his eden six thousand years right took god six thousand years to make his eden satan's had six thousand years to make his satan after god had made his eden came and tempted the woman and caused her to fall now after satan has reached his perfection of his eden he's the god of this evil age god raises up a bride a woman within his eden to do the damage when she is made manifest been tried been proven proved to satan here's the key phrase like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end as a seed starts in the ground it comes up through carriers the life of it but it ends up the same seed that it was when it went in the ground in the same way the seed of deceit fell in the ground in eden is the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel when it fell to a denominational idea at nicaea it ends up a super organization as the seat of christ seat of the church fell back there when the signs and wonders and the living christ among them it ends up in the last days under the ministry of malachi 4 and restores back the original faith that once was given you have a super organization then you have what a super people which is the bride pick up your pen and write it's all in there he says we find now that this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve she is not that type of a woman like it was in the beginning so shall it be at the end but this time we have the answer to the devil's question she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise she was confused on wrong prose that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face where does he try to pervert the promise the promise today i could get you to look forward to something that i'm telling you is going to happen and that's all you look forward to is what's going to happen and i can always put it off long enough where you're always just under expectation and i can always tell you what happened and really got no way of proving it so you just have to take my word for it it happened but where is he found in the today in the now that's where you want to find him if you know where he is today you'll know what he's been and you'll know what he'll be today but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name a people liking unto himself of course is his bride she is to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word every word well john your father-in-law was sending me all sorts of quotes yesterday brother paul just loaded me up and i kept thinking should i just print these out and read them and i just wrote back it's like wow you're really going to enjoy the archives because this is one of the quotes he sent me it's right here in my notes the word bride is heading up in the person of the word of god made manifest in this evil age that we're living in same message god of this evil age see where it's heading up and satan will soon take his intellectual bride and exalt this great one which is the antichrist the hierarchies and set them upon a throne and the whole world will wonder at him this is what happens when finally the bride is taken out of the way this can't happen as long as the bride is here because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and as long as you're here he can't take that place over the deceived every time he listen to this and it says that this great dragon he deceived all them whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life and that's so this discer this this power is only on those whose names are not in that lamb's book of life those who have the tree of life inside of them and every time that brother branham not every time but notice the connection between the beast in revelations 12 and revelations 13 and the bride he says and who is this melchizedek now we find him at the beginning his attributes and now you are in him then this is when the book of life comes into view you in him then now we read over here in revelation the 13th chapter the eighth verse the beast that comes upon the earth in these last days will deceive all those people on the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world the beast in the end does not have power over the bride so it's only until she's taken out of the way that he can deceive but the man says the god of this evil age the beast has come upon the earth would deceive all those who names are not put in the lamb's book of life slain before the foundational world in god's own thinking god the great spirit in the beginning before there was a beginning he was god did you know you were in him then if you're a christian now you was in him then and if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of jesus christ and when jesus died on the cross i died with him for i was in him then for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later hallelujah knowing that we who for the joy was set before him knew that as the tree of life one day there would be a bride tree that would bring forth the promise word knowing that the fullness would be made manifest again in the end it's the word bride heading up in the person of the word of god made manifest in this evil age he says just as satan has taken his intellectual bride god first is taking his bride and he who now letteth will let until she is taken out of the way oh i'm doing great on time i might actually have to start stalling because i we not eating for at least over another hour i'm not going to take a vote or anything now let me read just from christ is the mystery god revealed let's go i'm going to close on this now christ the works that i shall do shall you do also john 14 12 what is that and greater than this shall you do that's in time he goes where the greater work is going to come from it's kind of come from his body it comes from the bride see the same god the works that i do shall you do also more than this for i go into my father she says the church will be a little longer in the light vindicating his promised word as god did his promises in christ's body so was christ doing the same works in christ body the church i want to say this slowly so you you can catch this see now making his mystery known to his bride tree in the last day bringing forth the fruits that was in the tree at the beginning making his mystery known to his bride tree bringing forth the fruits that were in the tree at the beginning and then he begins to describe the pruning of every denominational branch that came forward because it came forward as soon as it denominated organized it died and he says she's all gone so what did her husband do come by and pruned it it brought forth denominational fruit lemons on an orange tree so he pruned it off brought forth kept up but where is the heart of the tree right in the middle and he's pruned them all down to right in the top he's got a seed down here in the root heart purpose of god life of his life power of spirit just think at the heart of the tree like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water he takes god's laws and loves in his heart and he shall be like a tree psalms one planted by the rivers of water his leaves shall not wither in his season he'll bear his fruit and here it is right and he's relating to the bride tree and where does the fruit ripen quickly in the top of the tree why the lights on it that's right in right in the top of a tree in this last days he's bringing forth a bride tree now remember he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see so it's it's it's a contrast the doctrine of serpent seed wasn't so that we could sit around and talk about how oh you know they're serpent seed right like this is like the 12th message church they've tried brother branham said usually if you're a seed you catch it like that quick they've been in and out that's not the reason why we have that doctrine is to contrast the tree of life to make you realize no matter how good you think you are how much of the message you think you believe how long you've been in that you must be born again quick into life by the baptism oils that must happen he says can't you see he's that tree of life contrary to the surface seed you see he's that seed the woman seed the tree of life in the garden unless they put forth their hands and move this tree they'd eat the tree and live forever and he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever who are you feeding on in this last days what's given you power to rise above all these denominations and things his word is life and that be the word then the word of god which eve turned down in the garden of eden then here is christ the word made manifest the word she turned down the opportunity she had here is the opportunity again so he says and when he come on earth he was the tree of life do you believe that a rome what did they do they chopped it down and he was put on the tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on a tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth the bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden all glory to god that means the tree of life is here the opportunity that the woman missed you have the opportunity today and it means that somebody has taken the opportunity for him to say this that there's going to be the tree of life restored again that means somebody takes the opportunity by the same word and the same god made manifest and husband and wife the same bride tree back again notice making it known he brings forth the bright tree what's the bright tree the tree of life restored back to him again husband and wife to bring forth the fruit notice making it known how my there's just so much here we could just keep on going i'm reading still notice the tree of christ's body in the garden now making his mystery known to his bride watch redeemed by christ the second adam you believe he was going back home to eden with his fallen wife redeemed back home again that's christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery now god manifested in christ christ manifest in the church all together to bring back the original adam and eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and same spirit and everything else he says the anointed man now the anointed people he says oh my to bring back the anointed bride in the bridegroom anointed by accepting what eve turned down that means the time is here the time is now we have it's the season now the headship is here he's telling us by accepting what eve turned on and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept see how that hybrid condition again just exactly what he done eve he told eve don't you do this and don't you do that and you can do this and that and satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but in but the eve in the last days is not going to do it and i believe i read this uh just a few weeks ago why even the last days because remember she's not like you she's not that type of woman she's gonna but she's gonna be tested tested she's gonna come and contact it again by the same thing she's gonna be tried so it's not because she's not tried everything's the same he says but the eve and the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it because now that satan has acted to fulfill god's purpose and plan now god in the last days has ordained a woman not to fall yes sir god's going to do it he knows it he'll have it he said his church would be here without spot or recall she's going to stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest she is going to stand there in the splendor of him the tree of life restored again that's your that's what we are today is the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife let's stand to our feet the tree of life restored back to him in the beginning god created and in creation was his plan and purpose expressed in creation so once god was finished creating and had brought forth the woman he was even it's almost as if he was waiting right because he doesn't attack till the woman's come forth and now that the woman comes on the scene after six thousand years even after god's day of rest now in that age that could have been eternal in potential he's there and he comes and he tries to attack the woman why she represented the purpose of creation the potential of it the power of it she was a tree that there was going to be an appointed time in a season so satan's attack helps us to understand what we're doing today we are his and his alone and the truth of the original sin is so important the results of the original sin being in the surface it's so important to understand i know it's it's weird to some people and they try to pervert it and make it out to be you know they're the ones that claim we're being too literal with things and they're the ones that go too far on other i know there's a lot of criticism about it but the truth of it is beautiful i hope you can see yourself the beast at the beginning is the beast at the end same purpose same objective same goal but the bride at the beginning was hid in the tree of life but now in the end she comes forth let's bow our heads in a word of prayer i'm not sharing with you data i'm not merely just sharing with you facts it's not depth for depth's sake it's not types for type's sake i'm not trying to out-type somebody you bring out more in the book of genesis so someone can tell me later oh i've never heard that before i don't always take that as a compliment though it is complimentary at times the point is for us to value the word of god and to know we've been born again amen to know that you've been baptized into the body of christ by one spirit the holy spirit the baptist holy ghost is eternal life we're not just we we don't possess eternal life by merely claiming to have it we don't possess eternal life by merely accepting jesus christ as a savior it has to come by union and we take the time to walk through this and we're looking at it with such a weight and a heaviness in our hearts these things in the scripture it pondering it over and over we've got to come to a birth we've got to come to be new creatures in christ jesus and i know i may be narrowing the audience down with such a marvelous group such as this but i just challenge you today to search your heart and ask whether or not he's wooing you calling to you to surrender to him let us all purpose in our hearts to be the manifested truth heads bowed now let's just say a word of prayer gracious heavenly father lord i thank you for your presence that is with us for the assurance that your never failing presence is with us wherever we go therefore we should not fear to go anywhere or do anything i desire today lord that your people would know that you're with them that they could see your perseverance and your dedication and how that you've pursued us from the beginning that at no time in the record did you ever cast us off at no time in the record did you deviate from your purpose and your plan may we lord take great assurance by seeing so many loose ends tied up take such great assurance and seeing so many dots be connected lord i know the picture that it paints to the world is odd and scary and to some blasphemous but lord it makes scriptural sound sense to know why your son came the way that he did to know why it was blood that was shed upon the cross to know why he had to be resurrected for our our sakes it couldn't just merely be death but he had to come back again in life to share that life with us and then we can be partakers of that life and you see the whole record of the wheat plant even the bride tree being restored back again in these last days not just to stand there with leaves clapping in the gifts but there to be a season now when the headship comes and the fruit the fullness of the word is brought forth again the same seed that was in the beginning not just the day of pentecost but genesis 1 28 and it will be so lord that one day through the efforts of this bride that last seed will come forth and the earth's purpose will be satisfied and we'll go to meet you in the air my heart calls out to any seed that remains unexpressed and may we be the light that strikes the seed may we do our part in this valley together with our sister churches together with the other churches many all over arizona represented here today may we do our part because one day when that last seed comes forth to maturity immediately the harvest is finished and will meet you in the air and then shall be brought past the saying that death is swallowed up in victory what a wonderful time to be alive lord what an exciting time to be alive lord i found myself saying i don't mean any disrespect to those who've suffered lord i know i've suffered personally there's disappointments and hurts and heartaches and great loss lord and i know many have suffered to tremendous degrees but lord i just found myself feeling like this is the best year ever not because of economics not because of politics not because of science not because of sickness lord not because of health but because of the word your word proves true it's proven itself alive it's proven itself honest and sure and that we anchor our souls in this word we will not be moved from it lord not one iota lord i rebuke the enemy that still today tries to cause confusion on the promise may your bride receive clarity knowledge wisdom and revelation and may the intelligence that has come become her possession because you yourself have stepped into it this hour the intelligence is here she has the mind of christ and may she stand on her feet in the splendor of you we commit the people to you now father in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen if you have a personal way that you like to express thanksgiving feel free to do so if you have a personal way you like to express it don't let don't let the color of the walls hinder you there's a personal way if it's whisper if it's head bowed if it's arms raised just express yourself to him
