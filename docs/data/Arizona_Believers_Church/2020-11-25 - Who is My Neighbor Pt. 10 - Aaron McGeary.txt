TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Luke 10: 33-37 it says but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the tomorrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed Mercy on him then said Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise amen you may be seated we've been speaking on this subject for several Services now and I'd like to continue uh on it and trying to just pick up where we left off last Wednesday we weren't able to finish um the thought that was on our heart taking it from verse 33 and so we want to just continue uh and just pick right back up where we were and Jesus asked the question or the question is asked of Jesus in the beginning of this story who is my neighbor and that's the title that we've given this is who is my neighbor and we're asking ourselves This Is Us challenging ourselves by this Parable taking the word of God and examining Our Hearts by it the question is asked who is my neighbor but then Jesus when he takes it and he's he asks the question which one of these three was neighbor unto him uh who fell among Thieves he's asking the question who fulfilled the duty that one owes to a neighbor so it goes beyond who is my neighbor but also what is neighborly which one was neighbor to or acted toward towards this one who F fell among Thieves and we've been looking how that Jesus is really stripping away pretense and he's addressing hypocrisy by challenging the lawyer with the example of the Samaritan as the lawyer would have identified with the priest he would have identified with the levite him being a Jew would have not considered a Samaritan to be his neighbor but rather he's using the Samaritan then as kind of an abrasive example going to get right in the face of this this lawyer and these Jews and challenging him uh to strip away any kind of pretense uh to consider whether there be any kind of hypocrisy in his heart so in verse 33 we were just taking this word by word or phrase by phrase to identify how Jesus was framing this issue to get the lawyer's attention and ultimately to give us instruction we're not just a fly on thewall to the conversation between Jesus and this lawyer but rather there's something that's to be gained for us or something that's instructive to us ultimately this is what God wanted it to do he wanted it to impact us and make a difference to us as Believers so it says in Luke 10:33 but a certain Samaritan and so he uses this Example The Samaritan who would have been an antagonist to the Jews who had a lot of similarities to the Jews but a lot of differences to the Jews and there was a rivalry between them because the Samaritans being a mixed group of people of the of in the in of Assyrians and Babylonians and then they begin to mix uh through several Centuries with with Jews they were very unique people that believed in the law of Moses and worshiped and kept C certain days and they beli that they were keeping it in more of a pure way than the Jews were so for Jesus to use a Samaritan uh kind of would get the the ranker up and get the Jew say oh why would you use our rival why would you use them as an example and we used John chapter 4 of the discourse between the the woman at the well in Jesus Christ just to highlight how this the the interactions between the two would have been rare and and they weren't cordial to one another so Jesus is using the Samaritan to overcome really any objection on the lawyer's part and therefore any objection on our part any objection with respect to religion or national pride or Prejudice or experience where I had a bad experience with a Samaritan or I had a bad experience with the Jew and whatever it might be Jesus uses the Samaritan to drive home this point and we asked the question last time uh using this example of the Samaritan and the Jews where they hated each other and didn't like each other and a lot of it was because of what they had in common but ultimately it was because of what their differences were and I asked the question who are our Samaritans or the people we don't like because of our differences and it's kind of aggravated a little bit more because of our similarities but then we also pointed out and what was really the main emphasis is are we not the Samaritans should we not be those who identify with the Samaritan or at least say that Christ is challenging us as the Believers to be like the Samaritan don't be like the priest don't be like the levite certainly don't be like the lawyer but be like the Samaritan who looked past national identity looked past religious identity looked past Prejudice and and personal experience and he did that which was right and actually followed something that was in his heart which was aligned with the nature of Christ and so Jesus develops the Samaritan's character to teach us how to love our neighbors he uses the Samaritan as the example of how you can love your neighbor as yourself not just answer the question of who that is but also how that we can be neighborly to them so he says but a certain Samaritan in verse 33 as he journeyed and so the word choice that Jesus uses uh amplifies the uh the conduct now of the Samaritan it's it's dealing with it a little bit more poignantly it's it's putting it in a in a way that we can consider the actions from a different standpoint and so he's not just pointing out that the Samaritan was walking down the road he uses a phrase of the priest and the levite to suggest they just kind of were walking they were just traveling but Jesus says the Samaritan journeyed and this means it refers to his course of conduct so it was more than just a way that he went that day but rather it spoke of a way of thinking a way of feeling and a way of deciding that this is something he done had done purposely in his heart it wasn't just the path he was taking but it was the way that he was living that resulted in the conduct that he expresses here here so it's not just oh we happen to be going this way but we have to be living an appropriate way in order to do the right things in the way that we're going so when he says the Samaritan journeyed it's something that was a a manner of Life a course of conduct and so his actions reflected his Instinct his actions reflected his nature it wasn't that he had H uh was forcing himself to do something or had just read a book and was trying to do what the book said but rather this was a way of life that was something that was instinct to him and we should desire that the word become our first nature the nature by our first uh first birth is a contrary and against the mind of Christ but having been born again we have the Life of Christ on the inside of us that gives us another nature that we could yield ourselves to and in allowing the word to have preeminence what our desire is that nature become first nature that if we have an instinct that's carnal we have an instinct that's more accustomed with our last name or the nature we get from our parents or whatever it might be be we want the word to become our first nature and we do not want to just be following rules as a discipline like the levite and the priest were because when it would have mattered the most they didn't do it when the religion would have really meant something to somebody else they couldn't do it and so their religion was a lot of pretense their religion was a lot of put on it was a lot of show and they always acted a certain way and did a certain thing and prayed a certain way and were happy to perform service in the temple because everybody ooh look at the priest and the Levites assisting ooh look at the Levites and that when it when the lights were on the cameras were rolling that was when they wanted to act but that that discipline or that adherence to certain rules didn't really pay off for the Jew when he was laying in a ditch when it really would have counted and so we don't want to just be Christians when the lights are on lights camera action play the part and we really want to be a Christian when it really matters and we want to be the kind of Christians that make a difference in other people's lives CU think about it by the very fact that you are a Christian if you really genuinely are a Christian that means you are born again which means the Seal of God has come upon your soul and you are now a member of the body of Christ The Life of Christ is on the inside of you so that's what makes you a Christian is what he's done for you so in one sense there's really not more that he should do for you right you're a Christian your sins are forgiven you're Justified you're sealed into the body of Christ now a lot of my life I is as a Christian is what I can do for others as we identified early on in this that that is what eternal life is eternal life is living for others so we don't want to just be following rules no matter how well they're laid out or how well they're enforced but we want to live the life so it says but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and this is where we we left off last time came where he was he didn't just it wasn't just knowledgeable that this man was in in a in a difficult situation he was not just in proximity to where the damage was done but he became present in the man's need when it says he came where he was it was more than just uh recognizing that someone needed help it was more than just being a prox a proximity in geographical location or nearness in terms of space but he's now becoming present because he's going to become more aware of what the need is and more aware of how he can help him and so it was more than just to bless his heart you look at him and say oh man he is really in bad shape and he kind of says bless his heart and he sends out a tweet and says hey came across a guy in rough shape pray for him right it was more than that but as he came to where he was it's now working to a place to where he becomes present in this man's need he becomes more conscious of what has happened and it's more of I'll bless your heart it's more how can I help and so it says came where he was in the image that's painted by by these words is he came down to where he was he didn't just stand off from a distance looking down on him a a and assessing his situation and saying from up here I can tell that you're in bad shape and from up here I can tell that you're you're naked and from up here I can tell that you're half dead uh but rather he comes down to him and so we must recognize that this is an act of humility it's becoming more real to me that humility acts humility is not just something kind of an aura that we give off though some people give off anti-h humility but humility should be something that acts and humility is a funny thing as soon as you think you've got it you've lost it right so in that way humility is Elusive and so we should always be striving to be more humble and we should be striving uh to become more simple and and try to become more Christlike so this was an act of humility and this is how it I was seeing it last week and it's just got more more real to me or what I wanted to express to you last week has become even more uh real to me as I pondered it over the past week is he had no fear of becoming the servant becoming the servant was no threat to his position uh becoming the servant in this situation and coming down to where this man was there was no threat to his pride so whatever calculations he went through he arrives at a different conclusion than the priest and the levite whose Pride kept them from rendering Aid whose position kept them from rendering Aid and oh I got to be careful about this I got to be careful about that what would people think but he becoming the servant was no threat to who he was in other words he knew who he was wouldn't change by going down and helping this person he wasn't worried about what everyone else would say if he if he bent down and kneel down to render Aid to this man so he was willing to condescend come go down to where this person was as an act of humility and Jesus says in Matthew chap 23 verse 11 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant he that is greatest among you so he that is the greatest and this is number one this is the best th this is the one that everybody looks to this is the one that has a aund ranking in Madden this is the one that everyone aspires to be this is the goat it says but rather the greatest among you shall be your servant he just kind of turns it all the way around and when we really consider this and if we're really catching the truth of it it makes us uncomfortable that the really the really great ones are the ones that are servants and then we think oh in order for me really to be great in order for me to really be taking my place in the kingdom of God I've got to be a servant it begins to make us uncomfortable because we do not we do not want to be perceived as vulnerable we do not want to feel weak because we do not want to feel weak and we do not want to feel vulnerable or we do not want to be perceived as either either it makes us uncomfortable to put ourselves in the position of a servant because we think oh a servant that's somebody in a in a different place that's somebody in a different character that's someone of a lower station that the great ones are the ones that are served it's the it's the poor ones are the ones that are serving listen it's not so in the kingdom of God the great ones do the serving and if as Christians we have the spirit of Christ inside of us then the then we must also become the servants and I I think this really hits a a weakness in Christianity where pride and arrogance has got taken a hold of it and made it into something that it's really not and and painted a picture of it that's really not I I was hearing a minister here recently and one that was uh uh it was one that's kind of these uh it I'm trying to be very careful how I say this it wasn't a message Pastor or message Minister it was one of these high priests that are out there one of these Bible Church guys who who who you know have want to present themselves as very fashionable and and very woke this would be a woke pastor and uh he was trying to say that Jesus Jesus is somebody that everybody loves and Jesus is somebody Beautiful Jesus is somebody everyone gravitates to and you think well when I read my Bible it really wasn't that way there was no Beauty in him that we would desire him and in giving this uh this preacher the benefit of the doubt I could see that in reality uh the way that Christ lives and the way that he the way that he can draw upon a person's heart the truth of Christ is really what you want to be someone to be attracted to not what we make him out to be but we've in the same sense that we've made Christ into something is not Christians in doing so have become something very un Christlike something that's more Hollywood than it is Christ and so as this Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was this is an act of humility he was becoming the servant and Jesus says him that is the greatest among you let him be your servant and the reason of this as we know ultimately the act of this Samaritan was to serve and to minister to this person in need I want you to think of it this way power without humility at best is perceived a as as predatory at best is perceived as manipulative and controlling and abusive that's what it is at best at worst it is I want you to ponder that for a moment power without humility at worst is perceived as being predatory at worst it is when there's no humility joined with power power becomes uh manipulative it becomes controlling it becomes abusive so without humility all the power we have in Christ can be used in a way that is manipulative controlling abusive predatory this is how people in powerful positions get away with a lot of things and a lot of hurts and abuses a a and and criminal activity is because they don't have the humility joined with it and they manipulate and abuse and take advantage by reason of their power and we should never exercise the Liberty we have in Christ or the power we have in Christ through through Authority through position and through Advantage it says of Jesus in Philippians 2:7 speaking of Christ but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men here's Jesus Christ this is the mind that we're to have in us he made himself of no reputation and in making himself of no reputation it says he took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men the form that he takes on the light that he grows into he's the son of a carpenter and he is a carpenter he hasn't preceded some forth from some royalty or some lineage where everyone kind kind said wow look at this guy he has the right kind of last name and look at this guy he has the right kind of position he wasn't born within the pal to be associated with the King he wasn't born uh to the priesthood to be associated with the Levites he's born to a carpenter and as he grows he becomes a carpenter and so he takes upon himself the form of a servant a common man it says and he made of himself no reputation and and the phrase that's used there is he emptied himself and so what it speaks to is he laid aside his glory or he rather he did not appear in his glory and I want this to strike you the right way Jesus could have come in a way that declared his majesty and His glory could have come in a form where everyone's like wow this is him this is the one we all waited for and and it's as if if one coming where they dress a certain way and and if a captain's going to be among you and and there's a certain way that you see this is a captain I'm going to straighten myself up and I behave myself around this one who has authority Jesus laid aside his rank Jesus did not appear in his glory if I could put it this way he didn't Big Time us he he didn't he didn't show up saying uh do you know who I am do you know who I am uh you do you have any idea you should be doing this you should be doing that he came he laid aside his reputation he didn't Big Time us he didn't come in some kind of hot shot he wasn't bragging he wasn't showing off he wasn't uh trying to make people uh fear him because of his status but rather he laid aside his glory he laid aside his rank he became came in the form of a man now this is instructive to us I believe this is what the Samaritan did it was was an act of humility he doesn't try to make a name for himself he he bends down to render Aid not when the cameras are rolling not when everyone would see it not trying to create a viral moment but he's doing something when no one else would see it and he's doing it because he knows it'll make the difference in one person's life and Jesus made of himself of no reputation he says in brother Bram says in the message hear ye him he said I've had the privilege of meeting great men in my days been in King's palaces but when you really find a man that is a great man he makes you think that you are the great man if if there's some way that this could become a revelation to us and in doing so kind of knock out whatever that Gene is in our in our thinking that makes us so afraid to compliment somebody it makes us so afraid to say something good about somebody and and think about the reasons why we don't think why we withhold compliments and we withhold praise and why we can't rejoice when somebody else is blessed but when it says here brother says a great man when you find someone who really is great they'll make you think you're the great man even though they may be the greatest at it they're going to tell you you're doing awesome that's amazing I wish I could do that I wish I could be more like you and they don't have to feel like well that was good but guess look what I can do oh you're you're coming along real well but watch how I can do it but rather a real truly great man who knows he is great doesn't feel like he's got to prove himself to anyone so is loose then and has the Liberty to say hey that's awesome you're doing great and then make you think you're the great one he says but it's the man that just thinks he's a great man that wants to put on a whole lot put on airs big time you a name drop or or whatever it is to try to make you uh be an all of them he says he do have to put on a whole lot so there's no pretense to he doesn't need to have a lot of pretense he's not trying to wow you and blow you away with what he knows and how good he is brother R says the same thing he says it in a number of different places I'm just taking it from two places but in the same title hear ye him he said that's what makes him God to me is because that he is humility so what makes him great is the his ability to Humble himself what makes God great is the fact that he can condescend that this is what brother abam makes him God to me is because he is humility he's able to Humble himself that means he really is great listen if you if you really are nothing and lot of times people are just they're just poor and they're just pitiful and they mistake it for humility no you're just poor and pitiful it's not humility but he's saying if you really are great then you can truly exhibit humility so he said that's what makes him God to me is his humility I've had the privilege of doing much traveling and meeting great men when I meet man that tries to be great that's you can always class that man you can always recognize um his ilk or what he's like there isn't very much to him as he said there's one he's just one who's trying to put on a whole lot great man that that's they a great man or those or great man that's they try to make you think you're the great one if someone truly is a great one a great person then they're going to try to make you feel great he says but it's a man that wants to be great if you'll just Chase it down to the bottom you'll find out it's a stuffed shirt not much to them this is this this amplifies Jesus saying he that is greatest among you shall be your servant is going to be inspired to see that you can be benefited going to desire to see that you can be lifted up that you can be encouraged and not that you'd Pat somebody on the back when they're sinning and not that you would make somebody feel comfortable for doing things that are wrong but it's it's a way of living and acting to where it's not all about you not about how good you look and how what everybody thinks about you and whether or not you're proceed to be a Christian forget all about that just live the life and do the things that are right they're going to figure it out eventually but your desire is not to get a a gold star on your name on a chart but rather make somebody else feel that there's an opportunity for them to be redeemed and to be benefited by the very thing that's benefited you great man is those that try to make you feel think that you're great and I don't believe I believe if you really catch the heart of that it's not just someone trying to blow smoke or someone trying to uh puff you up through vanity but it's someone who actually cares for you and the scripture says he came where he was he came down to where he was he's saying I'm with you I'm here for you I'm concerned about you in Luke Chapter 14:1 it says for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased the Way Up Is Down whosoever exalt himself shall be abased he that humble himself shall be exalted self exaltation what is it always got something to prove it's that complex or that syndrome where you've always got to you got always got to make yourself stand out you got to make yourself kind of rise to the top you want everybody else to know what you're thinking and how you're feeling and there's certain ones that you got to be very very careful around because if you let tell them something they don't know then you're automatically wrong right and there's sometimes in situations that maybe more professionally than as a Christian where you realize listen this is the way the boss is you got to you got to present this in a way to where ultimately when you when you arrive at the decision he thinks it's his otherwise they're not going to want to do it so you got to approach somebody like that in a way to where the right thing is to do ABC the right thing is to do 1 plus 1 equals 2 but you can't just tell this person that's the right thing because if you present it to them and it's not their idea they don't want to have any any ownership of it what is it that's he that likes to be exalted always has something to do always has always has to prove himself B saying that man wants to put on a whole lot a man that wants to be great and if if you really think about it as brother BR says you if you run that chase that thing down you'll find it's a stuffed shirt it comes from a place of emptiness comes from a place of complex and insecurity where they're really not sure who they are in Christ and so they have there's a lot of putting on a lot of pretense that comes with it brother Bram said the spirit of God always the spirit of God always is ready for correction sweet humble willing talk about the spirit of God in you is always ready for correction sweet humble willing that's what the spirit of God is you say the spirit of God is always willing for correction listen if we get in our minds that we're right absolutely right and we can't be wrong and there's no way we can be wrong and and you get the and and you take some of the things that we believe in the word of God that we're Justified and that we cannot be deceived and we thought talk about our security if we take that and we sew a little bit of Leaven into it then it comes to a place where we can never be corrected we can always justify everything that we do we can always just uh come up with a way to say well I'm right I'm right I'm right I'm right I can't be wrong I can't be wrong I can't be wrong but the spirit of God is always ready for correction sweet humble willing and then just going to skip a little bit of the phrase and he says just remember arrogant Spirits are not of God whosoever exalteth himself shall be a based this is a lesson that we take from the Samaritan when Jesus says he came where he was this was an act of humility he's coming down to be present in the person's need he's letting them know I'm not afraid to be to to roll my sleeves up and try to help you I'm not afraid to do what I can to to minister to your need I'm not afraid of your situation your situation is going to take away my Christianity your situation is going to cause me to re think whether or not I really got the goods or whether or not I have faith but yet they're motivated they're willing to Humble themselves they're not afraid of their position they're not afraid of what other people may think about them they're willing to Humble themselves and in humbling themselves help somebody brother Bram says in the message washing jesus' feet he's talking about the Pharisee who put on the put on the party and invited everyone and Let Jesus just sit there with dirty feet he says we're watching this Pharisee and I can see him as he walks back and forth in the great corridors of his home I'm Dr so and so in this city you know I'm a well-respected citizen what I say is the Law and Order I'm a great man and when you get to thinking that in your heart then you're nothing that you ought to be says the Bible as it says in Galatians if a man think he's something when he's not when he ought not to he says when a man thinks he's just a little bit better than somebody else you're on your road out brother I I this is this isn't qualified when a man thinks he's just a little bit better than somebody else you're on your road out brother so we should never think that we're better than somebody else that's right we're all the same in the sight of God Rich poor brown black white yellow whatever we may be we're all on one equal basis with God so there ought not to be any self-righteousness there's no arrogance there's no pretense there's no put on and if we can get rid of that then there's no hypocrisy then we act authentically and it's a genuine response to things and we're really concerned about other people's needs because we're ask ourselves who is my neighbor in other or how can I how ought I love my neighbor as myself this may mean very little if we were just all living in the middle of nowhere and when we left here we all drove six hours in different directions and we lived on a 30 acre plot of land and we were 100 of miles away from society but think about it we live in a community of nearly six million people and and though there's uh maybe there's a lot more distance these days because working from home and distance educ doing school online and these things but we exist among a lot of people and we also live along among a very large Christian Community and we live also amongst a very large message believing community and we better know who our neighbor is and we better know how to love our neighbor or we won't be pres presenting Christ the correct way and the wor of is it will actually be giving the message a bad name within the a community of people which call themselves The Message and also within the community of people that call themselves Christians and then within the larger Community as a whole we do not want to profane and bring any reproach to this gospel amen therefore we ought not to think that we're just a little bit better than somebody else but notice when Jesus said he that is the greatest among you shall be your servant notice what he does here in John Chapter 13 I only had verse four and five but I want to read verse three notice what precedes this tremendous AC of humility Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God now if you could just kind of let that sink in I know that all things have been given into my hands I come from God and I go to God now if you had that Revelation right now what would be your first act what would be the first thing you would do right now you're just sitting here you're in you're in the Camel Back Room here the Marriott 2029 Whispering Wind or something like that I'm getting all my ww's weeping willow Whispering Wind they all kind of run together but here you are you're sitting in the room and all of a sudden you get this Revelation and God tells you I've given you all power everything's been given put into your hands you came from God perfect Revelation you come from God and you're going back to God what's your first act what do you do you sit there and you start going yes yes yes I'm gonna I'm G to get what I want I'm gonna get to do what I want what would be your first act well let's take a cue from verse four Jesus says he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments took a towel and girded himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was garded this is his first act by one who knows all power is his the First Act by one he come knows he comes from God he goes back to God and the first thing he does is he actually lays aside his garments he doesn't say this is the reveal guys hey guess what this is who I've been all along you guys didn't really know he does it's he actually wants to take that this his humility to a deeper level why because he that is greatest among you let let him be your servant so his first act as the one who is all things have given been given to him all power in Heaven and Earth has been given to him listen this ought to be instructed to us to those of us who've received in this last day a revelation that takes us back to the beginning in places the title deed of redemption into our hands where we become the final voice to the final age and the Final Act of redemption is going to be lived out through your bodies we've got to have this kind of nature this kind of disposition or that act is never going to take place amen kind of walking around saying who wants to benefit from my third pole Revelation you need something let me speak it for you and we're just kind of walking around listen you're never going to get to the place where things are going to be spoken into creation you'll never get that place by lifting yourself up you only get to that place by bending yourself down amen it'll only be through acts of humility that this bride will ultimately come to the place where that kind of power is free to be exercised through her he laid aside His Garment he's becoming bare before them takes a towel and GDs himself pours water into a basin and becomes what they would have called at that time a just a footwash flunky and we all we all wear Nice Kicks came tonight with our church Yeezys on we have Darn Tough socks on our feet smell good and we have $250 pair of shoes on and we walk on sidewalks and we all get pedicures and our feet are nice right we all have nice soft feet these guys wore sandals and walked on roads that weren't driven on by Teslas but you had animals and dust so what would their feet be collecting it would have been a pretty thing so sometimes that we can make this feet washing one another's feet so sterile where our biggest problem we wash one another's feet is foot length we're like oh my goodness his brother didn't bother cleaning between his toes and the the water's all cloudy now but think about what these feet would have looked like here's Jesus pouring water into a basin and when you read this it's easy because the order of communion is sometimes lost in scripture where they they we think that the communion was first and then he washed one another's feet but that would have that would it's actually scripturally he first washed their feet and then they would have taken the meal later so there's somebody in this group that he knows is going to betray him he's the one that has sold him out and when he came to that one he didn't say next he knelt before the one that betrayed him and washed his feet what did Brother Brown tell us live for the one that hates you live for the one that would kill you if he could Jesus did it laid aside His Garment so much that we could amplify in the wording that's painted within this scripture but let's just paint the picture in our minds if we were as we are here gathered in the in a room like this if everyone was seated and one had laid aside their garments and so they they're putting aside their clothing and here maybe just in their undergarments they take a towel and gird themselves so there's no way to tell there would be no way to tell what this man's station would be or what his rank would be by virtue of him shedding his clothing he's now just in a common undergarment he takes his towel and GDs himself there's some that even paint the picture that he might be very near naked he puts a towel on him and then he begins to kneel before these men and he begins to wash their feet paint the picture not as we have the Lord's supper and we have the picture of the last supper and everyone's kind of leaning in and you see everybody in their places but now paint the picture where there's a man on his knees washing somebody's dirty feet and then ask yourself when you walk in the room who's the greatest here when you look at that picture say now which one is the master which one is the servant which one in this picture is the the least the carnal eyes would look at the say well this guy's obviously the servant he's actually the poorest of amongst them he's probably does even belong here he's just washing their feet he's soon going to take his leave because these people must be important the ones that are sitting waiting for their feet to be washed and this one who's washing the feet he must be the least and we would have it completely backwards when you look at that picture who's the one that's loving his neighbor as himself who's the one that's being neighborly Jesus didn't concern himself with the Optics like I'm the greatest and if somebody walks in I mean I know These Guys these 12 know who I am but what if someone walks in what are they going to think if I'm washing somebody's feet they're going to have this picture all backwards he wasn't worried about Optics neither was a Samaritan his goal was fulfilling all righteousness that's why he could come to the the Jordan to be baptized in humble himself to the prophet to be baptized when John said there's one coming amongst you whose shoes I'm not even worthy to unloose his shoes I'm not even worthy to do it and Jesus and we can say this is true in reality he's greater he's one greater than John but when he comes to John John said I have need for you to baptize me there's the right kind of humility there's the right kind of attitude in light of the greatness of Christ but Jesus says no suffer not to be so I have need to be baptized of you just using my own phrasing and just as much as John suffered himself to baptized Jesus Jesus is suffering himself to be baptized by John and he's yielding himself and submitting himself to the prophet and unless we lay aside our self-righteousness and in laying that aside put on genuine humility will never be effective will never be effective there's there's been so much of me wanting to connect this to the reality of this end time and rapturing faith and there's been some scriptures we used in the beginning that I wanted to kind of Branch off of and used at the beginning of this uh these sermons on who is my neighbor to Branch off of to show that the bride's maturity and the bride's coming to a place of climactic power is not through the way that we think it's going to happen in know from a worldly standpoint a worldly view it's how the third pool gets twisted up where it becomes something that's completely not but you'll find that there's got to be humility there's got to be submission and there has to be a total dependence upon God to fulfill his word from start to finish otherwise it's never going to happen and if we're presuming if we're acting arrogantly if we're not walking in humility and if there's not acts of humility in our lives then we're not coming to that place and drawing near to the image that's going to speak and be the final voice to the final age unless we lay aside self-righteousness genuinely put on humility our Christianity the power that we have in this word of God is not fully effective and and I I there is this was I was debating it or or mulling over it to be a sermon in itself but too many Christians are just plain mean and I'm not making any distinction amongst the uh denominations and non- denominations just people who name the name of Christ they could be just plain mean and they could be so arrogant towards others especially if they disagree if I if I knew if I was under the impression and that we both agreed then I can be kind to you I can be nice to you as soon as you find out there's a difference everything changes and it's amazing just how mean people who name the name of Christ can be and just how arrogant and spiteful they can be towards people that they have a difference with and it really is a shame and so I had been collecting uh tweets and different things I come across that uh indicate kind of the impression that Christians give others and I want to show this tweet here brother John if you can put this up I if you can see this this was a tweet I removed the handle so that nobody would go try to find who this guy was and follow him I don't know what else he believes or follows but being a server the past three years I can say without a shadow of doubt that the Sunday after church crowd people who folks who went to church is full of the rudest most self-entitled and most ignorant people to ever walk this Earth and you find this isn't just an outlier you'll find a lot of people that work in the in the restaurant industry that feel exactly the same way so there's a lot of reply replies to the tweets that said and the worst tippers too and and just as you Ponder this and you continue just to look at this tweet how someone could make the claim that in their in their time of serving people it's not the drunk crowd on a Friday night it's the people who've just left church show up at a restaurant and they're the ones complaining and they're the ones that feel self-entitled and they're the ones that are rude and they're the ones that are ignorant and arrogant and this is the experience of a lot of people is there anybody here that want to say Amen to that I mean anybody that's worked in the service industry has probably experienced this it's the church folks that have the worst reputation and treat people the worst and what does it relate to and I just want to use some phrases here that maybe just get us thinking but it's our orientation towards others it's our attitude towards others that's really manifesting itself and listen people know when you look down on them and if you're being condescending but not condescending not being condescending down to them you're being condescending there's a difference if you're being condescending to them they know they know when you're looking down at them they know when you're talking down to them and you're never going to you help somebody by looking down on them patting them on the head you poor little Heathen and the problem is with a lot of people who name the name of Christ they're more concerned with being right than they are with being Christlike they're more concerned with being right than they are with being Christ and when that happens we value our reputation more than we do the testimony of Christ we value our reputation more than we value his testimony there's a difference between your rest uh your your reputation and your testimony and we're too busy building our own reputation and because we're so busy building a reputation we can never have a testimony because the testimony is his it's what he's doing through you but you got so much of yourself out front you're not building a testimony you're building a reputation and you wonder why people say the things they do about you or feel the way they feel about you listen if you feel like I'm preaching to you I am preaching to you but we should all take it very personal Lord don't let me become that crabby cranky arrogant ignorant rude self-entitled Christian being a server for three years taught him that Christians who just went to church are the wor first I mean didn't say hey it's a Saturday night they hadn't been in church since Wednesday night I get it it's it's rough it's kind of a crazy crowd here that a little bit irritable no they just went to church they just got filled up they just got taught you know love your neighbor as yourself be kind humble yourself and they went and then they leave and they go to the restaurant and they belittle people humiliate them talk down to them and then notice this next piece of viral material this is a receipt has the amount a tip which had been added in already maybe it was a party over eight but it's an 18% tip they put a zero and then they carry down the total amount remove the tip put the same amount so they give them zero for a tip now what kind of hether reprobate would do that somebody who says I give God 10% why do you get 18 and says Pastor they sign it Pastor Lois Bell or I don't know how they say their name exactly this is like this is really amazing to me I mean I could get it if they kind of forgot who they were for a moment didn't know they were a Christian but they're actually using God and their title to take somebody who's just served them at a restaurant and say I give God 10% why should I give you 18 and then wants to kind of reinforce it so we realize this guy this this person knows what they're talking about Pastor so that you read that and go silly me why did I ever why did I even think to put a tip on there I should have comped their meal and chase them down sorry I didn't know you were Christian your meal I comped your meal here's the new receipt it's zeroed out but does this not reflect the attitude that some people have yes and of course afterwards it's just a lapse of judgment and I will go take sensitivity training classes and I will learn not to be you know be little servers but never truly getting to the core of what caused that kind of attitude to begin with all right enough tweets for one night verse 33 but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was we're just taking a step further now and when he saw him what does it mean when he saw him it's a it's through this process as he journeyed this manner of life this conduct way of thinking a way of feeling a way of deciding he came where he was this is an act of humility he's humbling himself and once he humbles himself he can see him he can really recognize the severity of the situation he can really appreciate what's truly happened he can recognize realize truly what his condition is and until we take the risk of lowering ourselves until we take the risk of condescending we'll never see correctly you'll always see it from the wrong angle you'll always see it just a little bit skewed but you got to allow these veils of pride and arrogance which distort our view of what we're looking at we got to let those things Fall Away the veil of pride and arrogance will just distort our view and if we can let those Fall Away we can truly see the need in someone's life and then truly render service came where he was and when he saw him's not he's not looking at him incorrectly he's not judging him he's not putting him in a particular category deeming whether or not he's worthy of Mercy deeming whether or not he's worthy of Grace but he sees him says in Matthew Chapter 5 and Luke chapter 6 two different verses to make the same point blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy the merciful are those that have mercy on one who is Afflicted to help one Afflicted or seeking Aid to bring help to one who is wretched so it takes the ability to recognize that one is Afflicted that one needs Aid and that one is wretched but also the capacity to render it it's one thing to look at somebody say oh boy they need Jesus and another thing to be the very vessel through which Jesus comes it's easy to recognize somebody who's in need but do you have the ability and the capacity to render the aid and to give the mercy when someone needs it blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy then Luke Chapter 6:36 be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful you notice how this is almost akin to Matthew I think it's 548 where it says be therefore perfect even as your heavenly Father which in your heavenly father is perfect your father which is in heaven is perfect so we're told to be perfect is is your god father in Heaven is perfect but we're also told to be merciful as your father is also merciful this is an attribute of his Perfection if you believe that you're perfect but it's it's weighed in arrogance or it's weighted with arrogance and it's expressed arrogance that is not Perfection because the father's Perfection embodies a a desire to be merciful be ye therefore merciful Have Mercy On The Afflicted render Aid to those who need it bring help to The Wretched be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful otherwise you cannot be perfect as your father is perfect it's a very conclusion that this lawyer came to in Luke 10:37 well which one was neighbored to him who fell among Thieves he said the one that showed Mercy on him which is kindness towards the miserable and The Afflicted joined with the desire to help them kindness towards the miserable with a desire to help them a certain Samaritan as he journe came where he was and because he's gone through this pattern gone through these steps came to where he was there he could see him and once he recognizes what he needs he's merciful because he's not only willing to see him as needy but willing to give him what he needs if you could somehow look at the picture that I've been trying to paint through this almost an hour or so tonight of an act of humility and humbling ourselves and in getting rid of uh ignorance and being rude and self-entitled and I give God 10% why could I should I give you 18% get rid of all those mechanisms that create those kind of attitudes self-entitlement you owe it to me you don't you know who I am uh kind of mentality or this attitude of arrogance and get lifted up which we could go back and say where does this come from why does that why does that happen that way a place of emptiness being a stuffed shirt always trying to be a put on but if we know we're great then there's your opportunity to let that server on a Sunday think that they're great because we want to talk down to them I can't believe you're working on Sunday not realizing kind of like the Paradox of that comment or the even the hypocrisy of it like well you're here eating like if you just go home I wouldn't need to be here braah but if you could just think about it I wanted to read this statement at the end of last service and I I felt it just um there's two more statements I want to read and I wanted to read them at the end so I brought them to the end now because I think it's kind of climactic and it we can just view what's happening in these statements better through kind of walking through the scripture this way brother Abraham's praying at the end of a service and there's a Democrat president in office and he's got what he deserved heart attack right uhhuh you feel me like he's a Democrat he deserves it he's getting what he wants I mean could you just imagine if Obama had a heart attack you know all the Christians you know that dancing in the streets burning mattresses in West Virginia and couches in Ohio but notice what really happens here's brother Baron praying our heavenly father we are standing in a desperate need for the leader of our nation our president he may never know this Lord but you know it I pray for brother Johnson as he professes to be a believer in you now what did what what was the requirement for brother brandham to call Lyndon B Johnson he was a Texan so maybe you could call him brother just upon that basis but he said he calls him brother Johnson as he professes to be a believer in you now he said this is a desperate need and father a heart attack we understand has struck him I pray God spare his life we're in a national crisis right now anyhow let thy Spirit come upon him Lord and right now in the hospital wherever he may be let your spirit come down to that Walter Reed hospital and touch his body sparing his life Lord now you want to talk about somebody who Journeys lives a certain way has a certain way of thinking feeling and deciding who can come where someone is and see him when he saw him here's brother bandam who's been able to Humble himself and condescend and even though I would say this Prophet was greater than the president he's using a language to give respect to this man and he said the man's Under Pressure more pressure than what we understand so we pray God as Believers and as a part of this nation we pray for our leader that you will grant him an extension of life in this great hour could you pray for someone you wouldn't vote for could you or would you immediately begin to think well wait a minute if he has a heart attack is there a way to rewind this is there a way to are we all praying that something happens to Biden that maybe if something happens to him before the election certified then maybe there's a way we can kind of squeeze in another four years of trump this is a challenge to our biases a challenge challenge to our attitudes we're more concerned about we value our reputation more than we do our testimony or his testimony we're more concerned about being right than we are about being Christlike and here's a point where brother Brandon may have differed politically may have voted differently but he recognized this is not a time for politics I'm going to pray for our president brother Johnson the man's Under Pressure more than what we understand this is an empathy brother brandham could understand and he's going to say God spare his life and I want to take it one step further in verse 33 but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him he felt pity for him his compassion was the result of his willingness to Humble himself so it it can't even be unlocked it can't even be loosed from a a position of arrogance looking down on someone but because he came to where he was and saw him as he was his compassion could then be free and often we lack compassion because we lack perspective we can't have passion because we're unwilling to gain the perspective we're not willing to see it for what it is we're not willing to put ourselves in position to really hear something out see it for the what it really is put ourselves in a place where maybe hear this person out let's listen to what they have to say let's truly understand what happened here I I wrote it down one time I tried to find it I had it in my Bible I used to carry it with me and it had so struck me one time this this phrase what can I learn from you no matter who it is what can I learn from you not always just thinking well I've got the answers I got the answers I got but what can I learn from you and often as I said a moment ago we lack compassion because we do not have perspective and we're really unwilling to even gain the perspective humble ourselves to the place where we get beneath somebody and from that Vantage Point go oh wait a minute I know what's wrong now I I would like to amplify this further later if we could but we know that compassion is to do the will of God and true compassion will never lead us to violate God's word true compassion will never lead us to compromise God's word true compassion will never cause us to den Den God's word true compassion will never otherwise cause us to reject the word of God therefore we ought not to be afraid of true compassion if we can gain perspective and be led by the Holy Spirit uh uh showing compassion to somebody will not be exhibited in denying the word of God or denying truth or rejecting truth or living contrary to the word of God compassion is to do the will of God if but if we're not willing to gain perspective and put ourselves in position to have compassion then we'll never do the will of God God as it says in verse 34 and he went to him notice just how it then UNF flows but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him came to where he was saw him as he was then could come to him think of just how beautiful that is came to where he was saw him as he was therefore he could come to him now he was ready to serve now he was present fully aware fully there to where he could render the aid and there he bound his wounds and poured in the oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him this is an individual responsibility of a Christian we all have a responsibility as Christians to to take care of those who need to be taken care of he came to where he was he saw him as he was but now he could come to him takes it a step closer and now he's in a position to help him brother Mike if you could come we'll close the service with this statement it's a very powerful statement as we read how brother brandham prayed for brother Johnson he said as he professes to be a believer as we're trying to look at this the attitude and the conduct of this Good Samaritan in light of the attitude of the Jew Jews towards him in light of the politics that would have dictated that this would not be the right thing to do in light of all the different things that we could could be expressed here we could talk about try to take it all now as a full picture listen to what brother bradam says he says you know what a blessing is do something for somebody else I thought a blessing was something I got right but you know what a blessing is it's do something for somebody else that's right and if you have a neighbor or somebody that's done you Injustice who's my neighbor and not just who's my neighbor how do I love my neighbor if you have a neighbor somebody that's done you an injustice now I'm not asking you to think of that person right now necessarily but maybe some of you have already thought of that person he says remember this for me don't never turn him down somebody's hurt you somebody who's harmed you somebody who's been a Shyer to you somebody that you feel has done something very somebody who's done something like a Judas to you brother BR says remember this for me don't never turn him down and he says take him to God in prayer and see what a different attitude you'll have now the picture he paints here is so profound to me if you're sincere in prayer you stand shoulder toosh shoulder with him though he's done you wrong Injustice but you just take that man to [Music] God and stand there in the presence of the father one time and say father my neighbor has done me wrong but I guess watch when you go to telling his wrong it'll not only help him but it help you also he prefaces this by saying you know what a blessing is do something for somebody else if somebody's done you an injustice don't ever turn him down take him to God In Prayer see what a different attitude you'll have so now take him in prayer notice the picture that brother BR paints if you're sincere in your prayer you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him though he's done you wrong Injustice but you just take that man to God and stand there in the presence of the father sometimes say father my neighbor has done me wrong and the picture he paints is that you would actually go before God in prayer and you would bring this person up who's done you wrong and you would stand there with them in the presence of God and put your arm around him and stand shoulder toosh shoulder before God and say God this brother has done me wrong this man has done me wrong and now you've brought him into the presence of God to tell God what he has done to you and in telling God standing shoulder to- shoulder with him with your arm around him cuz what have you done you haven't left him laying in the ditch yeah you haven't left him out there in Leo to Sea you haven't left him in sin you haven't left him in the house of ill-repute you haven't left him as some kind of Shyer some kind of shady friend somebody who's done you wrong but you actually have taken him and taken him with you to prayer and said he's just as worthy to stand before you as I am amen and said Lord I'm going to I'm here with my my neighbor and he's done me wrong he says you go to talking about what he's done wrong as you stand there in the presence of God shoulder Tosh shoulder all of a sudden you begin to see him differently and all a sudden you begin to realize the things that makes him that way the reason why he did that you maybe begin to give them the benefit of the doubt you begin to op recognize the influences that are working on you say oh he did this to me he did that to me and Lord I realize he's had a rough life he's been rejected he's been abused he's got a lot of scars he got a lot of complex oh Lord forgive him I know he doesn't understand what he's doing and he's just taking it out on me Lord I know he doesn't really mean it Lord have mercy on Lord I take back all that Justice I declared upon him Lord all that mean things I said all the things I wanted to haveen to oh Lord maybe maybe I can make a difference for him yes he says it not only will help him but it'll help you also he says you'll see what he's been through in the Temptations and things it'll change your attitude towards that brother and it'll help him also you always are doing good when you're praying one for the other we may not be able to as this Samaritan did jump into a pit and bind wounds and pour in oil and wine and set them on a beast and bring them to an end and take care of we may not be able to do a lot of the things that get all the headlines the active things the Hands-On things but you can pray and you can take people who've offended you people who hurt you and you can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in the presence of God and begin to pray even about what they've done to you but he says but as you do it it'll change your attitude towards that brother because you'll see what he's been through in Temptations and things it'll not only help him but it'll help you also I want that kind of [Music] attitude that's the kind of attitude I want to have tonight Lord that's my prayer let me have this kind of instinct then they have this kind of nature Lord change my orientation towards others change my attitude towards others let me not value reputation more than the testimony of Christ let me not be so concerned about being right that I leave being Christlike will be much more effective there might be people you've been witnessing to hoping that they'll change you start looking at what you've done you think man I'd be kind of arrogant humble yourself to them and tell them you've been arrogant and say you know what I'm sorry I forgive me I've been kind of talking down to you and you know what I'm no better than you can we start over [Music] again and like we said last time you don't just talk about somebody if they like hunting talk about hunting just waiting for the next opportunity to talk about water baptism talk to them in a way to where they realize you do care you actually do care you actually are concerned and and this is a sincerity on your part that it's not like those people who who are just kind of pedaling to you some product they want you to sign up and they show a whole lot of interest in you and they're there for you and they're interested I want to help you I want you get out debt I want you to do this for you I want to do that for you come on all you need to do is sign up it's just $500 I'll help you get your downline built up come on we're in this together and as soon as you say you know what I'm just not interested I'm not really a multi-level marketing kind of guy I was they're gone well you're never going to get out of debt and I knew you were like that oh what what what happened I thought you loved me I thought you cared for me I thought you were concerned about me I hope that your challenge take these quotes take them seriously find them print them out Ponder them consider them it's great instruction to us let's stand to our [Music] feet is that change my heart oh God change my heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like sing that again change my heart oh God change my heart oh [Music] God make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you you are the part you are the part I in the [Music] clay hold me and make me this is what I pray change my heart heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like can you sing it one more time change my heart oh God change my heart heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you you are the Potter lift your hands to him yield to his clay oh you are the part I Am The Clay mold me and make me this is what I pray change my heart oh God God make it ever true change my heart oh [Music] God may I be like you let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer let's just be sincere before him I realize these series of services are uh challenging maybe in some ways to some people they might think that they're shallow but I believe they're they're they're very deep in that it gets to the real core of things the real heart of things and if I could just speak personally to you tonight you are you are handling the most powerful word there is and you have been blessed with the greatest Revelation that the church has been given you stand on the precipice of a body change the privilege and opportunity to exercise the greater faith and the greatest Faith that's ever been given to the Christian Church the seed of Faith which was swn on the day of Pentecost is now going to come to its Perfection to manifest a full and complete uh Redemption and fulfillment ment of a body like unto his the plan of God the Plan of Redemption is f is brought to finality in The Bride of his choosing now if that's this is the reality of the word that we walk in and and if that's if that's what we're facing as Believers if that's the place we're coming to as Believers listen that responsibility can only be handled through humility we we talk about applying the token we talk speaking the word we talk about power and power power where's the humility Jesus overcame by the word and humility we could claim that we love the word with all our minds and all our soul and all our heart but don't love our neighbor as oursel we claim to love God whom we have not seen and hate our brother whom we have seen maybe it seems to be Elementary but I say it's foundational to the point to this perfect house cannot stand without it and this bride that God's been building Through the Ages is going to stand upon these types of principles that Christ laid down and so tonight it's my prayer Lord make these things sure in my life let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord as we close the service we're Desiring Lord that you would seal these things in our hearts as only you can that is by Revelation Lord take the real me need of it the real heart of it the real truth of it and I trust that that is what you've done is you've imparted it to us Lord beyond my mannerisms and even beyond my emphasis Lord May something have penetrated the heart to awaken a desire to be more like you Lord may it give us hope that as Christians as we desire to see others saved and as we desire to serve that if there has been a a lack of success as it was or if there has been a an inability to be effective there's no doubt that these things are corrective Lord to give us hope that it's not there's not something wrong with the word but there's just something wrong with the the presentation there's something wrong with the cart there's something wrong with the way that we're presented it I pray Lord you'd help us to be better ambassadors of this word better Bears of your presence season our speech with Grace Lord temper our tongues father sweeten our Spirits may we take these words which we've read tonight may they become instructions and guidelines to us Lord to walk according to these things not merely out of discipline but because Revelation quickens it gives life to these things to be used in our own flesh to be used in our own lives pray for all that are here Lord may you touch them may you bless them may you encourage them may you be with us Lord I pray grant us a Happy Thanksgiving may we be safe with our family amilies may we may not be able to gather like we would want to these are not normal circumstances Lord but may your presence be near to those who may seem alone families unable to gather with other family even members of this body who may not be in fellowship with ones tomorrow may they not feel alone Lord may we even have in our hearts to reach out to one another say I'm with you is there something I can do for you may not be able to come see you may not be able to be there by your side but Lord may they know we're with them maybe we sense the closeness to these this this time lord bring us together on Sunday to Fellowship once again around your word pray your blessings upon your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
