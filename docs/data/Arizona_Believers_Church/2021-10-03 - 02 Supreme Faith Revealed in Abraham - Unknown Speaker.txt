TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and continuing on the second part of supreme Faith revealed in Abraham and I don't know that I often would say this and it's not monetized or anything but I if you didn't hear the first part on Wednesday night I would encourage you um to go back and listen to that those of us here at our home Church um to listen to that as we trust that we'll probably be on this subject for a little bit uh but we began on uh Wednesday night on the subject of supreme Faith revealed in Abraham and I'd like just to go a step further in the subject and maybe in saying a step further we're kind of coming back and beginning to look at Abraham's life in its be in the beginning where the scripture identifies him but um I think that first part would really help kind of Orient Us in terms of what my burden and vision is for this subject so uh we begin here in Genesis chapter 12 veres 1 to4 now the Lord had said notice how it kind of is telling us what had already happened previously now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I'll bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoke unto him and lot with with him and Abram was 70 and5 years old when he departed out of heran and you can be seated we used a statement in the last few service Services where brother bham is speaking of a supreme faith and he says to have that kind of Faith you have to know perfectly what you were doing and then he in describing perfectly knowing what you're doing instead of him kind of zeroing in on being able to figure out all the Mysteries and all the types in the scripture or having a perfect understanding of all Divine Mysteries and shadows and types throughout the Bible he begins to talk about acts of faith how that you say you're going to go home tonight um and that is an Act of Faith or I'm going to meet someone tomorrow that's an Act of Faith and he said that the faith in God that's the way the things of God are you trust him and then you watch him do so many things until trusting him in watching him do what he said he would do he says becomes a regular routine and so he talks about how the rap is going to be the regular routine of following the scriptures and the pl the plans of God the Rapture is going to be the process of the F regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of God and so that was kind of something that we were using um as a basis for this supreme Faith revealed in Abraham so if we think about it that way Supreme faith is going to come from a regular routine of following the word of God and the will of God and so we think rapturing Faith while that's got to be something pretty incredible and and far-reaching but it's just going to be the regular routine of following the word of God and the will of God for our lives and so it's going to be on a daily basis acts of faith uh and as we have these daily acts of faith it grows our faith into a perfect rapturing faith and so the process of coming to uh uh receiving and manifesting or expressing rapturing faith we have to look at as just a daily life before the Lord daily acts of faith and it's just the these daily acts of faith you're building rapturing faith and and we can't even look at it in terms of you see a picture maybe of someone who's a bodybuilder somebody who wants to uh have large muscles well they got that way through a very a process and there's really no shortcuts in the in the plan of God where we can just inject a solution into our spiritual muscles and they're going to get very full and very and big and very showy it's got to be daily acts of faith that are developing your faith into a rapturing faith and so there's no convention coming up where there's going to be a Saturday night prayer line that's going to inject into you some sort of uh Solution that's going to give you really big Burly Faith muscles that's going to come through daily following the routine of the scripture and in your daily routine if it brings you through a prayer line then it's going to have the effect of increasing your faith piece by piece and so rapturing Faith or we might even use the term perfect faith and supreme Faith as we're using that um nomencl your Supreme faith can seem to be very mysterious and in being mysterious it can as we talked about Wednesday night it can be unreachable um and then some ways even seem impossible when we start putting uh rapturing faith and perfect faith in these different categories or viewing it from different perspectives but as I looked at the life of Abraham and was just reading in the Bible uh in in Genesis chapter 12 and just reading through the subsequent chapters something began to stand out to me about the example of Abraham when we think about him now he's Legend we think about the faith of Abraham we think oh Abraham the fa the father of our faith and he's such a he's such an incredible example and looms so large as this luminary of Faith but really if we look at the example of Abraham faith can be made so practical we begin to look at it to where faith is so practical that it just from walking daily in the plan of God and the word of God our faith becomes Supreme faith that just by following the word of God that's what manifests the supernatural we don't go on the hunt for a supernatural experience we just live according to the word of God and the supernatural happens and so that's what really struck me is this supreme Faith revealed in Abraham that in his life his life unfolds what our faith is as children of God that we can look to his life and his example and see how our faith as the children of God is going to unfold brother Brandon makes this statement in the unconditional Covenant that God made with the people Abraham was the example what all he was going to do to Abraham he was going to do to him and his seed and when he says to his seed he's not just talking about the natural seed through Isaac or even ishmail but what God did to Abraham he's also going to do with his Royal seed to the children of God so Abraham is the example and the message influence he says he was showing an example of what he was going to do in the last days as God dealt with Abraham in Genesis Chapter 18 as he made himself known to him he said he was giving an example of what he was going to do in the last days so what God did to Abraham he does to his seed what God did to Abraham in Genesis 18 he's going to do in the last days and then brother branam in referring to him offering up Isaac and being willing to offer up Isaac upon an altar he says in one day when God seen that his servant was determined to be an example for people of today it's it's then that Abraham's Faith the scripture tells us reached its Supreme expression and it was fully developed and mature when Abraham set forth to uh to take the life of Isaac in obedience to God's command it's then that God realized his servant was determined to be an example of people today I do not believe that brother bam is suggesting that Abraham thought oh I want to be an example for people in 2021 but rather he had a determined faith and that he was determined uh uh um to obey the will of God and he had certain convictions and certain Revelations and certain understandings and it was Abraham's Revelation and I want you to ponder this very deeply maybe in instead of me just saying it right now as my heart is overwhelmed with it maybe just for you to think about it what what are some of the characteristics of that act where Abraham was willing to offer up Isaac upon an altar that spoke of an end time Faith why why was it he determined to be an example he was determined to be an example for people of today what was it about his act then that would actually testify of the kind of faith that we would have now just ponder that a little bit so I want to look today at the Genesis of Abraham's faith and if you're sharp you'll notice I said today so I didn't just say this morning so you could you could be under suspense that perhaps this service will continue to noon but and then I want to look at the Genesis of Abraham's faith and where it began and where the Bible chooses to pick up the story of Abraham we'll refer to him as Abraham even though the Bible calls him Abram uh in these first few chapters of his life that's recorded here in Genesis but I want to look at the beginning of his the calling for him because our faith has an origin and there's a place where our faith begins but more importantly not only does it have an origin but it has a Destiny and as we begin to look at Abraham's Faith we'll recognize that there's a spot where God begins with him but in God beginning dealing with Abraham at the Genesis at the beginning it's not just uh you know something that was for the moment but it was forward-looking there was something that gave Abraham this expectation where he was looking for something and so our faith has a beginning but it also it looks to Destiny it's something we're looking forward to and I I want to identify in this way our faith has a beginning and it's in seed form and it has certain characteristics but in that faith is the potential of perfect faith and so there's something Supreme and full and perfect about the faith that we've received and in 1 Corinthians chapter 15: 19 Paul says if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable there's something about the faith of Abra that was forward looking to where it wasn't just what was happening that day that gave Abraham all his satisfaction and his joy and his peace and and a sense of uh uh worth and and well-being it was something about the future that uh made Abraham who he was and made him the father of our faith and so it's I think it's important for us as Believers to realize that the faith that we have looks beyond this life and that what we're living for is more than just a funeral with all the pews completely packed in a lot of nice things to say about us we're not living for a headstone or gravestone as it were we're living for a Rapture we're living for a change and we're so confident in that that even if we were to go by way of death we know that we're coming up in a resurrection and so there's no defeat in death there's no fear of the afterlife and so if we in this life only have hope in Christ we are the most miserable people so the fact that we're the happiest is in that we have hope in Christ in an afterlife this is part of the faith of Abraham and we're looking at the Genesis of his faith it says in Hebrews 11: 8 to10 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went now in com this I had meant to say at the outset it was nice to see brother Reggie and his family here today and I wanted to just Express Thanks for the service he ministered a couple weeks ago I was tremendously blessed and then having the Hebrew scholer here today I'm a little bit nervous about going into the book of Hebrews I I can I'm anxious to kind of hear how the Lord has dealt with him on these scriptures but I enjoyed what was ministered on Wednesday night it blessed me so so much and I wanted to say that when I saw him and his family here today that I appreciated that service that he ministered on choice but notice here as it says by faith Abraham when he was called out to go into a place which he should after Reed for an inheritance obeyed and went out so we can look at it in retrospect and say he ultimately was showed different things and and God unfolded things as he went but he went out not knowing whether he went but he knew there was something coming he knew there was a place that was going to be shown to him he knew there was a an ultimate this says by faith he solded in the land of promise now in a land of promise but as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise but notice for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God even though Abraham lived within the geographical location of the land that was promised to him and he lived in the land of promise he lived as if he was a stranger even dwelling intense with Isaac and Jacob those who are heirs with him in the promise why is it he seemed to be such a stranger in that land because he was looking for a city to come he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God that had foundations and wasn't transitory and wasn't tense and wasn't subject to Invasion and droughts and and changing in in the weather he was was looking for something permanent so Abraham's Faith was characterized of being forward-looking he had a vision he had something he was always looking to and if we look at this statement he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance when he was called to go out into a place if we look in Genesis CH 12 this is when he was called or this is the first reference we see of him being called specific explicit reference and so Abraham's faith and this is where we can identify with this and and I would even go so far as I say this might be my emphasis for the remainder of the service is that Abraham's Faith began when God called him that's the that's the beginning of Faith this is the beginning of faith is not as we are raised to believe something and we begin to learn about the faith of our parents and then we adopt that Faith as our Paradigm for the way of viewing the scripture a way of viewing life or discipline to approach Healthy Living from a a spiritual perspective our mental well-being but rather our faith begins when God calls us we have that word come to us and so this calling is at the core of true faith and when we begin to as this is my desire in looking at this and just maybe with a group like this we're only bringing these things back to your remembrance because you already know them but by looking at how Abraham's Faith began when God called him I think in looking at even the few things we'll see today we can relate to Abraham more than we think because again as I mentioned before even this morning he's such a legend when it comes to Faith that we don't we just don't readily identify with him we think about the acts of faith and the things that he did and the way God revealed himself and these visitations of the Lord to Abraham and we're just thinking wow you know he's the father of Faith but he's like an idol that we're always just looking up to and always admiring but we can never be it but no he is the he is the father of the faith and then we are of the same faith so there's something about his example that should speak to us to identify the faith that we have so Abraham's Faith begins when God calls him in Genesis 12:1 now the Lord had said unto Abram so this the way that this is structured is and we'll come back to Genesis chap 11 just to kind of see how this uh the why it's ordered this way but it kind of just it's going to describe some incidences that's taking place in Abraham's life but then it gives us this background that God had spoke to Abram and when God spoke to Abram he says get thee out of thy country notice these different stages get out of your your country from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee so he's saying leave and as you leave and as you depart I'm going to show you where you're going so he asked Abraham to begin a journey without knowing where he was going and there's a saying that if you don't know where you're going any road will get you there but Abraham didn't uh he may not have known where he was going but he knew there was only one place that God was going to lead him there was an ultimate so he said but this is how you have to start I'm going to show you where you're going to be I'm going to show you where I'm leading you but there were certain things he had to do he had to get out of his country first and and this is where I want you to identify with the faith of Abraham when we when we got born again we didn't understand everything all at once and I was like iy I got born again last night I've got rapturing faith I'm just ready to do all sorts of uh powerful mil Miracles and I understand every scripture and I know exactly the date in the moment when my body's going to be changed those aren't that's not what happened when you were born again but there's things that take place and things that have to transpire Before The Next Step can uh come forward before God can bless and God can manifest and God can do things so he got out of his country but then he had to get away from family extended family and then he had to get away from as the Bible says here from his father's house there was a separation that begins to take place unto a land that I will show thee so in Genesis chapter 11 we'll start with verse 27 it says this and now these are the generations of tah tah begat Abram nahor and heran and heran begat lot so these are brothers Abram neor and heran and then heran has a son lot that's where lot is the one that we see with Abraham later and haran died before his father Tara in the land of his Nativity in ER of the cdes so here they are in ER of the caldes this is the land where they are and then being in the cdes there's a lot of assumptions that we could make about them being in cdes and then being Moon worshippers and worshippers of Idols I we know that it's commonly believed and we're taught that Abraham and his family were Idol worshippers and in being Idol worshippers I want you to think about this particular aspect about worshiping an idol is they would they would have these images that represented a deity so something that they could see they could worship the god of the Moon and they could see the moon they could worship the god of the sun and they could see the Sun and so the images of the moon the images of the sun something that could strike the eye the appearance could they could worship that or they would fashion themselves idols and they would become graven images that they would worship and so something they could see something they could experience with their senses and something that could never speak back to them but yet they believed in some deity or some life related to it so Abraham's life begins in ER of the Cales he's there with his father and his brothers his brother dies and then Joshua and Joshua 24:2 describes him this way and Joshua said unto all the people thus sayith the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even Tara the father of Abraham and the father of Nar and they served other gods so Joshua and this is really the one place where we have this very explicit reference to Abraham's family being Idol worshippers but notice now they're in ER of the cald this is where they live this is where Abraham's F father's house is this is where his Kindred is and this is his country so these verses identified the country that God was going to call Abraham out of the Kindred that he had to get away from and the father's house he had to separate from and before he could come into the country that God would show him and it's in this condition that God speaks to Abraham and says get thee out of thy country come out of ir the caldes come away from thy Kindred come away from thy father's house that serve these other gods it says on the other side of the flood it was located in this other region this other place H uh east of the promised land where he would ultimately arrive and so this is the beginning of Abraham's faith we see that he's mentioned with his father and his brothers and it says that the uh Haron dies before his brother dies uh in the land of his Nativity and it's there that we know that God spoke to him because in Genesis chap 15 15:7 notice this and I've just going to these Great Links to identify these things in scripture because as I begin to read it I said well the Lord had said and it's like well when did he actually speak to him and well who was it that moved out of ER and who was moving and I know it's the Bible if you look at all these references in the Bible it tells this beautiful picture of how God dealt with Abraham in Genesis 15:7 and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of er of the caldes to give thee this land to inherit so it's God that brought Abraham out of Earth as we read we're going to read here in a moment and I'm reading these first because when we read the the instance in Genesis chap 11 it's maybe not clear But as God speaks to Abraham and these things are written down he says I'm the one that brought thee out of Earth to give thee this land to inherit so it's this land it was called a Promised Land why because he was going to inherit that land it was a Promised Land because it was promised to him and it spoke of a future your promise so when we think about the faith of Abraham he says I'm going to call you Abraham had to believe God and by faith he's going to souljour and go into a place that he should after receive for a promise there's something where his faith begins but there's also a destiny of his faith this future promise this future land there's certain things that he promised Abraham that he wasn't seeing immediately in his life and Nehemiah chapter 9:7 Thou Art the Lord the the Lord The God Who did US choose Abram and broughtest him forth out of ir the caldes and gavest him the name of Abraham so God chose Abraham brought him out of her the caldes and gave him the name Abraham it's God's choosing God's the one that brought him out of her in Acts 7: 2 to 4 and he said men and Brethren fathers hearken here Stephen speaking this the god of Glory appeared unto our Father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia so when we read it it says now the Lord had said unto Abram and it seems that maybe a very uh there might be certain things that we begin to think about wow what was that like and how did God make his himself known to him and how did he speak to him Stephen describes as the glory of God appearing unto him when he's in Mesopotamia when he's in the herb the caldes God speaks to him before he dwelt in Kanan and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and come into the land which I shall show thee then came he out of the land of the calans and dwelt in heran from then when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein you now dwell so notice how the scripture gets into these details of how that God speaks to Abraham the glory of the Lord appearing to Abraham he's in Earth the cdes and Mesopotamia then he goes to haran or haran as it says in in Acts chapter 7 and then from there he comes down into Canaan now with that is the background and we read Genesis 11 we'll start with verse 29 and Abra Abram and nahor took them wives the name of Abram's wife was Sarah and the name of nahor's wife was milka the daughter of Heron the father of milka and the father of isca but Sarah was Barren she had no child very remarkable details at the beginning here of describing Abraham and Tara took Abram his son and lot the son of heran his son's son and Sarah his daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and they went forth with from IR the Cales to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto heran and dwelt there and the days of Tara were 205 years and Tara died in haran so now we read that it's a little bit different than how we read it in Genesis 15 and Acts chapter 7 and these other places if we're just reading this it sounds like Tara took his sons a a and his grandson and they're going to go off and he's going to take them and move them to another place but even though the Bible say says it was Tara that took his sons and took his family it was God that called Abram and it was the glory of the Lord appearing to Abram that was going to cause them to move and this is why they're moving but because although i' say it this way although God spoke to Abraham Tara being the father is honored as the one that is the leader but why are they moving because God appeared to Abraham listen there's ways that we can look at our lives and we can see that there's a lot of people that have said and done things and there's a lot of movements and a lot of movement of certain people a lot of things that have taken place and it may seem well this person was the leader and this person was making the decision and this person did this and that person did that but it's all because God has spoke to you and Tara took his family and moved H and moved to Haron but it was God that spoke to Abraham and Abraham's like hey I've got to move I've got to get out of my country it was the rest of the family that went with them but the promise was to Abram and the rest of the family may have followed Abraham's like hey this is not a family thing this isn't a kindred thing this isn't a a country thing this is something I've got to do in my own personal faith and conviction and it says to they left to go into the land of Canaan so that's where he was ultimately going but they stopped and they dwell in heran for a few years the days of Tera were 205 years and Tara died in heran and so chapter 11 ends with them in haran or Corinthians says Kuran kurran about halfway between ER where they came from in Canaan there's different maps you can look at to see how they would had traveled and moved but that's where chapter 11 ends so when we read in chapter 11 that terod took his family and moved from ER to heran it's God calling Abraham and the glory of the Lord appearing to Abraham that causes the move as it says in Genesis 12 ver1 we'll read it again now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee notice these different elements the Lord had said unto Abram Acts chapter 7 uh Genesis chapter 15 these different places that we can read in the Bible show us that God appeared to Abram and his message to Abrams you need to leave ER and there's going to be a land I need to show you but as you leave ER you've got to separate from your Kindred you got to separate from your family as you read this and I I don't want to encourage maybe speculation but I think it would be fair to assume that there were no doubt many things that are hidden in this passage says and the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country Steph says that it was the god of Glory that appeared Under Our Father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia and he says that I am the Lord that brought the out of her and there's these different things that are taking place in Abraham's life as it's described and yet we don't know the exact moment that God begin to speak to him don't know the exact day that he left but perhaps hidden In this passage are many days if not years of prayer maybe there's months of seeking and meditation and pondering of this one that has spoken to him where he's just there working and he feels this unction and this presence and this power comes and something speaks him says I want you to leave IR the Cales and I want you to go to a place that I'll show you and just follow me and he's like what was that I've never had the moon speak to me before never had these graven images speak to me before but the revelation of God to Abraham must have been a process must have been a way that God was dealing with his heart to get his attention and bring him to this conviction and this Faith but regardless of the passage of time whether it was in just a single instance or maybe through multiple instances as we're pondering there came a time when Abraham was convinced of God convinced of this voice that was speaking to him convinced of this a glory that was appearing to him convinced of this one that was saying Hey I want you to leave ER the CES so well there was this premonition there was this Spirit there was this voice there was this one talking to me well was it the moon God was it the Sun God was it the god of the uh of the camel what which God was it well it was just a voice it was an unction it was a presence it was a spirit that spoke to me and told me to leave my country to leave my Kindred to leave my father's house and to go to a land that he would show me after there was some point where Abraham became convinced of this voice there was some moment where he became convinced of this dealing within his heart and became convinced of this calling that he had to leave his country leave his Kindred and ultimately leave his father's house and then Abraham's obedience unfolded stage by stage as he left ER the cdes as he came to Haron separated from his Kindred and then ultimately separated from his father's house as we continue to read in Genesis CH 12 God's going to establish a new nation and this is uh this is what I was been pondering this week to to a tremendous depths in my heart that as Abraham is being called and he's going to establish a new nation the entire identity of this nation is linked to God no other identity it's not linked to terara it's not linked to haran it's not linked to ER it's not linked to the CIS there's not a geographical marker right when we say the children of Israel we're we're not talking about a geographical location we're talking about a a children of a man Israel and so it's tracing back to somebody and to when we begin to talk about um the children of Israel they even refer to their God the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob so there are people that are identified and linked God's going to establish a new nation and this nation's identity is going to be singularly wrapped up in God that that's their that's their identity says in Genesis 12: 2 and 3 and I'll make of thee a great Nation when he says he's going to make of him a great nation this nation is going to be identified by this belief in this one that begin to talk to Abram think about it the whole world is groping in darkness this is shortly after the this is after uh the flood and after the Tower of Babel and everyone's being scattered all over the Earth and it's a time of great immigration and everyone's leaving of necessity to go to conquer lands and they're and they're and they're Gathering their tribes and they're huddling around their their languages and around their family identities and everyone has their deities and everyone has their worships and Men mankind are spreading all over the Earth and God says Abram his nextdoor neighbor could have said hey someone spoke to me today and I'm going to be selling widgets and I was told that I need to paint my coat purple and there's a lot of people that might have been hearing voices a lot of people that had a lot of ideas and a lot of different religions and all of a sudden there's this one guy among Millions says hey someone spoke to me okay you're next I God spoke to me and I had this person speak to me and this person spoke to me but there's one man that says I had someone speak to me well what do you call this one I he's I call him God the god of what I he's he's just the one that spoke to me and told me to leave IR the cdis and he's going to show me later where he wants me to be it's I may be putting in terms that are strange but that's the way the scripture says it one day Abraham got a premonition had a voice had a feeling had a something speak to him and make an appearance to him says I want you to leave where you're leaving and I want you to start I want you to get away from your family I want you separate from this person separate from that person and leave where you are and I'll show you later where going and if that begin to happen and we saw someone tweet this out or post it on Instagram or or or or they they called us and told us what they're about to do said are you sure you're doing the right thing you sure this isn't a scam you're getting took oh we we've heard how these things end well that's what Abraham looks like when you start to identify this man in the middle of nowhere all of a sudden saying I've been told by a deity by some Voice by some Feeling by some presence to do these things he says I'll make of thee a great nation Abraham is going to have an identity linked to one man God or one person God I will make of thee a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great this is God speaking these things and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee now everything is revolving around this choosing of God and making of This Nation and in the shall all families of the earth be blessed that'd be quite the brag at the brother Brother's coffee the next morning right Abram shows up with his brothers and everyone and says hey guess what in me every single family in Earth is going to be blessed like wow what kind of world are you living in or what you know who's all going to be left but it says all families of the Earth are going to be blessed and this one man named Abram at the time and I'm going to make of thee a great nation a nation whose origin is going to be the origin of this nation it's Genesis and its beginning is not geographical not even bloodline anything its origin is it's not bloodline because that would have then pertained to his father and his brothers and some of them maybe being half Brothers this origin now is going to be faith in God that's the origin the identity the birth of this nation and in Genesis CH 14: 13 it's the first time we ever see this this Appalachian mentioned and there came one that had escaped and told Abram at the time when lot is uh C captured and told Abram the Hebrew now they're called the Hebrew children they're called Hebrews and that's a name that we associate with the children of Israel but Abram has this identity as he a Hebrew Abram the Hebrew might have been the name that he was given amongst those in the region and Hebrew means one who has crossed over one from Beyond and there's a lot of speculation and commentary as to wow it would have been he would have been beyond the river and he would have been beyond this region and he was not there loc located there in this land of Canaan he was not a a local person wasn't indigenous to this region and so they looked at him as one who came from Eber one that came from another place and listen whatever the atmology was he's given this name Hebrew because there was something about his nature and character that represented somebody that was from Beyond he's a Hebrew one who' crossed over he had crossed over a particular way of thinking he' crossed over from idolatry he'd crossed over from a faith of the senses he'd crossed over from SE taste touch feel smell and hear and Imagination conscience memory reason and affection he' crossed over from these senses of body and spirit and he crossed into another realm of faith and he was no longer of the region and the realm and the belief and the convictions of everybody else in Earth he was one man who had crossed over into a faith in God he was a Hebrew Abram the Hebrew there's a deeper meaning that God intended by that phrase Hebrew we talk about the book of Hebrews we're not just talking about people who are their genealogy can trace back to Abraham but we're talking about people who've crossed over right crossed over out of tradition crossed over dead faiths and dead ideologies and crossed into this New and Living Way this life of faith and notice what it says in Galatians 3: 29 and if ye be christs then are ye Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise this is the nation this great nation that God was going to make through Abram it's through Christ that all the families of the Earth are blessed and he said if we are Christ then we are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise he says Abraham's seed seed is that which contains the germ you are Abraham's seed you are not Believers in Abraham and you are not Abraham ites or Israelites or the children of Israel but you are Abraham's seed and if you're Abraham's seed then you have that which contains the germ so what we're what we're wanting to do in looking at Supreme Faith revealed in Abraham is recognize our spiritual DNA so much talk about 23 and me and trying to figure out uh uh you know what our DNA is and who our family members are and where we come from I thought about on Christmas to to my extended family giving away DNA kits and trying to see which one's the serial killer when they get all nervous and don't want anybody else to you know turn in their DNA because they're going to get outed or something like that but there's all this trying to figure out you know what's in my DNA who am I related to and who does this you know where do I come from and what percentages from this region what percentage from that region if we could if we even just spend 10 minutes trying to think about what our natural lineage and geology and our family tree and there's some people that dedicate their entire lives trying to go back to the place where they're family began and if we'll spend even an hour weeks or months or dedicate our whole lives to a natural family tree how much more ought we to commit to wanting to know what my spiritual Legacy is what my spiritual family tree is and if I'm a Seed of Abraham I want to know what's in that DNA I want to identify the special characteristics of this great nation because there's something that's being passed from him from this great name from these blessings that's not merely related to Natural seed alone because we begin to look at the Seed of Abraham you find well it wasn't just every Seed of Abraham because it wasn't just going to be through Isaac but then it had to be Isaac through Jacob and you see that this this narrowing down it's a spiritual thing and there's been a there was came I I have pulled dozens and dozens of quotations that refer to this but I'm wanting you to see if we are Abraham's seed to be begin to identify so personally with this I'm just going to use a couple statements maybe a few come back to this thing to this uh this thought process at the end but in the message faith brother Ram says now we're speaking tonight upon faith and I thought it would be nice maybe if we could use this great character of Abraham for an example of Faith because it was to Abraham the promise was given and you are Abraham's seed and airs according to the promise so if you're heirs to the same promise wow let's look at Abraham right because we're Heirs of the same promise and the promise was given to him and we're hirs to the same promise and he's the example of Faith so there's a there's something that's being Express this faith is being revealed in Abraham says and we'll kind of review the life of Abraham just a little because he was an outstanding character now let's look at how how what made him outstanding and he was a man who believed God and now he had no great background to believe God because it's commonly believed that he was from a family of idolators he came down from Babylon his family dwelt in the land of Cala the city of er The Valleys of shinar and was just an ordinary man he wasn't an angel he was just a man like you and I we begin to think about Abram when he's called this Abraham the father Abraham the father of our faith and we be Abraham's seed this Legend This luminary this one that seems to be so large in our minds about faith and perfect faith and rapturing faith and supreme Faith he was just a man like you and I he says an ordinary man and what made him outstanding was he's a man that believed God not just one that believed in a God or believed in a deity but there's something very real about the faith of Abraham in the message Jehovah Gyra and again you'll find dozens of instances where brother bam calls Abraham an ordinary man an ordinary man an ordinary man but let's really think about that when he says he's an ordinary man Abraham was just an ordinary man he wasn't any different from any of us just the same now you want to know how particular this is we think well Abraham was a Jew well no he wasn't there were no Jews yet you say well he's a Hebrew but really in a spiritual sense because he's one that had crossed over he's just another Gentile another one of Nations and tongues that had populated the whole Earth that had come over from the descendants of ham sham and japeth and here he is and they can trace this lineage back uh uh as we do in the Bible but really at that point when you look at all the lineages of all the people and all the families on the face of the Earth there's not anything that sticks out about Abrams over anyone else's but yet God chose that God chose to narrow it down by Genesis CH 11 to one man Abram and he says he's just the same as us people today and this is where I chose this statement because he begins to identify he he's amplifying what he means by he's an ordinary man he's just the same as you and I because you don't want to make him out to be such a particular peculiar great uh gifted and talented and unique person to where we don't ever feel like we can identify with him and and as this has impacted me while I've been studying this I thought we have a very difficult time relating Jesus to Jesus Christ and and it's often we try to this disconnect between Jesus Christ and ourselves I mean it's it's by the fact that he's born of a virgin he knew no sin he's the son of God he didn't bypass his theophany he speaks face to face to God he never did no sin and we look at this example of Jesus Christ and we're like well I struck out at Birth right the the very fact that I was born of a woman I can never be Jesus Christ but yet somehow we are asked to be perfect as our Heavenly Father which is in heaven is perfect and we're asked to be Christlike and and we want to come into the image of Christ and the image of Christ is being molded in us and there's this disconnect between being Christ being like Christ that that the connection is made through the new birth and through our justification but that's if we just say this that's a that's a challenge in itself but now when we begin to look at Abraham we can begin to say now now that this is what I want you to be able to do now that I can do that I can believe God I can do that and it was through that faith that Christ came so you're never going to be Christ until you can believe like Abraham and through that Faith Christ will come and so we're making Abraham human so that our faith can become superhuman we're making a we're looking at the life of Abraham so we realize so you mean you're telling me that I don't act actually have to create squirrels to go on the Rapture I don't have to speak in tongues to know I got the Holy Ghost I don't have to do all these it's this isn't the way that it's going to be and this isn't what adoption is about and this isn't Oh you mean I just have to do what Abraham did because once we start looking at Abraham believed God and just followed in the routine of trusting God and that's the life that I have to live because he says people today when they see God put a gift in the church some people tries to stand that person up as some great big outstanding something well that's wrong wrong couldn't we say the same thing about brother brandham he says you got your mind on the person then instead of on the Christ we are all just the same the Bible said that Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he just had the same ups and downs that we have think about Abraham we're Abraham's just like us he has ups and downs not he says now my people formerly are Catholic you all know that and they're great on holy man holy man that runs in the family saying but to me it's not holy man it's holy God that's right it's God is the object We Are Men all the same brother Brandon went to Great Links to try to challenge us not to make the mistake even about him the prophet the one who fulfilled these scriptures of Malachi 4 and even the angel of Revelations 10:7 and the angel to leod deia that he was a man like like we were and you realize it's people that try to go they try to put a man on a pedestal and make him a holy man and this is what the Catholic Church did Jesus Christ was not only born of Immaculate Conception but so was Mary because they get so far and to try to make they get so caught up in this holy man this holy man ideology to where oh brother brandham has the same kind of Mythology regarding his birth and even his children have this mythology regarding their births why because they want to make it about the man and not about Christ and so when we look at AB Abraham we're not making it about Abraham we're making about the God that Abraham supremely trusted we all have the same ups and downs he says God is the object we We're Men all the same but Abraham was just an ordinary man came down from Babylon and he dwelt there in the land of Shar and perhaps his diet was go in of the morning and pick some berries from the bushes and go back out and kill an animal and have his noon Day meal and some more berries for supper and so forth must have been during the spring or summer or the when the weather's good but here's he's saying this is his life let's find out about Abraham what kind of man he was he fast he got up and prayed six hours to start his day fasted for another six hours ate a cracker and drank some water because he was spiritually in tuned to God and didn't want anything to get in the way of his connectedness to the father this deity that speaks to him it's probably because he lived a life that was just the normal everyday life getting up in the morning having breakfast hunting his next meal eating dinner going to bed just this regular routine that God could come and visit him and speak to him wasn't trying to make himself different you know he wasn't the shaman of er always claiming that God spoke to him and always claiming this and always having claims on that he say he's saying this is Abraham he's just just an ordinary man living an ordinary life going about doing ordinary things every day and while Abraham being just an ordinary man God chose Abraham by election just by living an ordinary life doing ordinary things it's being an ordinary man that God met him in the extraordinary it's just living an ordinary life where a natural day turned into something very Supernatural and what did it nothing's magical about the berries they didn't cause a hallucination he didn't get some meat that was a little bit too gy God just chose him by election he didn't get into some kind of Saki or some kind of barri or something that could cause him to hallucinate and he's having this wild dream in his teepee no God chose him by election not because he was different from any other man but it was cuz that God's election has to stand sure I hope you can identify more easily with Abraham today than you ever have before just an ordinary man going about doing ordinary things and you know why Abraham's Legacy endures today the reason why Abraham's Legacy endures to this moment is because God manifested himself to him we don't have we don't know any I me from the moment that it gets to Abram really everyone else is lost to the story Into The Narrative unless a Seed of Abraham crosses paths with him I mean just think about the rest of the Bible the rest of the Bible it it doesn't have like this cutscene to North America and says meanwhile the great great great great great great great great great grandfather Sitting Bull is is you know settling in Lakota for the first time ever and just kind of gives us this cut scene so we can see what's happening on the other side of the Earth the only way we'd ever hear about Sitting Bull's uh family is if one of them came across Paul or one of them came across the king whose name starts with a J right that's the only way it would have happened it has to have something to do with Abraham's family if they're going to make it into the story so what was it what makes Abraham so extraordinary God manifest himself to him and this is the sign the significance of the life of Abraham is singular this is a very simple thing I'm just trying to drive home this morning what made his life so significant is faith in one God faith in the one true God faith in the god of creation that the very God who spoke worlds into existence came and then spoke to one man Abram and made himself known to him the world is worshiping deities the world is believing God the world at one time built a tower to try to avoid the judgments of God but yet now Abraham has this claim and what makes Abraham significant it's very very singular this is what we have to identify in this faith of Abraham its Genesis was Abraham believed in God and the God that he believed in was the god of creation the god of Eternity the one true God the singular God not three Gods Not the multiplicity of Gods Not gods in creation but the god of creation it was true faith in the one true God the Bible says in Genesis 12:4 and so Abraham departed God spoke to him an ordinary man just living an ordinary life eating berries in the morning having a meat for lunch berries in the evening going to do the same thing the next day and God speaks to him it says so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him he's believing in this Lord it says lot went with him and Abram was 70 and 5 years old when he Departed out of herent he departed as the Lord had spoke to him I want us to think here it's 11:17 and I i' I've just come to the spot I really want to focus on laser focus on now for a moment and I'm wanting you to in your hearts just search your hearts because the significance of the circumstances in these verses cannot be overstated really can't because if if the importance of Revelation to the True Believer can never be overemphasized then really what we're talking about is the revelation of God personally to Abraham and in such quiet Simplicity when we look at these scriptures if we start with Genesis chap 11 these are the generations of Tara and we see how that he has a son named Abram and Abram Mar Sarah his half sister and then we see this we see these these things unfold a and we see these um the the his his life unfold it's just in this quiet Simplicity that an obedient Faith unfolds that influences all Humanity we mentioned it Wednesday night 60% of the world believes that Abraham is the father of their faith 60% of the world over 4 billion people saying our Father Abraham and I know that's Christian and Muslims for the most part but they believe they're going back to this one guy that lot maybe the rest of the world you know 40% of the world thinks is mythology doesn't even think is real but this is how large this character is and when we go back and look at his life and it's preserved for us that we believe by faith these elements are preserved for our faith it's in such quiet Simplicity that obedient faith is being expressed look at this look read the story you read in Genesis chapter 11 you read it in chapter 12 you even read it in Chapter 13 and maybe when you get to 14 maybe there's finally some kind of significant clamor that may speak to how great Abraham was but there's no outstanding events in his life that would make him this Mighty Hunter this great General this tremendous leader there's no events of War there's no disclosure of some kind of wealth that make him stand out doesn't say that he was the mightiest hunter in the land it doesn't say that he was the wealthiest man in the land there's no no land that he lived in that seemed to have any particular significance where he's of a particular Kingdom there's no armies there's no laws associated with him there's no science that he discovered there's no Arts that he did there's nothing else associated with his name think even now if we go back and we say now how are we going to Let's identify what Abra made Abraham great it's not his armies it's not his contributions to science it's not his contributions to the Arts they can't even find artifacts of his of him and himself everything about Abraham there's nothing else ass associated with his name except one thing faith in God Abraham's life is wrapped up in one thing that God had personally revealed himself to Abraham and he obeyed at the end of the day that's all that this can come down to this is all that we can look at in the beginning say well it wasn't because Abraham had a strategic was in a very strategic location that was important to a lot of other nations and so he had to bolster his armies and he had to fortify himself against Invaders because he had the most fertile land and because he had this or because his family was that there's not an accumulation of wealth there's not an accumulation of armies there's not an accumulation of any kind of events or or accomplishments that make Abraham stand out when the Bible says God called Abram he's an ordinary Man without any extraordinary accomplishments and what made him special is God's election I hope you can identify with Abraham a little bit more easily today and Abraham as it says as the Lord had spoke to him he departed and went out he journeyed towards Canaan in obedience to the word and faith in the promise and I come across this it's a lengthy statement from a commentary I was reading last week and I'm just going to go ahead and read it to you because it just is written so beautifully and It quotes Genesis 121 get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House un a land that I will show thee this was God's first revelation of himself to Abraham up to this time Abraham to all appearance had no knowledge of any God but the deities worship by his father in Cala now he finds within himself impulses which he cannot resist in which he is conscious he ought not to resist he believes it to be his duty to adopt a course which may look foolish in which he can recogn and and which he can justify only by saying that his conscience bids him are you are you hearing the way that this writer is able to summarize the faith of Abraham I think it's so important for us to recognize this element of the faith of Abraham especially in a time when the whole world is trying to build a case that you're crazy and trying to undermine your faith and listen if you have the faith of Abraham strip everything away prove that the King James Bible was written by Shakespeare prove that this happened prove that that happened and at the end of the day you say you know what I know what it's like to be like Abraham because I'm driven by an Impulse on the inside of me to believe a voice that's speaking to me he finds within himself impulses which he cannot resist and which he is conscious he ought not to resist he believes it is to be his duty to adopt a course which may look foolish and which he can justify only by saying that his conscience bids him he recognizes apparently for the first time that through his conscience there speaks to him a God who is supreme in dependence on this God he gathered his possessions together and departed could you just imagine what it would look like that day when he packed could you imagine what the conversations may have been like with this family dad God spoke to me was dad's like which one what did he say are you going to have to sacrifice a son and you don't have one so you want to borrow one of mine what you know what what do you need no God spoke to me and told me to leave this country and to travel and he's and he's and he has this conviction and Dad I I have to follow him I I I'm convinced and he's packing up his possessions and his whole family is getting to leave the land of their Nativity the place that they were born the place where they had their identity even a place of Sorrow even as a son who had died H uh his brother had died there terara his father's son heran had died Tara his son heran had died and now he's packing together all his possessions and he's departing why because God spoke to him and told him to do it faith in the word moved Abraham not family think about this the faith of Abraham we being Abraham's seed this is what moves and motivates Abraham not family not wealth not curiosity he wasn't like the first Columbus let's go find out what's on the other side let's just travel let's explore and it wasn't the sense of expiration it wasn't the sense of adventure it wasn't his family it wasn't wealth it wasn't curiosity it wasn't fame or popularity wasn't invited to go do something and be a part of something there wasn't this you know some came by with a telegram and said there's gold in them Hills and he left chasing after gold in the hills of Canaan no there it was nothing like that for Abraham for Abraham when we read Genesis 12:4 so Abram departed it was the first step in a lifelong adherence to that spiritual Supreme that had spoke to him first step and him obeying this supreme de God a God who is supreme that in his as this writer says it's his conscience but it's something in his faith deep inside of him it's the F the first time when it says he departed he's now stepping out in a life that would be characterized as obeying this one who is supreme Abram is not moved by famine Abram is not moved by War he's not moved by politics he's not moved by pretense he's not moved by popularity he's not moved by personality all these different things that cause Abraham to move are not any of these natural things but he's under the influence get this the influence of an unseen God he wasn't following a star he wasn't traveling the circuit of a comet he was not chasing the Horizon of a Setting Sun he is now being moved and influenced by an unseen God to even make this even more outstanding to you he's in the middle of idol worshippers he's surrounded by family that worship idols who are bowing themselves to Idols that can be seen and they all bow before an image that can be seen they worship a moon that hangs in the sky they worship a sun that travels the circuit they're all worshiping things visible and tangible and they're all bowing before things that can be seen and then Abram bows his face to the Earth to a god that cannot be seen and think of how extraordinary that must have been in the midst of idolators ruled by the Flesh in the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and all these things that would have been tangible and everything that so draws people today in the time that we're living that Abram had absolute zero shame in worshiping a God that was invisible his family is idolators in a Land of idolatry but it's from that pedigree that God elects Abraham and Abraham chooses to worship a God who cannot be seen a God that cannot be set up with hands a God that cannot be described as it travels the Circuit of the Sun or the path of the moon or is found in the stars or some image that man would see as they connect the dots and the sky he worshiped an unseen God that's the faith of Abraham that's the Gentile faith when we think about Abraham he did not step from the Breath of God it's in this way that we think about Adam and how Adam we relate to Adam and in Adam all die and there's this this this concept of of trying to associate ourselves with these conditions that exist in the in the beginning in Adam but Adam he came direct from God Abraham did not step forth from the hand of God or the Breath of God he wasn't even the first he's he's not even a cane or an Abel that could say well I was the first one born of a woman or have some sort of early adopter status or something he's he's chosen out of of all Humanity on the face of the Earth this is the Genesis this is the origin of calling Abraham is he's picked out of all the massive humanity and while everyone else is worshiping gods and erecting idols and in altars to worship gods that can be seen and can be justified he begins to worship a God that's invisible but a God that can justify him and I'm wanting to close but just share a few things in closing to kind of set up for the next part this is a statement that I is becoming just more profound to me and the Masterpiece brother brandham is talking about in in this portion of reading uh brother brandham is talking about how the bride is another Masterpiece in the making says she's the New Testament that's all like oh okay that's all woo you know if that's that's all that's the one I want right That's all folks that's the one I want right there the New Testament said another Masterpiece in the making Christ was the Old Testament the bride's the New Testament and he said it taken uh that old it took all these things to come to this climax in Christ same thing happened through the church ages climax in the bride he's showing that parallel but he makes this statement and he's he begins with Abraham in talking about Christ he says now he's doing the same thing in his never changing method so then the method that he begins to develop in Abraham is remarkable he says we find out in Malachi 3 he said I'm God and I change not he cannot change his method now as he started in Abraham after the fall of the first Masterpiece he started in Abraham on a foundation to build another Masterpiece that's the part I want you to ponder on that's the part I want you to think about a little bit maybe as your homework assignment going forward just in your own personal devotion or prayer he says that Abraham was the foundation of another Masterpiece that when the first Masterpiece fell in the beginning and that there's a prophecy of a redeemer there's a prophecy in Genesis 3:15 of a seed of the woman that was to come and that's the our first inking that there's going to be Redemption we don't have the mat we don't have another uh brick in the foundation another seed swn of that until God says Abram get out of your country and he says that's where God begins to build another Masterpiece Abraham is the seed of another Masterpiece he's the foundation of another Masterpiece he holds within him the framework the outline the DNA The Germ of another Masterpiece he says he started on the day of Pentecost to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word started in the first church what was it now these this is a term I'm not so much focusing on what began in the New Testament but going back to Abraham and what he represents the seed word the word manifested the promise that had been given God had given Abra a promise it says that we are the seeds of Abraham and hes according to the promise Abraham is the one that received the promise so Abraham's promise what did what was he he's the foundation of God building another Masterpiece so that's the seed that God SW that one day produced the Masterpiece Christ so Abraham's promise culminated in a masterpiece Jesus Christ so then what are you another culmination Abraham's Faith culminated climaxed in the the the physical representation of the Messiah the very manifestation of Jesus Christ and the faith of Abraham is going to Climax and culminate in the body of Christ in the very visible manifestation of Jesus Christ in the flesh of his bride it's the same seed Abraham was the foundation of another masterpiece in Matthew chapter 1:1 notice this phrasing the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham now to a Jew you know that would maybe invite an argument as they believe in Abraham they believe in David they believe in that line of that lineage but think of us as Christians then the Messiah the book of the generation of the Messiah the Son of David which is the common reference and refrain that would be used of the Messiah who would have been the son of David but then it says the son of Abraham the son of David evokes these images of the king and the kingdom here's the son of David the king the Messiah this great glorious one the Messiah the one that's going to rule and Reign and restore the kingdom and has such a royal identity to it this great figure of the King David and his family and the lineage son of David the King even as we'd say the son of David it's Christ ruling and reign in the Millennium but then it says the son of Abraham he was a son of a man even representing the son of man that it's not he is the root he he is identified with with humanity and it's Abraham he was the root and the foundation of all of Israel the root and the foundation he had the Messiah had to be traced back not just to David but he had to go all the way back to one man Abraham the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of Abraham to identify Christ with Humanity the Messiah with this son of man with Abraham as we read before if ye be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise the seed is the grain that holds the germ of future plants when you think about a seed that's sewn all the other seeds that come from that seed you plant you plant a fruit seed or you plant a seed in the a seed in the ground and you get a Vine full of uh fruit all containing all these other seeds was all in that Original Seed right there in that seed and it produces many other fruits has many other seeds but all of that had to be in the seed to begin with you are Abraham's seed it's the grain within which The Germ of all future plants is contained to be the seed it's something reserved as The Germ of a new race you are Abraham's seed you are being identified with something particular but yet something so ordinary brother Bram says in the message modern events are made clear by prophecy we are supposed to be the Royal Seed of Abraham Isaac he goes the Royal Seed of Abraham Isaac was the natural seed we are supposed to be the Royal seed but the faith seed not the natural seed now the faith seed the faith in the promised word the promised word he says don't miss it was that Royal seed that was the seed Abraham's faith we been dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed HS with him according to the promise so I I just feel like I'm looking at something I can't even describe because he says Abraham was the first he started in Abraham to build another their Masterpiece Abraham's the seed that sown Christ is the fruit of that seed to think that God's revelation of himself to Abraham was a seed swn into Abraham in one day it brought forth Jesus Christ the revelation of God to Abraham one day brought forth the perfect Son of God the Messiah if he can do it in Abraham he can do it in you if he can do it in Abraham he can do do it in you the seed holds the mystery of the plant Abraham held the mystery of Christ then in the life of Abraham it holds the mystery and Foundation of simple faith it holds the mystery and Foundation of how God is going to translate you and how your faith as a believer in The Invisible God is going to keep you every day of your ordinary life to one day meet the Lord in the air musicians if you'd come the faith seed that was the seed Abraham's Faith he believed and received Christ if we see Jesus Christ as the Living Word that makes God present that's what what Abraham received and it was a seed in him and one day the son of Abraham the son of David came forth in the flesh Jesus Christ and it was the another Masterpiece and so God's just not taking another seed right not just going to take another seed somewhere it's got to be the same seed well this is where I want you to start thinking about the the simple life of Abraham and how it portrays the plan of God the Myster of Redemption all these things when it came time to find a wife for Abraham's son he's like go back to my family because it mattered to him because the wife of the first Masterpiece was not just going to be some other manufactured adopted orphan out there some kind of hybrid some kind of Clone made to look like but it was going to be the same seat of Abraham in the message from that time he says let's take for instance Abraham he was just an ordinary man he come down from Babylon with his father and he dwelt in the land of the calans the city of Earth probably a farmer an ordinary man like to eat berries for breakfast and berries for dinner right go out and kill lunch just ordinary man he was no special man he was just a man and he found Grace in the sight of God God told him when he was 75 years old that that he was going to make him to be a father of Nations he's going to give him a child by his wife Sarah of course we know this Revelation unfolds who was 65 years old at that time and Abraham believed God how was it reckoned to him how how how was it he became Abraham the righteous how is it he became the father of Faith how is it because he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so as you look at Supreme Faith revealed in Abraham just an ordinary man not not special just a man probably a farmer so he himself is a farmer hunted his own food simple man but it's this this ordinary man with an ordinary trade surrounded by Idol worshippers and he believes God he finds Grace in the sight of God this would be this is the this this is the thought I want to present before you maybe the prayer that we would offer over you or the Paradigm that we would step into this is the vision this is the plan this is what God is doing in my life this is the what God is doing in your life may God bring forth this glorious mystery in [Music] US ordinary people living ordinary lives doing ordinary things but we find Grace in the sight of of God yeah none of us should be challenged when we leave here today to try to figure out some profession some education some work some deed something we can do so we can stand out something we can do to prove that we're Abraham's deed something we can do to prove that we're a child of God something we could do to prove that we have faith believe God take him at his word keep living an ordinary life as a student as a daughter as a son as a wife as a husband as a mother as a father as a help as whatever it may be whatever your life has called you to do just keep doing what you're asked to do following the regular routine of scriptures and may it be from this ordinary person living an ordinary life that this glorious Mystery Begins to unfold in me and may the supernatural unfold in the Simplicity of my daily life just going about doing ordinary things maybe it's just farming I preached a series of services one time called farmers in the Rapture and I it wasn't necessarily a cheap trick just to get somebody said click on that in the world does that mean but it's it's the idea is that our way to a body change is living life the right way doing the things of Christ in the nature and spirit of Christ and doing the things of Christ in the nature and spirit of Christ aren't always the things that we think of in terms of oh I wish somebody Could Touch the Hem of my pants and be healed or oh if someone could just my shadow cross over them and and they be made well and we sometimes think of these Miracles that are sign catchers as a way that's going to trans translate our faith listen those signs that we see that get our attention is what brought us into faith in God and then it's that faith in God that begins to mature and grow but it's the ordinary it's it was an ordinary living ordinary life that's cultivating this faith into Supreme Faith so let it be if Abraham was an ordinary man not a special man nothing great to note of him no armies no wealth none of these things made him into something that God would call him then every single one of us today is a candidate for the grace of God and we can be recipients of the same Supernatural then let that seed that was revealed to Abraham that produced Christ let Christ be produced in me let the mystery of Christ unfold the same in me let's stand to our feet let it unfold in [Music] me just in my simply daily life may the supernatural unfold we ought to live under Supernatural expectation but not Supernatural impersonation not to manufacture the supernatural but just to bear it let it happen with our heads bowed let's pray today maybe there's someone who came today discouraged looking back at their life and maybe they were just doing an audit of their years in the [Music] message doing an audit of the trajectory of things and where things are now and asking themselves well you know where you know how are things different and greater and and if we're supposed to be com into a Rapture why is it this happening why isn't that happening I encourage you to look at the life of Abraham and all the great and many promises that were made to him and even within his own family he could have said hey Dad hey brothers guess what in me all the families of the Earth are going to be blessed like you don't even have a son oh no no he said he said he was going to make me a great of me a great nation your wife's Barren there's there's a lot of lot of things when you begin to look at Abraham's life and a lot of promises that God made to Abraham a lot of brags that he would have had that wouldn't seem like they ever made any it came to any manifestation in his life during his life time but he died believing the promise even to where where God gave him the promise that your people Soul Jour in a Strange Land for 400 years and every single promise that God made to Abraham has come to pass even if it didn't happen in his lifetime and you stand here today maybe taking inventory it's your own life and your own trajectory and ins and outs and ups and downs and disappointments and maybe you found yourself being challenged just a little bit and a little bit maybe worried or anxious about are things unfolding or things unfolding then I say that God has supernaturally discerned what was in your heart and your anx xiety and even your assessments and your audit and the way you're looking back on things and trying to assess Church experience and where this is going and where that is going and he's kind of caught you hopefully by God's grace by discernment caught your attention say wait a minute we're not trying to put somebody up on a pedestal and make things out into some kind of fantastic or some kind of imagination in some kind of magical worldly Kingdom of This World With all its bells and whistles and gingerbread and and tinsel but to come down to just a simple life live before God believeing in The Invisible do you have the kind of Faith to say I believe no matter how dark it gets there's a man here who could turn on the light no matter how stagnant see things may seem to be there's a God who has spoken to me and made himself known to me and he speaks to my faith and he speaks to my soul and I cannot resist it and I know that I ought not resist it and I must follow him wherever he leads me and I don't need the the bells and whistles of this world I don't need need the the clamoring of this world and the GL the glow and and all the glitter of this world to keep me going I just need faith in him our gracious Heavenly Father the faith of Abraham is inspiring to us this thought today to see him as an ordinary man living an ordinary life but yet you make a revelation to him and that Revelation becomes the seed of the next Masterpiece and he becomes the foundation of another Masterpiece which culminates and climaxes in Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham Lord as we've expressed from our hearts today there's times when it seems so difficult to be an heir with Christ the sinless son of God who died for our sins but may we lord through that [Music] sacrifice and the same faith that Abraham had come into that [Music] fellowship and help us Lord to even begin to rightly position our faith in the end time for a Rapture by coming back to the foundation of our faith Lord there's a a phrase that we use amongst ourselves quite often will say are they a Believer it means something to us it's a it's a phrase that has its etymology within the message and message Believers and we're we're using it to express whether or not a particular individual believes that brother brandham it was a prophet that fulfilled Malachi 4:5 in the spirit of Elijah [Music] and Lord we use that phrase to express are they a Believer and I'm I poured out My Heart Lord before you I there there is nothing wrong in that but Lord it means nothing it means nothing if that is merely an acknowledgement for an Ascent that you to to a work that you've done a fulfillment of Prophecy and we acknowledge and believe that God has fulfilled his promised word it's it seems empty Lord if we cannot through that come to this place of the faith of Abraham to believe you to recognize all along it was you I pray for the people that are here today that they could walk in the steps of the Patriarchs they could walk in the steps of Abraham walk in the step steps of Isaac walk in the steps of Jacob walk in the steps of Moses walk in the steps of brother Bram walk in the steps that they walked in and those steps being that you reveal yourself and make yourself known to us and upon that conviction and that basis there's a sense way down in our souls that we cannot disregard yay Lord we must follow and follow your word encourage your people today we've been encouraged by our visitors that are with us our fellow Believers and friends that are here I pray that they would likewise be encouraged bless our fellowship may it be sweet Lord may we exhibit a Grace and kindness to one another that cultivates real peace in our hearts Lord we never know what kind of Brokenness finds itself in our midst and on the outside someone can seem so well put together and happy and jovial and willing and ready to assist and always seems to have the right thing to say and we admire them but they come with a deep heaviness in their hearts come with longings and heartaches and sorrow and we can be the Bears of healing we can be the ones that Minister words of encouragement and our our approach and our Grace can wash the Unseen fears and anxieties away may that be our testimony today Lord may we be sensitized to these things because that's the ordinary life that we need to live I pray your blessing upon your people as to commit them to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things amen [Music]
