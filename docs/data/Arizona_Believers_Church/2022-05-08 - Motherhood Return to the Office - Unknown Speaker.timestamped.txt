[0:00] i'm going to take the subject on this
[0:02] mother's day
[0:03] and
[0:04] take a uh in a lot of ways as i looked
[0:06] at this and pondered this
[0:08] this past week
[0:10] it's going to be
[0:11] just the way it seemed like it was
[0:13] unfolding gathering together a lot of
[0:15] things that would be review for us
[0:17] and certainly a lot of things that we've
[0:19] ministered on here but maybe more
[0:21] profoundly things that you're already
[0:23] very much aware of and in tune to and so
[0:26] kind of a review of a number of things
[0:27] the gathering together of prior precepts
[0:29] and even some services we've ministered
[0:31] on just kind of collecting them together
[0:33] in this subject of motherhood
[0:35] to give the honor and recognition that's
[0:38] due to our mothers that are here's a lot
[0:40] of statements we could pull from the
[0:41] message of the hour just to give that
[0:43] lot and that honor on a day like today
[0:46] but lord dealt with my heart in
[0:48] titling the sermon on motherhood
[0:51] and with the subtitle of return to the
[0:53] office and so you're like you're going
[0:55] to have to just catch up brother and
[0:56] we've already moved on from that slide
[0:58] we're already back to the offering slide
[1:00] at this point
[1:01] but um my style subject is motherhood
[1:04] and returned to the office now rto
[1:06] returned to the office it's probably a
[1:08] very familiar phrase that we've been
[1:10] hearing anybody heard this phrase
[1:12] recently no you're still a little bit
[1:13] too far in that one
[1:15] getting ahead of me there brother so
[1:16] maybe we back up a little bit
[1:18] if you want i can just go to the last
[1:20] slide and we can go
[1:21] start early on our reservations
[1:24] so we don't have to wait so long for
[1:25] lunch
[1:26] but um
[1:27] uh you've been hearing the phrase maybe
[1:29] return uh to the office returned office
[1:31] back to the office is a phrase that's
[1:33] been very common amongst corporate
[1:35] america and maybe a lot of you are
[1:36] wrestling with it right now it's
[1:38] actually becoming a huge issue with
[1:39] large corporations that have
[1:41] multi-jurisdictions that they have come
[1:43] uh uh entities in or offices in trying
[1:45] to figure out a way to get everybody
[1:47] who's gone home to come back to work
[1:49] and so the other one is work from home
[1:51] that was the big one now they're trying
[1:52] to get people to come back to the office
[1:54] and so i'm wanting to use that just as a
[1:56] familiar phrase to you but put it in
[1:58] this context of motherhood and return to
[2:00] the office and an office is a it speaks
[2:04] to not just a location
[2:07] or a place of work but it speaks of
[2:09] one's place or even one's function so an
[2:12] office is more than just a physical
[2:14] location and part of the one of the
[2:16] things i'm wanting to identify is a
[2:18] woman's true disposition
[2:20] in looking at these scriptures is
[2:21] there's a certain disposition to a woman
[2:24] uh that is outlined in the scripture
[2:26] things that we want to lift up and
[2:27] promote so when we use the phrase
[2:29] motherhood we're looking at the the
[2:31] suffix hood which is in the english uh
[2:34] this last phrase hood it's a particular
[2:36] state or condition or it's a specific
[2:38] period in someone's life and so when you
[2:40] use this hood and you atta it uh added
[2:43] to another word it can speak of a body
[2:45] of persons of a particular class or
[2:54] also if i need to grab a mic just let me
[2:56] know i'm more than happy to do it we're
[2:58] gonna we're gonna one day come up with
[2:59] so many headsets and lapel mics we're
[3:01] gonna be caught from every angle should
[3:03] i grab something i don't mind it's not
[3:04] going to bother me at all
[3:07] i got a good signal now well we'll see
[3:08] where this goes
[3:10] i know you all can hear me here it's
[3:11] just maybe a little bit annoying
[3:14] sometimes it may be on the stream it
[3:15] drops a little bit so it can be used
[3:18] hood can be added to brotherhood that
[3:19] would speak of body of persons who are
[3:21] united in as brothers or maybe a
[3:23] brotherhood in a fraternity or something
[3:24] neighborhood is a particular class of
[3:27] people that live in a particular area or
[3:29] near one another or it can uh denote a
[3:32] state of being this is something i want
[3:33] you to upon or denote a state of being a
[3:35] uh identify a certain character or
[3:37] condition we say someone is enters into
[3:39] fatherhood when they have a child of
[3:41] theirs they enter into fatherhood or
[3:44] during a particular time of life we call
[3:45] it childhood so these are stages even
[3:48] adulthood would be the state or period
[3:50] of being fully grown fully developed or
[3:52] of a particular age that would be
[3:54] adulthood so same thing is meant when we
[3:56] say motherhood it's the state or fact of
[3:59] being a mother that's what we refer to
[4:02] when we refer to motherhood so with
[4:03] motherhood there's a certain duty with
[4:05] motherhood there's a certain function
[4:07] and motherhood speaks of the office of
[4:10] being a mother when someone enters into
[4:12] motherhood or part of the motherhood it
[4:14] is entering into this place or position
[4:17] or function of being a mother
[4:20] and my desire today is just looking at
[4:23] the word of god and drawing some things
[4:25] out of the message
[4:26] the more i pondered it
[4:28] the more pronounced it became to me just
[4:30] how much you work against these days
[4:33] when you preach on true uh the true
[4:35] woman how much you're fighting against
[4:36] when you preach on motherhood and i
[4:38] really appreciated the special i choose
[4:40] to be
[4:41] a christian
[4:42] in a day and age that values so much of
[4:45] personal choice and personal freedom
[4:48] they don't like it when you choose to be
[4:50] a real christian
[4:51] they feel that that choice in itself is
[4:53] the wrong one and so there's a stigma
[4:56] associated with there's a little bit of
[4:57] pressure to try to get you to denounce
[4:58] it but we are uh we are happy i'm happy
[5:02] to live in a time when the day and age
[5:04] we live in you have to choose to believe
[5:06] this message you have to choose to be a
[5:08] christian because it's not easy anymore
[5:10] you can't just fit in in a particular
[5:12] way you can't just kind of go with the
[5:13] flow and so i really want to defend the
[5:15] honor of womanhood and just lift up the
[5:17] glory of motherhood
[5:19] her place and her function through the
[5:21] word of god
[5:23] and one of the this is maybe my thoughts
[5:25] as they come to me
[5:27] in the original genesis of wanting to
[5:29] minister on this
[5:30] i say that false christianity has
[5:33] marginalized the woman
[5:36] and so there's a there's a brand of
[5:37] christianity that tries to take the
[5:38] woman and beat her up and subjugate her
[5:41] and really this um the wrong kind of
[5:43] patriarchy that wants to dominate and
[5:46] domineer treat the woman as a doormat
[5:48] and so that's kind of uh become the
[5:50] poster child or the poster board of what
[5:52] women don't want and so they look at the
[5:54] false side of things
[5:56] they're just making women out to be less
[5:58] they're doormats they're this and
[5:59] they're that and that's the one that
[6:00] gets all the attention but when you look
[6:02] at it that way that there's been a false
[6:04] christianity on one hand that's
[6:05] marginalized the woman really when you
[6:07] look at it this post-modern feminism is
[6:09] just trying to erase her all together
[6:12] that in one sense you have those well
[6:14] they mistreat women but when you come to
[6:15] the other side they're just trying to
[6:17] erase the woman
[6:18] and many may get the definition wrong
[6:21] and and make women what they're not and
[6:24] use the bible to do and use the religion
[6:26] and use uh their strength to make the
[6:28] woman something different and define her
[6:30] wrong but others just even want to go so
[6:32] far as to deny the essence of womanhood
[6:35] and in doing so it's really changing the
[6:37] place of the woman within society it's
[6:39] changing uh what her ambitions ought to
[6:41] be and her roles are
[6:43] and so i started in genesis chapter two
[6:45] but if we could just back up to genesis
[6:46] chapter 1
[6:48] i'd like to read verse 27
[6:52] and what i want to do is just take a
[6:54] walk through
[6:55] the bible into just in genesis and then
[6:58] back and then over to proverbs
[7:00] in these real obvious places in the
[7:02] scripture
[7:03] to just look at the genesis of the woman
[7:07] it says in genesis chapter 1 verse 27 so
[7:09] god created man in his own image in the
[7:12] image of god created he him male and
[7:15] female created he them oh great here's
[7:17] the they them
[7:19] coming right up in the scripture so god
[7:20] created man in his own image and the
[7:22] image of god created he him male and
[7:25] female created he them brother branham
[7:27] says in marriage and divorce that god
[7:29] has male and female so when we look at
[7:32] this this image of god is male and
[7:35] female and we recognize that this is an
[7:38] entity this is there's a oneness that's
[7:40] being shared and it says god created man
[7:42] in the in the hebrew it's adam that's
[7:44] where we get adam from it's kind of he
[7:46] has the name for all humanity created
[7:49] adam which is man or mankind
[7:51] and it's male and female this humankind
[7:54] this mankind that are appointed they're
[7:55] under divine appointment to manifest the
[7:58] image of god when it says he made them
[8:00] let's make them in our own image in the
[8:02] image of god we're going to create them
[8:05] this is to manifest something about god
[8:08] and the word
[8:10] that is used uh for ma for male because
[8:14] it says that male and female created he
[8:16] them it's god that introduces this
[8:18] division or this distinction male is to
[8:21] comes from the root to call to mind or
[8:23] to remember and so god is wanting us as
[8:26] i even pondered it that god is wanting
[8:28] us this image of man to call to mind god
[8:31] that the way that man would live and the
[8:33] way that he would act and the the power
[8:34] that would be given to him he would call
[8:36] to mind god it would be in a remembrance
[8:38] of god and then female so that's the
[8:41] male and female comes from the root to
[8:43] pierce or to bore through or to a point
[8:46] means to break off or to prick off to
[8:48] designate or to be specified so here's
[8:51] the man who is to call call to one's
[8:53] remembrance or to to to call to mind and
[8:57] then the female is to pierce or to a
[8:59] point or to break off and to designate
[9:02] something specified and it's for it's
[9:04] for a reason that god is using even this
[9:06] language in male and female
[9:08] and we will probably revisit this and uh
[9:11] later on this morning that animals don't
[9:13] ever receive this distinction
[9:15] in the creation it doesn't say that god
[9:17] created a male uh a male of this specie
[9:20] and a female of that it just there's no
[9:22] distinction given but god here is he
[9:25] creates man he wants to denote male and
[9:28] female because it's something that
[9:30] foreshadows the higher purpose for
[9:32] mankind
[9:34] as it recaps in genesis chapter 5 verse
[9:36] 2 it says male and female created he
[9:38] them and blessed them and called their
[9:40] name adam in the day when they were
[9:44] created
[9:45] and so there is a
[9:48] creation of man who are male and
[9:53] of male and female god is
[9:55] precise and even revisits it after the
[9:57] fall that i i've created them this way
[10:00] for a purpose and so their identity
[10:02] and their purpose are linked together
[10:05] male and female blessed
[10:07] male and female together and there's a
[10:09] blessing
[10:10] and i i want to say it at this point
[10:14] that
[10:15] these designations even at the outset
[10:18] are very critical to our understanding
[10:20] creation
[10:21] understanding what god was doing and
[10:22] it's specifically god's purpose for
[10:24] creation
[10:26] and i know that the the
[10:28] scientific approach is that this is kind
[10:30] of just the results of a lottery that's
[10:32] literally the way they teach it that
[10:33] given enough time sales will mutate and
[10:36] given billions and billions of years
[10:38] which they believe we've had the
[10:39] privilege of uh experiencing this is
[10:41] what was produced
[10:43] and so well how did it get here well
[10:44] this is just the order that came from
[10:46] chaos and given enough variations and
[10:48] enough cycles and enough chance to
[10:49] mutate this is just how it evolved and
[10:52] evolved to where we are where we are
[10:53] today by the process of evolution but
[10:56] when we look into the bible what we're
[10:57] finding is that
[10:58] god's design in his creation that it
[11:01] wasn't just thrown out here without
[11:03] purpose it wasn't just thrown out with
[11:05] direction god had a design to it and in
[11:08] verse 28 it says and god blessed them
[11:10] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[11:13] multiply and replenish the earth and
[11:16] subdue it so this is male the male and
[11:19] female in verse 27 this is a male and
[11:21] female under divine order god blessed
[11:25] them and said unto them male and female
[11:27] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[11:31] the earth and subdue it now i know that
[11:33] we've covered this before i might go
[11:35] into just a little bit more detail
[11:37] but i just feel it's important
[11:39] just to kind of walk through it in these
[11:41] paces and i know these are things we all
[11:43] know but maybe they're just cheap amens
[11:45] when we already know it
[11:47] but male and female each hold genetic
[11:50] attributes distinct to each one that
[11:52] develop
[11:53] certain characteristics that are suited
[11:55] for this commandment
[11:57] says be fruitful multiply and replenish
[11:59] the earth god made male and made female
[12:02] and and they're brought up in this
[12:03] context in genesis 1 27 i've made them
[12:06] male and female because i'm about to
[12:08] give them a commandment and giving this
[12:10] commandment to them they could not
[12:12] fulfill this unless they had this
[12:14] distinction between male and female
[12:17] we know in the genetic chromosomes that
[12:18] the male is an x y and the female is an
[12:20] xx
[12:22] and these chromosomes give rise to a
[12:24] distinct biology don't let anybody lie
[12:26] to you and tell you anything different
[12:28] it's just the truth and i think anybody
[12:30] being with some intellectual honesty
[12:31] would have to admit that biologically
[12:33] there is a difference between the male
[12:35] and female male has an xy the female has
[12:38] xx
[12:39] and that's what determines whether
[12:41] you're a male male or a female something
[12:42] that god in the beginning in the scene
[12:46] set forth and put in there from the very
[12:48] beginning god's already outlined it and
[12:50] put it there from the start
[12:52] to where we don't take we don't have an
[12:54] election at six years old and choose
[12:56] which one we want to be it's already
[12:58] there
[12:59] it's already and it's biologically
[13:01] and so these the in the mail the xy the
[13:04] y chromosome is what's dominant and
[13:07] therefore it's what carries the signal
[13:08] to the embryo
[13:10] and to tell them to grow
[13:12] male organs you're going to be a male
[13:13] they're going to be this is what you are
[13:16] and then there's another side to it and
[13:17] this part
[13:18] and i'm getting in this just to make it
[13:20] part of our thought process so that in
[13:21] in pondering this and thinking about it
[13:23] we are considering um how god has made
[13:27] us how god has designed us
[13:29] and in the
[13:30] uh not only is there chromosomes but
[13:32] there's hormones to this and don't have
[13:34] anybody get nervous you know
[13:37] we're going to keep this very scientific
[13:40] but a hormone is a chemical that's
[13:41] released by a cell or by a gland
[13:44] to regulate activity body activity and
[13:46] regulate behavior
[13:48] and it's what promotes development then
[13:50] of these chromosomes that's written in
[13:52] the dna
[13:54] and the word uh hormone comes from the
[13:56] latin word which means that which sets
[13:58] in motion
[14:01] the presents motion
[14:01] the present participle of impel or to
[14:03] urge on which comes from the very root
[14:05] of it is the onset or impulse so god not
[14:08] only gives there's not only a design
[14:11] behind the chromosomes but then there
[14:13] are hormones that then set in motion
[14:17] and impel and urge on the manifestation
[14:21] of those chromosomes this is all part of
[14:23] the this is how god created us and so
[14:26] both male and female have steroid
[14:28] hormones that influence growth that
[14:30] influence development
[14:32] the androgens which include testosterone
[14:34] for males and that's what causes a male
[14:36] to develop into a boy to develop into a
[14:39] man in the estrogens and progestins for
[14:41] females and what's remarkable is females
[14:44] can have testosterone males have
[14:46] estrogen they both have those but
[14:48] whatever's the dominant is what urges on
[14:51] what propels and drives the chromosomes
[14:54] in the dna to develop into the
[14:56] person and so this the dna blueprint for
[15:00] a male the xy that's what produces the
[15:02] melon so in physical development it's
[15:04] that increased testosterone that matures
[15:07] the body and takes a boy into in into
[15:10] manhood it's the same for a female
[15:12] increased estrogen is what matures her
[15:14] into a woman this is all in creation
[15:17] this is all when god says i created a
[15:18] male and female if there would have been
[15:20] an opportunity i believe even at that
[15:22] moment to say all right hold on let's
[15:24] run some tests you'd find that god
[15:25] created man xy he created the woman xx
[15:29] and that god has already placed inside
[15:31] of them something to
[15:33] urge them on compel them and move them
[15:36] on to produce and to manifest what they
[15:38] were called to be
[15:40] now in genesis chapter 2 verse 18 with
[15:42] the biology out of the way we can
[15:45] start to look at how god is going to
[15:46] unfold this and manifest this
[15:49] genesis chapter 2 verse 18 to 21 it says
[15:51] the lord god said it is not good that
[15:53] the man should be alone
[15:55] i will make him a help meet for him i
[15:58] want to come back to
[15:59] the meaning of this word but then notice
[16:01] how peculiar this is
[16:04] that god inserts this narrative
[16:07] in between
[16:08] the time from the time that he
[16:09] pronounces that man needs a help meet
[16:11] until the time that he manifests her
[16:13] says and out of the ground the lord god
[16:14] formed every beast of the field
[16:17] and every fowl of the air and brought
[16:19] them unto adam to see what he would call
[16:21] them so before adam has this help me
[16:24] he's there in this entity and this
[16:26] person
[16:28] and he's naming
[16:29] uh he's naming all the foul all the
[16:32] beasts everything that was created and
[16:33] he's giving them names and whatsoever
[16:35] adam called
[16:37] every living creature that was the name
[16:39] thereof and adam gave names to all
[16:41] cattle
[16:42] and to the fowl the air and every beast
[16:44] of the field but for adam there was not
[16:46] found a help meet for him
[16:49] what's implied in this image
[16:51] in this image
[16:53] of god bringing all creation before adam
[16:56] it's implied that adam would have been
[16:58] each one each set each animal each kind
[17:01] male female male female
[17:04] and it would have been manifested that
[17:06] here is a buck and here's a doe and
[17:08] one's different than the other but
[17:10] they're very similar
[17:12] there's a they're a compliment to one
[17:14] another this mere image would have kept
[17:15] coming up before him that male female
[17:18] male female it's very it's obvious that
[17:19] it's this and it's obvious that it's
[17:21] that and he'd be able to give a name uh
[17:23] to that specific animal that
[17:25] complimented both the male and female
[17:27] he wouldn't name one uh one a bird and
[17:30] one a fish they would come up and
[17:31] together they would be named something
[17:33] because they're joined together there
[17:34] was something complementary there was an
[17:36] image that was expressed and i believe
[17:38] that it's implied in this narrative that
[17:40] adam would have recognized that whereas
[17:42] every other kind had male and female and
[17:44] he saw the male and he saw the female he
[17:47] saw the image he saw the complimentary
[17:48] image as that's coming up before him he
[17:50] would have thought
[17:52] i'm different
[17:55] i i'm created by the same god and even
[17:58] to think that there would be those that
[17:59] had been very human-like and and very
[18:02] close near to the the stature and nature
[18:04] of adam and he would have seen male
[18:06] female male female he thought well this
[18:07] is very different i don't even have this
[18:10] likeness now we know god's doing this
[18:11] for a reason he's portraying something
[18:13] very beautiful
[18:14] but it's with that image that god comes
[18:16] to verse 21 it says and the lord caused
[18:18] a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he
[18:21] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[18:24] closed up the flesh
[18:26] instead thereof so notice now when you
[18:28] say the woman to makes female to get the
[18:31] female out he's got to pierce through
[18:33] adam
[18:34] he's got to bore through adam he's got
[18:36] to prick it off something and break off
[18:38] something and a point and designate a
[18:40] portion of adam he's got to separate
[18:42] mankind separate apart from man and to
[18:45] bring her forth and so that's what male
[18:47] and female it foreshadowed that there
[18:49] was going to be an appointing a
[18:50] designated specifying from this
[18:52] femininity from this mankind and
[18:54] humanity and divide them to
[18:57] and in the hebrew when he says and what
[19:00] he creates when he pierces through and
[19:02] takes out this rib he makes an help meet
[19:05] for him
[19:06] that's what he makes not a help mate not
[19:08] a mate but a help meet for him
[19:10] and in the hebrew it means one to be at
[19:12] hand
[19:14] the the easier connect go it's one to be
[19:16] at hand one to be near one to always be
[19:18] ready to help and to comfort this is
[19:20] when he says i'm gonna make him a help
[19:22] meet it's one who stands by his side
[19:24] who's there to help him
[19:26] and and this word help me it's very
[19:28] important to recognize uh the image that
[19:31] god is wanting to portray in this
[19:33] because this is the woman this is her
[19:36] identity this is their office this is
[19:37] their place this is their function it's
[19:39] one before him the word means one before
[19:42] him so you want to get the best picture
[19:44] of what it means this is one before him
[19:46] we all most of us like probably look
[19:48] around and tell who did and who didn't
[19:49] but most of us stood in front of amir
[19:52] this morning and that's exactly what it
[19:54] means one before him
[19:56] it's as if in a mirror correspondent to
[19:58] him one who has a counterpart suitable
[20:01] to a nature and to need one in this help
[20:03] me that's one like himself in shape and
[20:06] constitution and disposition the word
[20:09] actually means a second self
[20:11] it wouldn't necessarily be strictly
[20:13] translated that way but when you look at
[20:15] the word one to be at hand and ready to
[20:16] help and to comfort god was taking adam
[20:19] and dividing him into two and so it was
[20:21] a second self to him
[20:24] now we could read that the woman is to
[20:26] be a compliment to him she's always to
[20:27] be ready to help and to comfort and to
[20:29] be correspondent to him and to be one
[20:31] like him one suitable to his nature and
[20:33] his need and we could see that once he
[20:35] took the woman out that's what she is to
[20:37] him but it works in the reverse
[20:40] right
[20:41] some of you brave brothers please help
[20:43] me out today
[20:45] and your sisters you can just be quiet
[20:47] and meek as much as you want just pray
[20:48] dear god
[20:49] help him get it
[20:51] it works in the opposite
[20:54] because it's a mirror
[20:56] if you're looking in a mirror and you
[20:57] say well you're you're my mirror image
[20:59] and you're suitable to me and you're
[21:01] compatible with me and you're
[21:02] complementary to my needs and you're
[21:04] there to support me and you're there to
[21:05] help me it works in the opposite because
[21:08] this is reciprocal
[21:10] the image of
[21:11] this image of this woman that is brought
[21:13] out of the man we say well she was made
[21:15] to help man but she's a compliment to
[21:17] man so it meant that if she was meeting
[21:19] the need of man then man was needy
[21:23] there was something that there was
[21:24] something that she was going to do to
[21:26] complement the man god would not have
[21:28] brought her forth if adam could have
[21:30] done everything else on his own
[21:32] and there's certainly things that adam
[21:34] could have done on his own he named all
[21:35] the animals without the help of his wife
[21:37] he was there to name the animals and
[21:39] give them all their names and give them
[21:40] their descriptions and give them their
[21:41] titles but yet there's something that
[21:43] the man needed help in doing there's
[21:45] something to fulfill his purpose and so
[21:48] he created uh created the woman or
[21:50] brought the woman out of the man as a
[21:52] compliment to him but he is a compliment
[21:55] to her
[21:57] the world truly has the image of manhood
[21:58] has been equally perverted
[22:01] to create the wrong image of a man
[22:03] and in doing so it it perverts the image
[22:06] of a woman
[22:07] and so to be a help me it's a
[22:09] counterpart formed from him
[22:12] this is remarkable this is a companion
[22:14] formed from the man it was a perfect
[22:17] resemblance of his person
[22:19] again i keep using the terminology
[22:20] compliment she was complimentary to him
[22:24] help me as it signifies one
[22:27] like or as himself standing opposite to
[22:30] or before him
[22:32] the word is used in other places where
[22:34] one sat across my other face to face as
[22:37] a mirror
[22:38] that's what she was
[22:40] and so god pierces adam
[22:43] to break off the specific designation of
[22:46] female and it's god that makes the
[22:48] difference
[22:49] it's god in the beginning it says god
[22:51] created humankind and he didn't just
[22:53] leave it at that he he said that there
[22:54] was male and female
[22:57] the woman was to be the perfect
[22:58] resemblance of the man possessing not
[23:01] inferiority nor superiority but in all
[23:04] things was like and equal to the man
[23:08] and that's originally how god made it
[23:11] and so it's god that separates male and
[23:13] female
[23:14] we can use the terminology it's god that
[23:16] brings that division i think we covered
[23:18] this um it may have been really at the
[23:20] very very beginning so it may have been
[23:22] in 2020
[23:23] and how that when god divided male and
[23:25] female
[23:26] even our word for sex when we say male
[23:29] or female you have to declare on an
[23:30] application what your sex is that word
[23:32] comes from division
[23:35] it's a separating
[23:36] it's god that did the dividing it's god
[23:38] that sex sector the word comes from male
[23:41] and female as far as being sexes and the
[23:43] state of being male or female it comes
[23:45] from
[23:46] in two it means two parts
[23:49] it's exactly exactly the language we use
[23:52] when we say what sex are you male or
[23:54] female it's a division of the human race
[23:58] and so continuing on in verse 22 as it
[24:00] says that god took that rib
[24:02] and then when it says he took one of the
[24:04] ribs and closed up the flesh that tells
[24:06] us he opened up the flesh he pierced he
[24:08] bore through and the rib which the lord
[24:10] god had taken from man
[24:12] made he a woman and brought her under
[24:15] the man if you recall how rib is even
[24:17] the word that's used for side chamber
[24:19] even in the temple the cells and
[24:21] chambers inside the temple beautiful
[24:23] image of how man there was a there was a
[24:25] there was a chamber there were cells
[24:26] there was a part of the man that god
[24:28] designated to be removed from the man
[24:31] that would become part of the woman
[24:34] i'm trying to remember if it happened in
[24:35] my own family or or what the story is of
[24:37] a young boy one time waking up and
[24:40] feeling his ribs true story from what i
[24:42] remember and feeling around and saying
[24:43] mom i think my rib is missing
[24:45] uh having heard the story of adam
[24:48] and uh fortunately it doesn't quite work
[24:49] that way because some of us are probably
[24:51] so pain intolerant we'd never get
[24:52] married
[24:54] but this this is what god does is he
[24:56] takes this rib it's this side chamber
[24:58] and it says from man he takes this rib
[25:00] and from man made he a woman
[25:04] the word there man is adam from adam
[25:06] made he a woman isha which means this is
[25:09] what woman is so when he introduces when
[25:12] she comes out of man it's not just adam
[25:14] dose or adam 2.0 there's a language
[25:17] that's given that's different now it's
[25:19] isha and he introduces the bible says
[25:22] and he brought her unto the man he
[25:24] introduces the woman to the man
[25:27] adam
[25:29] and this is what i was really
[25:32] enjoying last week as i was pondering
[25:34] these things is at this very moment this
[25:37] may be where the inspiration struck me
[25:39] this very moment when god brings the
[25:41] woman to the man
[25:43] this manifestation unlocks a revelation
[25:46] when he sees it something brother
[25:47] branham even says that that's put a
[25:49] strike he says that struck in humanity
[25:52] and and it it so struck
[25:55] humanity it put a shock in adam that
[25:57] still resides in mankind today from this
[26:00] moment right here genesis 2 22 when adam
[26:03] saw the woman it put a shock in him
[26:06] triggered something in his dna that is
[26:08] still resides in mankind today from that
[26:12] moment on because it unlocks something
[26:14] in the man he'd never seen
[26:16] and the in the prior verses male female
[26:18] male female male female he had seen a
[26:19] lot of beauty a lot of wonderful
[26:20] creation he'd even seen all the way up
[26:22] to the serpent he would have seen the
[26:24] manifestation and god's creation of
[26:26] great beauty and incredu in all sorts of
[26:29] details and peculiarities that would be
[26:31] very very beautiful to see you know oh
[26:33] my this is wonderful this is amazing
[26:35] this is fantastic but something when he
[26:37] sees her unlocks a revelation in him
[26:40] and he begins to utter in verse 23 and
[26:43] adam said this is now bone of my bones
[26:46] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[26:49] called woman because she was taken out
[26:51] of man
[26:53] flesh of his flesh because she was from
[26:55] his physical body
[26:56] the word that's used the basar means to
[26:58] publish or show forth the woman was was
[27:00] published from the man she was brought
[27:02] forth from the man
[27:04] bones of my bones that i comes a little
[27:07] bit deeper flesh of my flesh the
[27:08] physical part bone of my bones it's
[27:10] essence of my essence
[27:13] substance of my substance
[27:15] self of myself
[27:17] this is very deep
[27:19] it's not just the components it's not
[27:21] just the same
[27:22] uh the same material but now it's bone
[27:24] of my bones and there's an essence in
[27:26] this woman there's a substance in this
[27:28] woman itself of myself because she was
[27:30] taken out of the
[27:32] man
[27:34] and so it's after the woman comes
[27:38] from the man when it says taken out of
[27:40] the man it's not adam but it refers to
[27:42] him as ish
[27:44] which is the same word for husband
[27:45] that's used in genesis chapter 3. so now
[27:48] adam has a transformation
[27:50] when the woman is formed the office
[27:52] changes
[27:54] when they're together in in one entity
[27:56] here's adam he's male and female or
[27:59] they're represented in this singular
[28:00] form the spirit of male and female is in
[28:03] in the flesh of adam but now once the
[28:06] woman is appointed once she's designated
[28:09] the office changes and they step into a
[28:11] new relationship
[28:13] had the woman never been expressed it
[28:14] would have been adam adam adam but now
[28:16] that the woman is present and she's isha
[28:18] he's the ish to the isha
[28:21] he's now steps into a new relationship
[28:24] and so now all of humanity and mankind
[28:26] has a different designation
[28:28] and it's a designation that's essential
[28:30] that's essential to understanding god in
[28:32] heaven
[28:34] and so is whether you would view this as
[28:36] a continuation of adam's declaration
[28:39] or god's uh inspiration according to
[28:43] what adam just said she is born of my
[28:46] bones flesh of my flesh she shall be
[28:48] called woman because she was taken out
[28:50] of man
[28:51] it says in verse 24 therefore shall a
[28:53] man leave his father and his mother
[28:56] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[28:58] shall be one flesh
[29:01] therefore shall a man which is the the
[29:04] ish leave his father and his mother and
[29:06] cleave unto his wife the isha
[29:09] and they shall be one flesh
[29:12] now you have the office of male and
[29:14] female
[29:16] it's no longer just male and female it's
[29:17] just not human kind or adam but now it's
[29:20] man
[29:21] and wife these are the offices of male
[29:23] and female
[29:25] and this is part of again like as i said
[29:27] you whether you view this as part of
[29:29] adam speaking
[29:31] or god god's pronouncement
[29:34] according to adam's revelation this is a
[29:37] prophetic utterance that's demonstrated
[29:39] either by adam or by god himself upon
[29:41] the moment that the woman is declared
[29:43] upon meeting the woman out of this is
[29:46] bone of my bone flesh of my flesh and
[29:48] the bible says for this
[29:49] and a man shall leave it says amen
[29:53] a man leave his father and his mother
[29:56] shall cleave under his wife it connects
[29:57] it is some causation or some reason
[30:00] in mark chapter 10 verses 6 to 7 it says
[30:03] but from the beginning of the creation
[30:05] god made them male and female this is
[30:06] jesus's rebuke to the men who were
[30:09] trying to kind of pound the bible that
[30:11] moses said we could have a divorce moses
[30:13] said we could do it he says but from the
[30:15] beginning of creation god made them male
[30:17] and female for this cause shall a man
[30:20] leave his father and mother and cleave
[30:22] to his wife
[30:23] what does that mean for this reason
[30:26] for this cause because of the woman now
[30:28] you can say yeah because of the woman
[30:29] but she's part of this this bringing
[30:32] together of man and woman for this cause
[30:35] because of the woman a man will leave
[30:38] and what does he do he introduces
[30:41] new relationships
[30:42] new offices
[30:44] in genesis chapter 1 male and female
[30:46] genesis chapter 2 man and wife but now
[30:49] it's not just man man and wife it's
[30:51] father and mother
[30:54] all just before this chapter can close
[30:56] god is introducing everything and this
[30:58] is some of the things that we went
[30:59] through in the beginning god created a
[31:01] family it's all portrayed in those first
[31:03] two chapters what god was leading up to
[31:05] what god was foreshadowing what god was
[31:07] wanting to build to you have male and
[31:08] female husband and wife but now a father
[31:11] and mother
[31:12] and you look in the bible you see that
[31:14] animals could be either sex and they
[31:16] could be male and female and because of
[31:18] that they could procreate and bring
[31:19] forth but they never
[31:21] carry the designation or office of
[31:23] husband and wife and they never carry
[31:25] the designation of father and mother
[31:29] so you have the male who becomes a man
[31:33] a female who becomes the woman
[31:36] and it's greater it's a greater
[31:37] expression just male
[31:39] it's greater expression than just female
[31:42] but now it's not just
[31:44] man woman but it's father the head or
[31:46] founder of a household it comes from the
[31:48] word ab the producer the generator
[31:51] and the mother m
[31:53] which is the point of departure think of
[31:54] that point of departure or division
[31:57] why is it why why is she called m father
[32:00] ab the producer the generator but she's
[32:02] called the point of division
[32:04] or or departure because through her
[32:07] forms another branch
[32:09] the man is a generator but the woman
[32:11] forms the point of departure that when
[32:13] that child comes forth there is another
[32:16] branch there's a division now
[32:19] and so the female
[32:22] the male we see the male we can focus on
[32:24] god created the man adam but it's in the
[32:26] mirror image that female to womanhood to
[32:28] motherhood
[32:30] and that's the beautiful mystery of
[32:31] god's creation
[32:33] this is how god has outlined it this is
[32:35] how god has laid it out in the scripture
[32:38] that there's something in the female
[32:41] to be a
[32:42] to be a woman and there's something in
[32:44] the woman to be a mother something to be
[32:46] unlocked
[32:47] in the manifestation of these things and
[32:49] so it closes with this
[32:51] verse 25 and they were both naked
[32:54] the man and his wife and were not
[32:57] ashamed
[32:59] naked it's it there's a it means bear as
[33:02] even asked by one of the young
[33:04] sunday school kids here recently they
[33:07] were very sincere about it they said
[33:10] adam and eve in the beginning didn't
[33:11] have clothes right and i said that's
[33:12] correct and he said when we go to heaven
[33:14] is that going to be the case
[33:16] and i was able to show them some
[33:17] scripture where we'd be dressed
[33:21] and they went
[33:25] but it says that they were bare that has
[33:27] a spiritual application not just a
[33:29] physical application
[33:30] because then it says the man and his
[33:32] wife the husband and wife and were not
[33:36] ashamed
[33:37] they weren't disconcerted they weren't
[33:39] anxious they weren't disappointed
[33:41] they had no lacking or
[33:44] more particularly there was no anxiety
[33:46] because of lack
[33:48] i know we can't relate
[33:50] it's impossible to relate to what they
[33:52] must have felt and how they must have
[33:53] experienced life but here they are in
[33:56] the beginning naked
[33:58] he says and they're not ashamed they
[34:00] didn't look around they weren't
[34:01] disappointed
[34:02] they weren't dissatisfied they weren't
[34:04] displeased they weren't made to feel oh
[34:05] i wish it wasn't this way i wish it was
[34:07] that way there was just this
[34:09] contentedness in their calling commit
[34:11] contentedness in their condition
[34:14] and it says and they were both naked the
[34:16] man and his wife and were not ashamed
[34:17] this is the man and the woman in their
[34:19] essence in their place and their
[34:20] position what they were essentially man
[34:23] and woman husband wife husband the male
[34:26] the wife the woman
[34:28] and there was no shame or fear in this
[34:30] arrangement
[34:33] but what did satan attack
[34:36] it's the first thing he attacked
[34:38] he went after the woman the point of
[34:40] departure the division
[34:42] and listen to some of the statements
[34:43] that brother adam uses i'm just going to
[34:45] read through these quickly i didn't
[34:46] provide them on the slide i kind of
[34:48] maybe with this foundation i'm just
[34:50] transitioning a little bit i appreciate
[34:52] your real diligence and faithfulness to
[34:54] listen
[34:55] uh listen this morning i'm using two
[34:57] mics so i hope that's helpful
[35:01] he's brother branham says a woman a
[35:03] precious jewel that god has made her to
[35:05] be a mother and entrusted her with
[35:07] motherhood it's not even thought of that
[35:09] way anymore it's more of like an
[35:11] unintended consequence it's a more a
[35:13] flaw than a feature oh great i got to
[35:15] worry about getting pregnant or i don't
[35:16] want to become a mother this is going to
[35:18] hinder something and so i want you to
[35:20] begin to think now how there's certain
[35:21] ways that motherhood is put in
[35:24] categories that devalues motherhood
[35:27] and and really
[35:29] it's not i'm not going to adjust the
[35:31] value of motherhood by tearing anything
[35:32] else down i just want to restore back
[35:34] the value of motherhood
[35:36] and so he's saying think of this is a
[35:38] precious jewel the woman is a precious
[35:40] jew and he's made her to be a mother
[35:42] he's entrusted her with
[35:44] motherhood
[35:46] he says as a woman she has a sacred
[35:47] responsibility to her motherhood so
[35:49] motherhood is a sacred responsibility
[35:53] he said that's committed or this is
[35:55] another statement that's committed to
[35:56] our sacred virtue sacred womanhood and
[35:59] then sacred motherhood
[36:02] these are the the uh womanhood could be
[36:04] just the state of being fully grown as a
[36:07] woman
[36:08] but then motherhood is the state or fact
[36:10] of being a mother
[36:12] and this is a sacred he calls it a
[36:14] sacred
[36:15] responsibility
[36:16] a sacred
[36:18] virtue
[36:20] and then he makes statements such as
[36:22] this
[36:23] and i believe it's very important for us
[36:25] to kind of catch
[36:27] the reality of this
[36:29] and the backbone of any nation is
[36:31] womanhood
[36:33] when it comes to morals
[36:35] and you break motherhood you've broke
[36:37] your nation
[36:39] i know maybe his men were like well if
[36:41] something's broke we can fix it right so
[36:43] all right fine women broke it we'll fix
[36:45] it no sorry ain't gonna happen
[36:47] i think it's kind of that obvious this
[36:49] argument that off you know you often
[36:50] hear from each side but the women say
[36:52] well if it wasn't if it wasn't for a
[36:54] woman there would be no children
[36:57] and if it wasn't for a man there would
[37:00] be no children
[37:02] you can't get into that argument
[37:04] and so but there's a reality here that
[37:07] the woman if you break womanhood you
[37:09] break the nation
[37:12] and
[37:14] this should be a shame
[37:16] it should be a shame to break motherhood
[37:18] it should be it should be a horrible
[37:20] thing to break motherhood or to devalue
[37:22] it but it isn't shamed it's glorified
[37:26] he says in another place motherhood has
[37:27] been broken
[37:29] mothers don't stay at home no more with
[37:30] their children like they used to they
[37:32] got to have a job
[37:34] again i want you to recognize that it's
[37:36] not just merely women working but it's
[37:38] what it was taking women away from
[37:41] it was a choice being set before and
[37:43] them choosing on their own and of their
[37:45] own free will and their own liberties to
[37:47] choose i do not want to be a mother i do
[37:49] not want to have children i want to
[37:51] pursue this and he says they don't want
[37:53] to stay home and it and they don't but
[37:55] he says the problem is they don't stay
[37:57] home with their children like they used
[37:59] to
[38:01] i don't believe you can uh you're gonna
[38:03] you could take the message and create
[38:05] some sort of absolute that if a woman
[38:07] works she's antichrist there's it's it's
[38:09] the calling of a woman that was being
[38:12] forsaken when she enters the workforce
[38:14] or wants to pursue something at the sake
[38:17] of not fulfilling some marital duty or
[38:20] stepping into her calling as a mother
[38:22] so it's not just women working but it
[38:24] was the value of motherhood being
[38:25] degraded
[38:26] the value of staying at home oh you just
[38:28] want to stay at home and you you don't
[38:29] want to get a job and you don't want to
[38:31] pursue this or pursue that that was
[38:33] motherhood was being shamed
[38:35] she says in another place women has got
[38:37] a great place
[38:39] it's sacred nice wonderful place but she
[38:41] must keep herself that way
[38:43] to hold her office as she should as a
[38:46] mother as a woman and of motherhood when
[38:48] the womanhood is broke the backbone of
[38:51] any nation is broke
[38:53] that's the strength that god brother
[38:55] branham is giving mothers
[38:58] within the family if it's i say if it's
[39:00] the backbone of the nation it's the
[39:01] backbone of a family
[39:03] it's the backbone of the nation it's the
[39:04] backbone of our own families and even
[39:07] our composition here as a church is true
[39:09] motherhood and he says it's sacred it's
[39:11] a wonderful place she must keep herself
[39:12] that way hold her office as a mother as
[39:16] a woman
[39:17] so motherhood is an office that needs to
[39:19] be held and woman who has an office that
[39:21] needs to be held says if you break that
[39:23] you're going to break the backbone the
[39:25] strength
[39:27] of the nation
[39:28] if the woman's the backbone maybe the
[39:30] man's the muscle but they have to work
[39:31] together in order to accomplish things
[39:34] and so the glory and the strength of a
[39:36] woman i i mean
[39:38] i really feel uh
[39:41] you know i i hope i've done some justice
[39:44] and looking at the scripture i almost
[39:45] feel that maybe i should go back through
[39:46] it
[39:47] um
[39:48] and
[39:49] and look at the scriptures again to try
[39:51] to express to you
[39:52] just
[39:53] how much god was portraying when he
[39:55] created the woman
[39:56] from a standpoint of beauty
[39:58] from the standpoint of ability and grace
[40:02] because the glory and the strength of a
[40:03] woman in her office in her calling is
[40:04] unsurpassed
[40:07] and many forces have pulled the woman
[40:10] out of her office to pursue
[40:12] certain works or images or certain
[40:14] accomplishments and it's forces that do
[40:16] it so we could we could maybe blame a
[40:19] wicked woman and an evil woman but
[40:21] there's forces that work against her
[40:23] driving her to pursue things because she
[40:25] feels this is what is expected from her
[40:27] or she feels this is what she must do
[40:29] and she'll do it even against her own
[40:31] nature actually have to do things to
[40:33] fight against her own makeup her own
[40:35] chromosomes and hormones to work against
[40:38] the way that she's formed the way that
[40:40] she's made to cause so that she can
[40:42] pursue things that she thinks of the
[40:44] right things she ought to pursue
[40:47] and and i if i if this is just me you
[40:49] don't have to a man maybe this i'm
[40:50] giving you warning you can just sit on
[40:53] your hands and
[40:54] clench your lips a little bit if you
[40:55] don't want to instinctively say man when
[40:57] you don't mean it but i believe there's
[40:59] been an endless shaming of the virtue of
[41:01] the woman in motherhood
[41:03] the true virtue of a woman and how god
[41:05] made her even if it's in her biology
[41:07] even if it's in her instincts and her
[41:09] and her nature that the womanhood how
[41:11] god intended it what motherhood how god
[41:13] intended it there's just a constant
[41:15] shaming of it
[41:18] and it doesn't have to be overt and they
[41:19] say oh these silly women having babies
[41:21] or these silly women being dainty or
[41:23] these women doing this they don't have
[41:25] to
[41:26] say it overtly all they have to do is uh
[41:29] give this these honors of bravery and
[41:32] these
[41:33] accolades of bravery and courage to
[41:35] those who abandoned their identity for a
[41:38] new one
[41:39] that's all you have to do in order to
[41:41] devalue the essence the truth when the
[41:43] essence of something is that is what it
[41:45] is and you could go to all the caitlyn's
[41:47] you want and you say well that you may
[41:49] want to identify as something else but
[41:51] in your essence you're something else
[41:54] in your essence you are who you are and
[41:56] so it's not that it has to be overt
[41:57] women bad women no good and women need
[42:00] to change women this and women that no
[42:01] all you have to do is begin to promote
[42:04] and laud and honor and recognize the
[42:06] bravery and courage of somebody who
[42:08] forsakes their gender for another one
[42:10] and it creates unspoken a stigma and a
[42:14] devaluing of one's original calling
[42:17] i i think i've mentioned it here before
[42:19] but i thought this the headline couldn't
[42:20] have been truer but it said it may have
[42:22] been an op-ed piece but it said women
[42:24] are now uh third-class citizens
[42:27] and it was all based upon the argument
[42:29] that uh that they believe there's
[42:31] inequality in the workforce and there's
[42:32] inequality in pay and there's all sorts
[42:34] of inequalities and and it really stands
[42:37] to reason when you drill down it i find
[42:39] myself i'm going to get caught up in the
[42:40] numbers all of a sudden and i'll try to
[42:42] back out of it very quickly but it's
[42:44] like okay if there is one let's get into
[42:46] it and figure out why and you'll find oh
[42:48] because there's actual differences
[42:50] between a male and female
[42:51] and but if on the basis of these
[42:53] inequalities and they recognize this
[42:55] disparity between the man and the woman
[42:57] and and funding and competition but then
[43:02] you swing so far the other way to where
[43:03] you're going to let a man choose to be a
[43:05] woman so now he is allowed to compete in
[43:08] women's sports and what happens he's
[43:10] better than all the women and so now the
[43:12] feminists are kind of going wait a
[43:14] minute hold on
[43:15] we're now third class citizens and i
[43:17] want to say no no no fourth class
[43:20] wait until the women get on catch on and
[43:22] want to become men
[43:24] and so a woman at her essence is going
[43:26] to become a fourth-class citizen
[43:28] and i may be short-sighted i'm pretty
[43:30] sure there's a 22nd class already that
[43:32] they're working on
[43:33] but that this is what happens when you
[43:35] get away from the way that god designed
[43:38] things
[43:39] now this is um this is from a book you
[43:41] don't have to write it down you don't
[43:42] have to buy it on amazon prime same day
[43:44] delivery
[43:45] i haven't read the book just read parts
[43:47] of it i believe it was a professor from
[43:50] uh you know a university of north
[43:51] carolina james twitchell
[43:53] and his book was for shame was it called
[43:56] the name of the book for shame the loss
[43:57] of common decency in american culture
[44:00] he says we're living in shameless times
[44:02] i find it a paradox the way that he's
[44:04] using us because
[44:05] there's there's a lack of shame but then
[44:07] there's a reciprocal
[44:09] uh shame that's being placed he says
[44:11] we're living in shameless times when i
[44:13] was growing in the 50s
[44:15] public drunkenness filing for bankruptcy
[44:17] having an abortion or a child out of
[44:19] wedlock drug addiction hitting a woman
[44:21] looting stores using vulgar language in
[44:23] public being on the public dole or
[44:25] welfare or getting into divorce was
[44:28] enough to make you hang your head
[44:30] anybody awake enough in the 50s
[44:32] can we get a can we get a witness on
[44:34] that
[44:35] i mean these are the things that people
[44:36] were ashamed of people would hide their
[44:38] bankruptcy they if someone was abused or
[44:41] looting stores vulgar vulgar language in
[44:43] public having an abortion or a child out
[44:45] of wedlock public drunkenness uh drug
[44:48] addictions these are all things that
[44:49] make you hang your head in shame he says
[44:52] most of these reflected concerns about
[44:54] limiting individual behavior within a
[44:56] group i think it's a very astute
[44:58] observation
[44:59] that this is behavior you wanted to
[45:01] limit a particular behavior within a
[45:03] group he says you want to feel ashamed
[45:05] today or feel shamed today you ready you
[45:07] want to have feel shame wear fur coat
[45:12] smoke in public grow fat have a nose too
[45:14] big don't recycle
[45:18] eat meat
[45:21] or corn fed beef
[45:24] he said most of these acts violate codes
[45:27] of consumption
[45:29] i think i want you to kind of catch what
[45:30] he just said so at one time there was
[45:33] shameful behaviors but now the shame is
[45:36] is on things such as you don't recycle
[45:38] pearl clutching
[45:41] you eat meat you know what you're doing
[45:42] to the environment
[45:44] all right there's such a uh there's a
[45:46] shame placed on these things he said but
[45:48] these acts violate codes of consumption
[45:52] think of where the shift has been to
[45:54] consumption she says somehow things have
[45:56] changed he says where did the shame go
[45:59] or better yet how did it get redirected
[46:02] to such often trivial concerns
[46:06] there was a shame at one time of certain
[46:08] things and it's like wow in this
[46:11] that's shameful that's not good that's
[46:13] not you know you shouldn't do that
[46:14] that's that's abhorrent behavior but now
[46:17] the shame is being stigmatized in other
[46:19] things that just violate consumerism
[46:22] it has more to do with economics it has
[46:24] more to do with um unfounded moral
[46:27] platitudes this is just a this is a
[46:29] professor i don't know that he claims to
[46:31] be a christian um i don't know if he's
[46:33] been canceled maybe i should have looked
[46:34] into this a little bit more before i
[46:35] quoted from him but he's identifying
[46:38] something has changed
[46:40] we don't value the same things we used
[46:42] to value and we shame things now that
[46:44] seem to be so innocuous and why would
[46:46] that even matter and the things that we
[46:48] let people do now when it comes to
[46:49] publicly cussing and getting drunk and
[46:52] all the reality things that we promote
[46:54] those things aren't shamed they're
[46:55] glorified
[46:58] these things they they
[47:00] if i could say this this is where
[47:02] maybe it's easy maybe to go down a
[47:04] rabbit trail but just think of how much
[47:05] they sensationalize sin
[47:07] in order to sell advertising
[47:10] where they have tv shows uh
[47:13] i don't know what they're called but
[47:14] they're teenage mothers and the reality
[47:16] shows that father that follow uh
[47:20] mothers teenage mothers are having
[47:21] babies at 15 they turn into a reality
[47:24] show and they become superstars
[47:26] so what do they do they commercialize
[47:28] something that would be a very sad
[47:30] difficult situation and something that
[47:33] requires some attention and
[47:35] and you'd want to have some sensitivity
[47:36] to it but they glorify to the voice oh
[47:38] don't worry about it we'll make you
[47:39] millions off of this
[47:42] i think how i've seen the headline
[47:43] recently is one of these stars committed
[47:45] suicide
[47:46] wow they're just being they're being
[47:48] used
[47:51] because it's it's
[47:52] consumption has become the goal
[47:55] consumerism has become the goal
[47:57] in proverbs chapter 31 i think we're
[47:59] moving along just
[48:01] nicely now in proverbs chapter 31 i
[48:04] wanted to focus in genesis chapter 2.
[48:06] now we're going to look at proverbs 31.
[48:08] i trust that you are awake this morning
[48:11] staying with me
[48:14] laboring with everything that is in you
[48:16] to stick this one out
[48:19] and if you just are having a hard time
[48:21] do it for mom
[48:24] do it for mom
[48:26] it says in proverbs 31 verse 10 who can
[48:28] find a virtuous woman it suggests
[48:31] perhaps it's not easy to find
[48:33] if i could say right now who could find
[48:35] a red chair wouldn't be hard who could
[48:36] find red carpet wouldn't be hard
[48:39] as a matter of fact i wish we could just
[48:40] kind of forget about it but
[48:42] uh you say who can find a virtuous woman
[48:44] the question itself is not rhetorical in
[48:46] the sense of oh throw a rock you're
[48:48] going to hit one it's no this is rare
[48:51] this is precious
[48:53] it says for her price is far above
[48:55] rubies hey who can find a virtuous woman
[48:58] virtuous means strength or might or
[49:00] ability efficiency when used of a woman
[49:02] it refers to her strength of character
[49:04] not physical strength but her ability
[49:06] her efficiency her might when it comes
[49:08] to her courage and her her spiritual
[49:10] zeal ever heard the phrase tiger mama
[49:13] right it's a real thing ah there's a
[49:16] there's a there's a there's a gear that
[49:18] women have it's something that god has
[49:20] put in her it's part of her essence that
[49:22] when she's sick she can accomplish
[49:24] things that a man cannot when he's
[49:26] equally as sick
[49:28] right and if we want to get into the
[49:30] debate i said that's fine
[49:32] you go chop wood right like no no no
[49:35] that's my that's my job i'll chop the
[49:37] wood and i can go chop wood and when i
[49:39] get a sore throat i'm in bed all day
[49:42] right
[49:43] it's because i could chop wood
[49:45] but a woman though she has this strength
[49:47] she has some deep resolve who can find a
[49:50] virtuous woman it's a way of describing
[49:52] her rarity
[49:53] she's a very rare because her price is
[49:55] far above rubies
[49:57] if we took the time to read it
[49:59] we could go through these several verses
[50:01] here the price of a virtuous woman
[50:03] and how she cares for her family she
[50:05] helps the needy she speaks wisdom
[50:07] but it describes her as precious
[50:09] trustworthy
[50:11] desiring to please her husband that
[50:12] she's a benefit and a compliment to him
[50:14] and her family she's willing to work
[50:16] for her household and for its debt it's
[50:18] it's
[50:19] it's benefit
[50:20] she's prudent
[50:22] strong hard working i'm just summarizing
[50:24] these verses here
[50:27] she plans
[50:28] diligently plans for the future she's
[50:30] diligent
[50:31] generous
[50:33] she's a faithful teacher of her children
[50:36] she teaches kindness to others she's
[50:38] frugal and financially disciplined and
[50:39] the bible says she's god-fearing
[50:42] you take these characterizations of this
[50:43] woman she's industrious she's smart
[50:45] she's ambitious she's prudent she's
[50:47] strong she she has some wisdom
[50:49] concerning the future she has wisdom in
[50:51] how to treat others this is
[50:53] the woman is a remarkable
[50:55] remarkable calling
[50:58] and this is how the bible describes a
[51:00] virtuous woman
[51:03] and i would say that modern society or
[51:06] maybe we could use the terminology
[51:08] laodicean spirit pressures a woman
[51:10] to alter her expectations or to alter
[51:12] her roles
[51:14] but this is true of a virtuous woman
[51:15] precious trustworthy
[51:17] a benefit a compliment strong
[51:19] industrious hard-working diligent
[51:21] forward-looking generous a faithful
[51:23] teacher
[51:24] kind
[51:25] disciplined financially and one that
[51:27] fears the lord
[51:29] but the time and age that we're living
[51:31] in i'm going to read this statement from
[51:32] the laodicean
[51:34] church age chapter 9 of the church age
[51:35] book he's referring to laodicea says the
[51:37] city was rich
[51:38] endowed by the wealthy
[51:40] it was full of culture
[51:43] science abounded
[51:45] how like today the churches are rich the
[51:48] worship is beautiful and formal but cold
[51:51] and dead now ponder this full of culture
[51:53] science abounded like today
[51:57] now notice what he says culture and
[51:59] education have taken the place of the
[52:02] spirit given word and faith has been
[52:05] superseded by science so that man is a
[52:08] victim of materialism
[52:10] i want you just to hold that think of
[52:12] that culture and education taking the
[52:14] place of the spirit given word so the
[52:16] word is displaced by culture and
[52:17] education
[52:19] and faith is displaced by science
[52:22] culture education and science now have
[52:25] the preeminence in the age he says so
[52:27] that man is a victim of materialism
[52:31] culture education and science causes
[52:34] mankind to be victims of materialism he
[52:37] says in every attribute laodicea is
[52:39] found
[52:40] reborn in the 20th century laodicean age
[52:44] and even in this 21st century
[52:47] now he says that
[52:49] culture i want you to just kind of hold
[52:52] this in your minds i know this might
[52:53] seem to be
[52:54] um a little bit dry to you and i
[52:56] apologize culture education and science
[53:00] have replaced replaced faith in the word
[53:03] and the product is a victim of
[53:05] materialism materialism is to consider
[53:08] material possessions or physical
[53:10] comforts more important than spiritual
[53:11] values
[53:12] materialism relates to being preoccupied
[53:15] with those comforts material comforts
[53:17] disinterested in spiritual things
[53:18] materialism is tangible it's what
[53:22] satiates the flesh it's what satisfies
[53:24] uh your immediate needs and you're more
[53:26] concerned about material possessions
[53:27] you're more concerned about consumption
[53:30] than you are about the value of your
[53:31] spirit or what you're doing to your mind
[53:33] or spiritual things that's what
[53:35] materialism means
[53:37] it's what's tangible it's what's
[53:39] evidence what's seen
[53:41] it's those codes of consumption that uh
[53:43] professor twitchell was talking about
[53:45] but he says that they're they're a
[53:47] victim of materialism
[53:50] think about victim and it's etymology
[53:52] and you only have to think about it you
[53:54] can listen to it
[53:55] because i'm going to tell you about it
[53:57] when he says it's a victim of
[53:59] materialism i want you to think more
[54:01] broadly than oh materialism came by and
[54:03] kicked me in the knee
[54:05] but its culture education and science
[54:08] have caused the person to be a victim of
[54:11] materials materialism is doing something
[54:14] but it's not that you're the innocent
[54:15] bystander a victim is a living creature
[54:18] killed and offered as a sacrifice to a
[54:20] false deity or a consecrated animal
[54:22] that's why his first you or originally
[54:24] used this word in the 15th century in
[54:27] the 16th century it was a person who's
[54:28] hurt tortured or killed by another
[54:31] the 17th century it began to use as a
[54:33] person oppressed by some power situation
[54:35] or a person taken advantage of we live
[54:38] in a time when everybody's the victim
[54:41] everybody is woe is me i've been
[54:43] aggrieved i've been offended and i'm
[54:44] telling you we got to be very very
[54:46] careful or that spirit that's just on
[54:47] the age where everybody's a victim and
[54:50] everyone has a victim mentality
[54:51] mentality
[54:52] we may be persecuted we may be laughed
[54:55] at we may be made fun of the fun of our
[54:58] doors may be shut our charter could be
[55:01] canceled non-profit status can be taken
[55:03] away but i want you to understand we are
[55:05] never going to be the victim
[55:07] you're always going to be the victor
[55:09] because in all these things you're made
[55:10] more than a conqueror christians never
[55:13] have a scriptural right to be victims
[55:16] to make myself out to be a victim i'm
[55:18] the victim i'm the victim i'm the victim
[55:19] i'm the victim no you have one who is
[55:21] your victor and he's one that can redeem
[55:24] you he's one that can give context to
[55:26] these things you may be somebody else's
[55:28] victim but you are christ's victory
[55:31] therefore we do not need to have a
[55:33] victim mentality
[55:35] yeah i've been victimized by this i've
[55:36] been victimized by that i've been made
[55:38] fun of i've been laughed at i've been
[55:39] abused i've been mistreated i've been
[55:41] all these things have happened and that
[55:42] makes you a victim in that context but
[55:44] we are taught that we are his victory
[55:48] therefore we don't have this victim
[55:49] mentality but the spirit on the age has
[55:52] made people to be something that is
[55:54] sacrificed for something else
[55:57] and oppressed
[55:59] by materialism taking advantage of by
[56:02] materialism
[56:03] and the more i thought about the phrase
[56:05] victim of materialism through culture
[56:07] education and science culture education
[56:09] and science has have made the people
[56:11] victims
[56:12] the very things that claim to liberate
[56:14] women have are exploiting them
[56:17] the very things that claim to liberate
[56:20] them are victimizing them
[56:22] why because at the end of the day it's
[56:23] about consumption
[56:25] it's about economics
[56:27] it's about materialism
[56:31] you still with me
[56:33] it's 11 35.
[56:35] do you know where your mom is
[56:39] i read an article in the smithsonian a
[56:41] few years ago
[56:42] it was just a small little excerpt and
[56:44] the title was did women stop being
[56:45] charming three decades ago
[56:47] this is the question that was asked
[56:50] and it's kind of an odd question you
[56:51] know what do you mean why didn't how did
[56:53] women stop being charming three decades
[56:54] ago
[56:55] and as you ponder that just look at the
[56:57] title there's this
[56:58] this is me i summarized the summary but
[57:01] researchers analyzed over 79 000
[57:04] american texts they included novels
[57:07] nonfiction writings periodicals
[57:09] magazines newspapers and they examined
[57:11] the words in these american texts 79 000
[57:15] and they studied more than 500 different
[57:17] words related to personality
[57:19] identified those words tied most closely
[57:22] to women they also did it with men but
[57:24] i'm just summarizing about the women and
[57:26] then traced how these
[57:28] words relating to a woman's personality
[57:31] how they changed or how the the usage
[57:33] changed or the descriptions changed as
[57:36] attitudes towards
[57:37] the gender evolved and changed so you're
[57:40] looking at over 79 000 uh writings from
[57:44] 1910
[57:45] in that decade and they they analyzed
[57:48] them and they they found words
[57:49] descriptive of women's personalities
[57:50] they began to rake which words were used
[57:52] the most and then looked at it over this
[57:55] um
[57:56] in this case it was over a hundred year
[57:58] period to say well look at how the what
[58:01] they're wanting to see is how have
[58:02] descriptions of women and men changed as
[58:05] our attitudes towards gender have
[58:07] changed
[58:08] and in 1910
[58:10] these were the top five words associated
[58:12] with
[58:13] a woman charming
[58:15] placid
[58:16] delicate
[58:18] passionate
[58:19] sweet these are things that would have
[58:20] been found in novels non-fiction books
[58:22] periodicals newspapers magazines uh
[58:25] historical books a woman was top five
[58:27] charming placid delicate passionate
[58:30] sweet these all these words except for
[58:32] maybe placid might find their way into a
[58:34] mother's day card today
[58:36] and these are all posi these are good so
[58:38] i've kept them kind of in their pristine
[58:40] white charming placid delicate
[58:42] passionate suite fast forward 80 years
[58:45] to 1990
[58:47] and number one was maternal but then the
[58:49] next three morbid artificial
[58:52] physical and thank god for the bookend
[58:54] of caring
[58:55] or that could have ended really really
[58:57] dark
[58:58] of course there's five other ones and
[58:59] the other ones too were a little um
[59:01] weren't always
[59:03] maybe as
[59:05] wonderful as maternal and caring but
[59:06] notice how different
[59:08] but vince could you go back to 1910 not
[59:10] literally there you go
[59:15] charming placid delicate passionate
[59:17] sweet
[59:19] and you go before 80 years
[59:21] maternal which was in kind of the list
[59:22] before and go to the next slide
[59:24] maternal morbid artificial physical
[59:29] these are the words that enter in to the
[59:31] descriptions of women
[59:33] in 1980 number three was masculine
[59:38] wait hold on what
[59:40] in the top five descriptions of a woman
[59:42] masculine was number three this is what
[59:44] was stood out in the 80s now i want you
[59:46] to consider the i want to compare
[59:49] for a moment
[59:51] some of the standout ones from 1910 and
[59:53] that of 1990 charming means pleasant
[59:55] polite friendly
[59:57] you might think placid seems a little
[59:59] interesting but it means even tempered
[1:00:01] a woman was not easily upset or excited
[1:00:04] she was charming and placid and delicate
[1:00:06] passionate sweet these are very um
[1:00:09] uh these are these denote a particular
[1:00:12] nature
[1:00:13] that you could associate with the woman
[1:00:14] with the mom
[1:00:16] but then you get to 1990 and you say
[1:00:19] maternal that's good but morbid
[1:00:21] artificial
[1:00:22] morbid means diseased looking like death
[1:00:24] or subject to death
[1:00:26] if something is morbid they're subject
[1:00:28] to death death is clinging to them if
[1:00:30] they're artificial they're not natural
[1:00:32] they're not genuine
[1:00:34] women have now are no longer just
[1:00:36] maternal or caring or charming or sweet
[1:00:38] but now there is a morbidity to them
[1:00:40] there's an artificialness to them
[1:00:42] there's a physicality to them there's a
[1:00:43] masculinity to them and this is the
[1:00:45] language that's being used of the woman
[1:00:47] in the periodicals in the novels in the
[1:00:49] in the magazines in the in the books
[1:00:52] and it's used to indicate how the
[1:00:54] attitude towards women had changed
[1:00:58] through time
[1:00:59] and it stood out to me how that
[1:01:02] women are being described as morbid and
[1:01:04] artificial
[1:01:05] in ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 26 he
[1:01:07] says i find more bitter than death the
[1:01:09] woman
[1:01:10] whose heart is snares and nets and her
[1:01:12] hands as bands
[1:01:15] more bitter than death is a woman
[1:01:17] the woman
[1:01:18] whose heart is a snare and a net her
[1:01:21] hands as bands who so pleaseth god shall
[1:01:24] escape from her but the sinner shall be
[1:01:26] taken by her captured seized trapped
[1:01:28] drawn to her
[1:01:30] there's an image of a woman that may be
[1:01:32] charming and delicate and passionate
[1:01:34] sweet maternal and caring but there's
[1:01:36] also this other image of a woman that is
[1:01:38] masculine and morbid and artificial and
[1:01:40] physical and he says it's going those
[1:01:42] that please god will escape that image
[1:01:45] but the sinner is taken by it drawn into
[1:01:48] it
[1:01:49] more bitter than death is the woman
[1:01:52] the scripture has already described that
[1:01:55] the woman is ultimately going to come to
[1:01:56] this place where she's morbid
[1:02:00] she's she's subject to death she's not
[1:02:02] natural she's not genuine
[1:02:05] and just to bring it up into the more uh
[1:02:07] the time that we're living in now
[1:02:09] in 2018
[1:02:12] this is a top 10 calm
[1:02:15] ruined careless gracious sentimental
[1:02:18] mistaken humorous fearful proud
[1:02:21] passionate
[1:02:23] and look at how many of those
[1:02:26] how this description of a woman ruined
[1:02:30] is number two careless mistaken
[1:02:33] fearful proud
[1:02:38] this is how women
[1:02:40] are being portrayed
[1:02:42] because the attitude towards women has
[1:02:44] changed
[1:02:47] and it's through time forces have
[1:02:48] changed the woman's disposition
[1:02:52] and driven her from her office
[1:02:55] there's a certain attitude that is
[1:02:57] suitable for a wife and a mother certain
[1:02:59] attitude suitable for certain callings
[1:03:01] and even labors that would be
[1:03:03] um
[1:03:05] you know outside the home there's a
[1:03:06] certain nature and that would be
[1:03:09] beneficial to these different callings
[1:03:11] but time through time
[1:03:13] as attitudes have changed towards gender
[1:03:15] there's been forces that have caused her
[1:03:18] to change her disposition
[1:03:20] a woman who is charming and and not
[1:03:23] easily excited and delicate and
[1:03:25] passionate and sweet isn't suited for
[1:03:27] just any calling in life
[1:03:31] a woman who's maternal and caring
[1:03:34] is suited for particular things but
[1:03:36] maybe there needs to be a certain
[1:03:37] artificialness or physicalness or
[1:03:40] certain morbidity maybe a certain
[1:03:42] rumoredness and and pride
[1:03:45] to a woman in order for her to step into
[1:03:47] other roles
[1:03:49] brother bam says in the church age book
[1:03:51] chapter six he says now a woman is not
[1:03:52] meant to have an iron disposition you
[1:03:55] see a woman with one she's not meant to
[1:03:56] have it
[1:03:59] she is according to the holy scripture
[1:04:00] to be submissive to the male that is
[1:04:02] commanded of her
[1:04:04] woman who is truly female all female
[1:04:06] will be of that disposition do you think
[1:04:08] it was for a reason some of these
[1:04:09] phrases are used and iron-clad and
[1:04:12] really we couldn't argue i don't know if
[1:04:13] we have the same things that the mormons
[1:04:15] could do or we can just black out and
[1:04:16] white out our church history but these
[1:04:18] things are out there for anyone to hear
[1:04:20] and go listen to
[1:04:22] a woman who's truly female all-female
[1:04:24] will be of that disposition not a
[1:04:26] doormat
[1:04:27] no real male makes a female a doormat
[1:04:30] i'm glad he said it that way because
[1:04:32] sometimes it seems that males want to
[1:04:34] treat
[1:04:35] a woman like a woman because she's not a
[1:04:37] lady but he says a male never makes a
[1:04:39] female a doormat
[1:04:42] but she will want to be under authority
[1:04:44] and not rule over the mail for he is the
[1:04:46] head of the house if she breaks that
[1:04:48] image that god made for her she is
[1:04:50] perverted
[1:04:52] i miss his heavy stuff i recognize that
[1:04:54] in the day and age that we're living in
[1:04:55] uh there's uh there's a stigma that can
[1:04:59] be placed on this there's a scarlet
[1:05:00] letter that you could carry if you say
[1:05:02] well the woman's place is in the home
[1:05:04] and and she should be submissive to the
[1:05:06] male i know that's got a lot of shock
[1:05:08] value it seems in the world today but
[1:05:10] nonetheless it's what the bible says
[1:05:13] it's what the bible teaches
[1:05:15] and brother branham's identifying how a
[1:05:17] woman's disposition has changed we see
[1:05:20] it just in the from the 1910s to the
[1:05:22] 1990s to 2018 there are certain
[1:05:25] qualities and characteristics of the
[1:05:26] woman that just get lost and other ones
[1:05:28] start to come up why her disposition is
[1:05:31] changing
[1:05:33] it's the inherent qualities of mind and
[1:05:34] character disposition is a frame of mind
[1:05:36] an attitude a disposition is an
[1:05:38] inclination are you inclined to do
[1:05:40] something at one time a woman was
[1:05:42] charming and placid and delicate but now
[1:05:44] she's morbid and artificial and physical
[1:05:46] her disposition is changing
[1:05:50] he says the image that god made for her
[1:05:52] it's a god-ordained disposition for a
[1:05:55] woman to step into
[1:05:57] it's part of it's part of your dna
[1:06:00] that your hormones ought to be promoting
[1:06:03] and the world is working really really
[1:06:04] hard through sculpture science and
[1:06:06] education to do what force you to not
[1:06:10] walk into the image that god has of a
[1:06:12] woman and conform to culture science and
[1:06:15] education and they'll even use science
[1:06:17] to the utmost to change you
[1:06:20] all we gotta fix for that what they do
[1:06:21] they just give you shots to change your
[1:06:23] hormones
[1:06:24] force your body to change
[1:06:28] the disposition of a woman is changing
[1:06:33] proverbs chapter 11 verse 22
[1:06:35] i don't know maybe maybe some of you
[1:06:36] thinking this is a happy mother's day
[1:06:38] thing
[1:06:39] oh my goodness
[1:06:41] well happy mother's day anyways
[1:06:45] this is really going to help proverbs 11
[1:06:46] 22.
[1:06:50] a jewel of gold and a swine snout
[1:06:53] so is a fair woman which which is
[1:06:55] without
[1:06:58] discretion this is a this is a a
[1:07:01] fascinating statement just to ponder
[1:07:02] maybe get the picture right
[1:07:04] you just think about a pig with a
[1:07:06] a gold ring in its nose
[1:07:10] it says that is the same as a woman
[1:07:12] without discretion discretion is taste
[1:07:14] or judgment
[1:07:15] and so it speaks of thought process and
[1:07:17] and thus in through thought process it
[1:07:20] speaks of choices and behaviors
[1:07:22] so a woman who's not thinking correctly
[1:07:23] and not behaving correctly is just like
[1:07:26] he says a fair woman a beautiful woman a
[1:07:28] fair woman who would not have discretion
[1:07:31] is like putting a gold a jewel in a
[1:07:33] pig's nose
[1:07:35] a woman without taste that the the way
[1:07:37] the scripture is expressing a woman
[1:07:39] without discretion is a woman without
[1:07:40] taste she's void of tact
[1:07:42] she's void of grace his brother branham
[1:07:44] says a woman of an iron disposition a
[1:07:46] woman without discretion is harsh she's
[1:07:48] hard she's bitter she's aggressive
[1:07:51] a woman without discretion is anti-woman
[1:07:55] because a woman is made to have
[1:07:56] discretion a woman is natured to have
[1:07:58] discretion a woman without a fair woman
[1:08:00] without discretion he says it's like a
[1:08:02] woman without grace intact is like a
[1:08:04] gold ring in a pig's nose
[1:08:07] unless we forget uh what is meant there
[1:08:09] we all love bacon but to the jews this
[1:08:12] would have been an unclean animal
[1:08:16] this would not be well you know a ring
[1:08:17] on a pack of bacon would just be the
[1:08:19] ultimate proposal
[1:08:22] but that's not the case here a pig
[1:08:24] adorned with gold is the same as a woman
[1:08:26] adorning herself in the wrong image
[1:08:28] it's incongruent you don't put jewel
[1:08:30] jewels in a pig's nose that's not that's
[1:08:33] not what it's made for so a woman
[1:08:34] without discretion without judgment a
[1:08:36] woman whose disposition has changed
[1:08:38] where she's harsh she's bitter she's
[1:08:40] aggressive that's the wrong image
[1:08:42] brother bam said if that changes then
[1:08:44] she's perverted she's become iron she's
[1:08:47] become hard
[1:08:50] and it should be just as increment for
[1:08:52] incongruent for a woman to be that as it
[1:08:54] would be to see jewelry on a pig
[1:08:58] and so proverbs says in proverbs 31 i
[1:09:01] want to read verse 25 but i want to just
[1:09:03] kind of capture
[1:09:05] the trajectory of it in verse 20.
[1:09:15] i might have the wrong
[1:09:17] wrong verse here but it's she that fears
[1:09:19] the lord
[1:09:21] in verse 30
[1:09:23] it says she feareth the lord not verse
[1:09:25] 20
[1:09:26] a woman that feareth the lord
[1:09:30] this is strength and honor her clothing
[1:09:32] in verse 25.
[1:09:34] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:09:38] a woman that fears the lord a virtuous
[1:09:40] woman i love the bookkins a woman that
[1:09:42] fears the lord a virtuous woman
[1:09:46] he says give her the fruit of her hands
[1:09:47] and let her own works praise her in the
[1:09:49] gate she's worthy of this honor she's
[1:09:51] worthy of recognition
[1:09:54] give her the fruit of her hands let her
[1:09:55] own works praise her in the gates we
[1:09:57] stand here in the gates today to give
[1:09:59] her of the works of her hands to praise
[1:10:00] her in the gates she's clothed
[1:10:03] in strength and honor she's clothed with
[1:10:04] moral character
[1:10:06] strong in honorable
[1:10:08] speaks of strength of mind and charity
[1:10:10] and resolve
[1:10:12] what does culture and science rob the
[1:10:14] woman of
[1:10:15] her true strength or true power
[1:10:17] through culture education and science
[1:10:20] and the world devalues virtue
[1:10:24] strength and honor are her clothing just
[1:10:25] read proverbs 31 just try it with
[1:10:28] somebody said well i'm a proverbs 31
[1:10:30] woman and they're and they'll
[1:10:31] immediately start to think of what that
[1:10:32] means and what it represents and it's
[1:10:34] antiquated and it's the it's the results
[1:10:36] of a patriarchy and it's the results of
[1:10:37] misogynism it's results of chauvinism
[1:10:40] and there's a way that they want to
[1:10:41] characterize it to demean and devalue
[1:10:44] how you feel in your heart
[1:10:47] what you feel you want to be that's why
[1:10:49] again i love the special that was sung i
[1:10:52] choose to be
[1:10:53] there's so much pressure now to where if
[1:10:56] if a young girl said i want to get
[1:10:58] married i want to have children i want
[1:11:00] to serve my husband i want to be a good
[1:11:03] mother they would think oh
[1:11:05] where did you get that idea why would
[1:11:07] you want to do that don't you realize
[1:11:08] there's so many more opportunities and
[1:11:10] women are the future baby come on you
[1:11:12] need to get on board and they would make
[1:11:14] someone feel guilty for choosing that
[1:11:17] and and and then they express this
[1:11:19] disgust and this disdain
[1:11:22] and and they they're shocked and
[1:11:23] horrified you would think that she said
[1:11:25] she wanted to be a man
[1:11:28] with the way that they act
[1:11:30] and the way they respond
[1:11:32] why because the world has devalued
[1:11:33] virtue and womanhood
[1:11:36] and therefore
[1:11:37] motherhood
[1:11:39] you know why they devalue it
[1:11:42] it's it's because those things empower a
[1:11:45] godly woman
[1:11:48] it says she shall rejoice in time to
[1:11:50] come she smiles at the coming day
[1:11:52] she's not fearful
[1:11:54] she doesn't fear the future she looks
[1:11:55] forward to the future
[1:11:57] she looks forward to the future without
[1:11:59] anxious care
[1:12:00] she looks forward to the future
[1:12:01] confident
[1:12:04] wow that's the power of her office
[1:12:08] a virtuous woman
[1:12:10] womanhood motherhood there's power in
[1:12:12] her office there's power in her life
[1:12:14] which are it's the life of a woman
[1:12:15] there's power in her works she shall let
[1:12:18] the let give her the fruit of her hands
[1:12:19] let her own works praise her in the
[1:12:21] gates there's power in her works of
[1:12:23] motherhood
[1:12:25] and we went as we looked at in the
[1:12:26] beginning
[1:12:28] god ordained god has ordained
[1:12:31] the office of a mother
[1:12:33] he's ordained the form he go back to the
[1:12:35] beginning god was intentional god was
[1:12:37] purposeful he ordained the form and the
[1:12:39] purpose of a woman
[1:12:41] it's his design it's his divine will
[1:12:44] and there's a lot of things that could
[1:12:45] be said about a woman's weakness
[1:12:48] because things said that's about
[1:12:50] what what aren't her strengths
[1:12:52] strength may not be spirit physical but
[1:12:55] her spiritual strength
[1:12:57] is tremendous
[1:12:58] her moral strength is tremendous a real
[1:13:01] woman is a wonder
[1:13:04] but satan remembers her designer now
[1:13:07] and he's designed her to be degraded
[1:13:10] designed her to be devalued in order to
[1:13:12] rob the woman of her true power
[1:13:14] and i believe that so many images of
[1:13:16] women or men that want to be women are
[1:13:18] lifted up today in order to portray a
[1:13:20] godly woman is weak
[1:13:22] powerless undesirable
[1:13:25] but a real woman a real woman in her
[1:13:27] place lacks a strength and ability
[1:13:30] which no a female can match
[1:13:32] a real woman in her place has a strength
[1:13:35] and ability that no female can match
[1:13:37] so i as i close this i have some
[1:13:39] statements i want to read to you
[1:13:41] and maybe we'll just read them as we
[1:13:42] close
[1:13:43] but i say don't let the devil change
[1:13:45] your perceived value
[1:13:49] don't let it cost fear
[1:13:51] hopelessness despairing of the future i
[1:13:53] imagine it could be quite scary maybe
[1:13:55] for some of our young people to consider
[1:13:56] the future of marriage the future of
[1:13:58] relationships the future of work
[1:14:00] but don't let any of that scare you
[1:14:02] i say it's time to return to the office
[1:14:07] to embrace embrace womanhood rejoice in
[1:14:11] and celebrate
[1:14:12] motherhood musicians if he could come
[1:14:16] the sermon in the flashing red light
[1:14:17] brother bram said there's nothing that
[1:14:18] god could give a man outside of
[1:14:19] salvation better than a nice wife
[1:14:22] there's no man can console no person can
[1:14:24] console a person when they're tired they
[1:14:26] won't confide in anyone like they do
[1:14:28] their own wife
[1:14:31] what a fortunate thing you brothers are
[1:14:32] when you've got a nice little wife
[1:14:33] that's clean and upright and moral you
[1:14:35] can come home to when you're tired and
[1:14:36] weary and sit down and she can talk to
[1:14:38] you she can do more with you than
[1:14:40] anybody else that's right she's a jewel
[1:14:43] she is a queen
[1:14:45] i'm sure the children feel the same way
[1:14:47] about their mother
[1:14:48] it's in the creation story
[1:14:50] that the first thing that god ever gave
[1:14:52] man was a woman
[1:14:54] she's a jewel she's a queen
[1:14:58] and the sermon patriarch abraham not to
[1:15:00] trigger anybody by using the word
[1:15:01] patriarch
[1:15:04] and all the witches said no
[1:15:08] is just something i'd seen in witches
[1:15:10] versus the patriarchy i guess it's a
[1:15:11] movement now
[1:15:13] but by the he says brother ram's
[1:15:14] respondent says by the way what does a
[1:15:16] christian girl want to show her
[1:15:17] underneath skirt for he says i can't
[1:15:19] understand that he's just talking about
[1:15:20] what they call scandal skirts or the
[1:15:23] splits to show the
[1:15:24] undergarment he says you're born again
[1:15:25] of god you got the beauty of the holy
[1:15:27] ghost to show what you are
[1:15:29] you've got virtue that these scandal
[1:15:31] skirts don't have
[1:15:32] that's right a real woman of god that
[1:15:35] stands out with virtue
[1:15:37] so you might be laughed at
[1:15:39] called old-fashioned
[1:15:41] but you got something that they can't
[1:15:42] touch
[1:15:44] and done lost it and can never have it
[1:15:46] again
[1:15:48] he said that's right
[1:15:50] you've got virtue that's something to
[1:15:52] protect
[1:15:53] something to uphold
[1:15:56] i believe that
[1:15:59] god has blessed us
[1:16:01] in our midst and our presence today real
[1:16:03] mothers
[1:16:06] there's a
[1:16:07] reality to relationships that i
[1:16:11] we can acknowledge
[1:16:13] that
[1:16:16] mothers may not be perfect but they can
[1:16:18] be perfect mothers
[1:16:21] and there's mistakes that are made
[1:16:24] and there's slip ups and there's
[1:16:25] failures and maybe it's easier sometimes
[1:16:27] to just look back on a day like today
[1:16:29] i'm like well i'll take all i can today
[1:16:31] because as i look back in my past i
[1:16:33] don't always see a faithfulness a
[1:16:35] fidelity i don't always see that i was
[1:16:37] doing the right things i haven't always
[1:16:39] had the right approach i've made a lot
[1:16:42] of mistakes
[1:16:43] but that quality
[1:16:45] that god has ordained in you that part
[1:16:48] of himself that he's put inside of you
[1:16:50] to manifest his image that's still in
[1:16:52] womanhood today
[1:16:55] that's still in motherhood today
[1:16:57] and if there's a way any way that you
[1:16:59] could in your heart say lord please
[1:17:00] forgive me if you failed
[1:17:03] forgive me if i haven't done things
[1:17:04] right
[1:17:05] and embrace the challenge that you have
[1:17:07] today in whatever calling you're in
[1:17:09] whatever time of life you're in embrace
[1:17:10] the challenge today i want to be that
[1:17:12] godly woman that the scripture speaks of
[1:17:15] and i would say which i believe i'm
[1:17:17] speaking to everyone that's here today
[1:17:20] let's just take a moment i believe i
[1:17:21] could say as a man as a husband
[1:17:24] as a father as a brother in christ thank
[1:17:26] you
[1:17:27] for your virtue thank you for your stand
[1:17:29] thank you for your perseverance
[1:17:31] with so much pressure that exists in the
[1:17:33] world today within families within
[1:17:35] culture within science within education
[1:17:38] very very near to us even in fractured
[1:17:40] relationships there's an aggressiveness
[1:17:41] there's an agenda there's an agenda
[1:17:43] there's an intimidation when a woman is
[1:17:45] happy in her place
[1:17:47] by choice
[1:17:50] so anymore maybe just using the the
[1:17:52] absolutes of a woman's place is what
[1:17:55] gets people all offended but you could
[1:17:56] just have took my i've taken my place
[1:17:59] i'm happy where i am i've chosen to
[1:18:01] return to the office
[1:18:04] i've chosen to return to the office i'm
[1:18:06] coming i'm happy to step in to womanhood
[1:18:09] i'm happy to step into motherhood
[1:18:11] because that's my calling that's my
[1:18:13] disposition is suited for this and i say
[1:18:16] god bless you to all of our mothers that
[1:18:18] are here mothers expecting mothers
[1:18:20] mothers to be those who desire that
[1:18:22] office and that calling god bless you
[1:18:24] today i may his honor be to you
[1:18:28] may you be receive the fruit of your
[1:18:29] hands and may your works praise you
[1:18:32] in your gates
[1:18:33] god bless you today if we could stand
[1:18:35] together
