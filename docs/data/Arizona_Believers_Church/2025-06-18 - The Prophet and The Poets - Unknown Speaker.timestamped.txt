[0:00] Acts chapter 17 verse 28
[0:04] he says for in him we live and move and
[0:08] have our being as certain also of your
[0:10] own poets have said for we are also his
[0:14] offspring. It's a really short verse. So
[0:16] let's just read it again. For in him we
[0:18] live and move and have our being as
[0:20] certain also of your own poets have said
[0:23] for we are also his offspring. You can
[0:27] be seated.
[0:29] My title is the prophet and the poets.
[0:32] It's going to be a very uh specific uh
[0:34] combining together of those two phrases,
[0:36] the poets and the prophet. And so my
[0:39] title being the prophet and the poets.
[0:41] Going to look at Acts chapter 17. In a
[0:44] lot of ways, there's going to be some
[0:45] historical emphasis and just digging
[0:47] into some of the details and the facts
[0:49] here as Paul addressed the men in Athens
[0:52] and really wanting to cover the context
[0:54] of just a small part of Paul's ministry,
[0:56] but yet a very important one. And as we
[0:59] go through some history and some facts
[1:01] about Athens and even some of the things
[1:03] that Paul is saying here, it's not
[1:05] solely academic because there's a lot to
[1:07] learn from it. Scripture was given to us
[1:09] for our learning, for our benefit. And
[1:12] even understanding the context and what
[1:13] is meant is beneficial to us. And as we
[1:17] look at, I hope that you can do
[1:18] something to see the the social and
[1:21] political climate that Paul is facing in
[1:23] that day uh is applicable to the day
[1:26] that we live in now. what we see then at
[1:28] the outset of the gospel going to the
[1:30] Gentiles, we see now in the time that
[1:32] we're living in, there's a lot of
[1:34] parallels. And so what we're looking at
[1:36] here and even in this picture that we
[1:38] have here presented as an artistic
[1:39] rendering from the 1700s of Paul
[1:42] standing there in Mars Hill, uh,
[1:44] preaching the gospel and sharing these
[1:46] things with the men and visitors there
[1:48] in Athens. And as the gospel is going to
[1:51] these other nations or as the Bible
[1:53] would call them Gentiles, God is using a
[1:56] prophet and the prophet is using poets.
[1:59] And it's something very special to see
[2:01] here and learn. And I think it's
[2:02] exciting just to kind of understand
[2:04] better even what Paul was using because
[2:06] for us we want God to use us today. Uh
[2:09] we want to know understand better how we
[2:11] can be a witness. And so here we can see
[2:13] even more details on the art of
[2:15] witnessing and then even ourselves being
[2:16] a work of God. So, if you just look at
[2:19] verse 16 in the same chapter, I'm not uh
[2:23] feeling rushed or anything, but I just
[2:25] have a very short thought to share and I
[2:28] trust it' be a blessing to you. We are
[2:30] still on Europe time and so I'm liable
[2:33] to fall asleep at 4:00 in the morning,
[2:35] my body's time. Uh but you just pray for
[2:38] all of us. If you see my family
[2:39] sleeping, it's not because they've just
[2:40] checked out on my ministry. It's because
[2:42] they're tired. Acts 17:16, it speaks in
[2:46] the prior verse how that Paul, excuse
[2:48] me, Silas and Timothy uh are going to be
[2:51] coming uh to Athens as well. But it
[2:54] says, "Now why Paul waited for them at
[2:56] Athens, his spirit was stirred in him
[2:59] when he saw the city wholly given to
[3:01] idolatry." So just imagine what he's
[3:04] experiencing and what he is seeing. He
[3:06] says, "Therefore disputed he in the
[3:08] synagogue with the Jews and with the
[3:10] devout persons and in the market daily
[3:12] with them that met with him." So there's
[3:14] a lot here that's being presented just a
[3:16] couple sentences and kind of outlining
[3:18] the scene as Paul arrives in Athens and
[3:21] it says that he sees the idolatry. He's
[3:23] kind of moved in his spirit, moved with
[3:26] compassion. And then it says that he
[3:28] disputed, but the word there means he
[3:29] held conversations. he spoke or even he
[3:31] preached with them the Jews, the devout
[3:34] persons and those in the market that met
[3:36] with him and this time that Paul is
[3:40] arriving on the scene uh in that first
[3:43] century
[3:44] kind of look at Athens historically
[3:46] during Greece's golden age. Athen was
[3:48] the home to many great philosophers.
[3:50] Socrates, Pericles, Plato were some of
[3:53] the ones that you would recognize at
[3:54] their names. It was a center of
[3:56] philosophy and science and literature,
[3:58] art. uh there was a great ancient
[4:01] university that was founded there. It
[4:02] was an intellectual meeting place and so
[4:05] it was a thriving city. It's known as
[4:08] the birthplace of western civilization.
[4:11] And in the first century maybe it was
[4:13] living a lot on its past glory and its
[4:14] former glory in prior centuries. And
[4:18] this place here where Paul is the
[4:20] Acropolis, that high city, it held many
[4:23] fifth century buildings. And so he's
[4:25] amongst these at Mars Hill there. He's
[4:27] amongst just a lot of beautiful
[4:28] architecture and even the testimony to
[4:31] just how great great the uh Greek Empire
[4:33] was in the city of Athens. And as Paul
[4:36] is standing there, Athens is so full of
[4:38] idolatry that he's provoked. He he got
[4:41] he has to preach the gospel. He's not
[4:43] going to wait for Silas and Timothy to
[4:45] show up. He begins to speak and share
[4:47] the gospel. And in verse 18 it says,
[4:50] 'Then certain philosophers of the
[4:52] Epicurans and of the Stoics encountered
[4:54] him, and some said, "What will this
[4:57] babbler say? Others, some, he seemth to
[5:00] be a setter forth of strange gods
[5:02] because he preached unto them Jesus and
[5:05] the resurrection." So each one of these
[5:07] responses that are being provided here
[5:09] speaks to how those in Athens were
[5:12] receiving the things that Paul was
[5:14] sharing with them. The Epicurans and the
[5:16] Stoics as they are hearing what he's
[5:18] saying, they call him a babbler or they
[5:20] say he's setting forth strange gods,
[5:22] which is kind of interesting considering
[5:24] just all the deities uh that they
[5:26] believed in. But to them, it was a new
[5:28] god. It was a something different that
[5:29] they had seen before because now he's
[5:31] preaching one Jesus who's raised from
[5:34] the dead, which would have challenged a
[5:36] lot of notions that they had in their
[5:38] philosophies. Bear with me as we look at
[5:41] this. The Epicurans, they followed the
[5:43] ancient Greek philosopher Epicurius. Uh
[5:46] he himself as a philosopher is kind of
[5:48] come trying to come up with a practical
[5:50] guide for happiness. And you don't need
[5:51] to write the name down because he
[5:53] doesn't really provide it. But his
[5:55] philosophy emphasized the pursuit of
[5:57] happiness through attaining pleasure and
[5:59] avoiding pain. And we all said that
[6:02] sounds reasonable. You know, avoid pain
[6:04] and obtain pleasure. That was kind of
[6:06] his philosophy. So he advocated for
[6:08] moderation. uh but then also this
[6:11] intellectual contemplation and he
[6:13] focused they focused on the natural
[6:15] world and the things around them and the
[6:16] human experience that we have in it
[6:18] maximize pleasure reduce pain. They
[6:21] believed in materialism the things that
[6:22] could be seen the things that could be
[6:24] felt and because they were so focused on
[6:26] how can we get as much pleasure out of
[6:28] the world and keep ourselves from as
[6:29] much pain as possible they were really
[6:31] skeptical of anything that they deemed
[6:33] to be superstitious and they didn't
[6:35] believe in divine revelation. These are
[6:37] just the Epicurans how they lived and
[6:39] they kind of felt that well our life is
[6:41] going to end one day. So basically
[6:42] there's nothing better than to just
[6:44] enjoy ourselves. There was no higher
[6:46] purpose to life. They didn't think that
[6:48] there was something in the end that they
[6:49] would face on the other side of death.
[6:52] So any belief that presented the
[6:55] supernatural or that was based upon or
[6:57] that spoke of life after death, the
[7:00] epician just said this is just this is
[7:02] just the fear of man coming up with
[7:04] something to plate our minds because of
[7:05] his apprehension of our condition and
[7:08] what's going to be when we die. And so
[7:10] they were skeptical of any religion that
[7:11] spoke of something after death. The
[7:14] Epicurans together with the Stoics and
[7:17] the Skeptics formed a significant part
[7:19] of the Hellenistic philosophy that
[7:21] predominated Greek Greece. Now the
[7:24] Stoics, it's spelled with the K here.
[7:26] Kind of like this spelling, but you
[7:27] might find it to be spelled differently.
[7:29] The word stoic comes from just even the
[7:31] portico or the porch from where they
[7:33] spoke and delivered these things. Now,
[7:35] you're thinking, "Wow, I I did I I
[7:37] didn't take philosophy in college just
[7:39] for this very reason that I'm
[7:40] experiencing right now." But this is in
[7:42] the Bible. These are some things that we
[7:43] can gather and understand who was Paul
[7:45] talking to who is he addressing and
[7:47] what's interesting for myself is I gave
[7:49] myself some time saying who are the
[7:50] epicurans today who are the stoics today
[7:53] how does it look today when we face a
[7:55] similar situation and the stoics they
[7:57] believe that the universe operated
[7:59] according to reason and that god a god
[8:02] or this divine power was in nature
[8:04] itself and you might have heard of some
[8:06] of the great minds in stoicism cynica
[8:09] marcus Aurelius uh were the some of the
[8:12] proponents of stoicism. In a lot of
[8:15] ways, the stoics were the opposite of
[8:17] the Epicurans. So now you have two
[8:19] opposing factions that are gathering
[8:20] together to listen to Paul. And their
[8:23] ethics in a lot of way protested that
[8:25] moral indifference of the Epicurans. And
[8:28] it was they taught harmony with nature.
[8:31] They taught that there was a universal
[8:32] good. And their fundamental maxim or
[8:35] teaching was there was you should have
[8:37] this indifference to pleasure and pain
[8:39] and all external good or evil. Uh but
[8:42] you but you to uh to live a moral life.
[8:45] A lot of ways people say that
[8:46] Christianity is based on some of the
[8:48] same thoughts of the stoics but really
[8:50] theirs was in the basis of pride. But
[8:52] both the Epicurans and Stoics, so
[8:55] regardless of what human philosophy you
[8:56] held, they respond to the gospel with
[8:58] skepticism. They call him a babbler or
[9:01] ridicule. But yet the newness of it kind
[9:03] of intrigues him a little bit. So in
[9:05] verse 19, they the Epicurans and the
[9:07] Stoics and those that encountered him
[9:09] took him and brought him unto Aropagus.
[9:12] So now they're going to Mars Hill.
[9:13] They're wanting to go to this place
[9:15] where he can share more of what he
[9:16] believes. And they can examine this,
[9:18] saying, "May we know what this new
[9:20] doctrine whereof thou speakest? For thou
[9:23] bringest certain strange things to our
[9:25] ears, we would know therefore what these
[9:27] things mean." And then there's context
[9:29] given in verse 21 kind of uh what
[9:32] they're thinking and what's in their
[9:33] heart. For all the Athenians and the
[9:34] strangers which were there spent their
[9:36] time in nothing else but either to tell
[9:39] or to hear some new thing. This was the
[9:41] original Twitter.
[9:43] These this was the original forums and
[9:46] the doom scrolling. They just showed up
[9:48] because they wanted to hear something
[9:49] new, a new take, something different.
[9:51] And so really what we see here is this
[9:52] Athenian character. What was new was
[9:55] already at the present becoming stale.
[9:57] And so they wanted they crave something
[10:00] more new. Speaks to the day and age
[10:02] we're living in now where the very
[10:04] moment that you get something brand new.
[10:06] It's already as soon as you have it and
[10:09] and peeled off the sticker, it's already
[10:11] become old and the clock is ticking when
[10:13] you're going to feel like ah I really
[10:14] want to replace this with something
[10:16] else. And so the Atheians were even
[10:18] though there was new things coming,
[10:20] they're already getting old to them. And
[10:21] they wanted, they craved. What is it
[10:23] this Paul is saying? This this babbler
[10:26] saying because maybe this is something
[10:27] else we could sink our teeth into and
[10:29] learn from. But now in verse 22, it
[10:32] says, "Then Paul stood in the midst of
[10:33] Mars Hill and said, "Ye men of Athens, I
[10:36] perceive that in all things you are too
[10:39] superstitious.
[10:41] For as I passed by and beheld your
[10:43] devotions." Now, if we could just pause
[10:44] for a moment, what Paul says here is
[10:46] he's he's not wanting to offend them. I
[10:49] mean, he's just kind of been brought to
[10:50] this great court or this gathering area
[10:52] to speak to these people and these
[10:54] learned men and these wise men and these
[10:56] philosophers, strangers from all over
[10:58] the world and people coming to this
[10:59] area. He's not wanting just to come
[11:01] right out and punch them in the face.
[11:03] But he commends their dedications when
[11:05] it says you are too superstitious. He's
[11:07] saying you're greatly addicted to
[11:08] religious practices. You're much given
[11:10] to uh religious worship. There's a
[11:13] dedication and a ferveny there. So, it's
[11:15] not that he's saying, "Hey, I think you
[11:16] guys are a little bit overblown here."
[11:18] But he's commending them for being
[11:19] seekers for their worship. He says, "For
[11:21] as I passed by and beheld your
[11:23] devotions, and these would be different
[11:25] uh works of art that were consecrated to
[11:27] their religions or their beliefs. And he
[11:29] beholds one among many that references
[11:32] the unknown or hidden God." It says,
[11:34] "For I beheld this inscription.
[11:37] I I found on an altar with this
[11:39] inscription to the unknown God, whom
[11:41] therefore ye ignorantly worship, him I
[11:45] declare unto you." Now this would have
[11:48] been an attention getter I think because
[11:50] amongst all their their works of art and
[11:52] their erections of of figures and
[11:55] pillars and devotions and altars uh they
[11:58] had different gods and different beings
[12:00] and deities and things that they would
[12:01] revere and they would be images of
[12:03] long-held beliefs and philosophies. But
[12:06] there's one that's to this hidden god or
[12:08] this unknown god and maybe one uh that
[12:10] to the the stoics was hidden in nature
[12:13] or this one that you couldn't really
[12:15] deeply know personally and yet they
[12:17] worshiped at this and he's saying this
[12:19] one that you do not know that you
[12:21] worship not knowing him I'm going to
[12:23] make him known to you.
[12:26] So he's actually pointing to something
[12:28] that they had amongst themselves that
[12:30] they worshiped. And so he recognizes
[12:34] this work of art of theirs, this uh
[12:37] devotion, and he's wanting to bring the
[12:40] gospel to those who've been influenced
[12:42] by the philosophies of the ancient
[12:44] world. There's going to be a way that
[12:45] they think. There's a way that they
[12:47] process information. He's already heard
[12:49] them calling him a babbler and an offer
[12:50] of strange gods. And so Paul is very
[12:54] much aware of who his audience is. It's
[12:57] in the context of the city of Athens.
[12:59] It's audience of Athenians and
[13:01] strangers. And so this place where he's
[13:04] speaking and those that are around him
[13:06] give us are helpful or important to what
[13:09] he says.
[13:11] I'm just failing to remember now just
[13:12] exactly in Acts. It might have been a
[13:14] chapter 16 or maybe 18 where uh we use
[13:17] the phrase that when in Rome do as the
[13:19] Romans and how that Paul was very
[13:21] careful about Timothy being circumcised
[13:24] but Titus not being circumcised based
[13:26] upon the audience and the one to whom
[13:28] they're trying to influence and gain and
[13:30] win to the Lord. And so this city of
[13:34] Athens could boast that it produced some
[13:36] of the greatest artists, the greatest
[13:38] writers and the greatest thinkers and
[13:39] philosophies that the world had ever
[13:40] known. called Athens the cradle of
[13:43] democracy. It was a a center of
[13:46] learning. It was a leader of the
[13:47] civilized world. And now Paul is saying
[13:50] there's things that you don't know that
[13:52] you have just accepted as being unable
[13:54] to be known. And I want to make that
[13:56] thing known to you. And he begins in
[13:58] verse 24 by saying God that made the
[14:01] world and all things therein, seeing
[14:03] that he is Lord of heaven and earth
[14:06] dwelleth not in temples made with hands.
[14:10] There's a he's obviously speaking to
[14:13] something that would be contrary to an
[14:15] idea that they held before. We could
[14:17] erect an image or an altar and we could
[14:19] say that this embodies a deity or a
[14:21] thought or God is in all nature or God
[14:22] is in this institution. He's saying this
[14:25] Lord, this God of heaven and earth and
[14:27] remember that phrase, this Lord of
[14:28] heaven and earth because he's not
[14:30] speaking to Jews. Right. He He's not
[14:33] preaching to those who believe that God
[14:35] was in heaven and that the tabernacle
[14:37] that they worshiped in was made after a
[14:39] pattern of what was in heaven. He's
[14:40] speaking to those who did not know the
[14:42] one true God and actually referred to an
[14:45] unknown God that could not be known. And
[14:47] he says he is Lord, this God, this
[14:49] unknown God who dwells in heaven. He
[14:52] created all the heavens and the earth
[14:54] and he is in heaven and earth, but he
[14:56] dwells not in temples made with hands.
[14:59] Neither is worship with men's hands as
[15:01] though he needed anything seeing he
[15:02] giveth to all life and breath and all
[15:05] things.
[15:06] Uh let each one of these elements kind
[15:08] of hold in your mind as he's saying he's
[15:10] lord of heaven and earth. He dwells not
[15:12] in temples made with hands. He's neither
[15:14] worshiped with men's hands as though he
[15:16] needed anything. And then he says see if
[15:17] he giveth to all life, breath, and all
[15:20] things. Going to find that this is
[15:22] something that they would have said.
[15:23] Okay. Yeah, I I see what you're saying
[15:25] there. I believe that. He says, "And he
[15:27] made of one blood all nations for men to
[15:30] dwell on all the face of the earth and
[15:33] had determined the times before
[15:34] appointed in the bounds of their
[15:36] habitation."
[15:37] In a lot of ways, what what Paul is
[15:40] doing is he's affirming some things and
[15:42] then contradicting others. And this is a
[15:46] by the way he puts this forth how that
[15:48] God has set and determined the times
[15:50] before appointed. It's a rejection of
[15:52] the the chance of the Epicurans that
[15:54] just get as much as you can out of life
[15:56] and avoid as much pain as possible and
[15:57] the fate of the Stoics who held to
[16:00] things maybe being more predetermined.
[16:02] So in both ways he's kind of or he's or
[16:04] the fate of Stoics rather that they just
[16:06] kind of they they followed something uh
[16:09] unseen. So he kind of rejecting both of
[16:12] their ideologies and it possibly could
[16:14] have been offensive to the Athenians who
[16:16] thought did not think that all mankind
[16:18] was the same. they were very much uh
[16:21] looked down upon the barbarians and the
[16:23] uneducated. So Paul is not just kind of
[16:26] uh
[16:28] turning upside down everything they
[16:29] believe, but nor is he just patting them
[16:31] on the back and saying everything you
[16:32] think is believe is well. But look at 1
[16:35] Corinthians chapter 9 22 and 23.
[16:40] We're making such great time tonight. I
[16:41] love it. This is wonderful.
[16:44] And even if it would just be a half
[16:45] hour, there's enough here for us to chew
[16:48] on, to think about, to ponder, to
[16:50] consider. In 1 Corinthians chapter 9, I
[16:52] just made some people hopeful that it
[16:53] could indeed be a half hour. 1
[16:56] Corinthians chapter 9:es 22 and 23. Kind
[16:58] of like how brother Reggie said in
[17:00] closing. And I had the benefit of being
[17:02] able to see just how much longer he
[17:03] preached. And I'm thinking, okay, all
[17:06] right. I like this. We're getting some
[17:07] we're having some precedent for a
[17:08] 30-minute close. In 1 Corinthians
[17:11] chapter 9 22 and 23 he says the weak
[17:13] became to the weak became I as weak.
[17:15] Remember to the Jew a Jew to those with
[17:17] the law as with the law and those
[17:20] without the laws without the law. He
[17:21] says to the weak became I weak that I
[17:23] might gain the weak. I have made all
[17:25] things to all men that I might by all
[17:27] means save some. He knew he couldn't
[17:29] save them all. But he would become to
[17:31] all men something to them so that he
[17:34] could save them. And this I do for the
[17:36] gospel's sake. Not his own. Not for
[17:38] popularity. Not for acceptance. not
[17:40] acceptance or his ego, but I do this for
[17:42] the gospel sake that I might be a
[17:43] partaker thereof with you.
[17:46] As you look into these scriptures and
[17:47] find what Paul is saying and preaching
[17:49] here to the Athenians, you find that he
[17:51] was earnestly trying to adapt the gospel
[17:53] to his audience. He was doing the best
[17:57] he could to find look in their heart and
[17:59] find something common and something that
[18:01] he could use to provoke so that he could
[18:04] by all means gain some. Right. So in
[18:08] verse 27, he says that they should seek
[18:11] the Lord. As we go back to Acts chapter
[18:12] 17, he says, "This God who made the
[18:15] world and all things therein, he's made
[18:18] of one blood all nations to dwell that
[18:20] they should seek the Lord." This is what
[18:22] all humanity should do. He's not making
[18:24] a distinction among the Greeks or the or
[18:27] the Jews or the barbarians. He's saying
[18:29] we're all men of the same blood. and
[18:31] that all of us, not just the learned,
[18:33] not just the citizens of Greece or or
[18:35] the citizens of Rome, uh they should all
[18:38] seek the Lord if happily they might feel
[18:40] after him and find him though he be not
[18:43] far from every one of us. This is a
[18:47] great contradiction to them as they have
[18:49] already set in stone and kind of given
[18:52] God his ultimate description, the
[18:54] unknown God. He is not one that we can
[18:57] feel after and find. He's not one that
[18:59] is nearest. He's he's beyond. But he
[19:02] says, "For in him we live and move and
[19:06] have our being." How many have heard
[19:08] this preached on even by myself preached
[19:10] on how in him we live and move and have
[19:12] our being that our existence is in God
[19:14] and our animation in life is in God. Our
[19:16] identity is in God. But he's speaking to
[19:18] them and to them they're picking up what
[19:20] he's laying down. He says, "For in him
[19:21] we live and move and have our being is
[19:23] certain also of your own poets." So
[19:26] here's the prophet and now here's your
[19:28] poets. your own poets have said, for
[19:30] you're also his offspring. Paul's not
[19:33] talking to the Jews whose poets would
[19:35] have been David or the poets would have
[19:37] been a prophet or a writer of an of a
[19:39] the Old Testament. He's speaking to the
[19:42] Greeks. Your own poets, your own Grecian
[19:45] poets have said, "For you're also his
[19:47] offspring."
[19:49] To reach this audience of unbelievers,
[19:52] Paul quotes their popular culture.
[19:55] He's quoting from even their own belief
[19:57] system and their own writings. He quotes
[19:59] famous Grecian poets and he's showing
[20:02] that he's familiar with their culture.
[20:03] So he's showing that oh this isn't just
[20:05] somebody coming here to tell us what to
[20:07] do but he shows he's familiar with their
[20:08] writings, their beliefs and their
[20:10] culture. And he uses at this time in
[20:12] this first century he's using popular
[20:14] lingo and ideas of the Stoics and the
[20:16] Epicurans that would have been relevant
[20:18] in the first century Athens. And even by
[20:21] doing this he's using some say well why
[20:24] would he quote a Greek poet to try to
[20:26] support what he's saying? Bless God. He
[20:28] should just give the proverbs. Just read
[20:30] Isaiah the prophet. Tell him what Elijah
[20:32] is going to do when he comes back. But
[20:34] he uses he enhances his argument by
[20:36] using the authority that even the
[20:38] Athenians would respect.
[20:41] He said you you believe this yourself
[20:43] and you understand this yourself. And
[20:45] this is the phrase for we are also his
[20:48] offspring. This is what he says. For
[20:49] also of your own poets plural have they
[20:52] have have said for we are also his
[20:53] offspring.
[20:55] Word for word. It's the first half of
[20:57] the fifth line of an astronomical poem.
[21:00] It is a phrase from a famous poem called
[21:03] phenomena phenomena by artistus of Solai
[21:08] and that's is uh I don't know how old
[21:10] this printing is but that's in the
[21:11] Greek. He was a Greek poet of Salissia.
[21:14] You might remember that that's a place
[21:15] that was familiar to Paul. It's a native
[21:17] place of Paul. He wrote this about 277
[21:21] years before Christ. Historically after
[21:23] the Iliad and the Odyssey, Phenomena was
[21:25] one of the most widely read poems in the
[21:27] ancient world. It's translated in Latin
[21:29] by Oid and Cicero. It was one of the few
[21:31] Greek poems translated into Arabic.
[21:33] Arabic. It was something that would have
[21:34] been known to the the Greeks. Maybe not
[21:38] to a Jew, but maybe those who learned
[21:39] there. Uh maybe not something understood
[21:42] by Christians uh in Jerusalem, but this
[21:44] is something that Paul knew that they
[21:46] knew. Something Paul may have learned as
[21:48] a child having been from Cissia and him
[21:51] being learned himself.
[21:52] says here is that he quotes from their
[21:54] own poet. He quotes from this famous
[21:56] poem and what it says here that is
[21:59] recorded here in the Greek and all you
[22:00] Greek I can tell you people who know
[22:02] Greek you're already way ahead of me
[22:03] here but this is the full poem and then
[22:06] it comes to that that word for word the
[22:08] first half of the fifth line is for we
[22:10] are also his offspring but as I read
[22:13] this notice just how closely he's
[22:15] already tracking it in his sermon on
[22:17] Mars Hill let us begin from Job
[22:21] let every mortal raise his grateful
[22:23] voice to the tune to tune Job's endless
[22:26] praise. Job here is Zeus or Jupiter.
[22:30] Job fills the heaven, the earth, the
[22:32] sea, the air. Notice how closely this is
[22:35] to what he has said previously. We feel
[22:37] his spirit moving here and everywhere
[22:39] for we are also his offspring. He quotes
[22:43] it word for word. He's tracking even in
[22:45] in this that we seen he give all life
[22:48] and breath and all things.
[22:51] And so he's weaving in and out. Let us
[22:52] begin from Job. Let us begin from Zeus.
[22:54] Let us begin from Jupiter. Let every
[22:57] mortal raise Zeus's grateful voice to
[22:59] the tune to tune Zeus's endless praise.
[23:03] Zeus fills the heaven, the earth, the
[23:05] sea, the air. We feel his spirit moving
[23:07] here and everywhere. For we are also his
[23:10] offspring.
[23:12] These words are also found in a hymn
[23:14] written by Cleanths entitled him to
[23:17] Jupiter.
[23:19] Cleanths was a stoic philosopher. He was
[23:21] a genuinely religious man. He was
[23:23] someone that is very devoted. This hymn
[23:26] that he wrote is considered one of the
[23:27] most noble pieces of natural religion or
[23:29] pagan religion in the whole world of
[23:31] pagan antiquity.
[23:33] It is viewed as a a great uh hymn or
[23:37] poem but to a pagan deity
[23:40] because to a stoic now think about this
[23:42] just how incredible this is. He says to
[23:44] the unknown god and Paul preaches this
[23:45] sermon. It's just such an incredible
[23:47] just a few words that we see here in
[23:49] these few sentences. But to a stoic like
[23:51] Cleanths, God was unknown, right? He was
[23:55] this unknown living power that was
[23:57] imminent in nature and he could not be
[23:59] personal, could not be discovered, could
[24:01] not be handled, could not be felt, could
[24:03] not be sought after and known. But yet
[24:05] he's saying that we might feel after him
[24:08] and find him because he's not far from
[24:10] every one of us. And he's actually
[24:12] pointing out some inherent contradiction
[24:13] to say, well, you believe that you're
[24:15] his offspring, but you can't know him as
[24:17] a father. You can't seek him or find
[24:19] him. He's in everything and everywhere.
[24:22] And so here in this hymn to Jupiter here
[24:26] you could see it's written in the Greek
[24:27] but this is how it's written. This is
[24:29] the phrase is here in this and where it
[24:31] resolves on a similar phrase of we are
[24:33] also his offspring. Most glorious of
[24:36] immortals mighty God invoked by many a
[24:39] name. Oh sovereign king of universal
[24:41] nature piloting this world in harmony
[24:44] with law. Very astute observations.
[24:48] Remember the Jews knew God because he
[24:51] manifested himself to them, spoke to
[24:53] them. They heard his voice and said,
[24:55] "Don't talk to us anymore. Let your
[24:56] prophet speak to us." But to the Greeks,
[24:59] they didn't know him. To the Gentiles,
[25:02] they didn't know him. But yet, there is
[25:03] some knowledge of God as some divine.
[25:05] There there's some kind of inspiration.
[25:07] He's a universal.
[25:10] He's everywhere. They invoke him by many
[25:12] different names, but he pilots this
[25:13] world in harmony with law. Glenthy's uh
[25:16] hymn to Jupiter covers these like 40some
[25:20] different constellations. It's a very
[25:22] it's much larger than just the portion
[25:23] we're reading here. It says, "All hail
[25:26] thee. It is meat that mortals should
[25:28] invoke. For we thine offspring are
[25:33] soul of all created things that live and
[25:35] move on earth receive from thee the
[25:36] image of the one. In him we live and
[25:39] move and have our being." the soul of
[25:41] all created things that live and move on
[25:44] earth receive from thee the image of you
[25:48] of the one for we thine offspring are
[25:52] they worshiped a god they didn't know
[25:54] they used phrases of most glorious
[25:56] immortal mighty God sovereign king
[26:00] the creator
[26:02] from which all life springs let us begin
[26:05] from Job let every mortal raise his
[26:07] grateful voice to tune Job's endless
[26:09] praise Jehovah fills the heaven, the
[26:11] earth, and sea. We could very well say,
[26:13] "Let us begin from Jehovah."
[26:16] Let every mortal raise his grateful
[26:17] voice to tune Jehovah's endless praise.
[26:19] Jehovah fills the heaven, the earth, the
[26:21] sea, the air. We feel his spirit moving
[26:23] here and everywhere. For we are also his
[26:25] offspring.
[26:26] You'll find that a lot of the
[26:27] philosophers spoke of God, spoken of a
[26:30] deity and a divine, but they didn't know
[26:31] him in the way that a Jew would know
[26:33] him. They certainly didn't know him in a
[26:34] way that a Christian could know him
[26:35] before there was even a Christ. Right?
[26:37] So, we can see they're wrestling with
[26:39] something as Plato said, "God is in no
[26:41] wise and in no manner unrighteous, but
[26:43] utterly and perfectly righteous." And
[26:46] there's nothing so like him as that one
[26:47] of us who in turn becomes most nearly
[26:50] perfect in righteousness. It is herein
[26:52] that the true cleverness of a man is
[26:54] found and also his worthlessness and
[26:55] cowardness. For the knowledge of this is
[26:58] wisdom
[27:00] or true virtue, and ignorance of it is
[27:01] folly or manifest wickedness. He's
[27:04] saying a whole lot that we might think
[27:05] could be written in the New Testament.
[27:07] Something that could have been written
[27:08] in our Old Testament. God is not
[27:10] unrighteous, but he's utterly perfect.
[27:14] And there's nothing like him.
[27:16] And if there's any true cleverness, it's
[27:18] found in this in this understanding. For
[27:22] knowledge of this is wisdom and true
[27:23] virtue. The fear of the Lord is the
[27:24] beginning of wisdom.
[27:27] But to ignore the ignorance of this is
[27:28] the folly or manifest wickedness. This
[27:30] is Plato. But what is he speaking of?
[27:32] form a form of good.
[27:35] He's not speaking of the one true God
[27:37] through knowledge or revelation, but
[27:38] he's thinking in terms of his philosophy
[27:40] trying to deduce things of man and what
[27:42] would be and give meaning. He says these
[27:44] forms of good that he saw these
[27:45] different forms. Here was this form of
[27:47] good, this abstract transcendent entity
[27:49] entity that he felt served for the
[27:52] foundation of all morality and truth.
[27:55] And he would call him Zeus, Jupiter,
[27:57] Jove or God.
[28:00] But he's not the God that the Hebrews
[28:02] knew.
[28:04] Even though it's the same God, he didn't
[28:07] know him like the Jews knew.
[28:10] Paul said it this way in Ephesians
[28:12] chapter 4 vers 17, 18, and 19. I think
[28:16] we've read these even recently, so we
[28:17] could just kind of bounce right over. He
[28:19] says, "This I say therefore, and testify
[28:21] in the Lord, that you henceforth walk
[28:22] not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity
[28:25] of their mind." Right? Not necessarily
[28:28] shallow, ignorant, barbaric creatures,
[28:29] but in the vanity of their philosophies,
[28:33] and the way that they're trying to
[28:35] explain everything and understand
[28:36] everything that just got them further
[28:37] and further at God, from God, having the
[28:40] understanding darkened, being alienated
[28:42] from the life of God through the
[28:43] ignorance that is in them because of the
[28:46] blindness of their heart, who being past
[28:48] feeling have given themselves over into
[28:50] lasciviousness,
[28:52] to work all uncleanness with greediness.
[28:55] avoid all pain and get as much pleasure
[28:57] as you can. The Epicurans, the Stoics,
[29:00] whatever branch of philosophy that you
[29:02] chose to accept without a revelation of
[29:03] God, it was all, it was worthless. It
[29:06] was ignorance.
[29:08] In Romans 1:es 20 to 23, for the
[29:11] invisible things of him from the
[29:12] creation of the world are clearly seen
[29:14] being understood by the things that are
[29:15] made, even his eternal power and
[29:17] godhead, so that they are without
[29:20] excuse. Plato is without excuse. He
[29:23] wrote so pointedly about it. He could
[29:25] see certain things. But yet there's
[29:27] something that they failed to seek,
[29:29] something they failed to desire. They
[29:30] build up this wall where he cannot be
[29:32] known. He says, "Because that when they
[29:33] knew God, they glorified him not as God,
[29:35] neither were thankful, but became vain
[29:37] in their imaginations. The foolish heart
[29:39] was dark and professing themselves to be
[29:41] wise, they became fools, and changed the
[29:44] glory of the uncorruptible God into an
[29:45] image made like to corruptible men and
[29:48] to birds and to for-footed beasts and
[29:49] creeping things." In some ways, he has
[29:52] just summarized all Greek mythology, the
[29:54] religions of man and all their ways of
[29:56] trying to explain creation and tell
[29:58] stories of with the the the heroic arc
[30:00] and these different journeys and ways
[30:02] that they tried to just summarize how we
[30:04] all got here and where we're going and
[30:06] these great moralities and truths. It
[30:07] says they could have known God, but they
[30:10] became vain,
[30:12] became fools.
[30:15] And here the Epicurans and the Stoics
[30:17] could use a language of a God who is a
[30:19] no why and no no wise and in no manner
[30:21] unrighteous.
[30:23] One whom every mortal should raise their
[30:24] grateful voice to. The one that fills
[30:26] the heaven, the earth, the sea, whose
[30:28] spirit moves here and everywhere. The
[30:30] one who is the most glorious of
[30:31] immortals. The invoked by many a name,
[30:33] the sovereign king of nature, palading
[30:36] the world in the harmony in harmony with
[30:37] law. They can see not only that he was a
[30:39] creator, but he was a sustainer.
[30:42] For we are also, they say, his
[30:43] offspring. For we thine offspring are
[30:46] the soul of all created things that live
[30:48] and move on earth. Quite a quite an
[30:52] understanding on some level tapping into
[30:54] some great truth.
[30:57] But then Paul says, "Your own poets
[31:00] have said that we are also his
[31:02] offspring." So verse 29, Acts chapter 17
[31:05] 29, he says, "For as much then as we are
[31:08] the offspring of God," he's using their
[31:11] language.
[31:13] Maybe if it was in today's terms, it
[31:16] might have not been that they not like
[31:18] us, it'd be like we're like him.
[31:21] Use a language they could understand.
[31:25] We ought to not think that the Godhead
[31:28] is like unto gold or silver or stone
[31:30] graven by art in man's devices. He's in
[31:33] the center of arts.
[31:36] The the man's devices is in the center
[31:37] of man's devices and intellect and
[31:39] knowledge and wisdom. He's not like gold
[31:41] or silver or stone graven by art and
[31:42] man's devices. These are the things that
[31:44] they would have thought God has
[31:45] represented in and dwelt in.
[31:48] In the times of this ignorance, this is
[31:51] really escalates. The time of this
[31:53] ignorance, God winked at. There was a
[31:55] time when God would have forgiven you
[31:57] and just looked right past it when you
[31:58] ought to have known him. He became vain
[32:00] in your imaginations. There's a time
[32:01] when your own ignorance about this
[32:03] unknown god that you worshiped, he would
[32:05] have winked at. But now commandeth all
[32:07] men everywhere to repent. Amen. Because
[32:10] he hath appointed a day in which that he
[32:12] will judge the world in righteousness by
[32:14] that man whom he hath ordained. Amen.
[32:17] Because they believed in righteousness.
[32:19] They believed that there was some maybe
[32:20] attaining too righteous. There's nothing
[32:23] so like him as that one of us who in
[32:25] turn becomes most nearly perfect in
[32:27] righteousness. Plato speaking of this
[32:30] almost alluding to the stature of a
[32:32] perfect man and one that be could become
[32:34] perfectly righteous holding no one
[32:36] righteousness. And now he says that
[32:38] there the times of your ignorance of God
[32:42] are over. And you now have to repent for
[32:45] not knowing him because there's going to
[32:47] come a day when he's going to judge the
[32:48] world by that one whom he has ordained
[32:51] this righteous man. He never names the
[32:53] name. You'll find that there on Mars
[32:55] Hill. He never invokes the name of
[32:56] Jesus. Never invokes the name of Christ
[32:59] as much as we could see here as he may
[33:01] have done earlier in the markets. But
[33:03] now he says he's appointed a day in
[33:04] which he'll judge the world by it
[33:06] righteous by that man whom he hath
[33:08] ordained. Who is this man? Who is this
[33:10] righteous one? Wherefore he's given
[33:12] assurance unto all men and that he
[33:14] raised him from the dead.
[33:17] Now here's your strange God. You know,
[33:20] it's really good for us to think about
[33:21] this because we're we're raised in
[33:23] Christian homes, raised most of us in
[33:26] message believing homes and there's a
[33:28] lot of things that we believe and are
[33:29] very familiar to us and we just kind of
[33:31] accept them as true and real. But
[33:33] really, if you think about it from maybe
[33:35] a heathen standpoint, like come on,
[33:38] seriously, run that by me one more time.
[33:41] Tell me again what this however it is
[33:44] you came up with this story of this one
[33:47] who died and rose again and and now
[33:49] you're going to be baptized in water and
[33:51] your spirit's going to return. You're
[33:52] going to do this and you're going to do
[33:53] that. But he's saying it with such
[33:55] authority. He's raised him from the
[33:57] dead. And when they heard of the
[34:00] resurrection of the dead, some mocked.
[34:04] They laughed at him, scorned him. And
[34:06] others said, "We will hear thee again on
[34:08] this matter." In other words, it's more
[34:09] their itching ears and says, "So Paul
[34:12] departed from among them."
[34:18] He leaves
[34:20] Mars Hill. You just look at the sermon.
[34:22] The sermon is very short,
[34:25] but it was so rich. It was maybe in some
[34:27] ways akin to the Gettysburg Address.
[34:31] He's not blustering for hours upon
[34:33] hours, but he comes and he just delivers
[34:35] something very short but very memorable.
[34:39] Something that spoke to the moment, to
[34:41] the need. Athens is the birthplace of
[34:44] modern civilization.
[34:46] To me, represents the seed of Satan's
[34:48] Eden.
[34:50] Today, it's an unknown Christ.
[34:53] Think of the parallel. To them they had
[34:55] a language that described a deity and a
[34:57] god.
[34:59] But now it's an unknown Christ. Despite
[35:02] the hymns, the praise, the lip service
[35:04] to Christ, he's become an unknown
[35:06] Christ.
[35:08] And though we stand amongst different
[35:10] cathedrals and devotions and altars,
[35:13] they worship a God they don't really
[35:15] know. They know him in language. They
[35:18] know him in phrases. They know him in
[35:19] forms. But yet, do they truly know him
[35:22] as they ought to know him?
[35:24] Paul castigated them for their
[35:26] ignorance. Brother Brandham, the
[35:27] indictment says, 'Now what do they do?
[35:29] They don't know it. They didn't know it.
[35:31] Today, men walk ignorantly. I know I
[35:34] read this statement quite a bit. He
[35:35] says, but today men walk ignorantly.
[35:37] They don't know that's the truth. They
[35:39] think it's some kind of ism, right? That
[35:41] we could have branches of philosophy. We
[35:43] could have schools of philosophy and
[35:45] thought, well, my take on it is this and
[35:47] my take isn't on that. in religion and
[35:49] Christianity has become nothing more
[35:50] than another Athens with different
[35:52] schools of phil philosophy, Epicurans
[35:55] and Stoics and skeptics.
[35:58] He says they don't dig down deep enough
[35:59] to get in the spirit of revelation. They
[36:01] don't pray enough. They don't call upon
[36:02] God enough. They just take it. Oh, well,
[36:05] I believe they just lightly take it. Oh,
[36:07] I believe there's a God. Sure. Plato
[36:09] believed in a God. Socrates believed in
[36:11] a God. Aristotle believed in a god. The
[36:14] Epicurans, the Aratus, Cleanths,
[36:18] Pericles, Marcus Aurelius,
[36:21] Plutus Maximus, they all believed.
[36:25] They all believed in God. He says the
[36:27] devil believes the same thing. The devil
[36:28] believes it's more than some people
[36:30] claim to believe it. The devil believes
[36:31] it and trembles. People just believe it
[36:33] and go on. But the devil trembles
[36:35] knowing his judgment's coming. And
[36:37] people believe it and don't pay
[36:38] attention to the judgment coming. This
[36:40] is exactly what Paul is saying.
[36:42] He said, "Listen, you can debate this
[36:44] all you want to, but time's up. There's
[36:47] no more debating. There's no more
[36:48] pouring through this trying to figure
[36:50] out, well, which philosophy explains
[36:51] life better." He says, "You got to come
[36:53] and repent."
[36:58] Guilty of crucifying him. I indict this
[37:00] generation, finding them guilty by the
[37:01] same word that found them guilty at the
[37:03] beginning. Jesus said, "Who can condemn
[37:05] me?" He was the word made flesh. And
[37:06] today, the same word is made flesh.
[37:12] there upon that hill that day, Paul the
[37:15] prophet was preaching Christ.
[37:18] And it says that they begin to laugh at
[37:19] him, mock him,
[37:23] and he leaves.
[37:25] And in verse 34, as he's leaving, and it
[37:28] might seem to be that his sermon or what
[37:31] he had to share was without effect, but
[37:33] as he's leaving, it says, "Certain men
[37:36] clave unto him and believed.
[37:41] Among the witch was Deionius,
[37:44] the Aeropagite, Pagite, and a woman
[37:47] named Dearis, and others with them. This
[37:49] one Dionys was a judge in the court
[37:52] there at Aropagus. He was one that would
[37:54] sit and judge. He was a learned man. He
[37:56] was a devout man.
[37:58] And the prophet used the poets
[38:01] to catch the attention of those that
[38:03] were ordained eternal life. It may have
[38:06] seemed as if it was rejected. And on a
[38:07] whole, we could say yes, it was rejected
[38:09] and everything he was doing, it wasn't
[38:11] to save them all, but he labored to save
[38:13] the sum. And he quotes from this these
[38:15] different poems. He uses a sermon that
[38:17] weaves in and out of the one the the
[38:20] phenomena, the one that would weave
[38:21] through the hymn of Jupiter. And he's
[38:22] saying, "There's a little bit here you
[38:24] have. There's a little bit here you
[38:25] have. But let me tie it together to show
[38:26] you what you're missing."
[38:29] Paul used the arts to portray a gospel
[38:32] in a real relatable and relevant way to
[38:36] save some.
[38:38] Even if it was just those two,
[38:41] it was worth it.
[38:43] Paul, as I've studied this and looked at
[38:45] this, he delivered a master class to the
[38:47] Athenians that day.
[38:49] A and it wasn't again, it wasn't over on
[38:52] and on. You're just reading chapter 20,
[38:54] chapter 30, chapter 40, and he's just
[38:55] going on and on and on. I My sermon
[38:57] tonight is much longer than what his
[39:00] was.
[39:02] But he does something in a way to
[39:03] present to them things that they
[39:05] revered, things that they believed in,
[39:07] ideology that they had. And he says,
[39:08] "Look, your own prophets have written
[39:10] these poems. They've sang these songs.
[39:13] They've given these hymns. This is what
[39:15] they believed." And do you not realize
[39:16] that the hope of everything they're
[39:18] speaking of here, you can know? He
[39:21] showed them and identified where the
[39:22] leaven was, where the heir was.
[39:26] And I want us to kind of take a cue from
[39:28] that. I'm just there there's a lot that
[39:30] could be said even about that phrase. We
[39:31] were also his offspring. Isn't there a
[39:33] great truth in that
[39:35] that we come from God? You go and find
[39:37] in the end of brother Brandon's ministry
[39:39] over and over again, your life, your
[39:40] life was from him. There's this germ.
[39:42] There's this beginning. And he's
[39:44] eliciting this very thing that we come
[39:46] from God
[39:48] in the identified masterpiece of God. He
[39:50] says, "Brethren, God had a masterpiece
[39:52] then to present the world to the world."
[39:56] Jesus Christ, he was that identified
[39:58] masterpiece of God. Now we see Paul
[40:00] preaching a masterpiece and given a
[40:02] master class on Christ, preaching this
[40:04] masterpiece that was rejected and
[40:06] crucified, but then rose on the third
[40:08] day. And brother Bam says now he wants a
[40:09] masterpiece today.
[40:12] And he says, 'Are you willing?
[40:14] Are you ready, my Christian friend? Why?
[40:17] Because God wants to present a
[40:19] masterpiece to the world today.
[40:23] There has to be some presentation today
[40:26] of Christ.
[40:28] He says, "Are you really sure that your
[40:30] life is so reflecting Christ? No matter
[40:32] what the world says, they say you lost
[40:34] your mind. You gone crazy. You went and
[40:36] joined that bunch of holy rollers. Don't
[40:37] pay no attention to that. If you're not
[40:39] really truly saved and in the body and
[40:41] the word of God in you and reflect
[40:42] itself and the life of Christ reflecting
[40:44] out of you, brother, sister, don't you
[40:46] take that chance. I don't care what you
[40:48] are, what kind of experiences you have.
[40:50] Let that word reflect through you each
[40:53] day because God in this last days has
[40:56] taken a bride for his son Jesus Christ.
[41:00] I believe that your life in some ways
[41:01] should be a master class to those that
[41:04] can relate to you, right?
[41:07] that we could be praying and asking God,
[41:09] "How is it that I can
[41:12] so not so much preach a sermon like Paul
[41:14] did and his education and his knowledge
[41:16] and his connection to the Greeks and
[41:19] even his reading himself of these?" He's
[41:22] quoting the poets. Why? Because he knew
[41:24] him. He didn't have chat GPT to write a
[41:26] sermon for him. What poets, what
[41:30] philosophers could I quote in a a homaly
[41:32] here? What could I give in a haik coup
[41:34] in such a way to where I can get this
[41:37] across in a way that uses their sayings
[41:40] and their belief systems but yet
[41:41] presents Jesus Christ. He knew it. He
[41:44] was familiar with it. But I said, "God
[41:47] will always bear witness. Your life will
[41:49] bear witness." He says, "I don't know
[41:51] what your testimony is." This is in the
[41:53] Hebrew series. He says, "I don't know
[41:54] what your testimony is, but your life
[41:55] speaks so loud your voice can't be
[41:57] heard."
[41:59] He says, "But your living, your everyday
[42:01] life will testify what you are." What we
[42:05] do here is wonderful. Church services
[42:07] are awesome. I love them. I'm glad you
[42:10] show up for them. Something that I'm
[42:12] called to, my family's called to. So
[42:14] maybe in our lives, this has a lot more
[42:15] preeminence and a lot more weight on us.
[42:17] And we come to church and uh and maybe
[42:19] we interpret things and view things very
[42:21] differently as a family and as a pastor.
[42:23] And then so there's a lot of emphasis
[42:25] that we could put on this and maybe
[42:27] ourselves who show up on a Wednesday
[42:28] night, we're like, man, this is where it
[42:29] at. This is where the real Christians
[42:31] are. But you know what matters is the
[42:33] everyday life because that's what
[42:34] testifies what you are. Anybody can show
[42:37] dedication to a two-hour time slot twice
[42:40] a week.
[42:42] And some people do it on a two-hour time
[42:44] slot every morning of the week. They're
[42:46] dedicated to their altars. They're
[42:48] dedicated to the devotions, their belief
[42:49] systems. He says, "Your living, your
[42:51] everyday life will testify what you are.
[42:53] Your life will bear witness."
[42:56] I was reading a lot in the sermon,
[42:58] leadership this week, and just some of
[43:00] the themes that Brother Bam's pulling
[43:01] from and how that as you even begin your
[43:04] life, something's leading you. I've been
[43:05] thinking about how we influence others
[43:07] and the testimony that we give. And
[43:09] every one of us is called to express
[43:11] God.
[43:13] Paul was called to go to Rome. He was
[43:15] called to stand in these places, even
[43:17] here in Athens on Mars Hill, and to
[43:20] preach a sermon that we could never
[43:21] preach. To say it in ways that Peter
[43:24] could never say it. To say it in ways
[43:25] that those other Jewish disciples could
[43:27] have never been able to phrase it that
[43:29] way. They would have been perceived as
[43:30] an outsider and somebody who's just
[43:32] pretending, opposer, pretender.
[43:37] the sermon leadership. He says, I just
[43:40] I'm this is my last this is my last uh
[43:45] last thing I'm going to read just so you
[43:46] can believe me.
[43:50] The rest will just be on pure
[43:51] inspiration.
[43:54] I'm I'm closing with this unless
[43:56] somebody wants to put this together.
[43:58] Jack, if I need to, I might need those
[43:59] notes back because if I I may be making
[44:01] a huge mistake here.
[44:04] He says in the sermon, "Leadership, I
[44:05] know that's stern, a cutting message,
[44:08] brother. Listen to this. But I didn't
[44:10] come here and choose a message to the
[44:12] people to just try to make them sing,
[44:13] shout, and holler."
[44:16] I've been in heathen meetings where
[44:17] they've done the same thing. I'm
[44:19] interested in your life.
[44:22] Do you realize just what for a lot of
[44:25] people in Leodysia, for a lot of stoics
[44:27] and Epicurans and and skeptics, if they
[44:30] showed up at our church services or
[44:32] special meetings and like what kind of
[44:34] party is this? You know what? What are
[44:36] they vaping? What are they smoking? What
[44:38] are they ingesting? How did I miss the
[44:40] acid tablets when I got in here? These
[44:42] people are acting crazy.
[44:45] But he says, I didn't come here to
[44:46] preach a message to try to make them
[44:47] sing, shout, and holler. I've been in
[44:49] heathens where they did the same thing.
[44:50] I'm interested in your life. This is
[44:52] what we ought to be interested in.
[44:54] I'm a servant of God that's got an
[44:56] answer to God someday. And the ministry
[44:57] that God Lord has given me has
[44:59] vindicated itself thousands of times
[45:01] before you. I believe this is in some
[45:04] way. This is the prophet too. In the
[45:06] same way that Paul stood there before
[45:07] the Gentiles at the initiation of the
[45:09] church. Here's a prophet at the end of
[45:11] this gentile
[45:12] uh dispensation. Remember Jesus said,
[45:14] "Follow me. Follow me. Get rid of what
[45:16] you got and follow me." So
[45:18] what Paul was asking those Epicurans and
[45:20] Stoics and skeptics, those strangers in
[45:23] Athenia and the Athenians themselves,
[45:26] follow me. And that's the only way to
[45:28] have eternal life. That's the only
[45:30] remedy he gave this man was the only
[45:32] remedy he gives the businessman. It's
[45:34] the only remedy that he gives anybody.
[45:36] His choice, he makes his decision. It's
[45:39] perfect every time.
[45:41] Musicians, come to your instruments if
[45:43] you would. He says, "And we must follow
[45:44] him. It's the only way to have eternal
[45:47] life. So the leadership of God is follow
[45:51] the vindicated word of the hour by the
[45:54] Holy Ghost.
[45:56] This is him taking interest in your
[45:57] life, not in your singing, shouting and
[46:01] hollering. You can take an interest in
[46:03] that.
[46:04] But the word, the leadership of God is
[46:07] the leadership of God is follow the
[46:09] vindicated. The word vindicated word of
[46:12] the hour by the Holy Ghost.
[46:17] There's a lot we can learn about how
[46:18] Paul used the poets
[46:22] to get their attention. Say, "Lord, use
[46:23] me.
[46:25] Use me." This is part of just the
[46:26] inspiration even that I have to even
[46:28] look into a subject of art, bring
[46:30] certain things out because we want this
[46:32] gospel to reach the lost, those that are
[46:36] hungry, those that are thirsting.
[46:38] And it may not be on a whole the masses
[46:42] saying, "Oh, that's awesome. That's
[46:43] wonderful." They may very well mock and
[46:46] deride and call it babbling. Paul comes
[46:48] later to the Corinthians says, "Man, to
[46:49] the Greeks, foolishness."
[46:53] having this experience himself. This
[46:56] gospel to the Greeks is foolishness. But
[46:58] there was a demaris there that day.
[47:00] There was a judge there that day and
[47:02] they said even that judge that one was
[47:04] uh made an elder and a bishop in the
[47:06] church there in Athens. It's a great
[47:08] rich history in the history of the
[47:10] church and there were others that heard
[47:13] and believed. It's not going to be just
[47:16] one great big upswell revival where in
[47:18] thousands come, but there's enough to be
[47:20] gleaned in our own families, in our own
[47:22] homes, in our own lives, the fruits of
[47:24] the spirit to be made manifest. Lord,
[47:27] help us to be impacted by the gospel and
[47:30] may the gospel use us for God's glory.
[47:32] If we could stand to our feet. Thank you
[47:35] for your attention tonight.
[47:38] [Music]
[47:42] I accidentally tore up Sunday's notes.
[47:44] So, I have to start all No, those are
[47:49] God help us. Such a wonderful atmosphere
[47:52] here. I think our church has such a has
[47:54] been woven together in a very precious
[47:56] way. God's doing great things amongst
[47:59] us. Don't be discouraged.
[48:02] God is moving.
[48:04] If you don't feel it in your own life,
[48:05] believe for it.
[48:07] There are certain markers we look for
[48:09] and whether I'm looking for this to
[48:10] believe God's moving and I want to feel
[48:11] this to believe God's moving. Just look
[48:12] to his word. Follow the vindicated word
[48:15] of the hour by the Holy Spirit. Call
[48:17] upon God for revelation. Dig down deep.
[48:19] Get in the spirit of the revelation of
[48:21] the word of God. And don't be so
[48:23] distracted by some sort of historical
[48:26] uh microcosm or some emblem of what the
[48:30] message is supposed to represent and be.
[48:32] Know Christ personally.
[48:34] Know him. Let him lead you. Let him
[48:36] guide you. Be confident that there is a
[48:38] known God
[48:40] that can make himself known to others
[48:42] and to you. And so, let's not use the
[48:44] metrics of the world to determine
[48:46] whether or not God's moving. There's a
[48:48] lot of pains. There's a lot of pressing.
[48:49] There's a lot of things that come in
[48:50] upon us, whether it be financial or
[48:52] emotional, and a lot of different
[48:53] things. And we use these certain markers
[48:55] of bank account, economics, and and we
[48:57] get so caught up in that that were no
[48:59] different than the philosophers of days
[49:01] gone by. What made Paul different is his
[49:04] Jewish philosophy had been upturned by a
[49:06] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[49:08] And I believe that we can know him in a
[49:10] personal way. Let's pray. Gracious
[49:12] heavenly father, Lord, I pray for these
[49:14] people tonight that stand before me
[49:17] that are so desirous of you that they
[49:22] faithfully Lord, I'm looking out upon a
[49:23] congregation that Wednesday after
[49:26] Wednesday after Wednesday they're here.
[49:29] You can pretty much count on it. The
[49:32] doors are open. They'll be here. And
[49:34] Lord, I do not believe they come to a
[49:37] Mars Hill to have their ears tickled or
[49:39] to hear about strange gods. But Lord,
[49:41] they come because they want to know you
[49:42] more. They need something to meet them
[49:46] in the journey that they're in to
[49:47] sustain them.
[49:50] a message, Lord, that'll be preached,
[49:51] that'll wash away their fears, that'll
[49:53] heal heal their sick parts,
[49:57] that'll open up the path before them so
[49:59] they can know what to do on a Thursday
[50:01] morning.
[50:02] Lord, I want to say that I'm interested
[50:06] in their life.
[50:08] That as a church, we're interested in
[50:10] their life. We're not just trying to
[50:11] come up with a form where we can say
[50:13] amen. We can hoop and holler, sing,
[50:15] shout, or just observe church order
[50:17] perfectly. But we've we gather because
[50:19] we're interested in others lives. And
[50:23] Lord, I pray that your your love would
[50:24] just be poured out upon them. That
[50:27] tonight as each one would leave, they
[50:29] would just feel a little bit lighter in
[50:30] their spirits,
[50:32] knowing that you are alive and well,
[50:35] that we are your children. And that in
[50:38] you, we have our full reality, that you
[50:41] are real to us. And having become real
[50:44] to us, Lord, give us a language where we
[50:46] can relate to others and we can become
[50:48] relatable to others so that we could
[50:49] bring a relevant gospel to them who sit
[50:52] on their own Mars Hill worshiping an
[50:54] unknown god, citing poems and hymns of
[50:58] of songwriters and playwrights and
[51:00] philosophers in modern times, but yet
[51:03] don't know you.
[51:05] And may we be able to proclaim a gospel
[51:07] of a Christ who's alive and well and a
[51:10] time of judgment that is coming. We're
[51:12] at the time of ignorance. It's over. The
[51:15] time has come. The delay is over. Now,
[51:18] now we must seek your face. Now we must
[51:21] follow on to know the Lord.
[51:24] May we become
[51:27] ourselves your own poetry, your own
[51:30] hymn, your own mystery made flesh.
[51:35] Lord, what an interesting
[51:38] place to sit.
[51:40] The disciples walked with Christ,
[51:44] handled him, saw him,
[51:47] were there in that upper room when the
[51:49] Holy Spirit was poured out.
[51:52] But now these Greeks are going to be
[51:53] told about that.
[51:56] They're not going to witness a
[51:57] crucifixion and a subsequent pouring out
[51:59] of your spirit, but they're going to be
[52:00] told that it happened.
[52:03] And with these babblers, so-called, the
[52:05] foolishness so-called,
[52:08] and the mockery and the laughter, there
[52:10] was those that heard it and believed,
[52:14] clung to Paul, recognizing
[52:17] life eternal.
[52:20] Lord, if there's any here who don't know
[52:22] you in that way, may they seek your
[52:23] face. May you not be an unknown god to
[52:26] them. May they not hide behind
[52:28] philosophy and isms, but may they seek
[52:30] your face.
[52:32] And Lord, I want to be a light. I want
[52:33] to be a voice, not to preach a sermon,
[52:35] but to live a life
[52:37] that'll bear witness of this great
[52:39] gospel. We commit the people to you now
[52:42] tonight. Asking that you bless those
[52:43] that'll be traveling soon. The coffee
[52:45] family going to a family camp in Idaho.
[52:47] Others in their family vacations.
[52:50] Some in deep struggles, Lord. Great
[52:52] darkness. There's powers that are trying
[52:54] to divide families and cause divorce and
[52:57] sickness and disease. Oh God, we
[52:59] withstand it.
[53:01] We know you're able. You're more
[53:03] powerful than any force that is upon
[53:05] this earth. Lord, we claim your blood.
[53:08] We apply the token. We stand together
[53:10] with those even those who might have
[53:12] disbelieved or blasphemed. Lord, we say,
[53:14] "Oh Lord, just once more.
[53:17] Don't judge it yet.
[53:19] Be graceful, Lord. Be come to their aid,
[53:22] their defense. Fight their battle, Lord.
[53:24] Be merciful, I pray. Lord, we just speak
[53:28] this under inspiration without any
[53:29] knowledge of forethought. Lord,
[53:31] believing that you're mindful. May you
[53:33] have grace upon us. I pray. We ask this
[53:35] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[53:38] Amen.
