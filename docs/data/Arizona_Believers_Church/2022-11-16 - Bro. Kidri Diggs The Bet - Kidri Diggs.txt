TRANSCRIPT
========================================
by the grace of God tonight I want to encourage encourage you Amen to look at life as a Christian a little bit different you know that that uh you know there's a song We Sing he's the god of the hills in the valleys amen but you know a lot of times when we're in the valley you know those are the times when we don't feel like we're Christians those are sometimes those are the times we don't even feel like God is on our side and my subject tonight I I just want to use it you know in a in a in a plain context and I want to title this tonight the bet the BET amen you know right now we're we're in a in a in a season of sports and football and baseball and all these things and their bets going all over the place you know what everybody's betting on their team man and and most most most likely if you place down a bet you're putting that bet on who you think the winner is in church uh what I want us to look at right here in the Book of Job that this whole thing job with you was simply a bet between God and the devil the greatest trial of his life was just God telling the devil okay I bet you oh my God church but what I want us to understand is that God doesn't change and God is not afraid to put you to the Forefront because he's confident in the seed he placed inside of you he's confident in what you're going to turn out to be so what God will do God will allow you to be tested God will allow you to go through things that there's no explanation for just to prove to the devil that you will stand [Music] Hallelujah at church most of the time when we're going through stuff we're looking for explanations we're crying I don't know about you guys but I do Hallelujah I get down on my knees I cry to God sometimes I fast and pray and I'll be like Lord what's going on and God stays silent Hallelujah sometimes he answers most of the time he answered but Church there's been times in my life where God don't give me nothing I just have to keep pressing holy I just have to keep serving them and not only pressing and serving but with a good attitude because we know what a bad attitude can do a bad attitude can take a five days journey and turn it into 40 years oh my that's what that's what a bad attitude did for the children of Israel God gave him a promise of a land that was flown with milk and honey now he said go possess it he was saying that the land is already yours what hindered up that possession of the land what hindered the people it was their attitudes they Mama they complaining we had food and we had drink and everything was all right did they realize they were slaves Oh my he blows me away people mommy complain about the church and the message too strict and all these things who are you without this message no more than a slave to sin no more than a slave in the devil's camp but God came Hallelujah to set us free oh my God oh I can see what kind of service it's gonna be let me get my watch set hallelujah praise the Lord bear with me for a second Hallelujah but God is so rich in Mercy you know he'll even God will even show up when our attitudes are not right the children of Israel moment and complaining and they say oh we had melons and we had good old uh fruit and avocado and we can make guacamole and all this stuff in Egypt and God hallelujah and God and His gracefulness God hallelujah brought down Manna From Heaven Hallelujah Church understand this God gave them food Hallelujah that nobody had ever tasted before and that's what he's done for us he's given us food Hallelujah other Generations other Church ages have never tasted before Hallelujah Baptists have never tasted this food we're eating upon holy methodists and Pentecostals they never tasted this food that we're eating upon and people are still complaining [Music] and you know but one thing about God will never make himself look like he's not able to do something Hallelujah so you complain you complain God knows how to shut our mouth and Time After Time God came to set the children of Israel's mouth they complained about the fool God brought food they complained about uh the the the the the manner they say our soul loafed this light bread such ungrateful people then God brings down Hallelujah fresh cooked Quail meat God got others in heaven Hallelujah Supernatural Grill hunt you to my rotisserie this was a season that they never tasted before my church but you look in the midst of all the adversity God remains faithful and I believe just in my own my own uh trials and tribulation God just wants me to go through things with a smile on my face on that one some people just want to be mad for no reason look man come to church look look at the song leader why he's bursting just mad don't you realize we're singing unto God we'll sing it until the most high Hallelujah and we can't get nothing out of you oh my oh my let me leave that alone let me leave that alone but church as we look right here in the Book of Job that's some key elements in here I want us to grasp no no no now the Bible says that the children uh the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and the Bible says the devil came also holy I want you to understand the only thing that can hinder the move of God in the service is somebody receiving a thought of unbelief in their mind that's the only thing that can hinder the supernatural in your life tonight is the way you think Hallelujah because before it manifests as a spirit you have to receive it first as a thought Hallelujah yeah we say the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind yes that is true but realize it is a battle Hallelujah it doesn't automatically belong I said praise God it ain't good to see hey man we're going way back Hallelujah she's trying to keep me healthy when I come to Canada amen but praise God Church y'all forgive me amen it's good to see people amen but Church praise God God wants us to go through things and appreciate his grace Hallelujah but a lot of times we go through things and we're like Lord why me Lord why is this I said I preached a message years ago why not me why not now Hallelujah because our goal is to be perfected by God but church when we look right here in the scripture the Bible says that the sons of God with the church and the devil came also but what I want you to understand is that God always sees the devil in the midst of his people Hallelujah he never catches God by surprise amen wherever he shows himself God knows where his footsteps will go before he does I know that's hard for you to believe but let's make something real clear God created the devil hallelujah it's like oh my I'm about to say something gonna shake your boots his life does not belong to him oh my God Satan is a tool in God's hand and what is that tool doing that tool is perfecting the bride of Christ [Applause] amen God created his own arch enemy he says you know what Lucifer Dragon Satan you I want you to bring the best out of me so the devil has a purpose and his purpose is to make God look great and dumb devil don't even realize it he don't even realize the church but look right here amen I want to show you Church things you go through is not a coincidence it's not a mistake it's not a perhaps they're ordained before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and church look here uh God says unto the devil Satan whisk comes down basically what are you doing here and Satan says you know I'm walking to and fro up and down the Earth trying to mess up somebody's life and look at look at God's position God is going to order the devil's footsteps now God says unto the devil have you considered my servant job uh oh the bed is on the table but Satan says of course I have I've been wanting him for a long time but you know what you're protecting him you got a hedge around them I can't get nowhere near him I can't get to his possessions I can't get to his family I can't mess up his job I can't do nothing even his car running right cause you got a hedge around them church I want you to know that that's just not for job that's for everybody in this room Hallelujah God always protects his children and Satan can't do nothing in your life except God gives him what permission Satan has to sign a permission slip before he take any of us on any kind of trip in our life he has to get a permission slip from God oh my that you know what that makes me want to shout hallelujah because it lets me know that whatever I'm going through God has already signed off on and if God has signed off on it there's other scripture that comes into play are you with me Andrew there's other scripture that comes into play if God signs up on it he's basically saying everything has to work out for his good whoa Hallelujah but you know what we do we look at what we go oh Lord why me why I'm going through this why don't you want to be perfected churching now Satan responds back to responds back to God and he says hey I've been wanting them for a while y'all know I'm paraphrasing he says I've been wanting them for a while he said but you protecting them you got a hands around them I can't get close to him he said but Satan said but I guarantee he says you think he's serving you for nothing you think he's serving you just to be serving you he's serving you because you protecting him and you blessing them in everything he does God said okay that's what you think he said well let's get something clear let's get something clear Joe my servant well I want you to understand about him see before he let the devil have him God had a testimony about job God began to testify over job's life he says oh Amen in uh in in verse 8 he said verse one and eight if you can't bro John put that up real quick I want the people to see what how God testifies over his children's life he says and the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in all the Earth what if God is saying that about you Church before you go through anything before any dices rolled before any Hammer is come down before any card is ever dealt God has told the devil Hallelujah that there is none like him or her in the Earth but he didn't stop there God put adjectives to job's life he said he's perfect oh before he even went through the trial God said listen to the devil this one you want he's perfect oh my you know what and I've been I begin to look up these words these adjectives God was using that word perfect holy that word perfect it means complete look at what God said about job before he even went through the battle he's telling the devil he's perfect he's saying he's giving Satan subliminal messages and he can't even catch it Satan is Satan is in God's Walmart and the music is trying to hypnotize him but he ain't even catching it y'all know I want my dude you go in there to buy three things and come out with a full buggy everywhere you turn you see one of them big smiley faces enticing you to buy more but look at the subliminal messages God has given he said he said a perfect That Word Perfect means complete he didn't stop there one who lacks nothing in physical strength Beauty Etc Hallelujah sound wholesome listen what God is saying about Job look at God's testimony over the one who's about to be tried he's telling the devil you go ahead but he won't fall because he's complete he's sound he's wholesome he's lacking nothing oh Devil's so smart too he don't God is testifying over his life hallelujah amen wouldn't you go into bed believe in that oh yeah I put all my money on Jehovah complete me complete means he is over hallelujah hallelujah Amen in ordinary quiet sort of person complete morally innocent Hallelujah having Integrity one who was morally and ethically pure that's what this word perfect means God has really pouring it on thinking I don't know if I was joking I would have been reading that smile I'd be like God that what you think about me I've been blushing all over the place Brothers you think about if you talk to your husband like you talk to your wife like that she can't do nothing but help smile bring you know amen Brothers God damn come on Brothers do better oh my but then God didn't stop he said he's perfect and upright that word upright means correct oh my right straight level Hallelujah please and correct straight forward amen just listen what God is saying about job before he even go through the trial now as we go through this trial job gonna be like oh my you know uh why am I even born I wish I would die when this is how God looks at him God looks at him as perfect in the upright and we go through trials and we're like oh God why me what did I do oh my God didn't see what job saw amen oh my church but then he says unto the devil nevertheless the Lord said verse 12 he says and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy hands only upon himself put forth not thy hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and y'all know Satan probably was skipping to My Lou he probably was like oh boy I got him oh oh boy I've been a mess I've been a stripping law he probably think I've been a struggle I'm gonna take everything and God's sitting back laughing he like dummy didn't I tell you he was perfect and upright see Satan don't be catching it church I want you to understand something you are bride you are the apple of God's eye and there's nothing that you can go through Hallelujah that will take you away from God if you're God's child all they can do is make you stronger Hallelujah and I hope in this climate that most of us are getting stronger I don't know about you but I go through trials I have no explanation for but it's the goodness of God I've learned to smile about it now Hallelujah but church as we see look at what he was doing let's think about what the prophet of God says the prophet of God when he looked at this this is what he said about the whole situation he said oh my he said job was was taking his children through every the only providing approach that was the burnt offerings and now here's a little thing I want you to notice after all the turmoil and everything was over and then God had taken all his sheep and all his cattle and all the horses he said God had taken not the devil God allowed this to happen Oh my he said and then at the end of his chastisement um why does God what what does chastisement show when it comes to God it shows his love the Bible says whom God loves he rebuking what Jason oh my you feel like you're being whipped tonight maybe it's the love of God amen maybe you didn't even do anything wrong God's just showing you how much he love you oh my indeed he says at the end of the Test match all purging God doubled to him amen after he went through what the key word purging amen he says even when you're bringing for a fruit I'll Purge you that you bring forth more fruit oh praise God he says now this is the thing I want us to catch this is this is this is just this next part I'm about to read it's kind of the meat of my thought tonight listen he says now if you ever notice how that wind the disaster struck job's house anybody ever been in a disaster about three of you I say every summer in Arizona is a disaster boy you can get up to 128 out here sisters can but you go ahead like it I love it but listen disaster is not always Hallelujah the end of something a lot of times when you look through the courses of God and how God does things he uses disaster Hallelujah to bring forth New Life amen remember the story of Ruth her husband dies her father-in-law dies her brother-in-law dies oh what a disaster he was such a disaster but it took that disaster to get her down the Boaz [Applause] amen it took all that tragedy it took the disaster losing family members and not knowing what's next to be led on the right path to get down to her kidsman Redeemer Hallelujah so she could marry Hallelujah Boaz and then amen everything from there can be begin to come forward out of her amen being born Hallelujah through an illegitimate Hallelujah bloodline it looked like it was such a disaster but God was going to use all of that to make the Lord Jesus Christ come out of that lineage oh my God can use a disaster then come to them Hallelujah Jesse and Jesse oh bad Hallelujah did Jesus Christ comes through it oh my God you look at the disasters in the scripture Rahab Hallelujah her life was such a disaster oh my at a young age the prophet of God said she was forced into that life to take care of her sick parents now why are you living the way you living I hope I hope there's a real purpose behind it amen but her she did she she was she was doing what she had to do in that moment earlier but then in her heart see that's the thing you got to realize Satan doesn't know what's in your heart that's why he studies your life Hallelujah that's why Google as soon as you talk about something it'll pick it up and Flash it on your computer it'll pick it up and Flash it on your phone they make me sick with that I cut off every track and every every everything on my phone it don't mean that because they still gonna track you so you got to be okay with it you got to be not having secrets Hallelujah because your secrets will find you out but then church when you think about it amen you think about this hardly This Disaster this disastrous life Rahab was living Hallelujah but one day the desire in her heart came right in front of her face Hallelujah in the form of some spies Hallelujah coming down to take over the land Rahab got inspired and she said you know what hey look at here I take this bet y'all come on in my house y'all come on in my house I'll protect y'all y'all come on in here I'll take this bet hallelujah amen and she didn't know them from Adam she didn't know them for anybody but she bet her whole life that these men were men of God Hallelujah I hope you're betting hallelujah oh Jesus Christ tonight churches she said amen so they talking they did all the stuff Rahab said hey I want you guys to give me a token what does a prostitute know about a token see adversity begins to bring out the real you same thing with the woman at the well she's talking to Jesus and the more Jesus talked the more Revelation came out of her when everybody else thought she was just a prostitute oh my but George as we can see listen man he said when disaster struck Jones house and the children was all killed and and everything and John and all job had was destroyed God wasn't rebuking job he was only purging job and then the prophet of God says amen he wasn't rebuking job he was only purging job oh my he was only purging job amen I like that word Purge and then he goes on to say he says the branch that bears fruit then God purges it that it will bring forth more fruit okay well let's look at that there's nothing wrong with the with the with the life of the tree God just want more fruit holy so what does he do he purges it amen and the scripture says if we're not bringing for fruit Hallelujah he cut it away amen but even when you're bringing for fruit even when you're praying even when you're playing you're paying your tithes you're coming to church faithful you got to pray a life God's saying I'm gonna Purge you that you breathe for more fruit [Applause] oh he was like oh God what did I do nothing he doesn't want more from you because he knows there's more fruit in that tree and then the scripture says you shall know them by what their fruit so until we get out of here you're going to have to produce fruit and for those of you who are just laid back saying I'm in the message I mean I'm out here where the Prophet this was the last place he was I in Arizona praise God no God want more than that there's more fruit to be given of God and when you speak of fruit you speak of life Hallelujah God wants more substance out of all of us he said but look how's he going to get it he said he'll Purge you when you purging something that means that there's things down in it that's no good oh oh boy we into it now please don't turn the Bloodhound loose up in here tonight but church he says even when you say he was a rebuking job he was only purging job and you know Hallelujah a tree can live Hallelujah but it has to come to a point where that tree has to be pruned there's nothing wrong with the life of the tree it's just certain situations have happened within the growth of that tree to where that tree certain Bridges have gotten stagnated or maybe there's a branch that's blocking other branches from getting sunlight so now Hallelujah something has to be cut off and you know Hallelujah normally when the tree holy has to be purged it has to be somebody that comes in and knows how to prune I want to show you a video about pruning let's go bro John praise God now it's the thing about pruning soon it's called a three-step message you don't just go ahead and start cutting the tree in the wrong way there's some steps to it keep going [Music] just the wrong way if you make a single cut from the top of the branch Watch What Happens okay stop stop it most of us we think with things gone in a church or things happen in our life let's go right to the source why don't the passengers pre-sold it and cut it all out I know he know what's going on why he just won't stop it no that's a correct method Hallelujah you can't all the time just go straight to it in a congregation and wipe it out now that's the way I love to do it and that's why I'm not a pastor Hallelujah but you know what church Hallelujah there's a correct method the thing about this method is if you go straight to the Hallelujah the branch where the branch is splitting in in the weight of the tree if you cut it right there the weight of that bridge is going to rip the tree keep going stop [Music] now the weight of that Branch being cut right there actually wounds the tree and those are those reasons why when you see things happen in the church the pastor take his time and we'd be like oh my God Pastor please just come on rebuke him oh you know it ain't nothing but the devil rebuke him straight we all can see it rebuke them he's a shepherd see his whole job is to take care of the sickness without killing the tree me on the other end I'd be like well I just do all that let's just chop the whole tree down chop it down get one of those salt eating things and push all all of them be sawdust by the time I'm finished you wouldn't even know a tree was there again that's why I'm not a pastor Hallelujah let's go very difficult for this tree to heal properly okay stop he said that way of cutting the tree makes it very difficult to heal you just hold that religion let's understand the purpose of pruning pruning what is it for pruning can remove any portion that have a disease or fungi or other types of Decay stopping it from spreading Hallelujah till healthier branches so that's why you prune a tree that's why you prune a church because these can happen in the church that it'll cause the spread that's why the pastor come on a five-fold Ministry of come and hit things directly in your life trying to clean you up and get you healthy but what we do normally when your clothes are getting stepped on you're like I wonder who that's for eign I hear it but I want to do that for Toad's getting all stepped on but pruning is there so that the tree can continue to live but the way to get it healthy is to cut on it Hallelujah but there has to be it has to be done in the correct manner earlier rebukes and chastisements can't always come from the Deacons you know how you do get upset first thing you do you turn into a snitch y'all know what a snitch is right go run further run to the D man sit there was so her kids be the nurse should be doing this doing that they be messing with everything oh snitch what about what your kids be doing they probably be locking the Stalls in the bathroom then call up under and leave the door lock oh my let's go right way to prune a tree is called the three cut methods simple as one two three three is what one about a foot away okay trunk I'll make an undercut on the bottom of the limb okay stop right there only go about a third the first cut is not a cut on top it's the cut underneath and usually when the word comes and and he's dealing with people's hearts and things like that it's cause that nobody else can see there are things that God will address in your life that nobody else knows about there's things that the pastor will come and preach on that nobody else knows about you're going through why because he's trying to get the tree healthy amen everything doesn't have to be done in front of everybody that's why we thank God for a Divine interpretation through a Vindicated Prophet Hallelujah when we would not Hallelujah denomination take scriptures where people come and say confess your faults before everybody what good is it gonna do you if I come up and tell the whole church oh man I got a problem with eating too much chocolate cake they ain't gonna help you none that's just gonna make you know not to invite me when you cook chocolate cake see sometimes we look for things to happen and it's not the right way it's supposed to be done in secret Hallelujah and God deals with hearts in secret however you may see somebody look like they struggling look like they're doing things wrong but God is cutting it secretly holy God is dealing with that heart secretly I know a sister in Canada Hallelujah see I came out of denomination she started going to a message church and she loved it Hallelujah which which she didn't know uh uh the precepts of Holiness and all these things so she came with what she got on and everything was tight I mean skin tight you know type but she was coming and enjoying the word and one day his brother got a brother got uh anointed he went up to the sister he told he said hey look here I can't I can't get none of the word because your clothes are too tight black huh that affected her so much did she quit Church went back to her denomination but while she was in the denomination she just realized it wasn't the same see God had made a contact Hallelujah God was dealing with a heart Hallelujah inside out but this brother Hallelujah who rebuked her she wasn't the problem it wasn't her clothes or clothes wasn't the problem the problem was he had a lost demon on him so the next time you think about rebuking Somebody by how they dress make sure it ain't you the problem Hallelujah did that be the first thing Steph righteous people do they see somebody else Falls and they just want to blast it I'm spiritual I got the Holy Ghost you know them kind of people always talking about I got the Holy Ghost I got perfect love normally they don't have it because when you got something you ain't got to tell everybody about it how many times don't we believe that the prophet was operating in perfect faith and in perfect love how many times you hear him preach I got it oh my how many times you heard Jesus say I got it no it just was demonstrated Hallelujah and you know this sister she she left and she came back and you know the pastor wondered what happened so she came into office and started confessing to the Past she said look Pastor you know this is all I got I just come to church with whatever I got you know I ain't got much money she said I love the word here but brother so-and-so say I'm a distraction and the Pastor said he did what and I thank God for pastors like this amen he went and got that brother he laid into him so good I mean laid into him like he was a a linebacker chasing a quarterback I mean he laid into him real good and told him don't you ever mess with somebody in this church again when they trying to serve God with all with the best of their heart with the right intentions and then the pastor Hallelujah gave his wife some money and told us hey you're going to take the sister shopping and that's the last time they ever had to deal with that Hallelujah and now she's Hallelujah redeemed of the Lord serving God Married with Children in this message and living her life the bus cover it could just be God pruning the tree Hallelujah sometimes God has showed me amen I remember amen as my daughter uh began to court my son-in-law and I didn't know anything about him I was gonna act the fool not finto I was oh my son-in-law told me years later he said look I always wanted to meet you he said but your daughter wouldn't let me I was like jazz why not she say Daddy cause you was acting crazy and my craziness was I know what this message is what it's supposed to produce and this young man ain't it and I ain't standing for it we don't know who bride is Hallelujah and the greatest the greatest thing God taught me when you dedicate your child to the Lord the rest of it belongs to God Hallelujah normally we mess things up as parents cause we get in the way so what God did my daughter's about 20 20 about 20 then guard gamer started talking to me he said look here and I'm and I'm giving I'm giving some of you food for thought Hallelujah because some of us message Believers We've ran our children away because of our standards in the message much of nonsense your standard is your life not your law Hallelujah look and you know God begins to come to me he says look here look here let me tell you something he said there was only one John the Baptist and it wasn't you because you know when you get saved you see everything that's wrong nobody can match up nobody's good enough for your daughter another means she would have never got married she'll still be single but then church God comes to me he says look here let me tell you something he said she's above age she don't need your permission she can go get married have children and you not be a part of none of it because of your standing now you can say what you want but if you love your children you want to be a part of their life no matter what lifestyle they may have and you know when God told me that he was like you gonna mess up everything he's like look here I'm gonna give you a Ministry Hallelujah a Ministry Hallelujah that can shake the world a new ministry that can shake the world Hallelujah and this ministry is powerful and I was like yes Lord give it to me yes Lord I say Lord I want it please give it to me and God said okay this new ministry I'm giving you is called the shut your mouth Ministry and that's the hardest thing for a daddy to do just shut your mouth and let it play out cause God began to recite to me all the truths she's grown she don't need your permission and she can do whatever she wants and I was like Lord you're right he said now would you rather her do that or you befriend the situation and then you can guide her through it I say the second part Lord I think I want to do the second part so you know what I begin to say okay you know Jazz this and that and everything blah blah you know I I was acting more of a friend than a dad and as I acted as a friend she put me in position as a dad then she started to ask me what do I think about my son-in-law now ask me what I begin to think about then I could give my input and nobody would be hurt Hallelujah and as I begin my input you know different things start to fall in place and they begin to get closer and closer and I shut my mouth and then it got to the place where my son-in-law comes to me Church what I'm saying is I was being purged Hallelujah I was being purged because I didn't want to let go I wanted to force my opinion I'm the head of this house and you gonna do what we gonna stand for this message and God said shut your mouth be quiet and let me take care my son-in-law comes to me he says Hey I want to meet with you let's get together let's talk that's what we got together and we sat in the car we talking he said hey you know what I want to marry your daughter I like man please like man please ain't gonna happen I don't say now how long y'all about three years I said in three years this person you want to spend the rest of your life with he looked me in my face and say yes sir oh like whoa no experience with the message no experience with the prophet any of that he grew up a Baptist so y'all know I got my gun cocked you ain't getting my daughter now you talking and then he said this to me he said look I want to marry her he said but I ain't gonna do nothing unless I got your blessing I was like putting it was all like oh right what was it was God showing me I got it under control so me and him had a talking then I began to tell him what I see and I said he said we always we always hear about wanting the father's blessing he said but we don't even know what it is can you tell me so then I begin to tell him what I expect out of a son-in-law in church holy God is my witness that boy has stepped up to the plate and become everything that I could have wanted for my daughter and it really got me one day Hallelujah after I preached at church he called me and he said hey uh can you do me a favor I say what how can I get a hold of all brother random messages I said I said we got him we got what oh god you're good greatest Ministry shut your mouth Ministry so that was God pruning my tree helping me to take my hands off of it say God say I got it that's what maybe somebody in here need to do tonight you're worried about your children are you worried about certain things just take your hands off of it Jesus the prophet God say the greatest weapon we got Holier is a confession and a communal Hallelujah you confess to God what you want what you expect of him what you need of him Hallelujah and then you commit it to the Lord take your hands off of it and it's over go on serving God believing he's going to take care of it Hallelujah now it may not happen Church look at here hallelujah the only right you got to complain I'm going to tell you I'm gonna tell you when you can complain according to the scripture you can only complain when it's 26 years later I guess that did you because it took Abraham 25. it was after the year 26 and God ain't answered the prayer again whatever then you can complain but if it's 20 years you just got to just be quiet you got to still go to God say Lord help me Father God I know I'm being pruned how do you get the sickness out my tree okay let's go keep going this is the undercut this is the first cut this is the second cut an inch or two further out than the first cup okay stop did you hear what he said he said now that cut was a little bit closer now he's going to go further out Hallelujah and see you think about the church why would God go through all these things Hallelujah to make sure when he deal with the problem it never reoccurs again hallelujah what we will say oh God just chop the whole thing off he said no if I hear you it's going to be Hallelujah until you make it to the other side it ain't gonna be no wrestling with real current Spirits or remissions of cancer and all that remission hey please how many times did Jesus die on the cross cancer don't have a right to come back he dealt with every sickness every disease every attribute of sin once and one time only Hallelujah and it wasn't a a remission of calvary where he had to go back through it all over again no once he did it it was done Hallelujah so that cut right there Hallelujah that cut goes out a little bit further but let's watch it that is made from the top down I'll keep sorry until that Branch breaks free oh it broke free perfect but look you see the undercut Hallelujah stop the whole tree from being damaged it's the thing that happened that nobody else saw stopped the tree from being damaged Hallelujah and it's the things that God do for you in your own private time Hallelujah that strength is your tree amen that makes your tree grow and produce Hallelujah and let it shed light in other areas of your life let's keep going without ripping the back three the last cut the branch removed I can make my final cut the Final Cut you see what he's doing this area of the branch is a little thicker than the rest it's called the branch column it's very important that I don't cut into that so that the tree will heal properly okay stop now he can deal with the total branch but it's being cut in a way to when he's finished dealing with that whole Branch pulling that whole Branch the whole tree will heal back easily because the steps of it were done according to God's will so when God pruning Hallelujah pruning the tree and doing what he does all he's trying to do amen is show us that we're more than conquerors Hallelujah through Christ that strengthens me amen you can take that down brother John amen but your church when the pruning is complete why does it pruning happens he says amen that when a tree is pruning you have to cut certain things off now that bridge had to be cut why because that Branch Hallelujah was taken from another branch that needed what it had and a lot of times God will bring up things in your life just to clean you off because there's another place he's trying to take you and there are things within us that you don't even know is there until God begins to prune the tree and I'm going to shock you with the Holy Ghost while you're filled with the Holy Ghost he'll go through a pruning everybody the Holy Ghost take care of all that how many believe the prophet has the Holy Ghost you know he also had a lion spirit inside Hallelujah he had to be pruned how did God prune him through his tax situation look he had no explanation why it was happening he did everything right he put the money in the right places he sent it to the right places he put it all back in the church and all these things but he still had a tax debt and the tax people coming after him when he was doing everything right there was no explanation and you know what God wouldn't take it away God let the pressure come and the pressure come and the pressure come what was he doing he was raising up that lie he was raising up that lie he knew that the prophet was going to tell so he let the pressure come and the pressure come and the pressure come to that day and you know the prophet had different phones but the tax collectors had them all me to say oh bill it's that tax collector tell them I'm not in here what was he doing he was pruning our prophet pruning him in such a way till he could self-reflect Hallelujah and now he's self-reflecting Hallelujah and he walks outside and he goes to do what we've always done he's a man filled with the Holy Ghost amen having meetings and healing people and all these things amen you can be pruned Hallelujah and be used of God but look what God did to him he goes to pray and then hey God said get your hands off that child you're not fit to pray for you just told a lie now a real man of God real woman of God when God exposes your sickness your disease and your tree he's trying to prune you you don't point it off on somebody else amen they bother you ain't blame me that he ain't blame nobody he went back went to the very man he lied to he said look when you called the last time he said I was in the house and I'm sorry I lied to y'all know how the story but I'm paraphrasing he said I'm sorry I lied to you he said you know what Mr Brandon I've always had respect for you but now I have even more respect Hallelujah and if you do things right you will call somebody else tree to grow now this lawyer he always had respect for brother Branham Hallelujah but when he came back Hurley and told the truth even when this loyalist tax man didn't even know that he lied when he came back and told him that amen that gave him even more confidence in his ministry sure God will rise it up Hallelujah in church as we see he did the same thing you look at job's life I'm gonna be on this longer y'all know I'm about to close you look at Joe's life as job went through the trial what came out more and more revelation what I love about it from the beginning job goes through it and he's being pruned job doesn't complain job says blessed be the name of the Lord when was the last time something happened to your car something happened in your family and you had no answer for it but you lift your hands and you said blessed be the name of the Lord that's what he wants and I must admit it took me a while to get there but by God's grace now I don't even try to look for new explanation I just say Lord thank you I don't know what you're doing but help me to look at it right and it's so crazy church because the way that I if if you can look into my life for a second let me be transparent you know God Amen this is a walk of faith for me and you know uh uh uh uh I live by the gospel everything is by the gospel and you know the enemy always fights me with my finances I have everything together get things paid off the next thing you know a bill comes out of nowhere I'm like what where did this come from oh I pay my tots like what you know I know and I just don't have no explanation for but what I can't rely on I said God I didn't pay my time that's your problem and then uh God anoint somebody or anoint a situation next thing you know something comes my way in and it's all taken care of and I'm like praise God hallelujah and you know Satan is such a liar and God was showing me this today normally the areas you're fighting in God is showing you that the accusations the devil is bringing against you you're really the opposite of because he can create so what he does is present a lie to you Hallelujah so what God was saying to me today while I was thinking over this amen that he fights me in my finances because he don't want me to really believe that I'm rich whoa hallelujah oh hey Hallelujah Hallelujah now you can believe what you want holy but the opposite of broke is rich and Satan come say you're broke you're broke you broke you're broke and we're like yeah that what you think you ain't gonna get me to get that to come out my mouth like no I'm blessed in the Lord and if I ain't got it God I'll send it to me God will create it if he can create Rams Hallelujah if he can create all these others I'm sure he can create a Benjamin Franklin Hallelujah 10 of them Hallelujah Church before I go forward let's narrow this down real quick everybody all right now we know Hallelujah Satan cannot create amen God is the only creator now I'm going to challenge you so is sin really real if he can't create where it come from because from the acceptance of your mind because sin is only what unbelief Castle's not real [Music] because it's not a creation it's a perversion of your health depression is not real because it's not a creation amen it's a perversion of your joy Hallelujah church that's how we got to look at these things amen doubt is not real it's a perversion of your faith hate is not real it's a perversion of Your Love amen the attributes of sin are not a creation they're only a perversion so they don't exist in a god-feel mind so you guys what the Bible says listen good the Bible says casting down imagination now that but I was strong we're there now I hope you all got your gloves out I'm strong because Satan but he'll come and say all right brother you know the last time you went to the doctor you got this says who church I haven't personally been to the doctor a couple times and told me you got this you got to ask me nope ain't gonna ain't gonna happen Ain't Going Home With It right after covet everybody all right after Kobe we were traveling but we was getting ready to travel and all these things and I had to go take a D.O.T physical because I have a I have a CDL which I had before I became a full-time evangelist I was a truck driver so I got a CL and uh if you don't know what it is a commercial driver license and I'm not driving trucks anymore I'm drove trucks in several years but I don't believe in giving that back God gave to me so they come and they see they you know you get things in the mail it's time to renew your license every time I go down there they try to get me to give up my CDA I'm like nah they say well you got to take a physical I say let's take it and say you got to take this physical to show you can drive now remember remember I'm not driving a commercial vehicle but I'm gonna go take this test because I'm gonna keep my license never know one day I might have to have a bus with a bunch of messy Believers on it and

[Applause] Hallelujah My Confession is the cross Hallelujah My Confession is by his stripes I'm Healed and what does that my confession that Jesus Christ paid it all he says amen he says the prophet of God said when God see you he don't even see your faults and mistakes all he see is the blood and when you confess the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's justification and justification means justify means it's like you've never even done it in the first place Hallelujah so I'm sitting in there and I know it's pre-working I'm gonna go ahead take a text let's do it do whatever you got to do so she comes over and jugged me or whatever and these people trip they just get uh the little machine you know I'm talking about prick your finger and all that stuff prick your fingers goes off and she looks at he looks at it and they trying to whisper again it's negative and they don't want me to hear it's negative it's like well Mr dizzy uh we need more blood that's just the devil trying to make my faith waver now I knew that that test came back negative and they wasn't satisfied your body has to obey your confession Hallelujah and you know Church they took the test or whatever and uh uh United say gonna take more blood and I was headed to Canada you know that was a wish that I was flying out Thursday and they said well call back Saturday and see what the results look like man I ain't thinking about y'all I'm gonna go preach I deal with this when I get back I ain't wasting up my minutes calling y'all so anyway they called me Mr Diggs your results back you need to come get them I'm like okay call me again Mr D's your results back when he's gone like why'd y'all bother me for I'm gonna deal with it when I get back so I finally get back home it's like a Monday or whatever doctor'll be in Tuesday so I say they called me while I was on the way I said I'm on the way I'm coming so I get up there at a doctor they look over everything he says Mr Diggs everything came back negative I was like what what you expect to happen what I had already told you I ain't got it I ain't boasting but I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ I Believe In My Confession Hallelujah and I've seen him do it already so I ain't go back down Hallelujah I've seen him do it already and then the doctor he's he started to tell me about covert and all these different things and that and he said well Mr D how about next time before you go to the doctor whatever don't take no pre-workout whatever tomato tomato potato potato yeah I had to go through all that let me read you something listen this is what the prophet of God said this is powerful oh my he said if he had ten thousand cattle he give him twenty thousand cattle see oh isn't that marvelous God purged job for the purpose to bless him that'll make everybody smile God pershes you allows you to go through Temptations and trials and all these things just for the purpose of blessing so for those of you who drive trucks and you know about the D.O.T physical the physical physical is supposed to go every two years if you're driving so I've come I was coming back and me and the doctor talking he's sounding my purple work supposed to be two years all these things so he feels everything out he said well Mr D we certainly appreciate you you have a good time that was February 2022. of this year February 2022 so two years from now I have to go back and do it again because my paperwork should say February 20 24. that's two years right so I look at my expiration date on my paperwork it didn't say February 2024. it said February 2032. I'll never be able to get tested again to the Rapture comes um what is the little adversity Hallelujah when God already has a blessing on the back end God just wants to go through it and be happy and smiling giving him thanks and giving him praise and not receiving the lies of the devil while you're being purged because he has a blessing in the end of it God has sent you through the purging only for the reason to bless you and at the end of it job was blessed beyond measure as musicians come Church in so many different ways we've seen God do a purging through the scriptures and you may not have an answer for it to the end of it things can arise and you'll be like Lord why am I going through this if we just take uh Joseph went through hatred and envy and jealousy in his own family they sold them into a sold them into slavery all because he was loved of his father all because he had gifts in his life and he loved his brothers he never did anything wrong to him but God was doing all that just to get him in position Hallelujah but one thing about his life Joseph it kept working because he was going through he didn't become a cold starchy stale Christian no he was still interpreting dreams his life was still shining wherever he went he gets in part of his house part of his wife lies on him now he's thrown in jail he meets the butler the baker they forget all about him but all of that was a process because what was God doing God was making like I said the other night God was making him fit to rule Hallelujah so Church days are purging there's a pruning of our trees oh God wanted more fruit now if you examine your life examine where you are are you just a person who's just faithful enough to come to church you think that's all God wants out of you just a good church member if that's the case I don't know about you but I've met denominational people who've made me get on my knees because they have such a humility upon themselves made me feel like I wasn't even a Christian at times I used to work with a guy you know they they go ask him to do stuff and he'd be like okay they go ask me I'll be like I I got Authority [Music] I'm the bride you know all this foolishness and I look at that man Elmo Johnson me and him still friends in this day I look at him and just Elm was a pentacle he just gonna do it no complaining no hugging no nothing he made me I'll be like kill my knees and pray cause all this Revelation I got what good is it it's not showing and that's what God wants God wants the life are you bearing fruit you shall know them by their fruit are you bearing fruit or are you just satisfied with coming to church amen sitting under a good Ministry and I ain't saying go make something happen but what am I saying are you yielded enough to know that God is directing you where he wants you to go what he needs for me amen are you in a place where you're self-reflecting where you're looking at your life as you go through things and you're like okay God and sometimes that's all God wants is a deeper concentration [Music] because there are things that's supposed to be working in the church but it doesn't happen because we're not consecrated enough because we got our own lives we got our own jobs we got our own families and all these other things what about what God [Music] let's think about that church because there's a bet that's going on right now between God and the devil but I want you to understand God's already confident about you are you confident about him because what God began to do with job we begin to show job that God is on his side and the more he went through the more praise Joe gave God Hallelujah all the way to the place that God had to restore him even with his message believing friends criticizing him with no evidence they were judging what they saw they had no evidence and I'll say this in closing if you see somebody going through something that don't mean sins in their life that just mean God want more fruit remember he was not rebuking Joe he was only Persian Joe [Music]
