TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as Paul is saying uh lifting up that more excellent way and he speaks of Charity and he speaks of it in a number of different context in this chapter he speaks of prophecies and knowledge and these different gifts these tongues and says that they're in part uh they'll they'll be done away with and that when that which is perfect is come is the time that that happens then he says when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child I thought as a child and he says when I was a child I did these childish things because uh it was expected of him at that time if you had saw a child act like a child um there's really no correction in that necessarily it's to be expected and often times it's when children don't act like children that they get the most attention it's like wow that was really mature of you or that was beyond your years and Paul says when I was a child I acted as you would expect he says but when I became a man I put away childish things so there's the mark of maturity even a mark of manhood is when you put childish things away and that's why we look at maturity or this aging or this adulthood that Paul's talking about not so much when you come of age by a number turn 18 or 21 or 30 but rather when your life begins to demonstrate a growth and an understanding of things and I think I mentioned it Sunday morning that I was want to refer all the way back and start pull back from some of the things we ministered on the beginning on the one thing desired and how that life is about learning value and making choices ches to pursue those things which are worth pursuing and that would be a mark of maturity is how that one uh spends their time and their resources and it shows that one is learning value and how things work and so we've used this title when the youngans don't grow up and I believe it really speaks specifically to this particular verse when I became a man when I grew up there was things about my childhood that found their place and there's things that I no longer did because I'm in manhood now I'm in adulthood and I'm using this title as I felt the Lord just impressed upon me to to structure it this way the title implies that you could age but not grow up so it suggests the possibility of not growing up we may say it suggests that you can be a fully functioning uh human being and have all the faculties and the physical abilities of any other human but fail to mature or you fail to reach your potential and that might be a really good way of putting it that you have all the resources available to you you have all the training you have all the gifts and all the talents but you never quite reach your potential or another way of saying it is when young ones don't grow up is they don't fulfill their purpose and we always we kind of joke a lot of times maybe not always that you there you know you're still living at home in your mother's basement and we're like we immediately know they don't live in Arizona and that they must live in Ohio or something and and it's like you're a 40-year-old man you live at home in your mother's basement that's always like one of the biggest uh disses I guess you could give some somebody is to suggest that that means you've never fulfilled your purpose no matter how much uh trolling you do online uh you have not succeeded in life you've never fulfilled the purpose of being a a human being is to grow up and contribute and and to be successful in these different ways and that's one way of saying that you didn't grow up it's not that you didn't age because for some of us may be praying and Desiring that we don't grow up physically but that this is about not maturing and we'll find in the message of God in the of the message of the hour in the Bible the word of God that God's will for his children is perfection and we are a three- room house God wants us to be complete in every respect it's We Are The Dwelling Place of God uh it we are a temple of the Holy Ghost he's wanting to build us up into that stature in 1 Thessalonians chap 5: 23 and 24 Paul says in the very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and whole soul and whole body body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it we do what preserve you blameless to keep you holy and perfect in spirit soul and body to be holy means to be perfect to be complete in all respects so your whole Spirit soul and body that means your entire person there's nothing wanting or lacking it's speaking that God desires that there be Health in your body the desires that there' be soundness of mind he desires that your your soul be sealed and this I know we've ministered on that thought before and I think we could say it this way we know that God's promised us a glorified body that we're going to be perfect in the physical sense the soul has been sealed it's perfect in a sinless sense and it's already in an eighth day condition and so I believe that this wholeness that God desires for us that God who called you can also do includes emotional Harmony and spiritual maturity some review from Sunday in Hebrews chapter 6: 1 to3 Chapter 5 really forms the basis for this he's he's telling them you should be the teachers by now but you're having to be taught again and so you're being held back of grade you should have graduated you should be the professors you should be the one teaching I've got a lot I'd like to say to you but you can't bear it and you become as ones that need milk he says you're still babes you're not growing up you're not continuing so he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection that word there is perfector it speaks of Christ the perfect one who is the highest example of faith in Ephesians he said that we may grow up into him which is Christ so there's a maturing a growing up let us go on unto the perfect one not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit the the same one that called you he also will do it we will come to this place if God will allow if God will permit so he says there's a foundation and if there's a foundation there must be a structure there must be something that is built upon that foundation and it is perfection this Perfection is not sinless Perfection where we're able to go an entire day and not do something wrong but rather it speaks this Perfection is a matter of growth it is a it is maturity it's fulfilling purpose so he's closing out this uh writing to the Hebrews in chapter 13 verses 20 and 21 he says now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect that's to to make perfect is to strengthen to complete and it's rooted in that same the same thought of being a made whole is to make one as they ought to be and that's your full potential what God wants for your life if you're 100 going to be 100 be 100 live it hundredfold make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen to make perfect remember that word I think we used on Sunday that artios it speaks of uh a special aptitude for a given use so God has called you for specific purpose when he makes you perfect he suits you and nurtures you and brings you to that place where you can fulfill your purpose that part which God has planned for you that specific use that God has for you in the body of Christ he perfects you to be able to do that some of the scriptures we ended with on Sunday morning is be therefore perfect and be therefore followers of God as dear children it's Ephesians 51 be therefore perfect or be therefore followers of God as dear children it's this imitation of God and to be a son it necessarily implies imitation of the father coming into His Image it necessarily implies growing into what the father is and in this example in a spiritual birth we've got the perfect father uh my sons may not have that in the natural life but they do have it in the spiritual life that to be a follower of God as dear children imitate him so that you can fulfill Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect be therefore complete have perfect integrity and and virtue fully grow and mature as he is perfect as he needs nothing added to be better as he needs nothing added to be what he is let us also grow let us also mature and be perfect our as our Heavenly Father which is in heaven is perfect now if you turn to Romans chapter 8 vers 15 to1 17 and if you'd like to go back and read the whole chapter before Sunday I'd like to dwell in this chapter a little bit more and uh if you if you have your Amen on mute or Airplane Mode you can turn it off and uh I want to ask the question why grow up you say well I'm a son I'm a son why do I need to grow up and and what what's the what would be the purpose in this even maybe besides identifying that it's God's will for us uh why is it God's will what's in his program and now I know I'm jumping right into the middle of a very large thought a beautiful thought a feel Romans chapter 8 is kind of a summary of the entire message uh and God's end time plan for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father so we're no longer in bondage to a Jew they're no longer under the bondage of the law to all we no longer under bondage of sin and the fear of death he says but we've received a spirit of adoption the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and of children then HS HS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and he's using this phrase and if children so the spirit itself bear witness that we are the children of God we have received the spirit of adoption we haven't received the fullness of adoption but the spirit which is able to bring us to this adoption and this rapturing Grace he says then the spirit indwelling us testified that we are children of God and if children so he said if we're children this all applies and we're not just children in the sense that we trust God or that we love God or that we're dependent upon him but we're children in the sense that we are his seed we we have come from him as it says in Acts 17:28 for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring so Paul is using this phrase if children or that we are children to be used of those who are in a relationship that is nurturing to be used of those who are in a relationship wherein your character is being molded by one that has uh oversight over you responsibility to you so we're children of God and in this relationship with God he is nurturing Us in this relationship to God he is molding our character as children we are led by his spirit and being led by his Spirit it it gives us it governs our thoughts and it animates our actions therefore it reflects God right just like sometimes you might see somebody do something in our family so that's just like brother Aaron they do something good that's just like sister Elizabeth in other words they're they're they're demonstrating what you feel they're learning either by nature or by nurture and really both and they're demonstrating something about the family name about their genes and about how they're they're being raised and so the same as children of God the how we think and how we act reflects upon the character of God as children we are dependent upon God as children we are possessed with the love for his word these are things that it means to be a child of God and then he says as children then hirs so since we are children of God he says there's an allotted inheritance that we have a right to and I love how Paul says we're children of God he says then if you're children think about the consequences then you're heirs Hees of God this is what we are then as his children is we have an allotted portion that is going to be granted to us and he just doesn't stop he says join heirs with Jesus Christ this is the firstborn of God this is our elder brother it says in later in the chapter verse 29 for whom he did for know this is Romans 8 he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so we can say there's God's desire that if we are forn and by forn knowledge we're elected to a new birth God just does not want us to be born born again but he's also predestined us for a destiny of being conformed to the image of his perfect son so God who fornew us and elected us to a New Birth has also destined us to be conformed to the image of his son that he Jesus Christ might be the firstborn among many Brethren did you know that Jesus isn't the only begotten Son of God not anymore he was at the time but now he's the firstborn born among many Brethren he is the he is now the elder brother our divine elder brother and this thought this concept of the firstborn is a very important principle so we realize that Christ is the elder brother he is the firstborn and then we God is saying we are join HS together with Christ that we are not grandchildren to God when I was in Michigan I didn't get a vacation I'm feeling the effects of it I think but I preached a couple services there on a Wednesday and a Sunday while everyone else was vacationing and I ministered God is not a grandpa and I had to make it very clear that that wasn't my time to take shots at brother John my father-in-law uh but it was just using a thought that God cannot be a grandpa God doesn't want to be a grandpa because God only has sons and daughters so our relationship to God is that as a son and a daughter in the same way that Jesus Christ then is saying I'm a son and he prayed that we would be one as he is one with the father and that's the the beauty of this work of Grace and this being translated into the body of Christ is that we are now joint HS with Christ in Hebrews chap 1: 1-4 it says this about Jesus Christ this is the image of God's son God who at sunry times and in diverse manners spake in time past un the fathers by the prophets God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things things so Christ is the heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who be in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they Jesus Christ is the heir of all things he hath purged our sins by himself this is something he did as a son and being obedient and hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they this is what Christ is heir of all things he's obtained an inheritance he was uh the Son of God sent into the world to perform a specific purpose of God and as God's children were also promised an inheritance jointly with Christ Christ is the heir of all things Paul says if children then HS heir of God like he says your heirs like well what am I going to inherit you're an heir of God and join HS with Christ you're not usurping Christ but now it's an inheritance that we share with Christ as Revelations 217 he that 217 says he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son he that overcometh shall inherit all things Christ hath been appointed to be heir of all things there's this there's so much more that could be be expressed in this what I'm trying to show is that as being children of God we're going to be heirs we stand to receive an allotment and as Christ obtained an inheritance he he purged our sins and he by inheritance obtained the more excellent Name than the Angels there is a an inheritance also for us in Christ he's been appointed heir of all things now he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son Jesus gives a parable in Matthew 25 uh of the different servants who are faithful Unfaithful the diff levels of faithfulness and he concludes this in verse 21 his lord said un him well done thou good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord this has great meaning for faithful Believers that you have a role you have a function you have something that you're doing for the kingdom of God in this life and because of our faithful in this life you are made a ruler over more he that is faithful in the least will be faithful in much and so that principle that Christ elicits in those Parables is this making one a ruler they're inheriting something because of their faithfulness in Revelations 3: 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and and set down with my father in in his throne amen quite a statement the Bible says that he has been made much better than the angels having sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high but now there is a promise that to him that overcometh I will grant to him to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne notice that that beautiful symmetry how a son comes into the world and then he sits at the right hand of the majesty and now he gives us this picture to where he is now set in his to sit in his throne as he had sat in the father's Throne how he ALS he overcame and was sat down in the father's Throne now he's going to Grant to us this is our inheritance you are children and being children your heirs heirs not just of anything but of God and join HS with Christ so he grants to the Overcomer to inherit all things to sit with him in his throne as we overcome just as he was gred a privilege and a right as he overcame so we are children and as children were heirs and Acts 20:32 says and now Brethren I commend you to God and Paul in doing so says and to the word of his grace what a beautiful statement I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified quite a quite a statement I going I'm going to commend you to God and to his word of Grace and God through his word of Grace is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified to build up it means to finish the structure the foundation was laid for if he's going to build you up there's a foundation that is laid to build up is to finish the structure to perfect it to raise it up and to uh ornament and and and fill it out that structure was intended when the foundation was raised so it's God and the word are able to build you up because sunship is not just about birth being a daughter of God is not just about birth but it's also the upbuilding and perfecting we're built upon Christ to is assur foundation and now upon that Foundation we need this edification we need the training we need teaching we need the cultivation in order to be built up see that in Ephesians chapter 4 so the instruction ction of God and the word of his grace the admonishment of the scripture the nurture of God is so that he can give us our full inheritance I commend you to God and to the word of his grace if Paul was the father in The Gospel if he was one that birthed them he knew that it's one Waters and one uh plants and there's different works but God's the one that gives the increase it's God that's going to grow them in Grace so he says that God is going to build you up and give you an inheritance among them which are sanctified it's all for the purpose the building up is for the purpose of the inheritance so you say well why grow up well if you're a child of God and you don't grow up I guess it is a question when the young ones don't grow up when the young ones don't grow up kind of like when you know what what what happens when they don't it's posing the question Romans chapter 8:1 17 says and if children then HS Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together I commend you to God under the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified so the building up by the word of his grace is necessary to be given the inheritance and here he says you're children of God you're Heirs of God you're heirs with Christ if you suffer with him we must suffer with him in order to be glorified together with him this suffering is necessary as a child it's necessary as an heir if so be that we suffer with him if so be that we imitate him in that we deny ourselves we follow the will of God we do uh to the father what he did also to the father amen we're join HS with Christ if we suffer as Christ suffered it requires this suffering in order to be granted the same inheritance in Galatians chapter 4 veres 1 to7 going going through this pretty quick tonight we might make it before all the restaurants close it says and now this is uh in this reading there's a lot in the context here to the the Church of galatia a lot more even in this chapter but this principle should be very familiar to us says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all that the image I think has been painted the picture is very clear in the message of the hour I think it's uh clear even in the scripture that a child is an heir it's what he walks through in Romans as a child of God you are an heir so that's the logical conclusion that when one is in the family there's some portion that is allotted to him that he stands to receive especially in the law of the firstborn so The Heir uh is destined to be to be the Lord of all he has an inheritance by relationship to the father but he says as long as he is a child as long as he's immature as long as he doesn't grow up or we could say when he's a child he's no different than a servant the firstborn of a father could be eight years old and he could be the one that stands to receive everything that's in the father's name but he does not have all the rights and privileges of the firstborn granted to him at Birth or even at 8 years old but he's just like a servant who has to do what he's told has certain responsibilities and works within a certain framework and he doesn't have any more privileges as it were he differs not from a servant though he be Lord of all so Paul explains gives us more detail to this so this child who stands to be heir of all things is put under verse two under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so there is tutorship there's Governors there's those that look out after him and train him and child trade him and teach him how things are done so the child is educated and he's disciplined as a child to grow up to a certain time a time appointed of the father a season a moment says even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world now there's a lot here that's uh context to the Jews and their their dispensation of time where they were brought forth under under the law and then there's an ending of their dispensation where in Christ comes to take them out from under the law and bring them into the promised land of the Holy Ghost he says but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of the woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father notice the Symmetry there to where the spirit of adoption that he's given us so now because you're Sons God has given you the spirit he says wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son he's emphasizing to them again you're not servants you are a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ now we could read that and think oh okay well he Circle back to where we don't differ from a servant we're Sons fully adopted fully placed in the body of Christ and that's what the spirit is signifying but the spirit signifies that you're a child the the spirit testifies that you're a son it is a spirit of adoption in that it has a purpose it serves as brother bandam teaches us that here one was given tutors and governors till a time appointed of the father in The Natural brother bam says the Holy Ghost is that tutor for us the Holy Ghost is the inside teacher those that have been born again now it manifestly declares that they are Sons but they're not yes manifested Sons so thou we are no more servants don't ever get to your head that you're a servant you are a son and being a son you're an heir of God through Christ and then Paul if you continue to read begins to admonish them and encourage encourages them to be obedient to finish to persevere to to do those things which are right and again as we said before and the title the title implies that you cannot you may not grow up and again this points to the purpose as we're saying Sunday we wanted to emphasize a couple things this points to that purpose of the Holy Spirit the role of the the Seal of God the indwelling of the Holy Ghost that new birth and as Paul is bringing this parallel of how that a son could be placed under a tutor till a specific time where the father would want to determine whether or not he could receive his inheritance instead of natural development this is Supernatural development by God he's developing Supernatural qualities in the same way that life requires in for in order for us to reach the full potential of our DNA in order for us to reach the full potential of our intellectual ability our physical abilities there are certain things that we must be disciplined in and trained in and learn how to do there's certain things in life they tell if you want to be successful you know make your bed and you think is that it no wonder I'm not successful but there's certain things that they could teach you just have these certain habits and manners of even in how you treat people I have found that some of the most successful people I've met in my life have been people that treat you with uh integ they have integrity and they treat you decently they they show you they show you respect and they give you uh and they they just they'll be friendly to you make you feel good no matter who they are they're not going to Big Time you they're not going to try to make you let you know how much more they know than you and put you down and belittle you and so some of the most successful people are people who just know how to treat other people well it's integrity and and it's a it's the right that really uh uh in some ways could say that every human should have is the right to be treated decently right and so this is there just as those qualities are cultivated and nurtured in the natural through parenting and training and school and exercise that's why even in school I was thinking here recently when I was in college I took I had to take golf weightlifting walking and I think I had another one I just can't remember it must have been a really bad one and it's like why am I pain to show up for a class at 7:00 in the morning to walk it was horrible I'm sure I passed wait liting it was just awful but there is something to the curriculum where they understood that not just book learning was all you needed to do but there was something good in getting the blood going and with exercise and that's why there's PE and recess even in in other uh grades and schools it's a way of it's recognizing that the whole person needs to be stimulated for natural success and this is not natural development this is Supernatural development whatever you could glean from the world that determines what makes one SE successful and they they I think they've proven that it's not necessarily true I don't know if Gladwell just pulled it out of a hat but the 10,000 hours that one would have to use to master something or put into something it's not necessary I don't think it should be a Doctrine or a rubric that just 10,000 hours and you've got it because I think I got sleeping down I haven't done the math but I've probably perfected it but it's the idea that it takes proficiency requires practice and do something over and over again and you stay at it and you work and you work and you work so the same concept applies in this way of natural development it applies to Spiritual Development yes you're born again you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the word of God cries out you are a son you are a daughter the spirit of Christ dwells inside of you you are now a babe in Christ who has the full potential laid out before you to become whatever God wants you to become you just need to learn you need to yield this is that beautiful picture that's being expressed in these things so why grow up you're a child of God born by his spirit and you have an inheritance and having an inheritance God wants to train you he wants to teach you he wants to cultivate gifts inside of you he wants to develop you but it's the process of character development is the work of patience in Hebrews 12: 1-1 this will give us a little bit more on Christ and then that role also for us wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us I'm glad this isn't a natural race I mean as hard as a spiritual one is I didn't like my walking class let alone a running class but it says let us run with patience the race that is set before us that that when the Holy Ghost was G you received the Holy Ghost that bang you heard that shot you heard was the starter pistol and guess what you didn't cross the finish line you just begun this is the start this is the beginning this is New Life new creatures in Christ new laws new responsibilities new power the power of an endless life this is a new beginning and I think all of that is really beautiful to to see and to breathe in and to experience realize the old man's dead now I'm putting on the new man when the old man tries to get Resurrected put them back down bring them under subjection this is the newness of life this is A New Path forward I got a new race now we're to run this race with patience looking unto Jesus who is the beginner the author and the perfector the finisher of our faith he's the one that we began in he is our the the one who pays the price that we can be quickened and not only has he started us but he'll help us to finish and we're to look to him as an example who for the joy that was set before endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds ye have not resist resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children what is why why grow up because as a child you're an heir and being an heir God wants to train you he wants to cultivate you he wants the best for you one of the things that uh they say about being a grandparent is there's a lot of different things they say but they say that um being a grandparent as soon as you enter the room all discipline flies out the window for the grandkids right I think that may have mentioned it here before that it was once I had children and observed my dad as a grandpa that's when I got my Revelation that God is not a grandpa and it was like it makes perfect sense now because there's just not the burden of respons ability uh there's not even the accountability that there's a that a grandparent is supporting one would support the parents in the vision for their children not impose their own they would recognize certain boundaries that the parental care is entrusted in the the dad and the mom and that there's certain respect you want to have for those boundaries and you support them in the vision you don't override it you're trying to dictate or guide it and you certainly don't undermine it you wouldn't undermine it so there is a this relationship that a father has to his child he wants you to he wants the best for you and so he's wants to bring everything out of you that he can once you've now been a babe in Christ and you begin to grow he has all the resources he has all the time don't think that God doesn't have the time for you don't think that God doesn't have the resources for you he's going to give you the time if I by example myself if I've demonstrated to my children that God not isn't always present or that the father isn't always present the father doesn't always have time doesn't always have the right answers doesn't always do it right then I wouldn't want that to reflect upon God because he's always present always has the best in mind is always able always has the time because he wants to see you grow and so it says listen to this exhortation that speaks to you as unto children my son despised not the chasing of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him and I know those are rough words the chastening the rebuke for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth you know you wouldn't expect to see Scourge and love in the same sentence but yet here we are whom the Lord loves he scourges whom the Lord loves he corrects he chastises and he says if you endure chastening God dealth with you as Sons he dealth with you as with sons he's dealing with you as a father would his son we recognize that in terms of Correction and instruction and discipline that that's the proper purview of the parent and that they're the ones that would have a standard and there the ones that would uh govern that and implement it and even correct if it's not met and if you knew well brother Aaron told Jack to never do this and you saw him do it you wouldn't go over there and spank him right right you know I mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do that you may not you may you may not do it instinctively you may not do it consciously or whatever you just it's just it's not your responsibility so this it's the responsibility of a parent to not only instruct but to correct and so God if he corrects you that he's telling you you're a son he says for what son is he whom the father Chase not for verse eight but if you be without Scourge and chastening and chastising and correcting whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons if God's not training you if he's not disciplining you then it's because you're not that you're not in his program furthermore we had fathers this is where the parallel comes right back to the idea of a child being trained and being tutored and being governed for the purpose of coming into the image of the father we had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father's spirits and live so it's a it's a matter of yielding and being subjection to him it's him having preeminence in all things for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous and all the children said amen there's no correction or punishment that seeth to be uh joyous and I can say that if in the moment when you're correcting or scourging or chastising if to the child it's joyous then to the parent it's not joyous so there's no correction that is joyous but Grievious at that time and in that moment but it says nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby exercised by what instruction discipline correction scourging it's cultivation it's growth it's maturity it's harvest he says we are compassed about with these great Witnesses let us run this race with patience looking to Jesus who affords us an example of persevering and looking to the goal and looking to the end and he is the beginner of our faith he is the perfector of our faith the grower of our faith the maturing of the measure of faith that we have and therefore we ought not to be weary when God corrects us because this is the nature of the relationship that God has with his children he's going to chasen he's going to rebuke he's going to Scourge why because he's teaching you he's giving you Revelation he's showing you things in the word he's dealing with your heart therefore we must yield to that instruction and say yes sir and modify when we've been corrected be a subjection to God and know that at the time it may not feel good but if we listen and we obey it produces this yield of a Great Harvest of Peaceable fruit of righteousness so there's instruction cultivation and through this learning and through correction it promotes this growth and there's this maturity and ultimately a beautiful Harvest of the character of God I want to close with a a thought that I know is I debated on whether or not to do it at the beginning because it's just so familiar all the scriptures so familiar you might be able to just quote the scriptures before I even get to them but I wanted to use them in this very familiar setting and and structure together to make this point in light of when the youngans don't grow up and what does it mean to grow up why are we growing up I hope you can see it because as a child you're an heir heirs receive very specific instruction servants don't and the disciples and Jesus he says well the servants don't know what their Master's doing but the son is going to be told this is why this is why why does he telling him because he wants him later to make the same decisions the servants just need to be told what to do they don't need to know the wisdom behind it they don't need to know the reasons behind it they just are told to do it and they do it but we as Sons he wants to impart with to us knowledge and wisdom and understanding and I I thinking about this this past week just how that Jesus Christ we say he Prophet priest and King and he came and as when he came as the Messiah he was a prophet he foretold things to come this is Jesus Christ who is the perfect man he's the one that we make our example he's the one that we should uh that we look to the author and the finisher consider him who endured these contradictions who suffered who persevered Jesus Christ comes as a prophet speaking of a future speaking and prophesying of things to come and then through obedience he's made a high priest descends up on high and there he sets as a high priest he becomes priest and one day will be crowned King it says this in Hebrews 5: 8 and9 though he were a son this is Christ the sinless one yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered quite a phrase he learned he increased in knowledge he learned by practice to learn means to be informed and he's learning before the next verse he's being informed he's being instructed he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation notice un all them that obey him so though he were a son he had to obey and in obeying he became the author of Eternal salvation through obedience Through The Obedience of the cross through the death of the Cross he became the author of Eternal salvation he became the author of our faith and he learned obedience this learning obedience came before the Perfection he learned obedience it was made perfect mean carried completely through it was accomplished he was finished and I say this I believe every time I use this scripture I say this even said it earlier when we're talking about Perfection this Perfection does not refer to being sinless right because Christ knew no sin from birth right he never had sin he didn't have to come to sinless Perfection but then he's made perfect he was already perfect as far as Sin but this sinlessness is not what relates to Perfection he knew no sin was without sin but yet could still be carried through to completion what was it his character was perfected Jesus increased in wisdom and stature Jesus increased in knowledge and wisdom and understanding he learned though he never sinned he still [Applause] learned and therefore he affords us an example in Hebrews chapter 2:1 speaking of God for it became him it became the father it became God it became him this is an act fitting of his divine plan this is an act that is becoming of God's character this is an act that testifies of God's intent for a son it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many son into Glory catch that he's no longer the only begotten son it's not just that one man would be heir to all things but he is destined us to be heir of all things it's not that just one would sit in the throne but as he has overcome to sit in his father's Throne he wants you to rule and reign with him in his throne so in order to bring many sons under Glory it became God and it was uh conducive to his character expressive of his nature to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering Christ though he did not sin though he never made a mistake in a sinless way he still was made perfect this one who is the author of our Eternal salvation was made perfect in Hebrews 5 it says this one who is the captain of our Salvation the one who affords the example was made perfect mature complete whole through sufferings I'm not sure where we mentioned this before if it was this year or in some prior series on this but it's not the this Perfection is not our our quiet suffering and and our private sufferings our our internal struggles that's not what makes your character but I believe this phrase was that how character is made in the Stream of life it's when you're out there amongst the people living a Godly life living a Christian Life and character can only be built through obedience brother BR says perfect character simply cannot be made without suffering and so there's a process of learning and applying he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and tragedy suffering isn't always tragedy suffering isn't always persecution suffering is denying yourself suffering is overcoming suffering is taking the harder way suffering is choosing to do things now for the benefit of a better future suffering is s Define yourself for others sakes that's what suffering is sometimes we think suffering is well I got fired from my job what for well I slapped the guy in the cubicle next to me they're just persecuting me because I was a Christian you laugh you think it's funny I've sat there and heard the guys I've heard uh read a letter one time where somebody quit their job and the letter was a scathing rebuke of their boss for being unchristian and you know what the response was they're just jealous of my wife it's like wait a minute did you do all those things and it's like yeah but they're just jealous of my wife what it's a lack of character say well that's just blessed are those that suffer no no no no no no listen it's also suffering for doing right it's suffering it's suffering by denying yourself it's suffering by uh uh bringing the flesh under subjection brother eler I've just been going back to some statements you made about what character is a and how that it's uh it's not Charisma but what that character really means and that that overcoming I think suffering sometimes is so misunderstood it's the person with Leprosy it's the one with boils it's the one who lost their job it's the one who got run over by car oh their characters being perfected the charact you know a lot of people go through stuff but it never turns them into a belie it never turns them into someone with character some people are abused and they become an abuser some people are lied to and they become a liar some people are offended and they become an Avenger there's a lot of ways that people have not responded appropriately to pressure to persecution to suffering and I believe that as Believers as Sons and Daughters of God you have a quality inside of you to through pressure be turned into a diamond to be properly cut and shaped to fit into the body of Christ to find your place and this suffering is not just the pain and Agony of rejection but it's an everyday process of learning and making application because the flesh Wars against that process and the flesh is going to suffer when we've open obey God and we do what he wants us to do it may it may mean there's a lot of uh humbling ourselves to situations that we just personally don't want and I don't think I should have to do that I don't think I should have to put up with that but yet it is the nature and character of God to humble yourself and do the right thing for the sake of your children for your spouse to live a Godly life and make the right decisions not only for your own Spiritual Development but for the supernatural development of the seed and those that you're leading and guiding and trusted and raising so suffering is overcoming in 1 Peter chapter 2:21 for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow in his steps you got to follow his steps Christ who followed in the father's steps became as the father became raised up to a a seed of Power with Christ with God he is there co-equal with God as it were thought it not Rob to be equal with God he is there made one with the father and Christ who is our example has left a measure of suffering for us that we through suffering would be made perfect because Christ suffered we must also suffer because he is our example and we must follow in his steps says if so be we will be glorified together if so be if we suffer with him to be glorified you're a child of God being a child of God you're an heir and not just an heir of anything but an heir of God and not just an heir of God but joint HS with Christ because you are a child because you are young and birthed by the Holy Spirit you stand to receive in the inheritance of all things and therefore if you are going to be an heir he says we can obtain this inheritance and this glorification if we suffer with him and Peter says we must follow in his steps and if we follow in his steps there must be suffering yes and if there's suffering there's learning and if there's learning there's obedience if there's obedience there's Perfection amen Revelations 1: 6 it says this about us and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever to him be the rule to him be the glory of authority he's made us Kings and Priests unto God and to him be glory and Dominion that's rulership that's Authority that's power for ever and ever Peter said we are a beautiful phrase a royal priesthood a contradiction of terms especially with the division in the Old Testament we are royal priesthood we are Priestly kings that is what we have been made we are priests and kings and we have responsibilities and we have certain services that we have to perform as priests we have certain authorities that we have as kings right now we have dominion being made Kings and there's certain things that we give service to right now being Kings but it's saying we we give this we've been made Kings and Priests and we give him all glory and Dominion forever and ever amen and Paul says this to Timothy second Timothy 2:12 like I said like I'm reading from a script these are all very obvious places to go if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us that's right we have been promised to sit with him in a throne we have been promised to be heir of all things power apart from character is satanic so we must suffer if we're going going to rain if we are going to be granted possession of an inheritance God is going to ensure that when he gives you that full right and full Authority you're mature enough to handle it there are certain rules are uh uh parameters built into Family Trust where to my daughter I give a billion dollars when she turns 25 and has has a doctorate in financial management it's like but until then you can't get a penny of it and it's written right in and the one who's the the the trustee over that estate is going to say I'm sorry you don't have your doctorate yet yeah you're 25 but you've got it's it's built into the trust so that you don't squander your inheritance and there's ways and even God went to such great links in the Old Testament to show that God in his wisdom demonstrated the value of the inheritance to where he had laws built in it that someone was foolish and lost it the family could still get it back CU that's how much he values The Inheritance how much he values The Possession and so God is saying if we're going to Reign he wants to perfect our character he does not have a program where you're born again on Sunday night or maybe it's Saturday night that's when everybody gets born again but you don't get born again on the main night of the camp meeting and the next day you're the one that's going to get up there and go all right come on somebody let me cast out a demon I though you could have all authority given to you in the name of Jesus Christ and you have every right to testify and you can go out and preach the gospel we still recognize and realize that that person has not been cultivated and grown and matured and learned and been seasoned out brother bandam deals with it so often in the message I don't feel like I need to go down that line to make myself clear on this but we've got to re if we're going to Reign we must be taught we must be trained we've got to suffer and if you're not suffering maybe you're not listening if you're not suffering maybe you're not learning would ever want to take away someone's sunship I would say oh well because we're Sons he sent forth his spirit because you are seed you can be born again to him gave you power to become the sons of God not that you weren't already elect not that you weren't in his mind before but the power I believe for everyone here I believe it for my children I believe it for your children children I believe for those who are lost and Wayward now that there's a life germ seed inside of them that if it could just fight away all the muck and mire that's been built around it they can be quickened to life manifest sunship daughter of God and begin to grow in the grace of God learn and Obey and become real Christians so we have been made Kings and Priests in order to fully step into that office and function as a king that can Reign we must suffer right then Revelations chapter 5 Vincent is your license plate Revelations chapter 5 is it verse 5 I've already I said I got dibs if he ever gets rid of it I love it and this is after the book has been taken and the seals have been opened we'll come back to verse 5 in a second it says and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation now if you go back and read some of these things we've been reading in Hebrews you just see how this beautiful fabric woven together of Christ the perfect one who by his own blood has purged our sins and was made higher than the angels to his own obedience this beautiful hymn that's being sung out and hath made us unto our God Kings and Priests that's exactly what he said in Revelations 1:6 and we shall reign on the earth he hath made us Kings and Priests under our God I would say right now your Kings and Priests don't take anything away from it but then it says and now we shall reign on the earth now we can take full possession now we can have full Authority why because verse five and one of the Elder saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof that word there prevailed I know Prevail sounds more like that might he's prevailed right he's prevailed he's conquered but it says he hath overcome to open the book same word he ha overcome to to open the book and to him that overcometh will I grant so instead of always saying well I'm just an overcomer I'm just an overcomer and if it makes it seem like we're just barely getting by I want you to start saying I'm a prevailer because the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book and I believe that God has called you and is encouraging you as sons and of God to not just in your mind get over something but Prevail I'm a prevailer and we have been told in this day that the in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished perfected as yet declared to his servants the prophets and John in Revelations 10: 7-1 he's caught up in this and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and when we were when we're children you know what we would say yeah when I'm done with this okay right if we're a child what do we do we just put it off go go take this book I I just uh children is it okay if I just Bear My Heart Is it okay I can't tell you how many times everybody's getting nervous for my kids never mind I I'll use uh I'll use brother Michael Jenkins kids as an example I can only guess how many times Rowan's been asked to do something 3 hours later it's like hey did you get that done and R's like what what I ask you to do oh I forgot never happened has it yeah see I was wrong so let's go back to my kids I can't tell you how many times it happens when you ask somebody ask one of your children to do something and they forget and you know why because they put it off they don't do it immediately this is what OB be means to do something willfully to do something out of love for God and notice what John demonstrates he says go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went un the angel and said to him give me the little book there's your obedience this is what God wants the Bride of Jesus Christ to come to that way that she packs out his commands she has thus sayith the Lord or keep still what you you have some people running with what they called thus say the lord they're just a bunch of false prophets and then you have other people that just keep sitting still disregarding the real thus sayith the Lord and we've got to have a bride that won't be false prophets but won't also be led to sleep and be starchy and do nothing but a bride that has the mind of Christ to know not what he wants said about the word but what he wants done with the word prevails is what he wants so he goes he says give me the book and now there's a special conversation take it and eat it up amen notice how much more opens up when you obey what is it the angel wants you to yeah he wants me to go take the book he wants me to take the book so we think it's all about taking the book but it's not until you take the book that he tells you what to do next it's not when you have obey it's not until you've obeyed the first part that the next part unfolds take it e it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and so John said well let me think about it I don't really have an appetite I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up he did exactly what he said and it happened exactly as he said it what it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and now he's able to prophesy again to many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings this is a beautiful picture of what God's wanting to do when that which is perfect is come Christ was made perfect by the things which he suffered that is the one that were joint HS with he was made perfect he was brought to completion and became the captain of our Salvation the author and finisher of our faith and then we too are to follow in his steps it's the same process of training the same process of disciplining and as he prevailed to take the book we need to also Prevail to take the book and Prevail by taking the book Prevail because we're eating the book prophesying again to people's Nations tongues and Kings this is why brother Bram could say in the middle of 19659 I believe that we've been children long enough God's going to turn his church into manhood now what was it going to take it's going to take these things to be brought to us the spirit of Truth and we have played and frolicked as children these are words that are descriptive of the age of leody deia and not so much out in the world but the church move we played and Frolic his children is is that is that a a disc is that a a a is that a disparaging term a derogatory phrase that he's using no it's an observation by a prophet we're children when I was a child speak as a child we've expected these things and the way if if the restoration of the gifts brother the last order of the Reformation if the new birth is comprised of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost what would you expect to get babes it proved that it had worked it proved that God was restoring he says but we've played and Frolic as children we've seen enough gifts we've seen enough things happening we've heard enough word we got to come to a place where now God wants to turn his church into manhood and I believe that brother Brandon when he tells us that we're in adoption time and he tells us we've turned a corner and we come to these great things that transpire into Revelations 10 and Revelations 5 that it's telling us that we're no longer in the age of reformation that we're no longer under the cycle of Revival and death but we've come to Capstone time that's why he said it's not a Pentecostal age it's not the L to age it's the bright age because we've come to the age of the consummation we've come to the age of completion and if you try to reject that or redefine it you miss the whole purpose of the message and this is why you'll see waves I haven't been in the message long enough to know this 49 years old and and and and ministering as long as I have and serving God as long as I have I don't have half the knowledge a lot of these guys have but I've learned from them and they've told me the stories and they've demonstrated even the testimonies of their own church that they emphasized the gifts and they tried to teach the gifts and they made a big huge mess so they had to pull back and they had to bring everybody back into order and and and emphasize this and change that and sick and tired of Unholy all this ungodly living and everything and they have to do this and do that and then it go right back into the same thing again right back into the mess again because you don't recognize the age you're in that this is the age of adoption this is the age of maturity and not every age has been the age of adoption every age was the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer but this is the only age where it comes to that fullness he says and we played and frolicked as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity not putting away yourself you're not putting away what God's made you it doesn't mean you're putting the gifts on the Shelf so to speak as some people paraphrase and it's not that they don't have a place because I still hope we're birthing children as I said I Believe on or maybe it was last Wednesday I I hope that there's births and I hope when people are being birthed we don't look down on them and say well you know I've been in this message for 50 years and we just don't act that way well let them maybe you should have when you came in the message before let let's not get so starchy about it but and be mature enough and and have enough Integrity that once those children have played in Frolic long enough they know where the goods are to grow they know where the word is that can teach them and instruct them to overcome let's Stand Together
