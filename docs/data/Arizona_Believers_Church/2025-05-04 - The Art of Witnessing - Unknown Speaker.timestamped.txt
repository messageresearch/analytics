[0:00] Matthew chapter 5 verse 14. Ye are the
[0:04] light of the world. A city that is set
[0:06] on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men
[0:09] light a candle and put it under a
[0:11] bushel, but on a candlestick, and it
[0:13] giveth light unto all that are in the
[0:15] house. Let your light so shine before
[0:19] men, that they may see your good works,
[0:21] and glorify your father which is in
[0:24] heaven. Amen. You can take your seats.
[0:28] I'd like to begin uh maybe over the next
[0:30] several services a little bit a
[0:32] different subject than we've been on
[0:34] previously. And so my title today is the
[0:37] art of witnessing. And there's been some
[0:40] things on my heart in terms of how that
[0:42] we can be a witness, called to be a
[0:43] witness. There's a number of different
[0:45] themes that you could find in the
[0:47] message of the hour in terms of
[0:48] billboards and and ambassadors. And
[0:51] there's a lot of ways that we can look
[0:52] at ourselves in terms of today you have
[0:55] influencers or brand evangelist and you
[0:58] have different ones that have occupied
[1:00] different spaces in order to convey
[1:02] information. And I just believe that
[1:04] there's a role that we play uh in
[1:06] spreading the gospel. And there's a lot
[1:09] of ways that it's done in this end time
[1:12] that uh have you know maybe social media
[1:14] aspects to it or almost like guerilla
[1:16] warfare. There's a lot of Christians
[1:18] today that I think have become
[1:19] terrorist. uh they're just looking to
[1:21] ambush you and attack you. And I think
[1:23] there's just a way that we should go
[1:25] about spreading the gospel uh that is in
[1:27] the manner of Christ in his spirit and
[1:30] that what we're sharing uh has some
[1:32] relevance and it's making a difference.
[1:34] So just looking at this idea of being an
[1:37] effective witness and fulfilling our
[1:39] calling to witness the gospel. If we see
[1:42] here in verse 14 of where we read in
[1:44] Matthew chapter 5, it says, "Ye are the
[1:46] light of the world." And so you are the
[1:49] world's light. So there is a a
[1:51] brightness that's a lamp brightness or
[1:53] lamp. You're emitter of light. A city
[1:55] that is set on a hill cannot be hid. So
[1:57] now Jesus is using these allegorories as
[2:01] it were to describe how it is that you
[2:03] are the world's light. That a city is
[2:06] set on a hill. A city being set on a
[2:08] hill uh is easily seen. The way that
[2:11] it's emitting light and it cast a glow
[2:14] where you can see it. I know that we uh
[2:16] here living in the valley uh if you live
[2:19] in the city, it never gets dark at night
[2:21] because you have so much light pollution
[2:23] reflecting off of clouds and the sky and
[2:25] so there's always this sense of light.
[2:28] Uh you put that city on a hill and
[2:29] you're at a great distance, if you're
[2:31] out in the middle of nowhere, you can
[2:32] still see that light reflecting say that
[2:35] in that direction is that city. Says
[2:38] this again in another way of uh
[2:40] conveying this thought. Neither do men
[2:42] light a candle and put it under a
[2:44] bushel, but on a candlestick. So there's
[2:46] placement of this candle on a
[2:49] candlestick so that it giveth light unto
[2:51] all that are in the house. Says, "Let
[2:54] your light so shine before men." So in
[2:56] the same way that a city is on a hill
[2:59] and it cannot be hid. In the same way
[3:01] that if a candle is lit, it's not
[3:02] hidden. If you put under a bushel, light
[3:05] fire is going to the candle's going to
[3:06] go out. It's going to light the bushel
[3:07] on fire. And at that point, it wasn't
[3:10] really effective. it. It accomplished
[3:11] what it was supposed to do. Let your
[3:13] light so shine before men that they may
[3:15] see your good works. So now he's added
[3:18] something in there in terms of what this
[3:20] light looks like when it shines. They
[3:21] may see your good works and glorify your
[3:24] father which is in heaven. So you are
[3:27] the light of the world and being the
[3:29] light of the world. There's different
[3:30] ways that you could look at this in
[3:31] terms of we already mentioned that
[3:32] you're actually uh you have you're a
[3:34] lamp, you're a light, but it's also used
[3:36] metaphorically of truth and knowledge.
[3:38] And so you are the source of truth. You
[3:40] are the source of true knowledge. It
[3:42] speaks of spiritual purity or moral or
[3:45] spiritual truth. So there's a way in
[3:46] which you you are the ones that hold and
[3:50] possess this knowledge or this
[3:52] truth. In Ephesians 5:es 8 to10, for ye
[3:57] were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
[4:00] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[4:04] light. One thing I want you to think
[4:06] about in terms of him saying that Jesus
[4:09] is saying you are the light of the
[4:10] world. Now Paul's saying now are you
[4:12] light. You are not just a a Christian
[4:16] inwardly but you're to be exposed to
[4:19] view. So it means a city set on a hill.
[4:21] You are the light of the world that men
[4:22] may see your good works. There's
[4:23] something where uh you are a light.
[4:25] You're exposed to public view.
[4:28] Christianity is not a secret affair.
[4:30] Right? There's a lot that can be said
[4:31] about the third pool and it's a secret.
[4:33] It's a secret. Well, we can't use that
[4:35] to mean like we don't want anyone to
[4:36] know. We don't want anyone to know what
[4:38] we believe. We don't want anyone to know
[4:40] that we're Christians and and somehow
[4:42] that's what it's become. It's become
[4:43] more of a cult of personality, uh,
[4:45] clickish and very cultish. And that's
[4:48] not the way that God desires the gospel
[4:50] to be spread. You were sometimes
[4:52] darkness, but now you are light in the
[4:53] world. Walk as children of light. So,
[4:55] it's the way that you conduct yourself,
[4:57] way that you live. This to me is a real
[4:59] key point. For the fruit of the spirit
[5:01] is in all goodness and righteousness and
[5:03] truth, proving what is acceptable unto
[5:06] the Lord. So this shining light is
[5:08] described as we could even say in both
[5:10] of these instances good works where we
[5:13] are emitting a life and this life now
[5:16] you are light. You're living as children
[5:19] of the light and that is going to be the
[5:20] fruit of the spirit. How you live is the
[5:22] fruit of the spirit and it's displaying
[5:24] goodness and righteousness and truth.
[5:27] So, you are something. I could even say
[5:29] you're you're a work of God that is put
[5:32] on display. You are a fruit that is on
[5:36] display. And so, this shining light is
[5:39] described as good works. Now, you are
[5:42] light. Let your light shine so that men
[5:44] may see your good works. Now, just as
[5:47] kind of a a balance to this or an
[5:49] understanding of where it's coming from,
[5:51] in Matthew chapter 6:5, it says, "When
[5:54] thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the
[5:56] hypocrites are." So, there should be no
[5:58] hypocrisy in our good works, in our
[6:01] light. Uh, be not as the hypocrites are,
[6:04] for they love to pray standing in the
[6:06] synagogues and in the corners of the
[6:07] streets, that they may be seen of men.
[6:10] Verily, I say unto you, they have their
[6:13] reward. So there's to be a radiance in
[6:16] our life. There's to be some a light
[6:17] that's being admitted. It's Jesus uses
[6:19] the term good works that catches the
[6:22] attention of one who sees of one who is
[6:25] near, one that is present. But it's not
[6:27] showy. It's not self-s serving. It's not
[6:30] to bring attention to
[6:32] yourself. There has been a phenomena.
[6:34] There's always been a phenomena that
[6:35] existed where people do things to get
[6:37] attention. But now people do it for
[6:39] clicks or to get views. So they can
[6:41] monetize their pranks. they can monetize
[6:43] their good works where uh here's $1,000.
[6:46] I want to give you $1,000. And it just
[6:48] happens to be a camera rolling. Well,
[6:50] they do this to make money, right? It's
[6:52] not necessarily perfectly altruistic. Uh
[6:56] because if you just gave them $1,000 and
[6:58] told them to give it to somebody, they
[7:00] might be like, "Why? Why do you want me
[7:01] to do this?" He said, "Well, I'm going
[7:03] to be rolling the camera and you're
[7:04] going to get followers. You're going to
[7:05] get views." And so we don't want to be
[7:07] caught up in kind of this modern trend
[7:09] of doing it for the Graham. Amen. Doing
[7:13] it for the vine. That's how we used to
[7:14] do it. We used to do it for the vine.
[7:16] But nowadays, a lot of times we do it
[7:17] for the the social attraction and what
[7:20] other people may think about us. And
[7:22] then it's also interesting just as I've
[7:24] been thinking about uh being a witness.
[7:26] A lot of times when we think about we
[7:27] want to be a witness, we want to spread
[7:29] the gospel, we want to reach out, we
[7:31] think about going onto the street
[7:32] corner, going to the state fair and a
[7:34] and and carrying a sign and street
[7:36] preaching or broadcasting things. And I
[7:39] don't believe that's the most effective
[7:40] witness. That's just me maybe sharing my
[7:42] opinion. News flash, brother Aaron has
[7:45] just offered a real hot sports opinion
[7:46] about effective witnessing. Uh but
[7:48] there's a way that that's very popular.
[7:50] Stand on a street corner with a bullhorn
[7:51] saying, you know, you're all going to
[7:53] hell. All you homosexuals are going to
[7:55] burn. You think you're hot now, just
[7:57] wait. You know, there's a uh and people
[8:00] do that as a means of trying to witness
[8:02] truth. And uh and that's a to me
[8:06] sometimes that's just like these
[8:07] hypocrites standing on the street
[8:09] corners so they can be seen of men. He
[8:11] said there's a reward for them. In
[8:14] Colossians chapter 4:5, this is where I
[8:17] think it starts really drilling down uh
[8:20] deeply what's in my heart. Walk in
[8:21] wisdom.
[8:23] Walk in wisdom toward them that are
[8:25] without redeeming the time. This term
[8:28] redeeming the time has great weight.
[8:30] There's a lot that's meant in that. This
[8:32] walk in wisdom. So there's this wisdom
[8:35] of the life that is lived. If someone
[8:37] has wisdom, let it let them show it
[8:39] through the life that they live. And it
[8:41] says toward them. This is what I want to
[8:43] focus on. This phrase toward them that
[8:45] are without. them that are without was a
[8:47] a phrase or a cliche that immediately
[8:50] everyone would recognize as those who
[8:52] don't believe. It would be a phrase used
[8:54] of the Gentile or the heathen by the
[8:56] Jew. And so your character, your
[8:59] conduct, the way that you live your life
[9:01] is for the benefit of those who do not
[9:03] believe. It's for the benefit of those
[9:06] who have not heard. Walk in wisdom. And
[9:08] it's not so that you can impress uh your
[9:11] family or so that you can be really cool
[9:12] at church, but it's walk in wisdom
[9:15] towards them that do not believe. Walk
[9:17] wisely for the benefit of those who have
[9:20] not heard the gospel.
[9:22] In Ephesians 5 15 to1 17, see then that
[9:26] you walk circumspectly. It's a very
[9:29] heavy standard there. Perfectly. You're
[9:30] going to be walking wisely, not as
[9:32] fools, but as wise. So you there's no
[9:35] foolishness. There's no nonsense. You
[9:37] want to walk uh uh very carefully,
[9:39] circumspectly. You don't want to be
[9:40] foolish, but you want to walk wisely. It
[9:43] says, "Redeeming the time because the
[9:45] days are evil." So, in the face of evil,
[9:47] we're living righteously. We're living
[9:49] circumspectly. We're walking in wisdom
[9:52] for the benefit of those that are
[9:53] without. Wherefore, be ye not unwise,
[9:56] but understanding what the will of the
[9:58] Lord
[9:59] is. These phrases to me in Colossians 4
[10:03] and Ephesians 5 are joined together.
[10:05] Walk in wisdom. Do not be unwise.
[10:07] Understand what the will of God is. Have
[10:09] this wisdom, this knowledge. As Jesus
[10:11] said, now you are light. And that speaks
[10:13] of having truth and knowledge and and
[10:15] knowing the the mind of God and having
[10:17] the mind of Christ. Then walk
[10:20] circumspectly. Walk in wisdom for the
[10:22] benefit of those who don't have the same
[10:24] wisdom.
[10:27] Let your light so shine before men that
[10:30] those men may see your good works and
[10:33] glorify your father which is in heaven.
[10:36] Last week I was reading it a little bit
[10:37] differently. Let your light so shine
[10:40] before men and glorify your father which
[10:42] is in heaven. So our works themselves
[10:44] should glorify our father which is in
[10:48] heaven. And then there is this aspect of
[10:51] let your light shine before men so that
[10:54] men who see your good works it has an
[10:57] impact and an effect. This is something
[11:00] that really clicked for me because I
[11:01] used to view this verse as let your
[11:03] light so shine. In other words, let's do
[11:05] good works so that when people see our
[11:07] good works, they just immediately start
[11:08] glorifying God. It's like, wow, that
[11:10] just never works that way. Very rarely
[11:13] does it ever work that way. But it's
[11:14] such that as you walk in wisdom towards
[11:17] them that are without, as you live this
[11:19] life, as you're this light that is
[11:20] shining and you're light in the world,
[11:22] and you have the fruit of the spirit and
[11:23] all goodness and righteousness and
[11:25] truth, that there will be those who by
[11:27] those works turn to God. Amen. And that
[11:30] your life by your testimony. Other
[11:33] hearts are illuminated. And in being
[11:35] illuminated, it leads to conviction. It
[11:37] leads to this awareness. It leads to
[11:39] light shining into their hearts. And
[11:41] then they are converted or they you
[11:44] might use the word saved or they're
[11:45] brought into the body of Christ. So it's
[11:47] by your testimony, by your witness of a
[11:51] life, there's others that would be come
[11:53] in contact with it. And they in turn are
[11:55] introduced to that grace and they
[11:58] glorify your father which is in heaven.
[11:59] They praise him for his wonderful works.
[12:01] They praise him for his grace. They
[12:02] praise him for the forgiveness of sins.
[12:05] In Ephesians 2:10, it says, "For we are
[12:08] his
[12:09] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[12:12] unto good works, which God hath before
[12:15] ordained that we should walk in them."
[12:18] We are his handiwork is how some
[12:20] translations render this. We are his
[12:22] workmanship. That which has been made.
[12:24] You are his work of art.
[12:27] And what one of the things that
[12:29] originally inspired this thought is when
[12:31] there is an incredible uh piece of art
[12:34] or something has been created, if
[12:36] everyone is looking at it the right way
[12:39] and understands that it's been made by
[12:42] someone, the artwork itself does not
[12:44] receive the honor, but the artist or the
[12:46] one who created it is the one that is
[12:48] praised. And often times you look at
[12:50] something, you're like, "Yeah, I looks
[12:54] okay." Okay. And then they tell you who
[12:55] painted it and you're like, "That's
[12:57] awesome." Right? How many of us could
[12:59] look at something, say, "Well, I mean,
[13:01] it looks looks kind of cartoonish." And
[13:02] then someone says, "Well, that's an
[13:04] original bank scene." We're like, "I
[13:05] thought there was something special
[13:06] about that. I could just tell im
[13:09] immediately the messaging was perfect."
[13:11] And so, it's the artist that is the one
[13:14] that is praised, that gets the credit.
[13:16] And in this in this way, I want you to
[13:18] think of yourself as being that
[13:21] artwork that this work of God that
[13:24] ultimately when your life is viewed, the
[13:27] praise is given to the one who made you.
[13:30] For you are his workmanship created in
[13:32] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[13:36] hath for before ordained that we should
[13:38] walk in them. So you are made for the
[13:40] purpose of these good works. Jesus has
[13:42] told us that these good works aren't
[13:44] simply to check a box or to make us look
[13:47] good for ourselves or to impress God.
[13:49] Though we are pleasing him in doing
[13:50] this, God places you as light. Whether
[13:54] it be as a city set on a hill or as a
[13:56] candle that has been lit and placed on a
[13:59] candlestick so that it can give light,
[14:01] God places this light for the purpose,
[14:03] catch this, of shining light or
[14:06] providing light for others. Amen.
[14:10] You're set on a hill. You're put on a
[14:12] candlestick so that others may benefit
[14:15] by it. So this is at the heart of
[14:17] witnessing. I want you to recognize this
[14:18] part as Lord willing. Maybe we'll even
[14:21] minister on the heart of a witness. But
[14:24] this the real at the core and at the
[14:25] heart of witnessing is so that others
[14:28] can partake in that same goodness.
[14:31] So that others could come to know the
[14:33] same righteousness. so that somebody
[14:35] else beyond yourself can know truth and
[14:39] come to know
[14:41] Christ. We don't ever want to just live
[14:43] our lives so that we can we're just
[14:45] trying to prove other people wrong.
[14:48] We don't want to have that kind of
[14:49] attitude. And it's like, so you mean if
[14:51] they know truth, their damnation will be
[14:54] greater? Come here, let me tell you
[14:56] something. I want you to know something.
[14:57] Something that's happening in this end
[14:58] time and do it in some sort of
[15:00] vindictive way just to prove Yeah. See,
[15:02] they're not spiritual. See, no. have
[15:03] shouldn't be at the heart of it at all.
[15:06] Deuteronomy 4:es
[15:08] 5-9. This is uh where I want to just
[15:12] amplify this thought of that we are a
[15:15] witness in our lives or for the benefit
[15:16] of others who don't have the same life,
[15:19] have not come to know Christ in the same
[15:20] way that you have. Behold, I have taught
[15:22] you statutes and judgments even as the
[15:25] Lord my God commanded me. Now, I want to
[15:27] just pause for a moment. One thing that
[15:29] I've been thinking about a lot lately
[15:32] and with some of the services that I'm
[15:33] going to be ministering coming up uh and
[15:35] even some of the meetings that I have is
[15:37] one thing and just even entering into
[15:39] feeling for other people is I want
[15:42] people to know that there's victory over
[15:44] certain things
[15:46] that if somebody has lived a life of
[15:48] anxiety or depression and wrestled with
[15:50] suicidal thoughts or their struggle with
[15:53] mental health or something, I want them
[15:54] to know that there's a place that you
[15:55] can get and you can be free. want people
[15:57] to know there's a real joy, there's a
[15:59] real satisfaction, that there's real
[16:01] healing, there's real deliverance. And
[16:03] and we want to convey that that realness
[16:06] of the gospel for others. And how else
[16:08] are they going to know it? It are the
[16:10] best and most effective witness of that
[16:12] is going to be somebody who says, "Look,
[16:14] I know." Yeah. This is what God's word
[16:17] says, and I know it's true.
[16:20] So then here, now let's just back up.
[16:22] I've taught you statutes and judgments.
[16:24] And this is now as Moses had been given
[16:26] these and they've been taught as the
[16:28] Lord my God commanded me. These statutes
[16:31] and judgments you have been taught that
[16:32] you should do so in the land with you go
[16:35] to possess it. So what I have taught you
[16:37] in the wilderness you're continue you
[16:39] continue to do in the
[16:41] land. Keep therefore and do
[16:44] them. We following now uh uh where this
[16:48] where this is coming from in terms of
[16:49] where uh each one of us are in this.
[16:53] These are the script. These are the
[16:54] things that I've given you to do. And
[16:56] and maybe I don't have this slide in
[16:58] there, so I apologize. Behold, I've
[17:00] taught you statutes and judgments, even
[17:02] as the Lord my God commanded me. Keep
[17:04] therefore and do them, for this is your
[17:06] wisdom and your understanding in the
[17:09] sight of the nations. Notice how that
[17:12] we're to let our light shine. This light
[17:14] that we shine is the the wisdom of God,
[17:18] the knowledge of God. Now are you light
[17:20] with the fruit of the spirit, which is
[17:21] goodness, righteousness, and truth. Walk
[17:23] in wisdom towards them that are without.
[17:26] Live circumspectly, not as fools, but as
[17:29] the wise who understand what the will of
[17:31] God is. So each one of these scriptures,
[17:33] we could see in some form with Moses is
[17:37] saying to the children of Israel that
[17:39] the word that I have given you is your
[17:41] wisdom and your understanding
[17:44] in the eyes of other nations.
[17:47] Amen. which shall hear of all these
[17:49] statutes and say, "Surely this great
[17:51] nation is a wise and understanding
[17:54] people." Do you notice how what the
[17:56] response is going to be to these other
[17:58] nations who don't have this and who
[18:00] don't live this? And they're going to
[18:01] say, "There is great wisdom in these
[18:03] things." And they say historically that
[18:05] a lot of the cultures and nations did
[18:07] adopt the Mosaic law and these certain
[18:09] patterns and certain characteristics of
[18:11] this law for their own systems.
[18:14] Your wisdom and understanding in the
[18:16] eyes of others is what is going to be
[18:18] seen as you keep these. And Moses says,
[18:21] "For what nation is there so great who
[18:22] hath God so nigh unto them, even the
[18:25] Lord our God is in all things that we
[18:26] call upon him for? In what nation is
[18:29] there so great that hath statutes and
[18:30] judgments so righteous as all this law
[18:33] which I set before you this day?" I
[18:36] believe this is the truth about the word
[18:38] of God. Amen. that there no one has a
[18:41] word like this
[18:43] that this that this Bible the wisdom
[18:45] that it contains these statutes and
[18:47] these judgments there there's no other
[18:49] religion that has a god nigh to them
[18:52] there there's no other religion out
[18:54] there that has a spirit associated with
[18:56] it of the spirit of Christ says only
[19:00] take heed to thyself and keep thy soul
[19:02] diligently lest thou forget the things
[19:04] which thine eyes have seen and lest they
[19:07] depart from thy heart all the days of
[19:09] thy life, but teach them thy sons and
[19:11] thy sons sons. Right? The statute and
[19:15] the laws or the statute and judgments.
[19:17] That's the law. It was divine
[19:20] instruction that Moses is saying, it
[19:21] contains wisdom and understanding. And
[19:24] in the learning of it, as it says, teach
[19:26] your children. You learn it yourself in
[19:28] the keeping. And the learning, the
[19:29] keeping demonstrated wisdom. It
[19:32] demonstrated the understanding of God as
[19:36] they were kept and as they were lived.
[19:37] And these things were demonstrated
[19:39] through obedience, the Gentiles would be
[19:41] influenced by it. The way that the
[19:44] Hebrews viewed this scripture and the
[19:46] way that they approach it is that by our
[19:48] living and by our obedience that there
[19:50] will be Gentiles who will be influenced
[19:52] to reject idol worship because they
[19:54] worship these false idols and there's no
[19:56] God nigh unto them and there's no uh
[19:58] there's nothing that breaks forth from
[20:00] it. There's no vindication. There's no
[20:02] miracles and signs and wonders that
[20:04] would follow. So the Gentiles would be
[20:06] influenced to reject their false gods
[20:08] and serve the one true God. In other
[20:11] words, God wanted Israel to be an
[20:14] example. And he's asking them to witness
[20:17] by their works, not their words. As I
[20:21] was studying this, I found it very
[20:22] interesting that at no point was there a
[20:25] call to Israel in the Old Testament to
[20:29] go into all the world and preach the
[20:30] gospel. Right? Now, we can get very
[20:33] technical and say yes. You won't find
[20:34] that in the Old Testament. But there was
[20:37] they were to live and conduct themselves
[20:39] as a people, as a society, and as a
[20:41] nation. And as a whole, that would
[20:44] convey the greatness of God. Amen. They
[20:47] were to be an example. They were to
[20:48] witness by their
[20:49] works. In 1 Peter 2:es 11 and 12, and
[20:54] and let me say this again, summarizing
[20:56] Deuteronomy chapter 4, they were
[20:59] receiving the wisdom and knowledge
[21:01] understanding of God through the law.
[21:03] And as they kept that, it would
[21:05] demonstrate wisdom and understanding to
[21:07] the Gentiles.
[21:10] In 1 Peterap 2 11- 12, dearly beloved, I
[21:13] beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
[21:15] abstain from fleshly lust, which war
[21:18] against the soul, having your
[21:20] conversation honest among the
[21:23] Gentiles, that whereas they speak
[21:25] against you as evildoers, they may by
[21:28] your good works, which they shall
[21:30] behold, glorify God in the day of
[21:33] visitation.
[21:35] The day of visitation is not readily
[21:37] understood in this scripture and what it
[21:40] might
[21:41] mean. But it does speak to the idea that
[21:44] if you are if you have good works and
[21:47] you're not evildoers, in other words,
[21:48] you're not breaking laws and you're not
[21:50] doing things that would violate the
[21:52] trust of the Gentiles or be um evil in
[21:56] itself. that if you have a this honest
[21:59] life, this conversation, have your
[22:01] conversation, your life
[22:03] honest before the people, before the
[22:06] Gentiles, your good works as they behold
[22:09] them will glorify God in the day of
[22:12] visitation. Again, it's it goes back to
[22:15] Matthew chapter 5. We see it in
[22:16] Deuteronomy 4. We see it in Colossians
[22:18] and Ephesians that the life that you
[22:20] live will have an impact on those that
[22:22] are witnessing it. The unbeliever, the
[22:24] one that's never heard before. And in
[22:26] that day of visitation, at some critical
[22:29] moment, whether it be you that is
[22:30] accused of something, there will be this
[22:32] testimony. No, this man does good works.
[22:34] Or when the gospel visits that one,
[22:38] sir, that there's this realization that
[22:40] it is God who has done this. That this
[22:43] is the work of the Lord. So we are to
[22:46] have our lives
[22:49] honest among the
[22:51] Gentiles that they may behold our good
[22:53] works and glorify our father which is in
[22:56] heaven.
[22:58] 2 Kings chapter 5 I'm going to read
[23:00] verses 1 to18 I want to give this
[23:02] example of
[23:03] non and in his healing and how that in
[23:08] this there was a just by the simple
[23:12] testimony of one person we
[23:19] see
[23:22] how the impact of being a witness just
[23:25] have here just a little maid's witness
[23:26] this. Let's just read through this. I'm
[23:29] wanting just to convey the story. And so
[23:31] I trust that we're able to see this.
[23:33] Now, non captain of the host of the king
[23:35] of Syria, was a great man with his
[23:37] master in honorable because by him the
[23:40] Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.
[23:42] He was also a mighty man in valor, but
[23:44] he was a
[23:45] leper. And the Syrians had gone out by
[23:48] companies and had brought away captive
[23:50] out of the land of Israel a little maid.
[23:53] And she waited on Non's wife. She is a
[23:56] captive. She has been made to be a
[23:58] servant in the house of one who has
[24:01] conquered their
[24:02] nation. And this is a great man. I think
[24:04] the scripture want us to understand that
[24:06] non is a great man, a man of valor. He's
[24:07] a mighty man, but he has this infirmity
[24:09] of being a leper. And this she was she
[24:13] waited on non's wife. And so as you kind
[24:15] of get yourself in the story, you can
[24:16] imagine that this little Israelite girl
[24:19] is attending to Non's wife. And so she
[24:22] said, the little Israelite girl says
[24:24] unto Non's wife, because perhaps Non's
[24:27] wife was bemoning the fact that her
[24:29] husband was a leper a and was grieved by
[24:32] that or or very heavy in her heart. And
[24:35] so the little Israelite girl says,
[24:36] "Would God, my Lord, were would God, my
[24:40] Lord," speaking of non were with the
[24:42] prophet that is in Samaria, for he would
[24:45] recover him of his leprosy. this little
[24:48] uh maid had some knowledge of the power
[24:51] of God through the prophet, that she
[24:54] knew that God was with Elisha. She knew
[24:57] the power of God to heal even leprosy.
[25:00] And so she's testifying, I I I would and
[25:03] I pray if only non could be with Elisha,
[25:07] could come see Elisha, then she knew
[25:10] that he would be healed. Amen.
[25:13] We see this testimony and witness
[25:15] amongst others who had been with the
[25:17] prophet. Oh, the prophet uh uh or if you
[25:21] had been here, this would not have
[25:22] happened or we know the power lays
[25:23] within your
[25:25] hands. And one went in and told his
[25:27] lord, saying, "Hey, non thus and thus
[25:29] said the maid that is of the land of
[25:31] Israel that there's a way that you can
[25:34] recover from your leprosy. Now, just by
[25:36] this little maid's witness, watch the
[25:38] series of events." And it might seem to
[25:40] be uh so unnoticed. This was not a tweet
[25:44] that was retweeted. This was not an ex
[25:47] that was e reexed by millions. This was
[25:49] something that in itself was a statement
[25:52] to one who is maybe of in heavy heart.
[25:55] And it's repeated now to non. And the
[25:57] king of Syria said, "Go to and
[25:59] go." And I will send a letter unto the
[26:02] king of Israel. And he departed and took
[26:03] him unto him 10 talents of silver and
[26:05] 6,000 pieces of gold and 10 changes of
[26:07] raignment. And he brought the letter to
[26:09] the king of Israel saying, and this is
[26:11] kind of the breadcrumbs here. The king
[26:13] of Syria is now asking the king of
[26:15] Israel, could you could you do us a
[26:18] solid here? Now when this letter has
[26:20] come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
[26:22] sent non my servant to thee, that thou
[26:25] mayest recover him of his leprosy. And
[26:27] it came to pass when the king of Israel
[26:29] had read the letter that he rent his
[26:30] clothes and said, "Am I God to kill and
[26:33] to make alive that this man do send unto
[26:35] me to recover a man of his leprosy." So
[26:38] maybe didn't quite understand who this
[26:41] was to or who this was for. Wherefore
[26:43] consider I pray you and see how he
[26:44] seeketh the quarrel against me. Now
[26:47] there's something kind of in stirred up
[26:48] like this man is uh trolling me. And it
[26:52] was so when Elisha, the man of God, had
[26:54] heard that the king of Israel had rent
[26:55] his clothes, that he sent to the king,
[26:57] saying, "Wherefore hast thou rent thy
[26:59] clothes, let him come now to me, and he
[27:02] shall know that there is a prophet in
[27:04] Israel." I love I love the dynamics of
[27:07] this. It wasn't in the king of Israel.
[27:10] It's that there's a God, Elisha, the man
[27:12] of God. So Non came with his horses and
[27:14] with his chariot, and stood at the door
[27:16] of the house of Elisha. And Elisha sent
[27:18] a messenger unto him, saying, "Go and
[27:20] wash in Jordan seven times, and thy
[27:23] flesh shall come again to thee, and thou
[27:24] shalt be clean." So Elisha does not come
[27:28] to see non. This great man, this man of
[27:30] valor, one who has brought a lot of
[27:32] money and a lot of changes of reignment,
[27:34] a lot of silver, gold, these precious
[27:36] jewels. And when non is treated this
[27:39] way, he's angry. Verse 11, he's wroth
[27:41] and went away and said, "Behold, I
[27:42] thought he will surely come out to me
[27:44] and stand and call on the name of the
[27:46] Lord his God." and strike his hand over
[27:47] the place and recover the leper.
[27:51] Boy, what a This is the gentile way,
[27:53] isn't it? I want that evangelist to slap
[27:57] my cancer. Right. I want him to lay his
[28:00] hands on it. I want him to call with a
[28:02] loud voice, devil. Right. Right. I want
[28:05] I want the demon to be cast out. Aren't
[28:08] And then he's got a problem with the
[28:09] river and not Abana and Farar rivers of
[28:12] Damascus better than all the waters of
[28:14] Israel? May I not wash in them and be
[28:16] clean? So he turned and went away in a
[28:19] rage. Maybe if I could just inject this.
[28:22] Sometimes the witness isn't effective
[28:24] immediately. It sets in motion. Right.
[28:27] Amen. That's the
[28:30] process. We sometimes we think of the
[28:32] work of art and we think of artwork. But
[28:33] what about the labor in creating it? The
[28:37] process to come to that product. And his
[28:39] servant came servants came near and
[28:41] spake on him and said, notice the wisdom
[28:43] of these ones. He says, "My father, if
[28:44] the prophet had bid thee to do some
[28:46] great thing, wouldest thou not have done
[28:48] it."
[28:50] Remarkable just how much it speaks to
[28:51] human nature. If he'd asked you to do
[28:53] something showy, something flashy,
[28:55] something great, something even hard or
[28:57] difficult, would not have you done it
[29:00] because you you're so desperate for your
[29:02] healing, how much rather than when he
[29:03] say to the wash and be
[29:05] clean. If he told you to do something
[29:08] difficult, go and slay the king of
[29:10] Lebanon. Go and conquer this. Go. He
[29:12] would I got to do this. I got to do
[29:14] this. I want to be healed. He said,
[29:15] "This is very
[29:19] simple." Then he went
[29:22] down, dipped himself seven times in the
[29:24] Jordan according to the saying of the
[29:26] man of God, and his flesh came again
[29:29] like into the flesh of a little child,
[29:31] and he was clean. Amen. He had o he
[29:33] obeyed, and he returned to the man of
[29:36] God. he in all his company and came and
[29:38] stood before him and said, "Behold, now
[29:40] I know that there's no God in all the
[29:42] earth but in Israel." Now therefore, I
[29:45] pray thee, take a blessing of thy
[29:47] servant. But he said, "As the Lord
[29:49] liveth before whom I stand, I will
[29:50] receive none." Notice the heart of even
[29:52] Elisha. He's not doing it for the
[29:54] clicks. He's not trying to monetize his
[29:56] miracles. He's not doing it to try
[29:57] trying to bring glory to himself. He
[29:58] says, "I will receive none of it." And
[30:00] he urged him to take it. So there's this
[30:02] no, please, please take it. He says, but
[30:04] he
[30:05] refused. Pay careful attention to these
[30:07] next few verses. To me, this is the most
[30:09] beautiful part of the whole
[30:11] story. And non said, shall there not
[30:14] then, I pray thee, be given to thy
[30:16] servant two mules burden of
[30:19] earth. He wanted to take the land of
[30:22] Israel enough earth from that land and
[30:27] from that place. B fill up two mules
[30:29] burdens of earth. For thy servant will
[30:32] henceforth offer neither burnt offering
[30:34] nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto
[30:36] the Lord. When he returned back to his
[30:39] pagan land when he returned back to
[30:40] Syria, he wanted to have the ground of
[30:42] Israel. He wanted to have enough soil
[30:45] not as a keepsake but something very
[30:48] practical upon which he could build an
[30:50] altar and he could sacrifice not to
[30:52] false gods but unto the Lord. In this
[30:56] thing the Lord pardon thy servant that
[30:58] when my master goeth into the house of
[31:00] Rimmon to worship there and he leanth on
[31:02] thy hand and I bow myself into the house
[31:04] of Rimon. When I bow down myself in the
[31:06] house of Rim, the Lord pardon thy
[31:08] servant in this
[31:09] thing. The way that it is phrased uh
[31:13] suggests possibly asking for forgiveness
[31:16] of a future
[31:17] mistake. But as I read it and just tried
[31:20] to really weigh it out, there's some
[31:22] there's a repentance that's taking
[31:24] place.
[31:26] Lord, forgive your
[31:28] servant. Pardon me. Forgive me of my
[31:30] idol
[31:31] worship. I purpose in my heart from this
[31:34] time on to serve no other gods but the
[31:38] Lord. By one little girl's witness,
[31:42] seemingly inconsequential, not so much a
[31:45] a demand, well, why don't you go to fi
[31:48] why don't you go find Elisha? Why don't
[31:49] you do this? Why don't you do that? but
[31:51] a testimony that if if he could have an
[31:54] audience with this one in in Israel, he
[31:58] would be made whole. He would be
[32:01] recovered from his leprosy and from that
[32:03] witness and that testimony, not only his
[32:05] name and healed of his leprosy, but in
[32:08] healing, he turns his heart away from
[32:10] the idols to serve God.
[32:15] And he says, "From now on, I will not
[32:16] offer any sacrifice or offering to any
[32:18] other god but the
[32:23] Lord." The art of
[32:27] witnessing it speaks to the skill in
[32:30] testifying, right? And not with your
[32:33] words as much as it is in your
[32:34] demonstration of truth.
[32:38] The act of
[32:41] witnessing is in the shining forth of
[32:45] wisdom for the benefit of somebody
[32:49] else. In 1 Peter chapter 3:es 1 and 2
[32:54] says, "Likewise ye wives be in
[32:55] subjection to your own husbands that if
[32:58] any obey any obey not the word." So as
[33:00] we read this there's speaking to the
[33:03] believing wife to the believing wife be
[33:05] in subject to your husband. And if he's
[33:08] an unbeliever, if he doesn't obey the
[33:10] word, if he's not a message believer, if
[33:12] he's not a Christian, they also may
[33:14] without the
[33:15] word, without the word being preached,
[33:18] without them believing the word, be won
[33:20] by the conversation, the life of the
[33:23] wives, while they behold your chasteed
[33:27] conversation coupled with fear.
[33:31] If I could put it this way, obedience to
[33:33] the word of God of a wife being in
[33:36] subjection to her husband that her life
[33:39] will then testify to the unbelieving and
[33:43] it demonstrates the wisdom of the word
[33:45] without her even speaking. Amen.
[33:50] You realize that uh one of the one of
[33:52] the greatest witnesses a believing wife
[33:55] could have is to serve her husband and
[33:58] not use the excuse that he's not a
[34:00] believer, right? To to forsake her wely
[34:05] duties. When brother Brandham's asked
[34:07] the question, "Well, my husband's not a
[34:09] believer. He doesn't believe this
[34:10] stuff." And he goes to another church
[34:12] and brother Brandham says, "Well, go to
[34:13] church with him." Right?
[34:16] It's really the opposite anymore uh uh
[34:18] in this day and age where we that in
[34:20] Leodysia where it's the spirit of a
[34:21] strong woman that rich and powerful
[34:24] woman who divorced her husband Leis this
[34:27] powerful woman historically in Leodysia
[34:29] and and she could do launch out on her
[34:32] own right
[34:36] and I won't take away the the
[34:39] experience
[34:41] of and I know I'm speaking in very
[34:43] general terms I won't say that that
[34:45] woman isn't a Christian, but she
[34:47] certainly has separated her husband from
[34:50] his best chance of becoming one himself
[34:54] because she can win. That means to gain
[34:57] one to the faith. The husband can be won
[35:00] by the life of the wife as he sees her
[35:05] witness and her character.
[35:08] gain one to faith by seeing this
[35:12] reverential holy life chased
[35:17] conversation. If we put it in if we
[35:19] invert it and look at it in the other
[35:20] way, a believing
[35:22] wife who is not subject to her
[35:26] unbelieving husband dulls the effect of
[35:28] the gospel. Right?
[35:30] find this in other places in the word
[35:32] where it says be careful the way that
[35:33] you act less what you're doing is
[35:36] associated with what you believe and
[35:39] they attribute servants who won't obey
[35:41] their masters to this new religion they
[35:43] have and students who cheat on their
[35:46] test to this cultist following that
[35:48] their parents are in whatever however
[35:50] you want to look at it in second Peter
[35:52] chapter 2:2 and many shall follow their
[35:54] pernicious ways it speaks of those false
[35:56] prophets and those ones that are
[35:57] defiling the character of others by
[35:59] trees of whom the way of truth shall be
[36:01] evil spoken of. Being a bad example
[36:04] leads to criticisms of Christ.
[36:10] Anytime you're associated with a belief,
[36:12] a thought, a brand, a team, a club, or
[36:15] an idea that your behavior is
[36:17] automatically associated with, you if
[36:20] everyone you ever met from a certain
[36:21] city was always just really rude, you
[36:23] just say, "Those people are rude." Every
[36:25] single one of them. There must be
[36:26] something in the water.
[36:29] And so Christianity will be blamed for
[36:32] your bad behavior.
[36:35] In the same way that a child reflects
[36:37] his
[36:38] parents, we as believers reflect that
[36:41] which we claim to believe. Those who
[36:43] profess to believers to be believers but
[36:45] act unwise or disobedient, they reproach
[36:48] the word. They dole the effects of the
[36:51] word.
[36:54] In Acts chapter
[36:59] 4:13, this is
[37:01] the I'm highlighting the effect that you
[37:05] have on others by the way that you live.
[37:08] That there's this is the purpose of
[37:10] witnessing. It's at the heart of
[37:11] witnessing. The heart of witnessing is
[37:14] that others would come to know Christ.
[37:17] This the testimony of non would be
[37:19] tremendous even if it was it ended with
[37:21] him getting healing from his leprosy.
[37:22] That's wonderful.
[37:25] That's a wonderful effect of the
[37:28] gospel in Acts chapter 4:13. Now when
[37:31] they saw the boldness of Pete and John
[37:33] and perceived that they were unlearned
[37:35] and ignorant men, they marveled and they
[37:37] took knowledge of them that they had
[37:38] been with
[37:40] Jesus. their their actions, the way they
[37:43] con carried
[37:44] themselves gave notice. Not just that
[37:47] these men of the Sanhedrin, these men of
[37:49] the Pharisees and these men of
[37:51] importance had witnessed Peter and John
[37:54] with Jesus historically, but there's a
[37:56] greater depth to this that brother
[37:58] Brandham consistently brings out that
[37:59] they had seen the life of Christ being
[38:02] reflected through their lives that they
[38:04] were
[38:05] living. They were reflecting the life
[38:08] and teaching of the one that they
[38:10] followed.
[38:12] There wasn't such a tremendous
[38:13] departure. Say, "Well, I saw these guys
[38:16] following Christ." But now that Christ
[38:18] is gone, they're doing their own thing,
[38:20] right? Uh they're launching out doing
[38:22] other things, and this isn't what Jesus
[38:24] did. But they could tell that the one
[38:26] who taught those things, the one that
[38:28] did that thing before was now in them.
[38:32] Then the boldness of Peter and
[38:35] John, though they were ignorant and
[38:38] unlearned, the wisdom of Christ, the
[38:40] knowledge of Christ, the reasonleness,
[38:42] the the meekness of Christ was being
[38:44] demonstrated in
[38:45] them. Acts 11
[38:49] 26 says, "And when he had found them, he
[38:52] brought him unto Antioch." And this is
[38:54] the phrase we'd like you to see is and
[38:57] it came to pass that a whole year they
[38:58] assembled themselves with the church and
[39:01] taught much people and disciples were
[39:05] called Christians first in
[39:08] Antioch. Christians that Christianos a
[39:11] follower of
[39:15] Christ. We could look at this and say
[39:17] maybe this was a term of
[39:19] derision that they did it in a way that
[39:21] was mocking. But notice the disciples
[39:23] didn't call themselves Christians. We
[39:26] call ourselves believers. We call
[39:27] ourselves Christians. We call ourselves
[39:29] all sorts of things. But this term
[39:32] Christian was something that the people
[39:34] at Antioch gave the believers as they
[39:38] called are called disciples. As they
[39:40] gathered together to teach and they
[39:42] assembled together and they loved one
[39:43] another and they served one another and
[39:44] they taught obeying the teachings. They
[39:47] were called a disciple, a follower of
[39:50] Christ. They gave them the name
[39:52] Christian because they obeyed the
[39:54] teachings of
[39:55] Christ. A follower of Christ is one who
[39:58] imitates Christ. One who follows after
[40:01] Christ.
[40:03] In the sermon, God's chosen place of
[40:05] worship, brother Brandham drawing from
[40:06] the Acts chapter 4 and even I think it
[40:09] has application here. He says in his
[40:11] promised word, you won't have to
[40:13] interpret it. He will interpret it
[40:15] through you.
[40:17] what you are doing what he promised to
[40:20] do. The church that follows him will be
[40:23] so much like him until the people will
[40:26] know.
[40:28] I've had to I I've had to realize that
[40:30] when brother Brandon puts it in this
[40:31] language, it's not that we're going to
[40:33] be able to achieve such a balanced,
[40:36] unoffensive, loving, sweet Christian
[40:38] life so that everyone's
[40:41] like Aaron McGiri just just leave him
[40:44] alone. He is just God incarnate. You
[40:48] know, he loves everybody, treats
[40:49] everybody so well, and has the right
[40:51] answer to every situation. And and
[40:53] though we don't agree with his stance on
[40:56] all these things, how can you hate him?
[40:57] How can you be offended? Right? It's not
[41:00] that at all.
[41:02] Living living as Christ is going to be
[41:05] offensive to the majority. But our goal
[41:08] isn't to get people to be like, "Oh,
[41:09] they're just so sweet and kind."
[41:12] Yeah. And it's not that people won't say
[41:14] you're evil because you're following
[41:15] this and you're following that. But you
[41:17] must be so much like Christ until others
[41:20] know where Christ is.
[41:23] Where others see that this is a
[41:25] different
[41:27] Christ that more than ever before there
[41:30] we need on earth a true representation
[41:33] of Christianity because it's you say
[41:36] well it was bad 50 years ago. It's a
[41:38] hundfold worse now. Brother Bradom, seed
[41:41] it in the seed form and here it is
[41:42] today. It's more religious but yet more
[41:45] antichrist than it's ever been before.
[41:48] And even as we experience some kickback
[41:51] and and things are being toppled down
[41:53] and it seems there's this resurgence of
[41:55] faith and and religion and they're
[41:57] saying, "Oh my, never before have young
[41:58] men been so gravitated towards the
[42:00] gospel and there's more an upswell of
[42:02] religion in many places." No, no, no,
[42:04] no. Don't don't get uh don't think for a
[42:06] moment that America's having her
[42:08] revival. She rejected it.
[42:12] I found it very interesting in 1956 is
[42:15] when America rejected God.
[42:17] And that's when the phrase artificial
[42:19] intelligence was first introduced.
[42:23] It was the moment you reject true
[42:25] intelligence. The only thing that's left
[42:26] is the artificial.
[42:32] 1 Peter chapter 3
[42:42] 13-17. If you weren't here Wednesday
[42:44] night, you missed first Pete or it might
[42:47] have been second Pete. And I had Power
[42:49] Puffs. I got screenshots from around the
[42:51] world of even Powerpuffs. Is that a
[42:54] cartoon like a thing? because there was
[42:57] these cartoonish characters being, you
[42:59] know, photoshopped into it. And the
[43:02] feedback I got is everyone was
[43:04] wondering, and I took it as a
[43:05] compliment, how is he going to work this
[43:07] into the
[43:09] Powerpuffs? Somehow they had the
[43:11] confidence that I would, and it was just
[43:14] a
[43:14] typo. Powderpuffs is what brother
[43:17] Brandham called
[43:18] them. First Pete chapter 3 to 17. And
[43:22] who is this? Who is he that will harm
[43:25] you? this phrase. I guess I meditated on
[43:27] this a lot longer yesterday than I
[43:29] thought I would. Who is it that will
[43:30] harm you? If you be followers of that
[43:31] which is
[43:34] good, quite a statement.
[43:37] If you follow that which is good, if by
[43:38] your good works, you glorifying your
[43:41] father which is in heaven. I said, who
[43:43] is it that's going to harm you? But and
[43:45] if you suffer for righteousness sakes,
[43:47] happy are you. So who will harm you if
[43:49] you're doing good? He says, "But if you
[43:51] do suffer, if you are harmed for
[43:53] righteousness sake, then you should be
[43:55] happy and be not afraid of their terror,
[43:56] neither be troubled." What a
[43:59] comfort. We know that when we're doing
[44:01] well, we're in the line of duty, God
[44:02] will fight your battles. The only time
[44:04] we should worry is when we know we're
[44:06] being disobedient. And the only worry
[44:09] you should have is that you would choose
[44:10] to remain disobedient
[44:13] because all you have to do is repent and
[44:15] come back to obedience and God is going
[44:17] to fight your battles. So he says, "But
[44:19] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and
[44:21] be ready always to give an answer to
[44:23] every man that askketh you a reason of
[44:25] the hope that is in you with meekness
[44:27] and fear." What a challenge to have the
[44:29] right answer in the in the moment when
[44:31] you're asked, "What's the reason of your
[44:33] hope? Why is it you can keep your head
[44:34] when everyone else is losing theirs? Why
[44:36] is it you don't sweat this hard stuff?
[44:37] Why is it you're worried about the
[44:38] economy? Why is it you're not worried
[44:40] about this cancer diagnosis? Why is it
[44:42] you're not worried about your husband
[44:43] doing this? And why is it why are you so
[44:45] calm about your children? you're raising
[44:47] a bunch of teenagers.
[44:50] You got to have a reason for the hope
[44:52] that is in you. So when you answer the
[44:55] question, it's not self-s serving,
[44:58] but it actually becomes a source of hope
[44:59] for others. Having a good conscience
[45:02] that whereas they speak evil of you as
[45:04] evildoers. So if you're an evildoer or
[45:07] if even they're uh calling you an
[45:09] evildoer as it's already mentioned in
[45:11] chapter two with the this honest
[45:13] conversation your good works will
[45:16] glorify God in the day of
[45:18] visitation. Though they may challenge
[45:21] you as an evildoer they may be ashamed
[45:23] that falsely accuse your good
[45:25] conversation in
[45:27] Christ. Your life will shame the false
[45:30] accusers. For it is better if the will
[45:33] of God be so that you suffer for
[45:34] welloing than for evildoing.
[45:40] If you do something wrong, you're going
[45:42] to pay for it. One thing I have learned
[45:44] that is if you make a mistake as a
[45:46] Christian and you suffer for it, don't
[45:48] be quick to blame the fact that you're a
[45:50] Christian
[45:51] is why you're suffering. Own it and say,
[45:54] "I wasn't honest to that person. I
[45:56] mistreated them. That's why they said
[45:58] the things they did about me. That's why
[45:59] they were ugly. That's why they did
[46:01] this. That's why they did that is
[46:02] because I made the mistake. Sometimes I
[46:05] say, well, you know, blessed are those
[46:06] that live righteously because, you know,
[46:08] they're going to be called all sorts of
[46:09] names and they're only doing that
[46:11] because they don't do just just own it.
[46:14] So, you know, I I handled that
[46:19] wrong. In 1 Thessalonians
[46:24] 4:12, your good conversation in Christ
[46:27] is the witness against the false
[46:30] accusers. Right?
[46:34] In one of these this recitation of all
[46:36] these commands that Paul is giving the
[46:37] Thessalonians, he says that you may walk
[46:43] honestly, correctly, uprightly. Honesty
[46:47] to me, that is really at the heart of
[46:48] this when I was thinking about the at
[46:50] the heart of witnessing, the art of
[46:51] witnessing. this this honesty, this
[46:55] genuiness, that you may walk honestly
[46:57] toward them that are without and that
[47:00] you may have lack of
[47:02] nothing. This walking honestly is toward
[47:05] them that are without, towards the
[47:06] unbeliever, the one that hasn't heard.
[47:09] Walk honestly for the benefit of for the
[47:11] example to them that are without. We
[47:14] know that we live a life in front of
[47:16] others as we come to church and we
[47:17] realize that the way that I respond, the
[47:19] way that I act, I'm an example. And the
[47:21] way I live in front of my children, I'm
[47:22] an example. We know that we're having an
[47:24] influence on those that are watching us.
[47:26] Brother Bam said, you're going to send
[47:27] someone to the bad place. Be careful of
[47:29] your influence cuz someone is watching
[47:31] you. So, we recognize that as a
[47:33] Christian and as an adult and even as a
[47:35] person, no matter what we are, someone
[47:37] somewhere is going to learn from your
[47:38] example. But the Bible's being very
[47:41] explicit that we are to walk honestly
[47:43] for the benefit of those who are maybe
[47:46] dishonest. Walk honestly for the benefit
[47:48] of those who aren't message believers.
[47:50] For those who don't go to church, for
[47:52] those who don't even name the name of
[47:53] Christ, to those who don't even believe
[47:55] in a God, walk honestly.
[48:00] Have a good conversation in Christ. Let
[48:02] your light shine as a city set on a
[48:04] hill. Let your light shine as a candle
[48:07] placed on a candlestick to where the
[48:08] light is not for the benefit of the
[48:10] candle. It's for those that are in the
[48:11] house.
[48:13] Want to walk honestly toward them that
[48:15] are
[48:17] without. I'm just bringing this now
[48:20] bringing this down to a
[48:21] close. And so I I want to use this
[48:24] scripture in Galatians chapter 6:es 9
[48:26] and 10. these two verses a as a way
[48:30] of
[48:32] emphasizing our steadfastness and our
[48:35] endurance to do good
[48:37] works. One of the themes of the um the
[48:41] art of seduction and faith or cake as we
[48:43] ended that that line of sermons was that
[48:46] you can't
[48:47] endure. Real faith will endure the
[48:50] pressure. If it's stomped on, if it's
[48:52] kicked, if it's beaten, whatever, faith
[48:54] will endure. But cake, no, it won't.
[48:57] And so there's this enduring quality of
[48:58] a genuine believer. Not baby, not a hot
[49:01] house plant, but you endure. You
[49:03] persevere continually.
[49:05] Lord, avenge me, my adversary. That's
[49:08] the kind of faith he's looking
[49:10] for. So, we are to do
[49:13] good. We're to walk honestly, walk
[49:19] circumspectly. We're not to follow
[49:21] pernitious
[49:22] ways. We're to have chased
[49:25] conversation, obeying the
[49:28] word and our conversation honest by our
[49:31] good works, glorifying our father which
[49:33] is in heaven over and over and over
[49:35] again. We're demonstrating the wisdom
[49:36] and knowledge of God. So let us not be
[49:39] weary in
[49:41] welloing. For in due season we shall
[49:43] reap if we faint not.
[49:46] Don't be weary in
[49:47] welloing. I believe it's that war of
[49:50] attrition sometimes that causes us to
[49:52] fail that we just we just give up. Done
[49:56] enough, tried enough. I'm just going to
[49:58] give up. And I said, don't. Don't stop.
[50:00] You say, "Well, it hasn't worked to this
[50:02] point." Don't stop. Amen. The Bible
[50:04] gives you a promise. That's what
[50:05] happened. That that woman that unj that
[50:07] woman who went to the unjust judge, she
[50:09] knew the judge was there and she knew he
[50:11] had the power. So, she wasn't going to
[50:13] stop asking. Amen. And the only reason
[50:16] why we would stop asking is if for some
[50:19] reason we didn't believe he was here. If
[50:22] some reason we didn't believe his word
[50:23] was true, but we know that he's here.
[50:26] He's present with us. We know that his
[50:28] word is true. We've seen far too many
[50:30] witnesses already. If you're if you're
[50:32] coming to tell me he's not a healer,
[50:33] seen too much. Come to tell me he can't
[50:36] save. I don't believe that there's going
[50:37] to be a situation of a lost soul that we
[50:39] know of. There would be no example in my
[50:41] family, no example in your family, no
[50:43] example of any kind of testimony. You
[50:45] kind of say, "No, brother Aaron, I know
[50:46] my son, my daughter, this loved one, my
[50:48] wife, my spouse, I know they can't be
[50:50] saved. We've seen too much. We know the
[50:54] power of God to reach down into the
[50:55] deepest and the darkest and the nastiest
[50:58] and the worst situation and redeem.
[51:00] We've seen too much to listen to a voice
[51:02] that says, "You might as well give up
[51:04] now."
[51:06] No, I believe God is more than able. And
[51:09] I want to be a voice even if I even if I
[51:11] don't articulate. I want my life to be
[51:13] such that when someone says, "Oh my
[51:15] goodness, my husband did this. My child
[51:17] did that. It's falling apart. They're
[51:19] going to go to hell." Where you could
[51:20] just say, "Well, they don't have to."
[51:25] What is the thing that you One thing
[51:27] I've I've learned in my with especially
[51:30] with my tremendous relationship I have
[51:32] with my youngest, Jack. I have a
[51:34] wonderful relationship with my
[51:36] youngest as I do with all my children.
[51:39] Smile, Eliza. I was just
[51:41] joking. But if I'm driving and all of a
[51:45] sudden I just notice as take heed to
[51:48] your ways that the traffic's building
[51:50] and it adds an hour to your drive and I
[51:52] go, "Oh no." Jack's immediately like,
[51:55] "What happened? What happened? Are we
[51:57] going to make it?" you know, and and
[51:59] he's concerned and I'm realizing like
[52:01] I'm just I'm not really desparing for
[52:04] life. But if you're sitting in the back
[52:05] seat and you all sitting here, your dad
[52:07] go, I don't believe it. What are we
[52:08] going to do? You immediately start
[52:10] thinking, what are we going to
[52:12] do? And there's a way that we respond in
[52:15] crisis and your response is a witness.
[52:18] The stock market's going to crash. And
[52:20] could you imagine if if your wife ran in
[52:22] the room says, "Oh my goodness, this
[52:24] happened and that happened. The stock
[52:25] market's going to crash." They say,
[52:26] "We're officially in a recession." And
[52:28] you get up, you go, "Oh, goodness
[52:30] grac No, dude. Please don't tell me that
[52:33] Coca-Cola stock is crap. What are we
[52:34] going to do? I had everything in Tesla."
[52:37] Everything in Tesla.
[52:44] It's a witness.
[52:47] Speak something.
[52:50] I don't want to be weary and welloing.
[52:52] The Bible says there, "As we therefore
[52:54] have opportunity, let us do good unto
[52:55] all men."
[52:56] What does it mean to do good unto all
[52:58] men? Right?
[53:00] Ask yourself that question as you look
[53:02] at who is thy neighbor and the question
[53:04] is asked in the scripture and we have
[53:07] this sense of okay the neighbor's the
[53:08] one that stopped and rendered aid. And
[53:10] if we try to take that to mean that I've
[53:12] got to stop and help everybody who's
[53:13] needy will never make it home.
[53:18] We we'll be broke with all the pan
[53:20] handlers,
[53:22] right? With all the needs. We'd never
[53:24] make it home with every car on the side
[53:25] of the road with the hood up. What do
[53:27] you need? Oh, you need fluid. Uh, you
[53:28] know, okay, I'll go get you some. Go a
[53:31] few more miles. Oh, you have a flat
[53:32] tire. Let me fix your tire for you. You
[53:35] realize that's not what it means. So,
[53:37] what does it mean to do good unto all
[53:41] men? Think about it. Especially unto
[53:44] them who are of the household of faith.
[53:50] Let's not be weary in doing what we know
[53:52] is right.
[53:54] like to use the last as my last example.
[53:56] I want to use the example of Daniel.
[53:59] It's Haniah, Azariah, and Mishael. Those
[54:01] four, and how that
[54:05] they just like that little maid that was
[54:07] brought as a servant to non's
[54:10] wife, kidnapped, exiled, they're going
[54:12] to be brainwashed
[54:15] uh to speak Calaldian and to eat the
[54:17] food of the Caldanss. They tried to in
[54:19] offering
[54:20] them the wine and the meat. It was it
[54:24] whe if it was overt or not, I don't
[54:25] know. But to me, I suspect that it was
[54:27] intentional because they knew according
[54:30] to the word of God to the Israelites
[54:31] that to eat that meat and drink that
[54:33] wine would violate the word of
[54:35] God. So, it wasn't their opportunity to
[54:38] eat well, but it was also a temptation
[54:39] to break the word. Amen. But the Bible
[54:42] says in Daniel 1:8 that he purposed in
[54:44] his heart that he would not defile
[54:46] himself with the portion of the king's
[54:47] meat, nor with the wine which he drank.
[54:49] Therefore, he requested of the prince of
[54:50] the Enix that he might be brought that
[54:52] he might not defile himself. And what he
[54:54] asked, "I just want vegetables and
[54:56] water." And by his witness, three others
[54:59] joined
[55:00] in. By his stand for truth, Daniel
[55:03] influenced Haniah, Azaria, and Mishiel.
[55:05] And they together made a deliberate
[55:09] decision not to refuse wine and not to
[55:11] refuse meat, but to not violate God's
[55:13] statutes and judgments in the face of
[55:16] pressure. They weren't the only four
[55:18] that were kidnapped. I don't know how
[55:20] many it might have been. There could
[55:21] have been hundreds, if not thousands of
[55:22] other Hebrew boys that said, "We're
[55:24] going to eat good
[55:26] tonight. We're going to drink good.
[55:28] Maybe get a little buzz on. Have some
[55:30] nice red meat." But in the face of
[55:32] everyone else who might have been going
[55:33] the wrong direction, they said, "No,
[55:34] we're not going to do it. were not going
[55:35] to violate God's word. And in making a
[55:38] stand for God's word in verses 16 to 20,
[55:42] the servant took away their portion of
[55:43] meat and wine and gave them
[55:45] pulse. And it says, "And as for the four
[55:48] children, God gave them knowledge and
[55:50] skill and all learning and wisdom. And
[55:52] Daniel had understanding in all visions
[55:54] and dreams. And at the end of the days,
[55:56] and the king said they should bring
[55:57] these young ones, the prince of the Unix
[55:59] before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king then
[56:01] is inquiring of them and looking. It
[56:02] says, "And among them was found none
[56:04] like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
[56:07] Azariah. Therefore stood they before the
[56:09] king, and in all matters of wisdom and
[56:13] understanding." Where did it begin? With
[56:15] making a decision to honor God's word
[56:18] and honoring God's word. They already
[56:20] demonstrated wisdom. They already
[56:21] demonstrated understanding. Now, God
[56:23] blesses them that the king inquire of
[56:25] them. He found them 10 times better than
[56:27] all the magicians and astrologers that
[56:28] were in all his realm. Right?
[56:33] Nebuchadnezzar surrounding himself with
[56:34] magicians and astrologers. He's pagan.
[56:37] He's heathen. You know, in Jan Daniel
[56:39] chapter 2 that he has a dream and it's
[56:41] only Daniel that's able to interpret it.
[56:42] He's so impressed by that that he makes
[56:44] a statue of Daniel and commands that
[56:46] everyone would worship him. This image
[56:49] of Daniel, Haniah, Azariah, Misha refuse
[56:52] to bow down. What are they doing? Thou
[56:53] shalt have no other gods before you.
[56:55] They're following. They're honoring the
[56:57] word of God. They're not they're not
[56:58] distant on Daniel.
[57:00] Listen, sometimes people I I've even
[57:03] I've even found myself in fellowship
[57:04] where people are uh
[57:06] uh as a young man, you say, "Oh, brother
[57:09] Aaron, I know where that's going to get
[57:11] you. You're going to end up rejecting
[57:12] the message and you're going to do this.
[57:13] You're going to I know where that
[57:14] spirit's coming from." All because you
[57:16] wouldn't make Brother Brandham more than
[57:18] what Brother Brham made himself.
[57:22] And it was no offense to Daniel that
[57:24] they didn't bow down to the idol of him.
[57:25] Right?
[57:27] And you're not going to offend brother
[57:28] Brandham if you if you don't make him a
[57:29] god.
[57:32] He said he'd rather face God as an
[57:33] antichrist as a quitter than an
[57:35] antichrist.
[57:36] So there was no offense to the prophet
[57:38] nor was there uh but it was an offense
[57:40] to the king and the king said we're
[57:42] going to toss these three into the fiery
[57:43] furnace. And what happens? They live.
[57:46] And this is what Nebuchadnezzar speaks
[57:47] as we see in the end of Daniel chapter
[57:50] 3. He says, "Blessed be the God of
[57:52] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has
[57:54] sent his angel and delivered his
[57:56] servants that trusted in him, and have
[57:58] changed the king's word and yielded
[58:00] their bodies that they might not serve
[58:02] nor worship any god except their own
[58:05] God." It's starting to it's starting to
[58:08] dawn on Nebuchadnezzar more now. He
[58:11] doesn't accept as he sees the witness of
[58:14] Daniel and these three Hebrew children.
[58:16] It's not at that moment that he says,
[58:18] "I'm all in on this." But as they
[58:20] maintain their integrities, as they
[58:22] maintain their testimony, now even
[58:24] later, it's bless the God of these who
[58:27] would not serve and worship any other
[58:29] god except their own. And in Daniel
[58:30] chapter 4, it begins with Nebuchadnezzar
[58:32] the king unto all the people, nations,
[58:34] and languages that dwell in all the
[58:36] earth. Peace be multiplied unto you. I
[58:39] thought it good to show the signs and
[58:42] wonders that the high God hath wrought
[58:44] toward me. How great are his signs and
[58:48] how mighty are his wonders. His
[58:51] kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and
[58:54] his dominion is from generation to
[58:56] generation. He's using a language that
[58:59] Christians today
[59:01] sing. The things he says of the one true
[59:04] God.
[59:08] Now, in verse 28, this is I'm just
[59:10] wanting to I know this may seem to be
[59:12] kind of a clum a clumsy uh awkward
[59:15] example at the end, but I'm I'm wanting
[59:16] you just to see through the the life of
[59:19] these these believers, the impact it can
[59:22] have on one
[59:24] person. And there's these things that
[59:26] happen and God is with them, these signs
[59:28] and wonders and these prophecies of what
[59:31] would happen happened just exactly as
[59:33] Daniel said it would. And all this came
[59:34] upon the king of Nebuchadnezzar. And at
[59:36] the end of 12 months, he walked in the
[59:37] palace of the king of Babylon, the king
[59:39] spake and said, "Is not this great
[59:41] Babylon that I have built for the house
[59:43] of the kingdom, by the might of my
[59:45] power, and for the honor of my
[59:47] majesty?" While the word was in the
[59:49] king's mouth, there fell a voice from
[59:50] heaven, saying, "Oh king Nebuchadnezzar,
[59:53] to thee it is spoken, the kingdom is
[59:55] departed from thee."
[59:58] If you notice what's happening here, I
[59:59] put it on this slide for you that
[1:00:01] Nebuchadnezzar gets lifted up in his
[1:00:03] pride and God deals with him as a son.
[1:00:07] Soon as he gets lifted up, God brings
[1:00:09] the chastisement and the
[1:00:11] correction. In I believe it's three
[1:00:14] places in the scripture, he refers to
[1:00:16] King Nebuchadnezzar as his servant.
[1:00:19] says, "And they shall drive thee from
[1:00:20] men, and thy dwelling shall be with the
[1:00:22] beast of the field, and they shall make
[1:00:23] thee to eat grass as oxmen, and seven
[1:00:25] times shall pass over thee, until thou
[1:00:27] know that the most high ruleth in the
[1:00:29] kingdom of men, and giveth to whomsoever
[1:00:31] he will." The same hour was the thing
[1:00:33] fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he
[1:00:34] was driven from men, and did eat grass
[1:00:36] as oxin, and his body went wet with the
[1:00:38] dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown
[1:00:40] like eagle's feathers, and his nails
[1:00:42] like bird's claws. Happened just exactly
[1:00:44] as God said it would. Until what? until
[1:00:47] he knew that the most high ruled in the
[1:00:48] kingdom of men, the one that he had
[1:00:50] professed, his kingdom is an everlasting
[1:00:52] kingdom, his dominion from generation to
[1:00:54] generation. Daniel chapter 5 explains it
[1:00:57] this way. Verses 17 to 20 24. Then
[1:01:00] Daniel answered and said before the
[1:01:02] king, this is a different king, but
[1:01:03] we'll come back to in a moment. Let thy
[1:01:05] gifts be to thyself, and give thy
[1:01:06] rewards to another. He's wanted to pay
[1:01:08] him to give the interpretation of that
[1:01:10] which was written on the wall. Yet I
[1:01:11] will read the writing unto the king and
[1:01:13] make known to him the interpretation.
[1:01:16] Oh thou king, the most high God gave
[1:01:18] Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom in
[1:01:21] majesty in glory and honor. God had
[1:01:23] given this to Nebuchadnezzar. And for
[1:01:25] the majesty that he gave him, all
[1:01:26] people, nations, and languages trembled
[1:01:28] and feared before him whom he would sh
[1:01:32] slew whom he would slew and whom he
[1:01:34] would be he kept alive and whom he would
[1:01:37] he set up and whom he would put down.
[1:01:39] But when his heart was lifted up, and
[1:01:41] his mind hardened in pride, he was
[1:01:43] deposed from his kingly throne, and they
[1:01:45] took his glory from him, and he was
[1:01:48] driven from the sons of men, and his
[1:01:49] heart was made like the beast, and his
[1:01:51] dwelling was with the wild asses. They
[1:01:53] fed him with grass like the oxen, and
[1:01:55] his body was wet with the dew of
[1:01:58] heaven. This is in this verse 21. Till
[1:02:01] he knew that the most high God ruled in
[1:02:04] the kingdom of men, and he appointed
[1:02:06] over it whomsoever he will.
[1:02:09] This is Nebuchadnezzar. This isn't
[1:02:10] Nebuchadnezzar just saying, "Oh, the God
[1:02:12] of those Jews. There's He's a He's a God
[1:02:15] of the mountains and he's a God." It
[1:02:16] wasn't that he just felt like this God
[1:02:18] was getting the best of his God, but he
[1:02:20] was submitting to the one true God.
[1:02:24] So back to chapter
[1:02:26] 4 when Nebuchadnezzar comes to his mind.
[1:02:29] He says, "And at the end of the days I
[1:02:31] Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes into
[1:02:32] heaven. In my understanding returned
[1:02:35] unto me, and I blessed the most high,
[1:02:38] and I praised and honored him that
[1:02:39] liveth forever, whose dominion is an
[1:02:41] everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is
[1:02:43] from generation to generation, coming
[1:02:46] back to his right mind. And all the
[1:02:47] inhabitants of the earth are reputed as
[1:02:49] nothing. and he doeth according to his
[1:02:51] will and the army of heaven and among
[1:02:53] the inhabitants of the earth and none
[1:02:55] can stay his hand or say unto him what
[1:02:56] doest thou at the same time my reason
[1:02:59] returned unto me and for the glory of my
[1:03:01] kingdom my honor and brightness returned
[1:03:03] unto me and my counselors and my lord
[1:03:05] sought unto me and I was established in
[1:03:06] my kingdom and excellent majesty was
[1:03:08] added unto me now I Nebuchadnezzar
[1:03:11] praise extol and honor the king of
[1:03:14] heaven all whose works are truth and is
[1:03:18] judge weighs judgment And those that
[1:03:20] walk in pride, he is able to abase. What
[1:03:24] a testimony. At the end of the day, he
[1:03:26] could come to see God working and
[1:03:28] moving. And these four humble Hebrew
[1:03:30] children that stood by the word of God.
[1:03:32] And ultimately, it has such an impact on
[1:03:34] him to he extols the greatness of God
[1:03:36] and his kingdom. And he blesses him. He
[1:03:39] says, "How great you are." And he and
[1:03:41] he's learning to follow and to trust
[1:03:43] God. He gets lifted up in his pride. But
[1:03:45] God brings them back to a place where he
[1:03:47] says, "I extol the greatness of the King
[1:03:50] of
[1:03:50] Heaven. All his works are truth and all
[1:03:53] his ways are right.
[1:03:57] They're just. And anybody who gets
[1:03:59] lifted up in pride, he'll correct them.
[1:04:05] Musicians, you could come to your
[1:04:06] instruments." This is what this final
[1:04:08] message was from Daniel. After he gives
[1:04:10] the testimony of Nebuchadnezzar, who
[1:04:13] knew that the most high God ruled in the
[1:04:14] kingdom of men, who knew that there was
[1:04:16] only one that should be praised and
[1:04:17] extolled and honored, one whose works
[1:04:20] are truth and his ways judgment. He
[1:04:21] says, "And this his thou his son, O
[1:04:25] Belshazar, hast not humbled thine heart,
[1:04:28] though thou kneest all
[1:04:31] this?" In other words,
[1:04:34] Nebuchadnezzar was a witness.
[1:04:37] He was an
[1:04:39] example, but hast lifted up thyself
[1:04:42] against the Lord of heaven. And they
[1:04:44] have brought the vessels of his house
[1:04:46] before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy
[1:04:48] wives, and thy concubines, and have
[1:04:49] drunk wine in them. And thou hast
[1:04:50] praised the gods of silver and gold, and
[1:04:52] of brass, iron, wood, stone, which see
[1:04:54] see not, nor hear, nor know. And the God
[1:04:58] and whose hand thy breath is, and whose
[1:05:01] are all thy ways, hast thou not
[1:05:04] glorified. Then was the part of the hand
[1:05:06] sent from him and this writing was
[1:05:09] written. Now it's this moment that this
[1:05:13] writing is written upon the
[1:05:15] wall. Daniel's going to interpret it and
[1:05:20] he's going to tell him what's to become
[1:05:21] of
[1:05:22] him. But before he does, he wants to he
[1:05:26] wants Belshazar to know exactly where he
[1:05:28] went wrong. And he said, "You knew
[1:05:31] better." And how did he know better? the
[1:05:33] witness of the king before
[1:05:36] him wasn't raised in a godly home.
[1:05:39] Wasn't brought up serving the one true
[1:05:42] God. Was not made king through a
[1:05:43] ceremony whereby he was anointed by a
[1:05:45] prophet to be the
[1:05:47] king, a heathen king, a pagan king, an
[1:05:50] idol worshipper witnessed the worship of
[1:05:53] the one true God. And in time his heart
[1:05:55] was
[1:05:57] turned to extol the greatness of God to
[1:06:01] give honor to the king of
[1:06:04] heaven. And Balshazar knew
[1:06:06] better because of that
[1:06:10] witness. So it's not that our witness is
[1:06:12] always going to be effective to
[1:06:14] determine whether or not it was
[1:06:17] right. We may not ever see the results
[1:06:20] of it, the rewards, or even the
[1:06:21] consequences of it in this life.
[1:06:24] But I want you all to recognize that you
[1:06:26] have been called and placed whether on a
[1:06:29] hill or a candlestick somewhere in your
[1:06:30] life. No matter how young you are, no
[1:06:31] matter how old you are, God wants you to
[1:06:33] be a witness.
[1:06:35] And we're called to be that. And may God
[1:06:38] help us to be a true witness.
[1:06:42] May our works be good. May they be light
[1:06:46] that expresses hope to others. Not so
[1:06:48] much in my ability to explain the
[1:06:50] Godhead.
[1:06:52] No, not so much in my ability to just
[1:06:54] pick out just the right sermon for them
[1:06:56] to listen to. But Lord, let my life be
[1:06:59] an unfolding of a
[1:07:01] witness. Maybe we could even go back and
[1:07:04] apologize to some if we recognize, you
[1:07:06] know what, I haven't been a good
[1:07:07] witness. And we don't have to say, hey,
[1:07:08] look, I'm sorry. I haven't really
[1:07:10] reflected things correctly. I haven't
[1:07:12] really been a good example for Christ.
[1:07:13] Apologize for what you've done
[1:07:16] wrong. It can be a starting
[1:07:18] point. God, help us to be witnesses.
[1:07:22] pray about it. I even invite questions
[1:07:24] or anything that you might be triggered
[1:07:26] in your heart as we desire to please the
[1:07:28] Lord and meet your needs. Let's all give
[1:07:30] some thought to this ourselves. How can
[1:07:32] we be better witnesses? How can we
[1:07:34] effectively evangelize the valley? How
[1:07:36] can we see that all these seats are
[1:07:39] filled and not so much of message
[1:07:42] believers but converts to Christ, souls
[1:07:45] that are being saved. Let's stand
[1:07:47] together today. Let's just worship the
[1:07:49] Lord as we have this
[1:07:51] opportunity. Oh, and
[1:07:55] in
[1:07:57] my
[1:07:59] life,
[1:08:02] Lord, be glorified.
[1:08:07] be
[1:08:10] glorified
[1:08:12] in
[1:08:14] my
[1:08:17] life.
[1:08:19] Lord, be
[1:08:23] glorified
[1:08:25] today. Sing it again. Oh, and
[1:08:30] in
[1:08:32] my
[1:08:34] life,
[1:08:36] Lord, be
[1:08:40] glorified. Oh, be
[1:08:45] glorified
[1:08:47] in
[1:08:49] my life.
[1:08:53] Lord be
[1:08:57] glorified
[1:09:01] today. Let's just pray together. Our
[1:09:04] gracious heavenly father. Lord, that is
[1:09:06] our prayer
[1:09:08] that in our lives you would be
[1:09:10] glorified.
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] It's no light thing to read in your word
[1:09:20] that we are
[1:09:22] to walk circumspectly.
[1:09:26] Yes, Lord. It's no light thing to be
[1:09:28] told that we're to let our light so
[1:09:31] shine. So shine in the manner that a
[1:09:34] city set on a hill cannot be hid. in a
[1:09:37] manner in which a candle is properly
[1:09:39] placed so that it can be effective to
[1:09:41] those who are in the room. These are no
[1:09:45] light
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:47] things. And Lord, how is it that we
[1:09:50] live a life that is witnessing
[1:09:56] truth? And Lord, we would never
[1:09:59] want to have a pattern of behavior or
[1:10:01] habitual
[1:10:03] conduct that undermines the
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:07] moment. When we would say,
[1:10:10] "Oh, to God that you could just be
[1:10:13] prayed for, that you would believe that
[1:10:15] God's a healer."
[1:10:19] Oh, that we could have that life as it
[1:10:22] says in the scripture. We are the salt
[1:10:24] of the
[1:10:26] earth that would cause others to crave
[1:10:28] you, desire you, see you, know you.
[1:10:34] Lord, I want my life to make a
[1:10:36] difference. I want to live a life that
[1:10:39] is kind. I want to live a life that is
[1:10:40] honest. I want to live a life that is
[1:10:43] sensitive, that is
[1:10:45] upright, not for my own benefit, but for
[1:10:48] your glory, for the benefit of others,
[1:10:51] toward them that are
[1:10:53] without, towards those that profess to
[1:10:56] believe are without the nature of
[1:10:58] Christ. To those who refuse to believe
[1:11:00] and need to believe, to those who are
[1:11:02] without light, without the word, without
[1:11:04] faith. Lord, I want to walk in wisdom
[1:11:06] for the benefit of those who have not
[1:11:08] wisdom.
[1:11:11] And Lord, I want my life to be an
[1:11:13] example. Use words if
[1:11:17] necessary. So help me, Father, to just
[1:11:20] recognize opportunities that I might
[1:11:23] have to make a difference in somebody
[1:11:25] else's
[1:11:26] life. We love you. We ask your blessing
[1:11:29] upon the people today as we are
[1:11:31] dismissed
[1:11:32] shortly. May you be our portion.
[1:11:35] Lord, encourage us where we're
[1:11:37] discouraged.
[1:11:40] Comfort us, Lord, where we're
[1:11:42] hurting. May we have a positive outlook
[1:11:44] on life. Not because we're good enough,
[1:11:47] not because we're lifted up and we want
[1:11:49] to impress others, but because we trust
[1:11:50] in you, Lord. That we have a positive
[1:11:52] outlook for the benefit of others, for
[1:11:54] the benefit of our children, benefit of
[1:11:56] our spouses. Lord, be positive. We love
[1:12:00] you. We ask all this in the name of Lord
[1:12:01] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:03] Amen.
