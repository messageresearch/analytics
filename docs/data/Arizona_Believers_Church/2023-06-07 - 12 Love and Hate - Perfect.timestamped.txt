[0:00] as we read that and as we think about
[0:02] what that scripture means to us even how
[0:04] we've kind of referenced it I think a
[0:06] few times even taking some time to look
[0:07] at how love thy neighbor as thyself is
[0:10] kind of all the law and the prophets
[0:11] hang on that and even as Jesus said it
[0:14] and Paul refers to it that we are to
[0:16] love the Lord thy God with all that we
[0:17] are and with the perfect love and then
[0:19] to love thy neighbors as thyself there's
[0:22] three different loves that are expressed
[0:24] there and uh and to think that in doing
[0:27] that and loving your neighbor as thyself
[0:29] is saying this is the fulfilling of the
[0:32] law there's so much that is emphasized
[0:34] in that and so tonight with the subject
[0:36] of love and hate we're ref what we've
[0:38] been doing is kind of wrestling with the
[0:40] different aspects of perfect love and
[0:42] how it varies from Human love because
[0:44] there's some things that we could say I
[0:45] will love if you love someone you're
[0:47] kind to them if you love someone you're
[0:49] patient with them and there might be
[0:50] attributes of human love or love that
[0:53] can be tainted uh that might seem to be
[0:55] the same attributes of a perfect love or
[0:58] the love that we would have for God but
[1:00] I've been laboring in a way to kind of
[1:02] separate the human love and perfect love
[1:05] or love that is divine and there's been
[1:08] three main themes in this series as
[1:10] we've looked at perfect love there's a
[1:11] knowing God's perfect love for us and
[1:14] then a growing in perfect love for God
[1:16] but then also showing God's perfect love
[1:19] to others I think you've seen that in
[1:20] the what we've expressed as maybe the
[1:22] the horizontal relationships and the
[1:24] vertical relationships that we want to
[1:26] know God's love for us better we want to
[1:28] grow into a more perfect love for God
[1:30] and it just can't end there we want to
[1:32] love one another correctly with the
[1:34] right kind of love
[1:36] and in looking at love and hate I think
[1:38] we're using words that are very familiar
[1:39] to us
[1:40] and we've been pointing out that perfect
[1:43] love may share some similarities with
[1:45] human love but perfect love is always
[1:47] pure and as Paul is saying here in
[1:49] Romans chapter 13 that you cannot love
[1:52] your neighbor and do any evil to your
[1:55] neighbor and in Mana in love in your
[1:57] neighbor and if we just say well I don't
[1:59] know what that looks like and we just
[2:00] admit that there is a perfect love that
[2:02] you could have for your neighbor there's
[2:03] a way that you could love your neighbor
[2:05] according to the scripture
[2:06] and and you'd say that if you could love
[2:08] your neighbor and in doing that whatever
[2:10] that looks like and if we don't know
[2:12] what that looks like we say but we can
[2:13] agree that if we do that we actually
[2:16] fulfill the will of God that we actually
[2:18] fulfill all the law that all the law and
[2:20] the way that it's multifaceted for the
[2:22] Jesus and the writers to say man if you
[2:24] could just get this part down the rest
[2:26] would be easy then it really speaks to
[2:29] me it really speaks to the pure
[2:31] character of perfect love that there's
[2:34] something about the love for God and
[2:37] God's love for us that when it's
[2:39] manifest it's always pure
[2:41] and and loving your neighbor the Bible
[2:44] is telling us you can do no evil to him
[2:46] nor can you commit any evil to God
[2:50] so the Bible does not say love thy
[2:52] neighbor and in loving Thy Neighbor it
[2:54] fulfills the law so whatever you think
[2:56] you need to do to love your neighbor
[2:58] that's going to be the Fulfillment of
[2:59] God's love regardless of what it does to
[3:01] God's word or how it views God's word
[3:03] but in other words if you love your
[3:05] neighbor you can do no evil against your
[3:07] neighbor neither can you commit any
[3:08] transgression in God's word so kind of
[3:11] you cannot offend God's word by loving
[3:14] your neighbor I think as we said last
[3:16] Wednesday the highest form
[3:18] of of Love towards anyone would be
[3:21] manifesting the true nature of the word
[3:23] of God that it's not like well I think
[3:25] the nicest thing I could do to speak
[3:26] their love language and the nicest thing
[3:28] I could do is get them something they
[3:29] like and we think of all these terms and
[3:32] ideologies that maybe we can use uh to
[3:35] express love and to convey things to uh
[3:39] to somebody and we think oh well if I
[3:40] could just if I could just speak in a
[3:42] way that they can understand and I
[3:44] believe that in its most simple basic
[3:46] way the best way the highest form of
[3:48] loving someone is manifesting the true
[3:50] nature of the word and sometimes it
[3:52] takes a lot of breaking down and
[3:54] humility to find how God's nature needs
[3:57] to be expressed to somebody
[3:59] I I this just kind of this thought is
[4:01] bombarding me right now and it's
[4:03] something I've come across a few times
[4:05] but I've actually been revisiting a lot
[4:07] of things that I had been taught Through
[4:08] The Years in terms of parenting and
[4:10] different
[4:11] um ways of parenting your children and
[4:14] and the deeper you get into the word of
[4:15] God sometimes you go back and you look
[4:17] at some of the things you were taught
[4:18] and you cringe a little bit
[4:20] because it doesn't come from the word
[4:21] and it doesn't come from the message of
[4:23] the hour it comes from somebody
[4:25] who maybe never wanted to have kids and
[4:27] hated them right and so they just equip
[4:30] you with a lot of ways to inflict pain
[4:32] upon your children
[4:34] and I and I realized that even and I
[4:36] don't mean any offense to anybody who
[4:38] may subscribe to this Theory but there's
[4:39] this there's some things that just
[4:41] become these our minds just kind of
[4:43] latch onto it says you don't want to
[4:44] become the threatening repeating parent
[4:46] and we say well that that's the true
[4:48] nature of the Devils to be a threatening
[4:50] repeating parent and then the more you
[4:51] read in the Bible you find that God is
[4:53] so long-suffering he comes across as a
[4:55] threatening repeating parent
[4:57] it was I have to reject the nature of
[4:59] God to adopt somebody else's theology in
[5:02] terms of how I need to raise the kid my
[5:03] kids and I realize the best thing I
[5:05] could do for my children is to manifest
[5:07] the nature of God and I find myself
[5:09] praying more and more God give me wisdom
[5:11] to know what's needed in the moment that
[5:14] I find myself in but the highest form of
[5:17] love that we can express is to manifest
[5:19] the word of God
[5:21] now on the subject of of love and hate
[5:23] I'm wanting to look at the relationship
[5:25] between love and hate some may say there
[5:27] is no relationship but at least we can
[5:28] explore that
[5:30] and it may be to find out if there
[5:32] actually is a righteous hate or a true
[5:35] hate
[5:36] and I find that the very things that
[5:38] kind of led me into this area that kept
[5:40] love and hate kept surfacing is I'm kind
[5:42] of aiming to address the ugly side of
[5:45] loving God with the perverted love
[5:48] so that we could take a love for
[5:49] perverted things and we say well that's
[5:51] that's filio and that's worldly love and
[5:53] that's lust and that's that's wrong if
[5:55] that's foul and any love that we say
[5:57] points downward to the Flesh and points
[5:59] downward to Earthly things we say that's
[6:01] a base lover a human love but there's
[6:03] this ugly side of claiming to love God
[6:06] but yet it's a perverted love it's not a
[6:08] perfect love and so there's a real ugly
[6:10] side to that because how easy it is to
[6:12] justify ourselves when that happens
[6:14] but before we go further let me say this
[6:17] we've touched on how that perfect love
[6:19] is loyal to God's will
[6:21] so that it's protective of God's purpose
[6:24] and that loves evidence is centered on
[6:27] uh perfect love being an expression of
[6:29] God's word so there's this idea that
[6:32] when we realize I think we went through
[6:33] different things that God is his word
[6:35] God is love scriptural trait of loving
[6:37] God is obeying his word and so we can
[6:40] kind of develop this real rigid system
[6:42] that if I love God I keep his word if I
[6:44] love God I'm obedient to his word so it
[6:47] it tends to contend to some sort of
[6:49] legalism
[6:50] uh force or intimidation because we we
[6:52] feel like as long as I'm doing his word
[6:54] that's love
[6:57] but our Humanity can easily co-opt uh
[6:59] what we see as attributes of God's word
[7:02] for our own vanity our own Pride our own
[7:05] self-serving uh reasons
[7:09] and I and and maybe that that needs to
[7:12] kind of be the
[7:13] the kicker to start thinking
[7:16] now if you turn to Psalm 139 verses 21
[7:18] and 22
[7:20] I come I arrive at this scripture now as
[7:23] I'm thinking about
[7:25] ways that we view God or his love or the
[7:28] word
[7:29] and it takes on a certain character by
[7:32] our perception like we're seeing it
[7:33] through our own glasses our own lens our
[7:35] own filter
[7:36] and there's a part of it says yeah I
[7:38] like that
[7:39] and we try to use that this veneer of
[7:42] God's love really to serve ourselves and
[7:44] to serve some other emotional agenda
[7:46] that's very far from the love of God
[7:49] and David says and I know you all can
[7:51] just repeat this by heart without even
[7:52] looking it up do not I hate them O Lord
[7:54] that hate thee and am I not grieved with
[7:56] those that rise up against thee and the
[7:58] church said I hate them with perfect
[8:00] hatred I count them my enemies I'm sure
[8:03] you all have thought about this
[8:04] scripture in terms of love and hate but
[8:07] he says I hate them with perfect hatred
[8:10] I count them mine enemies
[8:13] do I not hate them that hate thee and it
[8:15] this seems to be uh if you put it that
[8:18] way you could find yourself kind of
[8:19] going
[8:20] yeah I mean if somebody hates God I mean
[8:22] I'll just take them right back and I and
[8:25] there's this feeling that maybe that
[8:26] this has some sort of we have some sort
[8:28] of affinity to it without having to
[8:30] rationalize very much if you knew
[8:32] somebody hated your children you might
[8:33] just instinctively say why I oughta
[8:35] right it's just it's just natural if
[8:37] somebody hates someone you love it
[8:39] creates that adversary relationship that
[8:41] the enmity is there uh just by virtue of
[8:43] those different extremes and your love
[8:45] for the object he says I hate them with
[8:47] perfect hatred I count them mine enemies
[8:49] and I wonder just how easily maybe even
[8:52] just based upon a scripture like this
[8:54] how easily do we justify hate when
[8:56] someone disagrees with us or offends us
[8:59] like if someone says you know oh I don't
[9:01] believe like you or somebody says
[9:03] something to offend you or somebody does
[9:04] anything happens like just in this realm
[9:06] to where some sort of sensitivity of
[9:08] ours or some like or dislike is offended
[9:10] by somebody else how easily is it for us
[9:13] to hate them or Justify our hatred based
[9:16] upon description
[9:18] in other words we
[9:20] we Harbor hate that is an evil but yet
[9:22] we say we we hate them because it's
[9:24] against God's word
[9:26] as I was studying this I found that some
[9:29] people note
[9:30] um they paid attention to the fact that
[9:32] this is being written in the Old
[9:33] Testament and there's this sense of my
[9:36] look at the difference between a Jew who
[9:38] doesn't have the Holy Spirit and the
[9:39] nature of a Christian and what what a
[9:42] vast difference in temperaments what a
[9:44] vast difference in desire and as I read
[9:46] through the book of Psalms a lot of the
[9:48] Psalms this past week and reading
[9:49] through a lot of these different
[9:50] scriptures you find where there's a lot
[9:52] of things in the Old Testament that kind
[9:54] of have that edge and that lack of
[9:55] Greece and that cutting and that tearing
[9:57] down and you can certainly see that
[9:59] there's a different nature under the law
[10:01] a different nature under the Old
[10:02] Testament and certainly a Christian
[10:04] would have a different nature than those
[10:06] of The Unborn again Jew but I asked
[10:09] could there be a perfect hatred
[10:11] because he says I hate them and I hate
[10:13] those that hate thee but then he says
[10:14] you know what let me just put it this
[10:16] way I don't just hate them I hate them
[10:18] with the perfect hatred
[10:20] and I wonder and I'm kind of
[10:24] I'm not just wondering this and then for
[10:26] the rest of the service I'm just going
[10:27] to kind of like spitballing I don't know
[10:28] you know help me out here so we try to
[10:30] figure this out I mean I'm I'm saying
[10:32] this maybe to prompt some thinking but
[10:34] there is could there be a perfect hatred
[10:38] that not just a hate but a perfect hate
[10:42] if there is a faith and a perfect faith
[10:44] if there is a love and a perfect love
[10:46] could there be and in some realm some
[10:49] way could there be a perfect hatred
[10:52] the word that David uses here the
[10:54] psalmist uses
[10:55] is perfect it means the end or the
[10:57] consummation completion completeness and
[11:00] it comes from the root to accomplish or
[11:02] fulfill
[11:03] and so we're thinking again I hope
[11:05] you're thinking of because you remember
[11:06] perfectly with perfect recall Parts one
[11:08] through eleven and where we defined
[11:11] perfect love and it's When Love is
[11:14] perfected it fulfills its goal it
[11:15] fulfills its objective and so there's
[11:18] some sense of purpose some sort of sense
[11:20] of accomplishment so he says when I hate
[11:22] them with the perfect hatred in other
[11:24] words this hate has found its intended
[11:26] target
[11:27] it's fulfilled its purpose it
[11:29] accomplishes what it ought David if I
[11:33] could put it this way the psalmist or
[11:34] whether it's be David who wrote it
[11:37] um there's a psalm for David that it
[11:39] says well I just don't have a hate it's
[11:41] not just directed towards you know I
[11:42] hate oysters all right you know I I I
[11:45] hate the Diamondbacks or something like
[11:46] that but he's saying you know what in
[11:48] all the things I've hated throughout my
[11:49] life I finally have found the right uh
[11:52] Target of this kind of hate like if
[11:54] there's going to be some sort of animus
[11:56] is there going to be some sort of
[11:57] bitterness and hostility surely it could
[12:00] be towards this and and maybe bring in
[12:02] those other words into view could Cloud
[12:04] the picture a little bit but he's saying
[12:05] I I found
[12:07] I hate that is centered correctly
[12:12] could that be what he's saying is what
[12:13] I'm proposing
[12:15] and what I propose is there must be a
[12:17] Godly hatred
[12:19] there must be a hatred that is perfect
[12:21] that's pure that produces righteousness
[12:24] because the Bible speaks too often
[12:27] of a hate that originates within God
[12:30] and before we take a step further in
[12:33] looking at Godly hatred let's look at
[12:34] Second Corinthians 11 2.
[12:37] Paul says for I am jealous over you with
[12:40] a with Godly jealousy for I have a
[12:43] spouse you to one husband that I may
[12:44] present you as a chaste of Virgin to
[12:45] Christ and so I think it's his objective
[12:47] and his goal uh
[12:50] he's bringing into mind the type of
[12:52] zealousness that a friend of a
[12:54] bridegroom would have the kind of
[12:56] zealous a man would have over someone
[12:57] he's protecting for his friend or for
[12:59] his wife his uh the wife of a man of her
[13:02] husband
[13:03] and he says I am jealous over you with
[13:06] The Godly jealousy Godly jealousy
[13:08] implies that that maybe there's there's
[13:10] a way that we might think of jealousy
[13:12] and say well that that's that's Carnival
[13:14] he says this is a Godly jealousy you
[13:15] know this is a jealousy that that has
[13:18] God's honor at heart
[13:20] as I have espoused you to one husband uh
[13:23] my loyalty in my Zeal isn't for myself
[13:25] but it's to Christ that this is a
[13:28] zealous this is a Godly jealousy this
[13:30] isn't for my own vanity my own Pride but
[13:32] this is literally a Zeal for God and and
[13:34] I'm jealous over you not to honor my
[13:37] Ministry or myself but as a a Zeal that
[13:40] has God's honor in Christ's honor at
[13:43] heart
[13:44] the word zeal is this word jealous this
[13:46] comes from to desire to earnestly pursue
[13:50] it's translated to covet and envy
[13:52] and so for Paul to say there's a Godly
[13:54] jealousy there's there's some Pursuit
[13:57] and there's some something that you
[13:58] place above everything else that you
[14:00] covet that you can envy that can be in
[14:02] the category of a righteous desire or
[14:04] Godly Pursuit
[14:06] but it also means to be heated or to
[14:08] boil With Envy hatred and anger
[14:11] and we all know that there is a selfish
[14:13] jealousy which is cruel
[14:15] which is manipulative which is a
[14:18] condemning or controlling
[14:19] which is abusive and this is a this is a
[14:22] jealousy that often arises within the
[14:24] context of Human Relationships where
[14:26] where one has a love for the other maybe
[14:28] two people have a love for each other
[14:30] and if there's any kind of fear or or
[14:32] immaturity in that love jealousy can be
[14:34] one of those things that creep into it
[14:35] and it becomes very very possessive
[14:37] and I trust that none of you have
[14:39] experienced these things being raised in
[14:41] Godly homes and having good
[14:43] relationships and hopefully uh finding
[14:45] yourself whether courting godly people
[14:47] and ultimately marrying a Godly spouse
[14:49] that you haven't experienced this but
[14:50] for anybody who's spent any time in the
[14:52] world or has had a relationship that's a
[14:54] little bit broken jealousy is a nasty
[14:57] thing
[14:59] there there could be no trust when
[15:02] you're out of one another's presence
[15:03] there's this possessiveness of who are
[15:05] you calling who are you texting what are
[15:07] you doing and and and and all these
[15:10] things and barriers that are constructed
[15:12] to keep you uh under their control or
[15:15] within their view it's a very very nasty
[15:17] thing and so maybe there's ways that we
[15:19] can all relate to a jealousy that's
[15:21] manipulative controlling that's abusive
[15:24] we know there's a selfish selfish hatred
[15:26] which is spiteful it's mean
[15:28] it's destructive it's condemning
[15:31] yet the Bible says there's a Godly
[15:33] jealousy
[15:35] and there being a Godly jealousy I want
[15:37] to say that there's a Godly hate
[15:40] and I believe there's a Godly jealousy
[15:41] and a Godly hate that is an expression
[15:43] of perfect love
[15:46] I like the quietness it means you're
[15:48] listening
[15:50] and maybe you're saying I sure hope
[15:51] there's not a part two because we better
[15:52] get to the end of this
[15:55] in Exodus chapter 20 verses 5 and 6 it
[15:58] says Thou shalt not bow down thyself to
[16:00] them nor serve them for I the Lord thy
[16:03] God am a jealous God Paul was in a very
[16:06] safe place when he said that he
[16:08] was coveted and envied with a Godly
[16:11] jealousy to honor Christ and to present
[16:14] the bride or this this engaged one that
[16:18] he may present to as a Chase of urgent
[16:19] to Christ because God himself says I the
[16:21] Lord God am a jealous God and then as a
[16:24] result of this jealousy I hope you can
[16:25] see this next step visiting the iniquity
[16:27] of the fathers upon the children upon
[16:29] the third and fourth generation of them
[16:30] that hate me
[16:32] and showing Mercy unto thou unto
[16:34] thousands of them that love me and keep
[16:36] my Commandments
[16:38] he says I am a god that is a jealous God
[16:41] and the very next two characteristics
[16:43] that he expresses is Love and Hate
[16:45] that being a jealous God it was it's
[16:47] necessary for him to have some love and
[16:49] it's necessary for him to have some hate
[16:51] says I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[16:54] and I will visit what they do what is
[16:56] due upon them that hate me but I'll show
[16:58] Mercy unto thousands of them that love
[17:00] me and keep my Commandments because
[17:02] they're one in the same
[17:04] says in Exodus 34 14 this is even more
[17:06] pronounced and more clear for Thou shalt
[17:08] worship no other God we know the Bible
[17:10] says there are no other gods beside me
[17:13] and this is mentioned in this context I
[17:15] think it's important that we recognize
[17:17] this for Thou shalt worship no other God
[17:19] for the Lord whose name is jealous is a
[17:22] jealous God
[17:23] so actually names himself jealous
[17:27] we know that God is love
[17:30] though he does not name himself as love
[17:32] here he is named as jealous and the Lord
[17:35] is a jealous God his name is jealous
[17:40] but notice how it says thou shall not
[17:41] worship any other God
[17:44] and and so he's saying let me explain
[17:46] this to you you cannot deify anyone else
[17:49] you cannot give honor and glory and
[17:51] praise and worship to anyone else
[17:52] because I I Am the Only God and there is
[17:56] no other God beside me there's only one
[17:59] God and therefore there can only be one
[18:02] loyalty and one love to one God
[18:05] there could be no other worship worship
[18:07] isn't due anywhere else there's only one
[18:09] God is there anything else you want to
[18:11] worship
[18:12] would we ever worship William random
[18:15] would we ever worship creation
[18:17] would we ever find ourselves worshiping
[18:19] the things that God loves and God honors
[18:22] no we we could not do that
[18:24] that love is only due to God he's one
[18:27] God therefore it's a jealous God because
[18:29] that love can only come to one
[18:33] there's only one God Thou shalt worship
[18:36] no other God for the Lord whose name is
[18:38] jealous is a jealous God
[18:40] so I know that maybe to this point some
[18:43] of these things are making sense to you
[18:44] but it might just be a little bit of
[18:45] rough patch there as we talk about love
[18:47] and hate and they're being a perfect
[18:48] hatred and maybe a Godly hatred
[18:51] and I will say this acknowledging the
[18:53] paradox
[18:54] love cannot exist without hate
[18:58] if it's if it's merely just the law of
[19:01] contrast I think that would be enough to
[19:03] satisfy
[19:04] but let me take it a step further and
[19:05] say perfect love cannot exist without
[19:07] perfect hate
[19:10] perfect love cannot exist without
[19:12] perfect hate
[19:14] in Deuteronomy chapter 7 verses 7 to 10
[19:16] I'm going to read this
[19:18] and again it's really it's like an unto
[19:20] Exodus 20 where he says I'm a jealous
[19:22] God
[19:23] and so I'll punish those that hate me
[19:24] and I'll have mercy to those that love
[19:26] me
[19:27] he says in Deuteronomy 7 7-10 the Lord
[19:30] did not set his love upon you
[19:33] nor choose you because you were more in
[19:35] number than any people
[19:37] for you were the fewest of all people
[19:40] a full church does not indicate God's
[19:42] love or blessing
[19:44] he says but because the Lord loved you
[19:46] and because he would keep the oath which
[19:48] he had sworn unto your father's hath the
[19:51] Lord brought you out with the mighty
[19:52] hand and redeemed you out of the house
[19:53] of bondman for the hand from the hand of
[19:56] pharaoh king of Egypt so it's his love
[19:59] he said this is the love I have for you
[20:00] no therefore the Lord thy God he is God
[20:02] he's his name is jealous he's a jealous
[20:05] God but he's the faithful God which
[20:07] keepeth Covenant and mercy with them
[20:09] that love him and keep his Commandments
[20:11] to a thousand Generations
[20:14] so notice how he's talking about his
[20:16] love there's dozens of places I could
[20:18] use tonight I know you're already
[20:19] thinking of all these different places
[20:20] we could use from the Old Testament
[20:22] where God talks about the love he has
[20:24] for Israel the love he has for his elect
[20:25] and so now as God has talked up I love
[20:27] you I chose you not because you were
[20:29] great not because you were Mighty but I
[20:31] chose you in a situation where you were
[20:32] clearly the oppressed and you were the
[20:34] victim and you were little and you were
[20:36] small and you were powerless and I love
[20:38] you and I'm going to keep my Covenant
[20:39] I'm going to I I I'm gonna could by
[20:42] whatever I swore to you I will fulfill
[20:44] it so now that his love is clearly in
[20:46] the air and everyone's feeling his love
[20:48] he says and repayeth them that hate him
[20:51] to their face to destroy them
[20:54] he will not be slacked to him that
[20:57] hateth him he will repay him to his face
[21:03] this is uh this this escalated quickly
[21:06] like we're just over here feeling all
[21:08] yeah yeah oh he loves us isn't this
[21:10] great and God is love and also and you
[21:13] right
[21:15] you're like all right
[21:17] he says I I'm gonna punish you I'll
[21:19] repay them that hate him to his face
[21:21] and and it's like he'll not be he's not
[21:24] gonna be Slack
[21:26] those that hate him he'll repay
[21:29] it's gonna it's gonna be obvious it's
[21:32] going to be a clear rebuke
[21:35] but why
[21:37] why would why would this the Lord did
[21:39] not set his love upon you because you
[21:40] were great and you were Mighty and he
[21:42] loves you and he's going to keep his
[21:43] promises and it's love love love love
[21:44] and then all sudden and anybody that
[21:47] hates God he's going to repay him to
[21:48] their face why because of his love
[21:55] should we start all over
[21:57] I think we got plenty I'm looking out
[21:58] across the audience I got after hour
[22:00] people with me tonight
[22:02] so I'm not afraid to go long but if you
[22:05] if you if you'll help me a lot tonight
[22:06] if you're catching it and at least say
[22:09] okay right because that indicates you're
[22:11] like all right I'm with you to that
[22:12] point you have to say Amen but you're
[22:13] like okay
[22:15] or you could even go huh
[22:17] I mean at least I know that you're like
[22:19] wrestling with him
[22:21] and watch it not too many huh
[22:24] or I'll repay you to your face
[22:29] the very reason why God verse 10 this is
[22:33] how this is how I feel to express it so
[22:35] you can understand if God says I love
[22:38] you and I love you and I love you and I
[22:40] love you and then there's somebody over
[22:41] there going and I hate God that loves
[22:43] you
[22:44] and God says oh and him too
[22:46] we'd all be like and and whatever
[22:49] happens I know this is maybe a crude
[22:50] example but it's like whatever his love
[22:52] for you does it works for this guy over
[22:54] here we'd be like well in the end I mean
[22:57] what good I mean what kind of love is it
[22:59] I know this is this is real carnal the
[23:01] way I'm trying to describe it but it's
[23:02] kind of like the ax murderer is in
[23:03] heaven right
[23:06] and it begs the question well what good
[23:09] is election
[23:10] what good is love what good is the cross
[23:12] if God's love is just kind of like well
[23:14] I know I said I love you and if you keep
[23:16] my Commandments I'll do all sorts of
[23:17] special things for you but I just can't
[23:19] find it in me to punish this guy who
[23:20] hates me
[23:22] so I and I'm putting it very Elementary
[23:24] maybe two over simplistic terms to
[23:27] recognize it's because he does love
[23:31] that it almost requires that he hates
[23:37] and so in Proverbs Chapter 6 verses 16
[23:39] to 19 how many have already thought of
[23:41] this tonight these six things death the
[23:43] Lord hate
[23:44] so hatred is some sort of characteristic
[23:47] of God
[23:49] it is if I could say that it has
[23:52] that
[23:54] God helped me to find the right words to
[23:56] express it it's not that it it has
[23:59] Genesis purely in God of its own
[24:03] but it exists as an opposite to love
[24:07] and these six things death the Lord hate
[24:09] yay seven are an Abomination unto him so
[24:11] as we think as we read this invert
[24:14] it says a proud look
[24:17] a lying tongue
[24:19] hands that shed innocent blood and heart
[24:21] that divides with Wicked imaginations
[24:23] feet that are that be swift to run into
[24:26] mischief
[24:27] and so as we read these and it's kind of
[24:30] always remarkable that I mean he's
[24:31] writing he says there's six things God
[24:33] hates he's like no wait seven like he
[24:35] couldn't just
[24:36] couldn't just like line it out and write
[24:38] it write it out seven but
[24:40] these six things that the Lord hate yay
[24:43] seven are an Abomination unto him
[24:46] and a proud look a lying tongue hands
[24:48] that shed innocent blood a heart that
[24:50] devises we can imagine there's a feat
[24:51] that be swift to running to mischief and
[24:52] we think oh okay well maybe it's the
[24:55] proud look so we could change our look
[24:57] it's the it's the lying tongue so we
[24:59] could change our tongue or we could the
[25:00] hands and we think of like just these
[25:02] different parts and so maybe we're we're
[25:05] cutting we're dividing uh weaknesses in
[25:07] an individual but then he says a false
[25:09] witness that speaketh lies and now it's
[25:12] really hard to separate out which part
[25:13] we're talking about
[25:15] and then if it gets if you feel like
[25:17] there's still some wiggle room and he
[25:19] that soweth Discord among the among
[25:21] brethren so it's not just a look it's
[25:24] not just a tongue it's not just hands
[25:25] it's not just the heart it's not just
[25:27] feed it's not just a false witness but
[25:29] it's the person
[25:31] these six things I mean seven things
[25:33] that God hates
[25:35] that are an abomination
[25:37] the Abomination is something
[25:40] that God detests
[25:43] that's why when we read in the Bible
[25:45] there's a lot of things in the in the
[25:46] Bible that God gives the children of
[25:47] Israel as a law and it's a law this is
[25:49] this is something critical to understand
[25:51] and maybe to ponder he gives it to the
[25:53] children of Israel as a law to govern
[25:54] their human nature so God's given it to
[25:57] them as protective of nature given the
[25:59] fall but then there's other things that
[26:01] are reflective of God's on God's perfect
[26:04] nature and those things are an
[26:07] Abomination regardless of man's
[26:09] condition so when he says that it's an
[26:11] Abomination for a woman to wear a
[26:12] garment that pertaineth to a man and
[26:14] then he says but you better not Square
[26:16] you have to cut your beard this way or
[26:17] you better not mix your cotton with your
[26:19] linen you may say well this is in the
[26:20] law and this is in the law well God
[26:22] didn't say it's an Abomination to wear
[26:23] linen pants and a silk shirt I don't
[26:26] think he did but but there's certain
[26:29] things that maybe we place in this
[26:31] category that God give this prescription
[26:33] against it but then there's other things
[26:34] he says I don't care if you're Old
[26:36] Testament New Testament I despise it I
[26:38] hate it
[26:39] because it speaks to the character of
[26:41] God and as we read this it's not that
[26:43] God just hates the proud look and a
[26:45] lying tongue hands that shed innocent
[26:46] blood in the hearts of devise is wicked
[26:48] and feet that are Swift Swift and
[26:49] mischief and false Witnesses speak lies
[26:51] and he that so this chord it's he
[26:53] detests these things and hates these
[26:54] things because of the things he loves
[26:57] that's each one of these is against his
[27:00] nature and his character that's why when
[27:02] Paul says hey if you just won't kill and
[27:04] you won't steal and you won't do this
[27:05] and it begins to list all these uh
[27:07] different Commandments in the scripture
[27:08] and says and if there's any other ones
[27:10] they're all summarized in this one thing
[27:12] to love thy neighbor as thyself in other
[27:14] words the things that God hates are
[27:16] against the things that God loves
[27:19] amen therefore there is he says that he
[27:22] hates them
[27:24] now
[27:26] you cannot truly love God and this is I
[27:29] think this is where it gets um
[27:32] uh you have to get real
[27:35] this is I I I hope that what's happening
[27:38] is as we said there's this ugly side of
[27:40] loving God of having the perverted love
[27:42] towards God
[27:43] that we try to take these things that
[27:45] are Godly hate Godly jealousy so try to
[27:48] pull into this other realm now there
[27:51] should be a separation but the things
[27:52] I'm getting ready to read is where
[27:54] people start conflating their own
[27:56] personal agendas
[27:58] with the spirit and nature of God and
[28:01] it's a false love
[28:03] because you cannot truly love God or his
[28:05] word
[28:06] without the consequence of hating the
[28:08] opposite
[28:11] I hope that satisfies in the way I
[28:13] phrase it took some time to try to find
[28:15] just an exact a right way to convey that
[28:20] um I find with with the gift that God
[28:22] has given me I admire the Ministries
[28:25] that are much different much greater
[28:26] much more charismatic I find that God
[28:29] deals with me
[28:30] in uh in getting myself out of the way
[28:32] long before I get behind this desk
[28:34] to try to find the mind of God than just
[28:37] getting up here with the phrase love and
[28:38] hate and just kind of trying to explore
[28:40] it a little bit and by inspiration come
[28:42] up with ideas to share with you on that
[28:44] and so sometimes there's very specific
[28:46] things I feel to say to convey it and we
[28:49] cannot love God without the consequence
[28:51] of hating the opposite of God
[28:53] notice this and I'll just use Psalm 119
[28:55] as an example there's three different
[28:57] places there's more that I could have
[28:58] used even from Psalm 119 but I felt like
[29:01] this that this conveyed
[29:02] conveyed some of these things well
[29:06] I don't know why I'm
[29:08] DJing up here so much
[29:13] verse 104 through thy precepts I get
[29:16] understanding
[29:17] now if we look at this as our beginning
[29:19] place to say that the more he
[29:21] understands about the word therefore I
[29:23] hate every false way
[29:25] so as his love for the things of God
[29:28] grew as his knowledge of the word of God
[29:30] grew as he gets understanding through
[29:33] the word he hates every false way
[29:36] now it's he could not say that man I'm
[29:38] getting all this understanding with more
[29:40] understanding I find it easier to
[29:42] compromise I find it easier to accept
[29:44] things that are against God he said no
[29:45] the more I know about you the more I
[29:48] hate every false way verse 113 I hate
[29:51] vain thoughts but thy law do I love so
[29:53] now notice the balance to each I hate I
[29:56] hate in a poor line but thy law do I
[29:59] love
[30:00] so just in these verses alone and
[30:02] there's many other places I am Telling
[30:04] You many other places we could show this
[30:06] these opposites and they how they're
[30:08] working where there's this love for God
[30:09] there's a hatred for things that are not
[30:11] God or against God
[30:12] and so there is this I look at it as
[30:15] sort of this balancing
[30:17] that as you love God
[30:20] that there's there's this it spreads out
[30:24] that the more Your Love Grows for him
[30:25] the the more things in essence that it
[30:29] places in its proper perspective that
[30:31] you view correctly and the things that
[30:34] seem to be further away from him or if
[30:36] God reveals to you one thing the thing
[30:38] that is against that or anti that it
[30:40] changes its tenor when God reveals to
[30:42] you baptism in the name Lord Jesus
[30:44] Christ then baptism and titles changes
[30:46] its character and so as God reveals
[30:49] himself as Christ reveals himself you
[30:52] you see the Antichrist as against the
[30:54] things that you love and so if I could
[30:58] just get scientific
[30:59] for every action there's an equal and
[31:02] opposite reaction
[31:03] so it's not that I've got to go right
[31:06] but in that in my love to Christ creates
[31:10] the opposite uh thrust against the
[31:14] things that are against Christ
[31:16] and so perfect love and perfect hatred
[31:20] are the perfect harmony of God's
[31:22] character
[31:24] it's a balancing act God it couldn't it
[31:27] couldn't be perfect love he couldn't be
[31:29] all love if he didn't have this other
[31:30] dimension of hate
[31:32] it has to be it must be this way even in
[31:36] a prophecy of Christ Psalms 45 7 thou
[31:39] love this righteousness and hadest
[31:41] wickedness
[31:43] remember how Paul I I read I quote the
[31:45] scripture so often I've I think I've
[31:47] actually banned it from being in this
[31:49] series even though it's probably too
[31:50] late but uh Let Your Love be without
[31:52] dissimulation without hypocrisy abhor
[31:54] that which is evil plead to that which
[31:56] is good love requires a discernment
[31:59] of what is Godly what is ungodly and
[32:02] then not just a discernment to say well
[32:04] I know ones of God and one's not but I
[32:06] love them both
[32:07] right I can just I just no I shouldn't
[32:10] hate but no there has to be an
[32:12] abhorrence a detesting a rejecting of
[32:14] that which is evil it says you love
[32:17] righteousness and hate wickedness
[32:18] therefore God thy God hath anointed thee
[32:21] with oil of gladness above thy fellows
[32:24] this is this is the heart of God this is
[32:26] something that pleases God is Not Just
[32:28] To Love good things but also to hate the
[32:30] anti-good
[32:32] if I can say it his love requires hatred
[32:35] through thy precepts I get understanding
[32:37] the more I understand I get the more I
[32:38] hate things that are wrong I hate vain
[32:40] thoughts I hate in a poor line but the
[32:42] law I love you know it's the hate that
[32:45] he has for the vain thoughts the lying
[32:47] the false way the wickedness
[32:51] is not mentioned depart apart from a
[32:53] love for understanding the law in
[32:56] righteousness
[32:58] so love requires hatred
[33:01] but not as a product
[33:04] not as the ultimate not as a a priority
[33:07] only as a consequence
[33:10] I only have hate because of how much I
[33:13] love
[33:14] now let me just drop back and say I say
[33:17] this for the grace that we can have in
[33:18] our own relationships that's the reason
[33:20] why our relationships whether it be a
[33:22] spouse or to children have such
[33:24] intensity
[33:27] you know what I'm talking about because
[33:29] of love
[33:31] that's what creates it two people don't
[33:32] care they're never going to argue
[33:34] right there's not real feelings if
[33:36] there's not something in there that
[33:37] hurts if there's not something in there
[33:38] that feels then it's kind of yeah well
[33:40] whatever I don't even think they're I
[33:41] don't even like them right
[33:44] there's just no will to fight there's no
[33:46] will to work I think I've talked about
[33:47] this before that you know love is what
[33:49] Rises up in the moment sometimes it
[33:50] doesn't say what it should and sometimes
[33:52] it goes sometimes it acts in extreme
[33:54] ways and sometimes it raises its voice
[33:56] and sometimes it gets really really hurt
[33:58] and a lot of other emotions spill in
[34:00] when this damn burst but you know at the
[34:01] end of the day there could be some
[34:03] stepping back and say you know what
[34:05] this may not make a lot of sense but
[34:06] that's a good sign
[34:09] it's a good sign
[34:11] and and I've said this I know I've said
[34:13] this before that when we love somebody
[34:15] that we open ourselves up to the to a uh
[34:19] an equal capacity to be hurt by them
[34:24] and so love hatred exists as a
[34:27] consequence of the law not a product of
[34:29] it necessarily but as a balance a
[34:32] consequence of it
[34:34] and so
[34:36] as we press along further in this very
[34:38] simple thought this evening
[34:41] as we hearken back to what David said
[34:43] about his perfect hatred
[34:45] and another whether you want to take
[34:48] into consideration all these things that
[34:50] we've already mentioned that can are
[34:52] hated in the scripture
[34:53] perfect hatred for an enemy or for
[34:55] somebody else if you want to say there
[34:56] is a perfect hatred
[34:58] and it is towards an object maybe we
[35:00] could say an enemy it exists only in
[35:03] light of a perfect love for God
[35:06] so if I'm saying that hatred is a
[35:09] consequence of loving
[35:11] then perfect hatred can only exist if
[35:14] there's actually perfect love
[35:16] so that means there has to be a loved a
[35:19] lover a loved a love that's being
[35:21] projected and then by consequence a
[35:24] hatred
[35:25] does that make sense
[35:26] that you just can't say that well I mean
[35:29] I I hate infidels and I and I hate
[35:31] homosexuals and I hate Democrats and and
[35:33] I hate people I want to take away our
[35:35] guns and I hate Target and what else do
[35:37] we hate
[35:38] and you have this this energy to hate
[35:42] things and it's like all right
[35:45] and it gets like the mob mentality and
[35:47] you have all this hatred it says all
[35:49] right so what is it you love
[35:54] as you hate Starbucks so much what is it
[35:57] besides Bad Coffee
[36:00] and I'm like oh I never thought about it
[36:02] I'm like maybe you might want to say and
[36:05] stop saying you hate
[36:08] because it's a word that we easily we
[36:10] throw out there quite a bit
[36:12] but there's a hate that is base that is
[36:15] foul that is perverted that is
[36:16] destructive that is harmful that is
[36:19] painful just as that jealousy these
[36:21] jealousy and hate which is it is selfish
[36:23] and it seeks to destroy others to
[36:26] condemn them to shame them and it's this
[36:29] Genesis of this hate that arises from
[36:31] human emotion alone
[36:33] but then this hatred perfect hatred
[36:35] it only exists because there's a
[36:37] counterweight to it
[36:39] Called Love
[36:42] you know it can only go so far
[36:44] because love
[36:46] brother Banner makes this makes the
[36:48] statement I think I quoted it last
[36:49] Wednesday any person any church any
[36:50] organization any individual that reasons
[36:54] against one punctuation of God's word is
[36:58] your enemy
[37:02] and a lot of people say
[37:06] right they love that
[37:09] they like to think just one punctuation
[37:11] buddy your spiritual grammar is off I
[37:14] hate you
[37:15] right you got the calm in the wrong
[37:18] place
[37:19] and that's how they feel about it man if
[37:22] they haven't if they if they don't
[37:23] believe it like this if they don't have
[37:24] it like that there's this this animosity
[37:27] this bitterness it's hostility
[37:29] that they have against people because
[37:31] brother bam says it any person any
[37:33] church any organization any individual
[37:34] that reasons that gets one punctuation
[37:35] of God's word is your enemy and I say
[37:37] Amen
[37:40] but then I find that Jesus says in Luke
[37:42] 6 27 but I say unto you which here not
[37:44] everybody hears love your enemies do
[37:47] good to them which hate you
[37:50] and so it I mean it really does beg the
[37:52] question why it says in Deuteronomy 7 10
[37:54] and repayeth them that hate him to their
[37:56] face
[37:57] to destroy them he will not be slacked
[37:59] to him that hateth him he'll repay him
[38:00] to his face
[38:02] and yet we're told to love our enemies
[38:04] and do good to them which hate us
[38:07] can I express it in a way that's maybe
[38:09] more paradoxical than saying that love
[38:11] cannot exist without hate but we're to
[38:13] both love and hate anything that's
[38:14] against God
[38:16] um
[38:18] we're to both love and hate
[38:20] anything that's against God
[38:22] but only because our love is first to
[38:25] God
[38:28] let me give you an example
[38:30] and I know that I'm not running out of
[38:31] time this evening
[38:33] but I intentionally had just very uh
[38:36] succinct thought to express to you
[38:39] and so I mean really as hard as it's up
[38:42] to you how early you make it to Culver's
[38:45] by how hard you pull and how responsive
[38:48] you are and how much we feel that we've
[38:49] we've hit the mark
[38:51] but let's use the example of Jonah
[38:55] so Jonah is told to go to Nineveh and to
[39:00] to preach this uh you know condemning
[39:02] this Army's Pole to go and preach and
[39:04] tell them to repent
[39:05] Jonah has and then the the those at
[39:09] Nineveh they're Arch enemies there's
[39:12] these are Fierce People these are people
[39:13] that it's not like Jonah said oh a
[39:15] chance to go visit family and I've
[39:17] always wanted to go see Nineveh it it
[39:19] was one of these things where it's like
[39:20] nah I don't care for him I hate him
[39:21] don't like them let them sin because at
[39:24] least they get what they deserve and God
[39:26] help us if we've ever thought oh I sure
[39:28] hope they don't ever come to the message
[39:29] because I hope it's really hot in Hell
[39:30] whenever they get there but this is how
[39:33] Jonah feels about it Jonah's kind of
[39:34] like hey I don't want to go he runs he
[39:36] finally gives in and even here in a
[39:38] moment we'll see in a slide where John
[39:40] is basically I knew this was going to
[39:41] happen but Jonah and uh
[39:44] chapter 3 says he calls and he says
[39:47] we're not quite there yet but he says
[39:48] yet 40 days
[39:51] and none of us shall be overthrown
[39:54] so there's maybe he's already kind of
[39:56] started he flipped over this gigantic
[39:58] Sandile 40-day Sandile Sun you know
[40:00] Ascend uh what is it called
[40:03] hourglass a 40 a 40 day glass
[40:07] tips this keg over and he's like look
[40:10] when this thing gets to the bottom
[40:12] Nineveh is going to be destroyed and
[40:14] he's kind of like 40 days and you guys
[40:17] are gonna get it
[40:20] right and he's done right he's happy
[40:23] he's delivered the message he feels good
[40:25] and then wait a minute wait a minute
[40:26] what the king repents
[40:29] they can't tell her sackcloth and Ashes
[40:31] this has been a voice this is a voice
[40:32] from God we need to correct ourselves
[40:34] we've done something wrong oh perv
[40:37] Venture that we we let's let's repent
[40:39] let's repent let repent and the whole
[40:41] city does exactly what Jonah's message
[40:43] was to do is they all repent
[40:47] and you would think that Jonah would be
[40:49] like
[40:51] this is wonderful
[40:53] what a Revival
[40:55] what a what a repenting
[40:58] what a purging what a cleansing
[41:00] I had several lengthy scripture readings
[41:02] to bring to you where where Paul in
[41:04] second Corinthians writes back to the
[41:06] Corinthians he says you know what I
[41:07] wasn't happy that I made you sorry but I
[41:09] mean I was happy I made you in a Godly
[41:11] sort you could tell that Paul is saying
[41:12] it wasn't easy for me to write that
[41:14] letter
[41:15] I want to call things out I didn't want
[41:16] to break that brother I didn't want to
[41:18] expose that sister I didn't this wasn't
[41:20] easy to me and I'm so happy you repented
[41:22] oh what Zeal what cleansing see this is
[41:26] what that was any and he's explaining
[41:28] himself in such a way to say this is why
[41:29] sometimes love is cutting this is why
[41:31] Love sometimes is very hard and why it
[41:33] has to do what it does but this didn't
[41:35] come easy to me
[41:37] and Paul's rejoicing in the repentance
[41:39] Paul's not saying man I thought for sure
[41:41] I'd get rid of that guy
[41:43] hey I thought for sure they dig his
[41:45] Hills in and he refused to repent and
[41:47] I'd get rid of him my adversary this
[41:49] enemy but no he comes back and here
[41:50] Jonah the king does exactly uh what
[41:53] Jonah says he must do and he repents and
[41:56] then
[41:57] it says in verse 10 and God solved their
[41:59] works
[42:00] that they turned from their evil way and
[42:02] God repented of the evil
[42:05] that he said that he would do unto them
[42:07] and he did it not
[42:09] wow
[42:11] God's like oh man never mind
[42:14] and this is something that's obviously
[42:16] conveyed to Jonah
[42:18] and as you read the in your Bible you
[42:20] know chapter 3 is going to end but let's
[42:22] just remove the chapters and it says and
[42:24] and God repented of the evil that he
[42:27] said that he would do to unto them and
[42:29] he did it not but it displeased Jonah
[42:31] exceedingly and he was very angry
[42:38] so God God acts Jonah says if you guys
[42:41] don't repent you're going to get it to
[42:42] your face right and leaves and they
[42:45] repent like we don't want it we don't
[42:47] want it in 40 days and God says you know
[42:49] what I Repent I'm sorry I said I was
[42:50] going to destroy you and Jonah finds out
[42:52] about it and it displeased him
[42:53] exceedingly he was very angry verse two
[42:55] he's basically I knew this would happen
[42:56] I knew it that's why I didn't want to go
[42:59] because I knew they would say they were
[43:00] sorry I knew that you were a god of
[43:02] patience and God of kindness that you
[43:03] would be slow to anger and that you
[43:05] would say repent and then they would
[43:07] repent and you would forgive them
[43:09] I wish you were a different kind of God
[43:13] right
[43:14] and then this is how bad it gets for
[43:16] Jonah and you can read the rest of the
[43:17] book because it gets really pitiful for
[43:19] a moment there therefore now oh Lord
[43:21] take I beseech thee my life from me
[43:25] if it is better for me to die than to
[43:27] live
[43:28] this is this is horrible
[43:31] John is so upset
[43:34] that the ninevites
[43:36] the ones he hates these Idol worshipers
[43:38] these mean-spirited people
[43:40] are now turning around and repenting
[43:43] I said I this displeases me I'm not
[43:46] happy about this
[43:48] and he goes so far as I say go ahead and
[43:50] just kill me
[43:51] I do not want to live in a world with an
[43:52] innovite serve you
[43:55] I don't want to live in a world where
[43:57] those that I hate
[43:59] I actually love the thing I love
[44:03] and to find it's the same thing that
[44:04] became a struggle for the Jews in the
[44:05] beginning of the Christian church to
[44:07] accept Gentiles because of prejudice
[44:09] because of bias
[44:10] imagine how hard it would have been for
[44:11] them and I wanted to explore it tonight
[44:13] a little bit how to how they could
[44:14] accept us all
[44:16] you killed Stephen
[44:18] talk about a talk about love and hate
[44:20] colliding
[44:22] but now not necessarily
[44:25] as a balancing but coming Head to Head
[44:29] right like this wrong kind of hatred is
[44:31] surfacing within Jonah and he's saying I
[44:34] I I I I hate him I hate them they hate
[44:37] thee God but now when the when their
[44:39] hatred changes his doesn't
[44:44] right so because perfect hatred
[44:46] if Jonah's hatred had been correct
[44:49] as soon as God's heart turned
[44:51] his heart would have turned
[44:54] now look at Matthew chapter 6 verse 24
[44:56] with me that I'm going to consider that
[44:58] a foundation
[45:04] and if you're worried like you build a
[45:06] foundation then you build a house and
[45:07] you're worried that this might be some
[45:09] sort of three-story condo
[45:10] just a Pergola tonight all right
[45:13] the only thing that's going up is just a
[45:15] few more you know four corner posts and
[45:18] some trusses and maybe we'll roof it
[45:20] later
[45:22] but Matthew 6 24 no man can serve two
[45:24] masters remember the conclusion of this
[45:26] therefore seek ye first the kingdom of
[45:29] God
[45:30] so it puts one thing as the ultimate no
[45:33] man can serve two masters
[45:35] for heal they hate the one and love the
[45:37] other or else he will hold to the one
[45:39] and despise the other there's a lot of
[45:41] wisdom in this if someone has two
[45:42] masters that it creates this competition
[45:45] it creates this manipulation it's Rife
[45:47] for turning and pitting it's the same
[45:50] kind of dynamics that exist in a split
[45:52] home where uh the father and mother are
[45:54] no longer married and they both have a
[45:55] love for their children and children
[45:57] both have a love for their parents and
[45:58] there's some sort of loyalty that they
[46:00] want to have equally for both but yet
[46:01] they hate each other
[46:03] right the father and mother hate each
[46:05] other and maybe it sounds more like
[46:06] we're describing uh the in-laws of the
[46:09] neighbor and the apartment next door but
[46:10] we recognize those Dynamics in a split
[46:12] home where now the children are
[46:14] constantly being torn between and it's
[46:17] such a difficult thing it's just a real
[46:19] logical statement you either hate the
[46:20] one and love the other else he'll hold
[46:22] the one and despise the other you cannot
[46:23] serve God and Mammon
[46:25] it says no no one can serve two masters
[46:28] the word is translated to Lord in other
[46:29] places in the New Testament but to be a
[46:32] master it's he to whom a person belongs
[46:35] that's a about which he has power of
[46:38] deciding so a master means a master of
[46:41] something means something belongs to
[46:42] them and they have power to decide to be
[46:45] a master means the owner
[46:47] the possessor and disposer of a thing
[46:49] one who has control
[46:52] so he says no man can serve two masters
[46:54] you cannot it's almost it's a
[46:56] contradiction in terms that you cannot
[46:59] be under the control of one who has the
[47:01] sole power of deciding and also be under
[47:03] the control of another who has the sole
[47:05] power of deciding it's almost a
[47:07] contradiction of terms it cannot happen
[47:10] and and in the same sense that some
[47:12] people think the terminology Military
[47:14] Intelligence is a paradox uh let this or
[47:17] oxymoronic in this sense two masters is
[47:20] right and listen this isn't rocket
[47:23] surgery I think you could you guys could
[47:24] figure this out
[47:26] that as these
[47:28] as you have a loyalty to one and he
[47:30] demands full obedience you have a loyal
[47:32] to another he demands full obedience he
[47:34] said this is this is not you cannot do
[47:37] this
[47:38] and so if I could back up Godly jealousy
[47:40] when God there's a Godly jealousy it
[47:43] means that God's love does not make room
[47:45] for any other love or lovers
[47:47] there's no other room for it I am a
[47:50] jealous God that means you can only love
[47:52] me
[47:54] and you say oh well that doesn't sound
[47:56] very Godly well that is very Godly you
[47:59] can't have this is the nature of love
[48:01] that you if you love me a jealous God
[48:04] says well then you can't say that you
[48:06] love me and you love this God and you
[48:08] love that God you love this equally this
[48:10] kind of love Demands a loyalty
[48:13] if that's hard for you it's it's what
[48:16] exists within within uh what ought to
[48:18] exist within a marriage where that love
[48:20] is for your wife it's not shared
[48:22] anywhere else
[48:23] that's what's reflected in that Union in
[48:26] that bond that this is not something
[48:27] that's shared this is not something well
[48:29] I love you and I love you and I love you
[48:31] and I love you and you have these
[48:32] Privileges and everyone else has these
[48:33] privileges it speaks the nature of this
[48:35] love speaks of fidelity
[48:38] and it says that this The Godly jealousy
[48:40] means there's no other room for any
[48:41] other lovers any other loaves
[48:43] God must be the owner he must be the
[48:45] sole possessor of our love
[48:48] hey he must be the only one who has
[48:50] control of our heart
[48:51] and so to me that's what perfect love is
[48:54] is when we finally yield it all to him
[48:56] and he's the sole controller of our
[48:57] hearts I would say he has all of your
[48:59] soul if you want to use it in terms that
[49:01] his baptism Holy Ghost has possessed our
[49:03] hearts then the rest is him possessing
[49:05] everything else that exists every door
[49:07] every Spirit every affection
[49:09] having preeminence
[49:12] so perfect love is when
[49:14] all your heart holy and completely is to
[49:17] God Alone every affection everyone every
[49:20] ambition every desire
[49:23] you cannot serve two masters you cannot
[49:25] love two masters requires that you love
[49:27] one and hate the other
[49:30] in James 4 4 ye adulterers and
[49:32] adulteresses know ye not that the
[49:34] Friendship of the world is enmity with
[49:36] God
[49:37] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[49:38] the world is the enemy of God
[49:41] to have some sort of in moderate love or
[49:43] prevailing desire to the world
[49:46] if this is if that's where your
[49:48] loyalties lie whoever is a friend of the
[49:51] world
[49:52] whoever concedes to the world
[49:54] compromises with the world he said you
[49:55] cannot do that and stay loyal to God
[49:59] if your prevailing desire just it's on
[50:02] its face you're saying friendship with
[50:03] the world is enmity with God to to be
[50:05] that kind of friend to have that kind of
[50:06] kinship to have that kind of loyalty to
[50:08] the things of the world and to the
[50:09] fleshes that puts you against God that
[50:11] makes you that that's hatred to God
[50:16] and we've read this in first John 2 15
[50:18] love not the world neither the things
[50:19] that are in the world if any man loved
[50:21] the world the love of the father is not
[50:22] in him
[50:24] I want you to recognize these things as
[50:26] both of them
[50:28] it's
[50:30] it says that friendship with the world
[50:32] when it's the ugly side is its hatred
[50:34] towards God
[50:36] that the more that you align yourself
[50:38] with these things its soils and and
[50:40] muddies and it perverts and it sours
[50:42] Your Love towards God it becomes hatred
[50:44] and animosity towards God because that's
[50:46] just the way love and hate work
[50:48] that's just the way loyalties are you
[50:50] can't you can't serve them both
[50:53] only through love and loyalty to God can
[50:55] we arrive at then this this is a
[50:58] conclusion of this and I realize now I I
[51:00] feel that I've
[51:02] definitely inadequately have conveyed
[51:04] this but in reading this Matthew 6 24
[51:06] James 4 4 first John 2 15 and if we
[51:09] could maybe take a step back and say
[51:10] there's love for God there's hatred for
[51:11] the world there's friendship with the
[51:12] world and hatred for God and kind of see
[51:14] this uh these different sides and how
[51:17] God's jealousy says you can only have
[51:19] one love
[51:21] I'm a jealous God so that love that you
[51:23] have if it's not to me then it gets it's
[51:25] spread out or it's divided and that
[51:27] becomes a dangerous sore spot for you
[51:29] becomes a point of weakness it's going
[51:31] to breed hatred and animosity towards
[51:33] things that are me or or of me a better
[51:35] for me
[51:36] so then if there if there must be then
[51:38] as I've said perfect hatred only exists
[51:40] in light of God's perfect love that
[51:41] perfect love and perfect hate a perfect
[51:43] love cannot exist without perfect hate
[51:45] it's only through this love this
[51:47] devotion this loyalty Fidelity to God
[51:49] this uh faithfulness to God that we can
[51:52] ever arrive at a true hatred for the
[51:54] world
[51:55] the only way that we can and I know I've
[51:57] already said it but maybe just saying it
[51:58] different way is the only way that we
[52:00] could have that opposite hatred for the
[52:01] world is by having a greater love for
[52:04] God we cannot arrive at perfect hatred
[52:07] or pure hatred or true hatred for sin
[52:09] without first having love and loyalty to
[52:12] God
[52:13] God is Not arming us just to hate sin
[52:15] and he's not just arminess to hate lies
[52:18] and feet that are Swift or mischief and
[52:19] hate those that bear false Witnesses so
[52:21] we're just let the Liars raise their
[52:23] hands heads let them all raise their
[52:25] hand and I'm just going to chop off all
[52:26] the heads of the Liars let somebody
[52:27] speak against this message come on I
[52:30] dare you I dare you to raise up and
[52:32] that's all we're doing is looking for
[52:33] someone's head to cut off
[52:35] let in any any distaste or hatred for
[52:40] anything of lying and anything
[52:42] Antichrist it exists as a consequence of
[52:45] falling in love with God
[52:50] and so we arrive at Luke 14 26.
[52:54] and now this becomes
[52:56] very very heavy
[53:00] in Luke 14 26 If any man come to me and
[53:03] hate not his father
[53:05] and mother and wife and children and
[53:08] Brethren and cisterns Yea and his own
[53:11] life also he cannot be my disciple
[53:16] I can't be his master I can't be his
[53:18] teacher can't be his Lord can't be his
[53:19] controller can't be the one that will
[53:21] lead him God I can't be the one that
[53:22] he's loyal along to
[53:25] if he doesn't hate his mom his dad his
[53:27] wife his children his brothers his
[53:29] sisters
[53:30] that's how it reads right
[53:33] I didn't pull it up from any other
[53:34] translations and I could do it and you
[53:36] know what you know all the things I've
[53:37] read I mean it they've all I mean even
[53:40] some of the modernist
[53:42] they all just kind of go yeah that's
[53:45] what it says
[53:47] hey
[53:49] If any man come to me and hate not his
[53:51] father
[53:52] mother wife children brother and sisters
[53:55] and even himself it can't be my disciple
[53:58] now I'll say the correct interpretation
[54:00] of this is critical
[54:02] what does Christ mean to hate right
[54:04] because he says we should
[54:06] he's saying you're not a good disciple
[54:07] unless you hate your mom
[54:09] hey and some of you are thinking
[54:13] next never knew my dad
[54:16] next right you're thinking I think I'm
[54:18] getting there I think I found perfect
[54:20] love
[54:22] but what does he mean by this what could
[54:25] he mean
[54:27] and now let me say this
[54:30] we may confuse hatred of the world for
[54:33] the love of God
[54:36] in other words we we have hate but we
[54:39] confuse it as love like this is my love
[54:40] for God that's what causes me to hate
[54:42] because we hate something that we think
[54:44] God hates
[54:46] in other words we're trying to align
[54:48] ourselves with David had a perfect
[54:49] hatred God hates Abomination God hates
[54:51] Liars they're nothing but a liar I hate
[54:52] them and we're trying to we're trying to
[54:54] find ourselves in this Niche where this
[54:56] guy this is this is how God feels so
[54:58] this is how I feel this is how God feels
[55:00] so this is how I feel and we're trying
[55:01] to hide behind God with all of our hates
[55:04] so that we're kind of standing behind
[55:06] God says let me Adam right he's a liar
[55:09] yeah you're filthy but we're standing
[55:11] behind God right and it's like yeah he's
[55:14] my protection for all these ways I feel
[55:15] about this person
[55:18] and I would say it's easy to despise
[55:20] someone we disagree with
[55:24] and not only is it easy to despise
[55:26] someone we disagree with but then it's
[55:28] easy to imagine it's because we love God
[55:30] more
[55:32] it's easy to imagine that the reason why
[55:33] I don't love them the reason why I hate
[55:35] them the reason why I don't like them
[55:37] the reason why we don't get along the
[55:38] reason why this the reason why that is
[55:39] because we love God
[55:41] because we love this message because we
[55:43] want to keep it pure we don't want to
[55:44] bring any smut on it we want to be loyal
[55:46] we want to be fierce we're the zealots
[55:47] of this end time we got to keep this
[55:49] message honorable we got to keep it pure
[55:52] and we argue it's the love for God
[55:55] when the real reason for our hate is the
[55:57] decaying of our nature
[56:00] because our Nature's decaying it's easy
[56:03] for us to say oh no no this is this is
[56:05] perfectly
[56:06] what brother Brandon this is perfectly
[56:08] what Christ would do this is what this
[56:10] is what the Bible requires this is this
[56:12] is Godly jealousy this is hating
[56:14] unrighteousness this is righteous
[56:16] indignation
[56:18] and we suppose that it's our love for
[56:21] God when the real reason for our hate is
[56:23] not an increase of Grace
[56:26] but the further degrading of our nature
[56:30] if I could come and arrive at oh the
[56:36] the thrust of this when I read this if
[56:38] any man come to me and hate not his
[56:39] father and mother his wife his children
[56:40] brother and sisters
[56:46] many people do not find it difficult to
[56:48] hate
[56:50] I said it before the hard sayings of
[56:52] Christ are only pure to those who find
[56:54] them hard
[56:56] that if
[56:58] reading this
[57:00] they find it easy you find it easy to
[57:03] relate you find it easy to to step into
[57:05] and say oh yeah oh yeah that makes
[57:07] perfect sense
[57:09] if there if there's somebody who had
[57:10] already written it out says I was
[57:12] wondering when he'd come to this this
[57:13] whole series on perfect love I've had
[57:15] one ending point had one spot to end on
[57:17] it would be this
[57:21] and many may have find it
[57:25] very easy to hate
[57:27] and I realize now as I'm looking at this
[57:29] I don't know French very well I don't
[57:31] know French at all except and
[57:34] I'm going to say this wrong but Francois
[57:36] Marriott
[57:38] maybe that was a little French and
[57:40] Spanish Jesu
[57:42] he wrote a book in 1936 in French I
[57:45] haven't read it
[57:46] it was translated later and I've studied
[57:48] this different portion in chapter nine
[57:50] it's entitled Judas
[57:53] and
[57:54] because it provides these hypothetical
[57:56] thoughts of Judas to the sayings of
[57:58] Christ
[57:59] now that's fascinating isn't it what was
[58:01] Judas thinking when Jesus said these
[58:04] things because we do have one Glimpse
[58:05] where Judas is like oh no
[58:07] we could have sold this
[58:10] sold this or and John's like and he said
[58:13] that because he's a thief
[58:15] right like we hear Judas sounding very
[58:18] honorable very politically correct
[58:19] thinking of the poor that's the real
[58:21] nature of Christ and really John's like
[58:23] no no he's a thief no he he just wants
[58:25] the coin man he's in this for himself
[58:28] and so this hypothetical thoughts of
[58:31] Judas to the Saints of Christ he writes
[58:33] in Matthew chapter 10 verse 21 and I'm
[58:35] using this to kind of amplify Luke 14
[58:37] 26. there says Jesus is saying unless
[58:39] you hate your mom and dad your brother
[58:40] and sister and even yourself you can't
[58:42] be my disciple and so we feel that we
[58:44] have some injunction to hate
[58:47] and Jesus says in 10 Matthew 10 21 and
[58:49] the brother shall deliver up the brother
[58:50] to death and the father of the child and
[58:53] the children shall rise up against their
[58:55] parents and cause them to be put to
[58:56] death
[58:59] mariak says
[59:01] that the other disciples were mortified
[59:04] that when Jesus said this the other
[59:06] disciples found themselves saying
[59:08] what kind of horror is this
[59:11] maybe even beginning to think wait a
[59:13] minute
[59:15] does that mean that my brother will put
[59:17] me to death or I'm going to need to
[59:19] cause my parents to be put to death
[59:21] what is the Messiah gonna what are we
[59:23] going to be compelled to do what are we
[59:25] getting conscripted into
[59:26] and there was there was there were more
[59:28] they were horrified to think that
[59:30] brother is going to deliver his brother
[59:31] to death father the children there's
[59:32] going to be the Civil War causing he put
[59:34] to death and and mariach writes it that
[59:36] these disciples find themselves shocked
[59:40] stunned it's revolting to them but he
[59:42] says not Judas
[59:44] Judas loved it
[59:47] that there was something about Judas
[59:48] where he was something he could take to
[59:50] very easily to where Judas when he heard
[59:53] it was kind of like oh yeah
[59:54] yeah I get that
[59:56] that makes perfect sense
[59:57] that there's something in him that's
[59:59] that took to it I think even C.S Lewis
[1:00:02] said it put it this way he took to it
[1:00:03] like water off a duck to water
[1:00:06] like you mean that I'm going to need to
[1:00:09] kill my brother sign me up
[1:00:13] like it was just something inside him
[1:00:14] and said I'm here I'm all in While
[1:00:17] others are thinking no no no you have to
[1:00:19] explain yourself Christy this can't be
[1:00:21] true
[1:00:23] and so I I say that to recognize that
[1:00:26] this is these are hard sayings
[1:00:28] and there should be some appropriate oh
[1:00:31] no
[1:00:32] in ourselves
[1:00:34] it says if I have to hate my father and
[1:00:36] my mother and my children my brothers
[1:00:37] and sisters in order to be his disciple
[1:00:40] there should be something inside of it
[1:00:41] says that's difficult that's hard I
[1:00:43] don't understand this in the same way
[1:00:45] when the Bible says spoil the rod spoil
[1:00:47] your child there should be a party that
[1:00:48] says oh
[1:00:49] is that then how does that look Lord
[1:00:52] how how do I apply that not just saying
[1:00:55] honey let's plant some more branches
[1:00:58] let's get some more switches up in here
[1:01:00] no there's there's got to be something
[1:01:02] inside it says no I
[1:01:04] surely surely there's got to be
[1:01:06] something a better way
[1:01:08] I'm not saying we challenge God or we're
[1:01:10] questioning God
[1:01:11] but it can't be that easy like it was
[1:01:13] for Judas
[1:01:15] and I'll say many selfish people
[1:01:16] convince themselves they love God
[1:01:19] because of their hate
[1:01:21] there's many selfish people that have
[1:01:24] convinced themselves they love this
[1:01:26] message because of their hate
[1:01:29] that they love the anti of the message
[1:01:31] because there's plenty of it
[1:01:33] but they have not they become more
[1:01:35] anti-anti-christ instead of Christ
[1:01:39] they recognize religion organize
[1:01:43] religion in its backside they recognize
[1:01:45] women are out of their place and they
[1:01:46] recognize the privity of human nature
[1:01:48] and they recognize homosexuals are doing
[1:01:50] this and they recognize governments are
[1:01:51] doing that and all big brother's doing
[1:01:53] this and the the Illuminati that and the
[1:01:56] One World ordered this and they've got
[1:01:58] all sorts of these conspiracy theories
[1:02:00] and these ideas and you'll find that
[1:02:01] what they really love about the message
[1:02:04] is the anti-side
[1:02:06] the consequence
[1:02:09] and not the real love
[1:02:11] they have the they they they really
[1:02:13] recognize that anti-anti-christ part
[1:02:15] it's because they've drawn their sword
[1:02:17] to everything else but it hasn't been
[1:02:18] the consequence of falling in love with
[1:02:20] Christ
[1:02:24] and there's a lot of people find
[1:02:25] themselves in this I told you in the
[1:02:27] beginning
[1:02:28] that this is what I was going to be
[1:02:30] looking at this dark side of this
[1:02:32] perverted love for God
[1:02:35] and people convinced this is a love for
[1:02:36] God because I hate
[1:02:39] because I'm loyal because I'm zealous
[1:02:42] loyalism
[1:02:43] loyal yeah lowercase L I apologize
[1:02:48] didn't mean to call you out so clearly
[1:02:51] just slipped
[1:02:54] well now since we all know who we're
[1:02:56] talking about tonight
[1:03:06] you know it's true
[1:03:08] of people
[1:03:10] right
[1:03:12] they've convinced themselves they love
[1:03:13] God because they hate
[1:03:17] when really their love
[1:03:19] air quotes love
[1:03:21] is self-serving
[1:03:24] and their courage to criticize and to
[1:03:27] fight and draw their sword is nothing
[1:03:29] but cowardice
[1:03:33] go ahead write it down
[1:03:35] they're quote unquote courage
[1:03:38] to rail
[1:03:40] fight to use their Pulpit to bully They
[1:03:43] Call it Courage they call it being set
[1:03:45] for the defense of the Gospel but it's
[1:03:47] nothing but cowardness
[1:03:57] so then
[1:03:59] in light of Luke 14 26 Matthew 10 21
[1:04:02] is Christ
[1:04:04] I'm closing I'm coming to my clothes
[1:04:06] here is Christ the very heart of God
[1:04:09] the very love of God very God love
[1:04:11] himself if we could say it that way see
[1:04:13] asking us to hate in the same terms that
[1:04:16] we would use of hatred
[1:04:18] do we resent them
[1:04:20] do we laugh at them do we mock them
[1:04:23] do we score on them when they're we we
[1:04:25] mock them in their Calamity we mock
[1:04:27] their deception do we enjoy causing them
[1:04:29] pain
[1:04:31] I think it begs the question
[1:04:34] I believe that Christ is clarifying even
[1:04:36] more distinctly to us when he says if
[1:04:39] any man come to me and hate not his
[1:04:40] father and his mother if any man
[1:04:42] will not do that he's not worthy to be
[1:04:44] my disciple I believe he's clarifying
[1:04:45] more distinctly what it means to love
[1:04:47] God
[1:04:50] when he asks us to hate
[1:04:52] and not just merely asking us to hate
[1:04:57] it assumes some loyalty
[1:05:00] there's a presupposition that if you
[1:05:02] love me
[1:05:04] and you want to be my disciple
[1:05:08] then the hatred that he proposes here is
[1:05:11] to Simply reject any influence that
[1:05:13] calls you away from Christ
[1:05:16] I mean I I just feel like you can't
[1:05:18] you can't say that Christ is demanding
[1:05:21] that we hate in the same way that we
[1:05:22] hate in our human nature
[1:05:24] and that you can't say that he's saying
[1:05:26] love God and that this is this is
[1:05:28] something organic that Springs forth
[1:05:29] from itself and then he says and over
[1:05:31] here make sure you have a really healthy
[1:05:32] and robust hate tree
[1:05:34] right it's not it's not just a separate
[1:05:37] Garden it's not a separate attribute
[1:05:38] it's it's this the hatred that he's
[1:05:41] proposing is that we must reject any
[1:05:43] influence that calls us away from Christ
[1:05:44] because you cannot serve both
[1:05:48] one must be the priority
[1:05:50] one must be the absolute one must be the
[1:05:52] main thing
[1:05:53] so we must reject we must deny even the
[1:05:56] most the things that are the most
[1:05:57] precious to us
[1:05:59] he does not just say hey if you don't
[1:06:01] hate your hobbies if you don't hate your
[1:06:02] favorite sport if you don't hate your
[1:06:04] favorite Mexican food if you it's not
[1:06:05] that he just kind of picks things and
[1:06:07] say well you got to hate the desert
[1:06:08] we're kind of like oh
[1:06:09] we're in no I mean he picks the things
[1:06:12] in the heart that should be the hardest
[1:06:14] to hate
[1:06:16] he's not just saying that well if you
[1:06:17] got to hate you got to hate the Redskins
[1:06:19] and they don't even exist anymore you're
[1:06:21] gonna hate this you gotta hate that it's
[1:06:22] it's not that it's not rivalry it's not
[1:06:25] Petty things
[1:06:27] but then you must deny even the things
[1:06:29] that are most precious to you if they
[1:06:31] come between you and your love for God
[1:06:34] anything that steps in the way you got
[1:06:36] to say out of the way
[1:06:38] anything that tries to usurp his first
[1:06:39] place you got to get out of the way
[1:06:41] anything that tries to replace him is
[1:06:43] your first love you got to get out of
[1:06:44] the way no matter who it is
[1:06:47] whether it's your mom your dad your wife
[1:06:49] your husband
[1:06:50] right he's saying it doesn't matter and
[1:06:52] he takes those things that are closest
[1:06:53] to your heart did you have the greatest
[1:06:54] Affinity to you say it to a Jew to her
[1:06:57] bloodline family meant everything
[1:07:00] and Jesus knows I hope you can catch
[1:07:02] this part
[1:07:02] Jesus knows
[1:07:05] that it'll look and feel like hatred
[1:07:09] to them that you do that to
[1:07:11] because love is so easily misunderstood
[1:07:18] of Christ
[1:07:22] was that to put Christ first as somebody
[1:07:25] else's expense well to them feel like
[1:07:27] hatred to them will feel like rejection
[1:07:29] is that not so
[1:07:31] maybe we've been on the other side of it
[1:07:33] at some time and we felt that it was
[1:07:35] very blunt and very hard and very
[1:07:37] hurtful but then when we realized that
[1:07:39] this was because the love of God we find
[1:07:41] that love is so easily misunderstood so
[1:07:43] Jesus puts it in a language so that we
[1:07:45] can understand what it they'll feel in
[1:07:48] what it may look like because to them
[1:07:50] that's exactly how it feels
[1:07:53] it feels like hatred
[1:07:57] I heard the huh
[1:07:59] Matthew 10 34.
[1:08:03] not that this will resolve the huh
[1:08:07] but it's going to be one of my last
[1:08:09] scriptures to read to you tonight
[1:08:11] to again see so starkly how Christ is
[1:08:15] Raising this could we not see the image
[1:08:17] of a jealous God
[1:08:19] a hating God a vengeful God is going to
[1:08:21] repay
[1:08:22] there's this nature in this character of
[1:08:24] God
[1:08:25] I hope it's I hope I I think I've said
[1:08:28] things just feeling that I've got
[1:08:29] um I've got an audience that's
[1:08:31] connecting these things too that are
[1:08:33] that are deeper than just what I'm
[1:08:34] saying in terms of even how people try
[1:08:36] to characterize this message and use
[1:08:37] this message and you find it's been
[1:08:39] detached from the love of God doesn't
[1:08:41] have that other side to it it doesn't
[1:08:43] have the love anymore
[1:08:44] so now it's just a caudulent it's just a
[1:08:46] bully pulpit just beating people up it's
[1:08:48] just beating things up
[1:08:50] it's like where's the other side do it
[1:08:52] and that's where we become the thief and
[1:08:54] the parable of the Good Samaritan
[1:08:56] we're just robbing people we're just
[1:08:58] stripping them we're just leaving them
[1:08:59] half dead
[1:09:04] in Matthew 10 34-37 think not that I'm
[1:09:07] come to send peace on Earth so what were
[1:09:09] the angels singing on that day when you
[1:09:10] were born
[1:09:12] I
[1:09:13] like it was that kind of Cryptid cryptic
[1:09:15] like we welcome peace come on and Jesus
[1:09:18] kind of stand out there behind the
[1:09:19] corner like are they coming
[1:09:21] watch this
[1:09:22] all right he says but don't think I've
[1:09:23] come to send peace on Earth obviously
[1:09:25] that speaks to kind of the misconception
[1:09:27] of the Kingdom at the time I come not to
[1:09:29] send peace but a sword
[1:09:32] for I am come to set a man at variance
[1:09:36] against his father
[1:09:38] and the daughter against her mother
[1:09:41] and the daughter-in-law against her
[1:09:43] mother-in-law
[1:09:45] and
[1:09:48] and why does it not say the son-in-law
[1:09:50] against the mother-in-law
[1:09:53] assumed
[1:10:00] I've come to I have a wonderful
[1:10:03] mother-in-law by the way
[1:10:05] I know she doesn't stream
[1:10:08] but uh wonderful in-laws said a man at
[1:10:10] variance against his father and the
[1:10:12] daughter against her mother and the
[1:10:13] daughter-in-law against her mother this
[1:10:14] is what happens
[1:10:15] this is this is Christ says I come to
[1:10:17] bring I'm not coming to bring everyone
[1:10:19] together and Kumbaya and peace I come to
[1:10:21] sin I don't come to sin peace but a
[1:10:23] sword now it's painting quite the
[1:10:25] picture maybe even instinctively we like
[1:10:26] to drill down on that and kind of get
[1:10:28] real heavy and underline that part of it
[1:10:29] and then he goes in further a man's foe
[1:10:31] shall be they of his own household
[1:10:34] this is this is difficult this is
[1:10:37] conflict this is gut-wrenching this is
[1:10:39] this is horrible and maybe again as it's
[1:10:42] in Matthew chapter 10. and I didn't read
[1:10:44] further in what Marriott says about
[1:10:45] Judas in this particular instance but
[1:10:47] maybe at this point the disciples are
[1:10:49] going oh
[1:10:50] oh
[1:10:51] and Judas is over there going sharpening
[1:10:54] his sword
[1:10:55] okay all right I like where this is
[1:10:58] going and this seems easy to him
[1:11:01] and then he says this and I think this
[1:11:02] kind of becomes that clarifying part he
[1:11:05] that loveth father a mother more than me
[1:11:08] is not worthy of me
[1:11:09] he that loved that son or daughter more
[1:11:11] than me is not worthy of me
[1:11:15] in other words these things cannot stand
[1:11:17] in competition to Christ
[1:11:20] therefore we must be willing to reject
[1:11:22] and renounce even those things that are
[1:11:25] the most precious to us
[1:11:27] if they interfere with our love for God
[1:11:29] we must be willing to act as though we
[1:11:31] hated them
[1:11:32] that's what he's saying they interfere
[1:11:35] with my love to God if they interfere
[1:11:36] with my keeping his Commandments if they
[1:11:37] interfere with my uh my convictions
[1:11:40] towards the word of God and I know this
[1:11:42] may take on a different this sound to
[1:11:45] some people a different look but in its
[1:11:46] most simple terms if they interfere with
[1:11:49] me loving God and keeping his
[1:11:51] Commandments then I must be willing to
[1:11:54] act as though I hated them
[1:11:59] when our love compels our love to him
[1:12:01] compels us to act a certain way when our
[1:12:03] love for him is driving us it's love I
[1:12:06] must give vent to my Revelation I must
[1:12:08] love him I I must be I express this I
[1:12:11] must do these things for him we cannot
[1:12:13] let human emotions deter us
[1:12:16] because it's in those moments where
[1:12:17] maybe the human affinity is the human
[1:12:19] emotions
[1:12:20] what causes I I find that even it
[1:12:23] becomes one of the biggest mistakes we
[1:12:24] make in parenting is in our love for our
[1:12:28] children we'll we'll let down on the
[1:12:30] word of God and the standard
[1:12:33] right we'll let it down for the sake of
[1:12:35] not wanting to do this to him not
[1:12:36] wanting to do that to him when in
[1:12:37] reality that's the wrong kind of love
[1:12:39] that you don't really love them you you
[1:12:41] that's the that's it's a it's a
[1:12:43] perverted love not perfect love
[1:12:47] because anything that would get in the
[1:12:49] way
[1:12:51] of loving God you must be willing to act
[1:12:54] as though you hate it
[1:12:57] our emotions can easily deceive us
[1:12:58] especially when it comes to love we have
[1:13:00] her spouse and for family for friends
[1:13:04] and so when the word compels us
[1:13:08] he said you must be willing to because
[1:13:10] if you love father mother more than me
[1:13:11] you're not worthy if you love son or
[1:13:13] daughter more than me you're not worthy
[1:13:15] then I must occupy that Soul place
[1:13:21] and since our emotions
[1:13:24] I must finish with this our emotions can
[1:13:26] deceive us
[1:13:30] it's hard to know when the duty to hate
[1:13:32] arises
[1:13:36] and I would hope
[1:13:38] that we find it hard
[1:13:41] to find to know when that duty to hate
[1:13:44] arises
[1:13:47] and I will say those that truly love God
[1:13:49] will not arrive early at hate
[1:13:52] nor will they gladly embrace the sword
[1:13:56] Jesus I come not to bring peace I come I
[1:13:59] I come to bring a sword
[1:14:00] I say if we truly love God we won't
[1:14:03] arrive easily at the at that sword
[1:14:06] we have the sword it's at our disposal
[1:14:08] but if we truly love God we're not
[1:14:10] always going
[1:14:11] right first response
[1:14:14] first thing we do right
[1:14:16] somebody crosses us we're just over
[1:14:18] there like a Peter prior to his birth
[1:14:21] where's the ear I'm going to cut off
[1:14:23] and it's almost instinct if we truly
[1:14:26] love God that's not our default
[1:14:28] in Philippians 3 18
[1:14:30] Paul writing says from any walk of whom
[1:14:32] I've told you often and now tell you
[1:14:34] even weeping
[1:14:37] that they are the enemies of the Cross
[1:14:39] of Christ
[1:14:41] Paul's saying this isn't easy for me to
[1:14:43] say
[1:14:44] and if I've named names if I've
[1:14:45] corrected anyone if I'm calling out the
[1:14:47] Antichrist I don't do it with Glee
[1:14:50] I'm not giddy about it I I say it even
[1:14:54] now weeping
[1:14:55] that an enemy to Christ
[1:14:58] it it Sorrows me
[1:15:01] he said I wouldn't all Israel would be
[1:15:03] saved
[1:15:04] it's not something that he could that he
[1:15:06] arrived he arrived at that conclusion
[1:15:09] that they those that I'm talking about
[1:15:11] they're enemies of Christ and being
[1:15:12] enemies of Christ I I must detest them I
[1:15:15] must stand against them I must hate the
[1:15:17] sin I I can't have be in League with
[1:15:19] them I can't have friendship with them
[1:15:21] he recognized the loss
[1:15:24] and so those of us who truly love God
[1:15:25] will not arrive early at this kind of
[1:15:27] hate
[1:15:29] it I
[1:15:30] no man can serve two masters he'll
[1:15:32] either hate one or love the other so if
[1:15:34] any man come to me and hate not his
[1:15:35] father mother wife children brothers and
[1:15:37] sisters or his own life he cannot be my
[1:15:39] disciple
[1:15:40] that hate
[1:15:42] that hate I hope for you
[1:15:44] is not something easily grasped
[1:15:47] but selfish abusive people will quickly
[1:15:50] grab the sword
[1:15:52] and easily hate
[1:15:55] I'll close by saying there's many women
[1:15:58] who convince themselves
[1:16:01] that they loved God
[1:16:03] and they love the message by abandoning
[1:16:04] their husbands
[1:16:10] they do it in the name of the message
[1:16:12] they do it because of their loyalties to
[1:16:14] the message
[1:16:16] and they convince themselves
[1:16:18] that they love God by hating their
[1:16:20] husbands
[1:16:21] men will convince themselves that
[1:16:23] divorce and separation
[1:16:26] declared loyalty and dedication to God
[1:16:32] is this the wrong note to end on
[1:16:36] I'm not saying all men
[1:16:39] I'm not saying all women
[1:16:42] but there's those that do it
[1:16:45] and they blame God
[1:16:47] for their hate
[1:16:49] and if they did an autopsy on it
[1:16:52] they'd find the love of God was never in
[1:16:54] it
[1:16:56] and so I'll say this
[1:16:58] you'll never
[1:17:00] arrive at perfect love through hating
[1:17:04] you'll never do it
[1:17:06] you'll never arrive at a greater
[1:17:07] obedience
[1:17:08] you'll never arrive at a greater
[1:17:10] understanding you'll never arrive at a
[1:17:11] greater Harmony in unity with God and
[1:17:13] one another through hate
[1:17:15] but only by Falling in Love More
[1:17:18] that's the only way you can do it
[1:17:22] and in loving more
[1:17:25] I trust that hate will find its place
