[1:10] going to flip to um
[1:12] isaiah 29
[1:20] if you haven't say amen okay job chapter
[1:23] 2
[1:24] verse 9 the bible says then said his
[1:26] wife unto him
[1:28] does thou still retain thy integrity
[1:30] curse god
[1:31] and die but he said unto her
[1:35] thou speaketh as a foolish woman

[2:00] isaiah 29 and let's start reading that
[2:02] verse
[2:04] um let's go to uh
[2:08] 18 16.
[2:12] isaiah 29 and 16 the bible says
[2:15] surely your turning of things upside
[2:18] down shall be
[2:19] esteemed as the potter's dick
[2:23] clay for shall the work say unto him
[2:27] shall the work say of him that made it
[2:30] he made me not or shall the things frame
[2:33] shake say of him that frame it
[2:37] he had no understanding amen going to
[2:39] read a familiar verse of scripture as
[2:41] you
[2:42] as you sit amen the bible says romans 8
[2:46] chapter 20
[2:47] romans 8 verse 28 it says and we know
[2:50] that all things work together for good
[2:52] to them that love god to them who are
[2:55] called according to his purpose
[2:57] amen may the lord bless you love his
[2:59] word you can have your seats
[3:06] how many happy in the lord today but
[3:09] aaron you're right this is kind of far
[3:11] back
[3:11] you must know i'm a walker amen but
[3:14] today by the grace of god my subject
[3:17] is god is intentional
[3:21] god is intentional now if you just take
[3:24] the word
[3:25] intentional intentional means
[3:28] on purpose you know and when we think
[3:31] about
[3:32] god and his intentions you know
[3:35] concerning us
[3:36] he's a purposeful god that there's
[3:39] nothing that god
[3:40] does that doesn't have any meaning so
[3:42] god is not
[3:43] like us he doesn't waste time he's not
[3:46] wasteful for anything that he does
[3:48] there's a purpose now what i what i
[3:51] really want to strike
[3:52] i want to show by the grace of god that
[3:55] in our lives
[3:56] you and us all of us today that
[4:00] we are exactly where god wants us to be
[4:03] amen i'm not necessarily talking about
[4:05] the church building
[4:07] but i'm talking about your life amen you
[4:09] are exactly where god wants you amen
[4:12] because he's a god that is intentional
[4:14] amen
[4:15] you know if if i could make this picture
[4:18] even more clearer
[4:19] how many understands that god created
[4:21] the devil
[4:22] hallelujah talk to me now god created
[4:26] his own
[4:27] enemy god knows what makes him tick
[4:30] god knows what gets him going god knows
[4:33] his strength and his weaknesses
[4:35] god knows how to defeat his own enemy
[4:38] hallelujah
[4:39] so you think about god god made satan
[4:42] with the purpose intentionally being
[4:45] able to defeat him
[4:49] whoa hallelujah now you think about that
[4:51] god
[4:52] who created satan with the purpose of
[4:55] him knowing that
[4:56] satan can bring out the best of god only
[4:59] to defeat him now when that god that
[5:02] holy ghost
[5:03] gets in you it doesn't change
[5:07] he still intentionally will
[5:10] defeat the devil hallelujah so i want
[5:13] you to be
[5:14] glad with the life god has given you
[5:16] thus far
[5:17] because he's a purposeful god and he
[5:20] doesn't make mistakes
[5:22] he doesn't tell lies hallelujah he
[5:24] doesn't fall
[5:25] up short everything he does is right on
[5:28] time
[5:29] it's intentional hallelujah and you know
[5:31] sometimes we look at our life
[5:33] and you say god why am i going through
[5:35] this all why did i go through that or
[5:37] why did i go through this
[5:38] simply because god knows exactly what
[5:40] you're supposed to be
[5:42] so he allows you to go through certain
[5:44] things to get you back to the place
[5:46] that he originally saw you amen because
[5:49] we have to look that
[5:50] god he doesn't have another thought so
[5:54] whatever he's thinking about you
[5:56] he already sought it before the
[5:57] foundation of the world
[5:59] he just has to get you in line to
[6:01] fulfill his thinking
[6:03] hallelujah so sometimes that causes a
[6:06] little trouble
[6:07] sometimes that causes trial and
[6:09] tribulation but god is saying
[6:11] okay if i do this they'll become that if
[6:14] i do this
[6:15] they'll become that so he's constantly
[6:18] redirecting our lives
[6:20] on this side in flesh to get us where
[6:22] we're supposed to be
[6:23] as spirit beings hallelujah but you know
[6:27] as i look in the in the scriptures and
[6:29] look in the word of god
[6:31] and what we just read he's intentional
[6:34] you know there's a song we're seeing and
[6:36] i'm sure some of you may have heard it
[6:38] it's called intentional and it says
[6:41] all things are working for his good he's
[6:44] intentional
[6:45] never failing see so i want you to
[6:48] realize that
[6:49] if god is doing something in your life
[6:51] how many of us are going through trials
[6:56] don't be ashamed that's a good thing
[6:59] because if you're not going through
[7:01] anything how will you ever become
[7:03] something greater
[7:04] hardly if you're not going through
[7:06] anything that challenges you
[7:08] you could never come into something
[7:10] greater that god has called you to be
[7:13] so the challenge is good the thing is
[7:16] can you surrender to the challenge
[7:18] hollywood surrender to it and say god
[7:20] have your way in my life now church if
[7:23] we look
[7:24] i hope you all don't mind me taking off
[7:25] my jacket if we look church in the bible
[7:29] you know when i read the book of job you
[7:31] know uh
[7:32] job he went through a lot but what i
[7:36] want you to understand
[7:37] it wasn't of job's choosing
[7:40] how many knows why joe went through what
[7:43] he went through
[7:46] who caused job to go through that battle
[7:49] who was the one spearheading job losing
[7:53] all his riches
[7:54] losing all his possessions losing all of
[7:57] his children
[7:58] you know even as even his wife looked at
[8:00] him one day and said i just can't stand
[8:01] the way your breath fell
[8:05] it's for real it did happen in the bible
[8:09] but she got to the place where she
[8:11] couldn't believe
[8:12] that we're going through this life was
[8:14] good and now all of a sudden
[8:17] we're going through all of us and she
[8:19] comes and tells job
[8:20] curse your god and die but you look
[8:23] church
[8:24] the whole battle was simply over a
[8:26] conversation
[8:28] a conversation that god had with the one
[8:31] he always defeated and now satan comes
[8:35] he's walking to and fro we know the
[8:37] story he's walking to and fro
[8:39] and then god comes with something
[8:41] intentional
[8:42] and he says hey devil have you
[8:45] considered
[8:46] my servant joel now god is pointing
[8:49] the devil in the direction he wants him
[8:52] to go
[8:55] hallelujah and what is that direction in
[8:58] the believer's way
[8:59] hell yeah now job was a believer now you
[9:02] got the one he's believing in
[9:05] is going to make his life a little bit
[9:07] more strenuous
[9:09] now he tells the devil hey i want you to
[9:11] go all that you're desiring
[9:13] go and put your hand on joe he said well
[9:15] you can't take his life
[9:17] see satan has boundaries satan has
[9:20] restrictions
[9:22] god only lets him go so far why because
[9:25] he intentionally
[9:26] told us that he cannot put any more
[9:29] on you than you can bear
[9:32] so no matter what the trial is we are to
[9:35] rejoice
[9:36] this morning because we got to come on
[9:38] top
[9:40] we have to overcome it because god can't
[9:43] change his word
[9:44] he intentionally said that nothing will
[9:46] be able to
[9:47] overcome us
[9:52] hallelujah so if we take that mind frame
[9:56] what kind of people should we be
[9:58] hallelujah
[9:59] what kind of church service should this
[10:01] be
[10:02] holy whether your bills are behind
[10:04] whether you're seeking your body
[10:06] satan cannot win why because god
[10:10] intentionally gave him permission to let
[10:13] you go through that
[10:15] holy satan can't do anything but
[10:18] first god allows it holy
[10:22] but what i love about it some of you may
[10:23] have heard me say this that
[10:25] before job even went through the trial
[10:28] god had a testimony service about job
[10:35] he said okay satan have you
[10:39] considered my servant job there's none
[10:42] like him in all the earth think about
[10:46] that
[10:47] god is still the same he's bragging on
[10:50] you
[10:50] to the devil while you're going through
[10:52] your trial
[10:53] earlier because he has to give
[10:55] permission for satan to even take you
[10:57] through certain things
[10:59] but before he goes to it he's basically
[11:01] telling the devil
[11:02] you're going to lose
[11:07] you're going to lose they're still like
[11:08] him and all the earth you go
[11:10] lose hallelujah they're still like job
[11:13] in all the earth but
[11:14] since you insist go ahead
[11:18] and now satan is so happy and so giddy
[11:20] because he gets to mess up things
[11:22] but all these things that he's messing
[11:24] up is making jobs stronger
[11:28] church look at that back in in the book
[11:31] of exodus
[11:32] the bible says that the more egypt
[11:35] afflicted
[11:36] the christian israel the more they
[11:38] multiply
[11:39] and the stronger they got earlier so you
[11:42] might not want me to say this
[11:44] but i'm going to say it affliction is
[11:46] good
[11:48] trials are good tribulation
[11:51] is good why because it's the tender hand
[11:54] of jehovah
[11:58] oh my but you look i love joe's response
[12:03] you know church we got to get to a place
[12:06] where we stop worrying about what people
[12:07] say about us
[12:10] because people may not understand what
[12:12] god is doing in your life
[12:14] they can only look on the outside and
[12:16] say hmm
[12:18] i wonder why this i wonder why that but
[12:20] god is intentional
[12:22] he has a purpose hallelujah and you know
[12:24] joe's friends
[12:26] them message believers they come up and
[12:29] now they're
[12:29] criticizing job with no proof
[12:35] all they got is that he's lost his
[12:38] riches
[12:38] he's lost this he's lost that he lost
[12:40] his children but they got no proof that
[12:42] he ever sinned
[12:43] all they got is accusation
[12:46] and now they're letting how the mind
[12:49] battles they're having
[12:50] hardly changed the testimony of their
[12:53] friend
[12:53] in their mind oh my
[12:57] how often do we see somebody going
[13:00] through something
[13:00] and we make a prejudgment with no
[13:03] evidence
[13:05] we're using our own human intellect
[13:08] to decide what should happen in that
[13:10] person's life
[13:12] but you know hollywood god was
[13:14] intentional
[13:15] by letting rahab go into prostitution
[13:21] it was intentional why because she had
[13:23] to be there
[13:24] for the spies many many years later when
[13:27] they came
[13:28] it had not only did it have to be a
[13:30] prostitute but it had to be somebody
[13:33] that could receive the word so he was
[13:37] intentional think about oh my
[13:38] you say oh my god let her uh prostitute
[13:42] it was intentional
[13:47] oh my and i know you may be looking at
[13:50] this and you'll be saying
[13:52] [Music]
[13:53] brothers i don't know about that well
[13:55] look what came out of it
[13:59] that's how you judge something the
[14:01] prophet god said you don't deserve it
[14:03] with your eyes
[14:04] you deserve you discern it by what comes
[14:06] out of it
[14:08] hallelujah you know and from that point
[14:10] if you take the prophet of god
[14:12] he said that rahab hallelujah she went
[14:15] into prostitution
[14:16] because she had sick parents
[14:21] so in her heart she never really wanted
[14:24] to be a prostitute
[14:26] but this was her way of survival and
[14:29] this was her way
[14:30] of taking care of her family hallelujah
[14:32] you notice when you say brothers i don't
[14:34] know about that
[14:35] well let's look at th let's look at the
[14:36] context you know a lot of times
[14:39] we look at something but we don't have
[14:41] the right context
[14:42] you know when i think about the message
[14:44] of the hour you know i'm not worried
[14:46] about hallelujah
[14:47] how many deers and how many bears and
[14:49] things brother branham shot
[14:51] that's not the context the context
[14:54] is the revelation of the word the
[14:56] context is the
[14:58] the context is not worrying about how
[15:01] much
[15:01] uh cherry pie he ate that's not the
[15:03] context the context is
[15:05] how much god walked in that life
[15:08] that's the context let's stay with that
[15:10] amen so you know
[15:12] you got people now these message
[15:14] believers
[15:15] who once believed what we believed but
[15:17] now they got the context wrong
[15:20] it's not about a bear that he never got
[15:22] it's about the god
[15:24] that was revealed
[15:27] let's not major on a minor hallelujah
[15:30] but you know church uh
[15:31] when we think about the context of
[15:33] things if you look at
[15:35] at the very context of what this man was
[15:37] going through
[15:38] now they're looking at it saying oh he's
[15:40] going through this he's going through
[15:41] that
[15:41] they're not even realizing that the hand
[15:43] of god is behind the whole thing
[15:47] and you look at the context of rahab's
[15:50] life when you're working through the
[15:51] scriptures
[15:51] they look at her and say well she was a
[15:53] prostitute but listen to the language
[15:56] when she met the word huh when the word
[15:58] came she started talking to him
[16:00] she said hey i want you guys to leave me
[16:02] a true token
[16:03] don't that sound like brian she didn't
[16:07] say leave a scarlet she said leave me a
[16:09] token
[16:12] hallelujah and not only that church just
[16:14] to show what was really in her heart
[16:16] and to show that she really didn't want
[16:18] to be that kind of person
[16:19] she said give me something that will
[16:21] save my father's house
[16:26] so in her heart all she really wanted
[16:28] was the best
[16:30] for her family so i could see why the
[16:32] prophet of god said
[16:34] that she was forced into that because of
[16:36] her love for her family
[16:37] because now she has a chance to come out
[16:39] of it who is she thinking about
[16:41] her family but you look at her
[16:45] being in the life of prostitution god is
[16:48] intentional
[16:51] why didn't he lead the spies up to a
[16:54] bishop's house or somebody else's house
[16:56] because they would have probably went
[16:58] against what god had did
[17:01] they probably couldn't believe what god
[17:03] was already
[17:04] doing out there in the wilderness
[17:08] because rahab said she said hey men's
[17:10] hearts
[17:11] melt for fear they can hear
[17:14] what your god has done at the red sea
[17:17] they can hear about
[17:18] how he fed them and he gave water out of
[17:20] a rock all the different
[17:21] we heard about your god and just hearing
[17:25] her faith was being built up enough to
[17:27] surrender
[17:28] when they come god allow these things to
[17:31] happen
[17:31] intentionally so when rahab's chance
[17:34] came
[17:35] she could go free oh yeah and when they
[17:38] came home
[17:39] she said give me a true token they said
[17:41] okay as long as you don't give out
[17:43] none of our business rahab kept a mouth
[17:45] chat
[17:48] secret believer
[17:52] hallelujah you know what and y'all
[17:55] probably heard me say that
[17:56] that's one of the greatest ministries of
[17:59] this end time
[18:02] one of the greatest ministries of the
[18:04] end time is the shut your mouth ministry
[18:09] stop worrying about everybody else stop
[18:12] worrying about what this person doing or
[18:13] that person doing
[18:14] the greatest ministry you could ever
[18:16] practice is to just set it up
[18:20] i learned that firsthand hallelujah
[18:24] you know because you can look at
[18:25] something in your children's life or
[18:27] whatever you may be thinking
[18:28] god why don't you intervene you know
[18:31] what to say lord i'll do it and god says
[18:33] shut up
[18:35] shut your mouth let me take care of us
[18:39] because i am the partner
[18:42] oh my church you know one of my favorite
[18:45] classes in high school
[18:46] was ceramics i mean y'all can't believe
[18:50] it right
[18:51] one of my favorite classes was the
[18:52] pottery class
[18:54] hardly it wasn't real masculine but what
[18:56] it dealt with
[18:58] pottery ceramics it deals with the image
[19:00] of your mind
[19:02] hello and what you got in your mind now
[19:05] coming before you at your own hands
[19:08] oh god think about that church god is
[19:11] the partner let me read you something
[19:13] right quick
[19:14] listen let me read you a quote from um
[19:16] from from micheal angelo
[19:17] we all know who michael angelo is right
[19:20] he's a great sculptor hey man
[19:22] one of michael angelo's quotes he says i
[19:24] saw the
[19:25] angel in the marble and carved until i
[19:28] set him free
[19:30] isn't that powerful as as as a as a
[19:34] artist he looks at a piece of rock and
[19:37] he has an image
[19:38] in his mind and he starts to work with a
[19:40] hammer and chisel
[19:41] to form that image that's it'll rock her
[19:44] and once that image
[19:45] meets the image of his mind he says then
[19:47] i set it free
[19:49] hallelujah think about that church holy
[19:52] we are
[19:52] six and five field dirt but god has an
[19:55] image in his mind
[19:56] so what does he do he hammers and he
[19:59] triples he
[19:59] trials to relation what is he doing he's
[20:02] trying to set us free
[20:06] you won't go free until you meet the
[20:08] image of the sculptor
[20:14] but if that rock had feelings when that
[20:17] hammer healed it was like ooh
[20:18] that children will say ah ooh ah
[20:22] but he has to keep on sculpting see i
[20:24] love the i love the message the
[20:26] masterpiece
[20:27] because you have to think about it the
[20:28] image in michelangelo's mind
[20:30] is never changed he probably had
[20:34] family he probably took breaks to go eat
[20:36] lunch he probably went out of time
[20:38] but every time he came back to that rock
[20:40] he had the same image of moses
[20:42] in his mind hallelujah churchill from
[20:45] generation to generation
[20:46] no matter what has happened ebola uh
[20:49] swine flu
[20:50] covet the image of god's mind of you
[20:53] does not
[20:54] change
[21:00] hallelujah
[21:02] let me read you know he says every block
[21:05] of stone
[21:07] has a statue inside it and it is the
[21:10] task
[21:11] of the sculptor to discover it
[21:16] this man got some real inspiration huh
[21:19] he said every piece of stone hunger
[21:22] has an image it has it's it's there's
[21:24] something in it but it takes the
[21:26] sculptor
[21:26] to discover it and you think about it
[21:29] they may be just looking at us as just
[21:31] regular people
[21:32] but there's a sculptor behind us
[21:35] that he's hammering he's chiseling and
[21:37] he he's sawing and
[21:39] everything else he got to do to get you
[21:41] into what you're supposed to be
[21:43] hallelujah because the prophet of god he
[21:45] said he said god
[21:49] i'm gonna read you a quote uh this is in
[21:52] the message um
[21:53] this is in question and answers he says
[21:56] and now
[21:56] in other words when you become a young
[21:59] man or a young woman and like
[22:00] god takes a picture of you now
[22:03] no matter how old and wrinkled
[22:07] how disfigured whatever it will be that
[22:11] will win right on down through and the
[22:14] body
[22:15] may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up
[22:18] by lions whatever but it will not change
[22:22] who you are in god's mind
[22:26] it can be disfigured you can have your
[22:28] head cut off
[22:29] but if you die hallelujah with the life
[22:32] of christ in you
[22:33] when the resurrection takes place holy
[22:35] that image that god has
[22:37] before the foundation of the world we'll
[22:39] rise
[22:41] we shall rise what's rising us that same
[22:45] power that raised up christ
[22:46] from the dead and you think about him he
[22:49] was crucified
[22:50] he was marred he was messed up more than
[22:52] any other man
[22:53] but when he rose he rose as god
[23:01] trials tribulations what is he doing
[23:06] god is producing the picture of his mind
[23:10] hell yeah because if you take
[23:14] you know now we're in such a technology
[23:16] age
[23:18] i want to let all you millennials know
[23:21] this was not the original way to take
[23:23] pictures
[23:30] hate to bust your bubble was not apple
[23:33] was not samson it was polaroid
[23:40] but you think about it let me take you
[23:41] through the process in the olden days
[23:44] what they would do was snap the picture
[23:46] and then you have to take that
[23:47] undeveloped picture and take it to a
[23:50] dark room
[23:51] hallelujah the only way that picture
[23:54] could be developed hallelujah
[23:56] was in a dark room hallelujah that there
[23:58] was something
[23:59] about the dark room that unveiled the
[24:02] mystery
[24:02] of what was taken out oh yeah
[24:06] it was something about that dark room
[24:08] that could unveil
[24:09] the true mystery of what that picture
[24:12] was when it was snapped hundley
[24:14] and what god does god allows you and i
[24:17] to go through a dark room
[24:18] because it's that dark room that's
[24:21] untelling the mystery
[24:22] of who you are hallelujah
[24:26] because without a child god will never
[24:29] know if you would stand cause we'd just
[24:32] be a bunch of small brats
[24:33] with god given us everything we ever
[24:35] wanted
[24:36] but he takes you through tests he takes
[24:39] takes you through trials
[24:40] just so he could show the whole world
[24:43] that you really
[24:44] are his child
[24:49] but you take that picture and it
[24:52] develops
[24:53] once it's developed it has to be hanged
[24:55] out to dry
[25:00] hallelujah there's no good just laying
[25:03] there
[25:04] it has to be hanged out to dry and
[25:06] sometimes we feel like as christians
[25:09] god has hung us out to dry but church
[25:12] it's intentional he's still in control
[25:16] see sometimes god wants to see what
[25:18] you're going to do
[25:20] well he already knows but what he does
[25:22] he does things to humble us
[25:24] to prove us to get us in a better spirit
[25:27] hallelujah and you know
[25:28] without trials without certain
[25:30] situations some of us we wouldn't even
[25:32] pray
[25:34] but because certain things happen we
[25:36] fall on our knees
[25:38] hallelujah so god he intentionally
[25:42] does things and you think about all that
[25:45] he did to job
[25:46] he allowed the enemy to do to job job
[25:49] lost
[25:49] everything but i love joe's response and
[25:52] i want you to catch this today
[25:54] job's response to his wife is honey do
[25:57] you
[25:57] expect to receive all good at the hand
[26:00] of god and no
[26:02] evil
[26:05] oh what are you saying brother jesus i'm
[26:08] saying
[26:09] god is in control of evil too
[26:15] he allows it to happen why for his
[26:18] purpose
[26:19] he allows certain things to move the way
[26:21] it moves for his purpose
[26:23] he allowed 68 million jews to die why
[26:27] to drive the rest of them back to the
[26:29] homeland
[26:33] oh my what a wonderful god
[26:36] so when we look at these things church
[26:38] we ought to have the mindset that
[26:40] oh god is in control now look he says
[26:43] but now
[26:44] this picture is the main thing then it's
[26:47] resurrect then this resurrection
[26:49] those those gasses and acids and the
[26:52] things come right
[26:53] back into the place and develops this
[26:55] picture again now this picture
[26:58] was not taken when you were 16 or 18
[27:01] we're talking about in the mind of god
[27:02] now
[27:03] it wasn't taken when you were 16 or 18
[27:05] or 20 years
[27:07] at your best when was it taken
[27:10] before there was a foundation of the
[27:13] world
[27:14] it was put in god's great file
[27:17] and for those of you who may be in
[27:19] business hallelujah you know what a file
[27:21] is
[27:22] a file is something that you can always
[27:24] go to
[27:25] because you remember where you put it a
[27:28] file is where you put
[27:29] important things something that you may
[27:31] have to come back and prove
[27:33] hallelujah come on somebody and you know
[27:36] god
[27:36] has a foul of all of his children and
[27:39] what he does
[27:41] god he can see certain things going
[27:44] happening in your life
[27:45] and he go to his file and he says yep
[27:47] they're supposed to go through that
[27:50] and you may get off track and you go
[27:52] through this and he'll say yep
[27:54] they're supposed to go through that see
[27:55] god knows exactly
[27:57] everything about you in his file in his
[28:00] file
[28:01] some of you have blue eyes some of you
[28:02] have brown eyes
[28:04] but that foul does not change honestly
[28:07] it's there
[28:08] for god to keep reminding himself of
[28:11] what he's done
[28:11] hallelujah but think about it
[28:15] think about this what if you could read
[28:17] your own file
[28:23] oh my what if you could go into god's
[28:26] great economy
[28:28] and pull up your own file that god has
[28:31] on you
[28:32] would that do something for you would
[28:34] that do something for you
[28:35] would that would that give you even more
[28:37] courage to to serve the lord
[28:39] well let me tell you he already has
[28:44] he's allowed you to look into the file
[28:47] of his mind when he sent the vindicated
[28:50] prophet
[28:51] he sent the vindicated prophet
[28:53] expressing the foul
[28:55] of the end time believer hallelujah
[28:57] because church i want you to understand
[28:59] the message is not books and tapes the
[29:02] message is the body of believers
[29:06] hallelujah redeemed holy ghost field
[29:09] believe us the message is not a city or
[29:13] state
[29:13] the message is the heart of the believer
[29:18] hallelujah am i taking anything away
[29:21] from the prophet no he tell you the same
[29:22] thing
[29:24] hug because if it was if it was a
[29:28] certain place
[29:29] a hurricane can come and tear that place
[29:30] down and destroy the message
[29:35] or blizzard or or hailstorm or whatever
[29:38] and destroy the message but no the
[29:40] message hallelujah
[29:41] is hidden in the heart of those that
[29:44] receive christ
[29:46] holy the true unveiling of christ
[29:49] hallelujah through a vindicated word
[29:51] that's been released in our day
[29:55] but as we look and we think about god
[29:58] and his
[29:59] great picture and all the things that he
[30:01] does you know some people ask the
[30:03] question
[30:04] they say if god was really real why
[30:06] would he allow this to happen
[30:08] he's intentional
[30:12] and most of you know that at a young age
[30:15] i had cancer
[30:18] cancer not in my arm or my leg but
[30:20] canceling my brain
[30:24] but that was intentional
[30:27] you think i'm gonna give the credit to
[30:29] the devil
[30:31] you think i'm saying oh the devil did
[30:33] this to me no
[30:34] if you allow yourself to say the devil
[30:36] did this to me
[30:38] you're saying the devil has control of
[30:39] your life
[30:42] so in my good days i give god praise in
[30:44] my bad days i give god praise
[30:46] in sickness and in hell i give god
[30:49] praise because he's the
[30:50] he's the only one that's controlling my
[30:53] being
[30:54] but church just to show you where i'm
[30:55] coming from at a very very young age
[30:58] i had cancer in my brain you know what
[31:00] the purpose of that cancer
[31:02] the whole purpose of that cancer was to
[31:05] hardly
[31:06] show me that there is a god
[31:10] because before that time i never knew
[31:13] god was a healer
[31:15] so god allowed me to go through
[31:17] something hungry
[31:18] to experience his attributes
[31:21] oh my so what is he doing for you amen
[31:24] god allows you to go through things that
[31:27] you may experience
[31:28] a portion of who he is he told abraham
[31:32] you're blessed to be a blessing but you
[31:35] look at all he had to go through
[31:37] everything that he went through was
[31:39] purposeful to get him in place
[31:41] so that he could be the father of
[31:43] nations hallelujah
[31:45] he didn't he would have never gotten
[31:47] there hurry up
[31:48] without him going to the kingdom and
[31:51] been like seeing his wife and taking his
[31:52] wife
[31:53] he never got there he had to go through
[31:56] that
[31:57] he would have never got there without
[31:58] lot hallelujah
[32:00] going down into sodom then you have to
[32:02] go down to the sodom and to fight
[32:03] take lot back and then resist those
[32:05] kings he had to go through all that
[32:08] because what was he doing it was forming
[32:10] him into the father of faith
[32:15] and god constantly does those things in
[32:18] the scripture
[32:19] that it looks it sometimes it looks
[32:21] ridiculous
[32:22] it's like lord why would you do that
[32:24] he's forming you into the image of his
[32:26] mind that great picture that he took
[32:29] before the foundation of the world and
[32:32] you look at how he did it
[32:33] church you think about this you know the
[32:36] bible says
[32:37] moses refused to be called the son of
[32:40] pharaoh's daughter
[32:42] church what reason did he have
[32:46] to refuse to be identified with them
[32:48] those
[32:49] people were nothing but good to him
[32:54] are we talking about the same moses
[32:56] think about it
[32:57] moses was abandoned in a river
[33:02] he was found harelia by someone uh
[33:05] who was the the daughter of the pharaoh
[33:10] riches upon riches and he was raised in
[33:13] a palace
[33:14] he had the best food the best teaching
[33:16] the best of the best
[33:18] so what reason would he ever have to say
[33:20] i don't want to be identified with y'all
[33:24] what was it it was god putting
[33:27] everything in place
[33:29] moses had to experience hollywood the
[33:32] greatness of what life could
[33:34] hardly give him only to get to a place
[33:36] to reject it and to see that what god
[33:38] had for him was greater
[33:41] hallelujah think about it i want you to
[33:44] don't take this lightly pharaoh of um
[33:47] moses was next in line to be pharaoh
[33:53] to run the world they have anything he'd
[33:56] ever want but then he got to a place
[33:58] where he was dissatisfied
[34:00] because he saw something that made him
[34:03] twitch
[34:05] he was at the right place at the right
[34:07] time
[34:08] according to god moses next in line
[34:12] saw an egyptian taken beaten on a
[34:15] hebrew and moses saw it in that moment
[34:18] in that moment his feelings started to
[34:20] change
[34:21] what was happening the picture of god
[34:23] was now coming into place
[34:25] hallelujah he wasn't there to be a
[34:27] pharaoh he was there to be a deliverer
[34:30] hallelujah so god allowed him to go
[34:32] through all that to get to that place
[34:34] now he didn't start as a bunch of
[34:36] peaches and roses
[34:37] holy he had that desire and that desire
[34:40] put him on the run
[34:45] that desire harley made him lose
[34:47] fellowship hollywood with his sisters
[34:49] and his brothers
[34:50] that desire made him leave home leave
[34:53] the palace leave
[34:54] everything that he ever known but that
[34:56] desire was the calling of god
[35:00] and sometimes we wonder why we go
[35:03] through certain things
[35:04] it's it's god being awakening inside of
[35:07] us
[35:07] so we have to be in a place where we
[35:09] seem distraught
[35:10] or confused but it's god in that moment
[35:13] taking full control of our life
[35:18] and in a time when moses didn't know
[35:20] whether he was coming or he was going
[35:22] he was right in the intentional plans of
[35:24] god
[35:25] because hallelujah the burning bush
[35:28] wasn't in egypt it was on the back side
[35:30] of the hill
[35:33] and it wasn't there in 40 years it was
[35:36] there 40 years later
[35:39] so god working out his whole plan he had
[35:41] to have all this happen
[35:43] honestly he even had to meet a wife who
[35:45] was fiery
[35:52] he didn't understand what he was getting
[35:53] into when he saw that pretty woman at
[35:56] the well
[35:57] you probably oh my she's nice and then
[35:59] one day she cut off some skins
[36:02] bloody husband to me but look even the
[36:06] prophet god said moses had a temple
[36:08] but god hallelujah used sappora to deal
[36:11] with that temper
[36:13] now sometimes i ain't telling you to be
[36:14] a certain way with your husband
[36:18] what i'm saying is for moses she was the
[36:20] best that he could ever have
[36:22] heard and in those moments hardly god
[36:25] was working on him
[36:27] becoming who he was in his mind
[36:30] are you with me church in church you
[36:32] think about it from there
[36:33] everything in moses life it played out
[36:36] not his way
[36:37] but god's way because moses didn't
[36:39] understand what he was going through he
[36:41] kept running to god saying lord why me
[36:43] why
[36:44] i don't listen not on that and god begin
[36:46] to remind him
[36:47] of his purpose what i love about god
[36:50] you can't see what he can see
[36:54] hallelujah
[36:58] oh my church sometimes i feel broke as a
[37:01] stick
[37:02] but i have to realize i can't see what
[37:04] god can think
[37:06] oh oh my when you stand sometimes in
[37:10] need and
[37:11] your finances are troubled and different
[37:12] things god is basically saying
[37:14] i got you right where i want you so you
[37:16] can pray
[37:18] and when i love god he's always working
[37:20] on both ends you just have to be doing
[37:22] what you're supposed to do on your end
[37:24] hallelujah church and when you look at
[37:26] it hallelujah
[37:27] you look at the grace of god and you
[37:30] look at the fees that moses
[37:32] went through in all his life and he kept
[37:34] going to god and said lord
[37:36] why me why does even at the first
[37:38] sounding of god
[37:39] putting that picture in motion moses
[37:42] rejected it
[37:44] he said i heard the cry of my people
[37:46] moses am i in the book
[37:49] am i in the bible church he said i've
[37:51] heard the crime of my people
[37:52] and i've come down and i'm
[37:56] sending you moses god said he come down
[37:59] but he said to moses where was god going
[38:01] to be
[38:02] and moses think about that
[38:07] against his will god is saying i'm gonna
[38:10] step inside of you
[38:12] and i'm gonna deliver my people using
[38:14] you
[38:15] but look god has to elevate our thinking
[38:20] even like right now some of you may be
[38:23] sitting here saying
[38:24] hmm this is this is all right this is
[38:27] nice
[38:28] hmm it's it's a little warm in here but
[38:32] you know i'm comfortable those are not
[38:35] the right thoughts
[38:36] the thoughts you should be having is
[38:38] lord speak to me
[38:41] lord i have certain needs certain
[38:43] situations in my life and god
[38:45] see i love to say lord if you are god
[38:48] do what you've always done hallelujah
[38:51] because you can't change if you've
[38:53] always done a thing
[38:54] a certain way you have to remain that
[38:56] way and now you look church
[38:58] and you see moses now he's in a place
[39:01] hallelujah
[39:02] where he comes to god god says moses i'm
[39:04] going to send you
[39:05] moses is now saying god i can't talk
[39:08] because of zappora
[39:11] see sapporo was put in the picture to
[39:15] humble moses
[39:16] to take away some of that anger change
[39:18] this whole statute
[39:20] change his whole being to the way the
[39:22] bible says
[39:23] there'd never be another man as meek as
[39:26] moses
[39:28] why so sisters you have a place in that
[39:31] man's life
[39:37] he might can't see it but god does
[39:40] hallelujah and you think about the
[39:42] church now he's now used to a place
[39:44] hallelujah where he comes before god and
[39:47] now he's making
[39:48] all his excuses and you know what church
[39:50] that takes me to jeremiah 29 don't get
[39:52] nervous i'm about to close
[39:55] you text me to jerry of jeremiah 29 the
[39:58] bible says god says
[39:59] for i know the plans i have concerning
[40:02] thee
[40:03] holy what i love about that god says
[40:06] thoughts of peace
[40:07] and not of evil if you got
[40:10] trouble in your life hallelujah just
[40:13] keep standing
[40:14] keep going keep pressing because it has
[40:16] to turn out to be peace
[40:17] because that's the only thing god sees
[40:20] when he sees you
[40:24] hallelujah but now
[40:27] moses comes before god he's like lord
[40:31] i i i just can't talk and god has a hand
[40:35] for everything
[40:36] who made your mouth
[40:39] am i in the book that's what he's doing
[40:42] most moses trying to get out of it he's
[40:43] making excuses
[40:44] see god has a foul he knows he knows
[40:47] what your mouth is supposed to say
[40:49] so now he's standing there before god
[40:51] making every excuse he said god i can't
[40:53] talk
[40:53] he says hey who made your mouth and
[40:56] mostly i can't do this i can't just and
[40:58] moses and god says moses i'm sick of it
[41:02] and then god elevates his thinking
[41:05] and he tells moses he looks moses
[41:07] straight in his face he says moses
[41:10] moses got every excuse i can't talk i
[41:11] can't do this i can't
[41:13] he says moses you be god
[41:16] and let aaron be your prophet
[41:20] he elevated the whole scene
[41:24] moses is just thinking you know i'm just
[41:27] a random i'm just a regular
[41:28] ordinary man that can't talk and god
[41:30] comes to moses and tell moses
[41:32] you be me and let aaron be you
[41:37] whoa go ahead you be god to the people
[41:41] and let aaron be your prophet and then
[41:43] moses comes back down
[41:44] and you go to pharaoh he says let my
[41:46] people go
[41:47] who's talking out of him god
[41:51] that's all he's trying to do church he's
[41:54] trying to get us in an
[41:55] intentional place where he can live out
[41:58] of us
[42:04] but we have to see the blessing in the
[42:07] things we go through
[42:09] you know before i close i love talking
[42:11] about joseph
[42:13] and we know the life of joseph it was a
[42:15] very hard life
[42:16] but god had a picture of joseph he had a
[42:19] foul
[42:20] and you know from that beginning joseph
[42:23] was being used of god
[42:25] he was loved of his father and hated of
[42:26] his brother hallelujah
[42:28] but that was god's plan
[42:32] some of you might be the only ones in
[42:33] your family that's in this message
[42:35] you know that's god's plan
[42:39] oh i took away your misery just now
[42:43] oh lord i don't think i can hold on
[42:45] anymore
[42:46] my sisters won't fellowship with me god
[42:49] is intentional
[42:51] oh lord i'm the only brother in my house
[42:55] send me some fellowship
[43:00] god uses all these things for a deeper
[43:04] in-depth connection with him hallelujah
[43:08] and now you look at it joseph here his
[43:11] brothers are jealous of him
[43:12] because his father loves him amen
[43:16] but you know what jealousy wasn't good
[43:18] enough he had to turn to hatred
[43:23] and god allowed it you know where to
[43:25] turn the hatred
[43:27] one day hey man i like saying this
[43:30] one day isaac got inspired and said i'm
[43:34] gonna make my son a quota many colors
[43:37] and not only am i gonna give him this
[43:39] coat i'm going to give it to him in
[43:40] front of all his brothers
[43:44] and they already already feeling the
[43:46] certain way daddy like him more than he
[43:48] like me
[43:48] and now holly god has inspired the
[43:51] father
[43:52] to bless his son in front of all his
[43:54] brothers and you know he gave
[43:56] he gave joseph that coat joseph put that
[43:58] coat on like a ric flair robe
[44:01] and he turned around and spit around in
[44:03] that roll
[44:04] dun dun dun dun dun dun
[44:10] his brothers looked at him with hatred
[44:13] with envy simply because
[44:16] his father loved him why why would god
[44:19] allow that
[44:20] because it there's a caravan coming from
[44:22] egypt and joseph had to be in the pit
[44:29] he wasn't going to get the egypt on his
[44:31] own he had to get there as a slave
[44:33] oh my
[44:37] my think about it church the picture of
[44:40] god
[44:40] the intentional works of god god took
[44:43] him out of a loving home
[44:45] that he could experience poverty and
[44:47] slavery to get him in position
[44:52] oh my
[44:55] oh brother aaron i thought we were going
[44:57] to jump and shout
[45:01] we are when you can realize
[45:04] everything is working for your good
[45:09] now he has to fight the spirit of
[45:11] jealousy and his jealousy turned into
[45:13] hatred
[45:14] so much hatred to a couple of his
[45:15] brothers wanting to kill him
[45:18] but he's a reuben or simeon one of them
[45:20] said no we're gonna kill him
[45:22] we're just gonna put him in the pit why
[45:25] because the caravan was coming
[45:26] holly church in in in that moment
[45:29] one of the darkest days of his life he
[45:32] didn't even realize
[45:33] that he was typing out christ
[45:38] whoa what about you hallelujah
[45:42] you may even realize in the in the
[45:44] darkest day of your life
[45:46] in the most strenuous trial ever you're
[45:48] a type of christ
[45:50] god is using that intentionally to show
[45:53] the world
[45:53] that he is still on the earth but he's
[45:56] in a body of believers
[46:00] and he didn't even realize in that
[46:02] moment him being sold into slavery
[46:04] hallelujah
[46:05] he was typing out what judas would do to
[46:08] christ many many years to come
[46:12] holy so that's why we either have to
[46:15] complain
[46:15] when we go through stuff we ought to say
[46:17] lord give me more grace
[46:21] now church he's thrown in the pit
[46:23] hallelujah soul into slavery
[46:25] a type of christ now he gets in the part
[46:28] of his house
[46:29] and his wife hallelujah she says joseph
[46:32] come live with me
[46:34] and y'all know that wasn't just one time
[46:38] she was chasing that man and now
[46:41] he has to have the strength hallelujah
[46:43] to fight against lust hallelujah
[46:46] holy and make it stand why would god
[46:49] take him out of a good
[46:51] stable secure loving home and now
[46:54] put him in a place hungry where
[46:56] everything about him is being tested
[47:00] there is a greater picture
[47:05] and now
[47:08] the bible doesn't say what her name is
[47:11] but now she tells a lie on them
[47:15] just like they did christ
[47:20] and now he's thrown in jail
[47:24] we get in jail he's mistreated
[47:27] but what i love about joseph in the
[47:30] midst of
[47:30] all the things he's going through he did
[47:33] not lose his connection with god
[47:37] even though hallelujah he false
[47:41] he fought hatred and jealousy the gift
[47:43] of god kept working in his life
[47:46] even though he was thrown in the pit the
[47:48] gift of god kept working in his life
[47:50] even though he was in part of his house
[47:52] getting lied on
[47:53] fighting lust demons the gift of god was
[47:56] still working in his life
[47:57] now church he's abandoned he's in the
[47:59] jailhouse
[48:01] he's in the darkest place he could ever
[48:03] be in jail
[48:05] and innocent
[48:09] and the gift of god is still working in
[48:12] his life
[48:14] we don't have any excuses
[48:19] again i said we ought to throw our hands
[48:21] up and say thank you lord
[48:24] thank you lord i'm able to see it thank
[48:27] you lord i'm able to go through it
[48:28] hallelujah
[48:30] remember he put scripture in there
[48:31] specifically for us
[48:33] to to them that overcome her will i
[48:36] grant to sit with me in my throne
[48:39] why would he put it in there if there's
[48:41] not a people that's going to overcome
[48:44] so what we ought to be saying is i'm
[48:45] that one that's going to overcome
[48:48] hallelujah no matter what i'm going
[48:49] through i'm that one that's going to
[48:51] overcome
[48:52] no matter what they say about my message
[48:54] i'm that one that's going to overcome
[48:57] hallelujah now the baker and the butler
[49:01] they come down
[49:02] holly why did they have to go do what
[49:04] they went through because joseph was
[49:05] down there
[49:08] and you may not realize it sometimes
[49:12] people go through things just so they
[49:14] can meet you
[49:18] because you have the answer oh
[49:22] that one made me want to shout right
[49:24] then
[49:26] in my darkest moment in my darkest time
[49:29] you mean to tell me
[49:31] god is using me to be the answer for
[49:33] somebody else's need
[49:40] you may be thinking lord why me why am i
[49:42] going through this
[49:43] why because somebody is watching you
[49:46] somebody is watching you they're
[49:48] watching how you're going through it and
[49:49] it's by your life
[49:51] they're going to get victory
[49:56] amen oh yeah
[49:59] oh my church i feel the holy spirit
[50:02] moving
[50:05] i want you to take it personal today the
[50:08] things that you're going to
[50:10] going through god is shaping and molding
[50:12] us
[50:13] that we can be here in christ instead
[50:17] well we can be his hands but we can be
[50:19] his feet we can be his voice
[50:21] and in that moment hell yeah the bacon
[50:24] and the butler come down
[50:25] hallelujah with dreams that they've had
[50:27] and now joseph is standing there
[50:29] and joseph interprets their dreams why
[50:31] because there was a great
[50:32] there was going to be a greater dream
[50:34] that needed to be interpreted
[50:36] hallelujah he was the answer in that
[50:39] dark dark
[50:40] moment everything that happened up until
[50:42] that point
[50:43] was intentional it was the hand of god
[50:47] oh my
[50:48] oh my and i love joseph's response
[50:51] hallelujah
[50:52] look church as time went on and and
[50:55] whichever one the bigger the butler
[50:56] one died and one got restored then
[50:58] pharaoh has a dream
[51:01] and the servant says i remember my
[51:04] mistake there's a man in your jailhouse
[51:07] wow not one of your one of your scholars
[51:10] or
[51:10] one of your great men no there's a man
[51:13] in your jailhouse
[51:14] a man that's fought jealousy a man
[51:16] that's fought lies
[51:18] a man that's fought depression but he
[51:19] has the gift of god in his life
[51:21] to give you the answer you've been
[51:23] looking for
[51:26] even though he's lost his family her
[51:29] church
[51:30] think about this in order for job in
[51:33] order for joseph
[51:34] to get in place he had to lose his
[51:36] fellowship with his family
[51:42] he didn't get a chance to grow up
[51:43] hallelujah with his brothers loving on
[51:45] him
[51:46] church he was going through this journey
[51:48] for 17 years
[51:56] and we go through something two years
[52:02] ain't even been two years yet but these
[52:05] were talking
[52:06] about this pandemic stuff even been two
[52:09] years yet and people quit in church
[52:12] won't even come back they've become
[52:15] online ministers
[52:17] streamers they love those comments they
[52:20] love those kind of church services
[52:22] because at home you can pause me
[52:26] oh no now i don't like what he's saying
[52:29] honey hit fast forward
[52:33] you can make me dance the way you want
[52:35] me to dance
[52:39] if you just get sick of me you can
[52:41] delete me
[52:46] see we love to have control but god is
[52:49] the only one that's going to have
[52:51] control
[52:54] hallelujah and let me say this brother
[52:56] aaron didn't ask me to say this
[52:58] but let me say this normally when when
[53:00] when new churches develop
[53:02] you have to come hallelujah that there
[53:04] is a vision
[53:06] there's a vision huddle that god has
[53:08] given a man
[53:10] hollywood to start a work now what you
[53:12] have to do
[53:13] you have to surrender to that vision
[53:17] you can't come from your house or
[53:19] whatever you say well i want to do this
[53:20] and i want to do that no see if it's
[53:22] okay with the vision that's already
[53:24] being purchased
[53:27] see we have to come as help us of one
[53:29] another amen that way things work in
[53:31] harmony
[53:32] and we can see it intentionally but if
[53:35] you come
[53:36] with the mindset that i'm gonna i'm
[53:38] gonna do this i'm gonna do that because
[53:40] if the way i wanna do it you might mess
[53:41] up the whole
[53:42] vision because you think about the
[53:45] intentional
[53:46] the intentional uh god hallelujah how
[53:49] did
[53:50] rebecca meet isaac she met isaac
[53:53] because she fulfilled the vision of
[53:56] eliza
[53:58] oh yeah and he was intentional
[54:02] by what he prayed the next god he said a
[54:06] woman that's not even gonna give me
[54:07] something to drink
[54:08] but she's going to give me drink and all
[54:10] my camels honey
[54:12] and by her fulfilling her elijah's
[54:15] vision
[54:16] he knew that she was the one for isaac
[54:20] church and we are a people who are
[54:22] fulfilling the vision
[54:24] of malachi 4.
[54:27] or the vision of jesus christ should i
[54:29] say holy
[54:31] because whatever vision eliezer had he
[54:34] got from abraham
[54:36] hallelujah abraham told him i want you
[54:39] to go down here
[54:40] and get my son uh our wife hallelujah so
[54:43] everything
[54:43] elies had belonged to abraham the gifts
[54:47] he had
[54:47] the gold the jewelry he belonged to
[54:49] abraham his confirmation
[54:52] all of it it belonged to abraham
[54:54] everything about elijah
[54:55] came from abraham everything about
[54:58] brother brother
[54:58] came from god
[55:02] none of it was his own and what i love
[55:05] about the whole situation
[55:07] when you truly realize the picture
[55:10] remember when the seven when the seven
[55:12] angels were seen and everybody was so
[55:14] excited
[55:15] about the angels and this and that god
[55:17] came down he said turn the picture
[55:20] yo looking at the wrong vein this is not
[55:23] about my angels this is about me
[55:26] and you made them turn the picture and
[55:28] once you turned the picture of the
[55:29] angels
[55:30] you saw the head of christ inside holy
[55:33] and that's what we ought to see in this
[55:35] message
[55:36] we have to be able to see christ inside
[55:38] of it
[55:40] let's turn the picture it's not about
[55:42] great preachers and great men and great
[55:44] buildings
[55:44] it's all about christ that's the picture
[55:49] hallelujah church
[55:54] when we think about where we are right
[55:57] now
[55:58] let me let me get the time
[56:03] when we think about where we are there's
[56:06] a lot of things that have taken place
[56:08] over the past couple years
[56:11] but ask yourself what is god trying to
[56:13] show you
[56:15] hallelujah even in this pandemic what is
[56:17] god trying to show
[56:19] see i asked myself that same question i
[56:21] believe god is trying to show us
[56:23] if we really are what we say we are hell
[56:26] yeah
[56:27] because some people have disappeared
[56:31] never to be seen again oh my
[56:34] and what what caused that to happen
[56:36] pandemic
[56:38] the bible says whatever can be shook
[56:41] we'll be shaking
[56:43] so god allows these things to shake the
[56:45] tree
[56:46] now you got to ask yourself do you
[56:48] belong or don't you belong
[56:51] and only you can answer that question
[56:53] you know as a sister in my church
[56:56] if if you you think about jobs and all
[56:59] this stuff
[56:59] system my church at the beginning of the
[57:02] year she had got a new job
[57:04] but the pandemic stuff was still going
[57:05] on she had got sick
[57:07] she didn't get cobra but she got i think
[57:09] she had double pneumonia
[57:11] she had a new job and she couldn't work
[57:14] but she had a new job
[57:17] so when it came time to get paid she was
[57:20] thinking oh lord lord jesus
[57:22] i need another stimulus but you know
[57:25] what
[57:27] god was intentional god wanted to show
[57:29] her
[57:30] no matter what's taking place if i do
[57:32] something for you nobody can't take it
[57:34] church she had worked that job in three
[57:37] months
[57:39] but she's getting a check every week
[57:44] do you serve that god
[57:48] hallelujah another friend of mine

[57:54] are those people

[1:02:35] end he said it means that much to you
[1:02:37] say yeah they say okay
[1:02:38] shut the door that's what we're gonna do
[1:02:40] they say when
[1:02:41] when on your church days when church

[1:02:45] we want you to go ahead and go to church
[1:02:48] but this is what we want you to do
[1:02:49] don't clock out we're going to pay you
[1:02:52] to go to church
[1:02:56] hallelujah that's the god we serve
[1:02:59] church when was the last time he was
[1:03:01] paid to go to church
[1:03:08] [Applause]
[1:03:10] oh my jesus is real
[1:03:14] he said look we want you we're gonna you
[1:03:16] go in the church don't clock out
[1:03:18] when church is over you just come on
[1:03:20] back
[1:03:22] they saying don't tell nobody we doing
[1:03:23] this for you
[1:03:26] but he couldn't help but try to believe
[1:03:28] us why because somebody
[1:03:30] else may have been in a position like
[1:03:31] that that if they stand
[1:03:33] god will take care of the rest of it
[1:03:36] hallelujah
[1:03:37] that's the god we serve because he has a
[1:03:38] whole picture in that picture hardly
[1:03:41] god wanted that brother in church
[1:03:43] because in that moment hallelujah
[1:03:45] he meant something to that congregation
[1:03:49] church if we try the lord the lord will
[1:03:51] show himself to be mighty and strong
[1:03:54] listen i'm going to read this one more
[1:03:55] thing i'm trying to get out the way
[1:03:57] harley listen
[1:04:03] this isn't a reproach for the cause of
[1:04:05] the word he's saying god sets the time
[1:04:08] and has a purpose for everything that he
[1:04:10] does
[1:04:11] there is nothing happens just
[1:04:13] accordingly
[1:04:15] to those who love the lord
[1:04:18] and are called according oh let me read
[1:04:20] that again there is nothing happens
[1:04:23] just accidentally to those who love the
[1:04:26] lord
[1:04:26] and are called according to his calling
[1:04:30] see
[1:04:31] so today is not an accident
[1:04:37] you say oh i just felt led to come to
[1:04:38] church no
[1:04:40] you are a part of this picture you're
[1:04:43] supposed to be here
[1:04:45] now what you got to do is figure out why
[1:04:48] because god's not going to tell us
[1:04:50] everything he wants us to seek his face
[1:04:53] hallelujah so if you're here maybe god
[1:04:55] is trying to get you to
[1:04:56] have a closer walk like i said me
[1:04:59] getting cancer
[1:05:00] was all about god bringing up a
[1:05:02] revelation of jehovah rapha
[1:05:06] and it took cancer to bring out a
[1:05:08] revelation of god as a healer
[1:05:10] that was already there inside of me
[1:05:11] because remember everything that's in
[1:05:13] that seed is already in it
[1:05:17] so the revelation of healing was already
[1:05:19] there in me
[1:05:20] it just took a situation of need that it
[1:05:24] may come out
[1:05:25] hallelujah and it took that holy
[1:05:28] that situation of cancer hallelujah to
[1:05:31] bring out that god
[1:05:32] is a divine healer and you know what
[1:05:34] once he does it it's forever
[1:05:38] i don't believe in that remission and
[1:05:41] come back and all this
[1:05:42] no if god does it it's forever
[1:05:46] and that's been been over 25 years ago
[1:05:49] and i've
[1:05:50] never had another reoccurrence
[1:05:53] why because i believe god now there have
[1:05:56] been other demons that have come and
[1:05:57] tried
[1:05:58] diabetes said he's coming he's tried and
[1:06:00] failed
[1:06:03] type 1 and type 2 have failed
[1:06:06] why because he's the same god hallelujah
[1:06:11] i went to the daughter and they said he
[1:06:12] got diabetes i said no i don't
[1:06:15] she said yes you do you got diabetes i
[1:06:16] said no i don't
[1:06:18] the nurse got mad with me just just gone
[1:06:20] just thrown in the other room
[1:06:23] you know when they mad with you they
[1:06:24] start mistreating you
[1:06:26] she's supposed to say okay mr d's we
[1:06:28] want to put you in this other room
[1:06:29] around here this and that
[1:06:31] your glucose levels and this guy's gone
[1:06:33] in the other room
[1:06:36] i ain't my fault i'm a believer
[1:06:40] so i get in the other room and i'm
[1:06:43] waiting on the doctor
[1:06:44] doctor comes in and she's like hey mr
[1:06:47] diggs how you doing
[1:06:48] everybody all right i'm about to close
[1:06:53] hey mr dicks how you doing i said i'm
[1:06:55] doing pretty good now this may be
[1:06:57] this may be a challenge for some of you
[1:06:59] who have who have proclaimed to have
[1:07:01] diabetes
[1:07:03] i'm telling you you can be delivered of
[1:07:05] it today
[1:07:08] because i'm a witness that has tried to
[1:07:11] come upon me
[1:07:13] twice and probably many other times that
[1:07:16] i didn't accept
[1:07:17] holly but i'm gonna show you how it's
[1:07:20] working honey
[1:07:21] so i'll get into the doctor i'm gonna
[1:07:22] show you how the doctors are thinking
[1:07:24] i get in there and she said you got
[1:07:26] diabetes and glucose and sugar levels
[1:07:28] and all those
[1:07:29] look my sugar levels aren't supposed to
[1:07:30] be high i'm a christian
[1:07:32] i'm sweet
[1:07:36] hallelujah ain't nothing sour and salty
[1:07:39] about me
[1:07:39] i'm sweet my levels aren't supposed to
[1:07:41] be high
[1:07:44] hallelujah but now church i mean that
[1:07:46] doctor comes he says how you doing mr
[1:07:47] diggs
[1:07:48] i said i'm doing quite lovely she said
[1:07:51] okay that's good and she's looking
[1:07:52] around see everything going good
[1:07:53] everything's going fine now keep in mind
[1:07:55] the nurse didn't told me i had diabetes
[1:07:58] and now the doctor comes in and she
[1:07:59] pulls out the chart she looks at the
[1:08:01] chocolate
[1:08:01] whoa right here it shows you guys i'm
[1:08:04] saying no no i don't i ain't got no
[1:08:05] diabetes so yeah mr diggs right here on
[1:08:07] your chart
[1:08:08] i say i do not have diabetes i'm talking
[1:08:11] to a doctor
[1:08:15] she says okay she said that's what we're
[1:08:18] going to do
[1:08:19] we're going to take a blood test y'all
[1:08:22] know in my spirit
[1:08:23] i was doing like this
[1:08:27] yeah wow
[1:08:31] wow glory well i'm sitting on the table
[1:08:34] like this
[1:08:38] but in my spirit she told me
[1:08:42] she gonna give me a diagnosis based upon
[1:08:44] my blood
[1:08:49] i was having a praise dance inside
[1:08:53] because the last time i know i was
[1:08:55] covered by the blood
[1:08:57] i'm under the blood hollering and when
[1:08:59] god sees me hallelujah
[1:09:01] he don't see diabetes all he sees is the
[1:09:03] sacrifice of jesus christ so if you're
[1:09:06] going to judge me by that
[1:09:07] i'm already ill hallelujah
[1:09:12] so she goes get the little machine walks
[1:09:14] out the room and i'm trying to keep my
[1:09:16] composure
[1:09:17] you know i want to shout real bad you
[1:09:19] know
[1:09:20] cause i'm like hey man she's gonna judge
[1:09:21] me by the blood thank you lord
[1:09:23] see god will give you signs that you
[1:09:25] know that you've already won
[1:09:27] hallelujah and now she comes in and she
[1:09:29] pricks my finger
[1:09:30] and the little machine goes she looks at
[1:09:33] she says
[1:09:37] this is strange how can you have
[1:09:41] high glucose levels over here but right
[1:09:44] here according to your test
[1:09:46] everything is normal now she started
[1:09:49] asking me questions like i'm a doctor
[1:09:54] how can this happen i'm like i don't
[1:09:56] know i'm here
[1:09:59] i'm gonna tell you what was happening
[1:10:01] over here
[1:10:02] in the nurse's station it was a demon
[1:10:05] trying to get in
[1:10:07] and he was seen he was seen over here by
[1:10:09] the nurse
[1:10:10] and now he's trying to get into my
[1:10:11] thoughts and be accepted over here
[1:10:14] but you know what happened i spoke the
[1:10:16] word so by the time i got over here
[1:10:18] he was already dealt with you speak the
[1:10:21] word hallelujah
[1:10:22] don't worry about the rest god will take
[1:10:24] care of the rest holy
[1:10:25] the prophet of god said before is
[1:10:28] manifested in your body you have to
[1:10:30] receive it as a thought first
[1:10:34] and be honest most of us that have went
[1:10:36] to the doctor and got diagnosis
[1:10:38] we felt fine we didn't even know nothing
[1:10:40] was happening until they told us
[1:10:44] so why are you going to accept something
[1:10:45] that you knew nothing about
[1:10:48] don't get me going down this healing
[1:10:49] line we'll be here all day
[1:10:53] but now church she started asking me
[1:10:55] questions about this about that
[1:10:56] and i'm like
[1:10:59] well how can this happen your blood
[1:11:01] levels are fine and sugar over here no
[1:11:03] snacks
[1:11:04] i just don't understand it and i said
[1:11:07] something
[1:11:08] she said what did you eat last night
[1:11:14] i said sweet tea and chocolate chip
[1:11:16] cookies
[1:11:21] that's what she saw and you know what
[1:11:24] she agrees with me
[1:11:26] she says yeah that's what it is
[1:11:29] yeah it sometimes it shows up in your
[1:11:32] system like that
[1:11:33] now this is a good check listen to me
[1:11:35] carefully
[1:11:37] she agrees with me what she saw over
[1:11:40] here
[1:11:40] the nurse saw was sweet tea
[1:11:44] and chocolate chip cookies so why did
[1:11:47] they change the name of it to diabetes
[1:11:50] why didn't she call it chocolate chip
[1:11:53] and t
[1:11:57] that's all the devil does whatever's
[1:12:00] affecting you is something you've
[1:12:01] accepted
[1:12:02] in your mind to manifest in your body
[1:12:05] hallelujah and in my case it was
[1:12:08] chocolate chips
[1:12:09] and tea so my thing is
[1:12:12] why didn't you call it that why did you
[1:12:14] put another name on it
[1:12:17] to easily get you to accept it because
[1:12:19] you now you feel real stupid you say i
[1:12:21] got tea and cookies in my body
[1:12:28] am i right but that's just how simple it
[1:12:34] is
[1:12:36] and we all know that our body it
[1:12:38] produces a certain level of sugar
[1:12:41] it produces a certain level of insulin
[1:12:42] and all these things
[1:12:44] so what makes it gets to a place to make
[1:12:46] you sick
[1:12:48] your mind the way you
[1:12:51] accept it dictates how powerful it'll be
[1:12:59] as far as i'm concerned tea and cookies
[1:13:02] they never had no power over me
[1:13:07] i tell it when i'm a drink and i tell
[1:13:09] her what i'm gonna eat hallelujah
[1:13:12] and that's what i'm telling you when you
[1:13:14] go to the doctor be careful what you
[1:13:16] accept
[1:13:17] because sometimes you're accepting their
[1:13:20] picture
[1:13:21] not your picture you're not accepting
[1:13:24] god's picture hardly
[1:13:25] because god says i'm close musicians
[1:13:27] come i'm closing god says
[1:13:29] i know the thoughts i have concerning
[1:13:30] you thoughts of peace
[1:13:32] and not of evil so why are you going to
[1:13:35] accept thoughts that god is not having
[1:13:36] of you
[1:13:38] everything on this side holly in this
[1:13:41] flesh
[1:13:42] is the dark room we're in the dark room
[1:13:45] we have to be developed but once we're
[1:13:47] developed you will see the original
[1:13:49] picture
[1:13:50] that was taken let me read this and
[1:13:52] i'mma close
[1:13:55] sorry if i'm going too long he said
[1:13:58] there's nothing happens
[1:14:00] just accidentally to those who love the
[1:14:02] lord and are called according to his
[1:14:04] calling
[1:14:04] seek we are predestinated and everything
[1:14:08] works just right
[1:14:09] for that because he cannot lie somebody
[1:14:12] say amen
[1:14:13] if god said you're healed hallelujah by
[1:14:16] the stripes of calvary cross
[1:14:18] take it as that he cannot lie hallelujah
[1:14:22] he said he said and he said that was so
[1:14:25] that everything has its time it's season
[1:14:29] and it has its way and god is behind
[1:14:32] every move can you say amen to that
[1:14:35] church
[1:14:36] you might be in a tight spot but god is
[1:14:38] behind that tight spot
[1:14:40] oh yeah sometimes you know one of my
[1:14:42] greatest battle is finances
[1:14:44] because i live by faith and you know the
[1:14:46] devil always like to tell me you know he
[1:14:48] got this he got that
[1:14:49] you need to go out and get a job and
[1:14:50] then some kind of way god sends a
[1:14:52] blessing
[1:14:54] just to keep me encouraged and you know
[1:14:56] sometimes he uses some of you holly what
[1:14:58] is he doing
[1:14:59] he's touching your heart to touch my
[1:15:01] heart hallelujah
[1:15:02] you know and i'm gonna probably deal
[1:15:04] with this wednesday but you know what is
[1:15:06] happening
[1:15:06] we are god's attributes so in those
[1:15:09] moments holy
[1:15:10] where i am in need and god touches your
[1:15:12] heart to bless my need
[1:15:14] what are you you are operating that
[1:15:16] jehovah jarrah whoa
[1:15:20] oh yeah because we are his attributes
[1:15:24] when you lay your hands on somebody to
[1:15:25] pray and they get healed
[1:15:27] that's the attribute of jehovah raphae
[1:15:30] god is using you
[1:15:33] let me stop
[1:15:41] and god sometimes you think that
[1:15:43] everything is going wrong
[1:15:46] it's up to us those things are put upon
[1:15:49] us
[1:15:50] trials and wonderings it's testing
[1:15:53] to see how we will react on an
[1:15:56] action
[1:15:59] so god is intentional
[1:16:03] your life may be in a mess right now
[1:16:06] but what is that to god you don't think
[1:16:09] god can clear up a mess
[1:16:11] remember when he first created his
[1:16:13] creation
[1:16:14] it was without form and it was void but
[1:16:18] in the midst of all that chaos life was
[1:16:20] laying there on the earth
[1:16:22] but it took the earth to feel the
[1:16:25] presence and brewing of god
[1:16:27] for life to come forward so a lot of
[1:16:30] times
[1:16:31] our life is in a mode of chaos but all
[1:16:34] god is trying to do is
[1:16:35] get us to a place where we'll let him
[1:16:37] brood over us
[1:16:39] and then the realness of who you really
[1:16:41] are will come forward
[1:16:43] that's what it took for moses that's
[1:16:45] what it took for for job
[1:16:46] that's what it took for joshua
[1:16:48] hallelujah all joshua went through
[1:16:50] was just to get him to the king's seat
[1:16:55] fighting lying fighting jealousy
[1:16:57] fighting the dungeon
[1:16:58] fighting being forgot about all that
[1:17:00] stuff just so he can get to the throne
[1:17:03] and then what i love about it everybody
[1:17:05] that ever did him wrong
[1:17:07] god put him back in his hands can y'all
[1:17:10] imagine potiphar's wife
[1:17:12] every time she saw joseph
[1:17:17] because she knew she lied but she's in
[1:17:20] his hands now
[1:17:21] let me say it like this god will never
[1:17:24] put it back in your hands if you don't
[1:17:25] have the character
[1:17:27] holy he put his he put his his his
[1:17:30] jealous
[1:17:31] his jealous hating brothers back in his
[1:17:34] hand
[1:17:36] every last one of them back in his hand
[1:17:38] and he could have did anything with him
[1:17:40] and they would have never known who he
[1:17:42] was
[1:17:44] but he recognized it was the picture of
[1:17:47] god
[1:17:47] he recognized it was intentional
[1:17:52] [Music]
[1:17:54] i want to read one more scripture before
[1:17:55] i close
[1:17:57] genesis chapter 50.
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:22] listen when it was all said and done
[1:18:26] you look at joseph's attitude towards
[1:18:28] his brothers
[1:18:29] his brothers didn't even know that they
[1:18:31] were being used by god
[1:18:34] god was using hatred he was using
[1:18:37] jealousy
[1:18:38] he was using lies he was losing the
[1:18:40] dungeon of the jailhouse
[1:18:41] god was using all that just to get his
[1:18:43] servant to a place
[1:18:45] where he could reign you really tell me
[1:18:48] god could use the lying spirit he sure
[1:18:50] can
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:53] but it would all boil down to it came
[1:18:54] down to listen to jobs
[1:18:56] joseph's attitude right here in um
[1:19:02] verse 19.
[1:19:05] now he's talking to his brothers and
[1:19:07] joseph said unto them
[1:19:08] fear not for am i not
[1:19:12] for am i in the place of god
[1:19:16] see he looked at everything he went
[1:19:18] through and his brothers
[1:19:19] they were still scheming
[1:19:23] before he told them that they came to
[1:19:25] him and said hey daddy said don't kill
[1:19:27] us
[1:19:28] they were lying before he died he said
[1:19:31] don't kill us he didn't say that
[1:19:34] but they were so afraid by what they did
[1:19:36] they're still
[1:19:37] pleading for their life not even
[1:19:39] realizing that it was the hand of god
[1:19:41] all along
[1:19:44] and now church in that position joseph
[1:19:47] looks at his brothers
[1:19:48] and he tells them fear not am i not
[1:19:51] where god wants me to be
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:55] church don't look at what happened
[1:19:58] before you got here
[1:20:00] look at that you're here say oh brothers
[1:20:04] i went through this journey with the
[1:20:06] message of this journey of that journey
[1:20:07] don't worry about that it took all that
[1:20:10] to get you here
[1:20:11] and now that you hear the question you
[1:20:13] have to ask yourself
[1:20:14] am i not in the place of god
[1:20:18] you know i've gone through hard trials
[1:20:20] troublesome times
[1:20:21] but church hallelujah god has begun
[1:20:23] always be
[1:20:24] showing his hand that he's with me
[1:20:26] honestly
[1:20:27] so when we when they actually ask you
[1:20:29] questions like how you doing
[1:20:31] am i not in the place of god
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:36] it may look like it's tough it may look
[1:20:38] like it's rough but am i not in the
[1:20:40] place of god
[1:20:41] because if you can't say that you're
[1:20:42] saying the devil is in control
[1:20:46] and he's not in control god is in
[1:20:48] control
[1:20:49] church i got a lot of things i'm i got a
[1:20:51] lot of things i'm praying about
[1:20:53] i'm looking for god to do and sometimes
[1:20:54] it looks like i'm starting over
[1:20:56] but what i have to do if i'm starting
[1:20:58] over i have to reflect
[1:20:59] at what god has already done and if he's
[1:21:02] already done it that time
[1:21:03] he can do it again hallelujah he don't
[1:21:06] stop
[1:21:06] god never gets weary hallelujah he just
[1:21:09] wants you to believe
[1:21:10] and let me say like this if you're going
[1:21:12] down roads you've already conquered
[1:21:14] that means god is making you stronger
[1:21:17] hallelujah so just keep going through it
[1:21:21] and keep standing by the grace of god
