TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Psalms 42:7 and it's um when you begin to read it you'll understand that brother brandham talked about this a lot it's a very strange scripture but the way brother brandham brought it out that's something amazing he says the Deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy water spouts all the way all thy waves and Billows are gone over me 1 John 3:2 it says belov loved now we are the sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now I just want us to emphasize now we are the sons of God we don't know what we're going to be we know that there's there's more but now we are the sons of God Heavenly Father father we ask for a just a special blessing father that your Holy Spirit may come down and just speak to us father allow us to just get closer to you a greater relationship a greater revelation of you father we ask that you bless each and every person every open heart father that you just give us the words of Life In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated now brother brandham he uses scripture in 427 and he said that if there's a a deep calling if there is a deep calling there is a deep to respond so the the Scripture it can go many ways if you you look at commentaries or if you listen to um theologians they'll go many ways of of Affliction and all of that but brother brandham he took this scripture and he said if there is a deep calling there is something else a deep two respon respond my my title today is a deep to respond and if we look throughout the seven Church ages and throughout the the ages of the Bible God has been calling out a people God has been calling out in every single age he'll call out a certain group and if you look at the Bible you'll see the world sometimes it's in total chaos but he'll call one person out of it and there's going to be one person that is going to respond now to the whole people to all of the world it looks like God is calling out the whole world for God so loved the whole world that he gave his only only begotten son that's truth we can take that to the bank we can take that and we could say God loves the whole world but whosoever believeth that is the Deep to respond that is a special elect people that are going to take that call every single age there was one person there was eight people there was five people there was two out of two million that would heed to that call that God would give and the people would step up out of millions of people and they say Lord here I am and a lot of times like whenever I'm reading the book of Jeremiah it it's a very sad book The Lamentations in the book of Jeremiah because you have this they call him the weeping prophet and Jeremiah he goes and he pleads with these people day after day after day deep calling to the deep deep calling it there was there was an eternal God talking to carnal people saying if you guys just repent everything will be all right if you guys just turn from the gods you guys are serving break down your Idols everything will be all right but if you don't judgment is coming judgment is coming and they would get so angry that they that his very own people would torture this poor man Jeremiah and and you look throughout the whole Bible or or throughout the whole scripture of Jeremiah and Lamentations nobody heeded to the call of Jeremiah now sometimes you look at that you'll look at the modern day and you say man that's an unsuccessful Pastor there that's an unsuccess ful Prophet there because nobody listened to him but in though that group and and and even though they had to go through that there was people that were elected in that group you had Ezekiel you had Daniel you had um um mesach Shadrach and abedo that had to go through that judgment and had to go through there and flourish to show that there was Christians out even though there was judgment and there was sin all over them yet there was an elect right there so even though it looks like man well God called and there's very few that answer this that's God's provided way that there there was elected people from the beginning before the beginning before there was any Earth we were already in him so even though it looks unsuccessful God says I got the people that I wanted the whole time that's amazing now when brother Brenham would speak about this deep color to the Deep he would always um give reference of a few stories one would be about the out when he was out in the wilderness he would talk about how he began to see Wilderness and he would see the elk and he would hear one calling out and then he would hear the other then he would begin to hear the wolves and then he would hear another calling out on the other side of the canyon on the other side of the Wilderness he would see the earth I mean the rainbow and he would say one part of the rainbow was calling out to the other and then he he gave reference to another story he says this in the message and he says this in many messages but here in um hearing recognizing acting on the word of God he says like the little boy that always that I always speak of eating erasers off pencils and the pedal off the bicycle he needed sulfur and as long as there was something there to Crave for sulfur there had to be sulfur somewhere first made there had to be a sulfur before he had a crave and it the sulfur projected him then he went back to the sulfur very simple very simple thing or or or example brother brandom gave but I begin to think about how when God he poured out judgment or or or he he casts out his judgment to Adam and Eve he told him in Genesis 3:19 he started to talk to Adam and he began to give the curses and he told Adam from dust you are and dust you shall return because we were born Out of the Dust We were born so our bodies are made of the ground it's made out of all those things so brother Bram he would always say we're made up of 16 elements and it's because in reality we're made up of six elements and then the rest I think um 11 more consist around us and we need those so the first one is is oxygen carbon hydrogen nitrogen calcium phosphorus which uh constitute 90% of the body's Mass so we need those six elements in order to live in order for the life to function we need all of that and with the additional trace of elements like sulfur potassium sodium chlorine magnesium making up the remaining of the small percentage necessary for Life function so we need all of this for us to live and so you start thinking about this child he was born and he was made out of the Dust so he needed the Dust In order to live so the very thing that God cursed cuz he said cursed be the ground the very thing that he cursed that's what our bodies are craving the very thing that he said cursed be the ground now we're calling out for it so it's a deep calling to the Deep brother brandham he said the boy was calling out for sulfur and you know what it made that boy do he didn't know that he was craving sulfur brother BR said his body projected him to the sulfur so we saw a eraser maybe he's going to be a scientist I we don't know maybe he was going to be a astronaut we don't know but at that moment people said whoa this kid maybe he's not going to live up to a lot cuz he's chewing on a pedal he's he's acting strange maybe people are looking at him schoolmates seen seeing them eat see him eat their erasers and they saying he's acting weird the the pedal his parents are like something's wrong with this kid he's acting weird he's chewing on pedals but they didn't know that his body was projecting him back to the dust that there was a deep calling to the deep inside of him but on the outside he's acting weird on the outside he he's acting strange but there's something in him that that is calling out and and we have to think about it that that in our bodies that's we're consistent of that the top four atoms in us are the top four atoms that are in the universe so the top four atoms that we have it in the whole entire universe so the whole thing fell the whole thing is gone so i' I've heard scientists say that we are Stardust and that boy his body was calling out for sulfur brother brand he says in the things that are to be and I'm going to reference a lot the things that are to be because if you listen oh man what a beautiful message this basically a in depth look at the Deep callers to the Deep he didn't name it that but you look at it he's talking about what we were what we are and what this condition how it this condition is dictated by what we are and what we're going to be and he says this he says now this old world Must Fall why it's cursed it's in sin because it come through sex they come through disobedience in the beginning we was born here through sex through the fall it must go right back to the same way to the fall so no matter what we're born you know beautiful babies but we're all born through a curse and we all have to go back to that curse so even in our bodies a deep is calling to the Deep where where where brother bham he also says and the thinking man's filter he says my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow for down in there is life and life connects with life amen and sin connects with sin sin is so hypocritical that it thinks that it is safe when it isn't but I like what he says sin connects with sin so we were born in sin we we have this this nature in us and we're calling out for it when we're born there's just something calling out because we were born of these things of these elements he has the right Satan has the right to Shadow over us he has the right to go and say I'm going to attach myself to him because he he did all of that he was able to deceive Eve he was able to allow Adam to sin so that he could say now I have the right to try to enter into this body to try to enter this body with sickness to try to make people um um depressed to try to make people go into sinful situations he has the right now um I I know I said this um on Wednesday but brother bam says this on question and answers he says and the life of a cabber has been taken out but the nature of the culber is still sticky see and we see it until and and it will be until this new life has fully developed out of the ground and raised up again so so it's not going to leave until our life is fully developed when it comes forth then there was no more cabber but wheat but wheat but while it's here on Earth the out of the earth and cabber it is still sticky because it's got the nature inside of of it wheat or or or it says but it's got nature the nature on the inside of it of Wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're you're in likeness of Christ and all sin has gone from you and that's why we're talking about the other time that that's why this body cannot serve the Lord that's why we can't self self modify and try to say I'm going to be a Christian because in Corinthians 15:50 it says now I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God why because sin is attached to sin dust has to go back to dust it's calling back to the dust it's calling us us that's why after a while whenever we grow up there's going to be a point even though we're eating all the dust we're eating the tomatoes we're eating all the good stuff it's just going to bring us back say hey come on you're coming back to the Grave with me you're going to decompose why because we are part of it and just like the sin that is attached to us through the serpent seed it's calling us sin is calling it's calling this flesh brother Bram he says in things that are to be he says now we find out this life holds all kinds of evils so therefore the life that is to come won't have it praise God Amen this life is going to have a lot of evils but the life that is to come won't have it this one has lust sickness death because what is it it's it's not the house that he's gone to prepare this is a pest house how many knows what a pest house is the congregation says amen sure well that's what we're living in a pest house is where they put all the disease people well that's just the um what sin has done to us put us in an Earthly pest house where you they wouldn't let anyone else come in um in the pest house because there's all kinds of germs flying around and the people will take these germs and be sick themselves because sin brought us into the devil's pest house this is UN making me understand that we're living miles under the condition God called us to be God has made us for a condition made us to be perfect made us to be an original but now we're in a deficient because the kid if you think about the child he was deficient of sulfur so he was deficient out of something so it caused them to act strange it caused them to be sick when somebody's anemic they're weak they can't move they lost all their strength in their blood why because they they've lost the iron that they need in their lives so what happens is is they put him in an anemic condition we are in a condition that is horrible brother Bram says we're living miles under the condition God made us to be brother Bram he says on the that day on Calvary he began to explain to his buddy because his buddy is like are we going to go squirrel hunting on the millennium are we going to do this and are we going to do that and and he had to explain that our mentality here is going to be completely different I remember when I was a kid I was like man am I going to be able to drink a Coke am I going to be able to do this and it's just such a carnal way of thinking we can't help it because that's all we know this is our perspective we're in the pest house so this is all we see but God's like oh just wait he says I said Charlie what if I can convince you that one time you was a hog and you had um raised to a higher being to a high being uh to a being a human being would you ever go back or would you ever go want to go back and enjoy the pleasures of a hog said no I said see you'd be so much higher than a hog you're human you never want to be a hog anymore I said now multiply that by 10,000 and that's what you'll be when you're changed from here to what you will be you'll never want to be human again so where is our condition we are deficient of something every true child of God has an eternal element in them that third defici on this boy was deficient of sulfur we're deficient of something out there so now we're in a horrible condition we're in an anemic condition and something bodies are calling out for dust but our souls are calling out for an eternal a seventh element and it's calling back to us it doesn't come from the earth it comes from God and we know many times brother Brenham says God had us in his thinking before there was anything we were there praising the Lord we were an attribute of God we are a peace of God so we were already had he he had us in his mind we were the forn knowledge thought of him and then we come here we go into this this condition where we're deficient from his spirit and then we begin to act weird we begin to act strange see everybody everybody's okay with their condition the world's going to be okay with sin we began to cry out that's why I'm sure everyone here has a testimony of thirsting for God whether you were raised in a church or you raised out of a church something began to call you out amen you could have been in the worst place and then I I remember just to give you a little testimony or little context to what I'm saying is I remember I was in a bad condition I'm not going to tell you my whole story but I was in a bad condition yet a song in church would go into my heart and it' start beginning to replay in my heart and I say why why is church music in my like why do I why am I singing church music when I want to be big bad Eli big bad elizer what was it it was a deep calling to a deep and then when you begin to stagger to church brother brandham said when somebody staggers to church and begins to give their heart to the Lord they begin to act strange then their co-workers begin to say man you changed what's wrong talking about God again were we smoking a week ago weren't we cussing w we talking about these things and now you're you're talking about God what is it they're crying out for something what are they doing they're chewing on the pedal and everybody thinks they're acting strange because now they want to pray before they eat their food in front of everybody now now now they want to open their Bible whenever they're in break at at work man this guy never did that what is he doing he's crazy they're eating they're chewing on that bicycle pedal a lot of times we don't know what we're calling out for a lot of times we're just we just want the surface level of who Jesus is oh he died on the cross not knowing the deepness and the profoundness of who God is that he has a word that will be revealed to you and it will begin to change you that there was a prophet here to reveal the word and it won't only bring us to a Justified or Sanctified or filled with the Holy Ghost condition but it will bring us all the way to a rapturing condition all the way to where you step into a new body whoa what is it it's you you begin to but you don't know that you need that sometimes the new Christian doesn't know they need that so they come to church and they say let me hear what the pastor has to say let me hear what the minister has to say Let me let me sing some songs when we come to church we're chewing on that pedal but God there is a Eternal God calling from a deep calling from the deep and there you are responding back to that deep and sometimes people are going to call you crazy but let them why are you wearing those that kind of clothes you're oldfashioned I don't care why why why are you acting that way now I don't care because whatever is calling you is a is a more of a reality than this place this Place brother bam says is the negative this place is just a shadow this place is is full of sin it's a pest house and I don't want nothing to do with it if I can I will allow the Lord to change me so that I could be a living EP pistol so that I can be an alien and show people hey there's another land out there hey there's another place you guys are looking for UFOs and aliens here I am I'm from another place I'm From Another Dimension I'm from another another thing called eternity outside of of everything that you think is real outside of the ambition of money outside of the ambition of all these things that the world is saying this is reality then here we come saying God is real God sent a prophet there is a word that will change you from the condition that you're in amen you look a little anemic you look a little deficient from God woo and then you see them begin to light have you ever seen somebody from from a sinful condition and then them giving their heart to the lord it's beautiful brother brandham he says when a woman is pregnant he says no matter how foul she is there's a spirit that allows her to Glow it glows because there's a spirit around her brother brenon says that that's how our new birth is that there's a spirit around us that there's a glow life is about to happen praise God he brother Bram says in thinking man's filter he says notice the word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them that are going to be lost there's a beautiful quote I don't have it here but he says you weren't seed when you gave your heart to the Lord you didn't become seed when you were you were born again you always were seed you were always there now you are just calling back to Eternity deep calling to the deep I I was remembered remembering how brother Brandon painted a picture of the Samaritan woman at the well it's a beautiful picture how he how and he would explain how low down she was and you look at her body you look at her her face you would say oh this person there is no hope I don't know if anybody's ever said that about you I don't know if maybe some of us have said that about somebody else but that's who her condition was brother brandham he says there was this little in ill- famed prostitute her first life up there was black as could be so you look at her her life was full of sin could be from her life she was a prostitute but secondly down was just a little bit of light that's the seed brothers that's the seed he said because she had a conception of what the the Messiah would be now the the soul declares two things Faith or unbelief now you have these Pharisees that were brother bham says they were white you look at their life you could not put one thing on their life you couldn't put one finger on their life and say oh they did that they were perfect so their first everything you would see was light but just as God went down to her and he saw a little bit of light he went down to the Pharisees and he saw Blackness he saw Blackness he continues on in the voice of the sign he says that little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body and the Pharisees with a pure body and a defiled heart it condemned one and it saves the other what was the difference when God when God manifested himself through Jesus Christ the word they said ah he's a devil we're not accepting that word brother brandham said why was there light in her because she had a conception of what the Messiah would be she was watching she was waiting she was she was deficient she was she had a culber nature she was full of sin in this pest house didn't know what to do she lived in sin until the word came and she said that's what I need that's what I'm deficient on that that's what this little light called my soul called the seed has been crying out for brother brandom says that God puts a thirst in every single person in the world that's amazing but then you'll see people that use that god-given thirst go out to the bars and start drinking start smoking start lusting start doing all those things but that's what what's causing it it's a god-given thirst all of those vile things all of those evil things are being caused because there is a God get they're looking for something to satisfy them they're eating bicycle pedals they're figuring out what to do they need something to satisfy them but it'll never help because they're looking at the wrong place until one day they'll stagger in and they'll heal the hear the word of God and something will change and then say that's what I was deficient on that's what was calling me he says he stood between them here in the when their eyes were open and they knew him he said he stood between them when he did the Messiah sign showed them who he was and everything it blackened the whole thing of those Pharisees they went back to Blackness because why cuz they had nothing down here to anchor on they called him be alub a devil and the light they did have went out and they perished in it here is this woman black and sin as she could be but in her heart she knew that the Messiah would be she know what sign he would show and as soon as he said to her dot dot dot what did he say I'm he she says well I know she had a conception well I know when they say they told me this and and whenever I was able to get close enough to hear them they said this and they said this and they said this and finally they said one would come and do all these things he says I'm he that's all she needed she changed from a defiled person and she got the vitamins she got the word she got the eternal life that she needed and she stepped into the life that God has called us to be in amazing and a lot of times what is that you have to go deep in enough with the Lord amen you you you have to go and you have to talk to him until you see him amen you don't see just a prophet you don't just see see first of all I remember hearing a tremendous Minister say how she went to him and first she saw a man what how did she confront him well you being a Jew and I'm a Samaritan we shouldn't have no dealings together that was her first revelation that was her first revelation getting in contact with the word then he be to talk she said I think you're a prophet what was it a greater Revelation and you know what praise God for that Revelation people say wow that man William brandom what a prophet but brothers that's as far as they go man you're a prophet amen and you know what that's a great great Revelation because if you hear other people talk about brother Brown they don't don't have nice things to say so if you hear a person that's in another denomination or some other great Network or whatever they're in they'll say oh he's a prophet we say wow but that's as far as they go man he did wonderful things but when he began to talk about certain things that's when I stopped that's as far as they went but she stayed amen she kept listening to the word she kept asking what did when when Phillip when Philip told Nathaniel he said come and see there's a man where's he from Nazareth uh has anything good come from Nazareth that's his first revelation he said what come and see if you got any doubts if there's something that you need come get a deeper look get a deeper look in Christ amen and she began to ask him and ask him for first he was a man that she all she could see was race then she saw a prophet then as she continued to talk he said I am he and she saw the manifested word in front of her and she said haven't this guy said everything about my life all he said was about her adulterous life but when he she said it she said he knows everything about me this is him this is God this is the word same thing with with Peter who do men say well some say you're this some say you're that who do you say that I am you're the Christ that's when we get we begin to get vitamins we start begin to walk and step into the very body we're going to be changed into the very word that's going to change our bodies we're stepping into yes amazing brother bradam he says in in God who is rich in Mercy he says for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of your life that is in you now had to be with God before there well he before he can come become material here on Earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of your hair you would have he know all about you he know everything about us what is it the Deep calling to the Deep God calling from eternity and every time we answer Heaven and Earth get closer what does it say whenever a a a person in sin converts or repents it says just like whenever a man he he lost his n or his H hundredth sheep he leaves the a 99 and he goes and he gets that one and when he gets them there's a party and he says that's the same thing when God recovers a sinner what Heavens begin to rejoice when you gave your heart to the Lord whether it was in your couch whether it was in church wherever it might have been it could have been a quiet place insignificant nobody cares nobody knows yet there was a party in heaven when you accepted him all of Heaven reacted and said they're finally in she's finally heard the call he finally heard the call and Heaven and Earth gets a little bit of closer brother bam says when you receive when um he says when this body receives the spirit of God when you receive the Holy Spirit The Immortal Life inside you it throws the body into subjection to God hallelujah that's he he that's born of God do not commit sin he cannot sin and and and brother bradam he began to talk about here in in the Great Commission he starts talking about the the rainbow and the elk and the the wolf and he says you know David says when the Deep call it to the deep deep began calling to the deep I heard an old bull ALK bugle he says the storm separated them so there was something that separated us from us and our creator something separated us he said through the mass of blowing the timber falling the herd had broke had got broke up they were bugling to one another to what to come back together amen the mate of the wolf was calling let's come back together the eye was calling to the rainbow let's come back to together the spirit calling to the church let's come back together let's unite God was there praise God you know what's the amazing thing about this story that there was a bugling out there and a bugling there could have been miles the the howling could have been miles but as The Bull Al begin to cry out have you heard a bu a bugle from a bull Al beautiful thing I remember my kids heard it they're like who's screaming it's just a very intense sound he began to cry out what does the mate do she doesn't sit there and like oh there he is let me call back now she says I heard it this way let me go go through here let me go up through this Valley let me go through here then she would hear it again and then she would hear him and what was it they were getting closer they were getting closer then she would hear the word again and she say I'm going to turn here I'm going to go down through here I have to go up this mountain and whenever she would hear it again she got closer and closer and closer until what the two deeps finally met one day as we hear that call we're looking we're hearing we're becoming we're getting closer and closer to God until one day the two deeps will meet today we are Sons and Daughters of God but one day we will be like him the Bible says yesen we are not like him yet completely but one day we shall see him as he is and we will be just like him we are listening to the call of our of our mate we are listening to the call of the spirit and as we do that we're getting closer and what is that call let's come back together amen you were never you were never meant to be in this pest house you were never meant to be sick and in this condition but I'm going to call you but I'm going to call and I'm going to call and I'm going to call and as we listen to that call we are being transformed into that word we are being made into that image that's beautiful I'm going to reread this this quote he says like that little boy that I always speak of eating erasers and pencils and the pedal off the bicycle he needed sulfur and as long as there was something to Crave for sulfur there had to be sulfur somewhere first made there had to be sulfur before he had the Crave and it the sulfur projected him he went back to the sulfur brothers sisters it's going to project you you don't know why you act a certain way it's going to project your body why am I like this because there's a call there's a deep calling to the Deep brother brandham he says in things that are to be he says how much more abler is he to get he's a Creator now how able is he to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live there's something in US calls to live and there's something in us that calls to do right then God will call somebody on the platform or in the Pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why see it show knows you then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to whereas he's gone to prepare you got to be a real word bride of Christ see what we think just coming to church is just to come to church eating that bicycle pedal but he says it's needed for your Heavenly Home the reason why we come out and we cry and we say Lord take these things away from me Lord allow me to get closer hearing our our pastor preach these messages to allow us to get better and greater Christians what is it it's needed for our Heavenly Home a deep calling making you do strange things and you're responding just like that that the slave that they said man he acts different yes what was making him act different everybody was was sad and oppressed why they were in a horrible condition but then you see this man and he's working like like he's getting paid to do it and the guy said I want I want that slave and he said no he's not for sale what is he is he the boss is do you feed him better he says no he was a prince what caused him to act different his past condition what caused him to act different because he knew who he came from why do we act different not only our past not only for knowledge but election and predestination because we know where we came from it makes us act like the way we act because we know where we came from and we know where we're going amen we know wherever we came from we're going back in Romans 8:30 as I'm beginning to close he says moreover did he predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified praise God predestinate it pre means before this is a strange word pre means before destined means an end an an expected end so what God did in the beginning he already wrote your End Amen in the beginning he already knew everything about you no wonder Jesus can say I am the Alpha and the Omega I'm the beginning and the end so even when you're Justified even when you're a green tree you are already perfect in God's eyes God already has an expected end for you God already has a place prepared he already has your steps ready for you to walk before you even even before we give our hearts to the Lord he's already got an expected end he's already got something for us if you like to stand with me and the musician it would come up brother brandom Walked In Christ is the mystery of God revealed how when God rose from the dead or Jesus rose from the dead his spirit and his body was separated but as his Spirit begin to ascend his body be to react to the Ascension of his spirit and his body and his Spirit began to come together until it became one and it was a glorified body brother Bram says that the body the church was lay there and as the word began to cry out throughout the seven Church ages the body through the word begin to raise up amen and he says one day that body and the head will unite together one one more time it will unite and he says the more the word was revealed the body begin to be alive I love how brother brother Aaron's been bringing out about Pentecost and the the Methodist how they stopped see when justification came that was the allotted word for their day so when God gave it to them they could only go to a Justified state that was their Revelation no higher they could not go any higher why that was their portion and that was the body going up a little then sanctification a great Revelation came and the body of Christ went up a little higher and they said praise God they rose up to another Heights another levels Pentecost came and the gifts of the spirits came but that's as far as they could go but a as as it goes finally The Head and the body have to meet that's this message today because there is no other message out there there's nothing else to raise us up this word that we have today is going to change your mortal body amen amen it's going to bring you to your mate so so we're not expecting another age we're not expecting uh some other thing we're expecting for the two Elks to meet the two wolves to meet the bride and her husband am and it's happening right now do you believe thaten that it's no more negative it's no more Shadows the word is doing that now and some they're just a little behind some are still coming some are still giving their heart to the Lord some are on other levels but it's all just coming together as the bride praise God as our brother would like to come let us bow our heads Heavenly Father oh God your word is greater than anything Lord because it's just not printed words on a piece of paper it's not just a book lord but when we take it with faith that word comes alive that word change our mortal bodies God we have everything we need for the next step I believe we already there we're we're standing there the invisible Union of the bride of Christ and as our pastor has been saying it's the fruits that we'll see the fruits manifested of that Union oh God that's why we act strange that's why we act the way we act we're different because we're calling out for something that nobody else cares for cuz they don't have that element father we're crying out for more of you father all those that are thir thirsting all those that need more of you Lord I ask that you fill their heart's desire and more fill them fill their families bless them wherever they go Lord allow us to manifest your word father until that day we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen
