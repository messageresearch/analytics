TRANSCRIPT
========================================
5: 27 and after these things he went forth this is Jesus and saw a Publican named Levi that would be Matthew who is a tax collector Publican is another phrase for those that collected taxes sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow me and he left all rose up and followed him and Levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with him but their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and Sinners and Jesus answered said unto them they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick I came not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance and when we looked at this passage earlier he said what meaneth the saying I would have mercy and so there's uh We've looked at some of this already in the past so you could take your seat as we've already teed up uh the title at this point and God hidden in profanity and the title slide uh shows a picture of that calling of Matthew we'll come back to it here in a moment but I wanted to share um a uh uh something that Preston shared with me and I thought this would fit really well today um and it's I don't if you recognize this Calvin and Hobbs anybody like Calvin and Hobbs anybody okay I got a few hand okay we I hope that's not my biggest amen of the day but uh it shows Calvin in front of a mirror with his underwear on saying made and God's Own image yes sir right just kind of calling back to how God created a man and then hob saying God must have a goofy sense of humor and it looks at it as I pondered it is here's Calvin looking in the mirror and seing himself for what God Said in other words that God has made Man In His Image so he's saying yes I'm made in God's image but then notice what Hobbs does is he doesn't dispute that fact but he says well then if you're made in God's image and seeing how it's expressed in Calvin he's saying God must have a goofy sense of humor and I know immediately we're thinking the goofy sense of humor is to is to make uh maybe we might think well that's Calvin looks goofy but it's his sense of humor that's goofy which we I think we can all attest to an agree and so Hobbs is make drawing a really good conclusion that if there's something in Calvin's nature and he's in the image of God then that must be God's nature as well you catch that that if you're in the image of God and you're expressing his nature it's not so much just how you look alone but that character and life that's inside of it and so now I know I'll be flooded with everyone's favorite cartoons that relate to and comic strips that relate to this feel free my inbox is open it's not full yet you can just send them my way but I thought that was a really good expression of what's in my heart in talking about art and I believe that comic strips in some ways are considered art there's certainly some artwork involved but as we look at this uh subject of God hidden in profanity that word is going to jump out at us thinking um that it causes us to be bristle a little bit that word hidden um and maybe for others maybe the word profanity causes us to bristle and so I want to start with Ezekiel CH 44: 23 to catch uh my scriptural use of the word profanity or what would be profane we say profanity and we immediately think about maybe dirty words or words that were not allowed to speak and in speaking them these curse words that's considered profanity and yet it is that's how we would describe words but let's go all the way back to what the meaning would be in its beginning in Ezekiel 44:23 and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean now there's many scriptures that relate to this I was going through the Bible last week and just trying to find every instance where uh profane and profanity and profaning um is mentioned in scripture to get a scriptural full scriptural understanding of what this word would mean and it's the people are to be taught by the priesthood the difference so you must be able to distinguish between those things that are holy and those things that are profane and we can already kind of see what this refers to because it says discern between clean and unclean and here the holy uh would refer to even in the Hebrew uh language and the meaning here separateness or sacredness so there'd be you'd be taught the difference between things that are sacred and things that are not sacred so here we learn things that are sacred or something that is consecrated and set aside if something is holy or sacred it is dedicated is consecrated and the profane means in the atmology even the use of the word it's connected with sand and so if we talk about sand we say well this is just dirt it's common it's everywhere it's under our feet and so if something is profane it's common or before we start leaning too much into this idea that it's perverted but it's Unholy and in being Unholy it means it's not separate or sacred or set aside or dedicated and so therefore the word is used and it's used in scripture in such a way to where something becomes polluted or defiled or sick so it's used in that sense that this has been profaned it's made dirty or the sacredness has been taken away from it or it's sick or defiled but in that wording you have the sacred or the holy and I want to use the word sacred versus or against or opposed to different from the profane it's something the sacred is something that has an intrinsic Holiness it has some quality to it that makes it set apart and dedicated and then those without that intrinsic Holiness like the dirt itself and sand you'd say well there's nothing special about the ground there's nothing special about the dirt and so that would just be common it would be profane but then a temple or uh the something that is Sanctified and set aside for a particular use you'd say that's sacred we've set that apart and this concept runs deep in the Old Testament uh with especially within the law and the children of Israel it's something that's very uh pronounced in their Worship in their ideology their belief and as God laid these things out in the scripture in Leviticus 19:12 and I think this will really help us understand what I mean by profane or profanity says and you shall not swear by my name falsely neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God I am the Lord to profane the name of God and I really just uh Focus as much as you possibly can today as much as is within you but to profane the name of God what is meant here and what the scripture is saying is don't swear by his name falsely and don't profane the name of God in other words use it in a casual manner this is what it's uh suggesting or what it's telling you not to do because both diminish the sacredness and the reverence of the name that if you swear by his name and don't keep it it's like well what value is there in the name if you're going to lie Li in the name of God if you're going to lie swearing by God then it's not sacred there's no consequence it's not something to be revered and then if you just Pro you profane it by just using it in a casual manner you're making it common or is the Bible is saying profane so profanity in the context of the Old Testament involves treating something that is sacred as ordinary that if something is sacred or special or set apart or has some uh particular designation and use but then you defile it or you pollute it or you make it sick or weaken it uh you can do so just by treating it as ordinary or ignoring its intrinsic separateness or its uniqueness or its specialness Ezekiel chap 22: 26 it says her priests have violated my law so this kind of circles back uh to where we were in Ezekiel and have profaned mine holy things how have they profaned holy things they put no difference between the holy and profane neither have they showed difference between the clean and the unclean lot of layers there there's a lot that we could draw on what's clean what's not clean avoid this and and and you can do this he says and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and I am profaned among them now a day there's nothing special about a day necessarily sometimes we say what what's your uh favorite day well everyone that ends in why and so you kind they're all there they're just days right right but God set aside the Sabbath and he said set it aside and keep it make it holy so although the sun's going to rise on that day and set on that day just like it is any other day this is a day where you ought to regard it as sacred and not do certain things and do other things and moderate your behavior based upon the fact that I want you to regard this 24-hour period from the Sundown uh uh and to regarded as they would look at a day to regard it in a very special way amen and as they have profaned the Sabbath it's by hiding their eyes for my Sabbath how have they done that they've treated the Sabbath just like any other day doesn't me on the Sabbath is when they they got drunk or they smoked weed or or they popped some pills or they they cursed their neighbor it's not it didn't require some sort of overt uh hostile act against sanctity but just treat it like like any other day they have profaned holy things things that are sacred and they don't regard there's no difference between the holy and the profane and the example is they hid their eyes from the Sabbath that I told them to keep sacred Holiness in the Hebrew kadosa is setting things apart or elevating them distinguishing them in contrast with the everyday or the common The Cho where you that the Cho is the the root for profane and profan in these different places there's several different conjugations of that so the holy are set apart and they're contrasted by just the everyday or common in the New Testament even the profane the babos is that which is accessible in the New Testament when the word profane is used it comes from a word that means uh lawful or legal to walk upon to trot upon so when we think of something that is uh maybe this is a way of thinking about it that uh when you see a no trespassing sign that is set aside and designated for particular use to those who privately own it for their own use but then when you see something that's public it's legal to walk upon it or to access it so the difference between holy and profane even in the New Testament is something that is accessible something that is legal to walk upon so it would be unhallowed or common a public place is what's meant by the word now when you begin to think about things that can be defiled and and how profane becomes a dirty word is when you take something that is sacred and you make it common you strip it of its Holiness so when a profane is used in the New Testament can speak of something unclean or un Unholy or defiled and those are words that it's translated to and all refer to things that are common ordinary or part of everyday life even in the Latin profus means outside of the temple if it's profane it's outside of the temple that that sacred Place something set aside for specific use something that is to represent Holiness and Purity profan is something outside of the sanctuary or just something that's not part of religious practice things that we do that we do is a part of honoring the Lord and serving God and uh uh a prayer a dedication things that we would say these things are holy these things are right these things are pure but then there's other things we do that are not a part of our religious practice they're just profane and common so think of it in this way when we say God hidden in profanity we're looking at the sacred God the Divine or deity Christ many different ways the word we could use that uh there's a lot of connections to the temple and those things we ministered on last year the house of the Lord a lot of that's going to make uh just be highlighted again today the sacred and the profane is those things which are spiritual or what we would believe to be religious Are Holy and those things that are ordinary common maybe even secular things that just just just human life now I want to use this as an example and I may be putting some people to sleep already and if I've already put you to sleep with that you might start snoring now I want to look at this from this perspective and I wouldn't share this if I didn't think it would help us but there are things within the within art and historically and just through generations there's this concept and this idea of sacred art and the purpose behind sacred art is it it's wanting to connect the one who's viewing the art The Observer with the Divine that it would be painted in such a way to where we're representing something that is sacred something that is Holy something that is divine and present it in a way that causes you to reverence it causes you to the representation not the painting itself but what is rep it represents and to think about it and to ponder it its greatness and to invoke this awe like the Grandeur of it it's so Grand and very in particular they wanted to Sacred artist to present an image that transcends just the monotony the mundane of everyday life wants to it it seeks to convey these deeper meanings and spiritual truths and I wanted to use some examples of this and this is a this particular example uh is a painting of Jesus Christ now we would look at it and we would recognize immediately maybe this is just symbolic and this is what sacred art was supposed to do it's not necessarily try to be uh real or very particular about how he actually looked but Ed symbolism and imagery to convey something holy or sacred and so you have the use of the Halo you have this golden book and I don't know what what this is but you find this in almost every single painting of Christ that blessing gesture and uh and this is to present to you a Christ figure that this is what he would look at and so you think oh the Halo the gold and obviously this particular painting has degraded through time but if you could imagine in its original richness how it would look and so sacred art would have different symbols or or uh elements to it of halos very pronounced extravagant Halos they're be gold backgrounds as you can seeart here there'd be certain symbolic colors and there'd be even this unnatural style a lot of times where it would uh and even unnatural proportions where the sacred are much larger and greater in proportion to other things uh this is another mural it's been degraded quite a bit but this is an example of that sacred art where Jesus here has this golden Halo and the background is gold it's to convey to you right off the bat when you look at it this just isn't some commoner this is somebody special and then you have profane art sacred art which is done in such a way to where it's not actually natural even in its representation but it wants to convey something Grand and greater than natural things and then here this would be a good example profane art anybody recognize the painting Potato Eaters by Van go it's one of his uh uh more famous paintings and what he was painting here is just common everyday Dutch people and there's nothing uh looking at this uh in some ways it's unsettling it's very dark there's not a lot of use of light but yet there's a great deal of light that follows falls on everything but it profane art is not art that is perverted or grotesque but just explores things of everyday life where it it looks at ordinary Human Experience just ordinary situations here's somebody here's a family sitting around in the evening eating potatoes and uh having dinner and drinking their tea this is this is just a common scene in everyday life as it would relate to even religious things here's a Rembrant painting of the taking down of Christ off of the Cross and doing this he uses light to convey the uh to give us some sense of what's happening and I can't remember here just exactly where he may have painted his face into this uh his self-portrait but this would be a rendering of something that we would say is scriptural uh uh and this isn't maybe a glorious scene this is the dead body of Jesus Christ being taken off the cross and it's presented kind of in a in a a natural way nothing added to it to make it seem more more glorious or more extravagant and there's not uh there's not these cherubs floating around there's not gold inlaid here and there's not these different proportions there's not a gigantic Halo behind his head his fingers aren't being held in a particular way this is just conveying the normal the ordinary of one dying and being taken off the cross I'm going to come back to that in Genesis 18: 27 just looking at this mundane profane Abraham answered and said behold now this is Genesis 18 is a uh so much uh deep things in this he's wanting to talk to God about uh this Angel God visiting him in the form of an man he wants to talk to him about those in Sodom and and don't destroy them and he says behold now I've taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which am but dust in ashes in other words I'm using my own words he's profane all he is he's saying is I'm entirely human there's nothing different about me that would set me apart from those in Sodom there's nothing different than me that would set me apart from lot there I am but dust and Ashes just like everyone else that's what is meant by the profane it's sand it's dust it's ashes in itself it doesn't seem to be anything special or sacred about it now especially during the time of Van go he's considered the father of modern art uh in in the 1800s but even backing up more there was a lot in the the Dutch Reformed Church they particularly uh pronounce these different things but the Reformation begin to bring a Great Divide in in the art in arts how Christ and Christianity was represented and how you would portray it in art and Luther and Calvin and you'll find in the history they banished paintings from churches they ban sculptures from churches and some as the Dutch reformed they been banned all paintings of Christ Mary God anything you were not to represent them in any way in any form uh in art and so the Catholic response was this and I read this from a historian that whenever Luther and Calvin and the Reformation begin to uh ban these paintings from churches and these sculptures and kind of change their focus away away from those things that kind cic Church said why don't we lean into it and they responded with a great outpouring of imagery ornament colors contrast and Theatrical Decor fit to Dazzle the believer and reaffirm the predominance of Rome wow I want you to I'm wanting to put it in this sense that this sacred art that was used to convey things that were unnatural and holy and the use of halos and gold and colors and proportions it was all meant to be sacred art this is sacred and art should be used to convey certain spiritual themes and it should cause people to set in awe and wonder and so their response was when the Dutch or when the Reformation comes instead of pulling back from those things in their churches and in their imagery they make it even more extravagant and so then sacred Dart comes to look like this and I don't know if you could see this very well but this is the uh this is the ceiling not the cistin chapel but this is a ceiling of a cathedral and this is the triumphal entry of Christ or the uh the Triumph in the Name of Christ and this is dramatic this the style that's used here is to convey some sense of what is happening all these different things there's this sacred style there's this Grandeur H H there's a great intensity when you look at this and it presents it in in a way where it is totally unnatural the proportions are unreasonable because you begin to look at it you're like how do I Orient myself with all these forms and their shapes and everywhere they where how they are laid out and this is in a church and look at this church here's the Triumph in the Name of Christ look at the gold look at the ornate uh uh uh handiwork it was all meant to convey a sense of awe power Grandeur to walk into place and say based upon what strikes my senses God must be in this place to roam the sacred were those things that were set apart for a holy purpose those things which are connected with the Divine so in their ideology say there's things that are sacred the church the altar the god Christ and so the profane to them well that just focus on focuses on as I use the word mundane matters these things that pertain just to the individual and it was those things which could be known solely by human sense when you look at that picture of the Triumph in the Name of Christ there's there's something Beyond yourself trying to figure out what's happening what would that feel like what would that look like what is being presented and so that's that's the sacred art but the profane you know the Prof a because we are profane the Bible says for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so 1 Corinthians 2:11 to me provides an opportunity to look at it scripturally and say the sacred is known by that sacred Spirit the Divine is known by a Divine Spirit the things of God are known because the spirit of God is made available or you have the spirit of God it's by the spirit of God that you can contact no apprehend and grasp spiritual Supernatural things if I could put it in these words to serve my purpose today in other words the profane was knowable through human experience we may not be Dutch we may not be potato Farmers we may have never sat down and had a meal of potatoes unless they were cut into Strings and deep fried but there's but yet we can look at a scene where people are sitting around a table eating and we can begin to know that's knowable that's something that we can grasp but the sacred is everything beyond what we can experience with our senses the sacred was to be things that strike us with awe and wonder one historian put it this way sacred images were were to convey theological subjects in a clear and unequivocal fashion and win over the viewer by appealing to the emotions now we're emotional creatures and that's the purpose of art really in any any setting whether it be a book whether it be TV whether movies you name it it wants to get some hook he wants to conjure up some sort of emotion and move the viewer The Listener the one that is taking it in and now Rome and sacred art maybe not just Rome but I want you to think more Catholicism and the church and denominationalism and those things and this false religion and how that they want sacred art and even to some art was to be used only for sacred purposes remember even the argument that the decay of of The Art of Lying is what allowed things to diminish and that art should lie as a way of entertaining us well the church is essentially doing the same thing but yet they are given artistic license to say we want the things that we cannot know we're we we we have to borrow language we have to borrow human thought and and these things so we want to use things that are Grand and Beyond the knowable to convey this sense of awe cause your emotions to be moved and in doing so it wins you over to believe this is God this is Holy and we may not be able to get to it today but Rome in this way was forcing a certain uh homogeneity where everything was homogeneous everything was the same and they would the art was to convey a certain Serenity and there was to use these soft edges these perfect features because it was wanting to move us by our emotions this is where art was for quite a some time enter Michelangelo macii de Caravaggio and he began to approach scriptural things and art in a way that was not commonly accepted that was we'll get into it a little bit it was a turnoff to religion and religious people here is a picture of David triumphing over Goliath David having cut off the head of Goliath he's a triumphant Victor but look at the look on his face some sense maybe a dissatisfaction and maybe a greater longing he's not triumphing he's not smiling he's he's not conquering he's not Victorious and this is kind of grotesque right uh there's no FID Angel for this slide I apologize but yet here is David triumphant with the head of Goliath in his hands and Caravaggio has painted himself as the head of Goliath he used his own self-portrait in this and this is something that when you look at it you're not think you're not inspired by Soft features and gold and Halos and you're not immediately moved if you weren't familiar with the story you'd be like what kind of repulsive art is this what kind of grotesque representation is this but he was conveying a scriptural story in a way that we could now begin to see and feel and understand what happened when David cut off the head of Goliath Beyond necessarily just reading it causes that scene to come to life a biographer of cavio wrote about cavio he was a thunderstroke there is Art before kagio and art after Caravaggio and they aren't the same thing the whole of Rembrandt's career is a response to the thunder strike of seeing caravaggio's art the argument is and some have put forth that vermier and de la Croy and Corb and and man they never exist without cajio and this is a pretty intense art lecture cavio broke down barriers between the sacred and the profane there was this movement in art and there was this uh maybe this maybe could be some Renaissance where you wanted to romanticize certain things and things were to be viewed in this fantasy and uh you wanted something Beyond yourself to be entertained by and he began to break that wall down where religious art was for this one purpose of conveying the sacred to strike the the the viewer to these these Grand emotions but now he's beginning to draw the paint these scenes where the sacred is confronting the profane and he's drawn to paint things in a way that wouldn't be hanging in a cathedral wasn't these soft edges and perfect features and his Works begin to push the boundaries of religious propriety and the response of the art community and the church and those H uh viewing the art considered it crew they considered it disrespectful because he depicted biblical figures in just ordinary form he stripped them of what would be the sacred imagery this devotional image where just by looking at the picture you immediately know oh this is uh this is Christ or this is something special this is Grand this is Holy and let me say this before I begin to show these slides so that you understand where I'm coming from from this there's an image of Christ that the church that sacred art was con vein that was so far beyond yourself you just were in awe the Halos the gold the imagery the chapel the the frescos those things were just so all inspiring that you saw it completely independent you couldn't rely anymore on your senses and Human Experience so it causes this Euphoria it caused some sense Beyond yourself and I know we've seen so much media and entertainment andmore it's really hard for us to imagine a feeling causing us to be like but just imagine you never seen a movie before just imagine just mundane everyday life and all the color you ever saw was in nature and then one day you look at a painting that man has C drawn and you're you're struck with this arm I don't know maybe just think about the new phone when you saw the new graphics and try to figure out well this is kind of where we're coming from the latest release of clash Royale right you remember how like oh my goodness look at the graphics now and so there's a certain way that that would have conveyed such this Grandeur but now there's this reformation and I think there's a spiritual application here that I want you to catch there's this rap uh uh Reformation in this Cav AIO who himself was such a contradiction but by joining the sacred things of Christ the scripture and presenting it in a profane way Christ was becoming relatable Christ was becoming knowable in this painting the Madonna of Loretto this was highly criticized when cavio uh drew it why because here's Mary the mother of Jesus and she's Barefoot she's not dressed in these opulent clothes and this was this was Pearl clutching in that day how could you paint the Madonna how could you paint the mother Mary how could you paint the Virgin H in such a common ordinary way and in this scene you see uh uh the these ones bowing are dressed in a way that would be accurate for the 16th 16th century Christ is presented just as a a baby kind of large I don't know how old he was there but uh maybe there was some unnatural proportions here but and there's just slight Halos very slight that if you didn't maybe if you weren't looking closely you wouldn't have even noticed one here and upon Mary so there is something done to convey they're holy there's there's enough there to get the sense that this is symbolic but this is an ordinary scene what he's representing here and portraying here is Christ and and and the mother his mother Mary and it's not in this opulent Grand form it's common it's profane in The Taking of Christ here's Christ being taken in the Betrayal by Judas and here it seems very ordinary you see the the shock and horor on people's faces you see maybe Peter uh grasping him trying to protect him and the soldiers coming to take him away and kavio holding the lantern as he drw drew his own self-portrait in this picture this was considered where's the glory in this where's the awe where's the Wonder this one caused a tremendous stir the death of the Virgin paints a picture that portrays the death of Mary and her she's bloated and and dying and people are Weeping and it shows this sorrow and as you zoom in on the image this is no way to present Mary Mary the Mother of God the holy virgin you don't portray her like this Barefoot dead weeping I'm noticing maybe the color is a little bit better over here um I I threw out the idea of buying the biggest one we could find put in it here for this series so we could at least get some accurate portrayal of all this this art wor sharing but there's a this would be they would say this is not even scripturally accurate this isn't the image we want to portray but it's taking something very real something scriptural and scriptural people and big biblical figures and instead of presenting them as being so far beyond normal that they're unrelatable but just putting it in simple mundane they called it profane in this painting of Matthew and the angel caught of AIO paints Matthew in a way that they thought was very disrespectful Barefoot dressed as a commoner and as he writes this Angel guiding his hand showing him how to write and we'd say well that would be true I mean he didn't write these things on his own but it was stripping Matthew of this awe and this respect and this reverence he was no longer sacred which brings us to our text and if we could use I'm wanting to start here to go further in how God is hidden God hidden in profanity this painting is the calling of St Matthew and in this scene you have the tax collectors and you have Jesus and that's Peter and even in the way that he painted Peter it's almost as if he's just joined joined to Christ you can even notice by the way that kagio has Jesus pointing it reminds you of Michelangelo's uh sis Chapel H uh and uh the creation and the creation of Adam and some say it could be some homage connection there and in this Jesus is in the shadows he's pointing to the table and these young these older Tax Collectors here are so busy counting they don't know him the young ones their face turned looking towards Christ as he points at and there's this figure that may be Matthew he's pointing are you pointing at me am I the one that you're calling in this moment are you reaching out to me and there's a way that you can look at this art and begin to look at it maybe I'm not really I'm a poser right I mean I I I for whatever reasons I enjoy it I just do and I wish I could explain it but there's a way that maybe someone would look at this critically and they notice as I was studying it myself that the window has somewhat of a cross in it but yet there's no light coming through that the light emanates from where Jesus is there's a slight Halo above his head to to let us know that this this is Christ who's now calling Matthew and what struck me and stood out to me is the fact that all each one of these Tax Collectors are dressed in 16th century G uh Ro uh dress it's updated it so if someone was looking at this they would maybe recognize this as being uh Elite clothing or the rich or or somebody in government someone maybe Tax Collector's outfits and they'd be set apart from the regular masses they would be the publicans of the 16th century or the 1500s but yet here's Jesus in a form a a first century Decor we dressed and dressed in first century clothing and he's pointing calling in the modern day in that time to those who looked like everyone else saying Matthew I'm calling you in Luke 5: 27-30 this is just zooming in on the face of Christ now when I when I look at that and I know what cavaj was wanting to portray and that looks so different than what sacred art would want to portray it it it has a realness to it it has a shape and a form that would say he was a man like I was a man he looked like a man he dressed like a man he acted like a man the story says and after these things he went forth and saw a Publican named Levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow me and he left all rose up and followed him and he left all rose up and followed him and Levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was great company of publicans and of others that sat down with him but their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners remember the Pharisees I think the ter phrase we used last year was were skilled in the art of showing off yeah and here Jesus who is kind of an upand Comer and on the scene coming on the scene is one who's different and gaining a following and H he's teaching and he's saying things that are hard to be understood and he has his disciples he has his following and so the critic the skeptic the Pharisees and the scribes they they were of the school of the Sacred art they were of the school of things being separate and elevated and distinct and now Christ who is a teacher and this Rabbi he is now hanging out with the Publican Sinners the publicans and sinners who are profane they're unworthy they're common remember how the Pharisees in Matthew 23:5 but all their Works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their felies and enlarge the borders of their garments it was conspicuous it was uh unnatural proportions they wanted to convey in their act the actual way that they conducted themselves something that was unearthly something that was Grand and something that was sacred they could if they could they would have wore gold Halos if they could they would have signified to everyone else we're special we're holy we're Elite and so when Christ was there with these tax collectors and these Sinners they were saying here is one who claims to be a teacher here's one who claims to know the things of God but yet now he finds himself surrounded by those who are not like us who are different than we are he is joining himself to the profane the common the everyday folk in the Old Testament and under the law God was beyond man he was separate he was unapproachable the Bible even told us can't even look on him in Exodus 3: 1-6 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to horb even this designation of the Mountain of God has made something which was totally natural that anyone would have looked upon and said that's a mountain but now we ascribe to it some sacredness it is the Mountain of God it is it happens because it becomes the Mountain of God because God identifies himself with it and so what we do and this is maybe a religious instinct is that something that would have been just totally natural now gets separated out as something sacred and the angel Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt what's happening something beyond the senses the knowable Moses is drawn to it in the sense of saying okay this is Way Beyond natural and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see to see God when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here I and notice God saying immediately he said draw not nigh hither you've come so far enough put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground okay what made it Holy Ground why was it holy why was it sacred why was it separate was it not profane dirt was it not just common everyday gravel and rock and sand moreover he said I am the god of th father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob in Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God this had now become a sacred space we see this in the life of Jacob when he says this is the very gate to heaven it became a Sacred Space we find these different instances when God appeared the ground where he appeared the place where he appeared it becomes sacred it becomes set apart that's Holy Ground there's nothing about it that made it more holy other than the fact that the Divine manifested himself in that vicinity or there became respected it became revered what we see happening in the scriptures that God manifest himself in a reality that's completely different from the natural order of things he manifests himself and I want to use the word reality that is unreal he manifest himself in a way that is against Natural reality or that is not profane it is not common and we find this in religion and it's man's Instinct both for good and bad that whenever the sacred is seen or manifested in the ordinary religion tends to separate it if there's something that happens uh and it's supernatural there's this uh veneration towards it and so the sacred in our own language becomes that which is the opposite of the profane and we could say that the profane is essentially without God that if this is the Mountain of God it's the Mountain of God and it's sacred because God's there something is sacred because there's something Divine there something Beyond ourselves the temple and the Tabernacle exactly this way and that the the secret place of the Tabernacle was secret it was hidden from view it was sacred the temple and all the instruments therein were sacred they were devoted to God they could not be defiled they had to be washed they had to be handled in a particular way but this God of the Old Testament who would tell Moses you've gone far far enough take off your shoes show reverence respect this ground this dirt this sand this mountain show respect to it what God is showing with each step and each Evolution we were reading in a devotion last night it was so beautiful how the writer took this H uh this this progression through the scripture and how it culminates even to the Book of Revelation H uh through the Old Testament the New Testament showing just how rich God was unfolding himself God was condescending to place where profane reality would actually hide the sacred that it wouldn't be this mountain of God because you couldn't touch it God would speak from it it so transcended who you were that there was this reverence and there was this all because you couldn't deny that something was manifested beyond our reality and therefore it was sacred and it became sacred God wanted to cause his sacredness to be so one with profanity that the profanity would actually hide the deity and in Jesus Christ God was hidden in the profane I know that seems to be a tough language but he was hid in an ordinary common looking man not Head and Shoulders above everybody else not with the permanent Halo behind his head there's a way that I think it's in the uh there's a way that Christ can be portrayed where he's so glorious and and gorgeous and charismatic to it's like I mean I'd follow the guy I mean this is this is a charismatic figure but yet in him that wasn't the drawing card John but yet in John chap 10:33 want you notice how how much the offense of associating the sacred and the Divine with the human how much of an offense that was John 10:33 the Jews answered him saying for good work we Stone thee not he says you Stone me because I do these wonderful Works they're like you know what this is my words maybe we can't explain that but there's one thing that we will Stone you for and that's for blasphemy because that thou being a man maketh thyself god you being a man make being profane make yourself sacred you being nothing but dust and Ashes you being a like everybody else you actually kind of maybe being illegitimate you we know your family we know everyone around you you being profane make yourself Sacred by saying that you're the Son of God and that you're one with the father that there's something separate about you something sacred about you and think of it in terms of a Pharisee who make broad their felies and they broaden the borders of their garments and there wouldd be some virtue signaling where it's like hey look at me I'm separate I'm distinct I'm holy and Jes like look at you you hang out with uh Republicans you hang out with Sinners you hang out with all these folks it's publicans not Republicans people are all right now going with where's the Democrat scripture did I say Democrats Or democrats there there's a way that you look at it and and you say well there's nothing what what about you sacred and you just say that you're the Son of God and you being profane make yourself sacred you're worthy to be stoned but the Bible tells us in Philippians chapter 2: 5 to8 having read this Mo recently we'll just go through it he would made himself of no reputation took on the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself in other words the one who was in the form of God and was equal with God he was in and of himself by virtue of the blood of God be inside of him he was sacred but he took on the form of that which was Unholy he took upon the form of that which was not sacred he was born of a woman and traveled through in the birth process the same way that everyone else was intended to be born or that would be born and in doing so he identified himself so completely with Humanity that he was to the eye fully and 100% profane but yet in Mark 12: 35-37 the Son of God Christ Jesus the Messiah the very one they were all looking to he's he he's the sacred order the scribes and the Pharisees and the Sadducees they knew the word they knew the law and everyone was beholden to them and they would go and they'd sit in their synagogues and they would hear their rabbis and their teachers there was this Rich framework of uh dispensing truths and teaching and asking questions and discourse so everyone could know and it was a repeated process uh uh for one to one with be elevated to master so that they would have the answers to everyone's questions cuz nobody else could really know and understand and there was tribunals and there was decisions and there was criticisms and there was ways of moderating public Behavior but here in Mark CH 12 Jesus Christ who was sacred who was the son of God was found in the form of a man and he doesn't just present an image as a man but now he's relatable as a man and Jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how sa the describes that Christ is the Son of God for David himself said by the Holy Ghost the Lord said to my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thine enemies thy foot stol David therefore himself called him Lord and whence is he then his son asking the real questions now right this is how the scribes and the Pharisees and and the Sadducees and the teachers and the rabbis they wanted things to almost always be a little bit Out Of Reach and then catch this tagline here when he's speaking this doesn't become a riddle that tickles the people's ears it says and the Common People heard him gladly in other words there was no distinction among the elite there was no high social hierarchy where only the scribes and only the Pharisees and only those who knew the word and knew the law could understand him but everyone could understand him the common people suggest a a large multitude of everyone so it's not saying commoners of the poor or and there's this distinction between the peasants and the bougie it was it was nothing in that way it was to say hey this is everyone could hear them and understand them there they were not socially elect there was no Elite Class that they belonged to in order to hear him and I would say this as a caution to those of us who believe so strongly that we are elect that we are called and we have been chosen that we not make the mistake of believing ourselves to be so Elite by election that we lose our connection with our Humanity in a very dark place yes in in a way to where we have ascribed to ourselves absolute immunity and 100% sacredness And in doing so if you truly are indeed elect it's not going to diminish your election but it diminishes Your Capacity to be effective brother brandham said and sir we would see Jesus we know we wouldn't find him as a great educator we don't even have any record of him ever going to school and he wouldn't be a different dressed man because he went in and out among men people didn't know him all of them dressed alike he didn't dress like a priest he didn't dress like a religious man he dressed just like an ordinary man this is not i' say this as a caution maybe this caveat before we go forward it's not that we would strive to fit in and look ordinary especially when the things the sense of that which is ordinary continues to change but it's to recognize that Jesus Christ dressed as an ordinary man lived as an ordinary man presented as an ordinary man and didn't wear garments that in themselves signified some virtue I being better than everyone else or a turned collar into this distinct class but he was declaring God in a way that God could be knowable was God hidden in profanity 1 John 1:2 it says it this way that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the Word of Life in other words we could touch it we could feel it we could understand it we could relate with it it wasn't a mountain that we stood a far off from it wasn't a God in and some uh hovering in the sky that was so bright we had to cover our eyes and that was so so glorious and so powerful that we just had to hide ourselves but yet it was so normal we could see it we can look upon it we can handle it it says of the word of life so the word of life it says in verse two was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us manifested unto us how it wasn't merely the words it wasn't these great Miracles what was it that caused the phes to want to Stone Jesus not for the works he did because they did seem to be sacred but it was when the sacred had becomed enveloped in humanity and it was identified with the man not some one-off not some outlier not some sort of power that was working externally of him from him but rather I am one with Divine I am s SEC because God has chosen me that want that's what made them want to Stone him so the Word of Life which John said he saw wasn't the external things wasn't the we held the bread that he uh broke and multiplied we ate the fish that he multiplied we we saw the water that he walked upon but God had become tangible in a person human religion makes Christ Out Of Reach human religion takes the word of God and always puts it just a little bit beyond grasp it wants to be attractive enough to make you reach for it but once you get closer you realize you can never achieve it and that was the goal of sacred art get the people pining get them reaching get them longing get them so inspired in thought provoked to where they're constantly trying to chase the dragon and and get that high and be a struck and inspired and but always just keep it a little bit Out Of Reach but just like cardio's art in Christ the word was reaching out to the profane it wasn't religion that was causing people to merely reach themselves and the end being like oh sorry you're just a little short you can't reach it but just as in the art there was this response or there's this movement to make the the scriptures relatable to the profane the common to present it ways to where it probably actually was and doing so it was God was in Christ reaching out the sacred was in the profane reaching out to the profane saying you can be one with the sacred it completely changes the Dynamics of how God is wanting to reveal himself in Ephesians chap 2: 13- 14 but now in Christ Jesus ye who saw sometimes we're far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who ha made both one and have broken down the middle wall of partition between us literally this is so real through Christ the division between the sacred and profane is abolished he broke down that middle wall of partition where there was always this all struck wonder of the Sacred place the temple the the instruments the priesthood the Levites all this great beautiful gold and Grandeur which is somehow mirrored then in false religion and Christianity and there's this divide between the religion and Christianity and the secular and that divide is so distinct that we who are just secular human beings can only achieve some sort of nonsecular identity by professing that the sacred and the church and religion is Right In Christ is real but we never have a genuine experience with it it's never reality it's all theater but through Christ that distinction is abolished because according to the word of God the profane can be Sanctified and become a Dwelling Place of the Sacred in 1 Corinthians chapter 1: 26-31 I thank you each of you all of you for holding so closely to what I'm saying in your patience thank you for your continued patience we're getting very close to wrapping up here 1 Corinthians chap 1: 26-31 I maybe I can just poll everyone you just we won't do yays and nays and raise hands but just want to pull you is it making some spiritual sense to you today is there some connection where we use we're using art art which is to me uh all of us can appreciate it or recognize it there's certain principles that seem to be very that are natural we're wanting to use it as a way of getting your attention to draw you into a scriptural truth that is real in this hour very very real the dividing line between the sacred and the profane that there's a theory there's a a discipline a school of thought that says always present God in a way to where he's not knowable and not being able to be known all you are is in awe and then every everything else is worldly profane natural and keep the two separate when God all along was wanting to cause the two to come together to where there's still an awe and reverence but he's now knowable he becomes relatable it becomes reality and you realize the only reality is that which exists in God for you see your calling did I uh okay I I say did I fin I thought maybe I messed up excuse me for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God have chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty very very tremendous truths and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God Chosen and here comes the real kicker yay and things which are not you know what that phrase refers to the profane the things which are not is not a a a reference to things that do not exist so that God refer is using things that don't exist to bring not things that are but the things that are not it was a phrase that was used by the Jews to describe Gentiles they the they were the people which were not which were not a people is that what the prophet had said the things which are not the profane the Gentiles the Godless the Unholy they were but they weren't sacred they existed they had being they had identity they had lives but it was wholly separate from anything Divine they had no caretaker they had no one watching over them but the base things of the world and the things which are despised hath God chosen in other words he's chosen the profane the Unholy the unsacred in your eyes and the things which are not the profane hath he chosen to bring the not bring to not the things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption ye but of him are ye in Christ Jesus Christ Jesus whom God has made unto us he is wisdom righteousness ification and Redemption for us that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord we can Glory but in the Lord we don't glory in the profane but glory is in the profane so we glorify the Lord if I could say it this way I've kind of lost my way in my notes this morning I just need the Lord's help to be able to finish this up but if I could say it this way there must be a 21st century Christ a manifestation of the Sacred in humanity and in doing so it's not a matter of being believable it's not a matter of being convincing but it's a question of whether or not our lives are making Christ knowable sure we could do things that overtly signal that we believe right we could just get big shirts right I'm for Christ and we can use a lot of imagery I was wear a a sweatshirt the other day and and it had God was mentioned on the sweatshirt and someone asked me so what's what's up with that you know what's it for a and I said well it's you know I kind of gave the story of the the brand a little bit but I said it's a reference to scripture about the Breath of God and and inspiration and and has scripture principle and the response was well people just use God anymore for just uh uh for no reason they just use it right God's becoming common I think there's a a popular brand called is it fear God or something like that and it it has nothing to do with God right it's just another iteration of FUBU and it and it's there's nothing you could wear it someone say oh you fear God and and it would be like no I'm wearing fear God and who is the god is it Jesus right there's different there's so many Christ figures and Messiah and ideologies and we don't have to it's not just trying to signal that we're Believers and it's not trying to be convincing or believable but we have Christ has to be knowable and if we subscribe to the the we subscribe to Sacred Arts then we would just try to present ourselves in such a way towards like whoa they're different and we would never be reachable or what we have would never be even desired maybe chased after but never attained even in John chapter 1:10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not why did the world not know him because he looked toally like the world but he wasn't worldly he ate like the world he dressed like the world he walked through the way in the world he he worked in the world he ate the things of the world but yet he was still separate and apart let me say it this way if the world's going to miss you let them be looking over the top of you if the word world's going to miss you be so ordinary be be so uh uh sensible that the world's going to miss you they're going to be looking for a 900 foot Jesus and the 5 foot n Jesus is standing right in front of them be be so relatable and so knowable that the high and mighty a and the lifted up and the educated and the intellectual they're looking over the top of you so that the one who's broken the one that's looking down the one that really needs to find them can see you and look you in the eye and know Christ is relatable in John 7:5 I use this to support I thought that it's not necessar being believable or convincing but being relatable that one of the criticisms of Christ was for neither did his Brethren believe in him didn't change who he was it's not a matter of us living in such a way to where we just we convince everybody man they're just so perfect they handle everything so right but Christ he's knowable in humil humility and service 1 John chap 4: 2 to 4 this is taking some great momentum from last Sunday's service which to me again I just think was so tremendous hereby know ye the spirit of God I didn't preach for those who weren't here every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God to confess it's that the the prefix con which is with and the in logos the word to to be with the word everyone that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world the spirit that denies that the sacred could dwell in the profane the spirit that would say that the Messiah is unable to embody the humanity even the spirit that would confess that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin lived and died and descended again but yet Christ is not in flesh today is the spirit of antichrist because he says ye are of God little children and have overcome him because greater is he the word Christ that is in you than he that is in the world oh it's God is come in the flesh how many of us travel like a thought to work no we don't we may be thinking on our way to work some of us may be able to just roll over and grab our laptop and commence to working but yet we realize we are not making our way through this world in a way that is obviously sacred but yet he is in you I realize it's a tight rope I feel that I tend to draw from these types of subjects let me close with this Christ is identified the same in all generations we've been using a lot of this message now what was Jesus the same yesterday today and forever he's the same yesterday today today and forever in what way how what makes him the same now this is a statement he makes more than once I want you to uh when when I read it I don't want you just to hear it as you've heard it before I don't want you to hear it just to say Amen to it but as the word is going forth I want you to take each piece and get it into your hands and look at it and say what what is he saying what is God wanting me to see I was going to use uh some particular slides and I was trying to I was actually started trying to figure out a way that you could replicate some sense of a mirror in a slideshow all it was doing is just flipping images it was like well this is a should just bring out a mirror what was Jesus now if he stood here wearing this suit that I got on that he gave me now h if he stood here wearing this suit if he sat there wearing what you have on are you thinking about this when he said if he stood here wearing the suit that I have on in some ways it's true he was standing there he was wearing the suit that brother Brenham had on the question is as he was in this prayer line and he was looking at it from another angle he said if the woman is sick could he heal her if Christ is living today wearing the clothes that you have on could he heal someone who is sick he says be careful now be careful no he could not do it and if we stopped the tape right then and there we would because we were so frustrated we'd miss the point he has already done it so if God is here today Liv living in flesh it's not that he has to go back and do things that are already done he if he's here now in the suit brother B says if he's on this platform Christ in flesh wearing a suit not a robe not Thorn prints not a crow but he's wearing something that we would expect someone in that situation to be wearing he couldn't heal because he's already done it he quotes the scripture he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we are healed he has already done it right the only thing he could do would just identify himself to her is that right and make it known that he's raised from the dead and alive and now that he would identify himself we could take these different scenarios and expand them a little bit further brother brandham said If God Was Here Christ was here in my flesh wear in this suit that I have on he couldn't heal you but he could perform a sign and do something that is obviously Divine and sacred and identify himself with the flesh so that he could awake something in you to believe the word which has been written and to believe for something that has already happened and so I say the same thing to you today echoing what brother brandham said that if Christ was here right now in the clothes that you have on if you are the word made flesh today we don't need to stand on a platform and perform discernment because it's already been done we don't need to go back and die on a cross it is not a matter of Christ healing today but it's identifying himself through you to where he can be believed believe for what he promised God hidden in profanity the word becoming a reality in ordinary everyday life I know I'm repeating myself over and over and over again I've done it for four years and I could just blame the church is growing so we got to start over you know every time we but let me say this I haven't called the musicians because I want everyone to to focus on these these last few things I just I wrote this down specifically last night as one of the last things I just wanted to summarize this with this is our challenge now this is my challenge to you is to be Godly enough to be separate but human enough to be relatable sacred enough to be separate Sanctified enough holy enough to be separate to not be worldly but existing enough in the world that you can make God known yeah it may seem to be kind of heavy clunky words and we could find a different way of say saying it flesh becoming word in different ways that we could say it but it's the sacred in profanity you're expressing sacredness but you're doing it through you through a life and as I've shared this with a number of I say a number a handful of people and I've tried to express my heart is different the feedback comes in the fellowship I love to fellowship on these things I don't love to fellowship on it so I could be told that was an excellent sermon I like to be fellowshipping on the content and I enjoy that I learn from it I grow from it I I get feedback often times where I realize well I didn't see that angle that's probably what the real angle was or I get feedback sometimes this was I didn't quite understand this part I enjoyed the fellowship on it and so I'll try to express to you as I close in this idea of God hidden in profanity throughout history there have been attempts to express Divine things in the scripture in the Bible and there was a there was a thought that you had to express the Divine in ways and I'm I I know I'm repeating myself but in a way that was always just Out Of Reach because it was Supernatural it was sacred it was holy it was beyond us Beyond normal com the commoner and then in the Reformation where the word which at one time was in a language that could only be read by the priesthood and there was this separation from the church from the believer and those in authority and those in control the Reformation was getting the word back into the hands of the people so that they could read it and the common people could be glad and rejoice in the word of God there was a moving away from always trying to present the present the Divine in an unreachable form but began to present it in a way to where you could know him know the story and relate to it because you were human didn't separate the scriptural aspect out of it it didn't separate the Divinity from it but it was showing that Christ was divine and yet human at the same time and the different stories of the martyrs and things it was painted through these pictures to say wow these were humans they were overcoming human things and it was to make in that sense too there was a way that things in that day could the I could see the gospel being portrayed through that art and if we are to be the word made flesh today we can't go back to first century costumes we can't go back to 16th century costumes we can't go to church H uh uh we can't go to church forms and H uh uh priest robes and collars and we try to figure out a way to where we can signal that we're Christians but God has to find a way to express himself in the 21st century if we all wore leather sandals and robes grew beards and dressed ourselves in a certain way and we walked everywhere we went and we tried to be a caricature of an image that we've seen from Days Gone By no question we get attention and a lot of people might think you look like a literal Jesus and there might be a way that you could dress and act to portray some very serious zealousness of a Christian but my point is this and it's a very difficult one to make but God is wanting to paint a picture today of the Bride that upon first glance you would say they're just humans right that's just a normal scene right that's just that's just a woman holding her baby that's just a that's just a man who died that's just this that's just that but upon closer inspection you realize there's more going on in this person's life that there's more to their character there's more to their testimony and there's got to be a way I'll I'll I'll pick up on this maybe Lord willing Wednesday night there's a way that God's going to express himself individually through each one of you the church wants to force this image where it's all homogeneous and everyone looks the same talks the same and does everything the same way but but God is a god of variety and he doesn't want us to look like lutherans he doesn't want us to look like methodists he doesn't want us to look like uh people from Indiana God wants you to look like a human being who has been blessed with the glory of God who is Sanctified who is serious about the things of God and we walk that line to where we can be Godly enough to be separate from the world but human enough for that that godliness to be known and I would say this many of us have made the mistake of Leaning too far into the worldliness and there's not enough separateness because we rest on the the the elitism or the social distinction we're bride that there's this hidden hidden election deep down in my flesh where I can do whatever I want in my private time in my social time in my Endeavors in the way that I handle my finances the way that I treat my family in the way that I dress the way that I act and the things I ingest you name it across the board there's some sense that because I believe believe I can remain profane but that's not the challenge the challenge is not believing as much as it is being holy unto the Lord in Christ to the profane who's reaching out and not pushing away even with our own children to have lives that are engaging as parents we can't live so high and holy to our kids are like they're just aliens they're not even normal it wouldn't surprise me one day if they just ripped off the mask one day and there was a mini UFO operating them but then and then again we don't want to be so worldly you know that's one of our challenges right now in our home it's telling telling my kids that we have a home phone which actually happens to be a cell phone it's like stay off your phone please get off your phone dude right and so my only argument in Needmore is I don't want you to be like me hey I don't want you to grow up to be like me don't take my phone away hey there's going to be a day when you can't take the phone away and you don't want to be perceived as somebody who's never owned a phone does can't relate doesn't know what's going on so strict so austere so unworldly that you're not even human anymore and the sacred is never known it's just thought about it's just reverenced God help us to be him hidden in profanity could we stand together musicians you could come we'll bow our heads in a word of prayer I was looking for brother Michael I might want to turn turn it over to him let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer [Music] our gracious Heavenly [Music] Father you've been so good to us you're kind you're faithful and we can in our own lives testify that we have witnessed the sacred we've seen seen you manifested in situations and circumstances we've seen you manifested in settings and we cannot deny that there's a real God there's something Supernatural but Lord the greatest of all experiences is when we're born again by the Holy Ghost and that which was always separate and that which was was always just a little bit Out Of Reach and undeniable then becomes a personal experience where we can know you and I believe father that your goal is that from that Divine spark that's ignited at the time that we're born again it's your desire that you would have preeminence in our lives so that we could become the ultimate expression of the Divine walking on water Halo effects and pillars of fire and tremendous signs and wonders and miracles all declare a sacred God who is unlike us but the greatest manifestation of the word of God today is the message that says we can be like you that we ourselves could be a bearer of your light that through the work of the calvary the shedding of blood the abolishment of the division between the sacred and the profane the profane have access now to the Divine not to visit not to enjoy in a church service but to commune with and fellowship with and Lord there's a way that the world looks and we don't need to look like that but what do you look like today why has the word been so precise why was it preserved in this hour and taught and restored back and even demonstrated and lived why why did you do it the way that you did it today I believe lord it's because you want a 21st century Christ just as Jesus walked as a Nazarene and he walked as a Jew he walked as a son of Mary and Joseph and there was so much about him that was [Music] common there needs to be a lot of stuff about us that's common and Lord wherever it is we need our help whether it is to be more Divine and more like you or to be less arrogant and prideful and more human just keep working work on us
