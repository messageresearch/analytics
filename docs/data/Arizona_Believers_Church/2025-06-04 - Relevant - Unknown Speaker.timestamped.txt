[0:00] Exodus 3:es 10-17.
[0:03] Come now therefore, and I will send thee
[0:05] unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring
[0:08] forth my people, the children of Israel,
[0:10] out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God,
[0:13] Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh,
[0:15] and that I should bring the children of
[0:17] Israel, out of Egypt? And he said,
[0:19] Certainly, I will be with thee, and this
[0:20] shall be a token unto thee that I have
[0:22] sent thee, when thou hast brought forth
[0:24] the people out of Egypt. Ye shall serve
[0:26] God upon this mountain. And Moses said
[0:28] unto God, Behold, when I come unto the
[0:30] children of Israel, and shall say unto
[0:32] them, the God of your fathers hath sent
[0:33] me unto you, and they shall say to me,
[0:36] what is his name? What shall I say unto
[0:38] them? And God said unto Moses, I am that
[0:41] I am. And he said, Thou shalt thus shalt
[0:44] thou say unto the children of Israel, I
[0:46] am have sent me unto you. And God said,
[0:50] moreover unto Moses, thus shalt thou say
[0:52] unto the children of Israel, the Lord
[0:54] God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
[0:56] the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
[0:58] hath sent me unto you, this is my name
[1:01] forever, and this is my memorial unto
[1:02] all generations. Go and gather the
[1:05] elders of Israel together, and say unto
[1:06] them, the Lord God of your fathers, the
[1:08] God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
[1:10] appeared unto me, saying, I have surely
[1:12] visited you, and seen that which is done
[1:14] to you in Egypt. Amen. and you can take
[1:17] your seats.
[1:21] Title tonight is relevant and kind of
[1:23] been forecasting that over the last few
[1:25] services. Uh relevant is the title and
[1:29] we've been looking at how uh real
[1:32] relatable and relevant and how that a
[1:34] witness and the witness the testimony of
[1:37] that witness must be real. Uh it's a
[1:40] reality to that one and in being a
[1:42] reality to that one has been made uh a
[1:45] reality too. Therefore, it could be made
[1:47] a reality by us. If it's something we
[1:49] know, then it's something that we can
[1:51] convey. It's something that we could
[1:52] express. As we were dealing with
[1:54] something being relatable, we were
[1:56] talking about something that was capable
[1:57] of being relayed or declared or
[1:59] expressed, uh something that you could
[2:01] sympathize with or identify with. And
[2:04] relatability, what we focused on is how
[2:06] it's even the art of connecting with
[2:08] others on a personal level where you
[2:10] relate to them and then they can relate
[2:12] to you. And one of our desires should be
[2:15] as a Christian is that we would be able
[2:17] to be relatable or understood by other
[2:19] people. And we could also relate to
[2:22] other people ourselves. Not just that we
[2:24] can be accepted and belong to a lot of
[2:26] nice clubs and be invited to a lot of
[2:28] cool parties, but that the gospel can be
[2:31] related to by others. That the Christ
[2:33] that we've come to know in a real way
[2:35] could be expressed and revealed to
[2:37] others in a very real way. So, we've
[2:39] been looking at real relatable. We've
[2:41] just been spending one service on each
[2:42] one of those and tonight relevant and
[2:46] just a lot of things that we could pack
[2:48] into this particular portion. I want to
[2:51] go about it in a very easy way just by
[2:53] reading a lot of scriptures just to kind
[2:54] of gather some details. But just bear
[2:57] with me as I want to define uh relevant.
[3:00] And then one other word that to me is
[3:02] connected with it. To be relevant, it's
[3:04] directly connected with or important to
[3:06] the matter at hand. And we all can begin
[3:08] to think about this. Sometimes something
[3:10] is brought up and we're like that's not
[3:12] even relevant. Has nothing to do with
[3:14] the issue or that which is being spoken
[3:16] of or that which is at hand. So it's
[3:17] directly connected with or important to
[3:20] the matter at hand or it has another way
[3:23] of saying it's significant bearing upon
[3:25] something that's being discussed or
[3:27] something that's happening. So if
[3:28] something is relevant then it's going to
[3:32] add value or give some clarity to an
[3:34] issue. It's going to add to a
[3:36] discussion. It's going to be something
[3:37] that kind of gives value to some
[3:39] analysis. And so, as I was looking at
[3:41] this, it has to do with something that's
[3:42] significant or applicable. So, if
[3:45] something's relevant, it's significant.
[3:47] It has uh an impact. It adds value. Or
[3:50] we could say that it is uh in that way
[3:53] it is applicable. So, something useful
[3:56] in a particular situation, something
[3:59] important. Actually, if you could just
[4:01] maybe let this lodge in your mind. I
[4:03] didn't know how much I wanted to go
[4:04] through this particular part but to the
[4:07] word relevant actually comes from the
[4:09] Latin origin the root word is to lift up
[4:11] to lighten or to relieve that
[4:14] interesting we say something is uh
[4:16] relevant then it has something to do
[4:18] with to lift up or to lighten to
[4:20] unbburden or to relieve and I say that's
[4:23] probably the real thrust or the emphasis
[4:25] of our witness is that we would want to
[4:27] give people hope for relief from their
[4:29] sins that they would know that they
[4:31] could become unburdened of their sins
[4:33] and then also all the other burdens that
[4:35] we get loaded on us. And so there's a
[4:37] lot in the Bible about empathizing with
[4:39] someone else's suffering, relieving
[4:40] someone of their burden uh and serving.
[4:43] So this to be relevant, it actually
[4:45] speaks to being adding value, being
[4:48] something that's applicable or
[4:49] significant. It's to lighten or to
[4:52] relieve. Now, the other word that I was
[4:54] thinking of, and it could uh could have
[4:56] probably had four Rs instead of just
[4:58] three. I don't even know how to trail
[5:00] two Rs, let alone four. uh but real
[5:03] relevant uh relatable relevant it could
[5:05] have also been uh relative and this one
[5:07] is unique but I think it has something
[5:09] to do with relevance because if
[5:11] something isn't relative it may lack
[5:13] relevance but to be relative it's
[5:15] understood or evaluated in relation to
[5:18] something else or another thing I say
[5:19] well it's uh someone says it's is it hot
[5:22] and you say well it's a dry heat and so
[5:23] it's all relative or it's this it's that
[5:25] and so it's the quality value or
[5:27] measurement on that depends upon a
[5:29] particular condition or frame of
[5:31] reference that it doesn't really have uh
[5:34] you have to look at it within the
[5:36] context of something else. It's relative
[5:38] to something else. So it implies
[5:40] relationship. It implies in some ways a
[5:42] dependence upon some other factor. Uh
[5:44] context is a word that kept coming to me
[5:46] over and over again. So there's some
[5:48] connection or comparison or relationship
[5:52] when something is relative or using this
[5:54] term relative. It actually comes from uh
[5:56] the Latin word of the origin having
[5:58] reference or relation. It's why we call
[6:01] our cousins or our brothers if we dare
[6:03] to a relative is because it's someone
[6:05] that's in relation to you. It has some
[6:08] reference point to you. So both of these
[6:10] words, each one is looking at context
[6:12] and relationship. If it's relevant, it
[6:14] adds something to the issue, the the the
[6:17] moment uh the the the matter that's
[6:20] being discussed. And then also if it's
[6:22] relative itself, it's got to be
[6:25] relative. How does it exist within the
[6:27] context? is have some sort of
[6:28] relationship to these other things. Now,
[6:30] what I'm talking about is being a
[6:33] witness and the impact that our lives
[6:34] have on others and how that we are to be
[6:36] a voice. We're to be uh billboards for
[6:39] God. Now, if you look at Exodus chapter
[6:42] 3, I want to examine how God uses
[6:44] witnesses here in particular a prophet
[6:46] Moses at a time of deliverance and how
[6:49] that he's going to use a particular
[6:50] vessel. says in verse 10 that he's going
[6:53] to send him I'm going to send you unto
[6:55] Pharaoh that you're to bring him out.
[6:57] And so we're going to read several
[6:58] scriptures. Some of them are lengthy,
[7:00] but I just want us to catch some uh
[7:02] small but I would say important details
[7:04] on what that we can glean from to know
[7:07] our role as a witness and now that we
[7:10] want to be uh we want to be able to not
[7:13] just be relatable but relevant with our
[7:16] testimony. So let's just start with
[7:18] verse 13. in Exodus 3:es 13-16.
[7:21] And Moses said unto God, behold, when I
[7:24] come unto the children of Israel, and
[7:26] shall say unto them, the God of your
[7:28] fathers hath sent me unto you, they
[7:29] shall say to me, what is his name? They
[7:31] want to identify with him. They want to
[7:34] begin to understand who is he? What's
[7:35] his name? Let we want to know more about
[7:37] him. What shall I say unto them? And God
[7:40] said unto Moses, I am that I am. And he
[7:43] said, thus shalt thou say unto the
[7:44] children of Israel, I am hath sent me
[7:46] unto you. And God said, moreover unto
[7:49] Moses, of this, notice his language he
[7:51] that he repeats. Thus shalt thou say
[7:53] unto the children of Israel, the Lord
[7:56] God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
[7:58] the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
[8:00] hath sent me unto you. So now Moses is
[8:02] going to say, this is the one, the God
[8:04] of your fathers has sent me to you. This
[8:07] is my name forever, and this is my
[8:08] memorial unto you, unto all generations.
[8:11] Go and gather the elders of Israel
[8:13] together and say unto them, the Lord God
[8:15] of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
[8:17] Isaac, and of Jacob appeared unto me,
[8:19] saying, I have surely visited you and
[8:21] saying that which is done to you in
[8:23] Egypt. It's very just very simple.
[8:26] What's uh what's being expressed here in
[8:28] this language is God is connecting
[8:30] himself to their forefathers. He is the
[8:33] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the
[8:34] God of Jacob. So there's some
[8:36] relationship that he has to their
[8:37] forefathers. And in doing so, he's
[8:41] giving them not just there's some
[8:43] relationship here and he's also giving
[8:44] them context that this is a promise that
[8:46] was made to your fathers. And God sends
[8:49] Moses. Now, this is so very very simple
[8:52] that I'm I'm afraid that maybe some of
[8:54] you might be disappointed, but it's very
[8:57] simple that God uses Moses because he
[9:00] has a relationship to Israel.
[9:02] Uh God didn't just send in an outsider
[9:04] and a magi shows up on a camel and he
[9:07] starts giving out gifts and he says,
[9:08] "Now follow me back to the promised
[9:09] land." But God sends Moses because he
[9:12] has a relationship to Israel as an
[9:13] Israelite. And he also has a
[9:15] relationship to Pharaoh. He has some
[9:17] familiarity with Egypt. There's some
[9:19] connection there. And so God is using
[9:22] somebody. He's using a relatable person
[9:25] uh to come and speak to Israel. He's
[9:27] using somebody that could relate even to
[9:29] the affairs of Egypt that could come and
[9:31] speak to Pharaoh. And God is doing it.
[9:33] This to me is a key. God's using someone
[9:35] that the people could relate to to bring
[9:37] the people into fellowship with himself,
[9:40] not remain in between. And and that may
[9:43] be one of the dangers sometimes if we
[9:44] can't get ourselves out of a way as a
[9:46] witness or we can't get the messenger
[9:47] out of the way of Christ and we get
[9:49] drawn more to the man of things instead
[9:51] of getting to Christ himself. So God
[9:54] doesn't send a prophet, a witness or a
[9:55] messenger so that that one would always
[9:57] remain in between us, but so that
[9:59] someone who could help us to know the
[10:02] one that sent them uh could bring us
[10:04] into relationship with God. Now in
[10:07] Deuteronomy 18:15, so very simple there,
[10:10] we're going to move on from it. What's
[10:11] being expressed here is that Moses was
[10:13] an Israelite. God's going to use one of
[10:16] an Israelite who uh to come and say, "I
[10:20] have been sent by not just a deity, but
[10:22] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[10:24] and the God of Jacob." Its context, its
[10:26] relationship gives them some more
[10:28] something broader to see than just some
[10:30] man claiming to be a Messiah or a
[10:32] messenger. In Deuteronomy 18:15,
[10:37] and this is very important scriptures.
[10:40] It's prophecy of Jesus Christ. that says
[10:42] the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee
[10:44] a prophet from the midst of thee. So
[10:48] he's going to come from you from your
[10:50] people of thy brethren. That means he's
[10:52] going to be the word means a relative
[10:54] somebody that could relate to them.
[10:55] Somebody who has some connection to them
[10:57] and he says like unto me as Moses was
[11:00] from Israel. He was a child of a Hebrew
[11:03] and he identified with the nation of the
[11:05] Israelites a prophet raised up to bring
[11:07] them out. He says, "God is going to send
[11:09] you another deliverer, another Messiah,
[11:11] and he's going to be of your brethren.
[11:13] He's going to be a Jew. He's going to be
[11:15] a gentile, a an Israelite, and he says,
[11:18] "Unto him you shall hearken." So there's
[11:20] this connection now, not just a Messiah
[11:23] coming, but he's going to be like you.
[11:25] He's going to come from among you. John
[11:28] 1 11 says, "He came unto his own, and
[11:31] his own received him not." Who are the
[11:33] own? The own was his own country, his
[11:36] own city, his own family, his own
[11:38] temple, to the land that uh he that was
[11:40] his own land, to this peculiar people
[11:42] that the the land belonged to. He came
[11:44] to his own nation. He came to his own
[11:46] his own citizens, his own brethren. So
[11:49] that's who he was sent to. Why? He's
[11:50] from that town. He's from that city.
[11:53] He's from He's from this land. He's from
[11:55] that nation. He has that uh connection
[11:58] through Joseph and Mary to the very
[11:59] throne royally, legally, and royally. He
[12:02] has that right uh in his genealogy
[12:04] though we know he came from God. God
[12:06] does this so that there can be some
[12:08] relatability to Christ.
[12:13] So he came to his own and his own
[12:14] received him not. He came to his own
[12:16] family his own brothers. He was he was
[12:18] am of them. Somebody that they could
[12:21] look at and say well it's not just it's
[12:22] this isn't some wild foreigner coming in
[12:25] here telling us what to do. This is this
[12:26] is someone who's raised. We know who
[12:28] Joseph is. We know where he comes from.
[12:29] He's circumcised on the eighth day. This
[12:31] is one of us. And it says in Luke 2:32,
[12:36] speaking of Christ, he says, "A light to
[12:38] lighten the Gentiles." We know that he
[12:40] was sent as a light to Israel. But the
[12:42] Bible says he's a light to lighten the
[12:44] Gentiles and the glory of thy people
[12:46] Israel. So he's the glory of the people
[12:47] of Israel, but he's also to be a light
[12:50] to lighten. Now to lighten is to give
[12:51] revelation, but it also to me had some
[12:54] connection with the Latin word to
[12:55] lighten. It's going to be relevant to
[12:58] the Gentiles, can have an impact on
[13:00] these Gentiles. Now, this is where just
[13:03] taking these very simple principles of
[13:07] uh God showing some connection to the
[13:10] people he's coming to some relationship,
[13:13] giving them some some context so they
[13:15] can know what what's happening. Just
[13:17] watch how he does this, how this light
[13:20] to the Gentiles is going to come. and
[13:22] think of the book of Acts. And we're
[13:23] going to read a number of scriptures on
[13:25] how this gospel begins to unfold. You
[13:27] might be trying to anticipate where I'm
[13:29] going. Maybe only brother John knows
[13:31] just exactly where I'm going. I didn't
[13:33] print notes out for Jack, so he doesn't
[13:35] even know. Uh but there's it's just very
[13:37] simple and I just want to look at how
[13:39] God you see how God used Moses. We could
[13:42] think about Christ, but I want to really
[13:43] focus on Paul and some of these aspects
[13:45] in the New Testament. So Acts 13 46 to
[13:48] 49. It says, "Then Paul and Barnabas
[13:50] waxed bold and said it was necessary
[13:52] that the word of God should first have
[13:54] been spoken to you." Now, this is to
[13:57] Israel, to the Jews, the one that Christ
[13:59] came to. Uh, but seeing you put it from
[14:02] you and judge yourselves unworthy of
[14:04] everlasting life, we turn to the
[14:06] Gentiles. So, the word came to the
[14:10] Messiah came to Israel. He came to the
[14:12] Jews. He came to those of his own land
[14:14] and of his own inheritance and should
[14:17] have been understood. He knew their
[14:18] customs. He knew their laws. He even
[14:19] practiced their customs. He went to the
[14:21] synagogue. He he followed uh many of
[14:23] their He followed their laws. He was
[14:25] blameless before them in many ways. And
[14:27] yet they turn him down. You've deemed
[14:30] yourself I love how he says unworthy of
[14:32] everlasting life. Lo, we turned to the
[14:34] Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded
[14:38] us, saying, I have set thee to be a
[14:41] light of the Gentiles. Notice how Christ
[14:44] was be to be a light to lighten the
[14:46] Gentiles. and how that to the Jews who
[14:48] sat in darkness, great light had sprung
[14:50] up. And now as the gospel is turning to
[14:52] the Gentiles and that Jewish church ages
[14:55] are completely ending, he says,"Ive set
[14:57] thee to be a light of the Gentiles that
[14:59] thou should us be for salvation unto the
[15:01] ends of the earth. And when the Gentiles
[15:04] heard this, they were glad and glorified
[15:05] the word of the Lord, and as many as
[15:07] were ordained to eternal life believed."
[15:09] Important scripture there. And the word
[15:11] of the Lord was published throughout all
[15:13] the region. published not printed but it
[15:16] was broadcast it was displayed it was
[15:18] lived it was it was uh declared by lives
[15:21] it was witnessed of among all the region
[15:24] so when the gospel is turning to the
[15:26] Gentiles Paul says the Lord has
[15:29] commanded us to we are to be a witness
[15:30] we are to be a light to the Gentiles and
[15:33] as they're witnessing this great
[15:34] salvation those who are ordained to
[15:36] eternal life believe in this gospel this
[15:38] is this is the effect and the impact of
[15:40] the gospel being preached this is part
[15:42] of the book of acts and it's only those
[15:44] who are ordained to eternal life that
[15:46] actually believe. And then it says the
[15:48] word of the Lord through those who
[15:50] received the word and became the word.
[15:52] The word of the Lord was published
[15:54] throughout all the region. Now in Acts
[15:57] chapter 9:15, so you can see how this is
[15:59] working where Paul is bold. He speaks.
[16:02] We turn to the Gentiles. We are sent to
[16:03] be witnesses to the Gentiles. And when
[16:06] the Lord is speaking to Ananas in Acts
[16:08] chapter 9:15 says, "But the Lord said
[16:10] unto him, go thy way, for he is a chosen
[16:12] vessel unto me to bear my name before
[16:15] the Gentiles and kings and the children
[16:18] of Israel." Just as Moses had been sent
[16:22] to stand before Pharaoh and say, "Let
[16:24] God's people go." Just as he was called
[16:26] to stand before the children of Israel
[16:27] and say, "The God of your father
[16:29] Abraham, the God of your father Isaac,
[16:31] the God of your father Jacob has sent
[16:32] me, one of your own brethren, to lead
[16:34] you to that place that he promised you
[16:36] in Abraham's seed after him." Now, he's
[16:39] saying that God is calling Paul to be a
[16:42] light to the Gentiles, to bear the name
[16:45] of Jesus Christ before the Gentiles.
[16:47] He's called to be a witness. It's called
[16:49] to testify, to preach the gospel, to
[16:51] bring this great light to those who did
[16:54] not know of this light at all, who had
[16:55] no promise of a Messiah. Now, there's
[16:58] some other places we could refer to in
[17:00] here where Paul makes reference to this,
[17:03] and we're just looking at these little
[17:04] snippets in Paul's life. In Acts chapter
[17:07] 22, 25-28,
[17:11] there's uh he's being arrested. He's
[17:15] being bound. He's being beaten because
[17:17] of his witness and his testimony of the
[17:18] gospel. And it says, "And as they bound
[17:20] him with thongs, Paul said unto the
[17:22] centurion that stood by, is it lawful
[17:24] for you to scourge a man that is a Roman
[17:26] and unconddemned?"
[17:28] This is a complete needle off the record
[17:31] type thing. Everything's going to stop
[17:33] down. And when the centurion heard that,
[17:35] he went and told the chief captain,
[17:36] saying, "Take heed what thou doest, for
[17:38] this man is a Roman." Now, this is very
[17:41] interesting, isn't it? who Paul said he
[17:44] was a Pharisee of the Pharisees. He was
[17:46] a Jew of the Jew and touching the law
[17:48] blameless. And we say, "This man is an
[17:50] Israelite with papers from Jerusalem to
[17:52] persecute the Christians." And you
[17:53] think, "This man is all Israel." But
[17:56] yet, as he's being beaten, and he makes
[17:58] reference to his citizenship earlier in
[17:59] this this book, but he says, "Could you
[18:02] do this to a Roman?" They recognize that
[18:04] Paul is a Roman citizen. This man is a
[18:07] Roman. Then the chief captain came and
[18:09] said unto him, tell me, "Art thou a
[18:11] Roman?" And he said, "Yay." And the
[18:13] chief cap captain answered, "With a
[18:15] great sum obtained I this freedom." In
[18:17] other words, the captain had bought his
[18:19] Roman citizenship, which was you're able
[18:21] to do, and it cost a great sum. And
[18:24] those who bought their citizenship were
[18:25] still citizens, but they were kind of
[18:27] recognized as secondass citizens to
[18:29] those whom Paul identifies himself with.
[18:31] And says, Paul said, "But I was
[18:32] freeborn. I was born a Roman citizen. I
[18:36] was born free. I'm not a slave. I'm not
[18:38] a servant. I'm unconddemned. I am a free
[18:40] Roman citizen. Now, there's a lot we
[18:43] could give historically, but I just want
[18:44] you to maybe use your own uh imagination
[18:48] and your own knowledge to realize this
[18:49] is important. The fact that he is a
[18:52] Roman citizen immediately stops what
[18:54] they they immediately they realize that
[18:56] they are violating the rights of this
[18:58] citizen that they're doing something
[19:00] that they ought not to do to one who has
[19:03] certain rights and certain privileges.
[19:04] But just look at this and it's very
[19:06] simple picture we're trying to paint
[19:07] tonight. Paul was not just a Jew, he's a
[19:09] Roman, right? So when when Paul is
[19:12] standing before the Jews and teaching,
[19:13] this would be this is wasn't this Saul
[19:15] of Tarsus. And so you can see there
[19:17] where his connection would be being born
[19:19] in Roman territory. They say, "Isn't
[19:21] this Saul? This this is the Jew. This is
[19:22] the one that learned in Galia. This is
[19:24] the one that did this. This is the one
[19:25] who was of the Pharisees." And there's a
[19:27] lot that you could say about Paul to say
[19:29] he was a believer. He was an Israelite.
[19:32] He he would understand the Jewish laws
[19:34] and and the and the writings that they
[19:36] believed in. But he's not just a Jew,
[19:38] he's also a Roman. So it positions him
[19:41] in a very unique place to where now when
[19:42] he turns to the Romans, he's not just
[19:44] showing up like a Jew who thinks he's
[19:46] better than everybody else, telling
[19:48] others what to do. Why are you so quiet
[19:51] tonight?
[19:53] Reminds me of one of our favorite uh
[19:56] sermons, so to speak, is when John Piper
[19:59] was speaking at a convention for
[20:00] American uh Christian psychologist.
[20:03] And on the docket that day was uh a
[20:06] comedian to speak and they mixed up the
[20:10] printed schedule and brother John Piper
[20:12] shows up to speak in the slot that all
[20:14] these Christian psychologists thought
[20:16] was going to be a comedian. So he's
[20:18] trying to talk real honestly and sincere
[20:20] and everyone's laughing at him and the
[20:21] more he's like I've never been laughed
[20:23] at before. This is weird. The more they
[20:24] just start crying laughing and hooting
[20:26] and hauling because they thought he was
[20:27] a comedian. Like this guy's dead pan is
[20:29] perfect. Well, I mean, if you're just
[20:31] going to be dead silent, you could at
[20:32] least laugh at me. Right. There you go.
[20:34] Now, we're all waking up. All right. So,
[20:36] if we're all together on this, it's
[20:38] 7:47. Let's take off. Acts 15:es 1:5.
[20:42] Recognize what's happened here because
[20:44] we're just walking through the story
[20:45] looking at these little snippets. And it
[20:47] says, "Certain men which came down from
[20:48] Judea taught the brethren
[20:51] and said, except you be circumcised
[20:53] after the manner of Moses, you cannot be
[20:55] saved." Now, is that the gospel?
[20:58] No. This isn't the gospel. When
[21:00] therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small
[21:02] dissension and disputation with him,
[21:04] they determined that Paul and Barnabas
[21:05] and certain other of them should go up
[21:07] to Jerusalem under the apostles and
[21:09] elders about this question. So now it
[21:10] becomes this issue of whether or not
[21:13] everyone should be circumcised after the
[21:16] manner of Moses. Now in reality, this
[21:17] would only be relevant to what? A
[21:19] non-Jew. They would have already been
[21:20] circumcised on the eighth day uh the
[21:22] eighth day. the eighth day. And that
[21:24] would have been something that would
[21:26] have been uh according to their own law
[21:28] and their own traditions. But now it's
[21:30] trying to be imposed on those who were
[21:32] Gentiles who had not been circumcised.
[21:35] And it says in verse three, "And being
[21:37] brought on their way by church by the
[21:39] church, they passed through Venus and
[21:41] Samaria declaring the conversion of the
[21:43] Gentiles and they cause great joy unto
[21:46] all the brethren." The gospel is turned
[21:47] to the Gentiles. People are being saved
[21:50] as we read in uh in Acts chapter 13. We
[21:52] now turn to the Gentiles. Now the
[21:54] Gentiles are receiving the word. Verse
[21:56] four. And when they were come to
[21:57] Jerusalem, coming to the the the uh that
[22:01] center point,
[22:03] ground zero of this breaking forth of
[22:05] this church. They were received of the
[22:07] church and of the apostles and elders,
[22:09] and they declared all things that God
[22:10] had done with them. But there rose up
[22:12] certain of the sect of the Pharisees,
[22:14] which believed, saying there that it was
[22:17] needful to circumcise them, and to
[22:19] command them to keep the law of Moses.
[22:21] So they are telling them that this is
[22:24] what has happened as the gospel has gone
[22:26] to the Gentiles and the Gentiles are
[22:27] receiving the gospel and they're being
[22:29] converted to Christ and they're they're
[22:31] receiving the Holy Ghost and they're
[22:33] coming into this great family. He says
[22:35] there are some who are of the sect of
[22:37] the Pharisees who having been
[22:40] Israelites, having been Jews, are now
[22:42] imposing upon the Gentiles the need to
[22:45] be circumcised in order to keep the law
[22:48] of Moses. And this is a great debate
[22:50] that's going to rage in the church there
[22:52] in Jerusalem. And they come to their
[22:53] conclusion in verse 22. Then pleased the
[22:57] apostle and elders when the whole church
[22:59] to send chosen men of their own company
[23:02] to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas,
[23:04] namely Judas, surname, Barsabus, and
[23:06] Silas, chief men among the brethren.
[23:08] These would be Jews who are going to
[23:10] speak according to the law and even
[23:12] their own conviction about whether or
[23:14] not that law would be applicable to the
[23:16] Christians. He says, "And they wrote
[23:17] letters by them after this manner. The
[23:20] apostles and elders and brethren send
[23:21] greeting unto the brethren which are of
[23:23] the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and
[23:25] Cissia. For as much as we have heard
[23:28] that certain which went out from us have
[23:30] troubled you with words, subverting your
[23:32] souls, saying, you must be circumcised
[23:34] and keep the law to whom he gave no such
[23:37] commandment."
[23:39] There's a there's this connection that
[23:41] the maybe these Pharisees could have to
[23:43] the Messiah to say, "Hey, look, wouldn't
[23:46] I know better? Wouldn't I be able to
[23:49] know the law a little bit better and
[23:50] know who the Messiah is and what he's
[23:52] supposed to do?" And so, there could be
[23:54] some undue influence that they could
[23:56] have. So, now the Jews in Jerusalem are
[23:59] are answering to the Gentiles. They're
[24:01] entering into their suffering. They're
[24:02] being empathetic and they want them to
[24:04] know that as far as we who are of the
[24:06] church at Jerusalem and Jews ourselves
[24:08] who've been converted, we've sent not
[24:10] one to impose this commandment on a
[24:13] gentile. Says, "It seemed good unto us
[24:15] being assembled with one accord to send
[24:17] chosen men unto you with our beloved
[24:19] Barnabas and Paul, men that have
[24:21] hazarded their lives for the name of our
[24:24] Lord Jesus Christ." I love that
[24:25] scripture. We have sent therefore Judas
[24:28] and Silas, who shall also tell you the
[24:29] same things by mouth. For it seemed good
[24:32] to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon
[24:35] you no greater burden than these
[24:37] necessary things. We're not going to
[24:39] impose upon you circumcision. We're
[24:42] going to lighten that load. We're not
[24:44] going to impose that that uh law on you.
[24:47] Says that you abstain. These are ones
[24:48] that they did tell him that they thought
[24:50] that would be agreeable to them. Abstain
[24:52] from meats offered to idols and from
[24:53] blood and from things strangled and from
[24:55] fornication from which if you keep
[24:57] yourselves you shall do well. Fair you
[24:59] well. Uh this just a real simple story
[25:02] just looking at this aspect of how the
[25:04] gospel is now turning to the Jews. Paul
[25:05] being a Roman uh having Roman
[25:07] citizenship has some connection uh with
[25:10] these Gentiles. The gospel turning to
[25:11] the Gentiles from the Jews. He goes he's
[25:14] now uh the gospel is having this impact
[25:16] upon Gentiles. Gentiles are being saved.
[25:19] And now the the OGs apparently are now
[25:22] telling these new guys, well you should
[25:23] be circumcised. We were circumcised. You
[25:26] should be circumcised. It caused a a
[25:28] great contention. And Paul is saying,
[25:30] "We don't uh this is this isn't what we
[25:32] think should be done." And so they go to
[25:34] Jerusalem. They have this conversation.
[25:35] Now, those Jews at Jerusalem want to
[25:37] speak with authority to the church, the
[25:39] Gentiles at Antioch and Syria and
[25:41] Cissia, that you do are not being
[25:44] required to be circumcised. We will not
[25:47] lay upon you this burden to be
[25:49] circumcised. Follow me so far. It's
[25:52] very, it's very simple. And I I mean
[25:54] that I'm not just saying this and all of
[25:56] a sudden I'm going to say something the
[25:56] ending like whoa didn't see that coming.
[25:59] This is very simple. Galatians chapter
[26:01] 2:es 1:5.
[26:05] Now there's a there's a lot of
[26:06] connections to these lang the language
[26:08] that's being used in the book of acts.
[26:09] But now Paul writing to the church of
[26:11] Galatia. Then 14 years after I went up
[26:13] to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took
[26:15] Titus with me also and I went up by
[26:18] revelation and communicated unto them
[26:19] the gospel which I preach among the
[26:21] Gentiles. So you can see the connections
[26:24] to these verses we've read. But
[26:26] privately to them which are of
[26:27] reputation, lest by any means I should
[26:29] run or had run in vain. Notice the
[26:31] discretion he uses. How that he
[26:33] communicates with some, but then he goes
[26:35] privately to them which are of
[26:36] reputation. So he's using discretion in
[26:39] terms of how these things are discussed,
[26:41] how these things are shared. That's not
[26:42] what I want to focus on. But notice
[26:44] verse three. But neither Titus who was
[26:46] with me being a Greek was compelled to
[26:48] be circumcised.
[26:50] And that because of false brethren
[26:52] unawares brought in who came in privy to
[26:54] spy out our liberty which we have in
[26:55] Christ Jesus that they might bring us
[26:57] into bondage to whom we gave place by
[27:01] subjection. No, not for an hour. Why?
[27:04] That the truth of the gospel might
[27:06] continue with you. Now think of this. He
[27:09] he he's making this point that we are we
[27:11] have gone uh he shared how the gospel is
[27:14] preached among the Gentiles and how that
[27:18] Titus being with him who is a Greek uh
[27:20] was compelled to be circumcised
[27:23] but he says we didn't even give place to
[27:25] that at all. We did not give into that.
[27:28] And some might think wow why not? I
[27:30] mean, it's such a maybe a a big ask for
[27:32] Titus, but if he could just get it done,
[27:34] he could he effectively more witness,
[27:36] but him being a Greek, he says, "I'm not
[27:38] going to force him to be circumcised so
[27:40] that the truth of the gospel might
[27:42] continue with you." In other words,
[27:44] there's something that he could have
[27:45] forced Titus to do that would have
[27:46] obscured the gospel to more put more
[27:49] emphasis on something they could have
[27:50] done in their flesh and begin to lead
[27:52] them into bondage of the law instead of
[27:55] recognizing the liberty that Christ was
[27:57] wanting to bring them. But Titus
[27:59] uncircumcised with Paul ministering the
[28:02] gospel was not compelled to be
[28:04] circumcised by Paul. He resisted the
[28:07] notion that the this that Titus should
[28:09] be circumcised. But in acts 16:es 1-5 a
[28:14] little bit different story
[28:17] says then came he to Derby and Lystra
[28:19] and behold a certain disciple was there
[28:21] named Timoththeus the son of a certain
[28:24] woman which was a Jewish and believed
[28:26] but his father was a Greek so he's a Jew
[28:29] by birth to his mom his father is a
[28:32] Greek Titus is referred to as being
[28:34] Greek now Timoththeus is uh both Jew and
[28:38] Greek by birth he said now of these
[28:41] these ones which was well reported of
[28:42] the brethren that were at Lystra and
[28:44] Iconium. So he has a good rapport. We
[28:46] know that his parents, his mom and
[28:48] grandma had good report. Him would Paul
[28:50] have to go forth with him and took and
[28:54] circumcised him because of the Jews
[28:56] which were in those quarters.
[28:59] Little bit different take. Now back I
[29:02] think it was maybe in January, February,
[29:03] brother Eleazar preached on grace
[29:04] through faith. He was even looking at
[29:06] these very things and mentioned it was
[29:08] mentioning Timothy's circumcision but
[29:10] the lack of Titus's circumcision. And so
[29:14] here Titus having been asked uh to be
[29:17] circumcised, Paul says no, he's not
[29:19] going to be circumcised. Where is he?
[29:21] Where was he going to Paul? To the
[29:23] Gentiles. But now he says Paul's going
[29:24] to go forth with them. He took him and
[29:26] circumcised him because of the Jews. I
[29:29] mean, could you imagine Timothy finding
[29:31] out about Titus later on? Said, "Whoa,
[29:33] wait a minute.
[29:34] You didn't make Titus do this, but you
[29:36] made me do this. But he says he did it
[29:39] because of the Jews. For they knew all
[29:40] that his father was a Greek. And as they
[29:42] went through the cities, they delivered
[29:44] him to the decrees for to keep that were
[29:46] ordained to the apostles and elders
[29:47] which are at Jerusalem. And so were the
[29:49] churches established in the faith and
[29:51] increased in number daily.
[29:54] Notice how in each instance the gospel
[29:57] is effective that the effectiveness of
[29:59] the gospel is taken into consideration.
[30:01] And Titus being uh all Greek would not
[30:04] have been expected to be circumcised.
[30:08] But Timothy is asked to be circumcised
[30:10] and he is because of the context of
[30:13] where he's witnessing and the
[30:14] relationship that he would have to these
[30:16] other Jews. Timothy had been accepted or
[30:18] at least it's believed that he was
[30:19] accepted as a Jew since his mother was a
[30:21] Jew. So being circumcised, he would not
[30:24] be discredited by the Jews that they
[30:26] were witnessing to would have been
[30:28] relatable. It it would have ended all
[30:30] objections. They would have known
[30:33] silence them before they could even get
[30:34] started. They could not discredit him.
[30:37] And so it would be this would be
[30:38] something where he'd be relative to the
[30:40] audience.
[30:42] Have you ever heard the phrase win in
[30:43] Rome?
[30:45] It says win in Rome do as the Romans. It
[30:47] sounds like from the chuckles that
[30:49] people use that all the time. Had a
[30:50] business meeting in Vegas.
[30:53] That's what what happens in Vegas stays
[30:54] in Vegas. Different different saying,
[30:56] but when in Rome, do as the Romans do.
[30:58] It's also short shortened to when in
[31:00] Rome. You'd be interesting to find that
[31:02] it's a proverb that's attributed to St.
[31:03] Ambrose and it basically means you know
[31:06] it's best to follow the traditions of
[31:08] customs that are of a place you're
[31:10] visiting and it came about uh and this
[31:13] uh St. Ambrose was a renown theologian
[31:17] in the 300s and one of the most
[31:20] influential ecclesiastical figures of
[31:22] the 4th century. So he's quite a
[31:23] Christian figure. And there was a a a
[31:27] mother and her son St. Augustine I
[31:28] believe is his name was visiting an area
[31:31] and it was their custom to do something
[31:33] on a particular day and uh and so she
[31:37] wrote a letter to St. Ambrose asking him
[31:39] says well they they don't do this here
[31:41] what should we do and he says when I'm
[31:43] somewhere where they observe the Sabbath
[31:44] I will do the same thing and he said so
[31:47] he makes the statement when in Rome and
[31:48] it's it's wasn't in English but this
[31:50] essentially says when in Rome do as the
[31:53] Romans do this isn't a license to if
[31:56] you're with the heathens heathen out
[31:58] right if if they're reprobate just
[32:00] reprobate it's showing that if there's
[32:03] ways people do things if there's customs
[32:06] and traditions avail yourself to that.
[32:09] Why would you do that? So you can be you
[32:11] can relate to them. You can be relatable
[32:13] and there's a way that you can actually
[32:15] be impactful. There's a way that you
[32:17] look at the context of what's happening
[32:19] the situation. Whereas Paul said, "I
[32:21] become all things to all men, to a Jew,
[32:23] a Jew." And he goes, "Not that I would
[32:24] violate the law of Christ. To the extent
[32:26] that I'd be asked to do something
[32:28] against the word of God, I will not do
[32:29] it. But yet I want to become something
[32:32] to somebody else to a Jew a Jew to the
[32:34] weak weak to the gentile a gentile so
[32:36] that I could gain them so that they can
[32:38] hear the gospel and be saved. And this
[32:41] is the same emphasis here whereas uh
[32:43] Titus is not asked to be circumcised
[32:45] because he's going to be re he's re his
[32:47] relationship to those that he's
[32:49] witnessing to but that it would seem fit
[32:51] that Timothy be circumcised for the same
[32:54] reason.
[32:56] If I could put it this way,
[32:59] it was a way of not only u addressing
[33:03] being relatable, but it was becoming it
[33:06] was becoming relevant.
[33:08] And I don't think it's too much of a
[33:09] stretch to say that. And and so what I
[33:12] want to do is I just want to step into
[33:13] what where we were on let your light so
[33:16] shine before men. I think I had a typo
[33:19] in my last my slides on this before. I
[33:22] don't know if I have it here, so chuckle
[33:23] if you like, but I think I have it
[33:25] right. But he says, "Let your light so
[33:27] shine before men." He says, "And we know
[33:29] that the day that we're living today, it
[33:32] pays to advertise."
[33:36] It pays to advertise. And you find out
[33:37] that these people who are making such
[33:39] big progress in business are great men
[33:41] of advertisement.
[33:43] It's the truth.
[33:45] This is where you make your money.
[33:48] It's really summarized uh just as
[33:50] advertisement, but that is such a broad
[33:54] thing today. such a heavy thing, a
[33:56] weighty thing. And and those that are
[33:58] able to place ads in front of people are
[34:01] making money and they're using their
[34:03] data in order to do that, in order to
[34:04] sell. So if something is free, you're
[34:08] the product, you're the commodity. And
[34:10] what they're wanting to use use you to
[34:12] monetize through advertising.
[34:14] And so one of the things I was studying
[34:16] just looking at they say one of the most
[34:18] significant keys to uh marketing success
[34:21] or success in advertising is relevancy
[34:24] to your target audience. So you you want
[34:26] to know who your target audience is and
[34:28] you want to make yourself relevant to
[34:30] those you're targeting.
[34:32] And I remember one time when a friend of
[34:35] my brother Matthews he had friends he
[34:36] had a lot of friends. Uh sound like a
[34:39] Trumpism there. A lot of friends good
[34:40] friends.
[34:42] uh he had a friend who witnessed Matthew
[34:45] start a company by passing out flyers to
[34:47] mow people's lawns. He wanted to go to a
[34:49] friend's wedding and he said, "Let me
[34:51] mow your lawn to help me buy an airline
[34:52] ticket." And it was through that passing
[34:54] out flyers to people that he was able to
[34:56] be start this business and it still
[34:58] continues today as an arborist. So his
[35:00] friend was kind of inspired how Matthew
[35:02] did that and he had an aquarium with
[35:04] some fish and he knew how to clean
[35:05] aquariums. So, he went out and passed
[35:07] out flyers, thousands of flyers to
[35:09] people and didn't get one call. And I
[35:12] overheard him talking to Matthew like,
[35:13] "Man, I can't believe it. You passed out
[35:15] flyers and you made a bunch of money and
[35:16] you started this company. I've passed
[35:18] out thousands of flyers and nobody
[35:19] called me back." And I just said, "If
[35:20] you could just excuse me for a moment,
[35:22] I'd just like to make an observation." I
[35:23] said, "Matthew knew that everyone he was
[35:25] handing a flyer to at least had a lawn."
[35:29] I said, "You have no idea whether or not
[35:31] anybody who got your flyer owned a fish
[35:34] tank or an aquarium." Said, "It's like
[35:36] passing out a pool cleaning service at a
[35:38] hotel or an apartment complex. Nobody
[35:41] owns the pool. Nobody's going to pay for
[35:42] cleaning." And so, this was that just a
[35:44] real simple example of how that you want
[35:46] to know who your target audience is. And
[35:48] if you have your target audience, you
[35:50] want to be relevant to them. There's a
[35:52] study that came out a few years ago
[35:53] where it said 90% of consumers find it
[35:55] annoying to receive messages that aren't
[35:58] personally relevant to them. And we all
[35:59] said, "Amen."
[36:03] That's why just this little, you know,
[36:05] family disclosure here. I don't let my
[36:08] wife use my account because I don't want
[36:10] them trying to sell me wife things,
[36:13] right? The algorithm is going to start
[36:14] telling me, "You need flour." I'm like,
[36:16] "No, no, I don't. I don't need those
[36:18] kind of sandals. I don't wear those kind
[36:20] of clothes. Right? Because they're
[36:22] mining this data and they want to put
[36:24] something in front of you and they want
[36:25] to make it relevant. And it's annoying
[36:27] when something is pitched to you that's
[36:29] not relevant to you. I would say the
[36:30] worst is when you search for something
[36:32] and you bought it and for the rest of
[36:34] your life they advertise it to you and
[36:36] then one day you find out that it's
[36:37] cheaper and it gets cheaper and cheaper
[36:39] or the new one comes out and I just wish
[36:40] you could just shut it down. I bought
[36:41] it. I'm done. I don't want to hear about
[36:43] it anymore. But that's all the things
[36:45] that we relate to when it comes to
[36:47] advertising in marketing. And one of the
[36:49] most important things I wanted to point
[36:50] out one of the most important things
[36:52] when brother said it pays to advertise
[36:54] in advertising. One of the most
[36:56] important things is relevance.
[36:58] There was an article back in 2014. It's
[37:00] the nineletter word every marketer needs
[37:02] to remember at all times. Marketers
[37:04] write this down. Nineletter word that
[37:07] every marketer needs to remember at all
[37:09] times. If you've done the math, it's
[37:11] relevance. And this is what he said. He
[37:13] said, "In case any marketers and
[37:14] advertisers forgot, the word relevance
[37:17] is an adjective meaning having direct
[37:19] bearing on the matter in hand,
[37:21] pertinent." In marketing advertising
[37:23] terms, it means providing your customer
[37:25] and a prospect for that matter with
[37:27] content that is relevant to them.
[37:31] Now, you know, some of you social media
[37:33] influencers that sit here tonight may be
[37:35] able to benefit from this, but I'm
[37:37] talking about as Christians. I'm just
[37:38] wanting to make this applicable as
[37:39] Christians.
[37:41] And and another article that was written
[37:42] in the Harvest Business Review in 2018,
[37:46] it says marketers need to stop focusing
[37:47] on loyalty and start thinking about
[37:49] relevance. It's one of the big things of
[37:52] brand loyalty. Make sure they're loyal
[37:53] to uh uh uh uh to your brand. Well,
[37:56] let's forget about loyal. I mean loyalty
[37:59] and you say this is something you should
[38:00] focus on, but it's relevance. A key
[38:02] component of becoming a living business
[38:04] is conveying exactly the right message,
[38:06] experience, or offer to customers in the
[38:08] ex in exactly the right context. And
[38:11] they call it the era of relevance. The
[38:14] end of the era of loyalty, the era of
[38:16] relevance. Now, think of that in terms
[38:18] of this is the this is the marketing
[38:20] side of things. And I'm a poor person to
[38:21] do it. There's other people here that
[38:23] would be more qualified to speak on this
[38:25] academic side uh and building a brand
[38:27] and the story side of things, but I'm
[38:29] wanting to just draw some of these
[38:30] principles out to show you there was a
[38:32] time when people were focused on getting
[38:34] people to be loyal to the brand. And it
[38:38] was somewhat self-s serving in that well
[38:40] become brand loyalist a and and and try
[38:43] to convince people to be loyal and
[38:44] that's why you have uh VIP cards and MVP
[38:47] cards and all sorts of cards and
[38:48] frequent flyer mile numbers and elite
[38:50] numbers and statuses and you're going to
[38:52] get cents off at your grocery. They
[38:53] wanted to make you loyal. Loyalty cards,
[38:55] loyalty points, but I said there's a
[38:58] shift away from that to where now what
[39:00] you need to do is you need to be
[39:01] relevant to the consumer. not just
[39:03] asking for loyalty to the the content
[39:06] creator or the one that's sharing
[39:08] something or the one that's selling
[39:09] something, but you want to be relevant
[39:11] to them.
[39:15] Now, I I want to riff on that a little
[39:17] bit, but let me read this statement
[39:18] before I do so that I don't lose
[39:20] everybody and think, when did this turn
[39:21] into marketing 101? And let your light
[39:23] so shine before men. He says, "So it
[39:26] pays off for that." What did he say? I I
[39:29] I know that the day we're living in
[39:31] today, it pays to advertise and people
[39:33] are making big money. He's saying great
[39:35] men of advertisement. So if it pays off
[39:38] for that, I begin to think then why
[39:40] won't Christianity pay off if it's
[39:42] advertised? Right? And think of this. He
[39:44] says, well, I thought then what is
[39:46] advertisement? Now think of this shift
[39:48] away from loyalty to relevance. And I
[39:51] believe this is actually where we are
[39:52] today. There's a lot of pandering to the
[39:54] church because the church has demanded
[39:56] your loyalty
[39:58] and and you and we're loyal to the
[40:00] church. We're loyal to the the function
[40:02] of things. And in reality though, what
[40:04] the real heart of the gospel is so that
[40:06] you it can be relevant to you. Not just
[40:08] loyalty to a a house, not to loyalty to
[40:11] a name, but something is actually
[40:12] relevant to you.
[40:15] He says, "Then what is advertisement?"
[40:18] He says, "You've got to have something
[40:20] that's a little different from what the
[40:21] rest of them's got or if it's just so
[40:23] common like the things of the world,
[40:25] it'll never attract the attention of the
[40:26] people." He's drawing from a real world
[40:28] example where he saw the impact a
[40:31] billboard had and how that begins to
[40:33] work. And he we read some statements
[40:34] before about how it first has to be seen
[40:36] and then once it's seen uh then it has
[40:38] to impact that one who they have to want
[40:41] it. So he says, "But if it's just it has
[40:43] to be something different than what
[40:45] everybody else has. If we're just
[40:47] demanding loyalty to creeds, then find
[40:50] the creeds that are a little that you
[40:52] can vibe with, right? Find the creeds
[40:54] that let you do what you want, like show
[40:56] up on a Sunday in your shorts and watch
[40:58] the Super Bowl at the same time."
[41:05] He said, "If it's just common like
[41:07] everything else, it'll never attract the
[41:08] attention of people." Now, if a man
[41:10] would have been looking for an
[41:11] automobile, he would have went on past
[41:12] that sign. What sign? Hungry. If what he
[41:15] needed was an automobile, that sign
[41:17] wouldn't have wouldn't have uh caught
[41:18] his attention. But if he'd been hungry,
[41:20] he'd have been looking for that sign.
[41:22] What would what is it? It's relevant.
[41:25] The sign was relevant to the need. Now,
[41:27] if somebody needs an automobile, then
[41:29] you have that sign that's advertising
[41:30] automobiles and it meets that need. But
[41:32] he's saying to the one that was hungry,
[41:34] that sign was relevant to his need. He
[41:37] says, "So I believe that the Christian
[41:39] is God's billboard. I believe that each
[41:42] one of us is God's billboard and we
[41:44] don't have to do so much of carrying on
[41:46] about as we do. Just simply live such a
[41:50] life that'll make the people hungry to
[41:52] be like you."
[41:54] Do you realize that's the relevance?
[41:56] People who want hope, they want peace,
[41:58] they want satisfaction, they want
[41:59] happiness, they don't want a bunch of
[42:01] carrying on. Bunch of carrying on, you
[42:02] can find it somewhere else. I promise
[42:03] you that if you want to be Pentecostal,
[42:05] move to Alexandria, Louisiana, and just
[42:08] join up with the Pentecost of
[42:10] Alexandria, attend because of the times
[42:12] and and go to all their services and
[42:14] enjoy the worship and be true
[42:15] Pentecostals,
[42:17] if that's what you want. But if you want
[42:20] to live the life,
[42:22] you got to have the life. You got to
[42:23] have the word. Says we don't want to
[42:26] have so much carrying on about as we do.
[42:28] Just simply live such a life that'll
[42:30] make the people hungry to be like you.
[42:31] That's how you're God's billboard. And
[42:34] what is he saying? He's saying that's
[42:35] what will make you relevant
[42:37] because it'll speak to a need that the
[42:39] person has. It'll speak to the real
[42:41] what's pertinent.
[42:43] In case anyone forgot the word relevance
[42:46] means something that has a bearing on
[42:47] the matter at hand. Something that's
[42:48] pertinent. That's what we want to know.
[42:50] We want to be relevant to people as
[42:54] witnesses in our family, to our
[42:55] children. Whatever the relationships we
[42:56] have, we want to be real. We want to be
[42:58] relatable. But then it also needs to be
[42:59] relevant. Right? We're not telling
[43:01] people to go build an ark.
[43:04] We're not telling people to go kill a
[43:05] lamb and put blood on the doorpost and
[43:06] lentil literally something relevant. If
[43:08] someone needs divine healing, you want
[43:10] to that you want to bring them to that
[43:11] relevant place in scripture to testify
[43:13] divine healing.
[43:15] I believe what brother Brown's
[43:17] identifying here is where the context
[43:20] matters. The relationship matters. He
[43:23] said it pays off in the business world.
[43:25] Wouldn't it pay off for Christianity?
[43:26] Amen. if we advertised the same if we
[43:28] took that same kind of principle that
[43:30] I'm God's billboard. I'm an
[43:31] advertisement for the word of God. And
[43:34] so I want my life to express
[43:37] a a satisfaction to the need that
[43:40] someone may have.
[43:42] Couple scriptures to close. One in
[43:43] Romans chapter 11 to verse 17.
[43:50] He says, "For I long to see you that I
[43:52] may impart unto you some spiritual gift
[43:54] to the end you may be established." Paul
[43:56] just writing these things at the
[43:57] beginning of the book of Romans. He says
[43:59] that is that I may be comforted together
[44:00] with you by the mutual faith both of you
[44:03] and me. Now I would not have you
[44:05] ignorant brethren that often times I
[44:07] purposed to come unto you but was let
[44:09] hither too that I might have some fruit
[44:11] among you also even as among other
[44:14] Gentiles. Then he this is the part that
[44:16] I really wanted to focus on. He says I
[44:18] am debtor both to the Greeks and to the
[44:20] barbarians both to the wise and to the
[44:22] unwise. I have a duty. I want to be a
[44:26] witness to I need to take into
[44:27] consideration the Greeks, the
[44:28] barbarians, the wise and the unwise, to
[44:30] the unruly and the civilized. That I'm a
[44:33] debtor to them. We're servants to them.
[44:35] We're witnesses to them. That we we
[44:38] don't if we are wise, we don't make
[44:41] ourselves
[44:43] uh
[44:45] so we we
[44:47] there's no uh
[44:51] pomp to our our testimony. We're not
[44:53] trying to impress somebody. We're not
[44:56] wanting to look down and prove to the
[44:58] unwise that we're better than them. He
[44:59] says, "But I'm a debtor. I'm a debtor to
[45:01] Greeks, to the barbarians, both to the
[45:03] wise and to the unwise." So he says, "So
[45:05] as much as is in it is in me, I am ready
[45:08] to preach the gospel to you that are at
[45:10] Rome also." This is what his citizenship
[45:13] afforded him the ability to do. Gave him
[45:15] great liberty. The fact that he was a
[45:17] Roman, it was relevant to the witness
[45:19] that God wanted him to be. Said, "I'm
[45:20] going to send you as a light to lighten
[45:22] the Gentiles. I'm going to cause you to
[45:23] go and bring the gospel to the Gentiles.
[45:25] And his Roman citizenship was part of
[45:27] this plan of God to even bring him to
[45:29] Rome because as a citizen, he appealed
[45:31] to Rome as much as is with me in me. I
[45:34] want to preach the gospel to you because
[45:35] I am in debt as a servant of God to to
[45:38] be a witness to the Greeks, to the
[45:39] barbarians, to the wise, and the unwise.
[45:41] Then he makes these great statements
[45:43] that we all remember so well. For I'm
[45:44] not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. For
[45:46] it is the power of God under salvation,
[45:48] to everyone that believeth to the Jew
[45:50] first, and also to the Greek.
[45:53] For therein is the righteousness of God
[45:55] revealed from faith to faith. From his
[45:58] faith to their faith, as it is written,
[46:00] the just shall live by faith.
[46:03] From faith to faith, as the faith is
[46:05] preached, as the word is believed, it
[46:08] excites the faith in another. to the Jew
[46:11] to the Greek, from the Jew to the Greek,
[46:14] the Greek to the Jew, all working
[46:15] together as a debtor to the Greeks and
[46:17] to the barbarians, both to the wise and
[46:18] the unwise. That's the responsibility we
[46:20] have as witnesses.
[46:23] And I believe that the same burden is on
[46:25] us in this hour. And though we're
[46:26] reading this in the context of the book
[46:28] of Acts and the relationship between
[46:31] those who would be Jews who are
[46:32] circumcised or or or non-Jews being
[46:35] asked to be circumcised, it's still
[46:38] today we are God's billboards and you
[46:40] have an audience. There's a target
[46:42] audience. God wants to reach them. And
[46:45] you may be uniquely qualified to reach
[46:46] people that others aren't able to do.
[46:48] Yes. And so God has called you just as
[46:51] Paul was built a certain way, just as
[46:52] Titus was a certain way, just as Timothy
[46:54] was a certain way. There's ways that the
[46:56] gospel can be preached and lived and
[46:58] expressed through you that's not just
[47:00] cookie cutter. That's not let's not
[47:03] we're not all trying to twist arms and
[47:04] get people to come to Arizona believers
[47:06] church so they can really hear the
[47:07] gospel preached in his pure form. No,
[47:09] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[47:11] forever. And the goal is that others
[47:13] would have a personal revel revelation
[47:16] of Jesus Christ. That life being excited
[47:18] inside them would lead them to that
[47:19] place of worship and fellowship where
[47:21] they can be taught the word of God and
[47:22] grow in Christ. And it doesn't all have
[47:24] to be in the same place.
[47:29] But our lives need to be billboards
[47:33] because it pays to advertise.
[47:37] Maybe we could look at it this way that
[47:39] God will pay to advertise. There's a
[47:40] blessing in it. Let's get into
[47:43] marketing.
[47:45] Developers, developers, developers,
[47:47] right? Let's get into this. Let's become
[47:49] brand evangelists for the gospel. In
[47:51] Habac chapter 2, musicians, you could
[47:53] come. I'm just going to close on this.
[47:54] Habac chapter 2:es 2:4.
[47:57] He said, 'The just shall live by faith.
[48:01] Romans 1:18 17, the righteousness of God
[48:04] is revealed from faith to faith as it is
[48:06] written, the just shall live by faith.
[48:08] What was he calling on? Habac chapter 2.
[48:10] And the Lord answered me and said, write
[48:12] the vision and make it plain upon tables
[48:15] that he may run that readeth it. Notice
[48:19] that there's a vision given. One
[48:20] receives the vision, one hears it, one
[48:22] sees it. But he is to write it upon a
[48:25] table
[48:27] and not obscure it. It's to be printed.
[48:29] It's to be etched
[48:31] so that the one that reads it can run
[48:34] properly.
[48:36] It's not a vague billboard like the one
[48:39] you see on your way to Tucson, the
[48:40] thing. Like, what is what even is that,
[48:43] right? You know, it's just it's it's so
[48:47] ambiguous.
[48:48] That's not what God's after. Hungry
[48:50] really gets you thinking. Hungry. You
[48:52] begin to think something something's
[48:55] pulling on me. Yes, I I have an
[48:56] appetite. So, it's to be made plain.
[48:59] Make it plain so that others who read
[49:01] it, those that hear it can run, can be
[49:04] uh uh excited by the vision, know what
[49:06] it's saying and and respond to it
[49:08] appropriately. For the vision is yet for
[49:09] an appointed time, but at the end it
[49:11] shall speak and not lie.
[49:13] Though it tar, wait for it because it
[49:15] will surely come, it will not tar. Paul
[49:17] catches the revelation of this and he
[49:19] knows that the vision which is in it
[49:20] here is Christ. He's the one that comes.
[49:24] He's the one that speaks. He's the one
[49:25] that's revealed himself in this end
[49:26] time. He says, "Behold, his soul which
[49:28] is lifted up is not upright in him. But
[49:30] the just shall live by his faith."
[49:34] We're living in a time when not only
[49:35] does he have to be revealed to you. And
[49:37] you know that he's real and you know
[49:39] that he's living inside of you and he is
[49:42] playing it as a vision. You've got to
[49:44] make it plain. Let it be written in the
[49:46] tables of your heart that it might be
[49:47] lived out simply so that it can make
[49:50] people to be hungry like you. Lord, I do
[49:52] want to be your billboard. That the the
[49:54] vision can be etched in my life and that
[49:56] through my response to difficulties and
[49:58] circumstances, the way that I raise my
[50:00] children, the way that I handle defeat,
[50:02] the way that I handle loss, the way that
[50:03] I even handle breakups and and
[50:05] backsliden children, whatever it may be,
[50:07] that in that I demonstrate the power of
[50:10] the gospel
[50:11] and I make it plain upon those tables
[50:13] that others may see and run to it.
[50:15] Others would come to find the same
[50:17] vision real in their hearts.
[50:19] I I approached this in a very unique way
[50:22] just even from my my own vantage point.
[50:25] I I I know what I'm looking at and
[50:27] there's a lot more that could be said
[50:28] about this, but there's a lot to think
[50:30] about in terms of our witness and our
[50:32] testimony being relevant.
[50:34] And now sometimes we try to force
[50:36] something and it's like, well, look at
[50:37] the context of what you're forcing it
[50:39] into. When you do that, how is it how is
[50:42] it relational to what you're trying to
[50:44] accomplish?
[50:45] I'm not trying to make it complicated
[50:47] like this is advertising and and and
[50:49] marketing. We need to figure out how we
[50:50] can get better branding. Just live a
[50:53] life.
[50:55] Just live a simple life. Not a much of
[50:57] carrying on, but know that God has a way
[51:00] that that he has. It pays to advertise.
[51:02] It pays to use billboards. That's the
[51:04] success of the gospel is not so much
[51:06] what we do here, but it's what you do
[51:08] out of these doors. That's going to be
[51:10] the greatest success of this church is
[51:12] not what we do here, but what you do
[51:13] outside.
[51:15] And you're you're called to it. You've
[51:16] got it. You guys have it. You have the
[51:18] goods. You've got the you have the
[51:20] capacity to turn Arizona upside down.
[51:23] Not with a bunch of carrying on, but by
[51:25] living a simple life. God, help us to be
[51:27] his witnesses. If you could stand
[51:29] together with me.
[51:31] Pray for me, my family, and I as we
[51:33] leave super early in the morning. We're
[51:34] going to be up 4:00 in the morning or
[51:36] so, and getting on the road
[51:40] heading to Europe. We got several
[51:42] services this weekend. We just covet
[51:43] your prayers and may God be with you
[51:45] while we're away. Let's just pray
[51:47] together. Heavenly Father, consider it a
[51:49] great privilege to be in your presence
[51:50] tonight. And Lord, I realize that just
[51:54] piecing together lengthy readings can be
[51:56] laborious, Lord, for the listener.
[51:59] But I trust that those who are here
[52:01] tonight with their attentiveness and
[52:02] their anticipation, they were able just
[52:04] to kind of pick out uh some of these
[52:06] small details
[52:09] and make them relevant to their own
[52:11] lives.
[52:14] Lord, there's families here that will
[52:18] live in circles where the gospel needs
[52:20] to touch people.
[52:23] And Lord, may they embrace that role,
[52:27] to that neighborhood, to that family, to
[52:29] those people that they're called to.
[52:32] And Lord, not so much that they would
[52:34] need to drag them out of their community
[52:36] and bring them here to Phoenix or church
[52:38] here and
[52:40] so that they could participate in a
[52:41] church service, but Lord, so that your
[52:43] light would shine where they are.
[52:46] Lord, we would love it if in doing so
[52:49] there would be those who would call upon
[52:50] your name to be saved and that there
[52:51] could be baptisms even here in our own
[52:53] baptismal that we could be see souls
[52:56] added to the church that could grow in
[52:57] your word, live in the light of this
[53:00] hour. Lord, that's truly our desire. But
[53:02] that part's up to you. May we do our
[53:06] part
[53:07] to be these billboards,
[53:10] these tables of flesh in which the
[53:13] vision is being written plainly
[53:16] so that through living the life we could
[53:17] be advertising Christ, peace and hope
[53:19] and joy, the fruits of the spirit, the
[53:21] very purpose of the fruits of the
[53:22] spirit, Lord, is to advertise.
[53:25] Lord, I pray that you help us to be more
[53:27] faithful to this cause through the
[53:29] simplicity of this service tonight. I
[53:31] trust that people would be encouraged.
[53:34] We love you, Lord. We ask all this in
[53:35] the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
