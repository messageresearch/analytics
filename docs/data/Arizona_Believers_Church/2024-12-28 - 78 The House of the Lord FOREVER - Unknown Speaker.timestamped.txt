[0:00] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[0:04] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[0:05] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[0:08] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[0:12] in the paths of righteousness for his
[0:14] name's sake yay though I walk through
[0:16] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[0:18] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[0:21] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[0:24] preparest a table before me in the
[0:26] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[0:28] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[0:31] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[0:33] me all the days of my life and I will
[0:36] dwell in the house of the Lord
[0:40] forever amen praise the Lord surely
[0:43] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[0:45] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[0:48] the house of the Lord forever amen you
[0:52] can be
[0:55] seated my title today uh when I was
[0:58] originally working on it and just trying
[1:00] to come to a conclusion of this series
[1:02] on the house of the Lord my title was
[1:04] forever and if you'd like just maybe jot
[1:07] that down you could just use that as the
[1:08] title in your notes if you'd like but uh
[1:11] just wanted to present it this way and
[1:12] just title it this way uh the house of
[1:15] the Lord
[1:17] forever and drawing uh to a conclusion
[1:20] of series and as you end a series
[1:22] there's a lot of things that goes
[1:23] through my mind to where I was tempted
[1:26] just to feed all my notes into uh Gemini
[1:28] and ask it to produce a a summary that
[1:31] could be uh concisely given in an hour
[1:34] uh I avoided that cuz you there's just
[1:36] so much you'd want to share so many
[1:37] things you want to express when you
[1:38] bring something to an end but I feel
[1:40] today as we look at this uh thought of
[1:42] forever in the context of the house of
[1:45] the Lord forever drawn specifically from
[1:47] Psalms 23 I think it'll just uh
[1:49] hopefully hit the mark for myself
[1:51] personally but even more so for you all
[1:54] and as it is the end of a series we're
[1:56] also looking at the end of a year as
[1:58] this year draws to an end and then also
[2:00] a beginning of a new year I was thinking
[2:03] about it this past week how unique this
[2:05] timing is that you have the ending of a
[2:07] thing in the beginning of another and
[2:10] the ending joins with this beginning so
[2:12] to me it just feels like a really unique
[2:14] time where you can say definitively uh a
[2:17] year has passed it is over it's done and
[2:21] good thing we don't write many checks
[2:22] anymore so we don't have to worry about
[2:23] putting 2024 on the check when we date
[2:26] it and uh a lot of our calendars change
[2:28] automatically CU they're dig but for
[2:30] those of us who still have an analog
[2:32] calendar or whatever we call that how
[2:34] many people is it going to stay on
[2:35] August 2022 still uh that calendar that
[2:38] sits in our office but there's a lot of
[2:40] things you turn the page and things are
[2:42] flipping around and it's just a really
[2:43] unique time where there's an ending and
[2:45] there's a beginning and it does to me it
[2:48] brought into view just God's promises to
[2:50] us and his uh his presence with us as
[2:53] Revelations chap 22:13 says I am Alpha
[2:56] and Omega the beginning and the end the
[2:59] first in the LA and the last so it's a
[3:02] moment that we can as we see an ending
[3:05] of a thing and a beginning we can view
[3:06] Christ the end and the beginning as he
[3:09] says he's the beginning and the end he's
[3:11] the Alpha and the Omega no matter how
[3:12] you want to flip it around it's Christ
[3:14] he's there in these two different
[3:16] endings and this beginning and as we
[3:20] close out the end and as things finish a
[3:22] lot of times our minds are on what's
[3:24] been pasted and it's important for us to
[3:26] have a Clear Vision for the future and
[3:28] so I want to encourage you today through
[3:30] the word of God in this very moment
[3:31] where we are December 29th the ending of
[3:33] a year the beginning of a new one this
[3:35] was kind of a New Year's message it may
[3:37] seem to be cliche but I want to impress
[3:40] this upon you in this sense Deuteronomy
[3:43] 11:12 it says in the land which the Lord
[3:45] thy God carth for so the land which God
[3:48] cares for I think you could put yourself
[3:50] in that that I am his possession I am uh
[3:54] uh part of his desire and what his eyes
[3:56] are towards the land which thy Lord God
[3:57] carth for the eyes of the Lord God are
[4:00] always upon it from the beginning of the
[4:02] year even until the end of the year God
[4:06] himself is watching out over the
[4:08] calendar as it were at from the
[4:10] beginning to the end and so we could
[4:12] look back and say Lord I know that your
[4:14] eyes have been upon me from the
[4:16] beginning of the year now to the end and
[4:18] not so much looking back to how he has
[4:20] been with us uh we probably don't
[4:23] necessarily do that very much but we
[4:24] start looking forward to how he'll be
[4:27] with us in the beginning of the year
[4:29] until to the end and I'm being I just
[4:32] felt like the timing of this was
[4:33] beautiful bringing this to this series
[4:35] to a close using this scripture in
[4:37] Psalms 23 I think it's just uh very
[4:39] encouraging to me to see it line up
[4:41] because I do want to address our past
[4:44] and some of you might be getting nervous
[4:45] thinking no let's just leave that alone
[4:48] but I do think it's good sometimes for
[4:50] us to at least consider it for a moment
[4:53] and address things past and give
[4:56] perspective to things past and not so
[4:59] much the ghost of Christmas Past or the
[5:01] Ghost of Christmas present and Ghost of
[5:02] Christmas future but looking to the past
[5:05] and looking at things that have been but
[5:07] giving perspective to those things so it
[5:09] would enable us to go forward properly
[5:12] we could be bound down by so many things
[5:14] and uh held back by memories and
[5:16] consciousness of certain mistakes and
[5:18] failures but as Joshua was getting ready
[5:20] to enter into the promised land God told
[5:23] him I am with you wherever you go the
[5:26] Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou
[5:28] goest and he said be of good courage and
[5:30] don't be fearful and just observe to do
[5:32] those things that you know that you
[5:33] ought to do and it was kind of giving
[5:36] him perspective as I was with Moses I
[5:38] will be with you so he's saying look
[5:40] back and understand that I've what God
[5:43] has done and what he was doing in being
[5:45] with you but now go forward and press on
[5:47] towards the promise that is there in
[5:50] Ecclesiastes 7:8 it says better is the
[5:53] end of a thing than the beginning
[5:56] thereof that's uh quite a statement I
[5:59] think that would would be that would
[6:00] Merit maybe a lot more thought than I'm
[6:02] just going to give it right now but when
[6:04] you think how God says the word says
[6:07] it's the end of a thing is better than
[6:08] the beginning that's a that's a pretty
[6:11] good goal for the new year right like if
[6:14] the end is going to be better but I
[6:15] think sometimes we stop and we think
[6:17] well I had such such Hope on January 1st
[6:20] 2024 it was such an awesome start and
[6:23] then you look at the very end you're
[6:24] like I don't know if the end is better
[6:26] than the beginning started out really
[6:28] good a lot of uh I'm going to do this
[6:30] and I'm going to do that and these
[6:31] things are going to happen you look back
[6:32] at your bucket list and you realize you
[6:33] fulfilled none of them H and maybe
[6:35] there's a lot of things you're dragging
[6:37] into the new year but we can believe
[6:38] this as a goal for the new year that if
[6:40] it starts as this is ending now I want
[6:43] to be able to see This Promise of God
[6:45] that better is the end than the
[6:46] beginning knowing that as this new year
[6:50] begins we can say Lord I want the end to
[6:53] be better according to your promise
[6:55] according to all that you have said in
[6:57] your word as I dedicate my as you told
[7:00] Joshua to observe to do all that I've
[7:02] been
[7:03] commanded and trust that this could be a
[7:06] a help to you today in this using this
[7:09] subject of the house of the Lord Forever
[7:13] at this ending of a year and the
[7:14] beginning of a new one now now that the
[7:16] cliche is out of the way let's look back
[7:18] at Psalms
[7:19] 23 verses 1 to6 if you could just let's
[7:23] just read through this again because I'm
[7:25] I'm drawing from verse six there's a a
[7:27] lot in these first five verses that are
[7:30] worth uh tremendous uh uh consideration
[7:34] just to think about the Lord is my
[7:36] shepherd I shall not want I will not
[7:39] lack he maketh me to lie down in Green
[7:43] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[7:45] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[7:49] in the paths of righteousness for his
[7:51] name's sake there is a making there's a
[7:53] leading there's a restoring he says he
[7:55] restoreth my soul many writers when they
[7:58] look at this and even to the Hebrew
[8:01] tradition they saw that these are liken
[8:04] unto one who has fallen and made a
[8:06] mistake maybe even those who were uh
[8:08] going to be in uh Exile coming back to
[8:11] the temple coming back to the house of
[8:13] the Lord being restored back to
[8:15] something that has been lost says yay
[8:17] though I walk through the valley of the
[8:19] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[8:22] thou art with me and there's that key
[8:24] his presence is with him thou art with
[8:27] me so even though I'm walking through
[8:28] the valley of the shadow of death I know
[8:31] you're with me brother Bram takes that
[8:33] scripture he says how do we know doesn't
[8:35] necessarily ask the question he says the
[8:36] shadow declares that there's light
[8:38] shining somewhere so the shadow of death
[8:41] still testifies that there's light
[8:43] shining the AO I walk through the valley
[8:45] of the shadow of death I will fear no
[8:47] evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[8:49] thy staff they comfort
[8:51] me great truths represented by this rod
[8:54] and the staff and how they are Comfort
[8:57] to David he knows he's with him and his
[9:01] presence is declared through this rod
[9:02] and this staff he's making me he's
[9:04] restoring me he's leading me in Psalms
[9:06] 27 this this parallel to even this this
[9:09] verse here is though an enemy is around
[9:11] about me I will not fear because the
[9:13] Lord you are my light I will not fear
[9:15] what man could do to me because you are
[9:17] my salvation and though they a host
[9:19] gather against me I will be confident in
[9:21] your presence so there's this tremendous
[9:23] parallel with psalms 27 says in verse 5
[9:26] thou preparest a table before me in the
[9:29] presence of mine enemies th anointest my
[9:31] head with oil my cup
[9:37] runthe 6 in Psalms 27 now will my head
[9:40] be lifted up above my enemies I'm
[9:42] feasting in the presence of my enemies
[9:45] very important to recognize this it's
[9:47] not that God brings you far away from
[9:48] your enemies or even banishes your
[9:51] enemies to a torment but in this moment
[9:54] he is giving you a feast and you're
[9:56] feasting in the presence of your enemies
[10:00] and then this verse here surely goodness
[10:02] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[10:05] of my life and I will dwell in the house
[10:08] of the Lord
[10:10] forever it partners with one thing have
[10:12] I desired of the Lord that will I seek
[10:14] after that I may dwell in the house of
[10:16] the Lord and I may inquire in his Temple
[10:20] that I may behold his Beauty for in a
[10:23] time of trouble he will hide me so
[10:24] there's this uh these parallel passages
[10:26] in Psalms 23 and Psalms 27 I think are
[10:29] good good good for us to keep in mind
[10:30] just because of the weight and
[10:32] significance of the prophecy in Psalms
[10:35] 27 and here David is seeming to prophesy
[10:38] I will dwell in the house of the Lord
[10:42] forever forever it speaks of throughout
[10:44] all my days the word as I was studying
[10:48] it in uh in the Hebrew it's imper
[10:51] petu where there's no ending date it's
[10:53] that quality of lasting
[10:56] forever and for the real estate Minds
[10:58] that are here this it's just this
[11:00] example to me helped me to understand
[11:02] what is meant but imp perpetuity uh
[11:04] essentially Without End when you hold a
[11:06] fee simple absolute if I was going to
[11:08] sell you a property that's how you'd
[11:09] want to have title is fee simple
[11:11] absolute which means you have full
[11:13] complete total ownership of the piece of
[11:16] real estate and there's no nothing that
[11:19] would impair your ability to sell it to
[11:21] dispose of it or determine who gets it
[11:23] after you die that means you totally own
[11:25] it and it's yours forever during your
[11:28] lifetime and you choose who gets it when
[11:30] you die there's a lot of title that
[11:33] people can hold it says you can have
[11:34] this in your lifetime but when you die
[11:36] it goes to brother
[11:38] Aaron whichever brother Aaron that might
[11:40] be and that that means there's a
[11:41] restriction on your ability to do
[11:43] anything with it sometimes you can hold
[11:44] title and you have to use it for
[11:46] particular purpose but if you use it for
[11:48] any other purpose title goes back to the
[11:50] person who has the fee simple
[11:52] absolute and so when David says I will
[11:55] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[11:57] he he doesn't fix an ending date to it
[12:00] it it speaks of some sort of ownership
[12:02] and relationship and control we know
[12:05] that the term forever can be used to
[12:07] designate a a specific space of time or
[12:11] it could be used in a way to I speak of
[12:14] something that's an in has an
[12:15] indeterminate end but yet you would know
[12:17] that eventually it would end but David
[12:20] here is not limiting his habitation in
[12:22] the house of Lord to Eternity and I want
[12:25] to I want you to recognize that he's not
[12:27] just saying one day in eternity I will
[12:29] dwell there and he's not limiting to a
[12:31] space of time in his natural
[12:34] life it's not a brevity was reading in
[12:38] uh I think it was just maybe poetry just
[12:40] how there was Beauty and brevity
[12:42] sometimes there could be real Beauty in
[12:44] things that are just uh brief and summed
[12:46] up and our lives the Bible says in James
[12:49] 4:14 whereas you know not what shall be
[12:52] on the tomorrow for what is your life it
[12:54] is even a vapor that appear for a little
[12:56] time and then vanisheth away we're
[12:59] admonished in the scripture to realize
[13:00] that we have no guarantee of tomorrow to
[13:02] not think so much of ourselves to think
[13:04] that tomorrow morning the sun will rise
[13:06] on my life just as much as it has all
[13:09] these other days of my life and I will
[13:10] have another opportunity to make wrongs
[13:12] right and do the things that I should
[13:14] but we have a our lives are considered a
[13:16] vapor it's the shortness of life life is
[13:19] not uh guaranteed to so many days it's
[13:22] not permanent this life will one day
[13:24] have an
[13:25] end when David says I will dwell in the
[13:28] house of the Lord
[13:29] forever it does not refer
[13:33] to uh an eternal presence in after death
[13:38] or well one day when I die I will have
[13:41] an eternal presence in heaven or I will
[13:43] dwell in heaven forever but he's
[13:45] speaking about right
[13:47] now in Psalms 27:13 it said I had
[13:50] fainted unless I had believed to see the
[13:53] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[13:55] living for many years when I looked at
[13:58] the scripture I used it in the context
[14:01] of a Rapture and that the land of the
[14:03] living would be a place of resurrection
[14:05] and it would be something Eternal and as
[14:07] I've looked at this more and even some
[14:09] of these prophecies surrounding this I
[14:11] realized that David was saying I would
[14:12] have been discouraged and I would have
[14:15] fainted and I would have given up had I
[14:16] not believed that I would see the
[14:18] goodness of the Lord in the land of
[14:20] living though it may pertain to the hope
[14:22] that we have in the afterlife David was
[14:24] saying that his abiding presence is with
[14:27] me now that if if if I didn't know that
[14:30] God could be with me now if I didn't
[14:32] believe that I would see the goodness of
[14:34] God now in the land of the living where
[14:36] people live and not in the land of the
[14:38] Eternal but if I didn't believe his
[14:40] goodness was with me now I would have
[14:42] just wanted to
[14:43] quit and go to that place
[14:46] beyond we know that there is no end to
[14:48] God's presence it reaches from eternity
[14:51] to
[14:52] Eternity and it is his presence in this
[14:54] scripture he says surely goodness and
[14:56] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[14:58] life and and I will dwell in the house
[15:00] of the Lord forever the house of the
[15:01] Lord designates his presence his
[15:04] presence runs parallel to this goodness
[15:06] and mercy that we enjoy
[15:10] now the forever is not in eternity but
[15:14] it's now it's the one thing that David
[15:17] desired of the lord it's the one thing
[15:19] that he sought after Psalms 84: 1-12 if
[15:23] we could just read through this together
[15:26] how amiable are thy Tabernacles oh lord
[15:28] of hosts
[15:29] my soul longth yet even fainteth for the
[15:31] courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh
[15:34] crith out for the Living God this is
[15:37] David's uh this is an expression of one
[15:41] who desires to be in God's presence to
[15:43] know him personally to know him deeply
[15:45] not just intermittently and not just one
[15:47] day but now oh your Tabernacles and my
[15:50] soul longs to be in your courts I cry
[15:52] out for a living God yay the sparrow ha
[15:55] found a house and the swallow a nest for
[15:57] herself where she may lay her young even
[16:00] thy altars oh lord of host my king and
[16:02] my God blessed are they that dwell in
[16:05] thy house they will be still praising
[16:09] thee say la blessed are those that dwell
[16:12] there what an expression blessed is the
[16:14] man whose strength is in thee in whose
[16:17] heart are the ways of them who passing
[16:20] through the valley of bakaa a well the
[16:22] rain also filth the
[16:26] pools now
[16:29] I I I want to maybe just make a note of
[16:31] this in your hearts or if you're taking
[16:33] notes those whose strength is in the
[16:36] Lord whose heart are the ways of them
[16:38] who passing through the valley of baka
[16:40] make it a well the rain also filth the
[16:42] pools as they make their way as they're
[16:44] traveling that they they take this
[16:46] Valley something that may be desolate
[16:48] and they there the pools are what
[16:50] they've dug are filled with water these
[16:52] pools are filled with water the valley
[16:54] is made a well they go from strength to
[16:56] strength every one of them in Zion
[16:58] appear before God oh Lord God of host
[17:01] hear my prayer give ear oh god of Jacob
[17:04] say law behold oh God our shield and
[17:06] look upon the face of thine anointed for
[17:09] a day in thy courts is better than a
[17:12] thousand I had rather be a doorkeeper in
[17:15] the house of my God than to dwell in the
[17:16] tents of wickedness this is that
[17:19] hyperbole to make a point th this is his
[17:22] this is a poetic uh description of how
[17:25] that I would rather just have one day
[17:28] one day in the house of the Lord than to
[17:30] dwell a thousand elsewhere I'd rather be
[17:33] a doorkeeper in the house of my God than
[17:35] to have a special place in the tent of
[17:38] wickedness the Lord God is a son and a
[17:40] shield the Lord God will give the Lord
[17:43] will give Grace and Glory no good thing
[17:45] will he withhold from them that walk
[17:47] uprightly oh lord of hosts blessed is
[17:50] the man that trusteth in
[17:52] thee what wonderful wonderful strong
[17:56] words things that we could look at and
[17:59] really just pour through to see how this
[18:02] expression of I long to be in your
[18:04] courts my heart and my flesh cry out for
[18:06] your presence it's better to dwell just
[18:09] for one day in your presence than a
[18:11] thousand days without
[18:14] it I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the
[18:16] house of my God now it's not saying that
[18:18] we should um relegate ourselves to that
[18:21] but the expression I'd rather be a
[18:23] doorkeeper why to be in the house of the
[18:25] Lord to dwell in the house of the Lord
[18:28] was David's desire it was the psalmist
[18:31] desire so the house of the Lord forever
[18:34] it's a promise to be enjoyed now and
[18:37] always It's associated with his presence
[18:40] that is with
[18:41] us Matthew chap 28:20 Jesus telling his
[18:44] disciples before he goes away he says lo
[18:47] I Am With You Always even unto the end
[18:50] of the world he gave them the promise of
[18:53] his personal presence in John 14:16 And1
[18:56] 17 and I will pray the father and he
[18:58] shall give you another comforter that he
[19:00] may abide with you forever even the
[19:03] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[19:05] receive because it seeth him not neither
[19:07] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[19:09] dwelleth with you and shall be in
[19:12] you now the very things that David said
[19:16] that he wanted these are the very things
[19:18] that Christ is affirming that I will be
[19:21] with you forever that he will the spirit
[19:23] of truth will abide with you forever he
[19:25] will dwell with you and shall be in you
[19:29] catch how what what might have been
[19:32] something that David would say oh this
[19:33] is what I long for this is what I desire
[19:35] this is what I want to see but then he
[19:37] says I will dwell in the house of the
[19:39] Lord forever and Jesus says that I will
[19:41] send the comforter the spirit of Truth
[19:43] and he will abide with you forever and
[19:45] not just dwell dwell with you but he
[19:47] shall be in
[19:48] you and he says that that day you will
[19:51] know that I and you and me me and you
[19:53] and you and me and I and the father and
[19:55] this this Union this coming together
[19:59] I was going back over the different
[20:00] places where brother brandham recalled
[20:03] that Vision that he had where the voice
[20:05] spoke to him said Don't Fear to do
[20:06] anything or go anywhere or say anything
[20:10] for the never-failing presence of Jesus
[20:12] Christ is with you wherever you
[20:15] go we could see that as a very personal
[20:18] uh uh word to the prophet to Don't Fear
[20:21] to do anything don't fear to say
[20:23] anything don't be afraid to go anywhere
[20:25] because the never failing presence of
[20:27] Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go
[20:30] and we can draw from that that his
[20:32] presence is never failing that he will
[20:35] be with us and even in
[20:37] Us in John chapter 8:35 it says and the
[20:40] Serv servant abideth not in the house
[20:43] forever but the son abideth forever amen
[20:47] think of how that just hearkens back to
[20:49] what David is saying I want to dwell in
[20:51] the house of the Lord forever a servant
[20:54] doesn't abide in the house of the Lord
[20:56] forever a doorkeeper wouldn't
[20:59] necessarily dwell in there in the house
[21:00] of the Lord forever but he would rather
[21:03] temporarily be a
[21:04] doorkeeper than to dwell in tents of
[21:07] wickedness but Jesus says the son
[21:09] abideth if I can say in the house
[21:12] forever that's a promise to us not just
[21:15] to Christ but Jesus as a son receives an
[21:17] inheritance it's his fee simple absolute
[21:20] it is his to possess it is his to
[21:22] inhabit servant has no right to that but
[21:25] a son abideth in the house forever
[21:29] this is what David must have been
[21:31] thinking about when he said and I will
[21:32] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[21:35] because I'm not just merely a doorkeeper
[21:37] I'm not a servant I'm not a messenger
[21:38] that would come and go and I'm not one
[21:40] that would just stand outside and long
[21:42] to be there but I have some right to
[21:46] it Revelations 3:12 he that overcometh
[21:50] will I make a pillar in the temple of my
[21:52] God and he shall go no more out and I
[21:55] will write upon him the name of my God
[21:57] and the name of the city of my God which
[21:59] is New Jerusalem which cometh down out
[22:01] of Heaven from my God and I will Rite
[22:03] upon him my new name it's forever as we
[22:09] would read later in Revelation the city
[22:10] of God that comes down out of Heaven
[22:13] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[22:14] husband he says to him that overcomes I
[22:17] will make a pillar in the temple of my
[22:19] God he shall go no more out gives you a
[22:22] permanent place in this New Jerusalem a
[22:24] fixed status in the body of Christ you
[22:27] can't be taken out of it that I lo I Am
[22:30] With You Always even when you don't feel
[22:33] it we know there's the dynamic of
[22:35] grieving the Holy Spirit and it goes and
[22:37] he sets away for a little while so we
[22:39] can grieve the Holy Spirit but we cannot
[22:42] grieve him in such a way to where we
[22:44] become
[22:46] disinherited to where he would just
[22:48] banish us and and discard us to the
[22:52] side but it's
[22:54] forever we realize our life is but a
[22:57] vapor a man born of a woman is but of a
[23:00] few days and full of trouble as job said
[23:03] as it's written in job but notice this
[23:06] in 1 Peter chapter 1: 23 24 and
[23:10] 25 that we are born again not of
[23:13] corruptible seed which will die which
[23:15] will end which is temporary but of
[23:17] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[23:19] liveth and abideth
[23:22] forever we have been born again by an
[23:25] Incorruptible seed which is forever
[23:28] being born again we' have entered into a
[23:30] different relationship he says for All
[23:32] Flesh is as grass and all the glory of
[23:34] man is as the flower of grass the grass
[23:36] withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[23:39] away that is those that are born of the
[23:41] flesh born of the will of man he is born
[23:44] of corruptible seed which is as grass
[23:48] which Fades away in the flower that
[23:50] fails but it says in verse 25 the word
[23:53] of the Lord endureth
[23:55] forever and this is the word which by
[23:57] the gospel is preached unto you this
[24:00] Eternal Word preached unto you brought
[24:02] you to a place of receiving Christ and
[24:04] having been born again by the word of
[24:06] God you are now new creatures in Christ
[24:08] Jesus you are not your flesh may die it
[24:11] may get sick it may wither away but you
[24:13] have been bornn Again by Incorruptible
[24:15] seed that lives and abides
[24:18] forever how else could it be said that I
[24:21] will dwell Lo I'll be with you always
[24:23] I'll be with you even in you and that I
[24:25] will be with you forever amen not just
[24:29] calendar days not just a space of
[24:32] time but being born again by a seed that
[24:35] will never die it is
[24:40] forever I failed to mention it at the
[24:42] outset my
[24:44] the though this is maybe the wrapping up
[24:47] of a lengthy series I'm wanting to be
[24:49] very very simple and direct
[24:52] today and I i' like to just coming to
[24:56] this spot I think I'm about halfway done
[25:00] here and I want to use this verse Psalms
[25:06] 23:6 we've been looking at the house of
[25:08] the Lord forever he says I will dwell in
[25:10] the house of the Lord forever I will
[25:12] dwell in the house of the Lord
[25:14] forever he prefaces it with surely
[25:17] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[25:21] the days of my life surely when he says
[25:25] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[25:27] me all the the days of my life this is
[25:29] not a dark for boing uncertain
[25:32] future it is not I will it it is I will
[25:38] it is a shall not a well this is what I
[25:41] want he's saying I will dwell in the
[25:45] house of the Lord not one thing have I
[25:47] desired that will I seek after that I
[25:49] may dwell but now he's saying I will
[25:51] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[25:53] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[25:55] me it's not just a want he's now saying
[25:57] it with certainty
[25:59] no doubt is mixed with it there's some
[26:02] full assurance that that this is going
[26:04] to be his that this is a reality he's
[26:06] going to enjoy it's not just a mere hope
[26:08] so we can say that hope is the greatest
[26:10] enemy that faith has so there is this
[26:13] human hope so that's not rooted in the
[26:15] expectation which hope is based upon
[26:18] faith that when you have faith you can
[26:20] have a hope or an expectation to see
[26:22] that thing you believe in this is not a
[26:24] hope so this is a there's no doubt mixed
[26:27] in with
[26:28] is and he says surely goodness and mercy
[26:31] shall follow me the goodness is that W
[26:34] that which satisfies to say that the
[26:37] goodness of the Lord would follow he's
[26:39] saying that there's something that would
[26:41] satisfy our wants contribute to our
[26:43] well-being he will withhold no good
[26:45] thing from them that walk uprightly
[26:49] he'll provide he'll be one that gives
[26:51] provision this goodness contributes to
[26:55] our
[26:56] well-being surely goodness and
[26:59] mercy this Mercy encompasses many
[27:02] different expressions and manifestations
[27:03] of God's love we've spent a lot of time
[27:07] on this Mercy it's misunderstood it's
[27:10] sometimes taken for
[27:12] granted but it it it has many different
[27:15] Expressions we won't spend much time on
[27:17] that but goodness and mercy will follow
[27:21] me this word follow I one I read one
[27:25] place where it characterized it as a
[27:27] strong inferior
[27:29] word means to pursue to aim eagerly
[27:32] after to chase after to
[27:34] secure it's used of the pursuit of an
[27:37] enemy in battle that if you were to
[27:40] follow after your enemy this is that
[27:42] would be the word you say well I'm
[27:43] following my enemy not as a spy not as
[27:46] one who's lurking distantly but one
[27:47] who's eagerly pursuing after an enemy
[27:50] with which they were engaged in battle
[27:51] you're hunting him
[27:53] down and one poet said it is as if God's
[27:56] love were so eager to find the man that
[27:58] it was determined to run him
[28:00] down follow after me God's love pursuing
[28:06] we realize we didn't actually seek God
[28:09] he pursued
[28:10] us it's as if God's love was so eager to
[28:13] find us that it was determined to run us
[28:16] down to follow after to pursue with the
[28:19] fo's Zeal your enemy how he would pursue
[28:22] you and Hunt after you he'd follow you
[28:24] but it also is to pursue as the Father's
[28:26] Love For His Child
[28:28] amen a Divine
[28:31] impatience a stubborn
[28:33] Grace I think the modern language would
[28:36] be a Reckless
[28:37] Love which never faints will never fail
[28:41] or get
[28:42] weary in Psalms 30:5 it says for his
[28:45] anger endureth but a moment you notice
[28:47] that the Bible puts some barrier
[28:51] boundaries on God's anger say well his
[28:54] anger will only be for a while he said
[28:56] well how can that be well once sin is
[28:57] completely be gone and there is no
[29:00] eternal hell so once that has some
[29:02] finished up there's nothing to be angry
[29:05] about so there is a termination to God's
[29:09] anger his anger endureth but a moment in
[29:11] his favor is life in his grace in his
[29:15] favor is life and not just life uh in
[29:18] the brevity of it but eternal
[29:21] life it continues weeping may endure for
[29:24] a night but joy cometh in the morning
[29:27] his mercies are renewed every morning
[29:30] his anger may be for a moment and our
[29:32] weeping may endure for a night but in
[29:34] his grace and his favor is life and joy
[29:37] comes in the
[29:39] morning why because he goodness and
[29:42] mercy follow even if he's angry that'll
[29:46] pass even though we may weep or shed
[29:49] tears Joy comes in the
[29:51] morning the Bible says in 1st Chronicles
[29:54] 16:34 oh give thanks unto the Lord for
[29:56] he is good for his mercy endureth
[30:00] forever surely goodness and mercy shall
[30:03] follow me these are not temporal
[30:05] blessings alone and these are not things
[30:07] that come by the hand of man but God is
[30:10] good Jehovah Gyra the one who sees and
[30:13] provides for his mercy endureth
[30:17] forever his love never fails the Bible
[30:20] teaches
[30:21] us when he says surely in goodness shall
[30:23] follow
[30:25] me and I will dwell in the house of the
[30:27] Lord for ever it invokes the idea of
[30:31] completeness the the
[30:33] soundness you begin to think about how
[30:36] God brought forth creation and created
[30:38] man and placed him here on Earth
[30:40] creative love this disposition of God
[30:43] placed man on Earth and then when man
[30:46] had sinned it was now Redemptive love
[30:49] that makes a way that man could be
[30:50] redeemed you find that God God just
[30:53] continues to express himself continues
[30:55] to pursue continues to go after his love
[30:58] endures forever his love brought forth
[31:01] creation when creation fell his love
[31:02] redeems
[31:05] it in John
[31:07] 13:1 just wanting to amplify this idea
[31:10] of completeness now before the Feast of
[31:12] the Passover when Jesus knew that his
[31:14] hour was come that he should depart out
[31:15] of this world under the father having
[31:18] loved his own which were in the world he
[31:21] loved them unto the
[31:25] end it could be said that he loved him
[31:27] unto the end of his
[31:29] life but I believe it could be said
[31:31] where there's the ending of a thing it's
[31:33] better than the beginning he loved them
[31:36] to completeness he loved them unto the
[31:39] fulfilling of what he was asked to do he
[31:42] loved them not to just teach them and
[31:44] demonstrate Miracles and bring them to a
[31:46] reality that there is a God who made a
[31:48] promise to him but he loved them unto
[31:51] the
[31:52] end he loved them
[31:55] forever he loved them to the place to
[31:57] where accomplished that which they had
[31:59] need of the
[32:00] most surely goodness and mercy shall
[32:03] follow me all the days of my life we
[32:05] should look at this and he Lo he will
[32:07] love us unto the end he will look out
[32:10] after us and care for us and accomplish
[32:12] those things that are necessary for our
[32:14] well-being and for our own
[32:17] benefit Psalms 138:8 the Lord will
[32:20] perfect that which concerneth me if the
[32:23] Lord's eyes are upon the land that he
[32:24] loves to watch out after it from the
[32:26] beginning of the year to the end will he
[32:27] not also look out after you the one whom
[32:31] he loves the Lord will perfect that
[32:34] which concerneth me if God looked with
[32:36] such favor upon the house of the Lord
[32:38] whether it be a tabernacle or Temple
[32:40] that Solomon built are you not the
[32:41] building of
[32:43] God do does he not likewise look upon
[32:46] you with
[32:47] favor he will perfect that which
[32:50] concerns
[32:51] you I know I've mentioned this before
[32:55] maybe I'll try to say in a little bit
[32:56] different context but we can give a a
[32:57] lot of reverence to this building and we
[33:02] have certain things we try to
[33:04] observe uh in terms of coming to church
[33:07] early and we're quiet in the sanctuary
[33:09] and we pray and we don't like running
[33:10] around and joking and we try to be real
[33:13] we want to be very very reverent uh to
[33:15] treat this Sanctuary holy a and and have
[33:18] respect for it but do you realize that's
[33:20] just even a type of what you are to God
[33:23] that your body is a temple and the same
[33:26] type of reverence we would have for this
[33:28] this room that we're in right
[33:31] now that we would want to have that kind
[33:33] of respect toward towards another human
[33:36] being and that we would want to we would
[33:39] want to have a kind of Integrity where
[33:41] we would show respect and deference to
[33:43] one another as the family of God because
[33:46] we are his house we are his
[33:49] building and the Lord will perfect that
[33:51] which concerneth me thy mercy oh Lord
[33:54] endureth forever notice the Perfection
[33:56] is married with not just his goodness
[33:59] but his Mercy forsake not the works of
[34:01] thine own
[34:03] hands as I was reading this this past
[34:05] week it didn't necessarily strike me as
[34:08] a request but rather a statement he will
[34:11] not forsake the work of his
[34:14] hands his Mercy endures
[34:17] forever we ministered a lot on Mercy
[34:19] there was a lot that I kind of left on
[34:21] the table and didn't Express but I I
[34:23] feel impressed to share this about
[34:25] mercy God is always always
[34:29] merciful it is it is
[34:32] his it is his eternal attribute and
[34:35] characteristic so we ought not to
[34:37] conflate Mercy with the exercise of
[34:41] Mercy in other words if we feel that we
[34:44] have
[34:45] somehow
[34:47] uh if we feel that we do not experience
[34:49] Mercy or there is no mercy until we're
[34:51] miserable then we've we've kind of said
[34:54] that Mercy only
[34:55] arises and mercy only exist when
[34:58] something has happened bad or we we need
[35:01] uh we need
[35:03] mercy and it I know this may be a
[35:07] difficult proposition but if we say well
[35:09] I'm I went through something I'm going
[35:11] through something I need God's mercy and
[35:12] then God's merciful it almost begs it
[35:15] almost makes us think that well it's not
[35:18] until God showed Mercy that he had he
[35:21] was
[35:21] merciful but God is
[35:24] merciful trials and difficulties and and
[35:27] our
[35:28] do not exist in the absence of God's
[35:30] mercy yes right David is recounting in
[35:34] many of these places where he's writing
[35:36] where he's miserable he's in trouble
[35:37] he's bowed down he's anxious he's upset
[35:40] but your mercy oh Lord endures forever
[35:42] the fact that you've gone through
[35:44] something the fact that you experience
[35:45] loss the fact that you've been allowed
[35:47] to make mistakes the fact that you're
[35:48] miserable or going through it does not
[35:50] mean that God is Not merciful god is
[35:53] always merciful whether in blessing or
[35:55] Brokenness God is always merciful
[35:58] whether in gain or want God is
[36:01] merciful so we should not think that had
[36:04] I not suffered there would be no mercy
[36:06] God is always merciful and the fact that
[36:09] we suffer does not mean he is not
[36:10] merciful though he shows Mercy when we
[36:14] have suffered but we are as Paul says
[36:17] confident of this very thing Philippians
[36:20] 1:6 that he which hath begun a good work
[36:22] in you will perform it until the day of
[36:25] Jesus Christ
[36:28] he will perfect that which concerneth
[36:31] me he that has begun this work will
[36:34] perfect it perform it finish it he will
[36:35] love me unto the end because he is
[36:38] good and his mercy endureth
[36:41] forever surely goodness and mercy shall
[36:44] follow me all the days of my
[36:50] life he says and I will dwell this is
[36:54] this is the key to me I will dwell in
[36:57] the house of the Lord
[36:58] forever in his presence his goodness and
[37:02] his Mercy go before
[37:04] us
[37:07] forever as we Face the ending of this
[37:09] year the beginning of a new one I I'm
[37:11] very very deliberate to put it in this
[37:13] context I might have called it a cliche
[37:15] in the beginning but this is intentional
[37:17] we're closing out a year gives us the
[37:18] opportunity to stop take inventory think
[37:20] about what the future
[37:23] holds in the house of the Lord which I'm
[37:26] using as a phrase to speak of so many
[37:28] different things but now we've brought
[37:29] it down to this personal presence I'm a
[37:31] dwelling place I want my home to be a
[37:33] dwelling place I want this church to be
[37:34] a Dwelling Place there in his presence
[37:38] his goodness and his Mercy are
[37:41] forever they go before us in the ending
[37:44] of a thing and the beginning of a
[37:46] thing in Psalms 59:10 this is amplifying
[37:50] a little bit of his Mercy but we know in
[37:52] that most holy place there was the truth
[37:54] there was goodness there was Mercy all
[37:56] these elements come together in Christ
[37:58] who is the word in Psalms 59:10 the god
[38:01] of my Mercy shall prevent me God shall
[38:05] let me see my desire upon my enemies and
[38:07] we all like that last part favorite
[38:09] scripture Psalm
[38:11] 591b you put that on a bumper
[38:14] sticker God shall let me see my desire
[38:17] upon my
[38:19] enemies he says the god of my Mercy
[38:21] shall prevent me surely goodness and
[38:23] mercy shall follow me I I will dwell in
[38:25] the house Lord all the days of my life
[38:27] and there will be goodness and mercy
[38:30] they are the cherubs of his presence
[38:32] goodness and mercy these the the shadow
[38:35] of his wings this protective
[38:38] covering he says God the god of my Mercy
[38:40] shall prevent
[38:42] me if it seems to be somewhat of a
[38:44] clumsy language it means god the god of
[38:47] my mercy and it speaks of his Mercy
[38:49] shall go before me his Mercy will be in
[38:53] front of me he shall Lead Me beside
[38:56] Still Waters he shall lead lead me in a
[38:58] plain path because of my enemies he will
[39:00] go before and the word actually has this
[39:02] meaning of confronting because he's out
[39:04] front so he meets things as they come up
[39:08] the the god of mercy of my Mercy shall
[39:10] prevent me he will Mercy anticipates the
[39:13] need IT addresses things
[39:16] beforehand in Exodus 23:20 behold I send
[39:20] an angel before thee to keep thee in the
[39:23] way and to bring thee into the place
[39:24] which I have
[39:26] prepared he sends his Angel before them
[39:29] to keep them in the right way to make
[39:32] sure that as they follow the Angels he
[39:34] goes before them he's looking out after
[39:36] the dangers he's bringing them the right
[39:38] path to make sure that they reach the
[39:40] place that he's
[39:41] prepared it is God in his goodness and
[39:44] his Mercy that anticipates what we need
[39:47] and makes provision for it that's the
[39:50] thought behind Jehovah Gyra the God who
[39:52] sees that you need a sacrifice the god
[39:55] that sees that you need something in the
[39:56] future so he makes provision for that
[39:59] need that is going to take place you can
[40:01] even say right now for those things that
[40:04] you don't even know that you have need
[40:05] of God knows and he's already making
[40:07] provision so that in the moment where
[40:09] you find yourself lacking and you need
[40:11] it so the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[40:13] not want that I I know that his goodness
[40:16] and his Mercy will make
[40:18] provision in Psalms 231 that's what
[40:21] we're quoting the Lord is my shepherd I
[40:22] shall not want this is that comforting
[40:25] encouraging reality in God 's Providence
[40:28] that goes before us that when we come up
[40:30] to something say oh this is lacking but
[40:31] Lord you knew you knew and you will make
[40:34] a
[40:35] way in Exodus 33:14 he said my presence
[40:38] shall go with thee and I will give thee
[40:42] rest his Angel goes before you his
[40:44] presence will go with us he will bring
[40:46] us to the place that he has desired us
[40:48] to be to bring us to that expected end I
[40:51] will give thee
[40:52] rest in Deuteronomy 31:6 this promise to
[40:56] Joshua be strong and of courage fear not
[40:58] nor be afraid of them you notice how the
[41:01] language and it may seem it may just be
[41:03] more instinctive but David says when my
[41:05] Wicked and the enemies and all these
[41:06] gathered around me I will not fear I
[41:08] will not be
[41:10] afraid I will not uh be discouraged
[41:13] though I'm walking through the valley of
[41:14] the shadow of death I will not fear evil
[41:17] because I could be of good courage I can
[41:20] be strong I've been told to fear not nor
[41:22] be afraid for the Lord thy God he is it
[41:27] is that
[41:29] goeth with
[41:31] thee he will not fail thee nor forsake
[41:34] thee he it is that doth go with thee do
[41:38] not fear do not be
[41:40] discouraged do not be
[41:42] afraid because the Lord thy God is with
[41:45] you wherever you go he will not fail you
[41:48] he will not forsake
[41:52] you I'm drawing this sermon to a close
[41:54] even though I have some things here that
[41:56] I'd like to share from the message of
[41:57] the hour
[41:59] and and just even a A Hymn that I was
[42:03] just really inspiring to
[42:05] me his presence goes before us the god
[42:09] of Mercy shall prevent me he's going to
[42:10] go before me he's going to anticipate
[42:12] needs beforehand the Angel's going to be
[42:14] go before me to keep me in the
[42:16] way and by his Providence and his his
[42:19] awareness the Lord is my shepherd that
[42:21] leads me and guides me so he knows that
[42:23] we're hungry and we need to be fed so he
[42:25] he has identified a pasture to lead us
[42:26] in and defeat us he his presence goes
[42:29] before us his presence goes with
[42:32] us but the Bible
[42:36] says that goodness and mercy will follow
[42:40] us not only does his presence go before
[42:42] us but his presence also follows us
[42:45] forever you might think okay where are
[42:48] you going with this but it does say it
[42:51] follows us
[42:57] feel very impressed to put it in this
[42:59] context but some of us for some of us
[43:01] maybe all of us most of many of our most
[43:05] uh our hardest
[43:07] difficulties most difficult situations
[43:10] arise from things in our
[43:13] past and the depth that it would say
[43:15] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[43:17] me all the days of my life is so
[43:21] tremendous we could say right now well I
[43:24] I'm hoping for a better year this year
[43:26] we might all say Amen of that as bad as
[43:29] 2020 was and we kind of get that further
[43:32] on it's like man it we got nothing to
[43:34] blame it on now right life's just hard
[43:38] we don't like the way things turn out
[43:39] maybe we're not just looking back at
[43:41] this past year but we look back at our
[43:42] whole lives and there's just so much
[43:44] wreckage and turmoil and broken
[43:46] relationships and things that are
[43:47] fractured and arguments that never we
[43:49] never brought to a close or hurts or
[43:51] offences that have never been addressed
[43:52] and it just you look back and it's like
[43:54] this ticking Time bottom of our past is
[43:56] just waiting to Ambush
[44:00] us and I believe it is both the positive
[44:04] and the negatives we look unto Jesus and
[44:06] we look forward to the joy that is set
[44:07] before us and Paul says in Philippians
[44:09] 3:13 Brethren I count not myself to have
[44:11] apprehended but this one thing I do
[44:14] forgetting those things which are behind
[44:16] and reaching forth into those things
[44:17] which are
[44:18] before he's tapped into this idea that
[44:21] if I am going to reach forth there's got
[44:23] to be some letting go of what's behind
[44:25] me I I there's I remember many years ago
[44:30] some guy's kind of making a a bragging
[44:32] that he could drive from his home to his
[44:35] office
[44:36] backwards just in the rear view Mir
[44:38] drive and I the debate raging debate was
[44:41] whether or not he's going to be able to
[44:42] do it and how early in the morning he
[44:43] need to do it and and just could you
[44:46] just imagine listen I'm just going to
[44:47] make a confession for brothers if you
[44:48] want to disown me I can't back a boat
[44:50] down a boat
[44:51] ramp I've just never been able to do it
[44:54] and that's what I want to learn in 2025
[44:57] all right because you look in in the
[44:58] rear OFW do I go left do I go right what
[45:00] do I do and it's and thank thankfully
[45:02] they're getting so smart now you can say
[45:03] Hey Siri back my boat up right it's just
[45:06] going to do it for you but it's hard to
[45:08] look in the rearview mirror and get
[45:09] things
[45:10] straight and here it says so I want to
[45:13] forget those things which are
[45:14] behind so that I can appropriately aim
[45:17] for the
[45:21] Target I want to read this statement
[45:24] verbatim and not I don't want to
[45:26] paraphrase it
[45:28] uh and I should have wrote down who the
[45:30] author was he says our greatest troubles
[45:32] are ever those which belong to our
[45:34] past which come from thing the things
[45:37] that are behind us which we are striving
[45:40] to
[45:41] forget is that is there not a truth to
[45:44] this some of our greatest troubles are
[45:46] those things which belong to our past
[45:49] those things that are behind us that
[45:50] we're striving to
[45:53] forget and I I was even going to mention
[45:56] it it it during the prayer request to
[45:58] pray for me that I could have a better
[45:59] memory about certain things I they
[46:01] they're having these special services at
[46:03] South Mountain and brother Octavio
[46:05] having special services this weekend I
[46:06] wanted to go to one of the services and
[46:08] not only did I fail to go to one of the
[46:10] services because I completely forgot but
[46:11] I never even announced
[46:13] it and some might think wow that was
[46:15] really really crafty you see how he just
[46:17] navigated that whole thing never made
[46:18] the announ I just
[46:20] forgot and so there's things that you
[46:23] wish you could be better at and you want
[46:24] to you want to do better with you can't
[46:26] go go back and make certain things you
[46:28] can't go back and remember and do those
[46:29] things that you thought you should have
[46:31] done a few months
[46:32] ago but his presence not only goes
[46:35] before us but it follows
[46:39] us he follows behind us as one who
[46:42] soothes our
[46:44] troubles and can make everything well
[46:47] for it says in Romans 8:28 and we know
[46:49] that all things work together for good
[46:52] all things work together for
[46:55] good with the Indian of one year and the
[46:57] beginning of a new one we face it with I
[47:00] will set Thy word always before me
[47:03] because he is at my right hand I shall
[47:05] not be moved we think to put the word
[47:07] before us to put the proper goals before
[47:09] us wouldn't it be great if on New Year's
[47:11] Day our New Year's resolution was to to
[47:13] wake up on New Year's Day and we're
[47:15] done I'm up I wrote it I'm done it's all
[47:18] in the past what we do is we set things
[47:20] before us we look forward we anticipate
[47:23] what's going to be and so we want to do
[47:25] this that I will dwell in the house of
[47:28] the Lord forever it's something
[47:29] Visionary something forward-looking we
[47:31] spent some time on that this year and
[47:33] talking about the house of the Lord how
[47:34] there has to be uh this forward-looking
[47:36] vision and you have to be proactive and
[47:38] you got to lay the foundation well as
[47:40] you begin to build so you're looking
[47:41] forward but at this critical moment I
[47:43] want you to recognize something not only
[47:45] is it something going forward but
[47:47] remember his goodness and his Mercy are
[47:49] also following
[47:54] behind and deep than
[47:57] thinkers are probably wrestling it out
[47:59] right now that this seems to be like a
[48:01] real philosophical thing how is it it's
[48:04] following behind well he makes all
[48:05] things work together for good all things
[48:08] work together for good to them that love
[48:10] God to them that are the called
[48:11] according to his
[48:18] purpose that means no matter what know
[48:22] sometimes there's these uh moral
[48:24] victories or certain consolations that
[48:26] people have
[48:28] and and you may lose the game but you
[48:30] weren't going to let them plant their
[48:31] flag on your field things like that to
[48:33] make yourself feel better on a Monday
[48:35] morning but there will be no moral
[48:38] victories for the
[48:40] devil there will be no scoreboard well
[48:43] at least we got this or at least I hit
[48:45] for the cycle there's there's not going
[48:47] to be any moral Victory the devil's not
[48:49] going to be able to say well do you
[48:50] remember this cuz if we could just maybe
[48:53] uh dramatize it in some way he could say
[48:55] you know what you you thought you were
[48:57] you you may be going you may be making
[48:59] it but do you remember this and if we
[49:02] could God could just turn it over and
[49:03] said yeah but because of that this
[49:06] happened and no matter what the devil
[49:08] would do he just scrambling trying to
[49:09] search and figure out well there's got
[49:11] to be some place I can say scoreboard
[49:12] there's got to be some place I could say
[49:14] I got him no ain't going to
[49:19] happen CU his goodness and his Mercy
[49:21] follow
[49:24] us I'd like to use this as an example
[49:26] example in the scripture of what I mean
[49:29] by
[49:30] this I don't know if I have I think I
[49:32] have one of these uh references coming
[49:34] up so I'm just going to read a few and
[49:35] then get to Luke in Mark when Jesus is
[49:39] there in the garden and he's been
[49:40] betrayed and Judas comes and he kisses
[49:42] him and there's a he's being
[49:44] arrested Mark tells the story this way
[49:47] and one of them that stood by Drew a
[49:48] sword and smote a servant of the high
[49:50] priest and cut off his ear if this was
[49:53] the only thing that was written we know
[49:55] this is historical and we'd say in this
[49:56] moment this is all that is written one
[49:58] of them that stood by Drew a sword and
[50:00] cut off a servant of the high priest ear
[50:02] and we'd say ooh quite a aggressive act
[50:07] and then and we might not know who that
[50:08] was and how this transpired but Matthew
[50:10] when he writes about it it says and one
[50:12] of them which were with Jesus so now we
[50:14] narrowed it down stretched out his hand
[50:16] and Drew his sword and struck a servant
[50:18] of the high priest and smoted off his
[50:20] ear so we got a little bit more names to
[50:23] it and then John being who he was
[50:26] says in John 18: 101 then Simon Peter
[50:30] having a sword drew it so now we know
[50:32] who did it not only do we know that
[50:34] someone drew a sword and cut off
[50:35] someone's ear but now we know who did it
[50:38] and smote the high priest servant and
[50:40] cut off his ear and John says the
[50:42] servant's name was
[50:44] malcus he wants you to know all the
[50:46] details unless it's him the one that
[50:48] Jesus loved right just the humble
[50:50] brother John the jumble brother Han says
[50:55] he says Simon Peter having drew the
[50:57] sword smokee malus's ear and cut it
[51:00] off then said Jesus unto Peter put up
[51:03] thy sword into the sheath the cup which
[51:06] my father hath given me shall I not
[51:07] drink
[51:08] it so we know what Peter
[51:11] did we could say in his Zeal or his uh
[51:16] stubbornness or whatever his Humanity
[51:17] however you'd want to characterize this
[51:19] action this is an offense he cuts off
[51:21] someone's
[51:22] ear but this story presents us a unique
[51:26] Vantage point that I want to use to show
[51:28] you how what does it mean to dwell in
[51:30] the house of the Lord forever we can
[51:32] look at what that means in the present
[51:34] and what that might mean for the future
[51:37] but then David says surely goodness and
[51:39] mercy shall follow me we could just
[51:42] write it differently and say I will
[51:44] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[51:47] in perpetuity that now present tense as
[51:50] we've built this even to this moment
[51:53] through these several services on his
[51:54] presence right now I'm in his presence
[51:57] he dwells in me he's with me even in me
[52:00] now present tense and
[52:03] forever and so David saying surely I
[52:06] will dwell I dwell we can say I'm
[52:08] dwelling in the presence of the king
[52:12] forever and he says surely goodness and
[52:14] mercy are following behind
[52:17] me goodness and mercy following behind
[52:20] me what does that look like in Luke ch
[52:22] 22: 47-51
[52:26] his presence will go before us and
[52:29] behind
[52:30] us in Luke chapter 22: 47- 51 we see
[52:34] Peter's situation and he's been the one
[52:37] thanks to John we know it's Simon Peter
[52:38] that Drew The Sword and cut off malus's
[52:42] ear and while he yet spake Behold a
[52:45] multitude and he that was called Judas
[52:46] one of the twel went before them and
[52:48] Drew near unto Jesus to kiss
[52:50] him but Jesus said unto him Judas betray
[52:53] us thou the son of man with a kiss when
[52:55] they which were him saw what would
[52:57] follow they said unto him Lord shall we
[52:59] Smite with the
[53:01] sword and one of them Simon Peter smoke
[53:05] the servant of the high priest and cut
[53:06] off his right ear malus's ear putting
[53:10] the whole story together in Matthew and
[53:12] Mark and John we know who did it he cut
[53:15] off his ear and in those stories they
[53:17] just continue on with the arrest and the
[53:19] crucifixion of Jesus Christ but Luke
[53:21] writes something very particular
[53:24] here and it says in verse 51 not just
[53:27] put up the sword and should I not drink
[53:28] of this cup and all these other
[53:30] recitations of it say that put up the
[53:32] sword and they go forward but here Jesus
[53:34] answered said suffer ye thus far and it
[53:38] says that and he touched his ear and
[53:41] healed
[53:43] him here's a a a moment of anger and a
[53:47] moment of you know Zeal without wisdom
[53:52] and he cuts off malus's ear and Jesus
[53:55] does just doesn't say put up the sword
[53:57] and they move on but Jesus follows after
[54:00] Peter's own
[54:02] mistake and he heals this malus's ear
[54:06] and I believe he made it perfectly
[54:08] well that in doing so he said well
[54:11] you're kind of reading into that brother
[54:12] Aaron well just let me read a little bit
[54:15] that he did not just heal malcus and he
[54:16] had this real Gody Scar and malcus would
[54:19] have to live with this horrible Scar and
[54:20] he say yeah Peter did that it wasn't
[54:22] that he put the ear back on and
[54:23] cosmetically it looked fine but he lost
[54:25] his he I that malus was restored to the
[54:28] moment that he was before the sword
[54:29] struck his ear and when he healed him he
[54:32] made him complete he made him
[54:34] whole and Peter though he made that rash
[54:37] decision in that moment to actually
[54:39] fight against the will of God to bring
[54:41] this great consequence of the shedding
[54:42] of blood Jesus healed the ear that Peter
[54:45] had cut off and I believe that we can
[54:48] have confidence that his presence
[54:49] follows after us to heal even those that
[54:52] we have hurt to write the wrongs that we
[54:54] have committed
[54:57] to even reverse the consequences of our
[54:59] own Disobedience and
[55:02] stubbornness and that his
[55:04] presence can cause us to
[55:08] rest in knowing that our past cannot
[55:12] come back to Ambush
[55:14] us that we are free to go forward even
[55:16] into the new year if we want to just
[55:18] look at it in that sense we're free to
[55:19] go forward in the new year without the
[55:21] chains of the
[55:24] past when I think I think of the
[55:26] children of Israel crossing over the Red
[55:30] Sea they cross over on dry
[55:33] land and you know they're
[55:35] following they're following the pillar
[55:37] of fire they're following the cloud
[55:39] they're they're following the pillar of
[55:40] fire out they're going to cross over the
[55:42] the Red Sea opens up a and they're
[55:45] moving forward they're
[55:47] following and as they pass through they
[55:50] look back and they see their enemy
[55:51] pursuing them and what is their
[55:53] immediate thought
[55:54] well great
[55:56] we're we're we're we're going to be
[55:59] vanquished yet that's what their thought
[56:01] was when they were at the Red Sea right
[56:03] when they got there and they saw him
[56:04] pursuing like we're going to we're toast
[56:06] we made it to the Red Sea we're dead our
[56:08] pastor is going to catch up with this
[56:10] these things we thought we got over
[56:11] these things we're Victorious over
[56:13] they're going to they're eventually
[56:14] going to catch up to us here at the Red
[56:15] Sea and God does a great miracle and he
[56:17] opens up the Red Sea and they pass
[56:20] through on dry land and the open of the
[56:22] sea certainly had the effect dramatic
[56:25] effect of allowing to pass over but now
[56:27] it becomes a passageway that their very
[56:29] enemy can also cross over but God
[56:32] designed it in such a way that he would
[56:33] use that as a means of destroying this
[56:36] enemy that could have forever haunted
[56:38] them do you realize that if God had
[56:40] brought them the long way around and
[56:41] they crossed over on shallow Waters that
[56:44] the enemy could do the same thing and
[56:45] they could find themselves marching
[56:47] towards the promised land knowing that
[56:49] if their enemy takes the same route they
[56:52] can eventually find them if they would
[56:54] have just taken their time and built the
[56:55] bridge and they crossed over the bridge
[56:57] that the enemy could do the same thing
[57:00] and they would have always lived with
[57:01] this thought will Pharaoh come back to
[57:03] get us again recognizing what we did and
[57:06] have something Vendetta against us could
[57:08] they come back but God orchestrated that
[57:11] Miracle as a means of addressing the
[57:14] past and he followed behind them as they
[57:16] were going forward he dealt with their
[57:18] enemy of their past and drowned in the
[57:21] Red Sea so that they were free to go
[57:23] forward to the promised land with
[57:25] nothing but the promised in front of
[57:26] [Music]
[57:29] them that's what it means I believe this
[57:32] is part of what David meant when he said
[57:34] surely and goodness surely his goodness
[57:36] and mercy will follow
[57:39] me it's from it's the behind he's
[57:42] working
[57:43] behind making all things
[57:46] well George mat he was a Scottish
[57:49] Minister I believe he went blind around
[57:51] the age of 20 begin to go blind at 17 he
[57:54] was engaged
[57:56] to a young girl when she found out he
[57:57] was going blind he broke off the
[57:58] engagement he never married and he he
[58:02] wrote such beautiful poems and Psalms
[58:05] and believe he died in 1906 but he wrote
[58:08] this one going before
[58:10] God I want to read it as we're closing
[58:13] he said I asked my God to go before to
[58:16] light with signs the unknown Shore and
[58:19] lift the latch of every door he said I
[58:22] follow Thee I asked him to prepare my
[58:25] way by kindling each uncertain Ray and
[58:27] turning Darkness into day he said I
[58:31] follow thee he bade me linger not till
[58:34] light he touched with gold the morning
[58:35] height had touched the
[58:38] gold touched with gold the morning
[58:40] height but to begin my course by night
[58:43] and day would follow me he told me when
[58:47] my hours were dark to wait not the
[58:48] revealing spark but breast the flood and
[58:50] Duty's Ark and peace should follow me
[58:54] you know it's how we're say Lord well
[58:55] just give the light Lord just give the
[58:57] peace Lord just make a way and he says
[58:59] go I'll Follow You therefore oh Lord at
[59:05] thy command I go to seek the unknown
[59:07] land content though Barren be the sand
[59:10] if Thou shalt follow
[59:13] me I go by night I go alone I sleep upon
[59:16] a couch of stone but nightly Vision
[59:18] shall atone if without shall follow me I
[59:22] seow the seed in lowly ground I sow in
[59:25] faith and hear no sound yet in full
[59:27] months it may be found that thou Hast
[59:30] followed
[59:32] me I hope that you can look back as Long
[59:35] Fellow said to see footprints in the
[59:37] sands of time in your own personal
[59:41] life maybe you could do so in this past
[59:43] year and say that Lord
[59:47] you you told me to go we may ask that go
[59:52] before me Lord light the way show me
[59:53] what path to go but he says go don't
[59:55] wait till the morning
[59:57] breaks so don't wait until the rain has
[1:00:00] fallen go go and and and do what you
[1:00:02] know that you ought to do I will follow
[1:00:05] you though it may be dark take your
[1:00:08] first step and day will follow though it
[1:00:11] may seem difficult go forward and peace
[1:00:13] will
[1:00:15] follow no matter how Barren the sand no
[1:00:18] matter how unknown the destination he
[1:00:21] will follow you though you go by night
[1:00:24] and go alone and sleep on a couch of
[1:00:26] stone but nightly Vision shall atone God
[1:00:28] will come and follow you so I say seow
[1:00:33] the seed in the lowly ground so in faith
[1:00:35] even if you hear no sound because in
[1:00:38] full months it will be found that he has
[1:00:40] followed
[1:00:45] you brother Brandon when he preaches
[1:00:47] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:00:50] light December 29th morning service
[1:00:54] 1963 here res set December 29th in the
[1:00:59] morning just being reminded there is a
[1:01:00] man
[1:01:02] present don't get scared no matter what
[1:01:05] they
[1:01:06] say I've seen it come to the spot to
[1:01:08] where I didn't know where to move next
[1:01:11] but he is always
[1:01:14] present the never-failing presence he is
[1:01:17] always there he can turn on the light
[1:01:21] just using that phrase turn on the light
[1:01:24] turn on the light
[1:01:26] and he's not telling us to wait until
[1:01:28] the light comes on to know he's here he
[1:01:30] said no matter how dark it gets there's
[1:01:32] a man here who can turn on light and
[1:01:33] Rapture the
[1:01:35] church not that we would not we're not
[1:01:37] waiting we're not keeping still we're or
[1:01:40] just sitting uh on our hands as it were
[1:01:43] yes sir he's just waiting to see what
[1:01:45] you're going to do he can flip the
[1:01:48] switch anytime he wants yes sir there is
[1:01:51] a man here that can turn on the lights
[1:01:53] and he quotes this scripture those who
[1:01:55] set on the region of the shadow of death
[1:01:56] some of them under cancer some of them
[1:01:58] under the death of denomination some
[1:01:59] under them under Creeds death some of
[1:02:01] them under traditional death and all
[1:02:03] kinds of death and they have seen a
[1:02:05] great light the man that flash the light
[1:02:08] then is the same one who said in the
[1:02:09] beginning let there be light that same
[1:02:11] God yesterday today and
[1:02:15] forever he is present today right here
[1:02:18] now don't get
[1:02:21] scared no matter what has been and
[1:02:24] though it may be that our past seemed
[1:02:25] causes our greatest difficulties and our
[1:02:28] greatest trbl troubles ever are those
[1:02:31] which belong to our past which come from
[1:02:32] things that are behind us which you're
[1:02:34] striving to forget Lord we want to
[1:02:36] forget those things which are behind and
[1:02:38] if you're unable to forget them know
[1:02:40] that his goodness and his Mercy is
[1:02:41] following behind
[1:02:43] you he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:46] forever past present and
[1:02:49] future his Long Fellow said said on the
[1:02:54] title page of Hyperion
[1:02:56] he said ' look not mournfully into the
[1:02:59] past said well you're drawing a lot from
[1:03:02] poetry well I now this this to me just
[1:03:06] makes it a very I'm wanting to bring
[1:03:08] that one more thing out of Psalms
[1:03:10] 23 uh before I
[1:03:12] close he says look not mournfully into
[1:03:14] the past it comes not back
[1:03:17] again wisely improve the
[1:03:22] present it is
[1:03:24] thine says go forth to meet the shadowy
[1:03:27] future without fear and with a manly
[1:03:31] heart this is the very things that God
[1:03:34] was telling the children of Israel to do
[1:03:37] it's what he said to Moses it's what he
[1:03:38] said to Joshua it's what he's telling us
[1:03:40] there is a man present no matter how
[1:03:41] dark it gets don't look mournfully into
[1:03:44] the past don't be looking back with
[1:03:47] regret you can't have that back again
[1:03:50] but he says wisely improve the
[1:03:53] present it is yours
[1:03:57] so we go forth go forth to meet the
[1:03:58] shadowy future without fear and with
[1:04:01] courage that's what we want to do to
[1:04:03] that's what I'm encourage you to do how
[1:04:04] else I feel that this is just a perfect
[1:04:06] end in my heart for and I I guess it's
[1:04:08] kind of uh self- flattery there but I
[1:04:11] think it's a fitting into a series to
[1:04:13] say go forward to meet the shadowy
[1:04:15] future for you for his presence goes
[1:04:18] with you and do so this shadowy future
[1:04:21] whatever it may hold in this new year do
[1:04:23] it without fear do it with courage
[1:04:27] knowing that he's with
[1:04:28] you the past he will
[1:04:31] rectify the past he will follow his
[1:04:34] goodness and his Mercy will follow
[1:04:36] behind you and he will make a way to
[1:04:38] make these things meet and heal them and
[1:04:40] soothe them and make them
[1:04:43] well and so I say improve the present
[1:04:45] how can we do this let goodness and
[1:04:47] mercy follow you all the days of your
[1:04:51] life let goodness and mercy be that
[1:04:54] which you leave behind
[1:04:57] as he said I desire Lord or you leadth
[1:04:59] me to walk beside Still Waters you
[1:05:01] maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures
[1:05:03] anyone can desire rightfully and and not
[1:05:06] be begrudged to be cradled in Green
[1:05:08] Pastures and to lie and rest by Quiet
[1:05:13] Waters but the desire to make Green
[1:05:17] Pastures the desire to make the waters
[1:05:20] quiet that's a Divine
[1:05:24] desire that's what we read about in
[1:05:26] Psalms
[1:05:28] 84 those who go from strength to
[1:05:30] strength the man whose strength is God's
[1:05:37] strength their their strength is in
[1:05:41] God he says blessed is that man who when
[1:05:45] he passes through the valley makes it a
[1:05:48] well and the rain fills the
[1:05:51] pools it was once
[1:05:54] Barren but but because this one passed
[1:05:57] through there there's now
[1:06:00] water that not only did they dig a well
[1:06:02] but they dug pools so that when the rain
[1:06:04] would come it would
[1:06:05] collect this is what it means I believe
[1:06:09] part of this dimension of what David
[1:06:10] means surely goodness and mercy will
[1:06:12] follow me got a great future because God
[1:06:14] is with me got a horrible past because
[1:06:16] of things I've done but his goodness and
[1:06:17] mercy will take care of what has been so
[1:06:20] now what I want to do going forth to
[1:06:21] meet the shadowy future is I want to be
[1:06:23] able to look back myself and see that I
[1:06:25] left footprints in the sands of time
[1:06:28] that someone seeing those Footprints
[1:06:29] could look at them and say oh I know
[1:06:32] there's a way to take right I find
[1:06:35] myself in this dry land but someone
[1:06:37] already went before me and dug a
[1:06:40] well somebody already dug the pools so
[1:06:43] that the water could the rain could fill
[1:06:45] it up when it
[1:06:47] rains God goes before to prepare the way
[1:06:51] and this truly is a great blessing amen
[1:06:53] something we could rest in something we
[1:06:55] could be happy with but the greatest
[1:06:56] blessing is reserved for Those whom God
[1:07:00] follows whose life will prepare the way
[1:07:03] for future
[1:07:06] Generations that having bore the Briars
[1:07:09] ourselves having gone forward to meet a
[1:07:12] shadowy future we leave a light for
[1:07:15] those that follow behind us let goodness
[1:07:18] and mercy be a legacy that is left let
[1:07:21] goodness and mercy follow me for those
[1:07:23] who are following behind me whether it
[1:07:24] be my sons or and my daughter whether it
[1:07:26] be those that are friends and those that
[1:07:28] are watching Lord let it be goodness and
[1:07:30] mercy that follow Lord may I brave the
[1:07:32] briers and the thorn so that the one
[1:07:34] following behind would find that this
[1:07:36] Valley is without them because I bore
[1:07:38] them that though I may have to toil in a
[1:07:42] dry Valley that if I could dig a well if
[1:07:44] I could dig Halls so that when it rains
[1:07:47] they would feel that the next one who
[1:07:48] finds them themselves in the valley will
[1:07:50] find that there's water enough for
[1:07:52] all let this goodness and mercy follow
[1:07:56] me all the days of my
[1:07:59] life and help us
[1:08:01] Lord to trust you in the meantime amen
[1:08:07] if we could bow our heads together
[1:08:09] musicians could come to their
[1:08:10] instruments and we could stand together
[1:08:12] and pray
[1:08:32] with our heads bowed let's pray
[1:08:35] together different levels that we could
[1:08:37] pray for today Lord give me the
