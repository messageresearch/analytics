[0:00] Um, let's turn to Ephesians chapter 6.
[0:03] Very common scripture that all of us
[0:05] probably know very well. It's a it's a
[0:08] battle cry to a Christian.
[0:11] Very inspiring words from the Apostle
[0:14] Paul,
[0:16] a great man of faith.
[0:20] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10
[0:24] says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong
[0:26] in the Lord and in the power of his
[0:27] might. Put on the whole armor of God
[0:30] that you may be able to stand against
[0:32] the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not
[0:35] against flesh and blood, but against
[0:38] principalities, against powers, against
[0:41] the rulers of darkness, of the darkness
[0:43] of this world, against spiritual
[0:45] wickedness in high places.
[0:49] Remember that verse there. Wherefore
[0:52] take unto you the whole armor of God
[0:53] that you may be able to withstand
[0:56] in the evil day. and having done all to
[0:59] stand. Stand therefore having your loins
[1:02] gird about with truth and having the
[1:05] breastplate of righteousness. Having on
[1:07] the breastplate of righteousness and
[1:09] your feet shaw with the preparation of
[1:11] the gospel of peace.
[1:13] Above all, taking the shield of faith,
[1:17] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:20] all the fiery darts of the wicked.
[1:22] Amen. and take the helmet of salvation
[1:24] and the sword of the spirit, which is
[1:26] the word of God, praying always with all
[1:29] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:33] and watching there unto with all
[1:35] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:39] saints. That another translation of that
[1:42] verse 18 says this, "Pray in the spirit
[1:44] at all times and on every occasion. Stay
[1:47] alert and be persistent in your prayers
[1:50] for all believers everywhere. Let's
[1:53] let's bow our heads.
[1:55] Almighty God, we are thankful for your
[1:57] word.
[1:59] Lord, we pray that you would add the
[2:02] blessings to the reading of this word
[2:04] and and to the scriptures that I will do
[2:07] my best to bring out. Father, I pray
[2:09] that your Holy Spirit would be here with
[2:11] me and with this congregation.
[2:14] And Father, we we're grateful
[2:17] grateful that we have a Bible that we
[2:19] can open.
[2:20] We're grateful that we have a message
[2:21] that we can turn to.
[2:22] Yes, Lord.
[2:23] And most of all, we're grateful for a
[2:25] savior that gave his life for us on
[2:27] Calvary.
[2:28] Lord, we're grateful.
[2:30] Bless us, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:34] God bless you all. You can take your
[2:35] seats.
[2:38] Um, as I said, this Ephesians chapter 6,
[2:42] it's a scripture about battles, about
[2:46] wars, about these spiritual battles that
[2:49] go on in the world today. And I want to
[2:53] talk about a battle that is in the Old
[2:57] Testament
[2:59] that uh unfortunately it was a battle
[3:01] that was lost.
[3:04] And we look and we we read in in in the
[3:07] book of Joshua and we see all these
[3:09] battles that were won.
[3:12] But there was a battle before this book
[3:15] of Joshua that was a tragic loss.
[3:18] And it wasn't a loss on the battlefield,
[3:21] but it was a loss that was in the mind.
[3:24] And what had happened in the numbers in
[3:27] the 13th chapter if if you want to turn
[3:30] there. But what had happened is is the
[3:33] the Israelites, the Jews had come out of
[3:36] Egypt with a mighty hand. They had seen
[3:39] great miracles that had happened in
[3:43] Egypt.
[3:44] They had seen plagues that were brought
[3:46] down upon the Egyptians.
[3:49] There were there were there was the
[3:51] first one was the Nile River was turned
[3:53] to blood
[3:55] and then there were there frogs and
[3:57] fleas and and lice and and locusts and
[4:02] darkness.
[4:04] 10 plagues. The last one was the first
[4:07] born of Egypt was was killed.
[4:11] And these Hebrews finally it brought
[4:14] Pharaoh to his knees.
[4:16] And these Hebrews were able to walk out
[4:20] of this denomination called Egypt.
[4:24] They they were able to come out by this
[4:26] great leader, this great prophet, and
[4:28] they came out of Egypt
[4:31] and they went into the wilderness. And
[4:33] Pharaoh's heart was hardened once again.
[4:37] And he said, you know, he says, I'm not
[4:38] going to do it. He says, I'm going to go
[4:40] after them. And he sent his chariots and
[4:44] his warriors out to destroy
[4:47] the people of God. They came to the Red
[4:51] Sea.
[4:54] Their backs were up against the sea and
[4:56] on this side were the warriors.
[4:59] And God did another great miracle. Maybe
[5:02] one of the greatest miracles that has
[5:04] ever been done.
[5:06] He caused this wind to blow and and
[5:09] walled up the waters of the sea on both
[5:12] sides
[5:13] and Israel walked through on dry ground.
[5:18] They got to the other side and then God
[5:21] let the waters come down upon the
[5:22] Egyptian army and destroyed them and put
[5:25] the nail in the coffin.
[5:28] Then they started going on. They had
[5:30] seen these miracles.
[5:33] this generation that had come out even
[5:35] though they had seen the miracles. They
[5:37] started complaining. They started
[5:39] murmuring as the Bible said.
[5:41] They started fighting amongst each
[5:43] other.
[5:44] They they they had to have a a law that
[5:46] came down. They wanted to divorce their
[5:48] wives. They had had a have to had a law
[5:51] of divorcement. There was all these
[5:53] problems. They they even made a calf
[5:56] and worshiped it like the Egyptians did.
[5:59] Great failure. They came to this place
[6:02] called Kadesh Barnea.
[6:05] Numbers chapter 13.
[6:08] This was the promised land. There was
[6:12] this river Jordan. God had promised
[6:15] their ancestors starting with Abraham
[6:17] that I'm going to give you this promised
[6:19] land
[6:20] and it will be a good land.
[6:23] So Moses leads the people up to this to
[6:26] this place called Keresh Barnea and he
[6:28] sends out 12 spies.
[6:31] across this river to this promised land.
[6:35] They sent the spies out. They were out
[6:37] there for 40 days.
[6:39] They went and they saw that it was a
[6:41] good land that God had given us this
[6:43] land. It was it was a good land. It was
[6:45] a place to raise your family. It was a
[6:48] nice place. Lots of pomegranates and
[6:50] figs and grapes and and just a very
[6:53] fertile land. But the problem is there
[6:56] was giants in this land.
[6:58] There was the the Anakins, not Anakin
[7:01] Skywalker. There's no relation. These
[7:03] were the sons of Anch. And they were
[7:06] giants, very evil people, very strong
[7:10] people. They saw these people. They were
[7:12] larger than a normal man. And when they
[7:15] came back across Jordan, they gave a
[7:20] report
[7:22] saying that it's a good land,
[7:25] but we can't do it.
[7:27] because these men are too great for us.
[7:30] Even after they had seen all the
[7:31] miracles, they had seen the plagues fall
[7:33] down on Egypt, they had seen the Red Sea
[7:35] part, they had seen mana come down from
[7:37] heaven.
[7:38] And yet they did not have the
[7:40] confidence.
[7:42] And they brought this report back. But
[7:44] there was two that brought a good
[7:45] report, two of those spies, and that was
[7:47] Joshua and Caleb.
[7:49] Let's read it. Numbers chapter 13:30.
[7:54] They were all up in arms. They were
[7:56] upset. They were afraid that they
[7:58] couldn't go over. And here's what
[8:00] happened. And Caleb stilled the people
[8:04] before Moses
[8:06] and said, "Let us go up at once and
[8:08] possess it, for we are able to overcome
[8:11] it."
[8:13] But the men that went up with him said,
[8:15] "We are not able to go up against the
[8:17] people, for they are stronger than we."
[8:21] And they brought up an evil report of
[8:23] the land which they had searched unto
[8:26] the children of Israel, saying that the
[8:28] land though we though the land though
[8:32] which we have gone to search it is a
[8:34] land that eateth up the inhabitants
[8:36] thereof, and all the people that we saw
[8:39] in it are men of great stature.
[8:43] And there we saw giants, the sons of
[8:45] Anch,
[8:47] which come of the giants, and we were in
[8:50] our sight as grasshoppers.
[8:54] And so we were in their sight.
[8:59] They didn't have the confidence in God.
[9:02] They didn't have the confidence in
[9:03] themselves. So they weren't grasshoppers
[9:06] compared to these people. But they saw
[9:08] that we were in our own eyes, we
[9:10] couldn't do it.
[9:12] And then these giants saw that they
[9:15] didn't have the confidence. So they
[9:17] became grasshoppers in the sight of
[9:20] these men that were over in the promised
[9:22] land.
[9:24] And like I said, the Israelites were
[9:26] fighting among themselves. They they
[9:27] really they didn't want to go over. They
[9:29] were afraid to go to battle even though
[9:31] they had all these miracles behind them,
[9:34] you know. And I think about I think
[9:36] about brother Brandham and and all the
[9:37] things that he did, the miracles that
[9:40] had happened and and coming out of the
[9:42] denominations and and we see there they
[9:45] were with Moses and they came out with
[9:47] all these miracles and yet they
[9:50] squabbled amongst themselves
[9:52] even to the fact that they wanted to
[9:55] stone Moses and Aaron.
[9:57] They were so afraid. They had such
[9:59] little confidence in God.
[10:03] It made the Lord sick.
[10:07] It m it made him upset. He said he
[10:11] wanted to just wipe it clean
[10:13] after all that I have done for you.
[10:17] And then you start with your with your
[10:21] complaining and your murmuring and you
[10:24] don't think that you can do it.
[10:27] and uh
[10:30] they wanted the blessings of God,
[10:33] but they didn't want to go all the way.
[10:35] They maybe wanted to have one foot in
[10:37] the world, one foot in the message, and
[10:43] they didn't have the faith. They didn't
[10:45] have the lives to back it up. But God
[10:48] had promised.
[10:50] And they they see these they see these
[10:52] these great men and they said, "We are
[10:54] grasshoppers to them." They were afraid.
[10:59] And I know that this was in Isaiah
[11:02] chapter 40 verse 21. I know that this
[11:05] was written after
[11:07] that this these Hebrews came out of
[11:10] Egypt. But let me show you really
[11:12] quickly what God thinks.
[11:14] Yes.
[11:14] Of these giants and of these
[11:16] grasshoppers. It says this Isaiah verse
[11:19] 40 21. It says, "Have ye not known?
[11:23] Have ye not heard? Hath it not been told
[11:26] to you from the beginning? Have you not
[11:28] understood from the foundations of the
[11:30] earth? It is he that siteth upon the
[11:33] circle of the earth. He's talking about
[11:35] the almighty Jehovah.
[11:38] It is he that siteth upon the circle of
[11:40] the earth. And the inhabitants therein
[11:43] as he's looking down the inhabitants
[11:45] therein are as grasshoppers
[11:48] that stretcheth out the heavens as a
[11:50] curtain and spreadth them out as a tent
[11:52] to dwell. You see, we may see giants,
[11:56] but if we can get in the spirit of God,
[11:58] God sees grasshoppers.
[12:00] Let's skip down to verse 29. It says
[12:02] this, "He giveth power to the faint, and
[12:05] to them that have no might, he increasth
[12:08] strength." Amen.
[12:10] Even the youth shall faint and be weary,
[12:12] and the young men shall utterly fall.
[12:15] But they that wait upon the Lord shall
[12:17] renew their strength.
[12:19] They shall mount up with wings as
[12:21] eagles. They shall run and not be weary.
[12:23] They shall walk and not faint.
[12:27] Friends, if you trust in God,
[12:30] these grasshoppers with some of the
[12:32] sisters and and even a few of the
[12:34] brothers are so afraid of bugs, you
[12:37] know, they're they're just they're these
[12:39] terrifying
[12:40] little things that that they fly around
[12:43] and they buzz around our head. You know,
[12:45] you've seen those palvery beetles. You
[12:48] know, they look like a dinosaur.
[12:52] compared to us. And we look at it and
[12:53] we're afraid of it. You know, you're
[12:56] like a hundred,000 times bigger than
[12:59] that.
[13:00] I Googled it. Grasshoppers. The weight
[13:03] of a grasshopper is a hundth of an
[13:04] ounce.
[13:06] And a 140 pound human being is 220,000
[13:11] times bigger than a grasshopper.
[13:15] Why are we afraid of these little
[13:17] things? And that's how these demons are.
[13:19] That's how these things that come
[13:20] against us are. We have the mighty God
[13:23] that's looking down and he's seeing
[13:24] these little grasshoppers and he's able
[13:26] to just squash them.
[13:29] This is his vessel.
[13:31] When it's flying around, squash it. It's
[13:34] nothing. Squish. Don't be afraid of
[13:36] those things.
[13:38] Don't be afraid of those bugs. Don't
[13:40] Don't worry about those things because
[13:43] they are nothing.
[13:45] this experience at Kadesh Barnea. There
[13:47] was two men that had the vision. That
[13:51] was Joshua and Caleb.
[13:53] And they said, "We are more than able to
[13:55] go over and take this land." But then
[13:58] the 10
[14:00] people over there, they said, "No, we're
[14:02] we're grasshoppers. We can't do it." And
[14:04] you know, that must have stuck in
[14:05] Joshua's in Caleb's craw for a long
[14:08] time. It it bothered him. And
[14:12] we see that 40 years later, God said,
[14:17] "I'm sick of it." He said, "You were
[14:19] over there for 40 days,
[14:22] you spies." He said, "You are going to
[14:24] wander in this wilderness for one day a
[14:27] year."
[14:28] 40 years.
[14:30] Now, you are going to wander in this
[14:32] wilderness
[14:33] until every one of them except a couple
[14:37] are died out
[14:38] and they're gone.
[14:41] And time went on
[14:44] and and that generation started dying
[14:47] and passing away as as they w they
[14:50] wandered in the wilderness for this 40
[14:52] years. And then finally that generation
[14:56] was gone. The ones that complained, the
[14:58] ones that did see the miracles, the one
[14:59] that saw all these great things happen,
[15:01] the ones that came out of this this
[15:03] Egypt, yet
[15:06] they complained. They they fought with
[15:09] each other. But then there rose another
[15:11] generation.
[15:13] There arose a generation that said, "You
[15:15] know what? We believe it, brother Edgie.
[15:18] We believe this message
[15:20] and we are going to not only believe it,
[15:22] but we are going to put it into action."
[15:25] So here they are
[15:27] with their leader Joshua. Moses had just
[15:30] passed on and they came to the same
[15:33] river, this Jordan River. The river was
[15:36] swollen
[15:38] in in Joshua chapter 1. The river was
[15:41] was swollen up. It was it was
[15:44] impassible.
[15:45] But you know what? It did not matter to
[15:47] this group.
[15:49] They said, "We believe what the prophet
[15:51] said.
[15:52] We believe it and we are going to put it
[15:54] into action. Whatever it is, whatever
[15:57] the giant is, we're going to take God's
[15:59] word for it and we're going to go
[16:01] forward."
[16:02] So in Joshua chapter 1, they start
[16:06] preparing to go over.
[16:09] And in Joshua chapter 1 18, it's a
[16:11] beautiful scripture. It says this,
[16:14] Joshua is preparing the people to go
[16:16] over into this promised land, preparing
[16:18] them to go to war, preparing them to
[16:20] take their inheritance.
[16:23] And he says this
[16:28] 180 says, "The book of the law
[16:30] shall not depart out of thy mouth,
[16:34] but shalt but thou shalt meditate
[16:36] therein day and night, that thou mayest
[16:39] observe to do according to all that is
[16:42] written therein.
[16:44] For then thou shalt make thy way
[16:46] prosperous, and then thou shalt have
[16:49] good success."
[16:52] This book
[16:54] shall always be on your mind. You'll be
[16:58] reading it. You'll be thinking about it
[17:00] all the time. You can listen to the
[17:02] prophet's words all the time. It's don't
[17:05] ever let it depart from your mouth.
[17:07] Never let it never let it get away.
[17:09] Talk about it all the time. Witness
[17:11] about it all the time.
[17:13] This is part of us. This is our guide.
[17:16] Amen.
[17:18] So then in verse nine, he says this,
[17:21] "Have not I commanded thee?
[17:24] Be strong and of good courage, neither
[17:26] be afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for
[17:29] the Lord thy God is with thee wherever
[17:33] thou goest."
[17:35] This new generation tells Joshua, "As
[17:39] God was with Moses, he is with you. And
[17:43] whatever you say Joshua, we are going to
[17:45] go forward.
[17:47] So Joshua sends two spies
[17:50] over. Remember before they had 12. 10 of
[17:54] them failed.
[17:56] So he just sends two. Joshua sends two
[17:59] over. They go over Jordan. They go to
[18:02] these great walls of this place called
[18:05] Jericho. Now remember, nothing had
[18:08] changed really. These walls probably got
[18:10] bigger over this 40 years that they were
[18:12] wandering around.
[18:14] And these giants were still there.
[18:16] They were still over in the hill
[18:18] country. And and these walls were still
[18:20] fortified. These two spies go over and
[18:23] they sneak into this place called
[18:26] Jericho. The most fortified city you can
[18:28] think of. Powerful walls, you know, they
[18:32] would they would have probably rained
[18:34] down the the archers on top of them.
[18:36] Impossible to breach. And they find this
[18:40] little lady, Rahab, ble blessed young
[18:43] lady, and she says,
[18:47] "Listen,
[18:49] things are really bad here." And I think
[18:53] that these men and this warrior Joshua
[18:57] and this army probably gave her a lot of
[18:58] hope that things could change in her
[19:01] life. She hid these these messengers.
[19:04] They come back and they gave a report to
[19:07] Joshua and they said, "We are more than
[19:10] able to take it. Look at the difference
[19:13] 40 years makes. We are more than able to
[19:15] take it." And these other ones said,
[19:17] "Oh, we're afraid."
[19:19] So they go, they get ready to go over
[19:23] Jordan.
[19:24] Joshua prepares the people.
[19:28] They said, "Keep your eye on this ark.
[19:31] You haven't gone this way before. watch
[19:34] that ark. Don't lose sight of it.
[19:37] And and he tells he tells the brothers,
[19:41] he says he says the minister brothers,
[19:42] the Levites, he says he says when you
[19:44] put your feet in this Jordan River, he
[19:47] said this water is going to stop
[19:49] flowing.
[19:50] So they take the ark and they get into
[19:52] the Jordan River and the water stops
[19:55] flowing. It walls up way back upstream.
[19:59] And the Israelites, they walk over and
[20:01] Joshua says, "12 of you from each
[20:04] tribe." He says, "Stop in this this
[20:07] river." And he said, "Pick up a stone."
[20:12] And he says, "Take this thing and we're
[20:14] going to put these stones where we camp
[20:16] tonight." So they take these 12 stones
[20:20] and they put them in a heap in this
[20:22] place called Gilgal.
[20:24] And that's where they had camped. And
[20:27] Joshua says this, and I love this thing
[20:31] that Joshua said. He said, "When bring
[20:35] your children back to these stones,
[20:38] and he says, when they ask, what are
[20:40] these stones here?"
[20:43] He says, "Use that to tell them that
[20:47] this is what happened when we came over
[20:50] this Jordan on dry land." Amen.
[20:52] He says, "Use those stones, those
[20:54] testimonies to say that God parted the
[20:57] Red Sea
[20:58] and we came over in a mighty way. Tell
[21:00] your children about these things.
[21:03] Don't neglect these things. These are an
[21:05] encouragement to our young people.
[21:07] They're an encouragement to us, to our
[21:09] generation." None of us were there
[21:12] when these things happened in the 50s,
[21:14] in the 40s with brother Brandham in the
[21:16] 60s. None of us we we didn't most of us
[21:19] didn't see these great things that had
[21:21] happened.
[21:23] But these stories like those stones that
[21:26] were piled up at Gilgal, these stories
[21:28] have come down through the ages
[21:31] and they mean something to us. They're
[21:32] an encouragement to us. I was in Mexico
[21:35] City years a few years ago and we went
[21:39] to the place where brother Brandham had
[21:42] the meetings, the great Mexico City
[21:45] meetings. Remember when the when the
[21:47] little baby was raised from the dead?
[21:49] When when the uh the the Mexican girl
[21:51] came up, she was saying, "Padre, Padre,"
[21:52] and she brings her baby that died that
[21:54] morning
[21:55] and and that baby was rose from the
[21:57] dead. There was an old man that was
[21:59] showing us this place and it's a
[22:02] hospital now, but back when brother
[22:05] Brandham was here, it was a bull ring
[22:07] and he said that when they had these
[22:10] meetings, they had a big search light.
[22:12] You know, I don't know. When we were
[22:14] kids, Brother Reggie, the the um they
[22:16] used to have the search lights that
[22:18] would go up and they'd shoot way up in
[22:20] the air and what they did in Mexico City
[22:24] when you saw that search light, you'd
[22:25] follow this light and you'd come and
[22:28] there was something big going on. So
[22:31] this this man told me, he says, "So they
[22:34] had that search light. So people started
[22:36] coming
[22:38] and they started coming and hearing
[22:39] brother Brandham. He said, "I was
[22:42] there." He said, "I saw that blind man
[22:47] receive his sight."
[22:49] He said, "I was there." And he said, the
[22:51] the fame just went out throughout Mexico
[22:54] City. And he said, "Brother Brandham
[22:56] left and people were still coming to
[22:59] that place to be healed."
[23:02] And when they when they arrived, they
[23:03] got there and they said, "Well, where's
[23:06] the where's the prophet? We want we need
[23:07] to be healed." And they said, 'Well,
[23:09] he's left. He's gone.
[23:12] And many of them said, "Where did he
[23:14] stand?
[23:16] Let me just stand where he stood." Now,
[23:18] this is a brother that was there. So,
[23:21] the people came and they stood in the
[23:23] same place that the prophet stood and
[23:26] they were healed
[23:28] because of their faith. A stone that was
[23:31] laid down
[23:33] to pass down through the generations. A
[23:35] testimony. What What about these things?
[23:38] There was many of you know that my um my
[23:41] family, my grandpa Evans was close with
[23:43] brother Brandham and you know the story
[23:46] of the car that was stolen that he he
[23:50] had his car stolen. They got a ride to
[23:53] brother Brham's house and the car was
[23:55] stolen in Louisville. Many of you
[23:57] probably been to Jeffersonville.
[23:59] Louisville is on the south side of the
[24:01] Ohio River, giant river. They were in
[24:04] Louisville. They were eating. Someone
[24:05] stole their car. took off. They got a
[24:09] ride with someone to Brother Brandham's
[24:11] house. Brother Brandham got them
[24:13] together and I believe it was his den
[24:16] room. The family, my dad was there, uh
[24:19] my grandpa obviously, my aunts, my other
[24:21] uncle, they were they knelt down and
[24:24] brother Brandham prayed and he asked
[24:26] that the Lord would send an angel to
[24:29] bring this car back. Had all their
[24:31] luggage, they were traveling, had
[24:32] everything in the car. So, Brother
[24:35] Brandham, they got up and Brother Bram
[24:37] said, 'Well, let's uh let's let's give
[24:39] him time to bring it back. He says, 'You
[24:41] all take my car. And and uh and and you
[24:44] know, you enjoy with your family. He
[24:46] said, "Take my car." And um they were
[24:49] driving
[24:50] and they were driving in Jeffersonville,
[24:54] not in Louisville. The car was stolen in
[24:57] Louisville, but they were driving in
[24:59] Jeffersonville.
[25:01] and they were driving. There's a there's
[25:03] a hospital there at 10th and 10th Street
[25:05] and the freeway um Clark Memorial
[25:07] Hospital behind there a few blocks
[25:11] there's a road that goes underneath
[25:13] Highway 65. They were driving there and
[25:16] my dad looked and he said, "There's our
[25:19] car parked at the corner right out in
[25:23] the open all by itself in in just a dirt
[25:27] area." And he says, "There's our car.
[25:31] The thief, not only did he steal it and
[25:34] not take anything, but he didn't bring
[25:37] it back to the place that he stole it
[25:38] from in Louisville. They would have
[25:40] never found it. He brought it back to
[25:42] Jeffersonville.
[25:44] And they drove right by it and dad saw
[25:47] it and they got their car back. Another
[25:50] stone that is piled up that we can re
[25:54] refer back to these things. And remember
[25:57] my grandpa Wheeler, my I have uh my
[25:59] grandpa Evans on one side, my dad's
[26:01] side, my grandpa Wheeler on the other
[26:03] side. He was a deacon in Brother Bram's
[26:04] church. He um he was sick. He was
[26:08] deathly sick with um intestinal
[26:11] problems. He had what's called colitis.
[26:14] And um he had never met Brother Brandham
[26:17] before, but he heard that Brother
[26:19] Brandham was going to be my grandpa was
[26:21] from New Albany, which was right next to
[26:23] Jeffersonville. He had heard brother
[26:24] Brandham was going to be in a place
[26:25] called Actton, Kentucky.
[26:28] That's um down where uh Brother Cox
[26:31] lived and down um where the little
[26:33] sunfish was was was giving back its life
[26:37] down in that area.
[26:39] They uh they were having meetings at
[26:40] Acting Campground. My grandpa went down
[26:42] there and this is on tape and I forgot
[26:45] which tape, but you can search Wheeler
[26:47] and uh and see. said, "Brother, my
[26:49] grandpa got in the prayer line. Never
[26:51] met Brother Brandham." And again, I you
[26:54] can search it, Brother Ed Reggie. It's
[26:55] on tape. And he says, "Your name is
[26:58] Wheeler." And I think he told where he
[27:01] where he was from, told him what was
[27:03] wrong with him. And that day, my grandpa
[27:08] went went back to New Albany, Indiana
[27:12] perfectly well.
[27:14] 100%
[27:16] healed and never struggled with it
[27:18] again. Another
[27:20] testimony like is when Joshua would laid
[27:24] these stones at Gilgal, he said, "Bring
[27:26] your children back
[27:28] and tell them these stories. Tell them
[27:31] what had God has done."
[27:34] I could go on for a long time, but I
[27:38] won't. Both of my grandpas were with
[27:40] brother Brandham in Colorado when when
[27:42] the storm was spoken away. Both of them
[27:44] were there and my uncle was there too.
[27:47] Um
[27:48] it would take me all take me too long to
[27:51] go through these stories to lay all
[27:52] these these stones, these piles of
[27:54] stones down, but Joshua brought the
[27:59] people over Jordan. They conquered
[28:03] Jericho.
[28:05] They they laid these stones at Gilgal
[28:09] and then they started rolling through
[28:13] these enemies, rolling through these
[28:16] Anakins, rolling through all of the bad
[28:19] guys. Five years later,
[28:22] they get to Gilgal again
[28:26] and
[28:28] Caleb was there and he sees this
[28:32] mountain that was that was given to the
[28:34] tribe of Judah. And this mountain was
[28:38] crawling with giants. This was a
[28:41] stronghold. There was there was no way
[28:44] to conquer this place. But Caleb in his
[28:47] spirit,
[28:49] he he remembered all of these things
[28:52] that were done. He goes to Joshua at
[28:54] this place called Gilgal. Maybe he saw
[28:57] those stones piled up there
[28:59] and he remembered what God had done.
[29:03] He had hope. He knew that God was able
[29:07] to do anything.
[29:10] He knew he went over. He went through
[29:13] the Red Sea and he was leading a
[29:16] generation that they may not have gone
[29:18] but they had the same faith that Caleb
[29:21] did and they had hope. They had hope
[29:24] that God was able to do anything. There
[29:26] was a uh
[29:29] there was a study done back in the 1950s
[29:33] and uh there there's a man from Harvard
[29:35] University. His name is Dr. Kurt
[29:37] Richter. He was a uh brother Aaron's
[29:40] probably googling that right now as as
[29:42] I'm speaking. He's going to do some
[29:43] factchecking maybe, but uh he was from
[29:45] Harvard University and he did an
[29:48] experiment
[29:49] on both domestic and wild rats
[29:53] and he took I don't know what his sample
[29:56] set was, but he had he had all these
[29:58] rats and he took them and he placed each
[30:03] rat in a bucket of water
[30:06] and he wanted to see how long till these
[30:09] rats drowned. It was a it was a bit of a
[30:11] a um morbid um experiment, I guess. I
[30:16] don't know what he was trying to prove,
[30:18] but he uh and and these rats, they would
[30:20] swim around for a few minutes, up to 15
[30:25] minutes, and they drown and they'd sink.
[30:29] And he says, "Okay." So then he gets his
[30:31] next set of rats and he puts them in the
[30:34] water and they swam around for a few
[30:36] minutes up to 15 minutes. And as they
[30:39] started to sink, he grabbed them and he
[30:43] pulled them out of the water
[30:45] and he set them and let them dry, let
[30:48] them get their composure back.
[30:53] And then he took the rats and he placed
[30:56] them back in the water
[30:59] and he let them swim around. And they
[31:02] swim
[31:03] and they they they they kept swimming
[31:06] and they kept swimming. The first group
[31:09] lasted how long? Do you remember?
[31:12] 15 minutes was the most. Guess how long
[31:14] the second batch lasted?
[31:19] 60 hours.
[31:22] And he says this, here's a direct quote
[31:24] from it. He says, he said, Richtor
[31:26] recorded in his notes, after elimination
[31:29] of hopelessness, the rats do not die.
[31:34] So, what's the difference between the
[31:35] first set of rats that drowned and the
[31:37] second set of rats that didn't drown?
[31:39] They had the hope of being pulled out.
[31:42] And they remembered, and even a rat
[31:44] could remember
[31:46] that some hand was able to pull them out
[31:51] of the water and save them.
[31:54] How many people have witnessed that hand
[31:56] before in our lives?
[31:59] And he is still able today. And I can
[32:01] think of Joshua with that hope in his
[32:04] mind. He had no he seen what God had
[32:07] done
[32:08] for him. And Joshua and then Caleb comes
[32:11] to Joshua and he says, "I want that
[32:14] mountain. It was given to me."
[32:17] Give it to me.
[32:18] Joshua gives him the mountain.
[32:21] Caleb goes up and he rolls through these
[32:24] giants. He was 85 years old.
[32:29] And uh let's uh let's read it. Let's
[32:32] read that story. Joshua chapter 14 verse
[32:34] 10.
[32:36] It's worth reading. It's it's a
[32:37] tremendous story. So there here at
[32:39] Gilgal and Caleb says to Joshua, he says
[32:43] this.
[32:46] And now behold the Lord hath kept me
[32:48] alive as he said these 40 and five years
[32:52] since Kadesh Barnea. Remember he was not
[32:58] it stuck with him 45 years later. It was
[33:00] still fresh in his mind that that
[33:02] failure at Kadesh Barnea.
[33:05] Even since the Lord spake this word to
[33:07] Moses while the children of Israel
[33:09] wandered in the wilderness. And now lo,
[33:11] I am this day four score and five years
[33:13] old.
[33:16] Yet I am as strong this day as I was in
[33:19] the day that Moses sent me. As my
[33:22] strength was then, even so is my
[33:25] strength now for war, both to go out and
[33:28] to come in. He's an old man. I don't
[33:32] necessarily think that his body at 85
[33:34] years old was as good as it was at 40.
[33:37] But Josh, but Caleb did not care. He
[33:41] knew who was with him. He knew where his
[33:44] strength was. And he was as strong at 85
[33:46] years old as he had ever been.
[33:51] Now therefore, give me this mountain.
[33:54] Wherefore the Lord spake in that day,
[33:57] for thou heardest in that day, how the
[33:59] Anakims were there, and that the cities
[34:02] were great and fenced, if so be,
[34:06] the Lord will be with me. Then I shall
[34:09] be able to drive them out as the Lord
[34:11] said.
[34:13] And he did it. He conquered everyone out
[34:15] there. Remember Ephesians 6:12, for we
[34:18] wrestle not against principalities,
[34:21] you know, we are more than able to do
[34:24] this.
[34:27] And then
[34:29] 1500 years later,
[34:32] there was a man
[34:35] that faced the worst giants that have
[34:38] ever been faced.
[34:40] And friends, we face those giants. We um
[34:43] we think of Joshua and Caleb going over
[34:45] and we we think of Caleb battling these
[34:47] giants and we see the attitude that he
[34:51] had and the faith that he had.
[34:54] Let me tell you something. I believe
[34:55] this with all my heart. He had it easier
[34:57] than we have it.
[34:59] Our giants are much greater than his.
[35:03] And our giants are right here. And many
[35:06] times we invite these giants into our
[35:09] lives
[35:11] and they're more than willing to come
[35:12] in. You know, if you have if it's a
[35:15] sickness, if it's if it's some sort of a
[35:18] of a situation that you had no control
[35:20] over, that's not that's not a giant that
[35:23] you bring in. You didn't have anything
[35:24] to do with that. That's God's that's
[35:26] God's responsibility. Just put it put it
[35:29] with him and say, "Lord, I didn't bring
[35:31] this on myself. This came this is your
[35:34] battle."
[35:34] Yes. and he'll he'll take that battle.
[35:36] He'll take every battle.
[35:39] But here in this New Testament, these
[35:43] are giants often that we bring in upon
[35:45] ourselves
[35:47] and they are spirits, spiritual powers
[35:50] in these high places.
[35:53] We see Jesus in Matthew chapter 4. Jesus
[35:58] had been baptized. He had fasted for 40
[36:02] days and he goes into the wilderness to
[36:06] battle these giants. Remember Jesus was
[36:10] a man.
[36:12] One of the key phrases in the Bible is
[36:16] Jesus was God made flesh.
[36:19] Don't forget the flesh part. We all know
[36:22] the God part,
[36:23] but don't forget the flesh part. He was
[36:26] a flesh and blood man just like you and
[36:28] I are.
[36:30] He had the same
[36:33] temptations. He had the same sicknesses.
[36:35] He had all that we have. Yet unlike us,
[36:38] he never failed. He never gave in to
[36:42] these. And he was our example. So he
[36:45] goes into the wilderness weakened.
[36:48] Matthew chapter 4, I'll read it. Then
[36:52] Jesus was led up of the spirit into the
[36:54] wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
[36:57] And when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[36:59] nights, he was afterward hungered. And
[37:02] when the tempter came in, he said, "If
[37:06] thou be the son of God, command that
[37:09] these stones be made bread.
[37:13] If you're the son of God, show me how
[37:15] great you are. You know, you're so
[37:17] powerful. Let me see it. Let me see. let
[37:20] me see you do these things. If you're a
[37:22] real Christian, show me,
[37:26] you know, and we could get worked up and
[37:28] we could we could we could get worked up
[37:30] in in our own emotions and then we may
[37:32] say something maybe that's not right. We
[37:35] may get worked up and prophesy something
[37:38] that's not from God.
[37:40] And here's the devil and he's trying to
[37:43] get the son of God to do this.
[37:47] Jesus answered and said, "It is written,
[37:49] and man shall not live by bread alone,
[37:52] but by every word that proceedth out of
[37:54] the mouth of God." Then the devil taketh
[37:56] him up into the holy city, and setth him
[37:59] on a pinnacle of the temple. And he said
[38:01] unto him, If thou be the son of God,
[38:03] cast thyself down. For it is written, he
[38:06] shall give angels charge concerning thee
[38:09] and their hands, and in their hands they
[38:12] shall bear thee up, lest at any time
[38:15] thou dash thy foot against the stone.
[38:17] Maybe it's depression's working on it.
[38:19] Maybe it was anxiety.
[38:21] Maybe he was it was his self-esteem
[38:24] saying, "Am I really important?
[38:27] Am I really remember these thoughts? He
[38:30] overcame them. That's how we can touch
[38:32] Jesus because he knows how it feels.
[38:36] Or maybe he got so spiritual says, "I
[38:38] could do anything. I'll just jump off
[38:39] this this building."
[38:42] Jesus said unto him, "It is written
[38:44] again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[38:46] God." And again the devil taketh them up
[38:48] to into an exceeding high mountain, and
[38:52] showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[38:54] world, and the glory of them, and saith
[38:57] unto him, All these things will I give
[38:59] thee, if thou will fall down and worship
[39:01] me. greed.
[39:04] If you will just give in a little bit to
[39:07] the world. If you'll just lie a little
[39:10] bit, I'll give you money. I'll make your
[39:13] business successful. I'll give it to
[39:15] you.
[39:17] If you'll just conform to this world's
[39:19] way of doing things, then you can have
[39:22] everything.
[39:24] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee
[39:26] hint, Satan, for it is written, Thou
[39:29] shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
[39:31] only thou shalt serve.
[39:34] Then the devil leaveth him, and behold,
[39:36] the angels came and ministered to him.
[39:39] And Jesus, he came back out of the
[39:43] wilderness, and he started going from
[39:46] village to village, from house to house,
[39:48] and he started preaching the gospel. He
[39:50] started preaching repentance. He started
[39:53] doing miracles.
[39:55] He was building. He was building a
[39:58] ministry.
[39:59] And he was preparing. And all of this
[40:03] was coming to this first public sermon
[40:07] that he was going to have. And it's a
[40:10] famous sermon. It's called the sermon on
[40:11] the mount.
[40:13] Tremendous sermon. And and Jesus, he he
[40:17] built this ministry and he got
[40:19] everything ready. And then maybe you and
[40:21] I would have think, "Oh, well, he's he's
[40:24] going to preach on the seals
[40:26] or he's going to preach on some great
[40:28] new revelation. He's going to preach on
[40:31] something that that is going to just
[40:35] completely change everything."
[40:38] And he did preach on that, but it wasn't
[40:41] like they thought it was going to be.
[40:44] It was Matthew chapter 5. He starts with
[40:48] the biatitudes. I don't have time to go
[40:50] through it, but let's start with verse
[40:52] 20.
[40:54] Now, remember, he's talking with these
[40:56] Pharisees and Sadducees and he's talking
[40:58] with the common people. There's this
[41:00] mixed group in the audience and they
[41:03] were used to doing things a certain way
[41:05] and he was bringing something that they
[41:07] had never heard before. It's something
[41:09] that was so simple. It was simple to us,
[41:12] but they would have never thought that a
[41:14] man would say something like this. Verse
[41:16] 20,
[41:18] chapter 5, it says, "For I say unto you
[41:20] that except your righteousness ex shall
[41:22] exceed the righteousness of of the
[41:24] scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no
[41:27] case enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[41:30] These preachers lived a p pious life
[41:33] that was untouchable.
[41:35] And yet Jesus is saying, "Your
[41:39] righteousness has to exceed their
[41:41] righteousness to make it." He's starting
[41:45] to raise the bar here.
[41:49] And he says this,
[41:51] "You have said, you have heard that it
[41:54] was said of them of old time, thou shalt
[41:56] not kill. And who whoever shall kill
[41:59] shall be in the danger of judgment."
[42:00] They knew this. They were living
[42:01] according to this. But I say unto you
[42:04] that whosoever is angry with angry with
[42:06] his brother without a cause shall be in
[42:08] danger of the judgment. And whosoever
[42:11] shall say to his brother Raqqa shall be
[42:14] in danger of the council. That word raqa
[42:17] is an insult. It's like thou fool.
[42:20] You're worthless.
[42:22] Shall be in danger of the council. But
[42:24] whosoever shall say thou fool shall be
[42:27] in danger of hell fire.
[42:30] Not murdering.
[42:32] But if you just insult your brother,
[42:35] insult your sister, you just say one off
[42:40] word
[42:42] and now you're in danger of hell.
[42:44] Friends, we don't think I don't know if
[42:46] we take this word seriously enough.
[42:48] These are the words of our Lord and
[42:50] Savior Jesus Christ. And he came here
[42:52] and he said that if you just insult
[42:56] someone, you're walking the line. You're
[42:58] in danger of hell just doing that. how
[43:01] we should raise this bar in our life.
[43:05] I uh I'm going to tell on brother Aaron.
[43:09] I um Aaron's dear to me. He he's he's a
[43:13] good friend and um there was there were
[43:16] some things that were said about me a
[43:17] little while ago. It um they ended up
[43:19] nothing being true, but they had quoted
[43:21] Brother Aaron and he didn't say it. And
[43:22] it was it was kind of a it it was a
[43:25] little bit of a mess. So, I called
[43:26] brother Aaron and um I said, "Hey, you
[43:29] know, this this was said and brother
[43:31] Aaron um we got we got that squared out,
[43:35] but um I had said something that I
[43:38] shouldn't have have said. I didn't say I
[43:42] wasn't saying something that that wasn't
[43:43] true. I I wasn't spreading a rumor or
[43:46] anything like that, but I had given my
[43:48] opinion on something." And brother Aaron
[43:51] asked me, he said, "Did did you say um
[43:55] this certain thing?" I won't tell you
[43:56] what it was, but I didn't think it was a
[43:58] big deal. And uh
[44:02] I said, "Well, yeah."
[44:04] And he said, "Brother Dan," he says,
[44:06] "Uh, you need to be careful what you
[44:08] say.
[44:10] Give me good correction."
[44:13] And I'll tell you what, I needed it.
[44:18] It was something. It wasn't I'm entitled
[44:20] to my opinion, right? Well, you are. You
[44:23] know, we we have we're Americans. We're
[44:25] entitled to say what we think. We we can
[44:27] never say something wrong or lie about
[44:29] someone, but we should be able to give
[44:30] our opinion on things, right?
[44:32] No.
[44:34] No. Not if you're a Christian. There'll
[44:37] be a time that you make a stand.
[44:40] And when you make that stand, it's not
[44:42] going to be the easier thing, which is
[44:43] giving your opinion. It's going to be
[44:44] the harder thing to make that stand.
[44:47] Brother Aaron gave me some good advice,
[44:49] some good correction there and uh and I
[44:54] took it and appreciated it.
[44:58] Verse 23,
[45:02] therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the
[45:04] altar, and there rememberest that thy
[45:06] brother hath ought against thee. Now, it
[45:09] doesn't say that if someone did
[45:10] something wrong to you, if you did wrong
[45:12] to them. It just says if he has some
[45:15] sort of ought against you,
[45:20] leave there thy gift before the altar
[45:21] and go thy way and first be reconciled
[45:23] to thy brother and then come and offer
[45:26] thy gift.
[45:29] What if we would actually practice that?
[45:31] What if actually we would practice it
[45:34] that if if we heard somebody had said
[45:36] something against us or we said
[45:38] something against someone or if there
[45:39] was a perception there that we would go
[45:41] to that person and make it right.
[45:43] It's coming that time. It's going to
[45:45] have to come to that time and we're
[45:47] going to be here. We're going to die
[45:49] just like they did in the wilderness.
[45:51] But I think that it's coming. I pray
[45:53] that it is and I pray that I'm part of
[45:55] it.
[45:57] I was uh and then so often I hear the
[46:01] excuse, well, they weren't believers.
[46:03] Doesn't matter where you are. And how
[46:04] how can we tell if if this person's a
[46:06] believer or not?
[46:08] Daniel and I were in Walmart a while ago
[46:10] and and we were looking at the fishing
[46:13] stuff and and um
[46:17] Daniel I I can I don't notice anything
[46:20] but Daniel my son's observant and as I
[46:23] was looking at the fishing thing there
[46:25] was this guy that walked up. He was in
[46:27] leather with the big boots, tattoos all
[46:29] over, a big beard. He was the
[46:31] prototypical biker. Rough looking guy.
[46:35] Just as rough as you can be. and and I'm
[46:38] looking at at the the fishing gear and
[46:40] Daniel told me he walked up to me behind
[46:42] me, he looked at me and then he walked
[46:44] away
[46:46] to the end of the aisle and then he came
[46:48] back and I'm still looking at the
[46:50] fishing stuff and he says uh he tells me
[46:53] he says the pumpkin seed color are good
[46:55] for bass. He says I really like that. He
[46:58] says he says they re they really do
[47:00] well. Um the bass love them and he said
[47:04] my wife just left me. He said, "And he
[47:08] took and she took my son and I don't
[47:10] know what to do.
[47:13] I would have judged that man."
[47:17] He didn't look the part,
[47:20] but just this big old guy. And he was
[47:22] afraid.
[47:24] And I I asked him, I said, "Brother, do
[47:26] you know the Lord?" He says, "No." He
[47:27] says he says, "I need to know him." He
[47:29] says, "I've heard some stuff." He says,
[47:31] "Some Jehovah witnesses came by my
[47:32] house, but I didn't understand."
[47:35] And we had a meeting right there in
[47:37] Walmart in the fishing gear.
[47:40] But my point in saying that is we can
[47:43] never judge who is who.
[47:45] We don't know. This man I believe to be
[47:47] a son of God. And I uh I wonder I think
[47:51] one day I'll see him. And I wonder what
[47:54] our testimony meant that day but he with
[47:56] with that man.
[47:58] Verse number 25.
[48:01] Agree with thine adversary quickly,
[48:03] while thou while thoust are in the way,
[48:06] lest at any time the adversary deliver
[48:08] thee to the judge, and the judge deliver
[48:11] thee the officer, and be cast into
[48:13] prison. Verily, I say unto thee, Thou
[48:15] shalt by no means come out hence, till
[48:17] thou hast paid the uttermost faring. Ye
[48:20] have heard that it was said by them of
[48:21] old time, thou shalt not commit
[48:23] adultery. But I say unto you that
[48:25] whosoever lookth upon look on a woman to
[48:28] lust after her has committed adultery
[48:31] with her already in his heart. Now watch
[48:33] the seriousness of Jesus.
[48:36] And if thy right eye offend thee, offend
[48:39] means cause you to sin. If thy right eye
[48:42] offend thee, pluck it out and cast it
[48:44] from thee. For it is profitable for thee
[48:47] that one of thy members should perish
[48:49] and not that thy whole body should be
[48:52] cast into hell.
[48:54] What an opening sermon our Lord Jesus
[48:56] has here.
[48:59] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut
[49:01] it off and cast it from thee. For it is
[49:04] profitable for thee that one of thy
[49:06] members should perish, and not that thy
[49:08] whole body should be cast into hell.
[49:11] Jesus means business.
[49:15] These are small things that the world
[49:17] may see, but Jesus is even these small
[49:19] things can send you to hell. He's not
[49:22] saying that these these ones that cheat
[49:25] on their wives or on their husbands.
[49:27] He's saying that if you just want to
[49:31] if you just want to do it, if you just
[49:34] have that desire to do it, that you're
[49:37] in danger of hell.
[49:40] You have heard it heard that it has been
[49:42] said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for
[49:44] a tooth. But I say unto you that ye
[49:48] resist not evil. But whosoever shall
[49:51] smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to
[49:54] him the other also.
[49:57] These are the very basics of
[49:59] Christianity.
[50:01] But how much how many times do we do we
[50:04] practice this?
[50:06] Tell a story of my wife. We um
[50:11] I uh I drink I like Coke Zero
[50:16] and uh I uh I I drink half my Coke Zero,
[50:20] you know, and I didn't want to drink the
[50:21] whole thing. I didn't want to pound the
[50:22] whole thing down. So, I would just drink
[50:24] h drink half of it and I would put the
[50:27] put it back in the refrigerator to keep
[50:29] it cold, keep the fizz there. So, then
[50:32] in an hour or so, I'm going to go finish
[50:34] it. So,
[50:37] inevitably, I'd get back and I'd open
[50:39] the refrigerator and I'd get my Coke
[50:41] Zero and
[50:43] it's gone
[50:45] and she'd drink it. And it happened over
[50:49] and over and over again. And I said, "I
[50:50] got to put a stop to this." So, I took
[50:52] the Coke Zero, I drank the whole thing,
[50:54] and I poured it half full of milk
[50:59] and I put it back in the refrigerator
[51:01] and I closed it. My wife learned a
[51:04] valuable lesson that day.
[51:08] She'll never forget that. And from that
[51:11] time, I'd go and I'd open the door and
[51:15] I'd get my Coke Zero. It'd be half full.
[51:17] And I drank everything from Tabasco
[51:19] sauce to buttermilk to vinegar to salt
[51:23] water in my It didn't do any good.
[51:28] It didn't do any good to have that
[51:30] battle. And I I say it lighthearted, but
[51:33] we battle each other. And friends, even
[51:36] if we're right, and my wife is right,
[51:40] but even if we're right, don't do it.
[51:43] Don't Don't fight Don't fight these
[51:45] battles.
[51:48] Where was I?
[51:51] Um,
[51:54] verse 40.
[51:55] And if any man will sue thee at the law,
[51:58] and take away thy coat, let him have thy
[52:00] cloak also. And whosoever shall compare
[52:03] thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
[52:06] Give to him that askketh thee, and from
[52:09] him that would borrow of thee, turn not
[52:12] thou away. Thou thou ye have heard that
[52:16] it has been said, thou shalt love thy
[52:18] neighbor and hate thine enemy.
[52:21] Listen to this. They never heard
[52:22] anything like this.
[52:24] But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[52:26] bless them that curse you, do good to
[52:29] them that hate you, and pray for them
[52:31] which despitefully use you and persecute
[52:33] you, that you may be the children of
[52:35] your father which is in heaven.
[52:38] For he maketh the son, his son, to rise
[52:42] on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
[52:44] rain on the just and on the unjust. Just
[52:49] because you're blessed doesn't mean
[52:50] you're in God's will,
[52:51] right? You know, if you have a garden
[52:53] and you plant your tomatoes and your
[52:55] peppers and those things that you plant
[52:56] and the rain comes down, it waters them,
[52:58] but it also waters the weeds.
[53:00] It waters the good seed and it waters
[53:02] the bad seed.
[53:04] For if you love them which love you,
[53:07] what reward have you? Do not even the
[53:10] publicans the same? These publicans were
[53:13] bad guys. They were tax collectors. And
[53:16] I know that that uh we think that the
[53:18] tax collectors back then are bad, but
[53:20] they're worse than maybe that you
[53:21] thought. These tax collectors, they
[53:23] would they would come and they would
[53:25] collect the taxes for the people. The
[53:26] the people may have owed $1,000 on their
[53:30] taxes to Rome. So this tax collector
[53:33] would come come down and he would look
[53:35] at his ledger, $1,000. He said he would
[53:39] say, "That'll be $1,500."
[53:42] Wait a minute. Um, yeah, I only owe
[53:46] $1,000 and my tax is Yeah, it's $1,500.
[53:49] I'm not going to pay it. Okay, Brutus
[53:52] the Roman, go and take this guy's donkey
[53:56] or his ax for this extra $500.
[54:00] That's what attacks and these were Jews,
[54:02] their own people, selling their own
[54:03] people out. So, they were not good
[54:06] people. So, when you see publicans here
[54:08] now, you know that that these were hated
[54:11] people.
[54:16] And Jesus says this, "Be therefore
[54:19] perfect as your father which is in
[54:21] heaven is perfect." Can you be perfect?
[54:25] We can be perfect through Christ.
[54:28] But the Bible also says that all have
[54:31] sinned and come short of the glory of
[54:32] God. And we we so we can't but we can
[54:36] try. Matthew 5:6 it says, "Blessed are
[54:39] they that which do hunger and thirst
[54:41] after righteousness, for they shall be
[54:43] filled." When I was a 20 years ago, and
[54:47] I'm not advocating watching any kind of
[54:50] movies or anything like that, but I saw
[54:51] a movie years ago, and it was it was a
[54:55] Mel Gibson. It was called The Patriot,
[54:57] and he had his ch his his boys there.
[55:00] the the um it was a Civil War movie and
[55:04] they um
[55:06] they had killed one of his sons. So he
[55:08] had his two other sons and they were
[55:10] going to battle. They're going to ambush
[55:13] this Roman garrison, not Roman garrison,
[55:16] this uh English garrison. And he gets
[55:19] the young men there and he says, "Do you
[55:21] remember what I taught you about
[55:23] shooting?" And they said this. They
[55:25] said, "Aim small, miss small.
[55:29] And I thought when I heard that, I
[55:32] thought that's right. That's the truth.
[55:35] And that's how a Christian should be.
[55:38] When I'm when I when I shoot my bow and
[55:41] I'm shooting, I'm not shooting at the
[55:43] target. I'm shooting at a very small
[55:46] place on the target.
[55:48] And that's how we should be as
[55:49] Christians. We don't want to miss the
[55:50] whole target. We want to aim very small
[55:54] as we're going through this life. and
[55:55] and when any little thing comes up, we
[55:59] want to take care of it. Right? Man,
[56:01] Daniel and I were out. We were out uh um
[56:05] I know a lot of people don't like
[56:06] golfing and and I don't think that you
[56:08] could call what what we do golfing, but
[56:11] uh but we were out there and and um
[56:15] we're in the cart and and uh my son, he
[56:20] um it's not cheating, you know, but but
[56:23] uh he'll go in and he'll say he'll say,
[56:25] "Dad, you know, I I didn't count that
[56:27] stroke because, you know, I come some
[56:30] excuse." And I'll say, "Okay." and I'll
[56:32] I'll absolve his sins and and then we
[56:35] won't we won't put it on the scorecard
[56:37] and and and we just we keep going on to
[56:38] the next hole. Um but uh what happened
[56:42] the other day is we were out there and I
[56:44] appreciate the time with my son. You
[56:46] know, it's it's time that he and I can
[56:48] get out and and talk about things and we
[56:50] can enjoy each other's fellowship and
[56:53] and um you know, we love our children
[56:56] and we don't ever want to take it for
[56:57] granted the time that we can spend with
[56:59] them.
[57:00] So, we're in the golf cart and go out to
[57:03] hit a ball and this ball lands dunk
[57:05] right there. And uh Daniel's like, "That
[57:09] guy's, you know, he's hitting the ball
[57:10] in on us and he should know better than
[57:12] that." And uh you know, I'm gonna I'm
[57:14] gonna go if he doesn't get I'm gonna
[57:15] take his ball. I was like, "All right,
[57:19] buddy." You know, and and I said,
[57:21] "Daniel, um
[57:24] we're Christians."
[57:26] And he says, "Yeah, but he hit his ball
[57:27] over and that almost hit his dad." He
[57:29] said, "We can't let him do that." And I
[57:30] was like, "Buddy,
[57:32] we're Christians. We can't we can't live
[57:36] our lives like that.
[57:38] What good would it do if you take his
[57:41] ball?" It'd be an argument, be a fight,
[57:46] it wouldn't do any good. But if a
[57:48] Christian acts in love,
[57:50] and if a Christian is is able to to say,
[57:53] you know, it's it's okay. I'm not I'm
[57:54] going to let it go. That's how we should
[57:57] live. Whether it be on the road or
[57:58] wherever we are, we think we we're
[58:00] always thinking of this this great thing
[58:03] that's going to happen. We're always
[58:05] thinking of, well, the Lord's going to
[58:07] bring this squeeze on, then we're all
[58:08] going to get right. Friends, if he
[58:10] brings that squeeze on and you're not
[58:12] right, you're going to miss it. We need
[58:15] to get right now.
[58:17] We've heard so many different
[58:18] interpretations of the squeeze. You
[58:20] know, you've heard about it. Brother
[58:21] Brandon mentions the squeeze a couple
[58:22] times. We don't really know what it's
[58:25] going to be. I believe that we'll know
[58:27] it when it comes. But when uh when you
[58:30] have a piece of fruit
[58:33] and you squeeze it, when you have a
[58:35] lemon and you squeeze it, what comes
[58:37] out?
[58:39] Lemon juice. Right? When you have an
[58:42] orange and you squeeze it, what comes
[58:44] out? Orange juice. So friends, what's
[58:47] inside of us when we get squeezed?
[58:51] What's going to come out?
[58:53] What's going to come out is what's on
[58:55] the inside. And the inside better be
[58:58] right when that time comes. So when
[59:00] we're squeezed, love comes out.
[59:04] Servitude comes out.
[59:06] Yes, sir.
[59:08] I had I had a I have a friend, his
[59:10] name's um his name's Daniel Martinez.
[59:12] He's he's a um he's a a minister brother
[59:16] in in Mexico.
[59:18] And um he uh we went hunting and he's
[59:22] he's kind of out of shape and and uh we
[59:25] we were going to go up this mountain and
[59:26] and I said, you know, that's where we
[59:28] need to go up in glass and first thing
[59:29] he says is I can't make it. He says,
[59:31] "It's too far." I said, "Brother Daniel,
[59:34] you know, it's it's not that far. It's
[59:35] maybe a quarter mile, you know, up
[59:37] there. Half mile, not even a half mile
[59:38] up there." I said, "Well, we can just
[59:40] get up there." And he says he says,
[59:41] "No." He says, "I can't do it." And I
[59:43] said, "Well, how about if we just go up
[59:44] to this hill right here?" And he says,
[59:47] "Okay, I can make it up to there." So,
[59:48] we get up to there and we sit down and
[59:50] uh then I said, "Well, how about we go
[59:52] to this next hill?"
[59:54] He says, "Well, I can make it to there."
[59:57] And then we get to the next hill. And
[59:59] then I said, "Well, how about this one?"
[1:00:01] And pretty soon we're on the spot. And
[1:00:04] sometimes we need each other
[1:00:08] to help us through and say, "Well, we
[1:00:11] may not be able to live this Matthew
[1:00:14] chapter 5 right now, but let's take a
[1:00:16] step forward."
[1:00:17] Amen. Let's take a step forward. Let's
[1:00:19] serve each other and
[1:00:23] help each other on the way. I have uh I
[1:00:26] have a lot more scriptures here and I I
[1:00:28] don't um I'm not going to get to them
[1:00:30] all, but um
[1:00:35] Peter says this in Matthew chapter 18.
[1:00:40] He says ma chapter 18 verse1 15 he says
[1:00:43] this. He says, "Moreover," Jesus says,
[1:00:46] "If thy brother shall trespass against
[1:00:48] thee, go and tell him his faults between
[1:00:50] thee and him alone. And if he shall hear
[1:00:53] thee, thouast gain thy brother,
[1:00:56] not tell your wife, not tell your
[1:00:59] friends, not tell anyone, but if someone
[1:01:02] trespasses against us, go to that
[1:01:04] brother alone and tell him."
[1:01:08] Verse 21. Then Peter came to him and
[1:01:10] said, 'Lord, how often shall my brother
[1:01:11] sin against me? And I forgive him till
[1:01:13] seven times. Jesus said unto him, I say
[1:01:16] not to these seven times, but until 70*
[1:01:20] seven.
[1:01:22] When I I brought these scriptures in at
[1:01:25] the beginning with
[1:01:28] Joshua and with Caleb and how they
[1:01:30] fought these giants and how now these
[1:01:33] giants are presented to us every day.
[1:01:36] These giants are before us. And and like
[1:01:39] I said, the sicknesses and those things,
[1:01:43] those aren't our battle. We didn't bring
[1:01:45] those on ourselves.
[1:01:47] But these problems between each of us
[1:01:51] and and arguing and and and I see
[1:01:53] sometimes in the churches, I see, well,
[1:01:55] this person went from this church and
[1:01:57] went over to this church, so they want
[1:01:59] to blame somebody for that. What about
[1:02:02] that soul,
[1:02:03] right,
[1:02:04] that went from this church to this
[1:02:06] church? Does that person not matter?
[1:02:09] What about that soul,
[1:02:10] right?
[1:02:11] What about that person that says, "Well,
[1:02:13] I feel better here
[1:02:16] and I can worship better here." Are we
[1:02:18] not together?
[1:02:19] We should be.
[1:02:21] We should be together and worried about
[1:02:23] the souls and not about our own good.
[1:02:28] And then we will be able to cross over
[1:02:31] Jordan like Caleb did
[1:02:34] and move forward.
[1:02:37] 1 Corinthians chapter 13:10 says this.
[1:02:39] It says, "But when that which is perfect
[1:02:41] is come, then that which is in part
[1:02:43] shall be done away." When I was a child,
[1:02:46] I spake as a child. I understood as a
[1:02:48] child. I thought as a child. But when I
[1:02:51] became a man, I put away childish
[1:02:54] things.
[1:02:55] 1 Corinthians chapter 13, as you all
[1:02:57] know, he's talking about love and he's
[1:02:59] talking about how that we should raise
[1:03:02] that bar and the capstone is not maybe
[1:03:05] all the understanding that we have or
[1:03:07] all the revelation that we have, but
[1:03:11] it's love. It's loving one another and
[1:03:14] then everything will be okay. Again,
[1:03:18] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:03:20] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:03:22] shall be filled.
[1:03:24] And friends, that's what we need. We
[1:03:27] need to hunger and thirst after that
[1:03:30] that perfect, that perfection, that
[1:03:33] righteousness. Aim at a small target.
[1:03:36] Don't let these these evil things come
[1:03:39] in this fighting come in. And whether
[1:03:42] it's between brethren, between churches,
[1:03:44] or between the cashier at Walmart or the
[1:03:47] guy in the golf course, don't let it
[1:03:50] come in. Because as Jesus said in
[1:03:52] Matthew chapter 5, we put ourselves in
[1:03:54] danger of hell itself. So be very very
[1:03:58] careful. And I look at that group that
[1:04:03] saw those miracles that saw those great
[1:04:06] things
[1:04:08] in Exodus
[1:04:10] and Numbers and and and and the the the
[1:04:14] first five books of the Bible.
[1:04:17] And yet they complained.
[1:04:19] And God wiped the slate clean. But then
[1:04:24] there rose up a new generation.
[1:04:27] And that new generation loved the Lord.
[1:04:30] They love the words of the prophet. And
[1:04:33] they were not going to partake in these
[1:04:35] old things that had happened before.
[1:04:38] They were not going to do it.
[1:04:41] And friends, we can be that generation.
[1:04:45] We should be. I believe that we are.
[1:04:48] Amen.
[1:04:49] But we cannot we have to live the life.
[1:04:52] We have to say God is able and we have
[1:04:54] to move forward and not get caught up in
[1:04:56] these things of the world. The very
[1:04:58] powerful words of Jesus there in matthew
[1:05:01] chapter 5 says if you do these little
[1:05:04] things that you put yourself in danger
[1:05:06] of hell. That's how important it is. And
[1:05:10] friends, I want to be there.
[1:05:12] I want to be part of that generation.
[1:05:14] Brother Reggie, I want to see the coming
[1:05:16] of the Lord with all of my heart. I want
[1:05:18] to I want to be part of that and I
[1:05:20] believe that we will be. We need to do
[1:05:22] something. It's it's up to us if we're
[1:05:26] going to believe this message.
[1:05:29] Let's stand, brother, if you'd uh prayer
[1:05:31] to come.
[1:05:41] Let's bow our heads.
[1:05:47] Friends, as we as we think on these
[1:05:48] things, as we think on the words of our
[1:05:51] Lord Jesus,
[1:05:54] we think about these everyday
[1:05:58] trials, these everyday giants that come
[1:06:00] before us.
[1:06:05] And we think about our weaknesses. We
[1:06:07] think about how great sometimes these
[1:06:09] things are. But let's step forward.
[1:06:12] Let's move forward.
[1:06:14] And let's be as it says in this Matthew
[1:06:18] chapter 5, a light of the world.
[1:06:21] Our Lord Jesus, mighty God,
[1:06:24] we love you and we thank you Lord for
[1:06:27] for the eternal words that that we can
[1:06:30] live our lives by the guidance that we
[1:06:32] have of our Lord Jesus. And father, we
[1:06:36] thank you that that you set a standard
[1:06:40] that you brought sent a prophet in our
[1:06:42] day.
[1:06:43] And Lord, he preached a message that
[1:06:46] brought us out of these denominations.
[1:06:50] And Lord, that it has come to this day
[1:06:52] that we have had time to digest this
[1:06:54] message. And Lord, may it become real in
[1:06:57] our lives.
[1:06:59] Father, may may we step forward. May we
[1:07:01] move forward as those ones with with
[1:07:05] Joshua and Caleb, that next generation,
[1:07:07] Father. May we move forward with the
[1:07:09] word. Lord, we love you and pray that
[1:07:12] your spirit, Father, would have
[1:07:14] preeminence in our lives.
[1:07:17] Thank you, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[1:07:19] name. Amen.
[1:07:21] God bless you, my friends. And um I pray
[1:07:25] that something that I said has been a
[1:07:29] blessing to you. And remember that each
[1:07:32] of us, God is dealing with the
[1:07:34] individual. Before it was a group of
[1:07:37] people and now since the day of
[1:07:40] Pentecost, since the New Testament, God
[1:07:42] has entered into the individual. And we
[1:07:45] all have a work to do. We all have a
[1:07:47] part to play.
[1:07:49] And I pray that each one of us can find
[1:07:52] our place in God's economy.
[1:07:55] that we can be part of this great work,
[1:07:58] the finishing up of it that was started
[1:08:01] a few decades ago and now is finishing
[1:08:03] and and uh I want to be part of it. God
[1:08:06] bless you all my brother.
