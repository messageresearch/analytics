[0:00] And then here in the book of Hagi
[0:02] chapter 2 chapter verse 6 through verse
[0:05] 9 it says for thus say the Lord of hosts
[0:09] yet once it it is a little while and I
[0:12] will shake the heavens
[0:15] and I will shake the earth and the sea
[0:17] and the dry land. You see everything is
[0:19] shaking. Everything is moving.
[0:21] Everything is going to be is going it's
[0:22] is going to suffer a change. And it
[0:25] says, "And I will shake all nations and
[0:27] the desire of all nations shall come."
[0:30] And but then he said something else
[0:33] here, but he says, "And I will fill this
[0:36] house with with glory, saith the Lord of
[0:39] hosts. The silver is mine and the gold
[0:43] is mine, saith the Lord of hosts." But
[0:46] then it says, "The glory of this latter
[0:48] house,"
[0:49] right?
[0:50] Speaking now about a house. Amen. And we
[0:52] are the house of God, right? Amen. So
[0:54] now it is speaking that this house had a
[0:57] beginning, but now we're coming to the
[0:59] end o of of of the of this building and
[1:02] it is telling us here the glory of this
[1:05] latter house shall be greater than of
[1:08] the former.
[1:10] In other words, our lives will will have
[1:12] something greater than what was at the
[1:15] beginning.
[1:16] In other words, your life has to
[1:18] manifest something better than what was
[1:20] at the beginning.
[1:21] Amen. That's what I want tonight, Lord.
[1:23] I want to manifest the fruits of of your
[1:26] spirit. I I I just I not only want the
[1:28] gifts. Amen. Because the gifts and
[1:31] callings are without repentance. Amen.
[1:33] But I want to manifest the gifts the the
[1:35] the fruits of the spirit tonight. Amen.
[1:38] And then it says that be the greater
[1:41] than of the former sayeth the Lord of
[1:43] hosts. And in this place then he's
[1:46] telling us I will I give you peace
[1:50] sayaith the Lord of hosts. Amen. So he's
[1:52] going to give you peace. He his glory is
[1:55] going to be greater than the former
[1:57] glory. So um maybe we can close our
[1:59] Bibles and say thank you Lord. Now we
[2:01] can finish the service and say you have
[2:03] given me a promise that I will have
[2:05] peace in this trouble sometimes
[2:07] that I will have I I will have joy in
[2:10] the midst of my tribulation. Amen.
[2:13] All right. So, is as I said, you know, I
[2:17] normally like to have my notes here or
[2:19] my iPad. Brother Eron, he I always see
[2:21] him when he preaches, he always has his
[2:23] little piece of paper. I'm like, I was
[2:25] going to tease him tonight because I
[2:26] have to do the same because I forgot my
[2:29] iPad in Michigan.
[2:32] But anyway, it's good to have, you know,
[2:33] the paper, you know. Um, so I have
[2:37] something written here and we just want
[2:38] to follow what the Lord wants for us.
[2:40] Amen. And if if I don't say anything
[2:42] from here, but if it is coming from the
[2:44] Lord, it doesn't really matter as long
[2:46] as it comes from his throne. Amen. So,
[2:49] uh if we if we can title tonight, uh uh
[2:52] we can have a subject tonight. I I would
[2:55] like to title this I will finish my
[2:57] work. I will finish my work. Amen. It is
[3:01] not your work. Just so you know, it is
[3:04] not your Christian walk. It is the
[3:06] Lord's walk through you.
[3:08] I will finish my work. So that's my
[3:10] promise. That's what I want to speak to
[3:13] you tonight. I will finish my work. So
[3:15] before we go there, um you know, if if
[3:19] we go back a little bit in history when
[3:21] brother Brandham went to I don't
[3:22] remember exactly the city, but he was
[3:24] preaching at a city and then he um there
[3:27] was there were these two sisters that
[3:29] were friends and both of them they went
[3:31] to the prayer line. Amen. in and the
[3:33] Lord through this sermon and he told
[3:35] them what was their need and they he
[3:38] just told them you go you just go home
[3:40] rejoicing.
[3:41] Amen. So these sisters they they just
[3:43] believe in the word through the prophet
[3:45] of God. So they went home and and one of
[3:47] them I think she had an ulcer or
[3:49] something. So she wasn't able to eat
[3:51] anything because you know it will kind
[3:53] of it will kind of just come back right.
[3:55] So while she was there, but there was
[3:58] this one specific day. There was one
[4:00] specific uh time that when she was
[4:03] there, she was at the house and you know
[4:05] perhaps the kids went to when went when
[4:07] went went to school and then she started
[4:09] kind of cleaning there and then she was
[4:11] like maybe I should try something here.
[4:13] So you know the leftovers she took the
[4:15] leftovers and she kind of put some in
[4:17] her mouth and it was like hm this tastes
[4:19] good and it's like nothing is happening.
[4:22] I I can I can keep it there. And then
[4:25] she tried uh I think there was some
[4:27] toast as well and and and
[4:30] she was fine. And then she w she went
[4:31] back and just made some scrambled eggs
[4:34] and she ate them and she was fine. So
[4:35] she was well something just happened
[4:37] here.
[4:38] And then after after that you know she
[4:40] just realized that she was healed
[4:43] and then she was screaming because she
[4:45] didn't know like you know just praising
[4:47] the Lord I will say and and amen. So
[4:50] then when she was coming out of the
[4:52] house, if if I have the the the data or
[4:54] like the the information right, her
[4:57] friend was coming and I think she had a
[4:59] growth. Amen. And and when her friend uh
[5:02] was there, she was like, well, I don't
[5:03] think he's there. I don't think he's
[5:05] there anymore. And then it was like,
[5:07] well, I think you know, we were healed.
[5:10] Amen. And I just want to tell you
[5:12] something. The prophet of God says what
[5:14] happened. The angel of the Lord, Amen.
[5:17] Then Daniel prayed and it was 21 days
[5:19] before the angel could could get to him.
[5:22] Amen. How many know that? And when the
[5:24] angel of the Lord pronounced that
[5:26] blessing, what what if she had given up?
[5:29] Amen. How many times when you're giving
[5:31] a word from the Lord, you give up right
[5:33] away. But these sisters, they were like,
[5:35] if if he said it, I I will believe it.
[5:37] And that's that's that's settled. Amen.
[5:39] And then,
[5:41] you know, after if you doubt the word of
[5:43] God, then Satan will come right in.
[5:45] Amen. So, but she held right on with the
[5:48] word of God through the prophet of God.
[5:51] But what I like about this is that the
[5:54] angel of the Lord, where was the angel
[5:56] of the Lord? He was passing through the
[5:58] neighborhood that morning. Amen. He
[6:01] knows where you live. He knows all about
[6:03] you tonight. Amen. He has your address.
[6:07] He knows who you are. Amen. He knows
[6:09] where you are at. Amen. He and when he
[6:13] gives you the blessing, he will confirm
[6:15] that blessing.
[6:16] If if if God said something about your
[6:19] life, he will confir confirm that
[6:21] blessing for you tonight. Amen. This is
[6:23] not a a a question or or a guessing time
[6:26] or or a guessing game whether or not
[6:29] this is going to happen. If he said it,
[6:31] I believe it and it's settled.
[6:33] Amen. You have you have to be with that
[6:35] mentality tonight that if the Lord has
[6:37] given you promise, if the Lord has given
[6:40] you a word for your life, you just have
[6:41] to believe it. You just have to stand by
[6:43] by by with that word that the Lord has
[6:45] given because I still believe that the
[6:48] angel of the Lord is still going through
[6:50] our neighborhoods
[6:52] because what happened when sometimes you
[6:54] feel depressed when what happened when
[6:56] when sometimes you feel discouraged and
[6:58] then all of a sudden you feel something
[7:00] good there and and then that peace comes
[7:02] to your house. Who is that? Is the angel
[7:05] of the Lord is the spirit of God coming
[7:07] to your home and is confirming the word
[7:10] that he said what we just read here that
[7:12] it says in the latter in the latter
[7:14] glory will be greater and there will be
[7:16] peace.
[7:17] Yes.
[7:18] Amen.
[7:19] I be grateful tonight that there is
[7:22] peace in the midst of trouble. There is
[7:24] peace peace in the midst of the storm.
[7:27] You know, we were here on Sunday, but I
[7:29] can just say it is just the angel of the
[7:31] Lord confirming and coming and
[7:33] confirming his word for us tonight.
[7:36] Amen. How many believe that tonight?
[7:39] Amen. And then we we ask, you know, we
[7:41] we're we're talking about I I will
[7:43] finish my work, you know, and if we find
[7:46] a definition,
[7:48] what is a work? When when you ask
[7:50] yourself like what is a work? Well, in
[7:52] construction, I I am not a builder or I
[7:54] I don't work in construction, but you
[7:56] know, you do some research and maybe you
[7:58] find some definitions there. It says it
[8:02] is something that is in a process,
[8:05] a work, it is something that is in a
[8:08] process. And and then I was thinking
[8:10] about it. Well, in order for it to go
[8:12] through a process, you have to have a
[8:14] blueprint.
[8:16] Amen. And and then you have to have a a
[8:18] goal that that uh uh construction is
[8:21] going to be finished at a specific time.
[8:23] Amen. You can like you know like the
[8:26] Bible it says when when uh the king is
[8:29] going to war he has to count the cost.
[8:31] Amen. And when you're going to build a
[8:33] house you have to count the cost and you
[8:35] have to make sure that you have the
[8:36] budget to be able to to build that
[8:38] house.
[8:39] Amen. That's the same thing with with
[8:40] with the Lord. You know he has the
[8:42] blueprint. He had already counted the
[8:45] cost and he had already said that he
[8:47] already saw my end from the beginning.
[8:51] Aren't you grateful tonight that he
[8:53] already saw who you're going to be at
[8:55] the end of your days? That you already
[8:57] redeemed. That you already raptured.
[8:59] Yes.
[9:00] Amen.
[9:02] But what happens? It requires materials.
[9:05] It It requires the hand of a good mason
[9:08] to be able to put the materials where
[9:10] they are needed. You require a good
[9:13] shepherd that is going to be coming and
[9:14] it's going to bring some correction
[9:16] there or some encouragement, but it's
[9:18] because that house needs to keep
[9:19] building and building and building.
[9:21] Amen. So, don't get mad with the
[9:23] minister when he tells you that you're
[9:24] going wrong.
[9:26] It's just correcting there. You know,
[9:27] it's like is putting together, you know,
[9:29] the the the the is putting you in in the
[9:32] right place, in the right position so
[9:34] that you can go straight.
[9:36] Because if we wouldn't have someone that
[9:38] will tell us that we're doing wrong, I
[9:40] don't know how my house will be built.
[9:41] Yeah. Very good.
[9:43] But I'm grateful that we have the
[9:44] message of the hour. I'm grateful that
[9:46] we have this Bible that we can go back
[9:48] to the scriptures and it can tell me my
[9:51] my my true identity tonight.
[9:53] Amen.
[9:56] And you know many times as human beings
[9:58] we we look at our lives and and we
[10:01] measure ourselves
[10:03] with the with the word of God and many
[10:06] times we are you know like that king
[10:07] that they he was found lacking. Amen. He
[10:10] he was found short but and many times we
[10:14] we are not meeting the measure that the
[10:17] Lord is asking from us.
[10:19] Amen. This brings frustration. This
[10:22] brings disappointments. We get
[10:24] discouraged. Amen. And um we also tend
[10:28] to compare ourselves with other
[10:29] Christians. Oh, you know that sister is
[10:32] is is is she looks so Christian, you
[10:35] know, like her dress and everything
[10:36] looks so good, but just ask her how
[10:38] she's doing. She may be going through
[10:39] something and you're trying to compare
[10:41] yourself with with her.
[10:43] That's that's not a good thing. You
[10:45] know, in in a late president, American
[10:47] president, he said the comparison is the
[10:50] thief of joy.
[10:53] When you as a Christian
[10:56] start comparing yourself with somebody
[10:58] else
[10:59] that is not the word of God,
[11:01] then it is going to steal your joy.
[11:04] Amen.
[11:05] So my advice tonight is compare yourself
[11:09] with the word of God.
[11:11] There you know why? Because the word of
[11:13] God is the one that brings joy. The word
[11:16] of God is the one that brings peace.
[11:18] Amen. the the word of God is is the one
[11:21] that provides all the materials that I
[11:24] need to keep building the Lord's house.
[11:27] Amen.
[11:28] But I want to tell you something that
[11:30] the Lord has already made provisions so
[11:32] we can make it.
[11:34] Amen. The Lord because you know many
[11:36] many people think that the Lord is
[11:38] guessing every day on how my life is
[11:41] going to go through,
[11:44] right? Many people think that God God
[11:46] works that way, but that's not the way
[11:47] it works, you know, because he you know
[11:50] what the Bible says Romans 8:28 that he
[11:52] already saw before the foundation of the
[11:54] world and he already had seen a finished
[11:57] work.
[11:58] Amen. So if if he is if he's asking me
[12:02] for something is because he had already
[12:04] provided what I need
[12:07] to to fulfill that something that he's
[12:09] asking me. Amen. He's asking me to to to
[12:12] be uh to walk in holiness. Then he's
[12:15] going to put that desire in my heart
[12:17] even.
[12:18] Yes.
[12:19] You won't be able to do anything without
[12:21] the Lord putting that in your heart.
[12:25] Amen. He already made provisions. This
[12:27] is not a guessing time. This is a
[12:30] resting time.
[12:32] It's hard to say it. You know, it's
[12:34] hard. I put it here. Put it here. It's
[12:35] hard to say it than do it. Amen. I can
[12:38] tell you tonight, you have to rest. You
[12:39] have to rest. But then you can tell me,
[12:40] "Oh, but you don't know what I'm going
[12:42] through." But I'm still going to tell
[12:43] you, you have to rest.
[12:45] Amen.
[12:45] Amen. The goal here, you know, well, the
[12:48] the reason why here or why we're here is
[12:51] not to take us out of the grace of God
[12:53] or bring us to the law and then we
[12:55] compare ourselves to the law and then
[12:57] you're going to be falling short. No,
[12:59] no, no. That's not the goal. The goal is
[13:01] to bring us to the center where you need
[13:03] the law and you need grace.
[13:05] Amen.
[13:06] Amen. because it won't work if if you if
[13:08] you work with one of them because the
[13:10] prophet of God says that they have made
[13:12] this a disgrace
[13:14] and we don't want that. But if he said
[13:17] that we rest in we have to rest in what
[13:20] he had already promised that is going to
[13:22] come to pass.
[13:23] That's what we have to rest on. And if
[13:25] he had said that he is the Lord that
[13:27] health all my diseases, all my
[13:29] sicknesses,
[13:30] I have to settle in that. I have to rest
[13:33] in that.
[13:34] Amen.
[13:35] He will do it. He had already paid for
[13:37] it. And if he asks you for something, as
[13:40] I said, it's because he already provided
[13:43] that. He already he had already provided
[13:45] that. Then the prophet of God says,
[13:47] "This great creator, he's the savior.
[13:50] God is faithfully working amongst his
[13:54] own right now as the great shepherd of
[13:57] the sheep."
[13:58] Amen.
[13:59] His very existence is for his own. He
[14:02] loves them and cares for them.
[14:06] His eyes is ever upon them. When the
[14:09] word says that your lives are hid with
[14:11] Christ in God, it means exactly what it
[14:15] says.
[14:15] Amen.
[14:16] Oh, I'm so glad that my God abides
[14:19] abides faithful. He's true to himself.
[14:22] He won't lie. He's true to the word. He
[14:25] will back it up. He's true to us. He
[14:28] will lose none of us, but raise us up.
[14:31] raise us up in the last day. And I can
[14:34] tell you I am glad that I am resting in
[14:38] his faithfulness.
[14:40] It is not brother Boas's faithfulness
[14:42] here because I can fail you tonight. But
[14:45] I'm resting in God's faithfulness. And
[14:47] that's what is going to carry you
[14:49] through through your situation, through
[14:51] your circumstances tonight. And that
[14:53] rest that you can rest in his
[14:55] faithfulness because the Bible says even
[14:58] when you are unfaithful,
[15:01] he remains faithful. Amen. We can rest
[15:05] on that and say thank you Lord because I
[15:08] I have I I make many mistakes or I I say
[15:11] many things that I shouldn't have but
[15:13] you still remain faithful to me Lord.
[15:18] Amen.
[15:21] Amen.
[15:22] So at work, you know, I and I've seen a
[15:25] brother said it this way. He's like in
[15:28] heaven or, you know, it's like there was
[15:30] already a family picture taken.
[15:32] Yep.
[15:33] Amen. And I was there.
[15:36] Yes. Right.
[15:37] You know, I was there, you know,
[15:38] standing there and I was there. I don't
[15:40] know if you were there, but I was
[15:41] already there and I was smiling there.
[15:43] So that's a picture that the Lord had
[15:46] already taken. And the Lord is not
[15:48] looking at the one that is right here.
[15:50] He's looking at the one that he had
[15:52] already seen before before the
[15:54] foundation of the world. Amen. You know,
[15:57] and I can tell, you know,
[16:00] Lord, this is your promise and I believe
[16:02] it tonight. If you seen me before the
[16:04] foundation of the world, I'm settled
[16:06] with that tonight. And Amen. If we can
[16:08] say like here we are in the negative,
[16:11] but he is the positive. He's already
[16:13] seen the positive in us. Amen. So I want
[16:16] to change your mindset tonight and and
[16:18] and instead of you seeing your negatives
[16:21] and start seeing what the Lord is doing
[16:23] through you.
[16:24] And and that's the positive thing.
[16:26] That's a positive thinking. You know,
[16:27] brother Anna says positive thinking will
[16:29] bring will bring positive results.
[16:32] Amen.
[16:32] Amen.
[16:33] Hallelujah.
[16:34] You know we if we think about it is like
[16:37] an apple tree. You can take a seed, you
[16:39] know, think take think think about it.
[16:40] And I think somebody said like when you
[16:43] look at at an apple tree seed, it has
[16:46] the potentials to to provide I think up
[16:48] to 12,000 apples
[16:50] in that little seed.
[16:53] 12,000 apples
[16:55] and and you know and and you see it like
[16:57] it's nothing. So if you see your life
[16:59] sometimes it's like what am I producing?
[17:01] What am I doing? Well, it's not what you
[17:03] see. is what the Lord is seeing through
[17:05] your life. Because maybe you are at home
[17:07] and you're witnessing to someone not to
[17:10] not by what you say but by the life that
[17:13] you're living that other people is like
[17:15] I want to be like them. I I want to I
[17:17] want to I I want to I want to walk like
[17:20] them. They they are different. And what
[17:22] is that? You're producing something.
[17:24] Amen.
[17:26] It's like you can see that potentially
[17:28] the in in that seed there there is that
[17:30] fruit. Amen. And that is the same with
[17:32] the Christian. And if he saw you before
[17:34] the foundation of the world, he saw your
[17:36] faults.
[17:38] He saw your shortcomings.
[17:40] But he is seeing the potentials that are
[17:42] within you and how you are his child.
[17:46] Amen.
[17:47] You you were not you won't be. You are
[17:50] his child.
[17:52] He is what the Lord is saying. He's
[17:54] seeing you through the blood of Christ.
[17:55] And the only thing he sees he's he only
[17:57] see the blood of Christ covering this
[18:00] world and and he doesn't see your
[18:02] mistakes. Why? because he's seeing you
[18:03] through the blood.
[18:04] Amen.
[18:06] Many people is seeking, if we can say
[18:08] this, many people is seeking for the
[18:10] gifts of the spirit which they are
[18:11] great. The gifts of the spirit are
[18:13] great. And we want to be measured by the
[18:17] gifts that you that that I have.
[18:20] Amen. But I want something more.
[18:23] I don't want only the gifts.
[18:25] I want to be measured. I want to measure
[18:28] my experience by the fruits of the
[18:31] spirit of God. Amen.
[18:32] Amen. Because why or what's the reason
[18:35] that I'm going to be producing those
[18:36] fruits is because the fruit giver is
[18:39] living within me.
[18:40] But the gifts as the Bible says gifts
[18:42] and calling are without repentance.
[18:45] And any anyone can can can have the
[18:47] gifts but the fruits not and the devil
[18:50] cannot have love.
[18:52] The the the enemy can cannot love their
[18:55] the his or the his brother or sister,
[18:58] right? But when you have the love of
[19:00] Christ, when Christ is living in you,
[19:02] then you have the giver of the fruits.
[19:06] And then the fruits that I'm going to be
[19:07] producing, then then I can measure
[19:09] myself by the love that I can share with
[19:11] others, by the joy, by the peace that I
[19:13] can share with others.
[19:14] Amen.
[19:16] The again, nothing against the gifts,
[19:19] right?
[19:19] We we need to bring that to the center
[19:21] because many people say, "No, you don't
[19:22] you you don't have to have the gifts."
[19:24] No, you you can have the gifts,
[19:25] but I'd rather the the fruits because
[19:27] the gifts, they they they can they can
[19:29] fade away, but the the fruit of God, the
[19:32] fruit of the spirit, they it will always
[19:33] be there. You know, Galatians 5:22 verse
[19:36] uh verse 20 5:22 it says, "But the fruit
[19:39] of the spirit is love, joy, peace,
[19:45] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[19:48] faith, meekness, temperance,
[19:52] and you start looking at all of these,
[19:53] it's like, Lord, how many of them am I
[19:55] producing tonight?"
[19:57] And then it it says against such there
[20:00] is no law and they are that are Christ
[20:04] and they that are Christ have crucified
[20:08] the flesh with the fle with the
[20:10] affections and lust. But if we live in
[20:13] the spirit, let us also walk
[20:16] in the spirit. Amen. Let us not let us
[20:19] not be these areas of vain glory
[20:21] provoking one another, envying one
[20:24] another. Right?
[20:25] But what do I have to do? And always
[20:27] remember that I remember when I was in
[20:29] Sunday school, there was this sister
[20:31] that was teaching Sunday school and I
[20:32] remember she put a a tree there and then
[20:35] she she taught us this verse and now I
[20:38] always remember but the fruits of the
[20:39] spirit there joy, peace, longsuffering
[20:42] in in all of them. You know, I don't
[20:43] know them in English, but I remember
[20:45] them in Spanish. I still remember
[20:47] something. Amen.
[20:49] But this is importance and that's what
[20:51] we're saying like it is good to have the
[20:54] gifts again. Yes.
[20:55] But is better to have the fruits
[20:58] because against the fruits against the
[21:00] fruits of the spirit there is no law
[21:02] against them
[21:03] there is nothing that can destroy the
[21:05] fruits of the spirit because they come
[21:06] from God.
[21:08] Amen.
[21:09] Now we if you just think a little bit
[21:12] about um I was thinking about Jacob and
[21:16] uh if you read in the scriptures you
[21:18] know when when Esau was on his way to
[21:20] kill Jacob he he was desperate. He enter
[21:24] into that desperation because it's like
[21:26] if if I don't receive a a body change,
[21:29] if I don't receive a mindset change, if
[21:32] I don't receive a nature change,
[21:35] then I'm going to die.
[21:37] Why? Because you know I it says here in
[21:40] in the book of Genesis chapter 32 24 it
[21:45] says, "And Jacob was left alone, and
[21:48] there wrestle a man with him until the
[21:50] breaking of the day. And when he saw
[21:52] that he prevailed not against him, he to
[21:54] the hollow of his thigh and the hollow
[21:57] of Jacob's thigh was out of joint and he
[21:59] wrestled with him. So is the first time
[22:02] that a man is is wrestling with God.
[22:05] Amen. And he said let me go for the day
[22:08] breakth and he said I will I will not
[22:11] let thee go
[22:13] and except thou bless me. And he said
[22:15] unto him what what what is thy name? And
[22:18] he said Jacob. He's like,
[22:22] "Jacob, that's your name." I don't He
[22:25] said, "Thy name shall be called no more
[22:26] Jacob, but Israel, but for as as a
[22:30] prince has thou power with God and with
[22:33] men, and hast prevailed." And Jacob
[22:36] asked him and said, "Tell me, I pray
[22:37] thee thy name." And he said, "Wherefore
[22:39] it is thou that does ask after my name?"
[22:41] And he blessed him there. You know, so
[22:44] there was a situation here. So we have
[22:46] Jacob. He's he's fighting with the angel
[22:48] and then there there there is a name
[22:51] change. There is a a something happened
[22:55] here and and then after the angel left,
[23:00] I can tell you when you have an
[23:02] encounter with the Lord, he changes your
[23:04] name
[23:06] and he changes the way the way you walk
[23:09] because after Jacob ended of the end of
[23:13] the fight, then he was there limping.
[23:15] Why? because he he had touched him, you
[23:17] know, the the the he had had that that
[23:19] fight there. But when God comes, he ch
[23:22] he changed Jacob's name. Amen. He he he
[23:26] now changed him from Jacob to uh uh
[23:29] prince with God.
[23:31] And and when God comes to you, he
[23:33] changes the way you walk.
[23:36] He changes your life. He changes your
[23:38] your desire. But who who does that
[23:41] again? And this is the emphasis of
[23:43] tonight. I will finish my work. It
[23:46] wasn't Jacob's work. It wasn't Jacob's
[23:49] doing. It was the Lord's doing in
[23:52] Jacob's life. And And why is is a name
[23:55] change important? Why is it important?
[23:58] Brother Brandham says, you said, what
[24:00] difference? What what difference does
[24:02] the name mean? Why? Sure, it means
[24:05] something. Your name characterizes your
[24:08] life.
[24:09] Amen. Why was it when Jacob he lived to
[24:12] his name as a deceiver, a suppler, it
[24:15] was Jacob. Amen. And when God changed
[24:18] him, he changed his name. God changed
[24:21] the name of Jacob, he changed as as he
[24:24] changed the name of Saul to Paul, from
[24:26] Simon to Peter, certainly the name has
[24:29] something. And when you think about
[24:30] characterization or characterizes your
[24:32] life, it means it it is speaking about
[24:35] your character. And it also speaking
[24:37] about special qualities that you have in
[24:39] your life.
[24:40] That's what you need. An a a name
[24:42] change. That's what you need a a a
[24:45] nature change.
[24:47] Amen. And and
[24:50] that's my my my my desire tonight. I I
[24:54] not only want to have a name change, but
[24:56] I also want to have a a a different walk
[24:58] with the Lord. Amen. Because that is
[25:00] what happened with Jacob. His his name
[25:02] was changed. His nature was changed. And
[25:05] now what's your name now? I'm I am no
[25:07] longer Jacob. I am now Israel. I am now
[25:11] a prince with God.
[25:12] Yes.
[25:13] And and then the Lord now we bring it to
[25:15] our day. He has made us princes. And he
[25:17] has made he has made us even more than
[25:19] that. He has made us kings and priests.
[25:22] Now he has given us a new name. And what
[25:24] is that name that the the the families
[25:27] on earth are named? The name of our Lord
[25:29] Jesus Christ. That is your new name. And
[25:32] then when you have that new name in your
[25:34] life that brings a new nature in your
[25:37] life that now again is not your work.
[25:41] It's not how much you can come to church
[25:43] but it is the Lord doing the work.
[25:47] I'm so grateful for that. That is Lord
[25:49] thank you that it is not my work because
[25:52] if it is we if it will be for my own
[25:54] effort I wouldn't be here.
[25:56] If it if it wouldn't be by grace just
[25:58] think about it. I was just thinking,
[26:00] Lord, if it if it wouldn't be by for
[26:02] your by your grace, I wouldn't be here.
[26:04] I don't know where I will be.
[26:06] But I'm just grateful that you have
[26:08] changed my name. You have changed my
[26:10] nature that now I don't have a nature of
[26:13] a vulture or or or or a or a deceiver or
[26:17] of a liar or a suppler. I have the
[26:19] nature of a son of God.
[26:22] Amen.
[26:23] That's my nature. You ask me my name.
[26:25] You ask me why I'm happy. I can tell you
[26:28] why. I know. Because my sins have been
[26:30] forgiven. And now I can enjoy the
[26:33] blessings of the heavenly father.
[26:36] Amen. May my talk show that I have had
[26:40] an experience with you, Lord. Like
[26:42] Jacob, he wasn't scared to fight
[26:45] anymore. He wasn't scared to believe.
[26:48] Amen.
[26:48] Amen. How many here sometimes are afraid
[26:50] to believe? And the prophet of God says
[26:52] that's a trouble with this me with with
[26:54] men tonight. That's the trouble with
[26:56] people tonight. You are scared.
[26:59] That is the biggest curse there is on
[27:01] the full gospel people or any other
[27:03] people is because they are afraid.
[27:07] God has made the provision. Again, the
[27:09] Lord has made the provision but you are
[27:12] afraid to take his word for it.
[27:15] If you weren't afraid tonight, why would
[27:17] you take that? Why? Sorry. Why? You will
[27:21] take your healing by faith and know that
[27:23] God promised your healing. If you're
[27:25] sick tonight, you can say, "I'm healed
[27:27] because the Lord is my healer."
[27:30] And and and if you are depressed
[27:32] tonight, you can say, "Lord, you are the
[27:33] giver of joy."
[27:35] And the thing will just go plum away
[27:37] from you, afraid, scared. He says, "And
[27:40] I've noticed it." And that is the reason
[27:42] I am such a believer in healing. I know
[27:45] that if you can get away from that scare
[27:48] and get love, that's the key. Get love
[27:51] because love
[27:54] keeps away fear. Cast away fear
[27:57] and you get that the love of Christ in
[27:59] your life. Then I'm not afraid anymore.
[28:01] Lord, whatever may happen. I've said
[28:03] that before and I had some,
[28:06] you know, some some situations at home.
[28:08] My mom got sick one time. I was
[28:09] preaching. I was like, "Oh Lord, I'm not
[28:11] going to say that again."
[28:13] You know you can say whatever has
[28:14] happened Lord is I'm open but yeah you
[28:16] got to be careful what you say you got
[28:18] to mean it from your heart.
[28:19] Yeah right.
[28:20] Amen. But we believe in the love of God
[28:23] in its place something is going to
[28:26] happen. Amen. There there is only two
[28:28] faculties that govern a human and one of
[28:31] them is faith
[28:33] which brings results and the other is
[28:35] fear. Amen. Which has no value. Think
[28:39] about it. fear it doesn't have value
[28:42] because it is it doesn't exist
[28:44] right
[28:45] but what about faith it does exist even
[28:47] though I cannot see it but I I I know
[28:50] that it exists because fear is is like
[28:53] is is something that I am you know think
[28:55] about people that when they are anxious
[28:57] about things it's like being afraid of
[29:00] the future being afraid of tomorrow when
[29:02] tomorrow hasn't even happened
[29:05] or being depressed thinking about the
[29:07] past
[29:08] when the past is already gone.
[29:11] And missing the present with Christ.
[29:14] Amen. The love of God in your heart.
[29:17] Amen. Faith is of God.
[29:20] Fear is of the devil.
[29:23] Fear makes you weary. Fear makes you
[29:26] wonder.
[29:27] But what happened with Jacob? He was not
[29:29] wondering. He was not afraid. After he
[29:32] had that experience with Christ, he was
[29:34] not the same. after Saul when when when
[29:37] he became Paul, he didn't have he he
[29:39] wasn't a perse a persecutor of the
[29:42] church anymore. Now he was part of them.
[29:45] Why? Because his his mindset was ch was
[29:48] changed. His his his uh his way of
[29:51] living, his walk was changed and now he
[29:54] wanted to be part of the Christians.
[29:56] Same thing with Peter. You know what?
[29:57] Tell me about Peter. Before he had an
[29:59] experience in the in the upper room,
[30:01] yeah,
[30:01] he denied the Lord. Amen. But what
[30:04] happened after the Holy Ghost the Holy
[30:06] Ghost came to his life? It was a
[30:08] complete change.
[30:10] But now what can you tell me about the
[30:12] church? When the church or when the when
[30:14] the child or or daughter of God had had
[30:16] an experience with Christ, they cannot
[30:18] walk the same way.
[30:20] I can tell you that you cannot walk the
[30:23] same way when you have had an experience
[30:25] with Christ because there is now
[30:27] something burning in your life that now
[30:29] you want to please him more and more and
[30:32] more. And why is that? Because now he's
[30:34] living in you.
[30:36] That is that that is the key here is
[30:39] because now he is living in me and I
[30:41] he's doing the work and I am resting.
[30:44] Isn't that beautiful? He's doing the
[30:46] work and I am resting.
[30:49] I'm resting in the work that he had
[30:52] already done before the foundation of
[30:53] the world. Amen.
[30:56] Let me see. I don't know what time it
[30:59] is, but praise the Lord.
[31:00] Amen.
[31:01] Okay, it's 8:10. Okay, I am in Michigan
[31:03] time, so that's like 10 for me. So, I'm
[31:06] already late.
[31:12] Amen. So, now let let's think about this
[31:14] a little bit. And you know, we're
[31:15] talking about the Lord. I will finish
[31:16] the work. I will finish the work. I will
[31:19] finish the work. You know when you think
[31:22] about Serubbabel
[31:23] and and and if you think about the
[31:25] meaning of Serubbabel is the one that
[31:28] was planted in Babylon
[31:31] because Serubbabel was born in Babylon.
[31:33] Amen.
[31:33] And then he went with the captives. He
[31:35] went back to to to Jerusalem to reveal
[31:38] to start the the the rebuilding of the
[31:40] temple. Amen.
[31:42] So if we read there in Zechariah chapter
[31:44] 4 f vers verse 4 it says so I answered
[31:51] and spake to the angel and talk with me
[31:55] saying
[32:01] what are these my lord then the angel
[32:05] that talked with me answer and said unto
[32:07] me knowest not thou what this be? And I
[32:13] said, "No, my lord." Then he answered
[32:16] and spake unto me, saying, "This is the
[32:19] word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,
[32:22] saying, not by might, not by power, but
[32:26] by my spirit, said the Lord of hosts."
[32:31] And then, who art thou, oh great
[32:33] mountain, before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt
[32:35] become a plain and he shall bring forth
[32:38] the headstone thereof with shoutings
[32:41] crying grace grace
[32:46] unto it. Moreover, the word of the Lord
[32:49] came unto me, saying, the hands of
[32:51] Serbel have laid the foundation of this
[32:53] house. And that's the promise. The hands
[32:56] of Serbel have laid the foundation of
[32:59] this house, and his hands also will
[33:02] finish the house. If he started the
[33:05] work, he is faithful to complete it
[33:08] until the day of the Lord. Amen. And
[33:10] thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts
[33:12] has sent me unto you. For who hath
[33:15] despised the day of the small things,
[33:18] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[33:20] plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.
[33:22] Remember what is the plummet? Is the one
[33:24] that brings the center.
[33:26] Amen. We need a Servabel to bring the
[33:29] center of the scriptures so that we stay
[33:31] in the in the center. We cannot go you
[33:33] cannot go to the right or to the left
[33:35] because you know when you think about a
[33:37] river on the sides is where the trash is
[33:39] going
[33:40] and I don't want to be there.
[33:41] I don't want to be there where where
[33:43] where the word of God has been
[33:44] compromised or something. I don't want
[33:46] to be there. I want to be in the center
[33:48] where where I can shout and I can be at
[33:50] peace
[33:51] when I can have an experience with
[33:53] Christ and and I can I can cry and I
[33:56] also can can can can jump. But I am not
[33:59] measuring my my experience by the
[34:02] external actions but I am measuring my
[34:05] experience what by what is happening
[34:07] within me.
[34:09] Amen.
[34:09] Amen. That's what we need to measure.
[34:11] Amen.
[34:12] And then when it is saying here the day
[34:14] of a small things think about like you
[34:16] know we kind of the despised and the
[34:18] rejected. This is your day. This is your
[34:20] hour. The day of a small things you are
[34:23] despised rejected but this is the day
[34:25] that the Lord had made. For they shall
[34:27] rejoice again. They shall rejoice and
[34:30] shall see the plummet in the hand of
[34:31] Zerubbabel with those seven that they
[34:33] are the eyes of the Lord which run to
[34:36] and fro through the whole earth. What is
[34:38] he talking about here is talking about
[34:39] the seven spirits sent to the church.
[34:41] You know the seven candlesticks. It is
[34:43] speaking about it. But what I wanted to
[34:45] to to emphasize here in this scripture
[34:48] it says this is the word of the Lord
[34:50] unto Zerubbabel saying not by might.
[34:53] It's not by how strong you are. It's not
[34:55] by how much you know,
[34:57] right?
[34:58] It's not your again, it's not your work.
[35:00] Yes.
[35:01] If you can just rest in that tonight,
[35:03] that is not your word, your work. If the
[35:06] Lord started this house, the Lord is the
[35:08] one that is going to finish the
[35:10] building.
[35:11] Amen.
[35:13] It's not by power, but by my spirit,
[35:16] said the Lord of hosts. Amen. Now, and
[35:19] the prophet of God says, and we know
[35:20] that the scripture says that Jesus is
[35:22] the chief cornerstone. And he's also the
[35:26] headstone. Amen. And and and then it is
[35:29] saying here the seventh church messenger
[35:31] was to restore the faith of of the
[35:33] children back to the fathers. Amen. In
[35:36] other words, reveal the church again
[35:39] under the power of the spirit.
[35:41] Amen.
[35:42] Not not not of the letter the letter
[35:44] because the letter kaleth but the spirit
[35:47] giveth life. So that's when the the the
[35:50] the church of the that's the reason why
[35:52] the church of God needed to be rebuilt
[35:56] by the spirit.
[35:57] Amen.
[35:58] Because the spirit is the one that
[35:59] brings life.
[36:01] Amen.
[36:03] Not by power, not by might, but by my
[36:06] spirit, says the Lord. Not by
[36:08] organization or by denomination, but by
[36:11] the Holy Spirit. God will bring forth
[36:13] the church in the last days.
[36:16] Amen. in uh Seruabel the prince with
[36:19] Joshua was the one that was to bring
[36:22] forth this headstone.
[36:24] Amen. So in if in that time there was a
[36:27] a natural type, there is a spiritual
[36:29] type that had to come in our days. Amen.
[36:33] He laid the foundation. He took the
[36:35] people back to the foundation in type.
[36:38] Amen. That was the the function or or
[36:40] that was the the work of Zerubbabel to
[36:42] bring back the people from the captivity
[36:44] to bring them back to Jerusalem to start
[36:46] rebuilding the temple.
[36:47] Amen.
[36:48] That was his job.
[36:50] But the the word of the Lord came to
[36:52] Zerabel. But it's not by by your by your
[36:54] strength Zabel
[36:56] is by my spirit.
[36:58] Which we all know that these are and is
[37:00] talking brother Brandham is talking
[37:02] about the candlesticks and all of that.
[37:04] And then and the headstone was never put
[37:07] in the pyramid.
[37:08] Amen. So if you look at the head the the
[37:11] the pyramid, it it didn't have a
[37:13] headstone. Why? Because they rejected
[37:15] the headstone.
[37:18] Amen. So that but then one of the things
[37:21] that was happening when they were
[37:22] building those the pyramid is that those
[37:25] stones were were very heavy and and but
[37:29] but when they put them together he says
[37:31] that even a thin razor blade could not
[37:33] get into it. Amen. But and and they are
[37:36] not he's like bre is saying that they
[37:38] are not even cemented like they didn't
[37:39] have to use anything. They just put them
[37:41] all together and they just all fit
[37:42] together in the body of in in in that
[37:44] pyramid. And amen. So, and then he says
[37:47] that's the way the body of Christ should
[37:49] be.
[37:50] Yes.
[37:51] Amen.
[37:52] That when you come to church, you have
[37:54] to fit together.
[37:56] Amen.
[37:57] Amen.
[38:00] You have to be caught by the Holy Spirit
[38:02] by God's great instruments and tools and
[38:05] and we had we would be joined as one
[38:08] person. Amen. All the spirit in unity.
[38:10] All the all the people in unity. And
[38:12] then he says we are not divided.
[38:14] Right. Amen. It becomes so political.
[38:17] You know, we are not divided. If we're
[38:19] here, we are one body, one mind, one
[38:21] accord. Amen. We should be one person.
[38:24] And it goes to show that no machinery
[38:26] can do that that way.
[38:28] Right?
[38:29] The church cannot be united by by a
[38:31] human by by by a human being.
[38:35] Right?
[38:35] That won't happen.
[38:37] Because at the at the at the first uh
[38:39] you know little disagreement then people
[38:42] leave. Yeah.
[38:44] But it is not by power. Sorry. It's not
[38:47] it's not by by might, not by power, but
[38:50] by his spirit that the church is getting
[38:52] united.
[38:54] Amen. And it go and it takes God. It the
[38:57] prophet of God says and it takes God to
[39:00] do that. It takes God to bring the unity
[39:03] in the church. You know it to me like on
[39:06] Sunday when I was here and I was hearing
[39:08] everybody singing you could you could
[39:10] feel that unity and I was Lord may this
[39:12] unity keep growing and growing more in
[39:15] the love of Christ you know it's
[39:17] sometimes it's funny you know you you go
[39:19] to a church and and it's good you know
[39:21] you sing songs and everything but
[39:23] sometimes it is specific occasions that
[39:26] I go to a church and even if they are
[39:29] singing the fastest song I am crying
[39:33] why because you can feel the presence of
[39:34] God and then you can see the people
[39:37] entering into that spirit of God and and
[39:39] I could experience that on Sunday.
[39:41] Wonderful. Praise the Lord.
[39:42] Amen. So I just want to encourage you
[39:44] tonight. Keep that spirit going
[39:47] and and again it's not by might is not
[39:49] by your strength but just keep yielding
[39:52] resting in the promise of the Lord in
[39:54] what? In the work of the Lord.
[39:57] Amen. The prophet of God says it takes
[39:59] God to do that. No mechanics or
[40:01] organizations,
[40:03] none of this can ever ever do it. Amen.
[40:07] As as good as their intentions are, they
[40:09] can never do it because that because
[40:11] that it takes God to do this. The Holy
[40:14] Spirit.
[40:15] You cannot do the work. It is the Holy
[40:18] Spirit that is doing the work.
[40:22] But now according to the prophecy, there
[40:26] will come the headstone. Yes.
[40:28] And I want you to notice that when the
[40:30] headstone comes, the prince that is
[40:32] going to cry out, the the message will
[40:34] cry out, "Grace, grace." For it is by
[40:38] grace are we saved.
[40:41] That that not of works, lest any man
[40:43] should boast. And the message of grace
[40:46] had been tramped under the feet of men
[40:48] until it is become a disgrace. Some of
[40:50] them runs out into eternal security, you
[40:53] know, and and then you can do whatever
[40:55] you want, however you're already saved.
[40:56] And that's wrong.
[40:58] Some run out into everything, but the
[41:02] true message of grace remains the same.
[41:06] And there's where Satan tries to knock
[41:08] it off, knock it out from the church.
[41:10] But it is the grace of God that we are
[41:13] all saved by.
[41:15] In other words, the messenger in this
[41:18] last age has come with a message of
[41:20] grace to the bride.
[41:22] Amen.
[41:22] It was like Serubbabel. He built the
[41:25] second temple and the ministry of this
[41:27] last age has come with shouting of grace
[41:30] and grace and it is building Christ's
[41:33] temple.
[41:34] Now this is our time. Now this is the
[41:36] time where where the Serubbel Serubbabel
[41:39] in in the in this last age had come and
[41:42] now it had had come with a new message
[41:45] and it's the message of the Bible but
[41:47] it's a message of grace.
[41:49] Grace grace unto you tonight.
[41:52] Amen.
[41:53] Amen. That's the grace of God that we
[41:55] can rest tonight that it's not by your
[41:57] works.
[41:58] Amen.
[41:59] Because you see some some some churches
[42:01] preach preach that it is by how many
[42:03] works, how many people you bring to the
[42:05] church, how many Bibles you bring to uh
[42:07] to church on Sunday. Those are works.
[42:10] What if you forget your Bible? Then
[42:11] you're out of grace.
[42:13] But then other people go to the other
[42:15] side and say, "Well, I don't have to
[42:16] bring my Bible. It doesn't really
[42:17] matter." That's the those are both sides
[42:19] of of the road. But I want to be in the
[42:22] center that I'm doing it because I love
[42:24] Christ. I'm doing this because of I love
[42:26] him and nothing else
[42:28] and now because he is living in me. The
[42:31] giver of grace is now living in me
[42:34] and he makes me do things that may be
[42:37] crazy to the world but it is him.
[42:40] Amen.
[42:42] Now
[42:43] we have good time here.
[42:44] Yes.
[42:45] Ezekiel 36.
[42:50] Ezekiel 36:22 it says, "Therefore say I
[42:55] unto the house of Israel, thus say the
[42:57] Lord God."
[43:04] And I love this scripture
[43:07] because the Lord is speaking to Ezekiel
[43:10] and it says, "I do not I do not uh I I
[43:13] do not this
[43:15] for your sakes, oh house of Israel, but
[43:18] for mine holy names sake, which ye have
[43:22] profaneed among the hidden, whether ye
[43:24] went." And then it says, "And I will
[43:27] sanctify my great name which was profane
[43:30] among the heathen, which ye have profane
[43:32] in the midst of them. And the heathen
[43:33] shall know that I am the Lord, sayeth
[43:36] the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified
[43:38] in before their eyes. And then there are
[43:42] nine things here that
[43:44] uh Ezekiel is going to say that the Lord
[43:46] is going to do,
[43:47] right?
[43:47] But I want you to notice something here.
[43:49] And if you guys want to put them there,
[43:51] it says,
[43:53] "For I will take you from among the
[43:54] hidden.
[43:56] I will gather you out of all the
[43:58] countries, and I will bring you into
[44:00] your own land."
[44:02] Isn't that happening to us today? Yes.
[44:04] The Lord is bringing us from our our our
[44:06] kind of trouble minds and he's bringing
[44:09] us to the word to our own land because
[44:12] now this word is our land.
[44:15] And it says then I and gather you out of
[44:18] all countries and I will bring you into
[44:20] your own land. Then I will sprinkle
[44:23] clean water upon you and ye shall be
[44:26] clean. From all your filthiness, and
[44:28] from all your idols will I cleanse you.
[44:31] And a new heart also will I give you,
[44:34] and a new spirit will I put within you.
[44:36] And I will take away the stony heart out
[44:38] of your flesh, and I will give you a
[44:40] heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit
[44:43] within you, and cause you to walk in my
[44:45] statutes, and you shall keep my
[44:47] judgments and do them. Now, think about
[44:50] these nine things. I will take you from
[44:52] among the the heathen. I will gather you
[44:55] out of all countries. I will bring you
[44:57] into your own land. I will I will spring
[44:59] I I I will spring clean water upon you
[45:02] and I will cleanse you from all your
[45:04] idols. Just think about it.
[45:06] I want to ask you where do you see your
[45:09] name that you have to do something here?
[45:13] What is the Lord saying? I will do it.
[45:15] And I I'm not going to do it. If you
[45:17] start reading that that chapter, it it
[45:19] is it is not it is not saying that it's
[45:21] going to do it just for you, but it's
[45:22] like for my name's sake.
[45:26] But he's saying, "I will give you I will
[45:28] give you a new heart." Isn't that
[45:30] beautiful that you have a a stony heart,
[45:33] a heart that didn't have feelings?
[45:35] Yeah.
[45:36] But when you came to the Lord, he made
[45:38] the the open heart surgery and then he
[45:41] took that stony heart from your life and
[45:44] then he put a he put a heart that could
[45:46] feel a heart that could could have
[45:49] emotions.
[45:51] Emotions are good. I mean, Amen.
[45:54] He did that and but he but my my take on
[45:58] or like what I have learned from this
[46:00] scripture is like he is doing the work.
[46:04] I will do it. I will take away the stony
[46:07] heart and I will put a new a new spirit
[46:10] and a new heart and and and and then it
[46:13] says and I will give you a new spirit.
[46:15] He is not his spirit yet because if you
[46:18] think about it with your current with
[46:21] your own spirit you couldn't even get
[46:22] along with yourself.
[46:26] Then he comes and then he gives you a
[46:28] spirit that can can can match to his
[46:31] spirit and then he comes and and and it
[46:34] says the the last uh work that he's
[46:36] doing he's here he's saying I will put
[46:39] my spirit. Aren't you grateful that he's
[46:43] putting his spirit in your life?
[46:46] But he is doing the work not by might,
[46:49] not by power, but by my spirit. Say the
[46:52] Lord.
[46:53] Amen.
[46:53] Says the Lord. Amen.
[46:55] It is a work of grace.
[46:57] I am surrendering every day. And he's
[47:00] taking absolute control of my life,
[47:03] guiding me on the journey. Amen.
[47:05] Bringing conviction into my life.
[47:07] Yes.
[47:08] Yes.
[47:08] And again, not condemnation. Right?
[47:11] That's different.
[47:11] Amen.
[47:12] Because because condemnation, you were
[47:14] under the law. They will find you at
[47:16] fault and you were death.
[47:18] But conviction is like the Holy Spirit
[47:21] comes to your life when you have said a
[47:22] lie.
[47:25] Amen.
[47:26] Or the kids when they moms tells them
[47:28] tells them not to get the cookies and
[47:30] they grab them anyway.
[47:34] Then they say, "I didn't do it." And
[47:36] then you can see the chocolate here,
[47:38] right? And then you know they are
[47:40] discovered. But grace mom says well it's
[47:43] okay just this time but next time you're
[47:46] going to get a spanking. Amen.
[47:49] Amen.
[47:51] In the time of the law when someone was
[47:53] found in the act of sin there was no
[47:56] grace. They were guilty of death. But
[47:59] when Jesus came he came not only to
[48:01] fulfill the law
[48:03] but he came to magnify it. He came to to
[48:05] fulfill to fulfill it. And I can tell
[48:08] you, he has paid it all for us.
[48:11] That's that's my message for you
[48:12] tonight. He has paid it all. He's doing
[48:15] the work. I'm just resting.
[48:19] And then the prophet of God says in this
[48:22] other quote that we have, he says in the
[48:24] de deity of Jesus Christ, if the Lord
[48:27] God could come there and confirm that it
[48:30] is the truth, not only that, but by his
[48:32] word, he confirms
[48:35] it is the truth. And by signs and
[48:38] wonders he confirms it is the truth.
[48:41] Then also grace
[48:44] is the truth.
[48:46] Then why could anyone criticize and say
[48:48] that grace is wrong that we are saved by
[48:51] works? We are saved by grace.
[48:56] That through faith not by works. Works
[49:00] shows that you have been saved.
[49:03] So what was first the grace or the
[49:05] works? Grace. Grace was before the law.
[49:09] Grace was in the law. Grace was after
[49:14] the law. And grace is the one that is
[49:17] going to take me home.
[49:18] It's just grace.
[49:20] But what saves you? It is the grace of
[49:23] God. Grace saves you. Grace is what God
[49:27] does for you. Works is what you do for
[49:30] God to show appreciation of what God did
[49:33] for you. Amen.
[49:35] If I come to church, it's just to show
[49:37] him that he had done a work in my life.
[49:41] If I serve him, it's just to show him in
[49:44] a way of being grateful that he had took
[49:46] me out of of the miracle clay.
[49:49] Amen. But by grace are you saved. Amen.
[49:54] Because of his grace, the law came.
[49:56] Because of his grace, Jesus came.
[49:58] Because of his grace, he sent his spirit
[50:00] in the day of Pentecost. And because of
[50:02] his grace he will be we will be here. We
[50:05] will be out of here one day.
[50:07] Amen. How many are grateful for that
[50:09] grace. Lord you are doing the work. You
[50:13] said that you started the good work
[50:16] and it is just not not not only a work
[50:19] but it's the good work in my life. You
[50:22] will be faithful.
[50:24] You are faithful Lord. You can tell him
[50:26] tonight Lord you are faithful to to
[50:29] fulfill your word. If there is something
[50:31] that I need tonight, Lord, you are
[50:33] faithful to fulfill your word because
[50:36] you promised it, Lord. You said that.
[50:39] You say, "Cry unto me and I will draw
[50:41] nigh to me and I will draw nigh to you,
[50:44] Lord. You said that I believe it
[50:46] tonight." And I'm crying out to you,
[50:48] Lord. You said that you you by your
[50:50] stripes I am healed. Lord, my mind is
[50:53] troubled tonight, Lord. By your stripes,
[50:56] my my mind can be healed. Amen.
[50:59] That's his promise.
[51:01] Amen. But we can finish with this. What
[51:04] is the key? The key is yielding.
[51:08] You just have to yield. And that's the
[51:10] hardest part.
[51:11] Yes.
[51:12] Because you know the human nature, we
[51:14] are always, you know, we like to know
[51:16] what's going to happen. We like to plan
[51:18] and it's good to plan. You know, the
[51:19] Bible speaks about it. But you can we
[51:23] plan trusting in the Lord?
[51:26] Amen. Because then if if you if you kind
[51:29] of start your planning and then
[51:30] something is not is not going to come
[51:32] the way you want it, then you're going
[51:33] to be disappointed. Then you're going to
[51:35] be like, "Oh, it is not happening the
[51:37] way I wanted it." But why don't you
[51:39] trust in the Lord? The prophet of God
[51:41] says, "It is such a marvelous thing and
[51:44] yet it is so simple. We just we will
[51:46] just stop and think. We press, we
[51:49] quiver, we fear, we get in frustrations
[51:52] and doubts just thinking, well, I must
[51:55] press in." It isn't that. It is just
[51:58] yielding.
[52:00] Amen.
[52:01] Realizing that you are nothing.
[52:04] Amen.
[52:04] And just let him completely take you
[52:07] over, take over your thinking.
[52:10] You see, you see here, he's not talking
[52:12] about your heart. He's not talking about
[52:14] your mind.
[52:15] Just let him take control of your mind.
[52:18] Yes.
[52:18] Amen. And And I don't mean to walk up
[52:21] with Christ with just a blank mind. I
[52:24] don't mean that. You come to him in your
[52:26] right mind, in a penitent mind and
[52:29] humble and then say, "Lord Jesus, here I
[52:32] am. Now it is written here in your word
[52:35] that you had many things yet to say to
[52:37] the disciples. You say they could not
[52:40] bear them now." And perhaps that is our
[52:43] case today. We cannot understand them.
[52:46] Amen. But what do we have to do? You
[52:48] have to yield and think that you're
[52:51] nothing. And then the next one, and
[52:52] we're almost closing here. Somebody said
[52:55] that's the lie that the preachers always
[52:56] say. I'm closing.
[53:01] You don't use the Holy Spirit. The Holy
[53:03] Spirit uses you.
[53:06] See, you are you you are not to use the
[53:09] Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit got you. A
[53:13] gift is not something you take like a
[53:15] knife and sharpen a pencil with. It is
[53:17] yielding yourself to God and getting
[53:21] yourself out of the way. Yes sir.
[53:25] So the Holy Spirit can use you.
[53:26] Amen.
[53:27] So in the first one he's talking about
[53:30] yielding and let him com completely take
[53:34] over your thinking. And now he's telling
[53:36] me yield yourself and get yourself out
[53:39] of the way. How many would like to do
[53:42] that and say Lord just take me out of
[53:45] the way
[53:46] and you take control tonight. And we can
[53:49] say with this if the musicians can come
[53:51] being confident of this very thing that
[53:54] he which have begun a good work in you
[53:58] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[54:01] Christ.
[54:02] Then Psalms 118:21-24
[54:04] it says I will praise thee for thou has
[54:07] heard me.
[54:09] How many can say that Lord you have
[54:11] heard me and you are my you have become
[54:15] my salvation. The stone with which the
[54:18] builders refuse is become the headstone
[54:21] of the corner. And then this is the
[54:26] Lord's doing again. It's not your doing.
[54:29] It's not your walk. This is the Lord's
[54:32] doing. And it is marvelous in our eyes.
[54:36] I am overcoming every day. And like
[54:38] Lord, that's wonderful. But what who is
[54:41] overcoming? It's not you overcoming
[54:42] every day. It is him doing the work. is
[54:45] marvelous in your eyes and then this is
[54:48] the day which the Lord had made. We will
[54:51] rejoice and we'll be we will be glad in
[54:54] it. How many can say Lord thank you this
[54:56] is my day. This is my hour Lord that I
[54:59] can rest and you are doing the work.
[55:03] He that started the work the good work
[55:05] in your life he is faithful to complete
[55:07] it.
[55:08] If you have a question tonight you can
[55:10] ask ask him the Lord why is this
[55:12] happening to me? Just ask him. When you
[55:14] have a qu when you have a question, he
[55:16] always will have an answer. And
[55:17] sometimes the answers he will give you
[55:19] will be a no, but at least you get an
[55:21] answer.
[55:22] So if we bow our heads and we bow our
[55:24] hearts and we just want to let's thank
[55:26] the Lord. Heavenly Father, thank you
[55:28] once again. Thank you for your word.
[55:30] Thank you for your children. They have
[55:32] been so attentive Lord to your word.
[55:34] Thank you for this word Lord that this
[55:38] the
[55:39] the builders they rejected these very
[55:42] words Lord that we can receive tonight
[55:45] and now everything that was rejected now
[55:48] it had found its dry place Lord it had
[55:51] found a resting place and that's in my
[55:53] heart tonight Lord if there is someone
[55:56] tonight here Lord that they they don't
[55:57] know you or like they are still
[55:59] wondering or questioning themselves
[56:00] Father may you give them answers tonight
[56:03] may you tell them that you have started
[56:05] the work in their lives and that you're
[56:08] faithful to complete it until the day of
[56:10] the Lord. Lord, may you give them those
[56:12] answers. May they can yield to you. May
[56:15] they can step out of the way, Father.
[56:17] May you speak to their hearts, Lord. May
[56:20] you be like that mother eagle feeding
[56:22] the eagllets, Lord. Mouth to mouth,
[56:25] Lord. That's what we want tonight. We
[56:27] are grateful for your word. We're
[56:29] grateful for your people here tonight.
[56:31] May you bless them um as they they have
[56:34] been here. Lord, we thank you. We bless
[56:36] your name in Jesus name. Amen.
