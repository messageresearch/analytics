TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ruth chapter 1 just like to read verse 22 and then just jump right into it and i'm excited about the things that we have to share this evening and trust they'll continue to be a blessing to you in this subject verse ruth chapter 1 verse 22 said naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter-in-law with her so naomi's returning ruth is being brought in through this which returned out of the country of moab it's interesting that they use the phrase return so there's some image of a returning here as it relates to the type of roof and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest and that's just the phrase there that i think that stands out to me so much they came to bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest and we'll just stop there i'm anxious to read into chapter two but we'll just stop there you can be seated i always feel pulled a little bit to start backgrounding more on just how we arrived at the service that we're in right now but we've had um i think maybe a dozen or so services on this particular subject of being the hunger and thirsting for righteousness and really the inspiration behind it is brother branham saying the living bread of life bringing forth the bride and that's the message of the hour you have the messenger a prophet bringing a word revealing a word bringing a restoration of certain things opening up certain things that is the living bread of life which we know is jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ and this revelation of christ actually brings forth the bride and god just directed us into the book of ruth uh very supernaturally from my vantage point and i believe in a way that has edified us as a church uh from your vantage point to this book of ruth and we've been going through uh this verse verse by verse and i really hope that once we get into chapter two we might just go a little bit quickly um through them because they're just real simple things i'd like to bring out in chapter two and chapter three um that just kind of kind of we've been building to this point and i think we might be able to hit him uh very quickly but we'll just trust the lord how he'd like to proceed but in tonight on bringing forth the bride we looked at how that bringing forth means to produce even in one sense to give birth to or to give rise and it has it speaks of an introduction or something coming forth and being manifested and so the living bread of life brings forth the bride the living bread of life introduces the bride and we even find in the message of the hour that brother branham teaches us that though john introduced jesus christ it was jesus christ that introduced the faith to the jewish church to the to the believers and to the disciples so there's a christ is going to bring us forth and bring us this faith that we need in this end time and i'm wanting to kind of uh just focus on these phrases here in verse 22 naomi returned and ruth the moabitess we recognized her as being the gentile type her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab so naomi is returning ruth is also uses this phrase returning out of the country moab it says and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest and we ended last wednesday night how that this is harvest time it's coming in harvest time we've been seeing this consistent parallel brother branham's teaching about how ruth represents the bribe and this barley harvest i think where we specifically ended is reading how that brother bram says this capstone is the vindication that the rapture is at hand christ is the mystery of god being revealed to the bride and these secrets that are being revealed to her and this revelation that was in the back part of god's mind being made known to the bride is the vindication that the the rapture is at hand and so when naomi is returning and she shows up in bethlehem judah and they're harvesting the barley and they're actually returning from these different festivals and these feasts that they would have been offering at this time it was the proof that the lord had visited his people it was proof of the presence of god it was proof of this restoration and it was proof that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread because that's how naomi's return is introduced that when she had heard that the lord had visited his people and giving them bread she said i'm going to return back to bethlehem judah and so it's this visitation of the lord this harvest time it's the living bread of life that's actually brought you forth had there not been a message we wouldn't be gathered in this these conference rooms of the hilton garden inn uh where we are right now as a group of people can we just all admit that that all our different backgrounds and who we are and and where we were born and the path of life that we've come from it's the word that's gathered us it's the word that's brought us together this is not just family relationships as to why we're here and brother branham makes the statement and this day this scripture is fulfilled he says there's to be a spiritual bride raise up it's the phrase he's using there's a spiritual bride that's going to raise up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith of abraham's royal son he says she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is the promise that's given to her so that's uh i want you to see that she's to come on the scene she's to rise to rise up she's to be made manifest in christ is a mystery god revealed i believe he's saying she is risen by the power of this revealed word she has risen she's beginning to raise and this is a a truth that we see today that it's this raising up of the bride and he says she's to come on the scene in the last days and he says the time and the place is a promise and in verse 22 we see the time and place ruth is coming to bethlehem at the harvest time and coming to bethlehem at the harvest time is the type of the bride's time and place just doesn't tell us that oh and naomi and ruth went back to bethlehem judah now remember this story has these different names these different times and seasons and events because they hold a type and a revelation of what god is what he is to you and how you can receive them and so there's these beautiful types and revelations contained in here and so as ruth and naomi are coming to bethlehem all right we just say as they're coming back to bethlehem judah the time was the barley harvest the place is bethlehem as they come back the scripture is telling she has come she's come they came to bethlehem the place at the beginning of the barley harvest the time and i was pondering these things today and maybe this is just kind of my way of opening up something for you to ponder in the lord to speak to your heart in other ways but redemption is what brought naomi back to bethlehem whether known or unknown whether naomi actually met in her mind well the lord has visited my people and giving them bread and i disobeyed by leaving so i want to be restored and going back and it's restoration that brings her back and she says oh well the lord has visited my people and given them bread so i know their substance and i know there's a law that there's the kinsmen would could redeem me and there could be a redemption of everything that elimelech lost and so there might be with her husband so there could have been a very conscious effort on her part to know the law and say that if i go back to this place there's redemption there because there's no promise for naomi in moab and so for her it's redemption whether known or unknown that brings her back it's restoration that brings her back now we can look at the end of the book and we've read the whole book and the whole story and we know that it's redemption that works through this story we know there's a reconciliation we know that there's a restoration but remember that if even if it's unknown or hidden that's the force that brings naomi back that's the force that's drawing her back to bethlehem judah and so ruth she's a widowed gentile and her type now for her she makes a choice to leave moab and i know some of this is just review for you but i wanted to touch on these things so they could be part of the picture that we're painting this evening she's a widowed uh gentile which makes me think about the the gentile bride whose first husband is dead thank god and so she's a widowed gentile and she makes a choice to leave moab and so we can begin to see just in these different elements there's many different ways that ruth types the gentile bride and types us as a christian and in making her choice to leave moab it's the type of hour leaving sodom or turn it leaving the world and and leaving laodicea and rejecting the things of the world rejecting sodom and being in the place where the son of man is revealed abraham and his group called out were identified with that and so then ruth and coming out she comes to canaan she comes to the promised land but just not at any time of the year she comes to the promised land at harvest time and think about how that type is for us we've come to the new birth not during a reformation not e not during a deterioration not during a time of an eating away not during the time of reformation not in the in the age of of the reformers uh but we have come to the new birth which is a prom part the believer's promised land the baptism of the holy ghost during the harvest time like we have we haven't come to the new birth in just an age of restoration of the gifts we didn't come to the uh the new birth in the age of uh of sanctification or justification we came to the new birth and we've been sealed into the body of christ in a time when the promise and the climax is a change of our bodies so the bible just doesn't say that ruth went back to israel and she found herself a husband and it redeemed the land of elimelech but it says she comes back to barley harvest to signify she holds a type for those of us today who've come out of the world into christ during this season and during this time now just to continue to look at the time and the place and i realize you guys are kind of really pulling on me in a way where i'm getting all enthusiastic and and excited and i really want to just point out some things more on a teaching point here in a moment but we'll work through it we'll do some treating as it is and uh and we'll make it but the time was uh we last last wednesday we used nissan which would be the modern modern month but the time was aviv and that would correspond to the first it's the first month of what was the ancient hebrew calendar would be the time the timepiece they would be going by at the time the calendar that they were going to at the time it would correspond to the month of nissan we're looking at those particular dates on how the feast of the passover is on the 14th the next day the feast of unleavened bread began on the 15th lasted for seven days and then the there was this uh the feast of weeks that would begin the feast of pentecost and those things so there's a lot of different things that were uh mentioned in that and the word of eve literally means barley ripening and that's how they named that's how they named their month they named their month barley ripening and so by extension because this is the time when there's a ripening by extension it means the spring season in hebrew so they had a month a spring think of what spring represents life coming forth and a cycle uh renewed and and and so it speaks of life coming and things being fertile and things sprouting and so aviv to the to the in the season it's literally the spring season or the barley ripening that's the time now because we might seem to kind of leave this subject but as we did last time we're just showing all these different things that are symbolized in this phrase that they came to bethlehem in the barley season and all the things that this is meant to signify to us like this is the time that ruth comes this is the time that we've come and so we begin to realize the importance in recognizing our day and its message and all the things related to it now there's a number of things that we could express here but i wanted to use just two scriptures to identify just how important of eve was to israel and in exodus chapter 13 when god is telling them to uh that they're going to have the feast of what the passover lamb and we have the feast of the passover that's instituted and he's given them their instructions they're going to apply the token they're going to get all the leaven out that whole time and season when god gives it to him he says this is going to be the beginning of days for you this is going to be the beginning of months and it's in that time in exodus chapter 3 that he completely does away with her old time piece their old calendar says we're starting all over and it becomes a whole new time a whole new season he says now beginning now is your first month and so this is when their calendar begins is at this time this eve so it's a new beginning it's a fresh start things are starting all over for them and moses said unto the people in verses three and four remember this day in which which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by the strength of the hand by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place so it's a leaving of egypt from one place from moab for ruth into bethlehem judah for israel out of egypt on their way to the promised land and he says there shall be no leavened bread be eaten and so this goes into the feast of unleavened bread that they celebrated in festivals he says this day came you out in the month of eve so notice the timing now he says this is remember this day this time that you came out god even himself is saying it's this month this is when you came out and it was the time of just look at it it's the time of the exodus and and it's awesome to think that naomi is leaving moab and coming back and traversing across the very same place that her forefathers would have crossed when they came into israel and how that they would have come out of egypt and now she's coming out of moab and it coincides with the very time that god had originally called them out of egypt according to what a promise of i'm going to give you back the land of your father's restoration in a bringing back and restoring these things so it was the time of the exodus which because the time of the passover and all these things and so it's a time of redemption it's a time of restoration it's the time of the first fruits it's a time it's a time of resurrection these are all the things that we're wanting you to ponder and to think about in these images of this type of this season that they're returning to bethlehem judah in deuteronomy chapter 16 verses 1 and 2 it says observe the month of abiv so this month was a special month to them this time which habib meanings barley ripening barley harvest spring season this is the time that that the season the time and the place that we're focusing on and it says observe the month of abe and keep the passover until the lord thy god for in the month of eve the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flocks and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there now originally when i was going to get into some specifics out of god's provided place of worship and this chosen place and the scripture just fits so perfectly with it because that place exists today there's a place there's a place that this word brings us to there's a place where this restoration is transpiring there's a place that we have to be led so you can see that now it brings the time which is the barley season it brings the time which is the exodus and the and these different elements and it brings the place together now he's actually prophetically speaking there's going to be a place where i put my name and he chooses that place in jerusalem and chooses that place in the temple and he's bringing the time and the place together and just i i didn't include it in this slide but i wanted to mention it this way i mentioned another place just so you can see how perfectly the symmetry is and how beautiful these parallels are so you see that this month this barley ripening month is the time of the exodus it's when all these important feasts that are going to form these cornerstones of the springtime feasts for israel transpire and it's this time now remember that naomi and ruth are returning to bethlehem judah and then even though israel in this great exodus when they leave they get kind of circling this mountain they spend all these decades roaming into the wilderness but when they finally come to cross over in joshua chapter 3 verse 13 it says and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priest that bear the ark of the lord and the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand up on upon a heap so he's describing prophetically now because they're getting ready to cross over to finally do what moses said they were going to do fulfill the messenger's promise they're going to cross over into jordan and he's describing how the priests who are bearing the ark of the lord that when they come to the waters as soon as their feet touch it the waters are going to roll back and it says and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people and i'm realizing i might have wrote down the wrong verse here but we'll find it here it is it's in verse 15. all the way the priests bearing the ark of the company for the people and as they bear the ark were come unto jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water i wish i would have put it on this slide for dramatic effect for jordan overflowed all his banks all the time of harvest and it's actually speaking to the barley harvest again like the very time when the priests are now putting the ark over their shoulder fulfilling moses's message and they're fulfilling the promise that he gave the people at the time that he called them out of egypt but it's not just calling out of it's entering into it's those two parts of redemption so now we see that after all these years our prophet moses message is being fulfilled at the very time that they left in the exodus it was the beginning of the barley harvest it was aviv it was the springtime now as they're finally entering in it's almost as if it sinks back up and they're now entering in at the very same time and the bible points it out because at this time the banks begin to overflow because it was harvest time this early spring harvest isn't this wonderful to see these things and so as much as i would love to it kind of in my nature is just kind of you know and maybe even you feel this way sometimes okay you made the point and then i just keep drilling deeper and deeper and deeper it's like you're still making the same point you're still making the same point and now i know i'm doing that even tonight but i want to move from that now and just point out how christ even comes and points to the same time and season prophetically in this hour so when he says this is going to be the beginning of months for you the the avid the barley ripening and it kind of establishes this memorial in this new season this new time and it's the exodus and its redemption and it's bringing back to abraham the faith of abraham and all these things transpiring and bringing them back and then we see that it lines back up when they finally cross over jordan it's lining back up in the book of ruth when naomi and ruth come back in what an exodus out of moab coming right back in at the very same time so you see this symmetry now christ comes who was born in bethlehem who is this bread of bethlehem who is typed of boaz we're in the very next verse it says and it begins to talk about how they came into bethlehem and even if i knew i wouldn't be able to get away from it and it says as they come into it begins to speak how boaz comes from bethlehem into the field where where where ruth is so these things are typed in the book of ruth but now here christ is the fulfillment of it what this foreshadowed he's the substance of and he comes and he prophesies very specifically about events that are going to be relating to the gentiles and to the jewish nation that's being even symbolized in these actions of elimelech symbolized in these actions and in exodus and in the old testament and i'm just going to read from one place though it's mark remarked in a few other places but in mark chapter 13 verse 28 jesus says now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh the phrase in some translation it says you know the harvest time is nigh and it's speaking of this this this harvest time but this specific reference is learn the parable of the fig tree winter branch is yet tinder and putteth forth leaves it's this it's not necessarily coming to fruit it's of the fig tree and you're looking at the fig tree and the fig tree is growing at a particular pace why other things are growing at a different place a pace but it says look at the fig tree and what are we taught consistently this represents israel and even the that we understand that we identified this fig tree putting forth its branch and this and these leaves and this bud is is represented in israel becoming a nation we understand that right and so this is prophecy when jesus says learn the parable of the fig tree and we read this in matthew and mark and we read this in luke we see this parable being referenced we see it being fulfilled in the time that we're living in maybe many of us weren't born there in the time in the 40s when this was transpired and coming to head but yet it happened it's happened now for us this is the season this is the time and it says jesus says when this happens you know you've entered this season and now what's remarkable when you begin to look at the fig tree the sprouting of the fig tree where it says it it's tender and it's putting forth its leaves and so this it's the sprouting it's not like the figs we're gonna take the figs and eat them but the sprouting of the fig tree coincides with the barley harvest it's at that very time in the spring when the fig tree is putting forth this branch that you find that the the uh the barley harvest begins and so it's saying when the barley harvest is night when this omer this first sheep is going to be offered the day after the passover and you're going to begin your feast of weeks when your feast of weeks begins or it's called the feast of pentecost there's going to be these weeks that enter into may into june and i'm referencing this time frame for israel because in a little bit i want to come back to when israel became a nation and see how these things transpired even in the month of may and these things are happening at this particular time and it's no coincidence that very significant things are happening in april and may when israel is becoming a nation and jesus says that it's going to be when the fig tree begins and is tender begins to sprout forth and begins to come forth and so for israel it's the branch beginning to bring forth its uh it's the tree beginning to bring forth a new branch it's beginning to bud but at that time it's the harvest for the gentile bride it's harvest time so for israel they're just reforming but for the bride she's entering another season and so jesus points to this a sign of the end times where certain things are happening right at the time of the harvest this relates to israel the fig tree but he's orienting us to this barley harvest he's orienting us to this harvest time which is for the bride and this parable as you begin to read it in the in the passages that it's mentioned it relates to even the siege of jerusalem there's this compound type that jesus is utilizing here and in the siege of jerusalem it became the destruction of the jewish nation so i want you to point to this of all the cycles of israel where god establishes the kingdom of israel and he gives the throne to dave and he says i don't ever want it to depart from your house you find it over and over and over again god said because my promise to david because my promise to david and they went through these cycles swinging back and forth but when you go to this time when titus comes and besieges the siege of titus in 70 a.d when he comes that that ends it for centuries the jewish nation is destroyed and the siege began on april 14th three days before the passover that year the siege of siege comes coinciding perfectly with what jesus is saying about about the destruction of jerusalem and in the siege he captured the city of jerusalem he destroyed both the city and the temple so what happens when he destroys the temple there's the worship there's the place that god had put his name this is what identified the city of david the city of israel the city of jerusalem and and this begins it marks the great tribulation of israel the dissolving of the jewish nation just as they had gone away into egypt and they were there and soldiering there for hundreds of years now after there had finally been what they thought was the restoration and they have their kingdoms and they have their kings now through this oppression and this constant disobedience on their part it dissolves a nation they're no longer a nation and it destroys the center of their worship their city of jerusalem it destroys their their temple and now the jews are just scattered they have no homeland they have no nation they have no government they have no flag they have no king and that's why jesus says in matthew 24 21 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and we we can view this through the lens of as it relates to israel this was the worst that had ever happened to them and jesus is portraying now he's prophesying when he says learn the parable of the fig tree he's prophesying this as what the actual restoration or the revival of the nation of israel so it includes this siege of titus and flee for the hills and don't be caught in the city so he's prophesying of the demise and the tearing down of the jewish nation the destruction of the temple but he doesn't leave him without hope he's basically saying this is going to be the longest period that you've ever experienced since you became a nation but some thousands of years later even the phrase i think that's used that brother bram says 2 500 years since that flag had even been flown over israel but now it's going to be uh 1700 years later 1900 years later that you're going to have this this event transpire and take place but jesus is saying that's when the fig tree's putting forth its bud so jesus is prophesying of the nation israel's revival is that am i making sense i realize sometimes i i can really fail to communicate something that seems crystal clear on the chalkboard in my mind but just i stumble and trying to express it now if i've been able to at least somehow bring that image up in your mind and you can see scripturally now with the background that you have in the message because this is this is not just kind of me over here you know kind of scatter shooting on a wednesday afternoon trying to come up with something to preach this comes from knowing what the message teaches studying the message and without having to belabor some of these points we know what brother branham said about the fig tree we know what he said about israel becoming a nation and then we've gone through painstakingly in a way over the type of naomi and the type of orpah and the type of ruth so now catch this parallel naomi brother ram types to israel we see naomi representing israel ruth is a type of the bride orpah is a type of the laodicean church and so she has this representation in the formal church the lukewarm church and we saw that how she begins she starts out just like lots uh lot does and lot's wife did and we see that even moab uh comes forth from lot's daughters and we see all this symmetry so now when laodicea begins and and i get just trying to give some quick history here and i'm wanting to do it maybe more just in an informational way just so you can see how beautifully this these things line up for us 1906 it ushers in the laodicean church age and what was there a there was a birth of the pentecostal revival it's pentecostal movement they're in california and god comes and he stirs this azusa street revival up and we know it was genuine we know it was real it was the last order of the reformation it was the restoration of the gifts back to the church the church is experiencing its revival and and without maybe belaboring that that identifies the move of the in the pentecostal age which is the laodicean church age which brother branham types to orpah now why did he type it to orpah because she went so far but then turns back they thought this is the long-awaited restoration but no that wasn't it there was still yet another promise to the church and so before even world war one was over and and for those of you who like to stay on top of your history it was called the great war before it was world war one because they hadn't quite anticipated that it would be one of at least two and so if anyone time travels and comes back and says um uh which you know where that they say we just escaped world war three then you know there's going to be at least maybe another a third one but before world war two one was even over pentecost was our uh um organizing right so think of this this revival breaks out for these few years and it and it kind of has this momentum and goes forward for several years but even i try trying to find some specific statements today and i just don't have the time where brembo talks about 15 years and not even 20 years and 10 years and these organizing these revivals that didn't even very last very long in the assemblies of god organizes and denominates then the pentecostal church of god organizes and denominates and you find this because it happened in 1914 1916 1919 these major denominational organizations begin to form that were birthed in this real genuine pentecostal move but now it's a move of god that's transpiring a genuine unorganized move of god the messengers the holy ghost but then the devil starts to work within them and what do they do like every other church age they organize they denominate and this is happening this is what the sp where the spirit of orpah gets a hold of it and they put a period on they organize they build their walls and they put they'll build their fences and all these things are kind of put together and i just really had this real fresh inspiration fellowshipping with brother daniel evans this past week and how that he said that they built fences to keep the ducks from fellowshipping but all you got to do is let the water rise and i said just lift up the word just keep lifting up the word whatever fences man has built we can just let the water rise and the ducks will be able to fellowship and and so these things begin to organize in in 14 1914 1916 1919 and this kind of caught me when nine by 1945 is when the upc organizes and they they experience this split there's a split between the oneness and the trinitarians and the pentecostal 1945 upc organizes and what it does it really marks the death of the laodicean church this great pentecostal move dies when it organizes and what does that what does that represent orpah now i'm going to read a couple statements that uh are you familiar how brother bam talks about how it organized and it died like the life life is going to move on he even talks about how he mentions it many many many times but now just to pull back from something we'd read a passage in the church age book that we'd read before he says that poor smyrnian age was dying when it died it never come back no age ever comes back no revival ever comes back it can't have the life of god in it by natural generation it takes a regeneration from above this last age started with the fires of a pentecostal revival and they organized right back what does that mean it died and they can't regenerate themselves that's it's only going to be natural generation from then on that's why he teaches us that they cannot give birth because they're sterile and i know i'm drawing a lot of real heavy teachings from the message but this is just this is the prognosis uh that that the prophet is giving of the age and of organizations now don't think that you can organize around that prophet not be subject to the same curse because it has to be organized has to be done from above a regeneration from above and god dealing with individuals and not names of churches and different doctrines so he says instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and did just what every age has done substituted the manual for the word and so now you can see how he's bringing that parallel now they organized pentecost organized that means the revival fires have died they can't bring themselves to life again it's going to take god to do it and and just a few places spots later it might even be kind of on the same page in the church age but god poured out his spirit upon baptist methodist nazarenes adventists presbyterians brethren church of god several so named etc all these brethren were brought up on different doctrines bylaws church mammals etc god swept it all to one side he destroyed their dispensational theories and restored the gifts of the spirit proving he's the same yesterday today and forever wow look what god did for all these organizations what does he what is he establishing it's not your denominational brand it's not your theology it's not your church god's destroying all of it this should have been like the climax of the of god's gentile bribe he says god swept it all to one side and he says he says but did those pentecostals learn their lesson about organization no sir they're organized right back and have written their own textbooks bylaws and church manual fellowship book etc he's using that quite a lot in formal writing with one idea in mind which is to prove that they now have all the truth know all the answers and are therefore the elite of god who know the way and can show it unto others as god's appointed guides and i i mean i wouldn't be surprised if we're not careful that's not exactly what some people's mission statement is on their website but they haven't got it they have hybridized themselves like the very groups they came out of which is what death as soon as you do that it's death if they want to be in the bride they're going to have to come out exactly as their forefathers so all of a sudden again after this genuine move they're right back almost as it was in a moabite condition they're dead they've gone right back in it no wonder elijah had to come first and restore all things not just because there was going to be a fallen away in the time of paul but that even in the end after a great genuine move of pentecost the devil's going to say whoa this is this looks like it did on the day of pentecost everything's been brought back to even the restoration of the gifts and then he is able to get back into it and tear it down he thinks god's last final great move this great climax i've destroyed it i've succeeded but god had been hiding all along that there still is yet another last step and what i'd like to identify this falling away and going right back to what they came out of and if they're going to be in the bride there has to be another exodus they're going to be there has to be another return notice that and so what is it an orpah anointing that brings the death the fallen away and what is brother branham showing it repeating so when it says ruth returned out of moab it even gives this image of someone who had once been there left and has to come back again why did it say ruth was returning and so now and i feel like i'm doing great on time so i i don't feel rushed are you with me individual i'm asking you all individually if you follow me so far i love it when we're just family together now at the very same time that pentecost is dying the very same time that it's going in an organization very same time orpah is turning back israel's returning right at the very same time that we described these events in smyrna and we could take these times from 1906 and all these dates and and 14 and 16 and 19 of 1900s and 1945 they organized and this is them organizing this is them dying them leaving the revival and they're gonna have think about that they've gone back into organizations and in order to be in the bride they're going to have to return to the faith of their forefathers they have to return to faith what are they going to need they're going to need a message of returning they're returning the hearts message of restoration they're going to need this ministry and what what's coming on the scene at that time and so i know this might may seem to be super academic but it just startled me when i began to see these things because because i'll say this and though i if i recall it is maybe a subject of some criticism where brother branham is using dates in 40 may may 46 may 47 and and i think there's a lot at least there has been for several years and many many years none of these things are new i mean except some of the vicious lies that people try to tell now since they realize all these things have never worked before uh that there's this maybe these discrepancies and the dates that he's trying to use but he's like he's making this connection between what god's doing to israel and what god's doing to the gentile bride and it's personal to him because god's commissioning him and calling him and as he's referring to these dates and maybe they don't seem to line up to us or to others he's saying at the very same time if we could just look at it in general what he's trying to point to at the very same time that god is commissioning me to go out into the gentile church and to do these miracles and have this ministry it's at that very time that israel is returning to its homeland and becoming a nation again and that's kind of the parallel that that he's identifying when he makes those statements so remember at the very time after this genuine move of god and the laodicean church age takes place and they begin to organize in 1914 1960 1919 these are just dates that i could find when these significant denominations organized in the pentecostal move it's in 1917 that you have what's called the balfour declaration and in it it's it's this public pronouncement by the united kingdom that favors the establishment of the jewish home in palestine this was remarkable now to come out and say that we believe this pronouncement by this major country and it's called the balfour declaration where we believe that the jews should have a home in their their land that's in 1917 right about the time that the laodicean age is organizing and denominating there's this move now this zionist movement begins to get some traction to get israel back in its homeland and after world war one the united kingdom is kind of given this it's called the palestinian mandate and they're given this oversight over how what should be done to is to palestine in the role of the jews in israel in that land and by 1937 the a jewish state to have a jewish state with borders and government and a place for these jews to be a nation is explicitly suggested like we believe that there should be a jewish state that there should be a homeland restored to israel and then after world war ii the united kingdom kind of turns over this mandate of what to do with israel what to do in palestine to the the united nations which had just been established and then when the united nations makes this proclamation and this decision they make this decision in 1946 this was a significant decision it's made in 1946 they they make this decision for the immediate admission of a hundred thousand jewish refugees from europe from the holocaust and things into palestine in 1946 they said these jews who've been scattered and persecuted in their possessions torn away from him and this been ravaged by hitler mussolini and eichmann in this great holocaust and this genocide we believe that they ought to be given a place in their original home a hundred thousand of them in 1946 and guess what month it was it was april when it's explicitly declared and they say immediately these jews should be relocated back in this promised land and it was in may 1946 now think of this may 1946 that the american president president truman announced his approval of that recommendation when is it happening aviv when is it happening during that time of the feast of the weeks it's happened in the time of the restoration the reconciliat the the very time that god prophesied this is going to be an exodus for you and you're going to return to the promised land these things are happening in a political realm but look at the symmetry in 1947 the u.n formed the united nations special committee on palestine you want to guess what month that was it was in the month of may and it was the efforts of that committee this u.n special committee on palestine that resulted in the adoption of what they call resolution 181 and it was on november 29 1947 it was the partition resolution that said we believe that you ought to carve out specific borders and have a specific place that the jews can call their own and actually partition out a jewish state for the jewish nation now why okay thanks for the history lesson brother ann we thought we had graduated or picked a profession that all i needed was certifications and i wouldn't have to sit through a world history class well surprise but it's not just world history think of now what's transpiring when jesus said when the fig tree begins to put forth its branch in its tender time it's going to be during this time it's going to be in this season in this time where we can look in a bigger picture and say that these things transpire over these few years or over these several years is taking place at the very time that orpas turning around and going back but it but what's happening is israel's being brought back to their promised land that means there's got to be a ruth coming on the scene there has to be a time and a place for a gentile bride if orpah is doing her thing and israel's coming to her place and they're establishing in 1947 this partition resolution that this fig tree which was destroyed three days before the siege began three days before their passover lost all their inheritance and the jewish nation is destroyed and they're scattered throughout the world that god's going to now bring them back home and it's happened at this very time that's in 46 47 april may of 46 may of 47 then in may may 14 1948 the declaration of the establishment of the state of israel the fig tree puts forth it's big israel becomes a nation and how does brother branham identify that that that's a signal that's assigned to us that there are certain prophecies that re that are to the bride there's certain things that relate to the gentile church that means god has got to be finishing his work of redemption of the gentile bride that god has got this has got to be coming to a climax because now he's going to get ready to turn to this fig tree because eventually the figs are going to come forth and they're going to have to have their reconciliation they're going to have to have their restoration things are going to have to be turned over back to the to israel and how is that typed at the end of the book of ruth when ruth takes the child that was brought forth by boaz and hands it over to naomi and it's the christ that the the bride brings forth that's going to introduce himself back to israel as naomi takes this child again to to to nourish it and this is what we see in the book of ruth well this is literally literally fulfilling the types and shadows of ruth when we begin to look at these events in the pentecostal church age these things happening to the nation of israel i i accept that i might get more excited about this than others and i don't expect you to share the same enthusiasm i don't even necessarily expect you to see it the way i do but i'm going to read you what brother branham said and i hope you see it the way he says it because in the book i say the book of job no this is the sermon of job and uh i remember one time a brother was very very adamant that brother bradham said that when your job is on the ash heap right no aren't you sure they mean job no he said it was the job was on the ashee and so he whipped out the quote and was going to just prove it right he says right here j-o-b never mind you know he kind of realized at that moment that it was the sermon called job not the sermon of job and maybe when you understand that you know the book of job has new meaning and you don't dislike it as much as you did before he says and notice what brother baby says in the beginning when pentecost fell it fell on the jews and the jewish church died out and the gentile church come in this is this is exactly the events that allowed roof because elimelech represents israel and we could used all these scriptures in romans where paul is teaching hey this happened to the house of israel that the gentiles might be brought in and i've just avoided using those scriptures because i feel like they're just very evident to us but this is what's typed out in ruth chapter one broadband is looking at these things here and he says that the gentile church come in and then all the signs and wonders cease now notice that was the former reign then the church notice what he says the jewish church is returning just in the latter ring when the holy spirit is just being poured out again this is in 1955 so he's looking at historical events that are transpiring within the church and politically with israel and he says and the jews now returning by thousands back to palestine he says oh i wish we that's a sermon in itself time won't permit much longer i've got a hurry notice a sermon in itself so he realizes there's a lot here of the return of the jews now bringing with them the gentile so there's something as he's looking at this there's something about this return of israel to their homeland that's going to bring in these great promises to the gentile and when they got there it was barley season oh he's talking about ruth he's talking about ruth chapter one the great thrashing was on and they had a near kinsman named boaz and ruth went out to glean in the field and was directed to boaz's field which was a kinsmen when she went out to glean a type of the gentile church taking up the bible the old testament to learn of god being heathen now comes to learn of god now if you notice this it's very very uh thought provoking to me how that is clearly looking at end time events in israel returning to the promised land and how this has some impact upon the bride but now he's showing that in type it happened already and that there's a type of the gentile bride being brought into the promise at the beginning of the christian church which think of if we if we focused even on that aspect it made sense for naomi to return but the mystery of god is hid in ruth that it wasn't always just a promise to israel after the flesh but it was a spiritual promise and there was a royal seed of abraham and the mystery of god was that his bride would actually be a gentile bride and would not be the literal seed of abraham so when ruth is coming back she holds the mystery in her heart of a gentile bride oh naomi it's so good to see you well don't call me homie call me bitterness and here's the mystery standing right next to her the mystery that no god's not going to take to himself israel to be his wife she'll be his servants but he's going to take a gentile woman a gentile church made up through seven church ages and she will be his wife she will be the one that comes on the scene in the last days and so because it's represented in the church ruth also foreshadows being brought in by a naomi being given the old testament and learning of the one true god but it says that naomi is returning but ruth is also returning so there's also another type for the at the end of time for the bride's climax the bride's redemption when she's brought back when she's restored so notice how brother branham when he's referring to the book of ruth he's identifying the jewish church returning to their nation then a message god has a provided way and notice just as naomi who had lost everything she had and was returning back just in barley season and now he looks at today and palestine today is becoming the blossom like a rose some of the greatest things are found riches of the lands and the world chemicals found in the dead sea that's priceless to mention there's there's so much you can amplify in that way of the advancements technology and science and the tremendous things that have been done in palestine since the time of this restoration palestine the greatest citrus country lemons that that weigh five pounds of peace nearly raised there think of it all fulfilling god's divine word going home the jews returning in barley season so here's our prophet standing here we read from 1955 in 1954 now where he's saying do you see the jews now returning to their homeland the fig tree now putting forth this bud and these events that took place in 46 and 47 and 48 with this declaration of the state of israel and israel gives this declaration of independence identifies itself as a jewish nation raises up the star of david and is signifying the the the end of this great tribulation to israel that jesus prophesied in the book of matthew in the book of mark and now brother branham stands there as the prophet says now if the jews are coming back to their homeland it must be harvest time but not for the fig tree but for the bride this weak plant this wife of jesus christ is coming on the scene so if the jews are returning in barley season there has to be a restoration a redemption of the gentile bride so in the sermon redeeming redeemer redemption we're going to close on this we'll give our musicians our brothers just at times they'd feel led as i read this statement to come to the instruments notice and and i wanted just to read this whole thing even though we really just come to the very end where he makes these real impactful statements but what he says in here so beautiful and instructive to us notice ruth was willing to forsake her idols forsake her past life forsake her people forsake everything in return with naomi as israel is brought by the tender hand of jehovah through a genocide and a holocaust and these events transpire that will give her nationhood and bring forth this fig tree's tender root branch that at the very time where it says where the sap from the root comes into the plant and begins to express the life that is still in the tree it's at that very time that ruth is making these decisions no matter what the circumstances were she was willing to go on that's the way every man that comes to christ must first be willing regardless he goes i don't like to tell the people oh you're going to prosper and be a rich man now and god's going to bless you you're you ain't going to have no sickness because isn't that what sometimes people want to pat you on the back and say look if you give your heart to god you'll get that ladder house have you ever heard that claim atlanta house blessing right i mean you're going to i'm going to get a new car tesla's for everyone and that's kind of like the reason why we want to serve god he says i'm not going to make those kind of promises i don't promise them that because god doesn't promise them that here's this beautiful statement i say if you're really born again in your heart i don't care how rough the road gets you'll still hold on to god's unchanging hand in that right brother ernie eventually you realize something's holding you doesn't matter how rough it gets what you go through physically mentally emotionally in relationships with family you're holding to god's unchanging hand no matter what lays before me if jesus goes with me i'll go hallelujah he says as long as he goes that's all that's necessary and he says and she returned now she wasn't coming back to bethlehem where there wasn't a boaz and oh the picture now ruth the gentile church just coming in now what is this what does this look like ruth the gentile church it's the bride coming on the scene because there had been gentile church ages for centuries the church had come in through the ministry of paul and peter paul saying how he brought this church and peter the gospel going to the gentiles they had had their season and their time so what is he talking about your time bride time seed time harvest time climax restoration redemption not just an exodus out of but now an entrance into that you can see it was that time that there was an exodus but redemption has two parts so it's not just when the gentile church was brought in it's got a cycle back to the same season again for the bride to enter into [Music] man this is so good i'm not talking about me i'm talking about this what program's teaching here ruth the gentile church just coming in and naomi the jewish church coming back this time and notice when they returned they turned and went got back to the homeland they came in just in barley season now anyone knows what barley season was thank you for the benefit of the doubt brother branham because it was pentecost the firstfruits how the gentile church was brought in under the wings of almighty god at pentecost the gentile church the bride he says and when she returned it was barley season there's the parallel again this is how that the bible could be written and if it feels like brother and that's just semantics and but even when you get into the original language that's being used it's still a paradox yeah naomi's returning but ruth returns out of the land of moab why because she has to be the type of this great glorious church that god had raised up that had fallen away from its position but god has a fourth life messenger god has an elijah the prophet he's going to turn her back to the faith of the original apostles to the faith of the original fathers and when she returns she returns in a season barley season where this time there's going to be a rapture there's going to be a manifestation of jesus christ coming to its fullness and then that's going to be be delivered to naomi and ruth will have her boaz [Music] when i look at this god's brought it full circle [Music] he said the gentile church was brought into the wings of the almighty god at pentecost what did he do he brought a restoration of pentecost naomi returning to the palestine [Music] that times the fig time our time is harvest time just these events lining up so perfectly i thank god that he's put us in this season could we stand together tonight [Music] what a beautiful season [Music] if you need a touch from the lord tonight just lift your hand as we pray the lord i receive you your heads are bowed i want you to think about this if god would orchestrate history if god in the beginning would establish seasons and the war the earth revolving around the sun in order these things in such a way to where these seasons in time would fall at particular moments and then establish the israeli hebrew nation their calendar around and a lot synchronized these events to it and then when he begins to deal with the gentile church it synchronizes perfectly in a spiritual way with these things and then when he begins to politically bring back the fig tree it synchronizes perfectly with these things if god could do that over seasons and rotations and planets and all the factors that work in nations and governments and politics don't you think he has he can do something for you tonight that the timing in your body the synchronizing of your of your heart to things of god any disconcordance anything that seems un it seems broken and unfixable can't you just trust him tonight and maybe you could just say his brother bran admonished us to say i'm really born again and i don't care how rough the road gets if jesus goes with me i'll go knowing that he's got it all in control he's working all these things out so perfectly so beautifully i'm not looking for affirmation right now for you to pat me on the back but it can you express it maybe with an amen or a hand raised do you see do you see how these things synchronize and line up you see the time and place that ruth comes and naomi come to bethlehem at a time barley harvest in a place bethlehem and there's a time and a place that it signifies for us as the bride can you see this then can't you believe tonight that god will meet your need a gracious heavenly father lord i bring it to that point tonight that as we stand here as your children then we must believe that whatever the ups and downs and the revolvings and the turns and the disappointments and the persecutions and the financial pressure and the loss of friendships and whatever it might be that somehow you're still working all these cycles for our good and that this time that we're in is a season of restoration a season of resurrection and redemption fullness of redemption that father we can believe that you are mindful of what we're going through you're mindful of the difficulties and the challenges that we face and lord if ruth felt hopeless and scared that day [Music] she walked into bethlehem judah a stranger and felt like an outcast felt like she didn't belong and began to miss her sister orp and she felt all alone lord as we dramatized before we would want to tell her honey don't worry don't worry one day soon you're going to go out and glean there's going to be a man come down [Music] into the field [Music] and it's going to be your redeemer it's going to be your redemption and your name is going to be forever tied with the messiah lord if we would want to have that we could give that message to ruth can't we accept tonight that that's what your holy spirit is telling us that you've got it in control that all is well that it may be painful and it may have been hard but i'm going with you lord i see the connection with my advocate tonight yes you're with me you're going with me lord i'm not in this alone may the people tonight be encouraged as we go forward the new outlook on life a new perspective a positive attitude [Music] lord because we're going to see just what you did for ruth and changed her profession it's happening to us now so now lord we profess i am the bride of jesus christ you go with me you're going so i'll go with you and may these things line up in a very special way not theology not me trying to bring out types and tickle the people's ears the lord so that they could see just how personal you are to them individually bless us tonight i pray hands lifted up for special needs may you meet them unspoken prayer requests from our loved ones lord may you meet them comfort the morning hearts lord heal those lord that we know that are sick hospitals and afflicted by disease lord we will not be deterred we believe in divine healing we pray for the sick we believe you watch out over us we believe that all things are working together for your glory and our benefit bless your people we pray now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen say amen amen seal these things
