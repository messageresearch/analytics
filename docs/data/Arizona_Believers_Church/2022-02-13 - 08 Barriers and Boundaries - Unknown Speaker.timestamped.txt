[0:00] first corinthians chapter 13 starting
[0:02] with verse one very familiar scripture
[0:04] reading is it speaking about charity it
[0:06] says though i speak with the tongues of
[0:07] men and angels
[0:09] of men and of angels and have not
[0:11] charity
[0:12] i'm a sounding brass or a tinkling
[0:14] symbol
[0:15] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[0:17] and understandable mysteries and all
[0:18] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[0:20] that i could remove mountains and have
[0:22] not charity i am nothing
[0:24] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[0:26] the poor and though i give my body to be
[0:29] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[0:31] me nothing
[0:32] charity suffereth long in this kind
[0:34] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[0:37] itself is not puffed up does not behave
[0:39] itself unseemly seek if not her own is
[0:41] not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[0:44] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoice in
[0:47] truth beareth all things believeth all
[0:49] things hopeth all things endureth all
[0:51] things
[0:52] charity never faileth but whether there
[0:55] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[0:57] there be tongues they shall cease
[0:59] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:01] vanish away
[1:03] let's pray together heavenly father
[1:06] we're bowing our heads and our hearts
[1:08] before you today with an expectation
[1:10] that you desire to speak to us
[1:13] so now lord we purposely and
[1:15] deliberately lay aside any
[1:17] demand of our upon our thoughts in any
[1:20] other demand upon our time and we focus
[1:22] on you with this time that we do have
[1:24] together today lord we desired that you
[1:26] would speak to us in a special way
[1:28] and we're committing these things to you
[1:31] lord we pray for
[1:33] brother osario jr with this mass that
[1:36] they found
[1:37] lord may it just be gone may he be
[1:39] healed may there be no nothing
[1:40] detrimental may there any anything
[1:42] that's wrong lord just be cured now
[1:45] by by his faith in your word by this
[1:47] offering up of prayer
[1:49] lord for the different needs we have in
[1:50] our body and anyone that's sick anyone
[1:52] that's hurting anyone that finds
[1:54] themselves in a difficult situation and
[1:56] they're not sure
[1:58] which way to turn lord may you give them
[1:59] direction give them peace
[2:01] lord we pray even for brother loyal that
[2:03] he's preparing his heart to minister
[2:05] wednesday may you
[2:06] just bless him in a special way bless
[2:08] the congregation is it his first time
[2:10] ministering here lord we just would that
[2:12] anything be moved out of the way that
[2:14] would hinder
[2:15] and lord now as we approach your word
[2:18] come take control of it for your glory
[2:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[2:21] pray amen
[2:23] amen you may be seated
[2:26] now this is part eight on
[2:28] the subject of barriers and boundaries
[2:31] and i'm just going to give a quick recap
[2:33] on the subject of setting limits because
[2:35] i want to take a step further today and
[2:38] just give a recap
[2:39] on how that we took from some luke
[2:41] chapter six matthew chapter five some
[2:43] different characteristics that jesus
[2:46] speaks of about the believer
[2:48] that some could use either to manipulate
[2:50] us into uh being manipulated uh or cause
[2:53] us you know put us in a position we have
[2:55] to compromise because well this is what
[2:57] a christian does and this is what a
[2:58] christian ought to do
[3:00] and we found that as we take the whole
[3:02] word into consideration
[3:04] that those things speak to a truth and
[3:07] they're immutable and they're perfect
[3:09] but yet you can't use the word of god to
[3:11] cause a believer to sin
[3:13] and so you can't use the word to justify
[3:15] evil and we saw that the word gives us
[3:17] authority to set boundaries and that
[3:20] instead in those boundaries it is for
[3:22] our protection but most importantly for
[3:24] our perfection
[3:25] that god has not just simply put things
[3:27] in his word so that we can kind of
[3:28] navigate this life and get through it
[3:31] without being bitter but it's to remove
[3:33] any hindrance or any barrier to us
[3:35] coming to perfect faith into the
[3:38] knowledge of the son of god in a in the
[3:39] full and complete way that god wants us
[3:42] to
[3:43] and we recognize that there's measures
[3:45] of faith that are given and we want that
[3:47] faith that we have to mature to full
[3:49] measure we want to be
[3:51] from faith to perfect faith
[3:53] we know that even we have a love and
[3:55] that
[3:56] paul in philippians prays that our love
[3:59] would abound more and more in more
[4:01] comprehensive knowledge and discernment
[4:03] and judgment and so there's things that
[4:06] abound and things that grow and so the
[4:08] word of god gives us these uh things to
[4:11] live by principles to live by in ways
[4:13] that you protect your spirit and
[4:16] and avoid certain offenses and allow in
[4:19] your spirit to be defiled so that that
[4:21] keeps you free to be influenced by the
[4:23] word of god
[4:25] and as we looked at the different
[4:26] instances where god is authorizing us to
[4:30] to set a boundary or to set a limit it
[4:33] kind of works the other way as a warning
[4:36] from god to not
[4:38] violate boundaries that if if there's a
[4:40] boundary in the word of god and we we
[4:42] can set that boundary but it also speaks
[4:44] to us as believers that we don't ever
[4:46] want to cross that boundary
[4:48] and we don't ever want to engage in
[4:50] hurtful conduct or be insensitive and i
[4:53] know this is maybe very
[4:54] elementary and not anything that's very
[4:57] deep and if you have a little bit of a
[4:59] part of you that wants your ear
[5:00] scratched for deep things just keep
[5:02] praying
[5:03] and and there's plenty of deep things to
[5:05] touch on and i know it may seem very
[5:07] shallow and very surface but maybe we
[5:09] just use an example
[5:11] that we can all relate to and i believe
[5:13] the holy spirit can make it just as deep
[5:14] as you need it to be in your life
[5:16] because there's a lot of applications of
[5:18] this
[5:19] and so in setting limits we saw how
[5:22] jesus
[5:23] used the uh said if if you get smite if
[5:25] someone smites you on the cheek uh on
[5:27] your right cheek you turn to them the
[5:29] other cheek
[5:30] and in the way even brother brandon
[5:32] approached that you would ask the
[5:33] question well brother what did you do
[5:35] that for
[5:36] it's uh the setting limits that's that's
[5:38] a part of saying you know what you just
[5:39] can't treat me any way you want to treat
[5:41] me or i i don't have to subject myself
[5:44] to behavior ideas or thoughts or
[5:47] opinions that uh harm my spirit and and
[5:50] weaken my faith i can make this decision
[5:52] i don't have to expose myself to
[5:54] everything because i'm a christian and
[5:56] because i have faith and and we can
[5:58] survive it all that's not what god asked
[6:00] us to do but in the responding we saw
[6:02] that there was this demonstration that
[6:04] when you do that you're demonstrating to
[6:06] others uh what is right again for your
[6:09] protection but also for their correction
[6:12] that when you as a christian can speak
[6:14] and when whenever you say something and
[6:16] there's some very interesting pr
[6:17] principles this is just kind of coming
[6:20] into my head it's something that i
[6:21] learned recently
[6:22] that uh i'm about to use a word that's
[6:24] going to cause a lot of people to flip
[6:25] out that in the koran that jihad
[6:30] all right you with me so far
[6:32] take up another offering after we teach
[6:34] on this one
[6:35] uh that jihad is that's merely being
[6:38] able to speak not in the sense that
[6:39] maybe we think about it maybe not the
[6:41] fox news paradigm maybe let's think of
[6:43] something maybe a little bit more
[6:44] moderate uh the politico maybe how they
[6:45] would use it
[6:47] that there's a um
[6:49] that there's
[6:50] the only thing that one thing you have
[6:51] within your right is to speak
[6:54] in the face of your oppression that you
[6:56] don't have to you don't have to overturn
[6:58] anything you don't have to overthrow
[6:59] anything but one way
[7:00] to do what is right not in the sense of
[7:02] declaring jihad on all the westerners
[7:04] and christianity but just to stand for
[7:06] your faith is the one thing you can do
[7:08] is to speak up in the face of oppression
[7:11] and i thought wow that's a very good
[7:12] principle because the word of god tells
[7:14] us that that is one thing that we can
[7:16] maintain and we can do is to maintain
[7:18] our profession to maintain the right
[7:20] words and to say the right things and
[7:22] jesus
[7:23] in telling us to turn the other cheek
[7:24] wasn't telling us
[7:26] to run the other way but but to respond
[7:29] in a particular way to the offense so
[7:31] it's not fleeing it's not fighting it's
[7:33] certainly not freezing in the face of
[7:35] the offense but it's having the right
[7:37] response that protects you and provokes
[7:39] the offender
[7:40] and we can even look at it the way it's
[7:42] a christ-like response that addresses
[7:44] the violation you respond in a way where
[7:46] christ says the christ character in you
[7:48] says that's not appropriate and and and
[7:50] you do it for your protection so that
[7:52] you don't have to be influenced to do
[7:54] something you wouldn't want to do and
[7:56] then and then also it signals to this
[7:58] other person
[8:00] that that behavior that they're they're
[8:02] wrong or they shouldn't suggest that you
[8:04] say well what application does this have
[8:06] it has a lot of different applications
[8:08] there's ways sometimes that when we're
[8:10] responding to a request
[8:12] that we give an excuse
[8:14] or we answer it in such a way to where
[8:16] it's like well you know i i don't i
[8:18] don't know about that or i'm busy or you
[8:21] know i i i i'm not feeling well right
[8:24] now i don't want to do that and
[8:25] basically what we're doing is we're
[8:26] putting up a barrier to why we can't do
[8:28] it
[8:29] right
[8:30] instead of saying i don't believe that
[8:31] would be conduct becoming of a christian
[8:34] and putting up a wall
[8:35] putting up a a boundary and so there's
[8:38] ways that we can approach things to
[8:39] where we're not saying the right thing
[8:41] we're not responding the right way to
[8:42] give our testimony and to signal and
[8:44] declare look this this is what i this is
[8:47] how i feel and these are my convictions
[8:48] and you're not trying to be offensive
[8:50] and reply back with some condemnation or
[8:52] something religious but you
[8:54] you show that there's a boundary there
[8:56] so that hopefully what they do is they
[8:57] respect that they say that's a boundary
[9:00] but if you give an excuse they're like
[9:01] that's a barrier let's work around it
[9:04] let's figure out a way for you to do
[9:05] this since those are just barriers and
[9:08] those are excuses and not really a
[9:10] reason why you're taking the position in
[9:12] the stand that you have so that's those
[9:14] are just some of the things we're
[9:15] thinking about in terms of setting
[9:16] limits now we're not leaving the subject
[9:18] of setting limits but i am changing kind
[9:20] of my uh my subject or the subtitle to
[9:25] love has limits
[9:27] and this is intentionally
[9:29] thought-provoking
[9:30] because i know immediately we all start
[9:32] thinking about the songs that how
[9:34] measureless and strong and
[9:36] and how
[9:37] you know there's even one song i've been
[9:38] wanting to sing uh it's your love is
[9:41] boundless
[9:42] and and in the very opening line of the
[9:44] first verse is your love has no limits
[9:47] your love knows no bounds and so it's
[9:49] kind of like well
[9:50] i'm kind of creating friction there
[9:52] tension and that's what's going to keep
[9:53] us engaged in this service when there's
[9:55] tension so maybe some of you to some of
[9:58] you it may be just click bait oh you
[10:00] know this is just kind of a catchy title
[10:02] love has limits but i hope that you
[10:04] understand this as we look into this
[10:06] further i was even thinking this morning
[10:08] how we say we can't put god in a box
[10:10] right
[10:11] but if god wants to get in the box
[10:13] nobody's gonna stop him right
[10:15] and so it's not a matter of us trying to
[10:17] limit something but it's to understand
[10:19] what something is
[10:20] and so let's turn in our bibles i think
[10:22] some of you may already be there you can
[10:24] open your app you can flip through
[10:26] your panels of apps whatever is you use
[10:28] or you could just look at the screen
[10:30] behind me
[10:31] and look at first corinthians chapter 13
[10:33] as we read through our text again and
[10:36] touch on some points
[10:38] to
[10:39] initiate this subject this is just
[10:41] the beginning
[10:42] of looking at some of these things and
[10:44] love has limits it says though i speak
[10:46] with tongues of men and angels and of
[10:48] angels and have not charity
[10:52] i become i am become as a sounding brass
[10:55] or a tinkling symbol so there's one
[10:58] principle that i can speak with tongues
[11:00] of men and of angels but if i don't have
[11:03] charity then
[11:04] it's a sounding arrest it's a tinkling
[11:05] symbol it's something without
[11:06] distinction and though i have a gift of
[11:08] prophecy and understand all mysteries
[11:11] and all knowledge and though i have all
[11:13] faith so that i could remove mountains
[11:16] and have not charity i am nothing
[11:18] now
[11:19] i believe that
[11:21] you could take the position and it's not
[11:23] not that we would say you could make the
[11:25] argument and it's reasonable but paul is
[11:27] not explicitly suggesting that you could
[11:30] have the gift of prophecy understand all
[11:33] mysteries all knowledge have all faith
[11:36] to be able to remove mountains and not
[11:38] have charity but he's saying if i could
[11:40] right there but there is some he is
[11:43] touching on some principle that there's
[11:45] way things that you could know things
[11:46] that you could understand things that
[11:48] you could have the gift of prophecy and
[11:49] so it's maybe he's pushing it and being
[11:51] extreme well even if you had all faith
[11:53] and you could remove mountains and you
[11:55] could you could you had all knowledge of
[11:57] all the mysteries and you could uh you
[11:59] could prophesy but you don't have
[12:01] charity then what does it matter what
[12:02] does it mean at the end of the day what
[12:04] have you accomplished he says though i
[12:06] bestow and this kind of changes even you
[12:08] can see how these things each have their
[12:10] place speaking in tongues now this
[12:12] wisdom knowledge prophecy faith and now
[12:15] it's saying these actions these very
[12:16] acts of somebody
[12:18] they're unselfish acts and though i
[12:20] bestow all my goods to feed the poor and
[12:22] though i give my body to be burned so
[12:24] whether it be as a martyr for the cause
[12:26] of faith or sacrificial to preserve
[12:29] someone's life or bestow all my goods to
[12:31] give them away for charity as we might
[12:33] say and he says and have not charity it
[12:35] profiteth me nothing. so you notice in
[12:38] these
[12:39] in these first two verses that you have
[12:41] these gifts
[12:43] uh uh or the of power or greatness acts
[12:45] of power acts of greatness where someone
[12:48] could speak in tongues that's a
[12:49] demonstrable gift that would signify
[12:51] look at this person they have a gift and
[12:53] even to have a gift of prophecy and
[12:55] understand mysteries and knowledge and
[12:57] have all faith be able to move mountains
[12:59] now that's great power
[13:00] could you imagine what you might begin
[13:02] to think about somebody if they took
[13:04] west wing mountain and joined it with
[13:05] calderwood butte and created a bigger
[13:06] hiking trail you'd say wow this person's
[13:09] on another level
[13:10] and paul's saying but if you don't have
[13:12] charity
[13:13] he's saying i am nothing
[13:15] and then in verse three he's identifying
[13:18] certain acts of humility very very
[13:20] uh
[13:21] acts of service to give your body to be
[13:23] burned and
[13:24] whether to be a martyr for the cause or
[13:26] for faith or to preserve someone else's
[13:28] life or a self-sacrifice and give my oh
[13:31] sell all my bestow all my goods to feed
[13:33] the poor this is acts of service and
[13:35] he's saying but it prof it profiteth me
[13:38] nothing without charity
[13:39] so he's talked about gifts of tongues
[13:42] and prophecy uh knowledge and wisdom and
[13:45] of the mysteries
[13:47] all faith power to remove mountains even
[13:49] humility and sacrifice to give away your
[13:51] goods and to have your body to be burned
[13:54] this is the preface that paul is leading
[13:57] into this subject
[13:58] of charity
[14:00] at which he refers to as the best gift
[14:02] the thing to be desired now verse four
[14:04] charity suffereth long
[14:06] and this kind
[14:09] uh some of the other words that are used
[14:11] for kind
[14:13] is easy good gracious i think those are
[14:16] some of the words it's actually
[14:17] translated to in
[14:19] in the uh new testament easy good
[14:21] goodness and gracious but it suffereth
[14:23] long it means it's of a long spirit
[14:26] does not lose heart so it's some sort of
[14:28] fortitude and perseverance
[14:30] that perseveres patiently to charity
[14:32] suffereth long uh we find it charity is
[14:35] patient how some translations render it
[14:37] uh and it bravely perseveres this is a
[14:39] characteristic of charity it it suffers
[14:42] long it's patient it
[14:44] perseveres it's persistent it means to
[14:46] be patient in bearing the offenses and
[14:49] injuries of others that's what it means
[14:51] to be to suffer along your patient and
[14:53] bearing offenses you're you're patient
[14:55] in bearing in
[14:57] and putting up with the injuries from
[14:59] other people it means to be smile to be
[15:02] mild or slow to punish
[15:04] so it to suffer long you just uh you're
[15:07] you're slow you're slow to punish
[15:10] and then again kind is in the same sense
[15:12] shown to be mild it means to use
[15:14] kindness
[15:15] it means to be manageable
[15:17] to be pleasant as opposed to sharp or
[15:19] bitter
[15:21] and those are personality traits right
[15:23] we could think of people really sharp
[15:24] seem to be uh
[15:27] very pungent with their bitterness
[15:29] and so this is kind of the
[15:30] characteristic these are the
[15:31] characteristics of charity it's patient
[15:34] it's kind it's mild it it's manageable
[15:37] it's pleasant as opposed to bitter so
[15:40] charity suffereth long and is kind
[15:42] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[15:44] itself is not puffed up does not behave
[15:48] itself unseemly seeketh not her own is
[15:50] not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[15:53] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[15:56] in the truth
[15:57] beareth all things believeth all things
[15:59] hopeth all things endureth all things
[16:02] charity never faileth but where there be
[16:04] prophecies they shall fail whether
[16:06] whether there be tongues they shall
[16:07] cease whether there be knowledge it
[16:09] shall vanish away
[16:11] now i want you to continue to look i
[16:13] don't know if i have them all there well
[16:14] they're not all fitting maybe on the one
[16:16] slide
[16:17] but think of this
[16:20] in the all these from verse four to
[16:22] verse eight
[16:24] and think of it this way what love is
[16:26] what it does what it isn't and what it
[16:28] doesn't
[16:30] you can see it's it's broke out in that
[16:32] that what it is and what it does what it
[16:34] isn't and what it doesn't do what it is
[16:36] is it suffers long it's patient it is it
[16:38] suffereth long so love is patient love
[16:41] is kind that's what it is
[16:43] what it does is it rejoices in truth
[16:46] it bears all things believes all things
[16:48] trust in all things trust all things
[16:51] endures all things that's the hope is a
[16:53] trust to confidence and this is this is
[16:55] what it is it's patient and kind what it
[16:57] does is it rejoices in truth and it
[16:59] bears believes trust and endures all
[17:01] things
[17:02] then it tells us what love isn't
[17:05] it is not puffed up it's an inflated
[17:07] view of self it's not arrogant and it's
[17:09] not easily provoked irritated or angered
[17:13] and then that's what love isn't and it's
[17:15] here's what love doesn't it does not
[17:17] envy it does not vaunt itself push
[17:19] itself forward does not behave
[17:20] indecently does not seek her own does
[17:23] not think evil does not rejoice in
[17:26] iniquity and it says does not fail
[17:30] and when it says that charity does not
[17:32] fail
[17:34] it loops charity then what it says kind
[17:36] of i'm saying it ends on that in what it
[17:38] is
[17:40] what it isn't what it does and what it
[17:42] doesn't it says charity never faileth it
[17:45] loops right back to charity suffers long
[17:47] because it means it endures it
[17:49] perseveres
[17:50] and so it kind of loops back so you have
[17:52] charity
[17:53] suffers long charity never failed paul
[17:56] creates this loop
[17:58] now where you begin charity suffers long
[18:00] and then it's a charity never fails it's
[18:02] looped right back into what charity is
[18:04] it's an eternal circuit charity is
[18:05] something that's unending in that way
[18:07] charity is something that it's it's
[18:09] always going to be because it suffers
[18:11] long it cannot be vanquished it cannot
[18:12] be destroyed the bible says many waters
[18:14] cannot quench love
[18:16] that says our god is a consuming fire
[18:17] and god is love so these certain
[18:19] attributes and characteristics when it
[18:21] comes to love that it's something that
[18:22] it perseveres it endures it'll it'll
[18:24] ever remain we sing the song the love of
[18:26] god it shall forevermore endure
[18:30] the saints in angel song throughout all
[18:32] eternity we're going to be experiencing
[18:34] this agape the love of god and so it
[18:36] says cherry never faileth it loops it
[18:38] right back into charity suffers long
[18:41] it's it's it's an unbroken continuity of
[18:43] what love is
[18:46] and it is a standard
[18:48] as we look at it what it is what it does
[18:49] what it isn't what it doesn't it's a
[18:51] standard by which we can judge our
[18:52] attitudes
[18:54] standard by which we can judge our
[18:55] action and say is this an act of love is
[18:58] this am i doing this out of love or is
[19:00] there some other emotion that is
[19:01] motivating this is there some other
[19:03] motive and objective that is at work
[19:05] something more sinister something less
[19:06] sincere maybe something that's
[19:08] hypocritical or there's some pretense
[19:11] engaged in it something we could just uh
[19:13] we can apply to ourselves that love the
[19:15] love of god if i have the love of god in
[19:17] my heart this is a template of what it
[19:19] is and what it does
[19:21] what it isn't and what it doesn't and so
[19:23] if something is trending in these other
[19:25] areas where it does not behave
[19:27] indecently and it seeks does not seek
[19:29] its own it's not easily provoked and
[19:31] think it's no evil see what what's
[19:32] rising up and what's being quick and
[19:34] motivated is not i'm not being provoked
[19:36] unto love and to good works but i'm now
[19:38] operating in another area which it just
[19:40] said a minimum is carnal
[19:43] and then when he says that whether there
[19:44] be prophecies
[19:46] tongues
[19:48] knowledge it'll fail cease or vanish
[19:50] away
[19:51] it loops back to verses one through
[19:53] three
[19:54] so he's kind of created this circle uh
[19:56] with uh from verse four to verse eight
[19:58] and beginning of verse eight which this
[20:00] is charity here but then he comes he
[20:02] loops right back to verses one through
[20:04] three about
[20:05] tongues and prophecy
[20:08] and giving of the body
[20:10] to be burned he comes right back to
[20:12] those things and he's saying don't
[20:14] measure yourself by these
[20:18] don't just say because you could speak
[20:19] with tongues kind of like well that's
[20:20] that has to be the evidence right then
[20:22] this i've got the holy ghost which is
[20:23] the love of god or i i um i have faith
[20:26] to move a mountain
[20:28] and i'm going to put it on my work so
[20:29] i'm going to put on my understanding of
[20:30] the mysteries and all these knowledge
[20:32] he's saying that that's not the
[20:33] appropriate measure because i was
[20:34] wanting to bring it back together that's
[20:36] not something that you're going to
[20:37] measure yourself by because those are
[20:40] things that you can too easily get
[20:42] puffed up in
[20:43] those are things that you're too easily
[20:44] can start to say hey did you hear those
[20:46] tongues i was talking in earlier today
[20:48] that was i hope they had that on tape
[20:51] right and you think really big of
[20:52] yourself you hear what i did with west
[20:53] wing mountain there's a certain uh way
[20:56] that those things provoke the flesh and
[20:58] there's a different nature to cherry
[20:59] there's a different nature to love and
[21:02] paul uses the phrase it profiteth me
[21:05] nothing since he's looping back where
[21:06] there's knowledge the prophecies tongues
[21:08] they're all going to fail cease and
[21:10] vanish he's looping back to verses one
[21:12] to three and what did he say about him
[21:13] profiteth me nothing it prevails nothing
[21:17] it's better it does some of the words
[21:18] are you translated also too is it's
[21:21] there's no advantage in it it's not
[21:23] better than anything else
[21:25] it profiteth me nothing it means to
[21:27] assist to be useful or advantageous
[21:30] you don't have the advantage on somebody
[21:32] else
[21:33] because you speak in tongues
[21:35] you don't have the advantage on somebody
[21:36] else if you give all your goods away and
[21:40] sell all your goods and give them to the
[21:41] fore
[21:42] these things do not make you better than
[21:44] anyone else to where you can look down
[21:46] on somebody else
[21:48] the knowledge and understanding we have
[21:50] in the word of god today with the
[21:51] benefit we have of a book that has been
[21:53] opened uh with the benefit we have of
[21:55] such a clear a clarity brought to us to
[21:57] the revelation of jesus christ that
[22:00] doesn't lift any of us up to where we
[22:02] look down upon anyone else
[22:05] and so this is uh he's saying it doesn't
[22:07] it doesn't distinguish you it says it
[22:10] profiteth me nothing it doesn't prove
[22:11] anything
[22:13] but he is he is saying and you have to
[22:15] be very disciplined he is saying that
[22:18] there's something about love
[22:20] that has a vindication to it
[22:23] now the love
[22:24] that we might say well love is the
[22:26] evidence of the holy ghost now we know
[22:28] that's not exactly accurate right
[22:30] because then there's a certain kindness
[22:32] and love and emotion that we could
[22:34] characterize with love and say oh well
[22:36] he's so loving he's so sweet he's so
[22:38] kind he must have the holy ghost well
[22:40] they could just be really good people
[22:43] and so there's it's it's not we're not
[22:45] saying that the holy that the charity
[22:48] and a certain emotion and i have to be
[22:50] very disciplined because i know i'm
[22:51] going to be stopping short
[22:52] in the middle of this subject today and
[22:54] they may be leaving some thoughts of
[22:55] well what is what
[22:57] what would be then the context of this
[23:00] but paul was saying this
[23:02] it's not an advantage to anyone else
[23:04] it's not a proof of anything
[23:05] but jesus does say in john 13 34-35 a
[23:09] new commandment i give unto you that
[23:10] must have really wrangled
[23:13] uh
[23:14] the uh the strict constructionist right
[23:16] of the ten commandments and it's not to
[23:18] be inter it's to be interpreted
[23:19] literally and we're strict
[23:21] constructionists and this is the ten
[23:22] commandments this is the original bill
[23:24] of rights uh there's no such thing as
[23:25] amendments to this there's no uh
[23:27] interpretation of it and he says i'm
[23:29] gonna give you a new commandment
[23:30] and uh some of the orthodox jews were
[23:34] pulling their curls out he says that you
[23:37] love one another as i have loved you
[23:40] that you also so it says that you love
[23:42] one another
[23:44] as i have loved you that you also love
[23:46] one another so
[23:47] he kind of says love one another like
[23:48] hey all right we can do this
[23:50] we can love i can love you bro and then
[23:52] he says as i have loved you
[23:54] that you also love one another well i
[23:56] would say they hadn't quite fully
[23:58] understood the depths of his love
[24:01] but that changes everything
[24:03] right i mean i feel like i can love my
[24:05] family i can love i i can have a love
[24:07] for my neighbor i can love you i can i
[24:09] can love my my brothers and i can love
[24:11] my sisters and this is something i can
[24:13] do but then it says but as i have loved
[24:14] you
[24:16] that's the love that i want you to love
[24:17] one another with and he says buy this
[24:20] the same love of christ should have
[24:21] brought in our hearts by this shall all
[24:23] men know that you're my disciples if you
[24:25] have love one to another
[24:29] this kind of love leaves a particular
[24:30] mark
[24:32] not necessarily one that would cause you
[24:35] to believe that this person is right or
[24:38] that this person is
[24:40] uh
[24:42] is correct or has the truth
[24:44] but it's one he says by this men shall
[24:46] know that you are my disciples that you
[24:48] believe what i taught that you are
[24:51] that you are christians he says if you
[24:53] have love one to another was it gandhi
[24:56] that said i have that i have no problem
[24:58] with christ my problem is with
[24:59] christians
[25:01] and why because he saw that there was
[25:03] some lack of continuity in the character
[25:05] nature of christ and what christianity
[25:07] had become
[25:09] and so it's not that people would look
[25:10] at you like isn't he a christ figure and
[25:13] isn't he just divine and isn't he
[25:15] wonderful but they'll know
[25:17] that you believe what christ taught by
[25:20] the way that you treat each other
[25:22] the way you treat other people
[25:24] that believe the same thing
[25:26] so he says if you have loved one to
[25:27] another so this kind of love leaves a
[25:29] mark
[25:30] and
[25:31] and and i'm it's a distinction because
[25:33] he says by this shall all men know that
[25:37] you all are my disciples you're subject
[25:39] to my word he says if you love one if
[25:42] you have loved one to another now
[25:44] brother branham identifies this in many
[25:46] different places and kind of uh putting
[25:49] the cr the emphasis on it which is
[25:50] correct that there is a way that we love
[25:53] one another that cigna is signaling is
[25:55] signifying and evidencing that we
[25:58] believe in christ that we are brothers
[26:00] and sisters following the same truth
[26:03] and in this
[26:05] people can profess
[26:07] allegiance to christ and i'm willing to
[26:09] fight for christ even willing to die for
[26:11] christ but not willing to love by his
[26:13] live by his word
[26:15] not willing to have his spirit the
[26:16] spirit the christ have not willing to
[26:18] have the love for others that he had for
[26:21] for us and and he's identifying this
[26:24] he's saying that there's people who will
[26:25] profess christ fight for christ i'm
[26:27] willing to lay down my life for christ
[26:29] but yet not live in the love of christ
[26:34] i hope i've got you thinking
[26:37] love has limits
[26:40] brother branham
[26:41] in
[26:42] the chapter 8 of the church age book
[26:44] he's talking about the philadelphian
[26:45] church age this age of brotherly
[26:47] kindness
[26:48] if we're talking about philadelphia in
[26:50] the united states that's the city of
[26:51] brotherly shove
[26:52] but in the
[26:54] in this is the city of brotherly love
[26:58] he says now we have already mentioned
[27:00] he's using strength
[27:01] the scripture there he says now we have
[27:03] already mentioned how the strength was
[27:04] returning it was
[27:06] the power of the inquisition had waned
[27:08] people left their homelands and demanded
[27:10] a freedom of worship the yoke of the
[27:12] hierarchy was being broken freedom
[27:15] liberty we're free right
[27:17] the governments were finding it wise not
[27:19] to champion one segment against another
[27:21] so there is a loosening of restriction
[27:23] there's a little bit more religious
[27:25] freedom and you have rights and you can
[27:27] do this and you can do that
[27:29] and and governments are not interfering
[27:31] so it's really a unique
[27:32] uh kind of overview of the changing
[27:35] political landscape
[27:37] but then he he makes this statement this
[27:39] is the part i really want you to focus
[27:40] on in fact well-meaning
[27:43] so they're well-intentioned they mean
[27:45] well but poorly led
[27:48] catch this you you you mean well but
[27:50] you're led wrong we're willing to wage
[27:53] war to defend their religious rights
[27:57] so jihad certain kinds of jihad aren't
[27:58] right
[28:01] and uh think about that
[28:03] just what are some of the platitudes
[28:05] anymore that motivate people
[28:07] religious rights
[28:09] and are willing to wage war right
[28:11] topple governments storm capitals
[28:15] you know you you name it in the name of
[28:17] what
[28:19] religious freedom
[28:24] but you can mean well but be poorly led
[28:26] well-meaning but poorly led people are
[28:28] willing to wage war to defend the
[28:29] religious rights perhaps the greatest
[28:31] show of strength of religion
[28:34] is not the overthrow of governments
[28:37] not the toppling of political powers not
[28:39] the changing of legislation he says but
[28:41] in this age was the fact that though
[28:44] france fell in revolution the great
[28:45] westland revival because that's where
[28:47] the move of god was right wesley would
[28:49] be the the messenger so it's though
[28:51] there was a revolution that toppled the
[28:53] government of france but where wesley's
[28:54] revival was initiated and beginning the
[28:56] great western revival kept the
[28:57] revolution away from great britain and
[29:00] saved her to be an instrument in the
[29:02] hand of god for many glorious years
[29:04] now this is a mouthful of things that
[29:06] relate historically and even to the
[29:08] imperialism of great britain
[29:09] but he's identified an attitude where
[29:12] people can mean well they have certain
[29:14] uh motivations and have certain desires
[29:16] something they're trying to achieve but
[29:18] he's saying in doing so they're led
[29:19] poorly people are willing to fight for
[29:21] christ defend christ stand for his honor
[29:23] stand for truth and the bible says this
[29:25] as this is true and they think by any
[29:27] means necessary i i should be able to
[29:29] defend the truth as long as i'm
[29:31] defending christ and i'm willing to die
[29:32] for christ but somehow in all of it the
[29:34] nature and spirit of christ gets left
[29:36] out
[29:37] well-meaning but poorly led why because
[29:40] they are willing to wage war to defend
[29:42] their religious rights when their
[29:44] religious rights don't tell them to wage
[29:47] war to defend them
[29:51] i know i'm just causing some thought
[29:52] here but i'm so glad i'm reading a
[29:54] statement from the church age book as i
[29:56] do it well meaning but poorly led
[30:00] i touch on it because there is a sense
[30:02] of passion and affinity and a
[30:05] an allegiance that i love god and it's
[30:07] my love for god which is
[30:10] and and again i'm probably going to do
[30:12] some a little bit of a my own kind of
[30:13] ping-pong go to this side and then back
[30:15] to the other side trying to keep it
[30:17] balanced if i could just get the the
[30:18] ball to kind of hover above the net
[30:19] that's where i want to be
[30:22] but there's a real zeal and a passion
[30:24] people can have for the word or for
[30:26] christ
[30:27] and be poorly led
[30:30] because it's not him leading
[30:33] and so the love for god can be very
[30:35] easily mischaracterized but then there's
[30:37] also a
[30:39] the love of god that's in my heart so
[30:41] you say well they have a love for god so
[30:42] they're zealous they're passionate
[30:44] and and they're going to do something
[30:46] and act contrary to the nature of god
[30:49] contrary to the love of god but then on
[30:51] the other side
[30:52] we're over here now are we over here on
[30:54] the other side there's an attitude well
[30:56] if you had the love of god in your heart
[30:58] you wouldn't do this and you wouldn't do
[30:59] that now that could be said in correct
[31:01] ways as paul says what love is and what
[31:03] it isn't what it does and what it
[31:04] doesn't but then on one hand there's a
[31:06] certain image that we can have of the
[31:08] love of god if you had it in your heart
[31:09] you'd do this if you had in your heart
[31:11] you wouldn't do that that isn't what we
[31:12] would expect
[31:14] could we agree to that
[31:16] and paul is purposely contrasting
[31:19] uh the things he says in verses one two
[31:21] and three and verse eight
[31:22] uh kind of that loop that loops back and
[31:24] prophecies and tongues and knowledge uh
[31:26] ceasing failing and vanishing coming
[31:28] right back into those characteristics in
[31:30] the first three verses he's contrasting
[31:32] it with verses four to seven what what
[31:35] love is what it isn't what it does and
[31:37] what it doesn't
[31:39] and when he puts it forth there's a way
[31:40] that we could just define all the words
[31:43] and begin to understand that there's
[31:45] something there there's there's things
[31:47] here being expressed that give us a
[31:49] measure of love and that tell us what
[31:51] love is but he's really identifying the
[31:53] mystery of the measure of love
[31:55] because we can read the words it suffers
[31:57] long and is kind it does this it does
[31:59] that it doesn't do this it doesn't do
[32:00] that it's
[32:01] it is it isn't and we can begin to see
[32:04] these things but yet there's a mystery
[32:06] to it and what is it going to look like
[32:08] when it's in flesh
[32:11] now to
[32:13] kind of show some continuity with how
[32:14] we've been expressing some things in
[32:18] uh luke chapter six matthew chapter four
[32:21] and setting limits and we kind of took
[32:22] those things and read them and say now
[32:24] does this mean that no holds are barred
[32:26] does this mean anything goes does this
[32:28] mean that we can we ought to be abused
[32:29] and mistreated and put up with anything
[32:31] that no matter what our circumstances
[32:33] are and yeah i know that job is doing
[32:35] this and i know this thing is doing that
[32:37] and i know you're having to go through
[32:38] this and go through that but you're a
[32:39] christian so you just need to put up
[32:41] with it right just get happy with the
[32:43] way the devil does things right
[32:45] and not say wait a minute no i don't
[32:47] have to subject myself to these things
[32:49] and identifying that by wisdom and
[32:50] discernment with the right thing to do
[32:52] is in those situations
[32:54] in the same way
[32:55] look at some of these characteristics of
[32:57] what love
[32:58] is does isn't and doesn't and i just
[33:01] want to focus on this that it what it it
[33:03] what it does is it bears
[33:05] which means it it even keeps secret
[33:09] when it bears something it keeps it it
[33:11] suffers
[33:13] all things it endures it calmly takes
[33:16] ill treatments
[33:18] and is not easily angered these are
[33:20] these are characteristics right so if if
[33:22] those were the standard right then just
[33:24] anybody could kind of wave it in our
[33:26] face you don't have the love of god and
[33:28] we could say and you don't either
[33:31] but that's kind of the game we could
[33:32] play
[33:34] we're not and it says it thinks no evil
[33:36] so here's a characteristic
[33:38] of the measure of love it it keeps
[33:40] secret and suffers when it's been
[33:42] injured and harmed and it endures it
[33:44] calmly takes poor treatment and and it's
[33:47] not easily anger that when someone
[33:48] buffets you or treats you wrong you
[33:50] don't get irritated and riled up and
[33:51] fired back and it doesn't think evil
[33:54] now that one's really
[33:56] uh interesting to where he says thinks
[33:58] no evil and so you can't think anything
[34:00] is evil or you can't have a bad thought
[34:02] well it's the same that's what charity
[34:04] doesn't do is it doesn't think evil
[34:06] and could we all agree that love is
[34:08] misunderstood
[34:09] this agape love the love of god it's
[34:11] misunderstood because the love which god
[34:14] is is not a warm feeling
[34:17] it's not sentiments it's not emotional
[34:20] affinity it's not attraction in in the
[34:22] sense of what we say oh i love that
[34:24] person i love this and i love that we're
[34:26] speaking we're using a language that is
[34:29] referring to human emotions but when god
[34:31] speaks of charity and it's agape and god
[34:34] is love
[34:36] and you're thinking of the life of god
[34:37] and the love of god and when the bible's
[34:39] saying that love is of god and god is
[34:41] loved and that's putting it outside of
[34:43] the realm of human emotion of love which
[34:46] some of us i would say all of us at some
[34:48] point have thought that we've
[34:49] experienced
[34:50] um and it's talking about a different
[34:52] kind of love
[34:54] um there are these
[34:56] and i'm not doing anything i trust i'm
[34:58] not saying or doing anything that would
[35:00] water down
[35:01] what we've said about what love is and
[35:02] what it does and what it isn't and what
[35:04] it doesn't because these are immutable
[35:06] attributes
[35:08] they're part of love you can't take them
[35:09] away they are part
[35:11] of love but they can be misrepresented
[35:13] to paint the wrong picture
[35:16] what love is what it does what it isn't
[35:18] what it doesn't do is defining the
[35:21] limits of love
[35:24] the parameters of love
[35:25] it's the frame of love
[35:28] that when you could find out what it
[35:29] isn't
[35:30] then you could put that outside the
[35:32] picture
[35:33] when you can find out what it does it's
[35:36] in the picture when you find out what it
[35:37] doesn't then it's not in the picture
[35:39] right so it's a way of framing love to
[35:42] begin to understand what it is
[35:44] and so love we can say his love knows no
[35:46] limits his love knows no bound it's
[35:48] measureless and strong
[35:50] but love is not limitless in the sense
[35:52] that anything goes
[35:55] love is not limited uh limitless in the
[35:56] sense that uh it's not patient and and
[36:00] endures and not easily angered and
[36:01] thinks no evil in the sense that you'd
[36:03] say well love is just kind of
[36:04] indiscriminate and accepts anything
[36:07] and we can't make it to be excessive
[36:09] that love is just it's excessive um
[36:12] extravagant and it's
[36:14] it's a reckless i think that even how
[36:16] some ways it's spoken of reckless well
[36:19] i know that there's a
[36:21] is it reckless love is that the name of
[36:22] the song am i getting it right
[36:24] and uh i'm trying to remember the way it
[36:27] was changed i heard someone sing where
[36:28] they changed the words instead of
[36:29] reckless love what was it eliza
[36:32] what
[36:33] precious wow what what a contrast
[36:36] reckless and precious now that my
[36:38] pitbull's name precious and my
[36:39] chihuahua's name reckless
[36:41] i just uh-huh okay what a difference
[36:45] and uh and so but you think about it
[36:48] that kind of the way the love is being
[36:49] expressed tonight it is reckless right
[36:52] because it's like i wouldn't do that
[36:54] it seems to be reckless but when you
[36:56] when and so it's speaking i'm not
[36:57] defending the song whoever wrote it you
[36:59] know michael crowder i'm not giving you
[37:01] a shout out i don't think it's him i
[37:02] just his hair always scared me so
[37:05] couldn't listen to anything by the
[37:06] michael crowder band so don't google who
[37:09] you the songs you like right because
[37:10] you'll see the artist like really
[37:12] really no please no
[37:14] that guy wrote amazing grace
[37:16] but um where am i
[37:19] so there it's from our perspective that
[37:22] we see right we say well that's reckless
[37:24] but from god's standpoint there's no
[37:26] risk
[37:27] right so from our vantage point it's
[37:29] reckless but so it's not authorizing us
[37:31] i'm just going to live recklessly i'm
[37:32] just going to love recklessly brother
[37:34] john i'm just going to well no no no god
[37:36] god wasn't being reckless he knew the
[37:37] outcome
[37:39] but from our vantage point it may seem
[37:41] stubborn and reckless and unrelenting
[37:43] but god is not excessive and extravagant
[37:45] in the way that we would he's not
[37:46] indiscriminate paul even says let your
[37:49] love be without dissimulation that's a
[37:51] love abounding and growing into more
[37:52] comprehensive wisdom and knowledge and
[37:54] discernment and he says abhor that which
[37:56] is evil cleave to that which is good so
[37:57] that's the real marker of love is it
[37:59] doesn't just love everything and love
[38:01] everybody it knows what's evil and it
[38:04] knows what's good
[38:06] there's a phrase all is fair in love and
[38:08] war have any of us used that recently to
[38:11] justify the things that we have said
[38:13] when we were arguing anybody
[38:16] it says all is fair and love and war is
[38:18] a
[38:19] statement that's often used in the
[38:20] context of relationships and to describe
[38:23] certain circumstances and situations but
[38:25] let me just say that's not true
[38:27] of god's word and his love
[38:31] and the phrase all is fair in love and
[38:33] war suggests that in certain situations
[38:36] any method of achieving an objective is
[38:37] justified
[38:39] right
[38:40] is that kind of your understanding all's
[38:42] fair in love and war means that certain
[38:45] certain situations in love and in war
[38:48] explicitly is referencing those
[38:50] that
[38:51] to accomplish a certain objective any
[38:53] means is justified to do it in war if
[38:55] you're in a battle you're in war then
[38:57] whatever it takes to win the war every
[38:59] means to do so is justified
[39:02] and it it's literally referring to the
[39:04] elimination of boundaries
[39:06] that would exist in normal situations
[39:09] like well in this situation that's not
[39:11] appropriate in that situation you would
[39:13] never do that but in love and war saying
[39:15] that in certain contexts all the
[39:17] boundaries all the rules all the order
[39:19] is removed and it's more chaotic and you
[39:21] can do whatever you want as long as it's
[39:23] related to this you could do whatever
[39:24] you want as long as you're trying to
[39:25] accomplish this and it's used to kind of
[39:27] justify the removal of rules and
[39:29] structure and order and the removal of
[39:31] boundaries because when it's love and
[39:34] when it's war by any means necessary is
[39:37] justified
[39:38] and that's just simply not true
[39:42] it may work to justify actions and
[39:44] activities it may even describe how that
[39:46] people when there's a natural love lose
[39:48] control
[39:50] of their of their emotions and lose
[39:52] control of their actions and lose
[39:53] control of their minds because and
[39:56] they're driven to conduct themselves and
[39:58] do things that they wouldn't normally do
[39:59] and say that's because it's driven it's
[40:01] motivated by this wrong kind of love
[40:05] so love has limits
[40:07] kind of using that
[40:08] a very explicit phrasing we're talking
[40:11] about
[40:12] uh repudiation of all sphere and love
[40:14] and war or how there's these
[40:17] on one hand these immutable
[40:19] characteristics of love cannot be used
[40:21] just to paint the wrong picture
[40:23] when i say love has limits it has
[40:25] boundaries
[40:26] it has a proper expression
[40:29] there is a way and i know i want to be
[40:32] very
[40:33] uh intentional and not expressing this
[40:35] too much because i would deserve more
[40:37] time
[40:38] there's a way that love acts there's a
[40:40] way that the love of god acts
[40:43] and therefore if it's the love of god
[40:45] that is acting there's a certain thing
[40:47] that it provokes
[40:50] right
[40:50] so i could take the truth and i can
[40:52] minister it with bitterness in my heart
[40:54] and guess what's being sewn with it
[40:57] bitterness
[40:58] and so i i could do things i could act i
[41:00] could do the right thing and what is it
[41:02] we're trying to we try to teach our
[41:03] children to it's not just getting the
[41:04] job done but it's doing it right and
[41:07] with the right attitude
[41:09] and so there's a certain way it says
[41:11] faith which worketh by love so that we
[41:13] could be working all we want with our
[41:15] faith but it's something that works it
[41:16] works by love it's effective it's
[41:18] beneficial it's uh it accomplishes
[41:20] successfully when it's motivated by the
[41:23] right thing so there's things that you
[41:24] could do that in you we could be well
[41:26] meaning
[41:27] and the objective may be right but when
[41:30] it's motivated by love and that's kind
[41:32] of the force that's working behind it
[41:34] then there's a certain way that it acts
[41:36] but then once the act has taken place
[41:39] there's a certain thing that it provokes
[41:42] and so you could say this that the devil
[41:44] will stand there to misrepresent the
[41:47] acts of love to reinterpret them to you
[41:49] so that it provokes the wrong emotions
[41:51] inside of you or we all we have to have
[41:53] the discernment to recognize that though
[41:56] true
[41:57] it's done in the wrong spirit and that's
[41:59] why you feel you feel yourself not
[42:01] agreeing with
[42:03] uh maybe i'm giving some people just
[42:04] loading them up with a tremendous excuse
[42:06] no you just didn't do it in love brother
[42:07] aaron like
[42:09] okay sorry i came on too strong but
[42:11] there's a way that you recognize i it's
[42:13] i'm not being provoked
[42:15] by this action i'm not being provoked in
[42:18] the way that i ought to be by this the
[42:21] word of god preached with the love of
[42:23] god ought to provoke you to love the
[42:24] word of god more
[42:27] certainly if you're elect to
[42:28] it and this is a very obvious reference
[42:33] here from the chapter for the church age
[42:34] book
[42:35] brother branham says how can god be
[42:38] justified excuse me
[42:40] well it's this is the question it was
[42:42] related to even the holocaust and
[42:45] god allowing his children to suffer and
[42:47] millions to be slaughtered in
[42:49] and we see god letting
[42:51] people go through difficult things and
[42:53] suffer tragic uh tragedies and
[42:57] sufferings and travesties so this is the
[42:59] question when you see somebody suffer
[43:00] the children of god those the chosen
[43:02] people how can god be just and loving
[43:06] so right
[43:07] and full of love if he stands by and
[43:09] watches his people suffer
[43:12] and he he quotes malachi chapter one
[43:14] verses one to three so he comes back to
[43:15] he says you see
[43:17] they could not figure out god's love
[43:20] so they have a they had a vision of love
[43:23] and it had a figure right
[43:25] i had a certain representation to them
[43:27] he says they could not figure out god's
[43:29] love because they have a figure of it
[43:31] and it's not matching
[43:33] they have a representation of it an
[43:35] image of it and saying wow this is
[43:36] incongruent with what my image is they
[43:39] thought
[43:40] love meant no suffering
[43:43] they thought that love meant a baby with
[43:45] parental care
[43:47] but god said that his love was elective
[43:50] love
[43:51] now that's that's powerful
[43:54] that it's not just this love that is
[43:56] just driven by emotions to where oh oh
[44:00] i don't want you to suffer and in the
[44:02] same sense a parental love that was
[44:04] going to be with the baby that it's
[44:05] you're you are tasked as a parent for a
[44:08] certain time in a child's a baby's life
[44:11] to be the protector
[44:13] absolutely
[44:14] and so you're protecting them from
[44:16] things that are harmful you even have
[44:17] you need to have a particular knowledge
[44:18] to know that at a certain time their
[44:21] body can't even process certain foods
[44:23] it's not that you need to get them used
[44:24] to it it's like the body's not even
[44:25] going to be able to do it so you wait
[44:27] and and you kind of hold back a little
[44:29] bit until they're old enough and you are
[44:31] responsible for being sure that they're
[44:33] not suffering needlessly and you're
[44:35] making sure that they're not you're
[44:36] responding to pains and cries this is
[44:39] part of a parental love this is what a
[44:40] parent ought to do and they think well
[44:42] if god is the ultimate parent then he
[44:44] ought to always be that way
[44:47] he said that it means that no suffering
[44:49] and sometimes this is a real downside to
[44:51] parenting parents don't want their kids
[44:54] to ever suffer
[44:56] and it's necessary come on children it's
[44:59] necessary that my children suffer
[45:02] right and not necessarily by my hand but
[45:05] it's necessary that they they they fail
[45:07] and they endure conflicting emotions and
[45:10] that they uh and that they they go
[45:12] through difficulties and they learn they
[45:14] learn to become more resilient they
[45:15] learn that things don't always work out
[45:17] and they can't always get what they want
[45:18] and and it's very important to have that
[45:20] balance to let your children suffer so
[45:24] there's a misrepresentation that even
[45:25] scales all the way down to parenting
[45:28] so oh well this is what a real parent
[45:30] would do this is what we have to do we
[45:31] have to protect and we ought to do this
[45:33] and we have to yield and we have to give
[45:34] that's not how parenting works
[45:37] but there is a failure love
[45:40] which is the kind of the love that's
[45:41] being described here they had
[45:43] they couldn't figure out god's love
[45:44] because they had their figure of filial
[45:46] love and in their ideophilia love why
[45:48] would you let someone suffer needlessly
[45:49] and ideophilia love i would love a baby
[45:52] and and i would care for it but he's
[45:53] saying no that's not how god's love
[45:54] works god's love is elective love keep
[45:57] that phrase in mind elective love
[46:00] filial love is the human love
[46:02] it's a different word that's used in the
[46:04] new testament the greek word filio it's
[46:06] of mere personal affection or passion if
[46:08] you have a filial love you can you can
[46:10] have a feeling of love for a burrito
[46:12] all right you can have that it's just a
[46:14] personal affection
[46:16] and there's no intelligence
[46:19] and uh that's what we're wanting to be
[46:21] on the ballot
[46:22] uh in the midterms is to be able to
[46:24] marry a burrito
[46:28] but it's uh it's just personal passion
[46:31] and what's interesting about the word
[46:33] you study the word there's no
[46:34] intelligence associated with it
[46:37] no no no higher intelligence no high
[46:39] purpose it doesn't have to you there
[46:41] doesn't have to be some sort of great uh
[46:44] objective and there doesn't have to be
[46:46] some meaning behind it you say well why
[46:48] do you love that i just do
[46:50] you so there's some people that engage
[46:52] in certain activities and they don't
[46:53] necessarily derive any benefit from it
[46:56] it's just something they enjoy doing so
[46:58] there doesn't have to be any purpose or
[47:00] no high higher purpose involved when
[47:02] it's just filial love but agape love
[47:04] they call the love of intelligence
[47:07] or an intelligent love it's a love which
[47:09] is
[47:10] has comprehension
[47:12] this agape love it's it's joined with
[47:14] the corresponding purpose it's a love of
[47:16] intelligence in reason not that you love
[47:19] intelligence but it's something that has
[47:20] reason and comprehension when you love
[47:22] something it's not because that you're
[47:24] unfamiliar with it you love it through
[47:26] knowledge you love it through
[47:27] understanding as we say about him to
[47:29] know the lord to know christ to truly
[47:31] know him is to love him and the more
[47:33] that we know of his love for us we love
[47:35] him in return because that's what agape
[47:37] love does it's joined with a purpose
[47:40] that this kind of love is is coupled
[47:43] with a kind of a corresponding higher
[47:46] intelligence higher purpose a higher
[47:48] meaning
[47:49] and so this agape love is vastly higher
[47:52] and greater than a human love
[47:55] because it's governed by a higher
[47:56] conscience
[47:58] when we say we love oh i love that and i
[48:00] enjoy this and i really like that and we
[48:02] use those terminologies that that's not
[48:04] necessarily governed by a higher purpose
[48:05] but the love of god is subject to and
[48:08] governed by a higher intelligence and
[48:10] higher reasoning but the man said love
[48:12] is elective that means love
[48:14] well let me say it this way love is
[48:15] deliberate
[48:18] it's very intentional
[48:20] and therefore the love of god can only
[48:22] act to to only act in a way that
[48:25] furthers the divine purpose
[48:28] the love of god can only act in a way to
[48:30] fulfill divine purpose
[48:32] so when when god is acting which god is
[48:35] love when he's doing something he's
[48:36] furthering his objective his own divine
[48:39] objective so it's not just for the sake
[48:41] of love alone but love works to fulfill
[48:44] the word of god
[48:47] brother branham says in one place i
[48:48] don't have these for you but just quick
[48:50] sniffers he says now you take the filial
[48:52] love when we have that love a mother for
[48:55] her baby
[48:56] will drive her right straight to a
[48:58] flaming fire to save that baby's life
[49:00] it's appropriate correct
[49:02] it'll make a man for his sweetheart lay
[49:04] down his life any time
[49:06] that's what filial level do
[49:08] now for someone for a man to sacrifice
[49:11] himself for his family's sake he's
[49:12] saying that's filial level do that
[49:15] um the love that would drive a woman
[49:17] into uh
[49:18] into a burning house to save a child
[49:20] filio love will do that and those are
[49:22] very positive
[49:24] emotions and feelings
[49:25] but it also it also causes a man to do
[49:27] what
[49:28] kill another man
[49:32] love will also motivate someone to take
[49:34] another man's life for the sake of love
[49:38] for the sake of passion so feel your
[49:40] love is a force it's a motivator
[49:42] something that causes somebody to do
[49:44] something
[49:45] but then brother brad i mean i i'm very
[49:47] glad that i'd had this here maybe had
[49:49] lost sight of it for a moment but
[49:50] brother branham when he's talking about
[49:52] compassion of christ
[49:53] and the love of jesus christ and he
[49:55] gives the example how he went to the
[49:56] pool of bethesda and walked right by all
[49:58] these people that were sick
[50:00] went right up to one man who wasn't as
[50:02] sick as everybody else
[50:04] and healed him
[50:05] and he's talking about how people don't
[50:07] understand compassion
[50:09] and he said compassion is to do the will
[50:10] of god and he says in one place but
[50:13] loves referring to agape love is to do
[50:16] the will of him that sends you
[50:19] so immediately we can't we we cannot use
[50:22] love the love of god my love for god
[50:25] and the love of god should have brought
[50:27] in my heart for everyone let's just all
[50:28] hold hands and sing kumbaya or michael
[50:30] row your boat ashore whatever you can do
[50:32] in g
[50:33] and let's do this that's not necessarily
[50:35] what the love of god looks like
[50:37] right
[50:39] the love of god is to do the will of him
[50:41] that sends you
[50:43] that's what love is
[50:45] love is a force love is a motivator in a
[50:48] in a filial context but it also is in
[50:50] the agape context but only to accomplish
[50:53] god's will only to serve god's purpose
[50:56] love has limits then
[50:59] in second corinthians chapter 5 verses
[51:00] 13 to 15.
[51:08] i i i guess i would like maybe just just
[51:10] to stop here because it joins to
[51:12] something else but maybe what we'll do
[51:14] is
[51:15] uh next sunday go we'll start again at
[51:17] this point
[51:19] here and i'll just go further so those
[51:21] of you who thought the super bowl was at
[51:23] noon and i was wrapping this up it's
[51:25] much later i believe
[51:27] so if you got excited for a moment now
[51:29] your hopes are dashed don't worry
[51:31] you should make
[51:34] kickoff as a matter of fact you could
[51:36] probably drive and make it there time by
[51:38] time and close because it's in la la so
[51:40] i think you you're all good got the car
[51:42] all fueled up and ready and you got your
[51:44] big foam finger
[51:46] go cardinals
[51:48] it says in ii corinthians chapter 5
[51:50] verses 13 to 15. for whether we be
[51:53] beside ourselves it is to god or whether
[51:56] we be sober it is for your cause
[51:58] certainly in the context of paul you're
[52:00] mad well it's for god it's to god
[52:02] crazy for christ and whether we be sober
[52:04] it is for your cause
[52:07] for the love of christ constraineth us
[52:11] notice now
[52:13] constraining how limit it means to hold
[52:15] together lest it fall to pieces
[52:18] the the the the love of christ is
[52:20] holding me it presses in on every side
[52:22] it means to hold completely and the way
[52:24] paul's using this notice how you're
[52:25] saying the love of christ is holding me
[52:27] back the love of jesus christ the love
[52:29] of christ in my heart the love for
[52:30] christ the love for you constrainteth us
[52:33] because we thus judge that if we one
[52:35] died for all then we're all dead and
[52:37] that he died for all that they which
[52:40] live should not henceforth live unto
[52:42] themselves but unto him which died for
[52:43] them and rose again paul was saying that
[52:46] this love hol this love holds him back
[52:50] because he had to act in a manner that
[52:52] was consistent with the word he says the
[52:53] love of christ constrainted us and he
[52:56] says because one we can we judge that if
[52:58] one died for all then we're all dead and
[53:00] he died for all that they which should
[53:01] that live now don't just live to
[53:03] themselves but live unto him
[53:05] the one that died and rose again paul
[53:07] was saying that love actually held him
[53:09] back and kept him from acting maybe you
[53:11] could say in this sense that they
[53:12] thought well paul if he really loved us
[53:14] you would have done this and paul if you
[53:16] really loved us you would have done that
[53:17] paul's saying i do and this love
[53:19] constrains me
[53:22] this love keeps me from acting
[53:25] maybe in the way that you think i ought
[53:27] to act
[53:28] says that they which live should not
[53:30] live henceforth unto themselves
[53:33] in philippians chapter 2 verse 21 he
[53:35] says for all seek their own
[53:37] not the things which are jesus christ
[53:40] this is the problem he's identifying
[53:42] that people motivated by their own
[53:43] passions their own desires their needs
[53:44] their own wants that they're driven to
[53:47] do certain things but they're just
[53:48] seeking their own
[53:50] that even though it might have certain
[53:52] platitudes and the pretense of sincerity
[53:54] and sacrifice when you get when you get
[53:57] down to it you have to recognize there
[53:58] was something in it for them
[54:00] and do we not should we not all be aware
[54:02] of that when it comes to
[54:04] uh the our
[54:06] interactions in the world especially in
[54:08] business
[54:09] that nobody's in the business of
[54:10] altruism
[54:14] not even goodwill
[54:17] that's a for-profit thing i mean they
[54:19] they're taking your junk and i'm glad to
[54:21] give it to them but they're not turning
[54:23] around and giving it to people who need
[54:24] it they're turning around and selling it
[54:26] right actually their goodwill no
[54:29] it's it that's just to get you in the
[54:31] door to give your stuff up oh it's for
[54:32] charity i get a ditch no no there's a
[54:34] it's it's motivated by profit now if
[54:36] i've got some of the particulars not
[54:38] worked out quite right just straighten
[54:39] me up on it but my point is this our
[54:41] interactions day to day and someone's
[54:43] asking for something or they want to
[54:45] give you something if anybody wants to
[54:47] give you something it's fine to be like
[54:49] all right
[54:50] i think i know what's in it for me but
[54:52] what's in it for you
[54:54] or where are you gonna get me
[54:56] i appreciate everybody's prayers i got a
[54:58] car this week within 24 hours of telling
[55:00] the church everybody prayed i got a car
[55:02] look i don't care how much this guy
[55:04] tells me i ripped him off and i and i
[55:06] beat him down and got the best price
[55:08] and and i won i know he took me too
[55:12] hey i just bought a used car
[55:15] you don't leave a used car dealerships
[55:16] and yeah i really showed him if you
[55:18] think that they're laughing about you in
[55:21] the break room
[55:23] why because they're not in the business
[55:25] of making sure everyone has a car
[55:27] i mean mr mcgeary
[55:29] i'm not in this for the money i'm in
[55:31] this to see that good people like you
[55:34] can afford a good car
[55:36] and i know times are tough he didn't do
[55:38] that but we don't need the people are in
[55:40] it for themselves he says all seek their
[55:43] own not the things which are jesus
[55:45] christ and that's the beauty that's the
[55:47] beauty of
[55:49] of having the love of god in your heart
[55:50] it says it doesn't seek its own it's
[55:52] seeking a higher purpose is seeking a
[55:54] higher objective and not not misguided
[55:57] to think oh if you love somebody you'll
[55:59] do this for them well think again
[56:01] if you do that and maybe it makes them
[56:03] happy and helps them out but would it
[56:05] further the will of god in their life or
[56:08] become a barrier to god dealing with
[56:10] them
[56:11] would it become a barrier to them
[56:13] recognizing a need would it become a
[56:14] barrier to them fulfilling the the
[56:16] objective of christ in life you love
[56:18] operates by different parameters than
[56:20] the love that we have in our heart
[56:21] called filio
[56:23] i love it how he just says love of
[56:25] christ constrainteth us it just it
[56:26] created this image of being held back
[56:28] that love actually holds back because
[56:31] love itself is bound
[56:33] love is wrapped up and bound in the
[56:35] character of jesus christ love itself
[56:38] was embodied in the person jesus christ
[56:42] and brother branham is talking about the
[56:43] love of god
[56:45] and the the love of god being shed
[56:47] abroad in the apostles hearts i believe
[56:49] it was he says that love in their hearts
[56:50] was god's love for his own
[56:53] so the love that was in the hearts of
[56:55] the disciples was the love that god had
[56:57] for his own it's the same love
[57:01] therefore love has to act
[57:03] consistent with the nature of god
[57:08] god has boundaries
[57:10] see what i did there
[57:12] love actually consistent with the nature
[57:14] of god and it is in god's nature to to
[57:17] hold himself to his word
[57:20] god who feels all time and space
[57:22] limitless unending eternal omnipotent
[57:25] all-powerful
[57:26] formed himself into an image
[57:29] so he can begin to create confined
[57:30] himself to creation holds himself within
[57:33] a universe which he expands beyond it
[57:35] but god puts himself in a box so that we
[57:37] could know him
[57:38] so i don't ever want to put god in a box
[57:40] but if god put himself in his word so
[57:42] that i could know him then i don't want
[57:44] to break him outside of this to find him
[57:48] oh well you could just find him in
[57:49] nature you can find him in any religion
[57:51] and you could just find him in sincerity
[57:52] and just find him in good people okay
[57:54] all right
[57:55] i i feel ya i know what you're trying to
[57:57] say but god said this is where you'll
[57:59] know me
[58:01] i may be everywhere but if you want to
[58:02] know me this is where you're going to
[58:04] know me
[58:04] so he's a god of boundaries the god of
[58:06] order he's a god who's very controlled
[58:10] elective love is selective love
[58:14] it is discriminate
[58:16] it's very precise
[58:19] it's calculating
[58:21] but yet it's sincere
[58:24] just to kind of touch on it just briefly
[58:28] it says love does not behave itself
[58:31] unseemly in other words it does not
[58:32] behave indecently
[58:35] love is not rude
[58:38] love is never intentionally offensive
[58:43] to anyone
[58:46] but love is respectful
[58:50] to say that love does not behave
[58:53] indecently
[58:55] that means it will give to anyone their
[58:57] due it gives to anyone what their due
[58:59] suitable to the time the person the
[59:01] circumstance
[59:02] and
[59:03] that they're in
[59:05] if this is what someone is do if this is
[59:07] what someone deserves if this is what
[59:09] someone ought to have it will not
[59:10] withhold it
[59:13] does not it never behaves itself
[59:15] indecently
[59:17] love has limits
[59:19] you can't say well it's love but it's
[59:21] indecent you can't say it's love but it
[59:23] does not render what's due and what's
[59:24] right you cannot say it's love but it's
[59:26] intentionally offensive love in itself
[59:29] once you truly know it
[59:31] is an offense just in its true nature it
[59:33] doesn't need to intentionally be
[59:35] disrespectful
[59:38] i'm going to invite the musicians to
[59:40] come or just make ready to come and i
[59:41] want to close
[59:42] with the statement
[59:44] from trying to do god a service without
[59:46] it being
[59:47] god's will
[59:53] to maybe have
[59:55] good intentions and be well-meaning but
[59:57] be poorly
[59:58] led to feel that you have something
[1:00:01] motivating you something driving you but
[1:00:03] then once you look at it
[1:00:05] you're trying to accomplish it and even
[1:00:07] saying well look at what i'm trying to
[1:00:08] accomplish look what i'm trying to
[1:00:09] accomplish but
[1:00:10] it's not his will
[1:00:18] and if you want to read or listen to
[1:00:20] some of these services that he touches
[1:00:22] on this this is one in november 27th
[1:00:25] 1965 i think it's at a shreveport
[1:00:28] brother men's breakfast
[1:00:30] he says no matter how much your
[1:00:31] anointing is he's talking about you
[1:00:34] brothers you sisters who think you're
[1:00:35] called to preach he says no matter how
[1:00:36] much your anointing is you've got to get
[1:00:38] in god's provided position
[1:00:42] it's not just anointing but it's
[1:00:43] position
[1:00:45] and he's using the example of david
[1:00:47] bringing back the ark and putting it on
[1:00:48] an ox card
[1:00:50] and if we all found out the ark of the
[1:00:53] covenant was being restored back to
[1:00:55] israel there'd be a shout
[1:00:58] there'd be rejoicing
[1:01:00] you say well it's coming back it belongs
[1:01:01] it's ours right it belongs to us
[1:01:04] well then just get it back
[1:01:07] it doesn't matter how you get it it just
[1:01:08] matters that it's there even you could
[1:01:10] take this as well you just need to get
[1:01:11] in position well by any means necessary
[1:01:13] to get in position i just want to do it
[1:01:15] so i feel like i should be first chair
[1:01:17] piano player so i'm going to get micah
[1:01:18] sick
[1:01:19] and i'm going to tell some lies about
[1:01:20] them because i believe that's what god
[1:01:21] called me to do and by any means
[1:01:23] necessary because i want to be first
[1:01:24] chair
[1:01:25] that's my position
[1:01:27] it doesn't work that way
[1:01:29] so david he says david's anointing's
[1:01:31] right his his objective what he's
[1:01:33] wanting to do is right but he says but
[1:01:35] in doing it he got enthused
[1:01:38] and stepped over the boundary line
[1:01:41] well wait a minute i mean
[1:01:42] the boundary line does not the ark
[1:01:44] belong to israel does not the ark of the
[1:01:45] covenant belong it with israel and isn't
[1:01:48] it not declaring god's presence so
[1:01:50] should it just be a matter of getting it
[1:01:52] back in its place but through enthusiasm
[1:01:54] the wrong kind of emotion the wrong kind
[1:01:56] of inspiration he stepped over the
[1:01:58] boundary line what did he do he stepped
[1:02:00] over the boundary line
[1:02:02] when i was studying this even last year
[1:02:04] on the subject of barriers and
[1:02:05] boundaries and reading every place
[1:02:07] brother brown said boundary
[1:02:09] every place brother bram said barrier
[1:02:11] and boundaries and these things
[1:02:13] this is this this subject matter came up
[1:02:15] quite frequently where broadband talks
[1:02:17] about stepping over something
[1:02:19] instead of putting the ark in its
[1:02:21] original position he carried it on a new
[1:02:23] cart
[1:02:24] and not over the hearts of the levites
[1:02:27] it was supposed to be carried on the
[1:02:28] shoulder of the levites which is over
[1:02:30] the heart
[1:02:31] the word is not in the mind it's in the
[1:02:33] heart
[1:02:35] the word's not in your head
[1:02:36] it's in your heart not a new on a new
[1:02:39] cart what was that the cart he's saying
[1:02:41] is represented something new david did
[1:02:43] there spoke of every denomination
[1:02:45] there'd ever be thanks david
[1:02:48] he speaks of it right there in that act
[1:02:51] the ark of the covenant the word of god
[1:02:52] the presence of god this is it this is
[1:02:54] what it's all about this is what it's
[1:02:55] for but he says in that simple act he
[1:02:57] spoke of and signaled every he told us
[1:03:01] what every denomination would do from
[1:03:03] that moment on
[1:03:04] this is a characteristic in the mark of
[1:03:05] what denominations do it may be the word
[1:03:07] it may be the presence it may be the
[1:03:09] things that relate to god and it may
[1:03:11] your objective may be right and what
[1:03:13] you're trying to accomplish may be right
[1:03:14] but he's saying it's not according to
[1:03:16] the will of god
[1:03:17] remember if you're going to try to find
[1:03:18] out whether or not you're doing
[1:03:20] you're right whether or not something's
[1:03:22] right he says you check your mode and
[1:03:24] objective but check the word first too
[1:03:27] it's like i want to kill my neighbor
[1:03:29] because he smokes and it's just coming
[1:03:31] right over the fence and i think my kids
[1:03:32] are wanting to start they're going to
[1:03:34] want to start smoking
[1:03:35] and and you know he's done this and he's
[1:03:37] a bad person and so you start you're
[1:03:38] like yeah this is a really good argument
[1:03:40] but can we back up
[1:03:42] like what you're wanting to do
[1:03:44] regardless of what your reasons are it's
[1:03:46] contrary to the word
[1:03:48] and if that's not good enough it's
[1:03:49] illegal buddy you can't do that
[1:03:53] he stepped over a boundary line now he's
[1:03:54] saying the word is in the heart
[1:03:56] not in the mind denominations are
[1:03:59] represented here god's word is not to be
[1:04:01] carried by state presbyters or bishops
[1:04:03] and so forth of denominations
[1:04:10] and i know there's a
[1:04:16] i'll say this i feel that i don't need
[1:04:18] to defend preaching
[1:04:19] overtly i just do it
[1:04:22] right so you could be safe knowing that
[1:04:24] i'm not a hypocrite up here just
[1:04:26] preaching
[1:04:27] i believe in it
[1:04:30] but in the defense of it sometimes what
[1:04:31] happens
[1:04:33] and just go so far
[1:04:35] but notice where brother branham brings
[1:04:36] this balance in it
[1:04:38] the holy ghost the word is not to be
[1:04:39] carried by state presbyters or bishops
[1:04:41] uh uh so forth of denominations
[1:04:44] it's the baptismal holy ghost in the
[1:04:45] heart of man not in some ecclesiastical
[1:04:48] movement we say oh yes the heart of man
[1:04:49] the levites yes there's a great
[1:04:51] beautiful type there's a beautiful image
[1:04:52] that the word being carried by the
[1:04:54] levites the ministry but he says the
[1:04:55] holy spirit is a treasure of god's love
[1:04:58] in the heart of man and women to obey
[1:05:02] this word is a treasure the holy spirit
[1:05:04] is a treasure of god's love
[1:05:07] in your heart
[1:05:09] man or woman boy or girl the holy spirit
[1:05:12] once you've received this blessed gift
[1:05:14] it's a treasure of god's love in the
[1:05:16] heart of man and a woman to obey
[1:05:19] now this is where i'm gonna stop but and
[1:05:21] i'm gonna stop short of where i wanted
[1:05:23] to uh
[1:05:24] originally envisioned of being
[1:05:27] but just to see how now love is gonna
[1:05:29] act what it is and what it does
[1:05:32] and then the holy spirit the word of god
[1:05:34] is to be carried into your heart it's a
[1:05:36] treasure of god's love in the heart of
[1:05:37] man
[1:05:38] satan chose your mind god chose your
[1:05:40] heart the love of god is first concerned
[1:05:43] with your heart
[1:05:44] the love of god is first concerned about
[1:05:46] the condition of your spirit the love of
[1:05:48] god is not oh it's in my heart now
[1:05:50] anything goes just open yourself up to
[1:05:52] it and get beat up and keep be battered
[1:05:54] the love of god is first to your heart
[1:05:56] the love god is first to your spirit and
[1:05:59] the love of god is now doing battle for
[1:06:01] your mind
[1:06:04] it's concerned about those things
[1:06:06] and so the bible says in proverbs 4
[1:06:08] because remember the word is not in the
[1:06:09] mind it's in the heart
[1:06:11] something about your person about who
[1:06:12] you are in proverbs 4 23. i'm going to
[1:06:14] read this i'm just going to leave it
[1:06:16] with you keep thy heart with all
[1:06:17] diligence
[1:06:19] proud of it are the issues of life
[1:06:22] you must keep your heart you must guard
[1:06:23] your heart you must protect your heart
[1:06:25] why because out of it are the issues of
[1:06:27] life and it's from there that the words
[1:06:28] need to be expressed
[1:06:30] you have the you have by the baptist you
[1:06:33] have the word of god in your
[1:06:34] soul
[1:06:36] but where does it emit to
[1:06:38] and how is it expressed
[1:06:42] listen we don't go
[1:06:43] well you want to see jesus
[1:06:45] peer into my soul
[1:06:48] right you're not gonna be able to see it
[1:06:50] he's gonna know it by my spirit
[1:06:52] he's gonna know about how this body acts
[1:06:55] so there's a there's the love of god in
[1:06:57] our soul now it's emitting
[1:07:00] it's manifesting
[1:07:02] expressing itself out
[1:07:06] and love then says keep thy heart the
[1:07:08] heart that place
[1:07:10] it's even it's the thing from which we
[1:07:11] love humanly
[1:07:14] it instinctively it is instinctively
[1:07:17] protective of god's purpose
[1:07:21] and god's will
[1:07:22] remember how brother man said oh how do
[1:07:24] i
[1:07:25] god is not the author of frustration but
[1:07:27] of peace
[1:07:30] and his will is that after we have
[1:07:31] suffered
[1:07:32] he's perfected us establish us
[1:07:34] strengthen us
[1:07:36] because god's love is
[1:07:38] intensely intensely protective
[1:07:41] of his purpose
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:46] and i have had some other scriptures to
[1:07:48] share
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:50] and i i don't i don't want to be lengthy
[1:07:53] so
[1:07:54] in the nature and the characteristic of
[1:07:56] love love is
[1:07:58] protective of god's purpose
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:02] i would love to emphasize how that love
[1:08:04] then does not manipulate
[1:08:06] we said i'll put my spirit in you and
[1:08:09] will cause you
[1:08:10] cause you to walk after my statutes it's
[1:08:13] that's not manipulation
[1:08:16] that that's that's an affinity that's
[1:08:18] the growth that's that's the instinct of
[1:08:20] love this is a this is something
[1:08:21] transfined where there's been an
[1:08:23] attraction there's been something that's
[1:08:24] taken place in your heart to where it's
[1:08:27] something that motivates you and drives
[1:08:28] you something that you want to do that
[1:08:30] what's the love of god to keep his
[1:08:32] commandments and his commandments are
[1:08:33] not grievous
[1:08:35] so it's now i better do this i'm going
[1:08:37] to go to hell or i'm being forced to
[1:08:38] this and be controlled to do this the
[1:08:40] love of god does not manipulate nor can
[1:08:43] the love of god be manipulated
[1:08:48] so therefore you cannot let your the
[1:08:51] love you have for god
[1:08:52] you cannot put that and make it subject
[1:08:55] to the whims of man subject to the whims
[1:08:57] of emotions subject to the whims of
[1:08:59] family subject to the whims of people
[1:09:01] who would manipulate you and abuse you
[1:09:03] the love of god will not be manipulated
[1:09:07] love is not pushy
[1:09:10] right love is not pushy it doesn't
[1:09:12] pressure doesn't coerce doesn't force
[1:09:15] but it's also not a pushover
[1:09:17] and i know i'm repeating myself you said
[1:09:19] brother you should say the same thing
[1:09:20] but you're just using different
[1:09:21] terminology
[1:09:22] so then is it the same thing if it's
[1:09:24] different words
[1:09:27] love is not pushy
[1:09:29] but it's also not a pushover it can be
[1:09:31] easily coerced because love has limits
[1:09:36] and it was a dangerous phrase that we
[1:09:38] use sometimes well if you loved me you
[1:09:40] wouldn't do that
[1:09:42] that in itself is manipulative
[1:09:45] because it first implies because you did
[1:09:47] that
[1:09:48] proves you don't love me
[1:09:51] and love is not
[1:09:53] cannot be manipulated because when you
[1:09:55] do that you think you're actually
[1:09:56] coaxing love out of the person
[1:09:59] right you didn't think you'd get real at
[1:10:00] that moment did you are you are you
[1:10:03] coaxing something out when you say that
[1:10:04] is it provoking love what is it defense
[1:10:07] defensive
[1:10:08] then the argument becomes about the fact
[1:10:10] that you don't think i love you
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:13] and that's how that's how we have to be
[1:10:15] so
[1:10:16] honest with ourselves
[1:10:18] that love will not manipulate but then
[1:10:20] this love that we have for god's word
[1:10:22] cannot be manipulated either
[1:10:25] and to never let the devil take that and
[1:10:27] manipulate it
[1:10:28] to cause us to do things that a
[1:10:29] christian should not do
[1:10:31] love has limits
[1:10:33] could we stand this morning
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:48] amen
[1:10:50] could you bow your heads together with
[1:10:51] me if you have a need a special need
[1:10:53] today
[1:10:54] i just invite you to lift your hand
[1:10:57] i know it's unspoken
[1:10:59] if you buy rays in your hand but that is
[1:11:01] an act of faith to signify lord this is
[1:11:03] my need this is my prayer
[1:11:05] a gracious heavenly father with lifted
[1:11:07] hands across
[1:11:09] from the front to the back and side to
[1:11:11] side all over there's hands that are
[1:11:12] being raised
[1:11:14] and it is an act of faith to say lord
[1:11:16] you know my thought
[1:11:20] that is represented by a raised palm
[1:11:23] you know the need that is signified by a
[1:11:26] lifted hand
[1:11:28] only you know
[1:11:30] lord is mortal man i could look at these
[1:11:31] people and see a hand lift and i say oh
[1:11:34] that brother must be praying about that
[1:11:35] job interview and oh that sister's
[1:11:37] praying about her son
[1:11:39] oh this person's praying about
[1:11:41] the they're they've been sick or they
[1:11:43] have a problem that hasn't been riveted
[1:11:45] in the flesh i could have all sorts of
[1:11:46] guesses because i know them personally
[1:11:49] but you lord know the deepest secrets of
[1:11:51] our
[1:11:52] heart and i'm so grateful that we can
[1:11:55] trust you
[1:11:57] that we have lived lives professing love
[1:12:00] and loving and receiving love and have
[1:12:02] experienced great harms and betrayals
[1:12:05] and hurts
[1:12:07] that often causes us to be reluctant to
[1:12:10] love and to question love but i'm so
[1:12:12] glad to know
[1:12:14] i can trust your love
[1:12:17] that though we as humans may preach
[1:12:20] the gospel of psychological place of
[1:12:22] safety and failed to even practice what
[1:12:24] we preach we know that with you we are
[1:12:26] safe
[1:12:28] that with you lord with you
[1:12:31] we can trust you
[1:12:34] father i pray that you knowing our
[1:12:36] thoughts and knowing our needs and
[1:12:37] knowing our hearts right now could just
[1:12:38] make yourself known in a very personal
[1:12:40] way to those that have been here today
[1:12:42] to hear
[1:12:43] these things
[1:12:45] that as i have lord intentionally
[1:12:49] used
[1:12:50] trusting that it's not offensive lord
[1:12:52] but trusting that this believing that
[1:12:54] this title love has limits is
[1:12:55] thought-provoking
[1:12:58] may there be a willingness to consider
[1:13:03] that your love
[1:13:05] has
[1:13:06] deliberately chosen to express itself in
[1:13:09] a very specific way
[1:13:13] and that if we are going to experience
[1:13:15] your love
[1:13:16] we cannot make certain arguments or
[1:13:19] claims about you that are not true
[1:13:22] because then lord we're only enthused
[1:13:23] we're only excited
[1:13:25] and immediately we step across a
[1:13:27] boundary line into judgment
[1:13:29] we step across a boundary line that
[1:13:31] causes death and
[1:13:33] dissimulation and
[1:13:36] a loss of courage lord
[1:13:39] lord we draw from the example that your
[1:13:41] prophet pointed out and trying to do god
[1:13:42] a service without it being your
[1:13:44] will
[1:13:46] that lord we want to stay within the
[1:13:48] center of your will and whatever it is
[1:13:50] we say and do whatever it is we want to
[1:13:52] accomplish whatever it is we want to
[1:13:53] achieve
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:55] what i pray now that you would touch us
[1:13:58] in our minds and in our hearts
[1:14:00] strengthen us and encourage us
[1:14:03] and bless your people
[1:14:05] and grant
[1:14:06] an anointing a touch a quickening for
[1:14:08] those hands that were raised
[1:14:10] you could declare your love to them
[1:14:12] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:14:13] pray amen
