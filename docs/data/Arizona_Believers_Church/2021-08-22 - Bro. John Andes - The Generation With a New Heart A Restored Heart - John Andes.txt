TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen Ezekiel 37 as the Lord is now just going to speak to you personally verse 1 the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the Phoenix Valley why not I mean do y'all want me to preach way up in the clouds or you want to come right down where we're living amen so now Ezekiel was carried away by the spirit and looked down into the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley of Phoenix the Phoenix Valley and lo they were very dry don't worry I'm not adding to the word I'm just bringing you into and he said unto me son of man can these bones live because bones speak of life or a person that used to be walking and living and vibrant but now I just see a bunch of Bones and from the youngest to the oldest that's kind of scary to see a bunch of bones but the answer was can these bones live that was the question and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest again he said unto me unto Ezekiel prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus sayeth the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live hello Valley of Phoenix Hallelujah hello to you Believers that might have had a life of dry bones the spirit of the Lord is here today the Lord is here in this room right now to Speak Life to you and there might be a question can you live again I'm here to answer back you can live again you say but I'm just a bunch of Bones no you're not I see you walking I see you living I see you restored I see you recovered I see you coming out of the bed what a vision and he spoke to the bones and said ye shall live and verse six I will lay Senus upon you and will bring up flesh upon you this is God speaking and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord so it's not the preacher it's not the Deacon it's not somebody else it's the Lord speaking these things so I prophesied Ezekiel said as I was commanded and as I prophesied or as I spoke the word over the bones there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone Hallelujah and when I beheld lo the Senus and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above and there but there was no breath in them it's kind of like um a person you'd go visit in the hospital or a person that would be laying there in distress they have skin they have flesh they they're not just bones but there was no breath or life or spirit in them then said he unto me aren't you glad God didn't stop there he said prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayeth the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon the SL that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them Hallelujah and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army praise God now verse 11 and he said unto me son of man these bones he's explaining now the vision these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God behold all my oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord hallelujah when I have open opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves last verse verse 14 and shall put my spirit let's all say my spirit my come up out of that graveyard come up out of that dead church that dead situation that dead Health God is not going to leave you comfortless by the road just wounded he's going to pour in oil he's going to pour in wine he's speaking I am the Lord and I've opened your Graves verse 14 and I will put my spirit in you and ye shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall you know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord Hallelujah Lord fulfill that today this day the scripture is fulfilled I'm standing in a room not of dry bones but of people of the Believers of this message that are having a Revival you are being restored you say what are you doing here in Phoenix I'm being restored I'm coming up out of my bed God bless you you can have your seats if you're able Hallelujah isn't it great to be part of a message that's alive I don't believe I'm speaking to a valley of dry bones I believe I'm speaking to men and women that just are wanting to see God move in our midst and I'm not brother Aaron McGary I'm brother John Andy so forgive me I'm just the spare tire but you know when you need the spare tire you don't want to go open up the back of your trunk and it's all flat is that right nothing big been being way out near Lake Pleasant or way up in Wickenberg somewhere and and you and you have a flat tire and you open up your trunk and the tire the spare tire is flat it's like God don't give us a flat service amen we we've come on a Sunday morning we're looking forward to it we're under expectation I I believe God's doing something here in this assembly of Arizona Believers Fellowship and you're part of it and I'm part of it Hallelujah so don't let me down amen we're we've come here to be part of a Believers that are going on with God and so I salute you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ now in our next slide as we look at this thought I have some slides to show you today I hope that's okay in the restored heart brother brandham was speaking this was actually um s sister Nicole the next day after spoken word is the Original Seed we were talking about this yesterday on our hike and brother brandham spoke spoken word is the Original Seed and then the very next day he spoke in time sign seed and he said when we see God heal a man here a few days ago in our church they brought a little girl in there on a stretcher and they called me in the nighttime on the road and said said the girl cannot live the cancer was so bad about 17 years old she can't even get there she's going to die before she uh gets there it was a pitiful case a lovely little girl of 17 years old but he said to prove something to my church I never touched the girl the child at all I never as much as touched her I walked in she was laying on a stretcher of course there was other sick people but I was concerned about the child to catch her spirit when I spoke to her and it seemed like a very fine little girl I see no reason why that child should fill a premature grave and that has to be the devil trying to take her life now can we all agree that Satan's trying to take our lives today and the Holy Spirit walks in the great physician walks in and but he's just watching and looking at your spirit he's trying to catch our spirit and this this young lady she was a fine person and it was the devil trying to take her life so I never touched the child at all I went right to the pulpit with the word and stayed right with the word and the word healed her so instantly until she got up and walked away is all right now let living like anybody else just let brother uh Alderson take care of the stretcher don't worry about the stretcher she's healed she's out there giving testimony and fellowshipping brother Emanuel take care of the the stretcher bed all right you just focus on the healing you focus on letting the tumor drop down in the chair next to you and let it just wither up and dry that old spirit that has haunted you the Lord Jesus said it's over now speak to this valley of dry bones and breathe life breathe strength back into them breathe hope back in into the situation and so now we find a young lady that is walking and right and living like nobody else and can't find a trace of it but brother brandham if you notice he said I was trying to prove something to my church that it's just not all physical and laying hands he said I never even touched her next slide see the word went forth and she believed the word and the word is God's life and power and the word is what does it the word heals the sick when you say well Jesus healed the sick he is the word he is the word when you receive the word you receive Jesus for he is the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we believe that don't we we believe that Christ is God's word made manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head now the body of Jesus Christ is not the sickest body on the face of the Earth this morning I believe we're getting ready for a Rapture I believe brother brandham made those statements in the 60s but God has restored and brought a a generation we're standing up on our feet today we might be a little bit wobbly we might have to hold one another up we might have to be dragging people across the finish line by love but we're going to make it speak to this valley of dry bones and don't talk about the bones or the dryness or the politics or the covid just preach the word just breathe life and and and we want to see breath and life back into the church that's what we're looking for not a form of godliness with your dress or your long hair we not our goal isn't to get all our children sitting nice and not saying a word it's but to have breath it's to have life it's to have strength back into them and that's what we are believing for today with all of our hearts now in the next slide and I know this is going to be difficult for maybe some in the back to read uh in the next slide this is out of the church age book when brother brandham is quoting Revelations 10 and then Matthew and then Malachi chter 4 I I quoted this on Wednesday night Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse today we're speaking on the restored heart so we were taking out of Malachi 4 and the next paragraph brother brandham talked about how in Malachi 46 how that uh he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers and then he began to speak about the hearts of the fathers to the children and he says when Elijah's Ministry was here in John the Baptist he was pointing to that Prophet that was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children but now he's quoting Luke 17 can y'all see that okay and then verse the last paragraph is what I wanted to bring to you this morning again we know that because Jesus said so he just said John in the ministry of John the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children we know that because Jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers that is yet to take place the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this Prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls will prepare the children to welcome back Jesus and I'm looking into your faces today I'm seeing the prophecy being fulfilled you are the children whose hearts are being turned back I mean it's not just him welcoming us home it's you running to him saying I'm coming home I'm coming out of this Valley I'm coming out of this life that I've been living or I'm coming out of this sin of the world I'm arising you're the lazarous that is laying in the Tomb and you hearing your name being called and it's not John or Mary or Sue or Esther Danielle but it's the voice of the word and when you hear that something happens inside of you it's like an energy it's like a force it's like breathe and you receive that breath and it gives you strength to rise in the name of the Lord now in our next slide last year my my son-in-law we have three children and three grandchildren and my son-in-law lives in Canada he married my daughter my youngest daughter and he went into a doctor's office and can you believe it uh this is probably the Canadian healthc care system but posted right on the cabinet brother Judah was this sign very clear and bold letter please limit each office visit to one or two issues only and other words they don't have time for your life story they didn't want to talk about this that your ankle bone your headbone your knee bone and what's going on your back and your cousin and your uncle and then and then and they they wanted to focus in on only one or two that was their time of the day that's their strength that's their answers aren't you glad we're in another office today where he says bring all of your issues you know bring all of your life you say well we got we got 10 minutes brother John no you got eternity God's working on your case he's he's got the file and everything that's happened bring all your issues to the Lord now the world might tell you just you know we'll T we'll deal with one or two issues today and God's saying no bring all your needs bring all your issues and we got them all in importance and this is the main thing and God might just you know you know good deal with number five and you say you know why is he do he might be talking to another person in the body and they're going and they're moving and you're like nothing's happening nothing's happening just wait till the end of the service Hallelujah don't fall asleep today so I'm glad we're not part of this Health Care System the great Physician's in the room and he's like whatever you have need of I'm here to talk to you about it so as we look in the next slide I wanted to bring you back a little bit to Wednesday night when we were speaking out of Ezekiel and about how I will give you a new heart and I will give you a new spirit and I will put my spirit within you which is you you all know that I think brother Aaron's taught you very well Ezekiel and I will give you a new heart I'm going to give you a new spirit and I'm going to give you my spirit that is the holy spirit that is God's spirit coming inside but if you can look on the screen and I don't want don't want anybody fainting on us today I I showed a picture like this in South Carolina and somebody ran ran right out I think they were probably like me they don't like to see blood we're speaking on the heart though and when you have open heart surgery I I just showed you this photo for a reason especially these surgeons that are performing this coronary uh artery bypass surgery when they open up your heart but I want you to notice how they put in those steel retractors because they want to open up the area so that the physician can be focused in and if you notice what's in their hands can you see that doctor they don't have a big sword they don't have a big wide thing but they have a little scalpel can you see that because we're getting down into delicate areas and little fine nerves and blood vessels and parts of a person's life or heart it's not a time to bring in the sludgehammer or the Jackhammer hello like we're in the operating room and and we're talking about things that are maybe and if you just look at these people they're trained and they're focused in on the heart you might not see a foot specialist you might not see your favorite ear specialist at this type of surgery but the heart doctors in and he's been trained he's been there to know how to go in because we the heart is in trouble there's heart trouble here and we need to have the heart of the matter dealt with and not just the little surface you know skin scratch you got from the doggy this morning or you know when you tripped at the at the pool or at the grocery store we're not talking about your just the outside realm we're going into the heart of the matter and sometimes you have to take out the heart and deal with the heart of the matter God knows how to take care of everything in our lives so the restored heart has to do with now opening up the insides and we see in the next slide a prophecy in Joel 2 of I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten you've heard this verse before right I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you this is a promise of God coming to you and saying I am here to restore you from all the things that's happened over the years it could be a long time it could be a measure of time or a certain time of the age of your life where something happened or it could be your whole lifetime it could be like God coming to an individual and saying I'm going to bring back I'm going to restore to you all the years so we're not going to talk about the valley of dry bones and how they got to be dry we're in the operating room and we're going to have the great physician speak to us about how we can get restored or I restore to you the years we'll go to the next slide as I wanted to show you out of two other versions I think some of you are interested sometimes in the King James version here's the new international version of Joel 2 God saying I will restore I will repay you I'm sorry I will repay you for the years that the Locust has eaten the great Locust and the young Locust and the other Locust whatever Locust whatever Spirit has tried to eat away at your fruit or at your fellowship or at your peace or at your joy or at your marriage or at your Faith even in the message or in the messenger or in God here's a promise saying I'm going to repay you for all the years and all the damage that those locusts tried to eat away at you God is saying I am here to pay you back in another version on the bottom you can see then I will make up to you I'm going to make it up to you you say I've bet had a hard hand or I've had a a certain thing going on and I just feel like I'm on the wrong side of everything I'm on the negative side of everything this is the word saying I will make up to you for the years that the swarming Locust has eaten the creeping Locust the stripping Locust and the gnawing Locust my we could take a whole weekend on those things couldn't we oh these creepy and crawly things that try to eat away at your life like a snake they try to eat you you they try to creep on you they're creepers they try to strip you of your they try to strip you of your skin they try to strip you and in the valley of dry bones they had no skin they had no sen you and they had totally been gone to the place where the gnawing Locust had just ate away everything and God spoke to them and said I will restore praise God that should have been a great shout from us saying praise God I am the word that's being restored I am restored in the next slide I wanted you to just eat on on some of this just a little bit these promises because if we're going to get your heart restored it's going to come from the spoken word and brother John isn't here just to lay hands on every person as a minister shake hands with the minister we already heard that at the beginning it's hearing the word he sent his word and I don't know you or what's going on in your life but the Holy Spirit does and when you're in the open heart surgery like I showed you earlier you don't care about the doctor's glasses about his you know coat about whether he's you know whether he's divorced married this I know as a minister we should but I'm I'm talking about a doctor in a natural case where he went to University or I don't like that University where whether you ate you know breakfast this morning or what would you eat for supper last night you're not interested in that you have a heart problem so when we're in the house of God it's looking beyond the Flesh and the secretary and the nurse that took your blood and took your blood pressure you say well I got you know I got muscles here why you taking my M no it's a blood pressure thing oh oh and and then we get all nervous and things about things that as we come into this Hospital place this church building Arizona believer's church is like a hospital room and we like to look all dressed and niced up and ironed and all good for Sunday morning and God says I'm looking at a surgery room I'm looking at a hospital room I'm looking at you walking in troubled and walking out healed and praising God and being restored hearing something that can give you faith and strength and energy I'm breathing life in to you saying you can live so here's God saying uh um I will restore means I'm going to give you a covenant at peace I'm going to be at peace with you it's I'm not going to let you go to bed at night worried that if you don't wake up you're going to be in hell I'm not dangling you over hell this morning by a little chain and God's angry at you or he's upset at you that that might have been how some of you were raised but that's not really the gospel the gospel is good news it is it is God coming to you and saying I have good news for you are we all together it's not one or two issues it's like Lord I'm a mess I'm in trouble and he's like but I got the answer I've got everything you have need of I'm going to bring peace to this situation it means to make you complete and to give you a sound mind I'm going to make you sound say but I see confusion I see pieces all over the place like brother Mitch would understand this you know the computer everything is just all you know fragmented and I just I'm scattered well God just brings that all together and just a few minutes God can do a miracle in just a moment do we believe that in this room some of you are living Miracles i' I've heard your testimonies and and when you hear the word it's not just for you it could be for someone else you say God gave me a new heart God gave me a new spirit God gave me another chance to serve him I'm a second chance and I'm living I'm breathing so I'm going to sing to the top of my lungs or I'm going to shout hallelujah I'm in a room full of Believers that are going in the Rapture God's restoring our sound mind and how we ought to be thinking and it means to be finished or to be ended and to be uninjured that's how God sees you he sees you finished I'm not saying you're finished I so he sees you like completed and he steps back and says wow that's a good work you say but look at the knee it's got a it's got like Michelangelo when they when they Struck it and said you know speak or live there's a flaw we all have flaws stop looking at the flaw you know brother John he has a something on the me that I had to look at every day at his house and you know what that sign says you are perfect to me I thought praise God I need to get that for my wife amen I I should have took that and put it in my suitcase but that would have been stealing but what wouldn't you like to wake up every day and say God sees you perfect God sees you whole I see you restored Hallelujah I will restore sayith the Lord that'd be a wonderful message to wake up to a lot better than the Phoenix news or the national news or what's happening in Afghanistan it'd be a lot better to wake up and say I see you perfect do you agree with that we see that God is making you safe I'm going to make you whole and good again and restoration I will restore means I'm going to give you compensation you were born a loser but I'm I'm going to make you a winner you're born in sin shaped in iniquity and I'm going to come to you at some time in your life and let you know that I died on the cross for your sin and friends we need to tell our children that every day God loves them he's here to save them it's not all their bad habits and all the bad things it's we need to speak the word into our families that's what brings separation in in marriages is a of love that's one of my last quotes but brother Bram said that brings separation in churches is a lack of love God put love back in my heart you know maybe we need a heart surgery and God just say I'm going to put love back into that heart you're Stony you're callous I see your hurt but it's time to come out of that hurt I'm going to take that hurt and I'm going to put some Spirit of oil down in that thing I'm going to put a little balm do youall know what balm me is you mothers know a little bomb I'm going to put a little something on that hurt it's going to be okay my life is over and the internet just dropped off but ah and you know you have drama you have young men that are drama Kings and you have young ladies that are drama Kings you know it's a it's okay it's going to be okay is that right we're just a bunch of kids with God we're we're his sons and daughters we're like ah it's okay you're going to make it there's other brothers and sisters that are going through what you're going through and I've saw them through look we're years down the road now your case isn't all unique and special and I don't know if I'm going to come out of this Hospital you ought to have a totally opposite attitude it's like wow many of God's sons and daughters have come into this hospital and come out and they're serving God so it doesn't matter about all the things it's I'm going to have a restored heart out of this right God's going to make it good and pay back all that you lost I want every person to think about this you were born wrong and God says throughout your life there's going to come a moment when you're going to receive him receive me receive Christ and for eternity I'm going to make all of those wrongs right I'm going to give you a new body I'm going to give you a new life all those old things won't be remembered or come into your mind I'm going to restore everything man that sounds like a place we want to live for look at the last couple things here I will restore means I'm going to reward you I'm going to perform this I'm going to repay it back to you I'm going to make an end of all of this sorrow Hallelujah sometimes I feel like I'm just a messenger and I'm delivering a message to somebody God's saying to you publicly and on the internet today to each one of you I'm going to restore you and bring you back and some of us are like well yeah right you know and this person and that person forget about all the negative say praise God he's going to make an end of all this he's going to perform it he's going to repay you and he's never lied to you he's never lied to me he's never done one bad thing to you ever ever ever our God is great today can somebody shout hallelujah let this motel room hear it hallelujah hallelujah we're not ashamed Jesus Christ is restoring our hearts and bringing us back to our ought to be conditioned now this next slide we have shown literally in the last year sister Danielle you've seen this before but this is like a bride tree you you've been likened to the bride tree and you cut a tree and it shows by the Rings in the tree how many years old it is but it also shows the event of what's happened in that tree or in that person's life and you can see here a scar from a forest fire that happened in a certain year or a certain time of this believer's life you can see the first year when it was born you can can see the Rainy Seasons that uh the tree grew more it was it's wider then in the dry seasons it it was much closer together that year was wasn't as fruitful it wasn't as rainy say this happened last year this happened the year before five years this happened in my life brother John or in our family or this certain church or on my job and you can so describe to where it becomes like a forest fire it's amazing you can see the scar of this tree what it's been through when you cut it like this isn't that amazing in the next slide I wanted to show you this 24 year old tree and how the Rings and then the things that happen in its life but there was a certain year but it looks to me like around after the 10th year of this person's life that something happened to cause a knot can you see that some issue came up it just looked like things are going along fine and things were good you have dry years you have wet years you feel close to God sometimes then there's times you don't feel as close but we're talking about matters of the heart we're talking about a person's life and you can see at some time in their life something happened and it lasted for 5 years it was a knot it was an issue it was a situation it was something happened but but did they make it through did they make it through can you see that for years after I I trust we're doing okay brother Ryan for years later whenever it came around to that certain you know September the 17th or came around to March the 24th it oh it's like an anniversary it's like something you'd like to put it behind you but it caused such a knot and a thing in your life your health your family for 5 years this person or maybe it's a church went through a situation but they came out of it and even though this tree was cut down and you can see the years now they're 24 years old 24 this morning the Holy Spirit laid it upon brother John's heart to say you got to get over the knot you can't live the rest of your life all knotted up and describing and talking about this and somebody done somebody wrong song and you sing that as a you know that's your testimony and no matter how great of meetings you go to who's preaching it's like you always default back on Monday and Tuesday back to the not in your life you know this happened and I want to tell you about it and and friends we got to go further than that amen I I'm speaking I'm taking the Liberty cuz brother Aaron gave me liberty but to speak to Arizona Believers Church and you're now almost a year old here that it's time for us that have come here and will come here that are wounded and been hurt to stop talking about the thing that happened a year ago two years ago three years and you keep going around and around and around it's time for us to be restored and let our hearts be recovered you got to learn to breathe again you got to learn to let go of the past and say I'm not going to let my future be defined by my past I'm going on I'm pressing on I I'm not I don't understand why it happen I'm not here to say this that or the other but I am going on and today is the day when God is saying it's time for you to come out of this knot your past does not define you that hurt does not define you Satan thought he was going to let you lay in the valley and in the desert and you're just going to be dry until the Rapture and probably miss the Rapture and God is saying no I'm sending a voice I'm sending a message this desert's going to bloom again and I'm going to breathe life into that Valley and somebody's going to stand up and say Here I Am Lord in the next slide I trust this is okay you can see that for 20 years of this person's life it was very very uh small let's just say brother loyal they didn't know the Lord that their spiritual Li everything was really small you can see for 20 years that's how it was what's that or 50 for Brother John I mean really brother John your heart's been restored can you stand up brother John not just natur you're not going to stand brother John doesn't know a lot of you because he sits way up here but this is brother just turn around and look at this wonderful this is Brother John faum I mean brother he didn't even know brother Wes niggard very good and we come to the same church so I'm introducing you not only has brother John had a spiritual change he's actually had a natural change in his heart he he could talk more about a heart that has been hurt and in trouble than any of us probably could and God came and literally he has the documentation said that his heart is fine it it's clicking well he don't need to always go back and have him check it and have him check it and have him check it but his heart has been restored he could he when brother John says a restored heart he can says I know exactly what you're talking about but he's here as a witness to all of us that when that would happen to anyone in this church you can say but what God did for him he can do for me and it happens to your wife wife thank you brother John when it happens to your wife you can say but honey God did this for that sister God Did It for that brother well look at we know that family and it always hasn't been easy for them and yet when we see them they're bubbly I mean look at like sister Caden I mean you shake her hand and she smiles and she's like she loves you she's no matter what's happened in her life she loves the Lord Jesus Hallelujah she want she loves the Lord she gave me thumbs up amen I sat in a church it was in Connecticut I'm just giving you this as a side thing and and this little boy back in the back he was going like this kept going like this he was a little boy and he's going like this he said I'm not going to close the service till I get it like this from that little boy and you know what I finally got it I was in another meeting in Dallas a few weeks ago and this brother sitting right over here just sat like this the whole service wouldn't smile kind of looking at brother joh I said I'm not going to close this service until that brother smiles and you know what he did he went like there Hallelujah you know it's good to serve the Lord for 20 years this person had it really tight didn't have a lot of water but something happened you can see for the next nine years something happened it it's just there was more nutrients they call it biosolids but it increases their growth rate it begins to the fertile soil around this tree begin to be uh can we say affected there was a church started in Arizona last year and something started working around this person's life and my as the months went by you can see that person's changed they some water got poured in they had specials they had preaching of the word they Fellowship praise God and you can see the person begin to grow they begin to grow now do you want to go back to the first years or do you want to say God I thank you for this water do you want to go back to the knot or back to the Wildfire or do you want to say God Send the Rain let's go to the next slide this is very uh real as you can see this I'm speaking this morning on a restored heart because I believe with all my heart that if some of you today would give your heart to the Lord he knows how to take care of issues guard your heart for out of it are the issues of life and we see when a person gives their life to Christ it doesn't mean that bad things won't happen to you it means now that throughout this scar brother Ryan's getting his exercise this morning throughout this scar it affected years of this person's life and even when they came out of the fire for years to follow you can see that little halting they're halting they're halting but I'm here to tell you today that person made it through that fire scar I mean there's years that we don't grow as much there's years that we grow more but thanks be to God as the bride tree the next slide tells us all about it in Psalms 107:20 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions God has sent his word to you how many are thankful for the message of the hour here's Harvest Time preached right in Phoenix Arizona speaking about a phoenix or someone that would rise from the ruins some of you ought to say that's me brother John say when I'm going to Phoenix it's going to be dry miserable and a bunch of cactus and there ought to be nope I'm going to see some flowers and some Sons and Daughters of God that they're vibrant they're like lies they're like yes God has sent his word and healed you that means he's making you healthy God is he is your healer he's your physician praise God he he's the Healer of my hurts of all the nations involving a restored favor of individual distresses God is in control of the matter it's like we can be in the middle of a dark time and God walks into the the room and says I'm the light for this situation to be healed means literally of persons or of national hurts or of individual defects he sent his word and healed them that means literally would he come up here can you come up here brother can you come up and see brother John now this young man invited me to church today Hallelujah he invited me to church not last Wednesday but the Wednesday before I kind of came walking through the hallway and he stepped out and he saidou welcome come on in chch I said can I come in there says yeah we're having church he said you can come tonight and you can come to every service I have come to every service since he invited me Hallelujah so I I came to church today brother are you happy about that but yesterday we were sitting at the table e eating this uh good tasty soup and things and then he comes walking in and we start talking about baptism and things he's 8 years old but we started talking about baptism and things like that and how do you know and different times you talk to your parents you might talk to brother Aaron God starts working on your heart and brother John's been down the road enough to know that you know as a young person so it's good for them to know what they're doing that just being being baptized when they're too young because there's many teenagers that grow up and they say I was baptized when I was a young girl a young boy but I really didn't know what I was doing and they want to be re-baptized they want to say I've given my heart back to Jesus so it's very important when they're younger to know that when they're baptized it's for the rest of their life but we were talking about this yesterday and he looked across the the table and you said this word that I just said on the on that screen literally is that an animation do you need to press I don't oh no go back please go back it's right there in the middle literally and he looked at me and said literally and I said you're exactly right it's literally how many's thankful for the Lord that he's literal today isn't that some dream God bless you brother thank you for inviting me to church amen thank you brother maybe he'll invite in some lady one day and say come on in we're having church and it's going to be the last one wouldn't that be fantastic and you all said oh that brother John that's so cute no he might invite in the last man like JD walked in here a few minutes ago and and brother alderson's talking and we're talking to him he says yeah I just gave my heart to the Lord a few days ago and we said praise God that is wonderful and he said I just had to tell somebody I said thank you very much I said all of these people the Lord has changed our heart to praise God I mean people that's not even Believers you say well they don't believe the prophet of Malachi 4 but friends you got to invite them you got to be salty you got to love people they want what you got I mean literally let's all say literally Hallelujah are are we preaching enough of the word are y'all doing okay in the next slide I wanted to introduce you to this place Danielle you're familiar with this last year in June uh my father and mother that I think streaming right now it was their wedding anniversary and so I took them to Olive Garden and it's just across the street from this Care Medical Center and in the next slide you can see I I remember parking my car with my wife and we were meeting my parents there and when I looked across the parking lot I saw that it was the wound healing Center and something this is June my my daughter's birthday is June the 15th I think the 16th is my parents anniversary so here I was in a parking lot look across and I saw the wound healing Center and I thought wow here's a place that the world says if you have a wound you can come into this wound healing Center and we've got what you need to heal that wound I thought why can't there be a wound healing Center for God's people I know a lot of wounded people I know people in the message they been through churches and families and issues and they're wounded I said Lord if you can do that for the natural you can do it for the spiritual and from that time we begin to minister and labor and I think this church actually started after that June but if you go to the next slide this is it was a part of the St Joseph Medical Group and it was called the wound healing Center you go to the next slide and and we talked about the wounds and we spoke some messages for young people and uh even locally globally it's gone about the wound healing Center and how that if you had a wounded heart or you have a wounded situation that God can help you the great physician now is near he sent his word and it healed the people you know just to know that you know it's not the end it's not all over God there is a there's a rescue for this the search and rescue is after you and they're going to find you and so we've spoke about that but now in the next slide and I'm coming down to this morning's message which I really want everyone to get because in this wound healing Center that's what they deal with is bruises wounds next slide whether it's on your leg or on your shoulder on your hand an abrasion or on your foot you can see how this person on your right hand side to try to you say but I want to run I come on brother Mitch let's go run today or let's go ride a bike this person would say I'm wounded I would love to It's No Lack of Desire but this certain thing happened and I just can't do that I I know I need exercise I know I'd like to be with brother Mitch and I know I'd like to get out there but look at my foot and you say oh I understand or we see people in the church and they come walking in and they have their families but really you can see that there's a wound there's a scar you say I would love to praise I would love to be a strong believer I would love to just be dynamic but brother John when that happens in church or when I see it just there's just something in me like a heaviness like a Brokenness and I can't rise up out of that that's what a wound healing Center is for it's for you to come in wounded and to be helped next slide you can see the different stages of of a wound and how it can be very very raw and very much immediate and very much like this is real and then as time goes on it has a way of healing it has a way of bringing you back but there will be a scar there there's like a something that happened on the next slide you can see a scar that this happened and you know you does any of you have it on your hand or on your arm where or on your leg you say that's a scar I remember that was that happened I remember this happened I remember a fox you know I was in a field and a fox and then brother Donnie rean talks about scars and and he a fox that bit him on his hand some of you might have been a dog and you might have fell down and it's like there's always that tenderness at this certain part of the situation and it's caused a scar next slide but what I wanted to Bringing to you today when you look at that scar a scar is evidence that healing is taking place you need to stop digging at the scar you need to stop always talking about the scar you need this happened and you go around you know the next slide is again you can see it's like it's something visual something that happened in your past an injury but it didn't lead you to death some of you ought to be shouting by the time you leave today saying thank you Jesus or at least under your breath or in your heart you ought to be saying praise God lord what Satan thought for evil God's turned this around and you know what but he put a scar on me so that I'll always remember how great is our God not how bad is that incident or I can never trust men brother John or I can never have confidence in it no no no that's that's not the reason for that God allowed that to happen but it did not end in death am a scar is evidence that something happen in your past but it didn't take your life and you ought to be thankful today if you even have a desire for God you ought to be thankful I mean I was speaking to brother Michael Jenkins about his life and his testimony and he he doesn't well he knew it this morning because I told him but there was a brother from Africa a senior pastor from Uganda that that saw his photo that I had put on my status I was with the Jenkin family and the Torres family and they said is this you know Michael Jenkins yes you know and and I told them about brother and he and he just said praise God it just like made his day that you could have a Michael Jenkins go through what he's gone through in his life family and past and be serving God and be a song leader at Arizona Believers Church I mean that brother in Africa was just so elated brother Michael and I had to tell brother Michael we're not even aware sometimes that we are positively being a testimony for others that God God is alive God is restoring my heart I I'm a work in progress say where' that scar come from your face why is that down across your nose well you can be like all embarrassed you can be like yeah oh yeah and you can go like this the rest of your life or you can say you know what I'm going to give praise to God I have a scar across my face but I have my nose and I have my face pray praise be to God a lot of people complain about their feet and their shoes until they meet somebody that don't have feet and they don't have shoes then they realize God's blessed me so you can see here in the next slide I'm I'm not going to stay on it long because it's a little bit open here but on the left you can see this burn that happened on someone's body and after 120 days after four months you can see on the right hand side the same arm same leg same situation but there's a scar and it was raw I mean four months ago it was instant it was like you know we left the service we were going to go eat and then this happened and we're in the emergency we're in this wound healing Center we're in this place but four months later you can say wow we can walk again we can breathe again we can give a testimony again it it wasn't the way it used to be but praise God I'm going forward now as you look now in the next slide this is very strong I want every person to get this it's time for you to leave the wound healing center after you've heard the word after you've been counseled after you've been around for some months it's been almost a year now it's time for some of you to say you know what this happened in my life this happened in my family this happened in my past church but today I'm leaving the wound healing Center I'm saying I visited there I was healed but I'm no longer going to let that rule my life you cannot live here that can't be your address as much as all the nurses loved you and you got candy and all the attention but you cannot live there you got to walk out of there and you got to get in your car say well somebody had to drive me home I get it and there might be 6 months of Rehabilitation or a year where you deal with this issue but you cannot live here we're not renting out rooms and you can't make that your permanent address oh well why not the nurses and the secretary and no no no the doctors they just came rushing in and and they had compassion and they they understood exactly what to do and they set my bone and yeah but you can't live there you got to leave you got to go you got to go back to your home home and back to your job and back to your life and serve God in spite of all of that I'm not denying that happened for you and I'm not denying that that was a horrible thing but you've got to rise above that you've got to say I have a restored heart brother John God's done something for me and I'm going to live the rest of my days thanking God and I'm not going to be a statistic for the enemy and be sad and mournful I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God he's restored my heart I I have some heart now praise be to God is that okay today Arizona Believers Church I'm a visiting Minister but some of you got to get up and you got to go say but I can't that's why we're having Church we're just going to keep having church until you can get up and go we're going to carry you we're going to Sing For You Preach for you I hope one day you have a a wonderful building that is your church and the brothers don't have to pack up the instruments and Micah don't have to bring this and brother John's not coming two hours before and brother Mike an hour before and everybody's I trust you can get a sanctuary at least I could get a smile out of somebody amen I trust one day you can say praise God look at what God's done for us but in the meantime we're not going to be sad and mournful and always talk about the negative and where I came from and no no we're going forward I am turning my face toward the sun I am being healed it's okay brother John God's got it all in control say but do you know everything about tomorrow no I don't but I've got it all it's in his hands let's turn to Psalms 103 please as we come now to the end of the service and the day how many's ever read in the Book of Psalms and seen for the psalm for the sons of Kora for the sons of Kora for the sons of Kora have y'all ever seen that I I don't think this is one of those but this is a Psalm of David but there's many Psalms written in Psalms it says for the sons of Kora and some of you might remember what Kora did when they he stood against Moses and stood against the message and tried to say we're going to do this that and the other and God swallowed them up with the Earth yall remember that but do you know in the Bible it says the sons of Kora died not and that is a whole another service it's just a oneliner in fact I I don't know if it's in numbers or what chapter it says says but the sons of Kor died not and in the other place where the Joshua Judges that says the ground opened up and them their wives and children all got swallowed up it makes it look like everybody that was connected to them died but there's one verse in the Bible that says the sons of Kor died not in other words that he had some family members that said we're not going to be part of that we're not going to be part of that bad mouth in and what's going on we believe the message We Believe what a prophet said we're going on to the promised land and some of you know you can read it in chonicles and other places the the kites became a whole family in the message that they were helpers around the church and they were they helped and they sang and you can read that it was the family of Kora that died not they kept being a testimony and where others you say well what about Judas or what about Kora oh bad thing bad bad bad family but there were some in that family that said we're not going to let what happened to that Dad of ours or that Uncle or that Grandpa we're going on with God read the Psalms and where it says the sons of Kora read where it talks about the kites they were a family in the church that kept on serving God I just say praise God I mean that was all free that was just you know it might be for somebody to say you know what I don't have I don't have to follow all the negativism my dad my mom my uncle my grandpa I'm serving God I'm going on I don't know how I don't know why but I'm rising above this today I mean I'm rising Above This Psalms 103:1 a Psalm of David bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord my I feel my heart being restored bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health some of thy diseases mental illness mental diseases stress pressure heartache heart trouble Brokenness misunderstanding here's the Bible who Health all thy diseases amen who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction friends you don't have to have a bad attitude the rest of your life you're not a victim I said you're not a victim you need to stop posting that playing the victim card always thinking like you're this and that you're not a victim you're a son and daughter of God you already know the end there should be no bad mouthing bad talking we're going on with God and and friends I believe that ought to be a spirit in this church it after today it ought to be even more just turn the dial up a little bit we're positive we're happy and we're overcoming I tell you I want to be around people that are on fire for God I want to be around people that when I'm down they can lift me up when I'm sick they pray for me oh well serves him right you know I know that he's been there must be hidden sin in his life you know we've had all that but don't you want to be around people that pray for one another and encourage one another I mean no we don't know how people live outside these doors but friends there's going to be people that that they're looking at your life they want to see Jesus there was a time in the Bible Jesus was in a house and it was so packed out they couldn't get in but there was a couple friends that said our our friend is in need so in the middle of the service they started cutting a removing the tiles removing the singles what's going on plaster falling and all of a sudden we see a body being lowered in the middle of the service we got to get our friend to Jesus try the front door try the back door try the deacons they say no try this everybody's saying no no no we're going on the roof we're ripping up the tiles we're ripping but what about the cost I don't care our friends in need and friends we talk about Lord I'm desperate for you are you desperate well as long as you know my face looks good and my clothes and are not all sweaty no we need to cut a hole in the roof and put our friend down there I want to see him walk out of here free man God give some of you friends like that your friends and people you're around is always talking negative and bad we need to be around some people that's willing to cut a hole in a roof and get me to Jesus don't worry about the cost I'll pay for the crazy in the roof now we had to replace the whole roof brother John replace the whole roof I'm well I'm whole Jesus touched me let's Tell The World Hallelujah I'll take care of and I'll sweep up all the plaster look at this verse four who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles just because you're older don't need to mean that you get crabby nasty opposite and negative just because you've been down a rough road and been on the hard side of the street and people stole from you they smashed your car they wounded you they said things on the internet about you they made websites about you you ought to have a spirit I don't care I'm serving Jesus I'm so drunk on the Holy Ghost it doesn't matter what you say about me we need more people like that so that our new youth is renewed like the eagles y'all ever think you're really old yall to go hiking with brother Dale back there he he took me hiking the other day and he's going up and down the mountains and down the trails I'm like praise God if I in half like this when I'm 80 something years old God renew our youth it energizes you when you see someone in the church serving in and doing and going when you know in their private life there's issues or there's things they're not using it for a crutch they're doing something for God and when job prayed for his friends that's when God answered his prayers so go to the last book of Job and read that again when job prayed for his friends that's when God gave him a double portion maybe you need to pray for others just do it for others do something for somebody else and watch God do something for you he'll restore your heart he'll restore your life he he he wants to bring you don't forget about all his benefits and what he's trying to do in your life and bring it all back our last quote here brother John's going to move it along here as brother brandham closed out the church age book he said not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become new creatures in God filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite and plead and warn and all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart how many you would just say Lord I don't want to draw things to myself I want to draw them to you Lord and I want to see a spiritual relationship between myself and you Lord so that I would be able to draw others to you Lord to see this established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men you and I have an obligation if God restores your heart for you to help someone else's heart to be restored we've been in the wound center we've been healed now it's some of you have heard messages and you're so grateful brother Aaron McGary moved to this area and you're so happy and and I see it I've been with you even yesterday I felt the energy of this congregation I think it's good for all of us to say you know what the past is the past we're going forward in the name of the Lord and we're not going to fellowship and talk even with one another about all the bad things and start listing them all down we're going to it might be a valley and it still might be a valley of dry bones in some of your situations and I trust that no one misunderstood brother John today there might still be a valley in your life there might still be dry bones there might be somebody walking here next Sunday that's really really broken and they need some time that's not the time to say get out of the wound healing Center get out of here we're all liberated no you need to bring that person in like you were healed that God had time for you like someone looked beyond your fault and saw the need and ministered to you and poured in oil and poured in wine but you can't live at the end forever you say well I'm never going down that road in between you know two St and Phoenix or Jericho or Jerusalem I'm never going down that road again because there's a bad accident I'm always going to take this other Road and that can haunt you and you can talk to your husband and your wife and all your children can be raised you don't go down that road you don't go you know exit 223 we always take the bypass do you know what that is you're letting something in the past control your future it'll affect your wife your husband your children and they're better than that you you say family we are going down the road this happened but we're still living we're alive you have mommy you have Daddy we have one another we're going to make it together you know what that does it gives energy it says you know what we're we're not going to take a detour and always this and that we're going on we're serving the lord we're going to be a strong people God bless you today my sermon is over may the Lord fill this [Applause] church I know brother Aaron could have said that in five or 10 minutes but took me over an hour but God bless you let's leave the wound healing Center and say you know what I'm going to live the rest of my life so that someone else can be healed heavenly father I spoke what you laid on my heart about a restored heart today I've heard the testimonies of many in this church we've been around them for a few days we've been in their homes Lord I could have took the last week and just stayed in my little room and listen to tapes I could could have prayed the whole time and we we still would have had a wonderful service today but for the last few days we've went out of our comfort zone we've went into homes we've went into coffee shops we've went down Trails we wanted to know the people we wanted to get to know them personally we wanted to know their lives and what they'd gone through Lord we're not avoiding the past we're it's not like we can't talk about it but we're asking today for healing and strength oil and wine and for Spiritual courage that if there's any of your people that are here that have been into that spiritual wound healing Center and there's always that human feeling and way that I wish I could live here I I wish it was like this all the attention and all the WoW you can see I can sleep here and but you got to leave that place you got to go out the front door and you got to go back to your life in Christ Lord Jesus that's where we need strength that's where we need Faith that's where we need to take what we've heard and put it into practice don't let us be Sunday morning Christians don't let us just be people that when the preachers preaching we yes but then we got to go back to our sorrow and back to our confusion and back our Darkness Lord we've heard a whole message today on a restored heart that our hearts are being restored our attitudes are being restored our our spirit is being renewed we're receiving the heart of God this message has the power and the anointing behind it to heal the brokenhearted those that are bruised oh there have been those that have been troubled those that even have death on them those that are stinky those that are wrapped in grave clothes maybe somebody was trying to make their Tombstone and a little feeble broken humble man after 4 days come up to the tomb and begin to weep and he opened up his mouth and he said Lazarus come forth and there was so much power of the Resurrection in those words that a man that had been dead and stinking and Grave clothed came walking out of there Satan thought he had our Tombstone all being made up that we were going to be another one of his statistics just another man just another woman just another young person just another family just another church it's just another startup group that's just going to go along and along Lord but today we've heard a message that puts some strength into us like vitamins it's an encouragement it's someone from the outside coming to visit us to give us a word of encouragement I bless them today Lord I bless this little gathering of people I pray for the future that you'd provide a place for them of worship and Gathering oh as our brother spoke yesterday of the past history even of this own City and how you came after a certain time and provided a place I believe there's a place provided I believe there's a sanctuary I believe there's an altar I believe there's a closing Lord and an atmosphere for these people that they can be healed they can walk out say thank you thank you thank you Jesus they nod at the nurse they thank the secretary they wave to the doctor and they say thank you thank you thank you thank you Jesus is there anybody here like that that with all our heads bowed would just slip up your hand and say thank you Jesus thank you Lord
