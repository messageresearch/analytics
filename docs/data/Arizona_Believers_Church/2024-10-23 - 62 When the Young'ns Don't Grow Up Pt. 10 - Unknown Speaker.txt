TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you could take your Bibles and turn to Hebrews chap 12 I'd like to read the entire chapter and I'm not joking I would actually like to read the entire chapter if I'm not able to get to it because we run out of time towards the end Maybe by reading it now I can just quickly reference uh many of these things and perhaps we could uh we could just kind of walk through it together even as we read it and as we're standing uh maybe make some point some things out but my Bible has a heading the auth author and finisher of our faith the one who has begun it and the one who will perfect it he says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses and these are the faith of the Patriarchs and uh Moses and all these other Faithful Servants we're compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our Faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God so we see Christ who endured who persevered being forward-looking and having conquered and having overcome he's given this place in position at the right hand of the Throne of God so it tells us for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds I believe that's important to kind of catch this Paul is addressing whether or not we'd ever lose our result we wouldn't remain uh remain deliberate and perseverant you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement where of all are partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection under the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed here's some uh pretty Specific Instructions in light of all this follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligent lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright now this is quite a a warning in this passage we are sons and he dealth with his sons and and Christ overcame and he persevered don't faint don't faint he gives us this image of Esau for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears for you not come under the mount that might be touched that burned with fire nor un Blackness and darkness and Tempest the sound of a trump and the voice of Words which voice they had heard that heard entreated that the words should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible is the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion and under the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and an inumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to God the judge of all and the spirits of just men made perfect and to the Jesus the meteor of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now Heath promised saying yet once more I shake not earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of those things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiveing a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire amen you can be seated I appreciate your patience as we read uh that lengthy text not sure if we'll be able to finish tonight but this would be part 10 on when the youngans don't grow up and it just kind of I was planning on preaching this particular sermon and this subject matter on a Sunday morning just to have a little bit more time and all of us be together but I believe the Lord has just orchestrated it where it falls on a Wednesday night and so I feel maybe a little bit pressed for time and so we'll just be uh not maybe covering it in depth as I would have wanted to but I believe the point will be able to get across and the whole subject of when the young ons don't grow up is about maturity about growing into all that you can be and not failing in any potential it's about adoption as the last service we were ministering on that young trees May Frolic but mature trees fruit and so we're going from Frolic uh to fruit to maturity to expressing fully what we are enjoying all the rights and privileges that come with being a Son of God now in Galatians 4: 1 and 2 just going to jump right into it he says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father uh Paul is looking at the subject of adoption he even uses this uh phrasing in the next few verses that this adoption which pertained to Israel which had it had its time of placing an adoption there at the end of the Old Testament he's presenting this to the Galatians and he's talking about them who've been Bewitched and they didn't finish the race and there was a lot of things that were working against them and expressing this principle he says the heir and this Heir is the one who WR by right of sunship uh is allotted an inheritance or a possession and so this Heir would be called a son but then he says as long as he is a child as long as he is one underage as the Greek would say it or as one who's between infancy in manhood as long as he is a child he differs nothing from a servant so there's a difference in the scripture between one a young who hasn't grown up yet someone that hasn't matured or a child and one that is a son where you said this is my son and this it's to express something Beyond just childhood and as long as he is underage or he's between infancy and maturity he is a servant in other words he has no more freedom than a servant as even the Greek would render it slave he has no more uh Liberty to make his own decisions he's not at his own disposal in some ways we could say that though he may be trusted to carry out certain duties there is not full trust committed to him so he's an heir and has a son and by right of sunship he has some inheritance or possession that has been allotted to him or that's going to be received received by him but as long as he hasn't grown up he's no different than a servant being no different than a servant he's under tutor so he's kept under teaching and in instruction and he's nurtured and corrected because as long as he is a child he doesn't he's not at his own disposal he doesn't have uh free reign and the Bible says though he be Lord of all and being Lord of all it means that by title he the whole estate belongs to him by the fact that he is the heir by the fact that he is the son uh it belongs to him but he doesn't have full possession yet he's not in possession fully of what he is a lord too he's Lord of all but yet he's not fully in possession so Paul is presenting a very quick complete picture that a child though he's an heir will never assume full responsibility and complete control over that which is allotted to him and granted to him until he's been raised up to a place and as he says to the Corinthians no longer a child but becomes a man so the heir differs nothing from any other servant and the Jesus says the servant abideth not in the house but the son abided in the house forever but this son if he's as long as he is a child he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father wherein he would then be conveyed it would be granted to him and given to him as an inheritance all those things that he was Lord over so this is according to the law of inheritance or I would like to say maybe the right of the firstborn under the law if you're to study this study the subject of first Bor in the Old Testament and especially the subject of redemption and the Redemption of a possession the Redemption of an inheritance and we're just going to be scratching the surface but this is the law of adoption in the Old Testament how many have ever heard brother Bram referred to the law of adoption in the Old Testament how many have gone into it tried to find adoption as a word in the Old Testament well it's really hard to find I've even had ministers tell me in the past that there is no place in the Old Testament where there is a law of adoption but yet there some mysterious that brother Brandon would refer to it but here we're going to see in the scripture what brother Brandon was referring to he refers to the law of adoption in the Old Testament brother Bram defined adoption as a son being placed not your birth he said but you're placing and so it's the law of an heir or a child coming into full possession of receiving what had been determined to be his once he comes to that place of maturity and that's very clear in brother brenham's teaching now if you turn to Deuteronomy chapter 21 I'm going to be reading from verse 15 to 23 but I think initially we're just going to read to verse 17 here verses 15 16 and 17 now just kind of focus I gave kind of a setup there with Galatians 4 Paul is teaching this to the New Testament Church he's drawing from these things that we're now going to go over for a few moments here and let's not get lost in uh the polygamy here or the nature of man because it's actually C out the nature of man to have preferences and to hate one and love another and it's not espousing for that but it's addressing this Dynamic that could happen if a man has a mistress or has a child by another woman so it says if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have borne him children both the Beloved and the hated so in the language said a man has had Sons but has children by two different women and he loves one of the women and he hates the other he says and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated so now do you see the setup a man has children by two different women he loves one woman and he hates the other but the one he hates is the one that delivers him his first son verse 16 addresses this uh mess that a man can get himself into because of human nature then it shall be when he maketh his Sons to inherit that which he hath so here's the law this isn't necessarily establishing the law but it's dressing what was common and what would be traditional and what they would have done by right when he comes to maketh his when he comes when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath this is what a father would do he'd make his sons to inherit that he may not make the son of the Beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn so you catch what verse 16 is saying that a man loves one woman and has a son but the woman he hates has his firstborn and that man cannot show favoritism to the second born son and give him what he should have given his firstborn when he makes his son to inherit this when this time when he's going to be either granting the blessing or conveying things he cannot give the Beloved Sons the an inheritance above the firstborn because he said the son of the hated is indeed the firstborn verse 17 said but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his this is the law of the firstborn this is what the law of adoption relates to this is what Redemption is tied to so IT addresses a situation where a man would have a son who is indeed his firstborn but because of human emotion and and jealousies and and kind of a pre predisposed to certain feelings wanting to play favorites he would take that which was the right of the firstborn and give it to actually one who is not the firstborn it says he shall acknowledge the firstborn by giving him what is due and that is a double portion of all that he hath he says for he is the be he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his so the firstborn is called scripturally the beginning of the father's strength in Genesis 49:3 it says Ruben Thou Art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength here we see in the in the beginning of the children of Israel and the sons of Israel uh in the lineage of Abraham Isaac and Jacob Ruben Thou Art my firstborn listen to the language that he uses my might and the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power this is the concept of the firstborn it is the uh this is these are the things that pertain to the firstborn this is how the firstborn is viewed and the and the awe and the honor that would be granted to the first born now as we don't have time tonight I'm sure some of you could be thinking in the scripture of many different places where the firstborn comes up and these things that were reading answer to why God condemned the firstborn in that last plague of death in The Exodus it speaks to us why the firstborn was to be offered up as a sacrifice to God and these tithes and these offerings that were given you would give the first give the firstborn as a matter of fact when um the priesthood was being established all Israel was to allow their firstborn son to serve in the temple and to serve God and and though there was some changing with that as time continued it was this idea that there was something special about a firstborn son and it says that the right it says my might the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power so the right of dignity and power and authority in the family belong to the firstborn now it doesn't mean the firstborn gets all of it just because he's the firstborn son it's in the father but all that the father has and his dignity and his might and his power and his strength is seemingly now going to be projected to and is as his strength wanes it's coming up in his son and all that might and dignity and Excellency in the family that was the father's will is due to and belongs to the firstborn as the firstborn son he is the perspective head of the family he is due certain rights and certain honors and he has certain responsibilities that others wouldn't have as the Bible says here and many affirm that that he was to get twice as much of an inheritance as anybody else in the family as it says giving him a double portion of all that he had and is he would he would have preeminence among the other siblings and the other brothers this is Ruben the firstborn might and beginning of strength Excellency of dignity Excellency of power his concept is just throughout the Old Testament in Psalms 89: 26 and 27 speaking of the Messiah he shall cry unto me thou art my father my God and the rock of my salvation and I will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the Earth this is because he is the firstborn he says I will make him my firstborn and as the firstborn he's going to be a king and there's other kings but he will be a king higher than all the other kings of the Earth in Galatians chapter 3 when he's saying you are all children of God by faith in Jesus Christ and that we are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise he's finishing up chapter 4 and he says now Brethren as Isaac was uh are we are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman in her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the bond woman but of the free this is again drawing on this law of the firstborn for the Bible says the right of the firstborn is his and ishma who is born of the handmaid and the or the Bond woman saying he is not the heir he is not the proper son but that which is born of Sarah he is going to be he's the child of the promise and to him belongs the Covenant to him belongs the promise and in Genesis chapter 22 it's the Lord that says take thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest tells him to do what take him up on a mountain that I'll show thee and to sacrifice him but it's Isaac the Beloved son this is my beloved Son it's the same image that God gives Jesus Christ thine only son he is to he is considered and deemed by God to be the firstborn son and in Genesis CH 25: 5 and 6 for those of you are trying to track this and keep notes we're just building off of Deuteronomy 21 that's speaking about the right of the firstborn and saying that in Psalms 89 n God says I'm going to make him my first born and as the firstborn is going to be higher than all the kings of the earth and now we're seeing this example in Abraham as Ruben the firstborn my might and my beginning of strength the Excellency of dignity and power here we see Abraham in verse 5 and Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac so that's the the the conveyance to the firstborn now he has other sons and notice what it says but under the sons of the concubines which Abraham had Abraham gave gifts now what would you rather have all or the gifts and Unto the Sons of the concubines which Abraham had Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son while he yet lived Eastward unto the East Country again when the servant of Abraham goes to find a bride for Isaac he tells the he tells Rebecca H uh unto him I come and my servant unto him has he given all that he have my my this son that I'm coming to find a wife for the scripture shows that Isaac the firstborn of Abraham the Beloved of Abraham is receiving all that Abraham had this is the right of the firstborn doesn't mean the father can't give gifts to others but all that he has belongs to the son all that he was this is what the son receives now an interesting scripture and again we're just kind of scratching the surface here I uh if the Lord would give us Liberty sometime in the future to go into this in Greater detail I would enjoy that myself self we could always Fellowship on it together uh as Believers just outside of this context but some this has just given us a lot of um just some things to look at in the word of God to help us on this subject now notice this interesting scripture in Deuteronomy chapter 25 verses 5 to1 if Brethren dwell together and one of them die and have no child the wife of the Dead shall not marry without unto a stranger now that seems strange why is she not able to Remar now marry without the family outside of the family unto a stranger a foreigner one who is not related and so this is cautioning if a if a man has a wife and she has no children and then he's dead doesn't want this woman just to go marry someone else but he says her husband's brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her now we all picking up what is being laid down here in Deuteronomy that a a brother is married to a woman and he has a younger brother a brother who's not married is what the scripture is supposing and it's kind of this is what they're building off of in the New Testament where they go to Jesus and say well a man had a wife and this one died and then that one you know he died and his brother married her then he died and brother married her and it's like all the brothers married the same girl and it's like well whose wife is she going to be in heaven well it's drawing from this example here in the law where when a man dies without having an heir it's the duty of the brother to perform the duty of a husband to the his wife his brother's wife and it shall be that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead that his name be not put out of Israel now this I want you as we do not have time for this but instead of just saying oh well that's kind of odd ask yourself why is it this way it's because the land was so important The Possession was so important that place in Palestine that ground that they were given their position their identity the future promises the Resurrection the Millennium all these things was was held these types in this great location even the origin of humanity and all these things that were meant there in this land of promise which God gave Abraham saying when this woman when a wife a man dies without children that another one in the family would marry her and bring and she bring forth a son then that son will succeed in the name of the one that's dead so that his name is not abolished from Israel says if the man like not to take his brother's wife then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders now I want you to draw upon your understanding of what brother brandham called The Law of adoption in the Old Testament and how that he would say at a time appointed of the Father the father would take the son in the gate before the elders and he would perform a ceremony he called it the ceremony of adoption he' give him a robe and he said this my son who is my Heir I now confer upon him all rights and privileges uh that I would have he stands in the stead of me he speaks I speak no longer and this was done in the presence of Elders in the gate but now this is something totally different in the same presence of Elders he says my husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother he had a duty he had to perform it and she's saying he won't then the Elders of his his City shall call him and speak unto him and if he stand to it and say I like not to take her sounds very proper then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders and loose his shoe from off his foot and spit in his face and shall answer and say so shall it be done unto the that man that will not build up his brother's house that's what a son is a builder of the family name building up the brother's house and his name shall be called in Israel the house of him that ha that hath his shoe loosed quite a statement uh trust you can see just even this parallel and this overlap with the house of the Lord here is a man who dies without having a son and it was the duty of his brother to go and to take his widow to wife and to have a son who would raise up his name from the dead and keep the possession in the family and keep his name alive in Israel but when that brother would refuse to perform the duty if it was one who would not build up his brother's house think of the rights and responsibilities that we have as children of God and our role and our place in the house of the Lord these are just a few scriptures that speak of this law of the firstborn we see that there was one a husband who has two wives and he has a firstborn by a woman that he hates even though he may hate her and love the son of this the this other wife that he loves he is to give the right of the firstborn to the proper firstborn he is to receive a double portion for he is the beginning of the father's strength this is the law of the firstborn that we see Reuben my first born the law of the firstborn in Psalms 89 I will make him my first born higher than the kings of the earth we see it in in Isaac the Beloved of Abraham whom Abraham gave all though he had other sons that he gave gifts to it was Isaac that all pertained to and then with these principles in Scripture Deuteronomy 25 it shows that a woman who did not have a son that the brother is to bring forth a firstborn to bring forth a son who had then receive all that that father had now in Romans chapter 8: 29 it says for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren this again is a reference to the law of inheritance the right of the firstborn Christ is the firstborn but we are to be conformed to the image of Christ that he might be the firstborn among any Brethren the use of the term firstborn to a Jew would make them immediately begin to think of Isaac and think of all these different rights in Deuteronomy 21 and Deuteronomy 25 and the sacrifices and the offerings and all these laws of the firstborn the Messiah who was to be his firstborn higher than the kings of the earth and now we are being brought into view of being he being the firstborn the true firstborn and let me say this as the firstborn there are things due to him that are not due to anyone else that's why we do not worship brother Brandon we do not worship other prophets but we worship Jesus Christ it is what's du him it is his right he has received all the glory and honor of the father but he's to be the firstborn among many brethren in Colossians 1: 12 to20 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light so there's Thanksgiving to God who's made us a worthy and and fit to be partakers to receive an inheritance together with the Saints in light God who hath the father had delivered us from the power of darkness and ha translated us into the kingdom Reign the kingdom of his dear son so here is an image of a father with a son and there's an inheritance and he's translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and made us partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in whom we have reded Redemption through his blood because these things are tied to Redemption even the Forgiveness of sins speaking of this firstborn Christ his dear son for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church he's the head he's the prent one he's the chief he's the king who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead and that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven Jesus Christ is the firstborn from the dead he was the only begotten son he's the first born of every creature it pleased the father him being the firstborn to give to give his son the kingdom it pleased the father that in him the firstborn all fullness would dwell it pleased the father that in him and through him all things would be reconciled by him we read in Hebrews chapter 1:2 that he has spoken by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds in Psalms 2: 6 to8 yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion this is the Messiah this is Christ I will declare the decree the Lord hath said unto me thou art my son son this day have I begotten thee now this is different than saying Thou Art my son today you were born or today you were conceived but this speaks to something different Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee it's a specific time when this king is placed upon the Holy Hill of Zion it's a coronation it's a climax it's a handing over all things ask of me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for thy inheritance in the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession to who the son the firstborn the one Heath appointed heir of all things Thou Art my son this day I'm going to Grant to you all things all power and Dominion in Heaven and Earth the the Heathen as an inheritance the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession as the firstborn and I know I'm just reviewing some scriptures we've read in the past and just tried to find some select ones because my you want I want just read all the things we've been reading on maturing and growing up and and these things in this context Revelations 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son not as a birth or not at Birth but this again is that coronation this is the placing he that overcometh shall inherit all things and this is my son this day have I begotten thee I'm conveying the blessing I'm granting possession I'm giving you everything that was right to you do to you Revelations 1: 5 to6 and Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth and him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood this is the Messiah this is the first born he's the first begotten the law and the rights of the firstborn are his he's the prince of the kings of he's higher he's better than all the kings of the earth and by his blood he's washed us from our sins and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever notice how we have been made Kings and Priests but he is the prince and the ruler of Kings he is the high priest and we are the priest he is the greatest he is the preeminent but he has the firstborn is do that the rest of us we've been made Kings and priest but to him is glory and Dominion forever and ever not yet in full possession but in Revelations 5 when the book is open we shall reign with him why because now the firstborn has shared his inheritance with us for Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3: 21-23 want you to see that in Christ the firstborn the right of the firstborn belong to him but then God is going to share with us his glory according to the Covenant according to the promise through Christ and yet we can be Kings and Priests yet not ourselves in full possession though Christ is he says therefore let know man glory in men for all things are yours whether Paul or Apollos or sephus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come don't let Paul apollis or sephus of the world or life life or death or things don't don't let any man glory in men don't let any of these things take anything away from you for all or yours this is what's promised to you as children in Jesus Christ he says you are Christ and Christ is God's all things are yours he's going to give us all things in Jesus Christ this is the right of children of God Romans 8:17 and if children then hirs HS of God and not just Heirs of God joint HS with Christ the first B born in in way you could look at it two ways being the firstborn he was literally the first son of the father but to be the firstborn there was also rights and privileges associated with it so the firstborn also carries this connotation of being an heir one who stood to receive the rights and laws of the firstborn and so if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so we are Heirs of God it's a relationship that could never change we're joint HS with Christ and is sharing that Glory sharing that throne and sharing all things is dependent upon whether or not we go through this process of character development to be glorified together with him now I know it begs the question and maybe even the Paradox well does that mean if I not disciplined and I don't do this and I don't do that does it mean I'm not going to be glorified together with him all I could say is pointed to the scripture that shows that there is a process that God is trying to B bre bring the believer through and those who come out through that process as Overcomers those who at the end of this process are able to stand before God and present things that are Tried by fire and that survive to them is a reward given Amen in Galatians 4: 6 and 7 and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father The Book of Romans he calls it the spirit of adoption wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an Arab God through Christ you are not a servant you are not foreign born you are not of a different household you are of the household of God the household of faith and if a son then you are an heir And that son as long as he is a child he will differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all though all things are his and all things are yours though you're an heir of God and join heirs with Christ there's a process that God puts us through there's a process of growing up and is because of this right of the firstborn Galatians 4: 1 and 2 now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father if we could just for just briefly just think about this scripture and try to get a picture in our mind what Paul is saying the first born according to scripture and I hope we've read enough just to give an idea of what the Bible presents in great depth and Detail in other places that the firstborn assumed the headship of the family when a king had a son he's called a prince but what does he become one day becomes a king a high priest could have a son and he could be a priest but one day he becomes the high priest whatever the father was the firstborn becomes that not every son could do that only the firstborn could do that they could not occupy that same position at the same time so it's one of the things in the right Kings and all these different battles and The Heirs and that's why uh wives would you know would kill other sons and there would always be this fighting in the in in the world and in the Thrones because the heir the son the firstborn son if he was the son of a king then one day though he's just a prince now and though he may have some Authority he one day is going to be a king so the firstborn of a king becomes a king the firstborn of a high priest becomes the high priest the master the head the chief the ruler the leader whatever it was if there was a leader there was an owner there was Master it's the firstborn who stood in line to take the place of the Father the firstborn stood to receive all power a double portion the he was to have the preeminence among the family he was the one that would be looked to as the ruler and the leader and because of that the Bible says he was trained he was taught he was instructed he was corrected why because he's the firstborn not just because he's the firstborn but because of the right of the firstborn a lot of times we think well the firstborn this and the firstborn that and and it's just because they're the firstborn and we go by birth order and we go by all these different things but the reality is there was things promised to the firstborn things that were his and he could say one day this will be mine and that's going to be my name I'm the Builder of my father's house and I'm going to be the one that's going to inherit all this Kingdom if he was a prince one day the throne was going to be his if he was a priest one day that right of the high priest to enter into the most holy place was going to be his and because of that they looked out over the firstborn and it begs the question well what happens when the young doesn't grow up if this is what the firstborn was going to get the prince one day is going to become king the priest is going to become high priest the the the son of the firstborn of the chief is going to be the chief the son of the leader is going to be the leader the the son of the master the firstborn is going to become the master well what happens if that firstborn son by right to take the throne has never grown up what if he doesn't know how to lead what if he doesn't know how to go in and out what if he doesn't have the wisdom that a king should have what if he's never matured and taken responsibility well the Bible addresses that now we're finally answering the question when the youngans don't grow up in Deuteronomy chapter 21 we read verse 17 earlier and as we were reading it about the the the son when he maketh his sons to inherit all that he hath he is to give a double portion of all that he has to the firstborn the true firstborn born but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his what is this a reference to the law of adoption the law of the firstborn the rights of inheritance Redemption and it tells you that whatever this father had his firstborn is going to get it if it's in Isaac he gets all if it's in this scenario under the law he gets twice as much everyone else has there's some people get gifts and they can have the gifts but my name is now going to be conferred upon my first born and everything that I was in life he is going to have and he is going to have the preeminence and he's going to have the ownership and he's going to have the right to pass down everything I passed to him to his children to his firstborn now that's quite uh it's quite a law of testation that's quite a law of secession and a law of inheritance and who it gets passed to so so a father would give everything he has essentially this double portion this preeminence the right leadership everything the throne is going to go to the firstborn now that sounds kind of scary doesn't it if the first born's not up to Snuff so it says in verse 18 if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son it's no coincidence that these are joined together it basically says if a man in in verse 18 if a man have a son that won't grow up right if the young and won't grow up if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chasen him will not hearken unto him them what is Paul drawing from in Hebrews 12 what is it that he's looking at in Galatians 3 in Galatians 4 these very things that the firstborn is to receive a double portion he is the beginning of strength and the right of the firstborn is his but just because he has this right if a man have even a firstborn son who stubborn and rebellious and will not obey and when they've corrected him they tried to train him he still won't listen then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him I'm going to lay a hold on you boy and bring them out into the Elders of this city and into the gates of his place very interesting scene we saw it earlier in Deuteronomy 25 wherein the the Widow brings the brother before the Elders of the city says he will not perform the duty of his brothers of his brother to bring us forth seed to bring forth a son and in the presence of the elders and this man is called the one whose house of the house whose shoe has been loosed and we referred to the law of adoption in the Old Testament brother B said they'll take the son before the Elders of the city and there they would perform a ceremony in the public and they would put a robe on them in the ring and said this is my son and this day I'm going to adopt him and he's been my son from birth but today I'm placing him now this scene we can see in the the the Shadow or the antitype right here in Deuteronomy 21 this is is the law of adoption but we can say the son who can't be adopted the son who won't be adopted the son who won't listen he's brought to the same place before the Elders of his city under the Gate of his place and they shall say unto the Elders of City this our son is a stubborn is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard kind of calls those two things out he will not obey he's stubborn remember these things stubborn and rebellious those two things are quite large modifiers of one's character and behavior he's stubborn and rebellious he won't listen he's a glutton and a drunkard he's selfish he eats to satisfy his flesh he drinks to stimulate himself he's not worried about wisdom he's not worried about Justice he's not worried about um discipline and all the men of the city shall Stone him with stones that he die wow now why would they do this so that thou shalt put even away from among you and all Israel shall hear and fear this answers to verse 17 a son's going to be given a double portion the son's going to receive some inheritance he's going to receive something of this land he's going to receive some possession he's the builder of the family name and I know this is very staggering that they're going to take a stubborn and rebellious son and stone him and if it pertained to the men guess what there'd be a church full of women here wishing there was a preacher who could preach because there wouldn't be a son survive in this day and age there wouldn't have been one of us that wouldn't have one time been considered stubborn and rebellious and he took this son and in the presence of the elders they stoned him to death to put away evil because that's how precious the inheritance was how important the name was this is what God's wanting to reflect even in the cruelty and the of the law and this Taskmaster this our son is rebellious he won't listen and he stands to receive at the very minimum of gift he's the first son a double portion and all that he has the right of the firstborn is his but we will not let a stubborn and rebellious firstborn live long enough to receive it is that not how it reads it says and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death he he be put to death and thou hang him in a tree and he be to be put to death and thou hang him in a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but Thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is a cursed of God this is what the scripture refers to in the New Testament cursed is he who hangs on a tree isn't it amazing that he that is committed a sin Worthy of death is to be hung upon a tree his body is to not remain till uh to through the night but he's to be taken down and buried who who who who do we know that this happens to this is Christ the innocent one the firstborn who takes the punishment for we who are stiff necked stubborn and rebellious the firstborn who was a true son a good son the right son proved to be the right kind of son he La was laid upon him all of our sins all our stubborness all our Rebellion and upon him who hangs upon this tree is cursed to God that th thy land be not defiled which the Lord God lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance why is it God's so concerned Why is that the law speaks of these things because God gave you this land as an inheritance and a stubborn and rebellious son Can Lose It Go in the hands of a Philistine go in the hand of somebody else squander and waste and completely defile and ruin the inheritance and it's exactly the image you see in the New Testament where God gave him this land and because of Disobedience it's conquered by other nations Babylonian captivity time and time again the rights and authority and inheritance that these Sons had because of their negligence the Bible says they lost it for themselves and for their family the law of adoption the law of the firstborn the right of the firstborn has a caveat and has a clause that says but if he's stubborn and rebellious he's not to inherit though he is the firstborn if he doesn't learn obedience by the things which he suffered if he isn't made perfect then he's not going to assume all that is rightfully his though he be the Lord of all he's under tutors and governors but if he stubbor in rebellious and doesn't listen to the tutors and governors then the father's not going to Grant to him all that he's desires and all that he could be given as a matter of fact the Bible says he's to be stoned to death in Genesis chter 49:3 Ruben Thou Art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength and the Excellency of the Dig of dignity and the Excellency of power this is the firstborn but verse four unstable is water Thou shalt not Excel what wait what the firstborn my might the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity the Excellency of power this is what the firstborn is to be this is what we see in Christ this is what Reuben was to be but then this pronouncement you're unstable as water you're not going to excel you're not going to receive this Excellency of dignity you're not going to receive all this excellen of power though you were my might my beginning strength you will not Excel because you are unstable how because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then defil us thou it he went up to my couch says this in Genesis 35: 22 and 23 and it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land that Reuben went and lay with belha his father's concubine in Israel heard it now the sons of Jacob were 12 verse 23 the sons of Leah Reuben Jacob's firstborn and Simeon and Levi and Judah and isachar in Zebulon Reuben was the first born he was his might and his strength but because he went up to thy father's bed because he laid with his father's concubine though he is Ruben the firstborn he lost the right of the firstborn because of his character unstable as water he lost the right of the firstborn because of his behavior the word of unstable means Reckless he was negligent he was undisciplined he couldn't be restrained and maybe we'd say today uh like hurting cats thou must not Excel like he was just a loose and flow and and couldn't be constrained he was unstable as water so he lost the right of the firstborn 1 Chronicles 5: 1 2 and 3 it says now the sons of Reuben the first born of Israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his Birthright was given under the sons of Joseph the son of Israel I want to point this out very quickly notice over and over again Ruben is mentioned as the firstborn of Israel but he is disinherited because of behavior I'm just bringing this up because I think it's important to note there's some that argue that Cain is not mentioned as the firstborn of Adam because of his misbehavior he's not mentioned as the firstborn of Adam because he's not the firstborn of Adam had he been the firstborn of Adam he still would have been mentioned as the son of Adam but disinherited because of behavior because it's the pattern that God follows with Reuben so Cain is not mentioned as Adam's son because he was not Adam's son Reuben the firstborn of Israel is disinherited because of behavior but yet he's still considered the firstborn unless there be any confusion he says yes he's the firstborn but his Birthright he the right of B the first born was his the right of the first born belonged to Reuben but it was given to Joseph because he defiled his father's bed and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright so even though he's first in order that right he would have had as the oldest son is not to be reckoned to him verse two for Judah prevailed above his Brethren and of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was Joseph's it could have been all Ruben Prophet priest king possession all of it could been rubben but because of his Disobedience it's it's separated out to Joseph gets the birthright and The Possession to Judah he's going to be the king to the Levites he's going to be priest and it's separated out so because of Disobedience do you catch this because of Disobedience what one has a right to they could lose he's a son he was the firstborn of Israel to him belonged the Excellency of dignity the Excellency of power but he was stable as water he was undisciplined he had bad character and therefore Isaac would not Israel would not see this Birthright go to Reuben he would not let Reuben be the chief ruler in 1st Samuel chapter 15 verses 17 to 23 I can't remember what part we've been in here recently when we were looking looking at the example of Saul and these these different types in the scripture but Saul after he disobeyed Samuel remember Deuteronomy 21 that if a son will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and when he's chastened he will not hearken unto them he calls him a stubborn and rebellious son he says wherefore then thou did not wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord but did us fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord wait why did you do this and Saul said unto Samuel yay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought AAG the king of amalec and have utterly destroyed the amalekites his own sentence condemns him so notice what kind of King he is notice what kind of man he has notice what kind of Integrity he has or lack of integrity and in these it was in The Big Three now remember the big three what we were ministering on in those things and here's Saul representing the the this this sinful tendency oh I've obeyed I've done the right thing this popularity but then admitting he hasn't killed the king of amalec he hasn't destroyed uh utterly destroyed all of them he said but the people took the spoil sheep and ox and the chief of things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice the Lord thy God in gilgal it's almost as if he understood the the assignment but he's just making excuses now and Samuel said hath the Lord his great delight and burnt offer offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry wow these are the marks of an unruly child this is what would cause a firstborn to be disinherited this is what would cause a young to be stoned and to never receive what was rightfully his and here a king in power has chosen Rebellion has chosen to be stubborn because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King not from being a son he rejected him from being a king because he did not obey the voice of the father he did not obey the voice of the prophet he did not obey the instructions he was stubborn he was rebellious he consistently did this we see later that Saul is still promised Paradise but he lost the throne because of his character now not only did he lose the throne he lost it for Jonathan when it was taken away from Saul it was taken away from his first born Jonathan would have been King had Saul had the right kind of character and integrity to preserve The Inheritance to his children's children but not being of the right kind of character he did not lose his sunship but he lost his throne because of Disobedience and I use this to demonstrate that a disobedient son could Mar a family's inheritance it could Mar a right to a throne it could squander power it could squander and sell the land so the law provided a way so that that her inheritance could be preserved even so much that if a man sold it it could be redeemed back if one sold himself he could be redeemed back why it's the law of God and a stubborn and rebellious son was stoned under the law so that a stubborn and rebellious son the sin of Witchcraft and that which is Iniquity and idolatry would not be joined to the name of that house the house would not be marred by a poor testimony would not be marred by poor example it would not be uh joined up with that which was wicked so a stubborn and rebellious son was stoned under the law but under grace he's disinherited he said well what do you mean he loses something and Hebrews 12: 22 and 23 it says but ye are com un Mount Zion un the city of the Living God to the Heavenly Jerusalem into an inumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn who are these firstborn they're written in heaven and you've come to the god to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect all children of God are firstborn children God has no grandchildren but this is the uniqueness of God's design and his plan all children are firstborn waiting for Paul said the adoption the Holy Ghost itself the spirit buried witness of the earnest given as an Earnest of the fullness of redemption the full inheritance so all as children of God are viewed scripturally and in this type and in this way to understand God's nature it is we are all firstborn waiting the fullness of the inheritance the Church of firstborns and it is our Rel our relationship to God can never be lost if you are a son he's not going to say one day well today you're not my son you see you I just thought to do 23 and me before they go bankrupt and I'm sorry buddy I know I was your father and I was your God and it was kind of this really cool thing we had going on here for a while but turns out you're not my son it'll never happen you are a son you are a daughter but there are things that you can lose I'd like to close with just a few scriptures and and if you are so inclined I can't remember what parts it was but I think it was last year we preach on judgment and rewards and we spent a lot of time on the reward aspect in a son in this very context but we didn't look at it in detail of the firstborn but we looked in the message of the hour when brother was preaching hear ye him and he said over and over again he had a right to The Inheritance but he didn't inherit it if his character was bad right and he teaches that time and time again let me use this as an image to close on in 2 Chronicles 21: 1 2 and 3 and Jehosaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David and jehoram his son reigned in his stead in place of him Jehoshaphat was on the throne he's King and when he dies now his son is raised up in his dead he's there in place of and the same Rank and authority and profile and everything of his father and he had Brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat Azariah and jahil and Zachariah and Azariah and Michael and shathah all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel they were all Sons but only one went to the throne can you think of the image now that God wants to share Christ wants to share even his throne with us that to sit with him in his throne as he has sat down in his father's Throne this image we see in Christ in the New Testament draws from all these images we saw in the Old Testament and their Earthly means to understand a very Supernatural principle where God who was the invisible and intangible wanted to become tangible and a king and queen with co-ee equalness together he wanted to become this family wanted to become this household and this is God's way of achieving it he had a lot of other Sons but verse three and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fent cities in Judah and God can give all sorts of gifts just as Abraham gave gifts to the sons of concubines and he pours out his Spirit upon All Flesh and he gives gifts unto men and there can be all sorts of gifts and all sorts of Frolic but the kingdom gave he to Jarome because he was the firstborn it's the firstborn that gets the kingdom it's the firstborn that he doesn't get the fence cities and churches and silver and gold and gifts and all those things but he gets everything he gets to rain in his throne and in 2 John verse 8 it says look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward I just don't want the gifts of silver and gold and precious things I I don't just want fent cities in Judah I want the kingdom it's the god the father's pleasure to give you the kingdom I don't want just to I don't want to lose those things which I have wrought but I want to receive a full reward and let me read this statement to back up the dozens of places where brother bam says it he says it may seem hard to beginning but God knows what he's doing this is in sermon spiritual adoption sure he knows what he's doing the training the teaching the correcting may seem hard but he knows what he's doing then as the Holy Spirit brings begins to bring word that if the child has not been obedient when it becomes of maturity the age of maturity in other words when it's old but not mature when he's old I mean he's old enough he should be king but at the time that you're old enough and been in this message long enough and you've been doing this long enough when you ought to be teachers you become like goooo Gaga again he says when he comes to the age of maturity then the child is always a son certainly but it loses something it's the law of adoption in the Old Testament you'll find it in the law of the firstborn the right of the firstborn is his you're always a son you're always a daughter you're a child of God you're a young and the spirit of God moves you respond to it but as you grow and those roots go down deep you've got to come to a place of fruit you've got to come to a place of maturity if not you'll never lose your salvation you'll never lose your relationship to God but you lose something and I don't think it's necessary to focus on what's lost and and the negative side and some say well you said when the youngans don't grow up whenever you going to answer that well I'll do it on a Wednesday night just one service because the rest is what we should be looking forward to Revelations 3:11 it says behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast your right to Redemption your right to Excellency your right to dignity your right to power all that is going to be granted to you all things hold on to it that which I H that no man take thy Crown if our musicians would come to their instruments I thought I had it in here I'm realizing now I took a lot of it out but remember how that or maybe I just skipped right over it I don't know maybe it's in here somewhere but Esau was the first born and as the first born he had a Birthright and with that Birthright came blessing and one day Esau was hungry and he asked Jacob for some food Jacob saw an opportunity and said well give me the right that a firstborn has give me all your rights that you have as being the first one they're both sons essentially born at the same time right the hill Grabber came out they're born very close to one another uh in in time they're twins but the one who's born first the one that divides the one that comes forth you'll find that in the scripture in the law as it's granted this one is the one that pertained he got the double portion he was the one to be raised up in uh in Isaac's stead and so Jacob says well give me that right of the firstborn and Esau's like well what good is it to me if I die going to be yours anyways so he sells it to him and then Jacob despi or Esau despised that right that the firstborn had because he knew he'd given it to Jacob story gets even more more amazing when Isaac comes to a place where he wants to bless Esau Rebecca overhears it and says pretend to be Jacob pretend to be Esau and give him his Venice and meal and as Esau's out hunting Jacob walks in he's like Jacob is that you or Esau he's like yes it's me he's like well you don't sound like Esau let me feel you and and he gives him the blessing and as soon as the blessing's been conferred on Isaac Jacob Jacob steals Esau's blessing now he has the birth right now he has the blessing and what's the question are Who Who Are You Esau and he goes well I I'm your firstborn this is what he says I'm your firstborn I'm the one to whom the blessing pertains and Esau laments not only did he get my the right of the firstborn but now he's taking the blessing with it and this idea of the firstborn let's just read through this again quickly in Hebrews 12: 1-1 17 wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness says let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds remember Esau was faint he was weary when he showed up that day at that campsite says you have not yet resisted under blood striving against sin and have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chasing of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth for if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not remember in Deuteronomy when we're reading there how that the son was disobedient it says our son Deuteronomy 21 our son he may be our firstborn but he won't listen and we've chastened him and we've corrected him he still won't hearken why were they doing it because he stood to receive something but if you be without chastisement where of all are partakers then are you bastards and not Sons you don't have an inheritance furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and gave them reverence shall we not much better much rather be in subjection of the father's spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness there's The Inheritance this is what he grants now no chastening for the present seem to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord let me just put it this way unless you're bearing that image nobody's going to see it it's this grace of God and this peace and Holiness which we bear which we carry which portrays and reflects the car character of God if we don't have it no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of been is springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicate or profane person as Esau what a amazing striking admonishment in the middle of this who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright because of some craving something in the flesh through stubborn and iniquity through one morsel of meat he's profane fornicator he's included with he sold his right of the firstborn for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears let us not make the same mistake that Esau had did now we can't be Esau's we can't be disinherited in the sense that we don't receive salvation we can't be disinherited in the sense that we don't receive eternal life but brother bam teaches us very very clearly when the young don't grow up they do lose something and I want us to be passionate about serving God passionate about bearing Holiness and following peace with all men and looking diligently lest we fail the grace of God making sure that there's no root of bitterness springing up that would trouble us and defile others let us not be a fornicator or profane person let us not be stubborn or rebellious but let us yield to the Master's tender hand listen to the things he's trying to to teach us lean into this fall into this message with everything that's in us live this word correctly and one day God's going to give you all that is yours if we could stand together and pray the Bible tells us when the young on don't grow up they lose something I want to be sure that I don't lose my crown and I want Lord with all that's in me I don't want to lose my reward our gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight as we close this service Lord I trust that there's in this brief look into the Old Testament to see the right of the firstborn and how that because there was the right of the firstborn there was a process to bring that son to a place to receive what is rightfully his and because the land is so precious and the name is so precious and the household so precious and all these things so important in your image and in your type as the antitype Lord you provided in the word in the law a way that a rebellious and stubborn son would not Mar The Inheritance Lord if in some way a son did and and he lost it and he squandered it Lord there was a way to redeem those things back not the gifts the gold the silver and all that could be just wasted away but the name the house the land the kingdom [Music] and Lord as we see Adam losing it and forfeiting it we are told the land will not be sold forever and you sent forth your son the firstborn to redeem it all back lord this beautiful picture and beautiful image speaks to us now as Sons and Daughters of God Paul instructs Us in Galatians he brings it up in Romans we see it throughout the New Testament this process of growing into your very image because we are firstborn and Lord I think it in my heart as I look at it I know it occupies a very small place in the word in terms of the attention given to it but Lord I believe it's good for us just to take some time to gaze upon this aspect that you said don't let another man take your crown be sure that we don't lose our reward and Paul warns the Church of the firstborn to not make the mistake that Esau did I believe Lord we can't lose our position in you as far as a son or daughter Lord there's certain things that were granted certain privileges that we'll have as your sons these gifts the possessions but Lord the kingdom and all that therein pertains to it the throne and these different rights to the firstborn Lord I I confess today that I haven't been the right kind of a son Lord I confess that I've been a glutton I've been a drunkard I confess Lord that I've been stubborn and rebellious but Lord please don't give up on me keep teaching me Lord keep instructing me Lord chastise me Lord I I'm listening father I want to grow out of my immaturities I want to rise up above my insecurities Lord I want to I want to overcome the the the needs the wants of the flesh Lord I don't want to be an Esau who just sell out in a moment because I'm thirsty God help us Lord I pray for all of us here today that we would not be a young and that doesn't grow up that we wouldn't come to what would be the age of maturity and find that we can't receive all our inheritance but Lord may we be that obedient son in the gate that the father can say this is my son today today I confer and bless all to him we commend ourselves to you tonight Lord pray your blessing upon your people Lord I Thank you for each one sister Rebecca playing the piano brother Phillip leading songs and brother Elliot on the Cahone sister Hannah singing a special and even brother Eli's opening prayer and just those that take up the offering and brother Mitch and brother John on the sound just everyone who takes part Lord I Thank you for them God what a great privilege it is to serve in this house may we just bind closer together Lord May none of us feel disconnected May none of us just feel like we're on the fringes Lord and even if we some Miss some services and they're they're streaming I mean Lord and though there's other families that are moving and other families finding their place in other assemblies Lord we just Rejoice to see that Sons and Daughters of God are finding their place but for us Lord here now may we be faithful to that which youve called us to shake us Lord that we just bind ourselves closer together let these roots go down deep may your spirit be free to move amongst us Lord we ask all these things name the Lord Jesus Christ amen
