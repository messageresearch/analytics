TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I will raise them up a prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee and I will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not arken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of him but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet Prophet has spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him May the blessing upon his word you can be seated amen praise the Lord I want to start on the prophet test and I hope to move quickly into the the the main topic this morning we're going to speak about the greatest purpose we've just read this scripture that was consider the prophet test so if a prophet speaks and he's he's he's whatever he says doesn't come to pass the Lord says I have not spoken right and it's been used many times as to try to to figure out to to vindicate is is a man a prophet or he's not and there is you know there's some controversies and especially lately and I feel Liberty to speak a little bit about it because I was here on Wednesday night and brother Aaron kind of mentioned it so I felt like uh it'd be okay so we had a little bit of a situation back home where people start questioning so was he really a prophet or did did everything he say fulfilled and is that set the Lord ever fail and and they go into that I call it a rabbit hole trying to study and try to investigate and try to go into path and try to dig the the archive and try to figure out can we trust this man or not and they put everything on this this this this scripture of infallibility right that he never made a mistake and if suddenly they think he made a mistake and and now you got to become a you got to become like a journalist an investigative journalist and you got to become an expert like a a bridge engineer and you got to become this and you got to become that trying to figure out if your faith is solid if was built on the right thing or not and and I and I feel that this this is a trap and I want to lace a couple of scriptures this morning as when we try to put everything on infallibility we missed the point yeah when we try to build our faith upon how a man was perfect we missed a point and when those people goes in that rabbit hole suddenly they want to disqualify a prophet but when they keep that same spirit and mindset then they're going to end up disqualifying the Bible because why how do you believe this Bible are you an archaeologist yeah have you discovered that Moses was really in Egypt yeah or they re erase all his record was he really there or did he did he wrote everything about what happened in isra in Egypt and all did he write it after the fact well yes he did and so you want to follow so did Abraham says they would surge in like 400 years maybe it was 43 so was he right or wrong Y and what you want to follow that trail of trying to scientifically prove your faith it's it's a rabbit hole now the other test and brother you don't it's not it's okay if you keep the slides activated for me it's okay so the other the that uh uh when we're talk about a prophet uh it says here if there's arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a Wonder to sign of the one if and the sign or the Wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods so now you have a man who makes a prophecy and it's fulfilled so if we use the first test is like if if he says something and it happens you should listen to him but now you got another scripture says if he says something and it happens now you got to listen what's the message behind the sign because that's also important what is he saying what is he pointing at and so here it looks like a trap because now you got a man who has a sign he has wonders and it's exactly like you know um how do you call it those two gbr um how do you say it yeah those two that went against Moses JJ JJ yeah JJ from Egypt but both of them did the same sign but their message were different yep those did the same sign but JJ's voice was stay in Egypt it's business as usual don't pay attention to that yeah they did a great sign we can do the same thing but the the voice behind the sign was remain as you are stay worthy yeah as Moses message is Lee come out of her my people there's a Promised Land amen and so here this other test it says the sign the Wonder come to pass whereever he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou Hast not known and let us serve them Thou shalt not aren unto the words of that Prophet or that dreamer dreams for the Lord your God proveth you to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul amen ye shall walk after the the Lord your God and fear Him and keep his commandment and obey his voice and he shall serve him and cleave unto him and that Prophet or that dreamer of Dreams shall be put to death because he had spoken to turn you away from the Lord Our God and so just a fact that somebody didn't do any mistake in his prophecy does not totally vindicate him because you have to listen to what he's pointing at it's studying that topic lately because I was trying to help those people they were confused and they try to investigate and they try to know for sure and we got to study those things it's really important and I was I was trying to wrap my head around what's what's the thought and why why it they would be scandalized by that and I realized that their old premises was that they built on the infab infallibility of a man that he never make any mistake and everything is perfect and everybody got everybody got healed and suddenly it's like you know a castle Who falls apart because their faith was not built on the right thing and in studying that I came I was I was working with another Pastor on the topic and try to study and then he used a scripture that really strike me and and it's it's kind of the basis of our sermon this morning and it's in 1 John chapter 4 and I call it the New Testament test and the Bible says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world so this is the New Testament test prophet and it's not just prophets you want to test you want to test because there's a lot of spirits and they want to talk they want to say something there's so many influencers there's so many voices out there everybody has a channel everybody say subscribe everybody says follow me but we can remember who said follow me first Jesus said follow me amen so verse two it kind of tells you how to approach this hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confessed that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and that this is that Spirit of the Antichrist wherefore ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world I've I'll be honest with you I've overlooked that scripture for too long but lately I've died into that scripture and it it it came to life for me because I always wondered there's so many churches out there that will say that Jesus Christ came in flesh right I would say that most church I would say that even the the Catholic Church would recognize that Jesus Christ live on earth and he came in flesh and so if that's the sign that this that that that that that vindicate a voice or vindicates a minister there's a lot of people who will say Jesus Christ came in the flesh so what is it really many church can point to you a a story called Jesus Christ their sermon built will be built on History like what Paul did this and he went in that City and he traveled that long and he met that person and all the the the the the angle of the sermon is based on historical event and they will not deny that Jesus Christ came in flesh but they will put everything in the past and it suddenly it dawn on me that the spirit of Christ the spirit of God how do we know that it's the spirit of God that is talking is that it does not deny the manifestation of Jesus Christ in the flesh present tense because the Trap is always to point back to something God has done in the past but that's not the sign that the spirit of God is talking the sign that the spirit of God is talking who to recognize that he not I was or I will be but I am and the spirit that can recognize the manifestation of Jesus Christ this morning is the spirit of God yes amen that's good amen and so to prove that this scripture is talking about that the next verse says ye are of God little children and I've overcome them because greater is he that is that is in you than he that is in the world so John is recognizing not only God in Jesus Christ or God in Moses or God in Paul but God in you yes amen and it this is how we recognize that the spirit of God is present and this is how you test a Prophet this is how you test a minister this is how you test every voice are they pointing you as a past Revival who are they pointing you at the Manifest of Jesus Christ today January 2025 God is on the move this morning all right so this is our foundation introduction is done so we can start right prise the Lord so before we move on we want to maybe kind of put it into context in our age we understand that in this hour and I don't have time to dwell to explain it all if if whatever I say is brought bring some question you have a wonderful student Pastor well verse you can ask question is somebody rubs against or does not align with what this church believe it's okay as well don't throw me into garbage just get rid of the seed and keep eating amen it was said that Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished or means accomplish reveal as he has declared to his servant servants the prophets and a lot of time we we see that word as Mysteries but it's not Mysteries like we got a lot of more knowledge about many things many Mysteries got open but it's the mystery of God and when we want to summarize everything we've received in our age when we want to summarize to to the most simple expression of what the message was is that the mystery of God is finished but what is the mystery Bible question Bible answer obviously we for that we got to turn into Colossians chapter one and before he have you I know you're well acquainted with that scripture but before even Paul reveals what the mystery is already verse 24 he's giving us some Clues right because what he's saying he says who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body sake which is the church so Paul is saying that the Affliction of Christ is now in his body that he's finishing the the Affliction that Christ suffered and it it looks like like how dare you Paul Christ suffer on the cross it was complete and I'm not talking about suffering for the atonement but the the there is suffering for the body but now the body is not the body of Jesus anymore it's not his flesh anymore now the church is his body and Christ is in her and he so how bold can Paul could would say the Affliction of Christ is now in my flesh yeah but he's he's telling us something something is going somewhere with that so it says whereof I have made a minister according to the dispens dispens dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now it's made manifest to his Saints and so it it doesn't make it like a small thing but he makes it the mystery yes yes hid from age and from Generations how many Rabbi read the Old Testament and and and studied they spent their whole life and they miss what was hidden Christ was veil in the in the Old Testament but they missed it because he's hiding himself but reveals himself in Simplicity to whom God who made known that is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen so that mystery of Revelation 10:7 is complete in that mystery Paul says was hid from generation from ages right and I believe we're all on the same page for that yes it's not I'm not trying to bring something new I'm trying to use this to go a little bit further sir this morning thank you Lord so the sign the the New Testament Prophet test is the spirit of God when that spirit of God speaks he will put the manifestation of Christ in the flesh of somebody amen amen and people always been good to recognize the manifestation of Christ in past tense right and it's always been the problem from from from ages from ages from prophets to Prophet from church age to church ages they were always miss they will always praise God for what he did but they would miss what God is doing and it's exactly the role of the Antichrist to Blind you to the present manifestation of Christ and make you appreciate a past manifestation of Christ right sometime we believe the spirit of antichrist is like something really satanic or witchcraft no is to put Christ in past tense that's all all you need to bring spiritual death so when you want to summarize the ministry of a man we receive a prophet in our age and people are trying to prove him right prove him wrong based on archaeologist and and and newspaper clipping and and and bridge bridge engineering and and they try to prove him and there missed the whole point right all we have to do is to try to figure out if I summarize that man's Ministry what was the climax of what he was trying to do when he said that this is the Pinnacle of my Ministry yeah that Christ coming down and that would reveal the mystery and that he the the the the first pull the second pull that coming into the third pull to bring you where to bring you to what manifestation I would say boldly that if we want to summarize this ministry this verse summarize the ministry of the Prophet is to point Christ now into bride and if if and when we realize and I will show you quickly um you Brothers can you make me a big jump to slide 22 please I never know what order it's going to be uh slide 22 let me move one forward this one the pacle of his ministry when he preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed and now we're getting into our topic the greatest purpose yes and when he summarized the three great purposes of God hidden from ages and generations the first one he says the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people and we believe he did amen yes sir but now the second purpose is to have the Christ Christ wants to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is bright that he might live in people so now you tie it back to first John 4 this is how we recognize a true Prophet this is how we recognize the true spirit of God is that it will introduce it will point to Jesus Christ in the flesh yes and a lot of people have seen Jesus Christ manifested manifested in in the prophet's Ministry and we all appreciate that but if it stopped there you've missed a whole point yes because it went through him but he wants to reach you in your life and so when it's time to summarize the greatest purpose so if if if the prophet reveals those three great purposes of God it means that that was his purpose too and if a man if a man who we call a prophet if we can't point to the Pinnacle if we summarize his old purpose of why he was sent on Earth and it was to point to Christ and the bride what are you afraid of we don't need to become an archaeologist we don't need to be an investigative journalist to be expert in what happened then and this and that because we can safely said that safely say that depend goal of his ministry was to point you to Christ for you to have a closer relationship with Christ so that Christ could be manifested in your life [Applause] today God the third is to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adom back to where he walked into the cool of the evening with his people talk with them and fellowship with them so the her all purpose of God and the all purpose of the prophet's Ministry is to restore the connection between the people in Christ that he could be in you Jesus says those who believe in me they shall do the same works that I do it's now it's about you and Christ the prophet has fulfilled his ministry he has done his work God took him home and now Christ wants to say what about time to do something together yes right hallelujah thank you Lord even Revelation 1010 it says when he took the little book out of the Angel's hand and he ate it up and the prophet says that book is Christ but he had to eat it so it means Christ in us the bride us to eat the book amen and that book is The Book of Life it's the word it's Christ the prophet says he says Christ opened those seals he says Christ was those seal it's a person not information and when sometime people they want to understand the seals and they're trying to understand the information there's information links to the seal we know the horse rider this this and that but when you want to summarize the seal it's a person revealing itself and the bride has to take that person in and that is the purpose of that Ministry amen hallelujah amen so I took the little book and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and soon as I eaten up my belly was bitter so it's Christ in you the hope of glory even Paul even even Paul when he wanted to point at his message he didn't point to letters he didn't point to ink and paper right but when it was time to point to his message when it was time to point to his ministry we we noce scripture he says ye are persons ye are our epistle written Amen in our hearts known and and read of all men for so much such as ye are manifestly manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart Yes again you have a prophet you have a man of God and where is he pointing Jesus Christ is he pointing him himself Paul says we're not preaching ourselves we are preaching Christ and our ministry Christ now is in my message is you yes amen we had new people coming this summer and they enjoyed the people they enjoyed the preaching they enjoy everything about the atmosphere they those new people they recognize Christ in our midst and they fell in love with us and suddenly they start to realize that we believe in a prophet and brother brandham and then they went on the web and then they they got scared yeah yeah it scary with they're saying these days and so they left and I told the church I said you know what when they fell in love with you for what you represent yeah the atmosphere in the church to preaching of the word they loved everything I says when they did that they they fell in love with the message right because we are the manifestation Christ in us now is the message because it's present tense yes sir and even one of them wrote to me she said you're such wonderful people your fruits are so good I'm like what are you afraid of the tree then if the fruits are good like hey am but they were not they were new people so they didn't understand but it's like I always almost replied with the scripture of Matthew like where are the branches he's the tree if the fruits are good du yeah I could be poisoned by that tree but I love the fruits but then they went on the web and who wants to be part of a cult if if that's what we say it's dangerous is this is this is that so out of it ignorance but some of them now are slowly coming back cuz they say you guys have something we don't find somewhere else and we're like oh thank you what they see we should know what they see where does Steve no one preach like you over there that's what they say it's like yeah if you knew where I take it it's Christ yeah so we we want to have that ability to to recognize Christ that's why Paul didn't focus on letter and ink right right because he recognized that words need not to be made paper that word not to be made tapes it it conveyed true letters it was conveyed through tapes but the end result if it stays on paper it's a failure if it stay on tape it's a failure it has to become flesh and that this is the sign that the movement is still alive and it's from God if when we can point at Christ in the flesh not just books right we enjoy the Bible it's great but if it's stay in paper form it's a failure because the greatest purpose of God is that he wants to live in his people that's what he wants to do that's his business and it should be the business of every man that says that are called from God is to point to Christ to bring people to Christ so Christ can come in them and to live in them and so this is how we judge a Ministry this is how we judge every Spirit what are you preaching what are you pointing at amen that's right if you leave the service this morning it's like yeah brother Steve is a good preacher but it was all about himself we kind of felt we needed to listen to him we kind of felt the attraction that he he's trying to bring us like we need to go through him to get closer to God and that's kind of the what we heard from him if if if that's the if if you leave church this morning and this is this is what you got then I'm a false prophet because I'm trying to bring you to me or I'm trying to bring you to my church I'm glad they put the website on so everybody can subscribe and you follow me right I'm sorry it's all in French anyway so that's what we want to hear you know some people blame the prophet they say you brag too much about Jesus yeah that's a compliment yes Lord thank you yes amen because that's what we the one we want to praise and all right but we're not out of the woods yet because the spirit of antichrist will fight that and the spirit of the Antichrist what it will do it will remove Christ in present tense yes and will put it on a holy men either present past or future but the the most important action of that nicolan spirit is to remove the movement of the holy spirit in your life and that the only way you can have access to Christ is through the church the pastor the Prophet this this or that and it's something that comes between you and Christ that becomes so important that you don't have a straight access anymore wow so right away even when Jesus died on the cross and Peter comes and opens you know even for the Gentiles and Paul comes start preaching already he says the mystery of the iniquity do already work right you say the church is great you got free free from the Pharisees free from the law you're moving into freedom but you think that spirit will stop it doesn't stop and it didn't stop in our our age and and I believe that's a misunderstanding that we have we think that Spirit worked for all the six age but since the seals are open he went on a vacation that mystery of iniquity that nian Spirit got got defeated through the ministry of the Prophet it got defeated it's over now he got a knockout punch we don't have to worry about him anymore or is he still at work yes so what was it got to go quickly to that we know that Spirit was a saying you know it's a thought then we say it then we do it then it becomes a Doctrine and after it becomes a persecution and we can see in our age some doctrin started as a saying it started as a a ritual it started as a tradition and now if you don't do it you're not in the message right on it became a persecution it became a subject of being excommunicated right because we created new tradition new things that that are more important in Christ in my life it's Christ in my life plus this plus that plus going this plus doing that whatever men is trying to do very good and so that Nicol spiritual tradition it was recognized as a a cult you know perverted cult through Nicolai Prophet is that's not so we know about that that you know the Greek word niol so to means to conquer the ly so that Spirit wants to conquer you but conquer what we have it here also it's the first horse rider the first horse rider went to conquer so the first horse rider went to niika right to niika who you yeah me the church who got freshly freed yes from that bondage you think he you think he received a knockout punch when he he was exposed in 63 and exposed through the church age book he got a knockout punch went on vacation I'm sorry I got defeated Prophet came expose me people will never fall in that trap no so that horse went to conquer and he received a crown who gave him a crown who gave him a crown who allowed that person and now we're going to walking slowly into idolatry we're going to see how idolatry Works we're going to see a pattern in scripture it's always the people who wants to Crown often time we think about nicolan Spirit as as as you know the the the clergy you know dominating clergy this Cardinal this bishop who wants to dominate people but you know what now we would not accept that but we are going to realize is that when somebody is not forcefully trying to dominate people people are asking for someone to dominate on them exactly right Pastor tell me how to think Pastor should I go get this job Pastor should I do this please dominate my life I need to find a quote where the Prophet says verbit in what I should do please William Bram dominate on my life tell me how to think tell me should I take this job or not come on I need to find a crow who going to tell me should I do this should I do not do it but where is Christ right because maybe you can find a quote that tells you that this you know if you do this this this but what about if God leads you says God would never lead me outside of what the prophet's say and I'm not talking about clear-cut situation I'm talking about situation people are trying sometime to apply quotes to their life that doesn't apply at all they stretch it so far right but and then they hide behind the quote and you read the quote he like brother I mean I get the quote but you're applying to this I mean has nothing to do no no brother no no no no no they stretch it because they want to hide behind a man who's going to tell them how to think but where is Christ it's like Christ's not able to talk to you anymore thank you Lord so we Crown men to dominate on us it can be you sitting in church and this elder brother he has so much wisdom and he he knows knows the Bible he knows the word and you trust him so well and every time you go through a situation you call that brother brother no you know I trust you and I'm going through this what do what would you do and we got to be careful even me as a pastor when people ask me questions I always answer with another question yep yep and you know why you know what it's amazing most of the time people already had the answer in their heart amen but they don't have confidence God already so I turned the question around it's like what how do you feel like well I feel like I should do this like why you asking me then well I don't know you know you're you're a man of God well I'm no more a man of God than you are a man of God it's like my Christ's not bigger for me than it is for you it's the same one the only different is a gift I got a gift to preach but when when that gift's gone I'm just that regular joob try to make a true life and try to raise children and you ask me yeah I'm asking you yep and I don't say that a pastor cannot give good advice but most of the time my advice is based on a vision most the time I reply okay you're wondering about that choice today where do you want to be in five years and is that choice today making you closer to this purpose that God gave you in your heart or further very good people want to be dominated by law but Christ wants to lead our life by a vision I want to get close close to Christ so is that decision making me close to him or further from him amen so Paul saw coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with this false Doctrine he knew they would Implement a way of worship that exclude the people from any part in the Holy Spirit Ministry only the pastor only the prophet only the Deacon only the elders no Christ in you is accessible from the first row to the last and those that's going to come and outside of this church and inside of this church right it's accessible and even and right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the lady and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and try to absorb it this is a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in a spiritual worship yes amen what is he saying people sitting and listening to a holy man is a far cry from what brother Paul was preaching is somebody listening amen well Christ wasn't a prophet amen well Christ is when I hear tapes it blesses me amen nothing against that we're going to see as we move in we're going to see what idolatry is idolatry is not when okay Sports well Sports you know I struggle with that it always gets between me and God the music you know bad music I struggle it becomes an idol in my life because it comes between me and God but what about idolatry when that thing that be between you and God is something that God sent is that possible well we're going to study that quickly got to move on thank you Lord wow we always see idolatry as Pagan worship worshiping stuff that are from the devil but that nicadan spirit that that Antichrist spirit will make the True Believer fall in idolatry with stuff that God has sent there's a pattern in scripture for that so let me move I got to skip some of my quotes Okay okay got to move on I don't want to keep you too long so I want to talk about innate idolatry one day I was talking to brother Eugene Bron who some of you know him he's a good friend of mine and he says brother Steve we're talking about you know why people would fall for this and why would people would fall for that I was like you know brother Eugene says man it's it's unfortunate says brother Steve he says those things are there to feed the idolatry and people because idolatry is not something that comes from outside idolatry is in every man yep right and idolatry is when you want to replace Christ when you want tol God by some accessories or some other thing than Christ himself you remember my opening scripture one of the opening scripture the true test as we test the spirit of God is the one the one that denies Jesus Christ in the flesh is the Antichrist but the one that recognized Jesus Christ in the flesh is of God that's the ultimate test so let's talk about idolatry for a minute of course when we talk about idolatry we're talking about Graven image lord said you know th shalt not have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Gren image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that CU God knew that men by that that sinful nature they are idolators they would always come up with a fish a beast this the sun whatever God has created these all those Idols they the the sculpure they make yeah was things that God created sure but God knew that they would fall for them and so he says Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God I am a jealous God so he says don't do that even in the Book of Luke and it's still in French and Jesus answered unto him get the behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shallal thou serve praise the Lord and one of the greatest asset we have is time and we serve things with our time so right away they come out of Egypt and the prophet disappeared oh does the people doesn't like when the prophet go away right oh they don't like it they feel so discomforted they feel so insecure it's like this emptiness I got to feel it the prophet's gone what will I do the prophet's gone exactly what happened to Israel in the desert Moses went up the mountain and heate to come down the mount so the people gathered themselves together around the ministry around Aaron and said unto him make us Gods which shall go before us for us for this Moses the men that brought us up out the land of Egypt we were not what is become of him so right away they followed a prophet of God out of Egypt through the desert and then that Prophet goes up the mountain and then he disappear and right away the people are asking cuz Aaron and the Levites are the type of the ministry they're asking the ministry build us an idol an idol we want to worship something put an image in front of us so we can follow something and Aaron's reply should have been why you guys asking that right God just God himself just took us out of Egypt it was not Moses it was God and even though Moses is gone we don't know if he's going to return God is still here the one who brought you but their eyes were not on God their eyes was on Moses so when Moses got away they needed an image right they need something tangible Pastor give me something to do tell me what to worship and they were missing God in the camp cuz the pillar fire was still in the camp God does not abandon his children glory to God thank you Lord but right away they wanted to be replaced and it's so funny when you you read Aaron because he said you know I brought those gold and melted and it came this uh C calf right yeah it came like yeah right yeah sounds like Evolution right yeah suddenly you know there's a monkey you know but he fell for that and the ministry was guilty to instead of replying to the people instead of telling the church we will not fall into idolatry the ministry went along and gave what the people wanted build us an image we can follow right even when it was time to go on the mountain God wanted to speak thally to Israel and God had made an appointment with the people God wanted to meet Israel face to face that's the ultimate purpose remember the greatest purpose of God he wants to be in you he wants to restore Fellowship as Adam had that's what he want and that is not like in the Millennium you can have a relationship with Christ now he's accessible there's no there's nobody in between it's you and Christ he wants to lead you he wants to channel himself through you thank you Lord Jesus praise the lord we had a youth meeting lately and I've asked them what's what's the message to you in a simple sentence and they were all nervous and I've asked the church the same thing in a sentence if you summarize what is the message to you write it down and I'll say I'll give you some cues I don't want to offend anybody but I said if your answer what is the message if your answer is the further in past tense it is the colder you are wow in time but also in distance yes if it's further in time and far away from your you as a human being right your answer as as far as time and distance your answer is wrong but the closer your answer is to you that's the answer because the answer is that's the message the ultimate is Christ in me the hope of glory but many people would say God sent a prophet so you look at the distance a prophet's gone and it's it's it's how many years ago it's past tense it's all great but that came for Christ to come in your life so the ultimate purpose so I said and I gave the example you meet somebody at work and he's sick and maybe some of you recognize you say oh you're sick Wednesday so future tense I will put put a prayer request at church and a holy man in my church will pray for you so you put it in distance in time and it's going to be another person who's going to do it for you and I said you you can still bring requests to church the point is not that's not wrong but I say what if you say to that person can I pray for you now then it's close to you the Manifest the action of God is close to you in time and in distance and that's the whole purpose of God he wants to use you now for that person yes this Helder or even the pastor who's going to sometime even people are like brother Steve you should meet my coworker you should talk to him and says I'm not doing that God plac you at that work trust that Christ will give you the words cuz he wants to use you he's using the pastor and sometime when we preach like that people are offended like he talked against the prophet all service that's not the point right well cuz I'm not I'm talking about myself I'm telling the people God I know where God wants to use me but he wants to use you why do you think you ended up at that school cuz he wants to use you but sometime we feel I wish my pastor was in school with me so he could talk to that person it's a lack of faith it's a lack of trust it's a lack of recognizing our position and when we feel this way we make our pastor and Idol right because he's going to replace the manifestation of God in your life through him where God called you to do it and not your pastor and that is idolatry that's the TR thank you Lord Brother the bride has to recognize our position she has to recognize that the all greatest purpose of God is he wants to be in you and for you to do the same Works he did amen well brother Steve I never prayed for anybody no problem but it's a good time to start I'll give you a testimony of my wife my wife goes to the grocery the other day and she leaves the grocery and I think it's in the parking lot or the entrance something there's a biker you know with the look you know my wife was intimidated cuz she says he's he was at Hell's Angels like I'm not sure he was Hell's Angel that group but that's how she felt yeah and my wife she's you know all little and so and he's like that and he's struggling with his breath he has something an issue his heart we don't know she doesn't know what it is then she stops she says are you okay sir said no I don't feel good my son went to get some help and she's Ling says okay you're going to be good and then she leaves and then when she leaves the Lord stops in her track is like go pray for him no that's a more probably a guy you know tattooed and Hell's Angels maybe a murderer and I'm just little you know little sister you know but she couldn't you know when the Holy Ghost gets a hold of you come on maybe she go maybe she couldn't call me Steve you have to come there's a man we need need prayer for her I like oh she didn't call me she turned back and she went to him she said can I pray for you amen he says yeah so my wife laid her hand on this motor guy motorbike and guy and then everybody like it was in the middle of the entrance so people stop and respectfully watch while my wife was praying for him this is just a little example but if you want to summarize the first pool second pool the third pool The Profit the seals the this the that people get lost you know I'm wondering what tape should I listen to do I listen enough i r do I go to the right Church like stop stop giving yourself a break yeah Christ is in you he wants to use you to God thank you Lord we get lost in religion right we're in danger of making another religion right come on now true we're in great danger Hallelujah so when God wanted to speak directly not true Moses you wanted to bypass the prophet you know what the people said they said unto Moses let not we don't want God to speak to us what oh I'm intimidated you know you might reject me I understand you know the mountain the the lightning the tunders it was pretty frightening quite intimidating but we don't need lightning Thunders and trumpet we are intimidating intimidated by that me praying for someone that's cool me praying for someone yeah God wants to use you and is that is it not the na human nature they said let not God speak not to us but let the prophet we just want to hear the prophet we don't want to hear God that's right and the Bible says the people stood afar they stood away from God to get close to the prophet because they felt secure I'm going to stick with the prophet man that's the safe way to go that's how they fell and then people get it reverse like brother St is saying we should stay away with the prophet that's not what I said I said don't stay away from God that's what I'm saying yes using a prophet to hide yourself all right let's take a few example of of idolatry they're pretty shocking the Brazen serpent you know one day in numbers 21 the Lord sent fiery serpent among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died and therefore people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpent from us Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looked upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole so we read a scripture not long ago that God says don't do any Graven image yep and now he's making one exactly does God contradict himself no God told the people don't do one yep but now God asked for one right it's a different thing it didn't come from man it come from God and I so we understand it's the type of the Cross God is saying something here but people when they looked at it they lived and and and I believe had a great impact on Israel because you know what that serpent on a pole stayed for a long time in Israel and I can imag I can imagine that they would gather at evening you know around a bonfire you know at the tent and gather people and somebody would have a testimony you know a month ago when that serpent thing happened and I was almost dy I was sweating and had fever and and then I could barely look at the servant and I open my eyes and I look and I got to heal and then people are oh my goodness so good and then a year later we do also at Easter you know another big Gathering and we find another brother he got bit by a serpent that was that long and then he gets up and everybody gets quiet brother so and so is going to tell us his testimony how he got healed and and he gets up you know and know you're years later and he's old and he's the last survival who who saw that pole in action think about it and he comes yes people yeah and then as it goes you know the story gets bigger yeah oh yeah it gets bigger and then you get this and you get that and and and it becomes a tradition and everybody is amazed about that thing and and so they keep the serpent on the pole they would never get rid of that CU God used that serpent the pole such mightily it is amazing and suddenly we find another one another Survivor so we organize big meetings to hear this and tell us how he got healed with the serpent on the pole and suddenly the shift there's a shift in what we appreciate there's a shift on what we pay attention there's a shift about what gets us excited and you find yourself years later in second king and there's a king named ezekiah and had remove the high places and break the images and cut down the Groves and break in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses had made for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and he and he called it Newan so it ended up in idolatry that's probably around 500 and 700 something years later how many generations from generation when the last witness died we made a website we print it we wanted to keep this thing so alive but what my question is when was the day when is the Tipping Point where it became idolatry I'm wondering then even 500 years ago ezekiah says okay enough is enough we've shifted our Focus we're missing the point we're taking something that God has used and now we're offering incense to it but I'm wondering it through before that through that 500 years how many men stood up and said we got it wrong this is a Graven image no brother it's not a Graven image this one was sent from God but they got trapped into idolatry they did the same thing with the Ark of the Covenant I'm trying to go quickly I'm almost done for those who are worried come on now same thing with the ark the Ark of the Covenant is a great thing yes it was the most sacred article they had accessories that item was allowed to go behind the veil better than the candle better than the table the Breads and all the accessories this one would see the face of God it was a sign of God's presence in the camp but one day Israel was in a defeat and they were losing against the philistine and they said you know they when the people were coming to the camp the Elders of Israel says where the Lord smitten us today before the Philistine let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us that when it cometh Among Us it may save us right the ark it may save us of the ends of our enemies right that's idolatry exactly you think the ark could save you the ark could not save you God could right but put their faith in something else a god-given accessories but that's what I said before idolatry is not always sports or movie whatever you put between you and God it's whatever you put between you and God the most sacred and holy accessory can be between you and God and becomes idolatry because you put your trust in that instead of putting your trust in God and then we get some hint why it didn't work cuz ofne and Phoenix the Eli's Sons were there they br the ark it gives you an idea that it couldn't be blessed because the word had spoken y those men would fall but what's amazing is that when they brought it they had such a Revival they they scream and shouted it's is it possible to get so excited have so much noise around a fake Revival right get all the emotion he get all the noise so much that the Philistines they're like oh no they have the ark we're in trouble guys and this Philistines says we better be men of Courage because and the Philistine were afraid for they said cuz they were idolators too they knew the deal you know they had their own God they had their own accessories where they trusted and they thought Israel was like them and Israel has become like them y exactly the Philistine were afraid for to say God is come unto the camp and they said woe unto us for there had not been such a thing air for and the Philistine fought and Israel was smitten the ark didn't help at all but even the Philistine were afraid exactly because they were so noisy they got so excited excitement is great I'm all for that I'm excited right now yes right but it doesn't mean that it comes from God right here let's go back to first John 4 what is the discernment right if it's the good spirit or not are you is it Christ in the flesh no they wanted to make Christ in an accessory right right which is idolatry exactly moving on quickly Gideon's how do you call that EOD EOD Gideon Bill and EOD but before that as gidon was getting old when I said that we Crown the dictator we Crown ourselves the niad in spirit Gideon God used them to set them free and as they are free they're asking Gideon now dominate on us rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy son's son also it's not the first time that God use a great Revival true a man and people want to crown him and his sons and his sons of his sons to tell us what to do tell us how to worship tell us how to gather it's in the Bible y right it's idolatry and gidon was awake and he said unto them I will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the Lord shall rule over you Christ will do the ruling but then get in open a little thing here little gap which was enough to bring idolatry anyway gon said unto them I would desire request of you that he would give me every man the hearings of his prey for they had Golden Earrings because they were ishmaelite and their answerer we will willingly give them and then they got gave tons of gold and all kind of stuff and then you know what iil and which kind of a memorial let's celebrate what God did but the Bible says that he put it in the city even in ALA and all Israel went th and Waring after it which thing became a snare onto get into his house it became idolatry so even though when a man says I will not fall into idolatry you think that nicolan Spirit anti Christ is like oh I got defeated I got this knockout punch there's nothing I can do he keeps fighting right find other ways other angle trying to find a gap and something I feel we should be careful is because we believe we're the last age and God sent a prophet that we are spared from that that we don't have to fight that anymore we believe in the message we're all Antichrist Spirit cannot touch us we saw first John 4 the Antichrist Spirit wants to play the manifestation of Christ away from your flesh away from your body and put it on such one holy man can be whoever you want doesn't matter the temple boy did they appreciate the temple they love the temple to such a point that Jeremiah at one point he says thus said the Lord of hosts the god of Israel am men your ways and your doings and I will cause you to dwell in this place trust ye not in lying words saying the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord sometimes there's people like that they keep repeating it makes them feel better the message the message the message okay you know the Bible the Bible the Bible but he says these are lying words because you put your trust into that but your life right is all wrong and that's what he says here he says amend your ways and your doing for he trly amend your ways and your doings if he truly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor if he oppress not the stranger he's talking about the life they live instead of the temple they go but they made the temple they go or the message they believe in with their Pastor they have with their Church they attend to the Pinnacle and we said the Pinnacle is Christ in your life and if Christ is in your life it will make you live a holy life it will bring to manif estation of Christ in your life through you Hallelujah the same thing with the Sabbath oh my the Sabbath they they turned it around and they made man worship the Sabbath yes and even Jesus said you flipped it around right when the means become the goal when God's when God used something and for us instead of the mean it becomes the goal at one point it flipped and the Sabbath became the goal they had to worship the Sabbath and Jesus like come on time out you guys got it wrong the Sabbath was made for men not men for Sabbath but they reversed it God sent a prophet for us amen not us for him right he sent a prophit for us for us to get to Christ simple equation but Antichrist spirit will flip it and make the purpose make make the mean the goal and it becomes the only way of worship let's B our heads I got way more but we will leave it there I think the point God a across yes thank you Lord for while the musician comes play something slowly softly my prayer is that this morning the holy spirit is tearing down Idols amen when that Prophet was in that foreign country and when they accepted Christ Prophet says we could see dust everywhere of the breaking of the idols and as your Prophet said an idol is everything that we put between us and you Lord most of the time we thought about worldly things and we didn't realize that we can put all kinds of thing there is it good to have a pastor it's great I believe we should have one is it good to have a home Church absolutely we should have one is it good to believe a pro absolutely I I totally believe we we had to receive what he had to say yes but Lord we want to be able to discern have we let anything come between you and me and the only way when I I can see that is that when you want to move in my life I'm looking for something to hold on yes Lord I would obey your voice but I need a quote if only your Prophet has said it then Lord I would believe you Lord I I know you put that on my heart L I know but you know if only brother Aaron could give me the green light I would feel and those things are okay God can help us in our in our weak Faith he can help us doing that giving us a quote and giving us the green light from the pastor but he wants us to become more mature so that we can trust his voice and Trust his leadership sh if you believe on Me Greater Works shall you do not just a prophets not just a minister Lord we want we don't want to build nickan Spirit again where only the Ministries are inspired only them fills the burden of the hour maybe some of you this morning need to say Lord I ask you forgiveness I have accepted a prophet I have accepted a pastor in my life I have accepted the Bible I have accepted a church but did I accept the you are you your person welcome in my life not just on Sunday not just when I'm listening to a holy man if there's such a thing but can I welcome you in my life for the sons of God are led by the spirit of God move in our life Lord we ask your forgiveness Lord when you talk to us we look the other way we look for a religious Refuge we look for a tradition to hide we are afraid of your voice and Lord there's one man in the Bible and a woman who were afraid of your voice and it was because of sin wash us Lord of all sins so that we not we would not be afraid of you anymore realize your grace that you love us your your presence is not here to finish us to destroy us it's there to cleans us to to to use us Come Holy Spirit may we welcome you in our life we want to thank you for all the good things you did in our age awesome things [Music] Lord we don't want to use let the devil use it against us as we saw in the scriptures and we there is much more every time you do something Satan turns it against them that's human nature Lord help us give us discernment like first John 4 we recognize the spirit of God in the manifestation of Jesus Christ and the flesh bless this church bless the pastor and officer may we strive for that great purpose that Christ could be manifested in every life that's your great great great purpose we pray in Jesus name amen amen
