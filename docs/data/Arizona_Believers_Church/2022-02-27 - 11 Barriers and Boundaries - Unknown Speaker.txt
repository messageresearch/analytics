TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first corinthians chapter seven and we're going to read verses one to nine and desire today just to relax and share some things that are on our heart continuing on this subject of barriers and boundaries and it is going to still be kind of focused on love has limits but we're kind of changing the emphasis a little bit just to be able to focus more on us another subject first corinthians chapter 7 verses 1 to 9. now concerning the things wherever he wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath no power of his own body but the wife defrauded not one the other except it be with consent for a time that you may give yourselves to fasting in prayer and come together again that satan tempts you not for your incontinency but i speak this by permission and not of commandment for i would that all men were even as myself but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this man and another after that i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn paul kind of puts it in an interesting light there i find if you need to get married so you don't burn go ahead but there's some wonderful things he's expressing here and it's interesting to note that he says let me refer to what you've written me about before he was asked these questions and so there's just some really really profound things that paul is eliciting here for us let's pray together this morning our gracious heavenly father as we're standing together we have just a wonderful feeling in our spirit says the atmosphere i believe the people have created through their expectation and you have come amongst us in a very specific way very precious way to remind us that you are with us and it was expressed to me before service before we prayed a brother shared just how much the lord had impressed upon him that this service was going to be very precise and maybe even very specific for somebody and we realized today lord as a church that maybe maybe it's possible that we have all gathered for the sake of one person and we would not begrudge that at all lord we would be happy to know that we came with our expectation with our readiness with our prayers and with uh with the sincerity and that you could come and move upon one person's heart and make a difference and change their lives we would rejoice in that and lord i would even pray let that be me because we we are we are needy people and we desire that you would speak to us and help us but lord let me just yield myself completely to do my part that you could have your way and may you get the glory for it father commit all thanks to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated the um the new subject that we're going to be looking at and exploring is respect and i think that even this entire subject in many ways can be described as respect you talk about barriers that would be something in your way you're supposed to be doing something but there's a barrier there and if someone put that barrier there that would be disrespectful if you are doing it yourself you're disrespecting some purpose or some cause that god would have you to be accomplishing and so i think it's very easy for us and those of us who have been in this subject now for the first 10 services to to kind of identify just how critical this subject of respect is or just how it's kind of central to the entire thing and then if there are boundaries if you're setting a boundary you are showing that there is a healthy sense of self-respect um and self-protection of your spirit guarding your hearts and protecting your body and then even if we were to observe others boundaries and be sensitive to what they might be going through that's showing a respect for somebody else and brother bram teaches us that if i'm if i respect you and you respect me we're respecting god and so even the way that we respect one another is showing a respect to god into his word so in this subject i will say that um this is based on and resting on the things that we've ministered to this point if someone hasn't heard the first several parts to this i don't think you're going to be confused or at any loss but i have the confidence to explore some of these things knowing that we've established a certain principles in the word of god so if anything does seem to be a little bit out of place you can draw from draw from some of the prior services but in this if i could say this way at the outset on respect it's about respecting yourself and respecting others uh by by observing your thresholds your limits setting limits by observing boundaries and then also by addressing barriers that if there's something in your way and it's hindering you and it's causing a discomfort it's doing something to keep you back and there has to be a healthy way and a scripture way to address a barrier because our spirits need to be free and we do there's a difference in addressing something and confronting something you confront something it's probably going to escalate the barrier is going to get bigger but if you can address it you might find a way through it in a way over it and so those are just some things that i might uh wet your whistle a little bit and get you thinking about what we have in our hearts now i'm going to jump in on a couple scriptures that we've used over the last two services and if we could just now uh if i could just signal that i'm just gonna i'm not reviewing i'm preaching now uh so if the if you need to activate the a man switch um and this is the this is the moment we say all right we're preaching personal story um my dad um likes to play tapes a lot and as a pastor and so he had this habit where he would get up and he'd introduce the tape and so you think well all right he's introducing the tape and then an hour and a half later you're like wait a minute he was preaching i wish i would have known that i would have got i wouldn't have been waiting for the push play and so i'm just letting you know now i'm preaching you know so that you don't you're not you don't have to wait till i'm done with my review i'm ready to go and uh and that was uh that was always a frustrating thing because you're waiting for him you just think it's preface he's just prefacing and next thing you know he's preached for an hour and a half and you're like i missed something i should have been paying attention proverbs chapter 25 verses 27 to 28 it says it is not good to eat much honey for so men to search their own glory is not glory for to seek out your own vindication to lift yourself up to uh think more of yourself than you ought to saying that no matter what glory you think you find he's saying in the end it is not glory but it's detrimental in the same way that eating a lot of honey it might be sweet to taste and you might be finding this to be very very good but you cross this threshold where now it's a detriment to you now it's it's soured your stomach it's made you sick so it's this parallel of honey is good but too much is bad and then he says but to seek your own glory is the same thing if you're going to seek your own glory it's going to end up being a negative it's going to be a detriment and this is this is related to the pride paradox how that you need to have a healthy sense of self you need to value yourself you need to see yourself in the word of god but you can't see yourself the wrong way in a bad sense to where you think less of yourself but you want not to think more of yourself than you should and so with that uh preface he says he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls so this this phrase has no rule over his own spirit means he has no self-control he cannot control himself he has no fence about him he's not within the the prop within the dew bounds or the proper bounds of what he is as a person you can relate this back to somebody who eats too much honey or seeks his own glory this might be somebody who ventures into areas that he ought not to or somebody who thinks more of himself than he should and attempts things and attempts to do things that he shouldn't do or and and he's just simply put has no self-control cannot control himself and uses the phrase is like a city that is broken down this is something that's been breached it's in pieces and it's as a city without walls the city without walls has no borders it has no distinction without walls since there's no borders there's no boundaries there's no clear delineation of responsibility and when does its jurisdiction end at what at what point are we where do our defenses begin where does our responsibility begin and as walls represent protection uh it also in safety it also represents a restraint and a control and this is a beautiful picture for us to consider that if i do not have walls if i do not set boundaries then i'm i have that's a it's a mark of having no self-control whether it is to protect yourself or it whether it is to uh to keep yourself from venturing into things saying and doing things that you shouldn't do and i realize now as i say this that what i was going to preach this morning i'm going to be preaching wednesday night lord willing if i don't preach it wednesday night i'll preach a sunday but i thought this morning would be the end of of this series but the lord just uh kind of you know had his way in the sense of just impressing upon me that there was something else i needed to uh deliver this morning and and reluctantly i'm going to be continuing on wednesday night if unless the lord which he's certainly welcome to do just put it into it or impose again but i realize now in speaking on this that there's uh some other things in terms of recognizing uh limits and even obeying the scripture of things that we shouldn't do to others but also how we ought to respond when others do things to us that really fit together with this and was going to kind of form a foundation for that so i apologize for that detour there but these this scripture is telling us that we ought to control ourselves and that this control is a boundary it's a it's a it's a protection so then first corinthians chapter 10 verse 13. i think this relates to what we were ministering on last sunday there have no temptation taking you but such is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it excuse me this we took this to indicate that we all have limits and that god is recognizing that there is no temptation taking but such as common demand that other men haven't been tempted to uh that they haven't experienced but he's saying that for you individually he will not test you he will not tempt you above what you're able to bear that if you have some limit some threshold that you can't handle this even as a song says i know that i can take it i know that i can make it he's not going to put you through something that you cannot take he's not going to put you through something that you cannot make and he relates the way of being able to handle it that with the temptation there is a way of escape to be able to bear it so even if you say in this if i have to go through this all the way in this condition it'll destroy me it'll be the end of me god is saying no i'm going to give you something that you'll be able to bear up against him not that i'll remove the test or the trial but i'll give you something that you'll be able to bear up against him so god is acknowledging and recognizing that we have limits even though we have faith and we believe in a perfect word the word and this was expressed in great detail last sunday the bible tells us that it knows the word knows what we can handle knows what we're going through knows how we think and how we act and even when god dealt with moses in what seemed to be a very stern way why cried on me speak and this is moses at the red sea that brother brahm said god knew the man he knew what was in his heart he knew how to deal with them and if we looked at it just in the intellectual side we think well god's just a god of tough love and he's just going to kick us when we're down we saw a contrary example and how he dealt with elijah once again he knew elijah he knew his makeup he knew his background he knew his limits he knew what his what his heart was like so god dealt with elijah under the juniper tree different than he did moses at the red sea and we talked about the the thought of the danger zone how man is not cannot live above a certain 8 000 meters it's impossible you can never get used to it you never just say i'm going to bear under it i'm going to get used to it you have to flee that zone you have to get back to proper elevation to live and god has designed our bodies as well as our spirits to recognize when we're reaching a limit he's designed us that way he's designed us in such a way to where if we are coming up against something that is a detriment to our spirits we're coming up against something that is weakening our resolve or or defiling our faith or causing us to doubt or to lust or whatever that there's things that will be signaled in our bodies and our spirits to say hey you're in a situation that you cannot remain in and god has made us that way now there's um and this you'll see here this is where i'm starting to take a step forward in this just as an example has have any of you ever been in a situation where you feel like you can't say no now everybody's on my side now because we've all been there we don't want to say uh uh yes but we feel like we can't say no and what are we experiencing a pressure and and we may feel like well this isn't right or i don't want to do this or i would rather not whatever it might be we start to feel conflicted and we recognize that feeling of being uncomfortable we recognize that feeling of conflict that my conscience tells me to say no but the circumstances tell me that i don't have a choice that i have to say yes i have to give in to it and we all know what that feels like and and i want i want you to consider this that whenever we act against our conscience it wounds our conscience that whenever we're forced to do something that we don't want to do or if we we feel like we can't say no and we do it in in giving in and yielding there's a tax on the mind there's a tax on the body there's a cost uh to our spirits when we're forced to do something like that and the danger is to get in the mode of just always giving in and not recognizing that maybe there's conflict there's and whenever you're feeling that pressure it's for a reason and to give into it is there's a detriment there spiritually there's a detriment to your to your sanctification there's a detriment to your faith and if the more that you kind of get give into it the more numb you get and you forget the reason why you wanted to say no to begin with and there's a kind of a principle that i have maybe used in our my own life or even with my families if they need to know now the answer is no like if you're not gonna be given a chance to pray about it if you're not going to be given an opportunity to weigh uh you know the pros and cons of something if there's pressure i need an answer now i need an answer now then you just remain as you are uh you you don't have to feel that pressure that you have to commit and make a decision if somebody's asking you to say yes to something and they need to know right now then sometimes the best answer is no if you need to know now the answer is no because to to commit and to act against your conscience is going to wound your spirit and some examples of this in proverbs chapter 15 verse 4 it says a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit this the the perverseness therein so it's it's bringing the contrary to a wholesome tongue a wholesome tongue is something that's healthy and something that's encouraging uh something that lifts up a wholesome tongue is a tree of life it's a source of virtue it's a source of strength but perverseness therein perverseness in the tongue and the word that's used in terms of perverseness therein it speaks of words that overwhelm you words that depress you words that make you anxious so there's a way of speaking that is a tree of life that's encouraging invigorating but a perverseness in speech is a breach or a wound in the spirit the proverb is actually just saying hey there's things that you can say that are appropriate and if the appropriate word words fitly spoken are our health and their life and their in their in when they're in the right season in the right context and for the right reason man it's just life in your bones it's invigorating it gives you energy it gives you strength it gives you courage it's appropriate you're saying appropriate things versus inappropriate things something that's inappropriate encourages you something inappropriate discourages you and uses the phrase a breach in the spirit so there's things that are healthy the right kind of speech is healthy but then the wrong kind of speech is harming so we cannot subject ourselves to things that are unhealthy and think that there's not a breach or a wound to some extent in proverbs chapter 12 verse 18 there is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword amen to that right you've heard words you've heard sayings you've heard comments before that are just kind of maybe at best caddy but really at the end of the day kind of really pointed you're trying to be very very sharp trying to hurt they're kind of aimed at a way to pierce you to wound your spirit so there's a way that can be uh the way that we can speak that is the piercing the thrust the stab it's a wounding of a sword but the tongue of the wise is health what is the bible doing the bible is telling us and making us wise to breaches or trespasses and offenses this is this is not behavioral science this is not psychology this is the bible saying that this is human nature this is the way that your body and spirit are made and this is the way that humans act and that we can all relate to this that there's a way that we can talk that encourages somebody there's talk that we can listen to that discourages us and there's words and sayings and mannerisms and way people can behave that pierces us it wounds our spirit we can walk away feeling like that didn't feel good and that wasn't said right and i i'm sure we can all recall situations where somebody kind of just makes a comment and then it's kind of a delayed reaction you're kind of walking away and you're like wait a minute that hurt that wasn't that wasn't very nice and it was maybe even meant that way it was intended that way and the bible is saying hey there there are trespasses against our spirits there are wounds a breach in our spirit that we have to we we need to be conscious of and why would it tell us this why would the bible tell us that there's a perverseness in in the tongue that's a breach in the spirit why would it tell us that there's a way of speaking that that pierces like a sword so that we could avoid speaking that way and we could avoid being spoken to that way the bible says in matthew chapter 7 verse 12 therefore all things whatsoever you would do that men that ye would do that men should do to you do ye even so to them do unto others as you would have them do unto you i need to treat somebody else the way that i would want that person to treat me for this is the law and the prophets as somebody shared with me i think we were talking about the platinum rule but maybe the uh uh the fool's gold rule would be do unto others before they do unto you i think that's what somebody mentioned i've heard that one before i've experienced that one before but he says this is the law and the prophets this sums it all up that even the way that he says it here do unto others as you would have them do unto you or love thy neighbor as thyself as we'll come to here in a little bit is actually embodying the cons of the truth and the command to love the lord thy god with all you are your heart soul and mind that to love god with everything is going to be manifest and expressed in loving thy neighbor as thyself or doing to others as you would have them to do unto you and so we will treat others in a manner that we believe that we ought to be treated and this can signal either a positive attitude or a negative attitude because we can allow ourselves to be hurt because we don't view ourselves in a healthy way we can allow ourselves to be spoken to in a way that is very sharp we can allow ourselves to experience many different breaches in our spirit because on some level we may not view ourselves as as worthy of protecting and that well i just have to be able to put up with it and i don't feel like i can say no whatever that pressure might be but then there's also a sense in which we may endure hurts because we abuse others and we think that kind of conduct is appropriate or justified i know there's a lot of different ways we could think about this but if the bible's saying to do unto others as you would have them to do unto you you have to be you have to have a healthy view of how you want people to treat you and and if you mistreat other people you might find a way of always justifying that so that you would justify if they treated you the same way well they're doing they're i do do it to them they do it to me this is just the way that we are maybe you just blame it on your last name well that's just we're family this is just the way we are there might be a way that you conduct yourself because you think this is the way you ought to be this is the way you would treat somebody else so they have every right to treat you that way or in another sense you may just feel that you deserve it and i would never do that to somebody else but maybe i deserve it and that's not having a very healthy view of yourself i've noticed this maybe in my own life that um there's a that can have maybe a just a uh whether you say maybe a private nature or selfish nature it may be more appropriate to say that and because i may be reluctant um is this therapy no because um because i may be reluctant to to share i find that i'm also reluctant to have somebody share with me this is what it used to be years ago that and thank god god gave me a very unselfish wife but there's uh you find if you wouldn't let somebody borrow something from you guess what you're probably you know in a healthy way wouldn't ask to borrow from somebody else right now where the narcissist comes in is they would never let you borrow anything from them but they'll ask you for everything but uh there's there's this and i'm just wanting to relate to how sometimes the way we think hinders us because we think well i would never let somebody else have and i would never share i would never ask so then where or i would never give so then you never ask and it's limiting it's holding you back i know there's that was maybe a mouthful i appreciate you let me share it but i want you to be thinking about this in the scripture way that the bible's showing this to us now in second corinthians chapter 9 verses 6 to 7 verses 6 6 and 7 this might seem to be a little bit of a leap but bear in mind what we're talking about how there's this a way of speaking that is a confrontational and it's a breach it's a wound and and feeling this pressure this conflict paul says but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully this is a principle of you reap what you sow and if you're going to sow a little you're going to get back a little if you sow a lot you're going to get back a lot so there is a direct connection of what you get in life to what you're giving there's a connection to what you're which are what you're harvesting to what you're sowing so our conduct and the way that we approach life and the way that we approach other people and what we get out of people is sometimes what we're sowing into them and i say this now because i realize that i'm going to i'm i'm going to be getting into this area and i may not mention it but in a lot of ways we could view ourselves that all of us uh we're going we saw and what we saw we get back and god designed god designed relationships in the beginning that whatever whatever was sown into the woman she was going to produce and it's a characteristic still exists today that if you if you sow frustration you're so hurt you sow certain things into your wife guess what you're going to get right back out because she's designed that way it's so it's the way that god has made even our spirits as a bed and ground and paul is is touching on you have control you have a large control over what you sow therefore you have you have control over what you're receiving and then he says every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give now now this is you if you want to give sparingly you're going to reap sparingly if you give bountifully you're going to reap bountifully but then so what he says is not so then you have to sow bountifully he says but let every man as he deems reasonable within himself in this autonomy within himself as he purposes in his heart let him give give according to what is in your heart and then he says not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver it's not just giving but how cheerful you are when you give remember how the scripture says that love is not indecent does not behave itself unseemingly and so there's a d the love will always behave itself decently it'll always behave in an appropriate way it will never be inappropriate it'll never be excessive it'll always just be just exactly right and it's saying that love in not behaving unseemly is not disrespectful it's i mean when you look at the word and what the greek is trying to express to us in the context of how paul said he says love is not disrespectful and and this is so then this is speaking to the appropriateness of how one ought to uh and i the scripture that comes to mind is that the love of god is expressed in that we would keep his commandments if you love me keep my commandments and in the keeping of the commandments it's not grievous and that would demonstrate a real love i i want to why would you do that i want to do it because i love them i want to do this because i love to do this it's not a detriment it's not a mark it's not a curse to somebody and so it's something that is appropriate not forceful and when paul says let every man give as is in his heart not grudgingly or of necessity don't give through a heaviness don't get don't give through a pain though there may be some sacrifice and you may be not giving from abundance but giving from what you have is a little and it may be something that is felt you shouldn't be giving through this grudgerly and it's a pain and this is a heaviness to where i i'm going to do it but it's a there's a price in your spirit does that make sense that you can you do it but if you give it if you give it begrudgingly and we we've been in that situation before where we ask for something and it's kind of like well fine you could have it we're like never mind i don't think i want it under those under that pretense because it's not going to be healthy going forward so he's he's identifying that those kind of emotions don't give through a heaviness or a pain and then he says or of necessity and even grudgingly sp speaks this don't give because it's imposed or forced on you because of necessity it means to be taken advantage of don't give through coercion or influence don't give because you've been made to feel obligated well i guess i'll give bountifully because paul said if i don't give bountifully i'm gonna i'm not gonna reap bountifully no you're missing it paul says if you give a little you'll you'll reap a little if you give a lot you'll reap a lot he's just telling you the principle you choose how you want to reap you choose how you want to sew it's completely within your control and it's like well but if you put it that way i feel like i have no choice no you absolutely do have a choice you give as you were able to in your heart and don't do it grudgingly don't give it of necessity this of necessity means don't give it because you're being taken advantage of and you're being coerced and you're being forced now if you want to say well this has to do with uh giving to the church this has to do with any service this has to do with any kind of offering any kind of giving anything that you would if you want to say this relates to any expression of the of love language this gives this it has to do with any sacrifice or any offering any time being spent anyway it even relates to how that we would serve god he has not wanted us to serve god because we've been manipulated or coerced or made to feel obligated don't give through this pain now this is a breach this is hurting me i don't want to do it i feel like i can't say no don't do because it's forced or you're being coerced the word the languages being of course are made to feel obligated peter refers to this kind of feeling in first peter chapter five verse two he's speaking to a shepherd feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof and that's quite a task to to feed the flock of god which is among you and take oversight thereof you can take responsibility watch out for their souls but then he says not by constraint but willingly not for filthy luker but of a ready mind but that phrase not by constraint but of a ready mind but willingly of a ready mind not by constrainer by filthy luker it's almost like it takes these these these opposites and says you shouldn't have to do it by constraint or for money but you should be doing it willingly and of a ready mind and he's attacked these uh mechanisms within the mind of men that can be very very detrimental and very corrosive uh to leadership into the way that uh the way that they feel about their calling and how that they're serving because he's saying that a pastor should not be pastoring because he feels obligated to do it by constraint and the sense that well god is binding me here and if he could if he told me right now it's my choice i could leave i'd be out of here and the doors would just be as i you just beat i'm i'm out of here i'm gone i'm not gonna have a thought about you that's he said that's the wrong that's the wrong place to be as a pastor that you feel like you're there because god called you to it you're forced to do it and so he's touched on this i feel obligated to do it i i have to do this it's it's by constraint and instead of there being a willingness that god's called me to this and i'm willing to do this i'm happy to do this and if he was to all of a sudden tell me i can't do this there'd be some sense of loss there'd be some sense of a passion and zeal and enthusiasm that i have for this calling that there'd be an emptiness and so he's dealing with force we ought not to give out of force we ought to be to give in the sense that i feel like i'm being taken advantage of i'm being manipulated into this and peter's talking about hey you shouldn't pastor out of being forced to do it but you should have a willingness and a ready mind because the truth is we never i i don't care who you are be honest real talk we never want to be forced to do something we don't want to do we never want to be forced to do something that's against our will we don't want to be forced to do something that's against our that we're not comfortable with now you might play briar rabbit oh please don't throw me in the briar patch please please please but that's home you like that there there's so it's an honesty how we do we don't like to be forced to do something we're not comfortable with we don't like to be asked to do something that that i'm feeling i i feel like the forces that are acting to cause me to do this are more manipulating uh uh the good it's manipulating my sincerity it's manipulating my willingness it's manipulating even my gifts or my abilities as opposed to really motivating me to do it because there's a way that you can there's a way that you can be inspired to do something that's very healthy and someone asks you to do something and maybe you don't initially want to do it but there's a way that you can be approached where something turns in your heart like you know what initially i didn't want to but now i kind of see that this is what the lord wants me to do i kind of see that this will be healthy this will be good for my family or this is a wonderful opportunity and and things turn and it's not because you've been manipulated or somebody has used psychology on you but the right approach has motivated you to exercise a gift to give and to free yourself and to be used for a particular purpose and that's healthy because in the end there's a reward for that but if you find yourself in conflict and you're feeling that there's some sort of coercion and there's force that's manipulation and you get your arm twisted and you do it you're not going to feel good in the end even if the job's done and it's done well in the end it's not going to leave a good taste in your mouth so what is the bible recognizing force the use of force to accomplish something which i guess i i could say just to make my title more relevant that's disrespectful that's not showing respect there's even a way that we can sometimes try to force our children to do things that's not respecting them as a person i i found one time i was i had this sense of being very uncomfortable seeing kids being forced to hug people they didn't know i started thinking that's kind of weird i mean like what if you ask me right now brother aaron go go hug that person like really it's kind of this awkward dance i don't know if this happens for sisters but sometimes you realize brothers are kind of sizing each other up do i go in for the hug what do i do because you don't want to offend somebody right like come over here brother bring it in and they're kind of like whoa you know hold on covet 19. and so there's always this really odd thing where you're shaking one person you're reading their body language i don't think they want to hug and then the next guy can like i want to you know and you're hugging this guy and you didn't hug that guy and you kind of feel awkward like well come here and it's like no brother you read it right the first time and so there's a you know what i was talking about bring them in oh wait want to take the name of jesus with you where are we it's a it's the idea of of being forced to do something and how that that we have to be very conscious of what is respectful and there's a way that we feel that we have authority over our children therefore we can ask them to do things by our authority but we could be disrespecting their autonomy we could be disrespecting their sense of personal we could be disrespecting what they're comfortable with and sometimes we want to try to force something and and we immediately can begin to recognize when it's pride like you feel shamed or embarrassed and so you want to force something we have to be very sensitive because it is an issue of respect and that is something that i've mentioned before and this is what i want to uh emphasize in this statement that i'm going to take from the church age book is that love has to be love which is the word of god has to be what's motivating us this zealousness to fulfill god's purpose this desire to to lift up the word of god to be very uh zealous to defend his character that's love that's the that's the what's embodied in in agape love is it's it's connected with the word of god so when we act even if it's to teach even if it's true discipline even if it is to inform or correct we are not correcting from and we're not teaching from the position that we're right or we have the authority but that there's something in the word there's some benefit in the word of god that we're we're lifting up there's some principle in the word of god that we're being advocates for on behalf of the other person not merely just doing it because this is right and since it's right uh uh then it would it i can use might and i can use force and i can use manipulation because at the end of the day it's the word of god that i'm i'm i'm serving that's that's wrong and brother branham this is uh this is real dense language to read very heavy language to read but notice just this thought that unfolds in the church age book chapter five once the nice council had swung the power of political rome to the church it seemed that there that there were no limits to which this first christian church would go the name christian now this is the this is the the change because now the first christian church is a combination of political power and church power ecclesiastical power so it's not like the first church on the day of pentecost this is the the evolution of the antichrist the name christian which originally brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors when you come across a lot of regions or cultures that despise christianity it's because they've experienced it from a different perspective and this is very interesting when you study it historically to the pagans and to the heathens it didn't bother them at all that you worship jesus christ why because they worship deities didn't bother them that you worshiped god the one true god because they worshiped all different kinds of god where the conflict began is not in the fact that christians worshiped other another god but that the christians were intolerant of the pagans and it was the christian's intolerance and the persecution of the pagan that caused the response from the non-believers did you realize that historically because there's this is what this is kind of the evolution and then the christian church became the persecutor it was in the age that augustine of hippo set forth the precept that the church ought and must think about this ought and must use force if necessary to bring her children back into the fold and that it was in harmony with the word of god to kill the heretics and apostates this is a this is an incredible shift in christianity and and i'd say these shadows still there's still these shadows within christianity today that though we may not burn somebody at the stake but there's these instincts that exist within christianity today that we can use force if necessary whether it be political pressure social pressure ostracization shaming that all these things are at our disposal to use force if necessary to bring children back into the fold or keep them in the fold and to justify it by saying this is in harmony with the word of god to kill to assassinate someone's character who we deem to be a heretic or apostate in his controversy with the donatist he wrote this is now and i believe i've italicized it so we would recognize this as somebody else's writing it is indeed better that men should be led to worship god by teaching than that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain amen yes i love that approach teaching being the motivating factor and driving someone to worship god than to be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain but and this is a that's a very very uh anonymous but but it does not fall that because the former course produces the better men therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected see what he's saying teaching's the best way and teaching produces better men but if there are those who cannot be taught it does not mean that they should be neglected we should resort to other means to get those who cannot be taught to toe the line if you're not going to do it by what's being said and what's being taught what's being preached we'll find other ways to do it and they're called deacons you laugh but i know churches where deacons would take young men out into the shed and beat them in the message they may not use fist anymore but they'll use their words for many have found advantage as we have proved in our daily proving by actual experience in being first compelled by fear or pain we have found advantage we have found and we are experiencing this on a daily basis just how fruitful our use of fear and pain are in turning the reprobate and even into real christians so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching so that they might follow out and act what they have already learned in word whilst those are better who are guided or right by love those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear i i think they wrote it without any sense of irony at all without any sense of they're going to think this is the babylon bee when they they unearth this i mean this is not satire he's as serious as can be that yes teaching would be the best motivator and a lot teaching produces the better men and love those who are guided by love they are the better but certainly there's more in number who are corrected by fear but then he says for who can possibly love us more than christ who laid down his life for the sheep and this is a trap right because then you're thinking yes christ he he was self-sacrificial and he was willing to yield himself and he humbled himself and so he says you had to after calling peter and the other apostles by his words alone when he came to summon paul he not only constrained him with his voice but even dashed him to the earth with his power that he might forcibly bring one who is raging amidst the darkness of infidelity to desire the light of the heart he first struck him with the physical blindness of the eyes why therefore should not the church use force in compelling her lost sons to return this is how immediately it changed from the love of christ no greater love hath the man that he laid down his life for his friends and here's the love of christ expressed in being the sacrifice and being the lamb and he says but remember after he used words to compel his disciples to follow and they summoned them then when it came to dealing with paul he dashed him to the earth he smote him blind he was he struck him with physical blindness he used force to bring uh to strike against the raging darkness to that his heart would desire light and he says so then why should not the church use force in compelling her lost sons to return and again with no sense of recognizing that christ as the sacrifice could do that christ as having first been the lamb has the authority to be the lion and that without any sense of being self-sacrificial without any sense of being perfect in the knowledge and the character of christ we're just going to try to fit this mode of bashing people and dashing them and making them feel the pain and be scared in the darkness to then seek the light he said the lord himself said go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in wherefore if the power which the church has received by divine appointment in its due season through the religious character and faith of kings be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges that is in heresies and schisms are compelled to come in then let them not find fault with being compelled and in other words let them not find fault with force being used to convert somebody the inquisition and even the spread of christianity under the guy under the power of the catholic church even in where we're living right now in this state you had those explorers who found themselves found indian tribes who did not know of jesus christ did not know and one true god who there's an ultimatum given you must worship jesus christ you must accept the one true god or will commit genocide in the name of christianity and this is how they approached it this and they justified it feeling that we have every right to use force to accomplish something now that's the extreme think about all the other subtle ways this this uh this kind of dynamic can exist within our hearts this is the worst instinct of leadership this is really the worst characteristic of a church is to control by fear because it's the opposite of faith but the worst thing you could do is to compel by force paul and even trying to lift up how important it would be to exhibit a certain characteristic says but still nonetheless it has to be in your heart to do it because in the end you can't do it grudgingly you can't do it of necessity otherwise it's not going to resonate with god and produce the benefit that you would like to for others or even for yourself if somebody does something for you and maybe i often joke when someone says brother aaron thank you so much for doing this it really means a lot to us and i always i kind of joke and say well i felt like i had to and and i do it jokingly i hope nobody's ever taken me serious with that before because you know that in saying that it kind of ruins the whole thing or they felt like they had to well i felt like you expected it i felt like you needed it or you wouldn't be my friend immediately it's kind of like well wait a minute that means nothing anymore and so that's the the beneficiary of it is robbed and you're robbed too because how you're going to have the wrong kind of pride that says well did you hear what i did the other day and there's going to be this sense of seeking your own glory that kind of honey is going to make your stomach sick and so it's the worst it's the these are kind of the worst dynamics that can work upon a person to do something and and i want to identify this it's very subtle now how this force works very subtle how these and these um attributes of abuse can continue to work within the frameworks of organizations or or families or relationships or churches they may not be calling you out as a heretic or apostate or reprobate and threatening to burn you at the stake but there can be this very overt pressure that works in the same way to not teach out of love but to compel by force and fear and galatians chapter 5 verses 13 to 15. i i sense a a real uh appetite for the word of god today just by the look upon your face your faces are indicating you're listening and i appreciate that very much in galatians chapter 5 verses 13 14 and 15 and i recognize the matter is unique and even the manner is unique so i appreciate your diligence this morning in galatians chapter 5 verses 13 14 and 15 for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only used not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another i wonder what augustine the hippo would say about that i wonder where this scripture fit into his paradigm that you have been called unto liberty so we have this liberty we have this freedom but don't use your liberty as for an occasion to the flesh now the the correct instinct is to think about lasciviousness or this license where i'm free in christ therefore i can do anything i want but it it's more than that it speaks to a i say it's more than that it's not better than that but that includes behavior that we justify because we're free or because we have we sense this liberty to do it he says but then moderate your liberty moderate your freedom by this tenet through love serve one another that man i am free to do whatever i want i am absolutely free but what becomes the the boundary to that action what becomes the boundary that activity is how my conduct or my behavior affects somebody else she says my love serve one another for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this all the law upon this hangs all the law and the prophets for this is the law of the prophets do unto others as you would have them to do unto you this is all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments love the lord thy god with everything you are and love thy neighbor as yourself because in this hangs all the law and the prophets and these two commandments are just like one another paul says it this way for all the laws fulfilled in one word one commandment this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself paul takes the words of christ and just even condenses it down further saying this sums it all up and immediately he says but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another the galatian church as you read about their certain their circumstances and the things that paul's having to address you can see that they're in a constant state of distraction just this there's continual strife and contention there's always this some combating and fighting a drama as maybe we might use today there's a lot of drama in the galatian church and and paul's having to address it and he says that our liberty and i want i want to come back to this uh we've been called to liberty and we are free but in our freedom to almost live unencumbered we have to have this uh sensitivity to other people because we shouldn't use this liberty to serve ourselves to make ourselves feel good or merely lift ourselves up but we now being free we can kind of turn this freedom that christ has given us internalize it then express it out towards other people wanting them to experience the same internal liberty and freedom and deliverance we've experienced so it doesn't it does not translate to a selfishness i want to serve other people now he says because if you don't fulfill the word of god by loving your neighbor as you love yourself it's expressed in this biting and devouring and being consumed one another but you bite it means evil speaking you bite with these words these sharp words you bite one another and you devour it speaks of railing or clamor it's a it's a it's a stripe to rail it's to insult loudly clamor it's it it's it's it's this way of speaking to where the words are overwhelming the words are condescending it's biting you buy it you devour it's competitiveness what was it the over topping that we read in the scripture that there's this idea that if somebody says well i i walked a mile yesterday i said man that's great you don't walk at all that's awesome you walked a mile i'm proud of you kind of like oh well i ran eight miles backwards you know up the verado steps and down and it's kind of like oh yeah and the mile i got was you know at the zoo with my kids too so i feel really sheepish now it's just over top you bite you devour he says take heed did you not consume to one another it means you're consumed to the bitterness you're consumed by the strife all the contention all the fighting all the competitiveness all the force all the coercion just overwhelms you and i'm gonna leave this off for the um maybe for the next part of god would lead me to do it that there's a way that we begin to exist within that kind of dynamic to where you're either consumed by it and you assimilate and become part of it or it destroys you you realize i either have to be i either have to step up my devouring game and i've got to really get good at biting or i'm going to be chewed up you either assimilate or you're destroyed by it you become subject to it and that's exactly what paul is saying because he's alluding to the the the idea of beast of prey falling upon one another and dividing one another ignor normally maybe a a beast of prey would find i would go after the sheep and devour the sheep but now it's kind of this illusion of a beast of prey falling upon another beast of prey and them devouring one another but even more odd as paul is saying that not only that though a beast would prey upon a sheep to devour them and maybe a prey could prey on another predator he's saying now the sheep are devouring each other and that makes no sense so verse 13 as i come back to it it just struck me how that paul is identifying this principle that we should never let our liberty lead to somebody else's bondage we should never let our liberty be expressed and our faith be expressed and our christianity be justified that there's i can act boldly but yet it's arrogantly i can act uh with authority but it's presumptuously there's a way that we begin to act where we're not really spreading the gospel we're not really putting footsteps to uh to uh the promised land we're acting disrespectfully we're acting belligerently we're acting a way to where it's an occasion for our flesh and not truly loving our loving our neighbor as ourselves never let your liberty become somebody else's bondage i ask the question just because we can should we just because we can should we in other words because i have the power and the ability to do it should i do it just because i can should i do it because i have the opportunity to do it should i take advantage of the opportunity just because i have the privilege i have the power i have the privilege i have the opportunity everything's at my disposal having the power having the privilege and now having the opportunity am i therefore justified in acting and i would reason no power privilege and opportunity are never the reasons why we would act we act because it's the right thing we act because it's appropriate in the jubilee year brother and i i'm using this as an example of this not just doing it because you can he says my friend you don't know how i love you you don't realize that when i'm he says and he pauses so there's a fragment here and he says that i don't try to scold you just because i stand in the pulpit i'd be taking advantage of you here's here's just a quick phrase that he uses to show that you don't realize that when i'm standing this pulpit and now this is the words of brother aaron now i say things that are hard and maybe i say things that are cutting and it might seem like i'm scolding you but i'm not just stan i'm not just saying it because i ca i can i'm not just saying it because i'm the pastor i'm not just saying it because it's right and it's truth and i'm not just saying it because you know the you come to the church this is the house of god and this is a house of correction this is a house judgment begins in the house of god everybody get ready to be slayed he said i don't do this because if i was doing it just for those reasons i'd be taking advantage of you you're a captive audience you're a sincere audience you're an audience that believes and this working of of men of god standing behind the pulpit and preaching the word of god you are in a willingness and through voluntary you're voluntarily this morning coming to sit in church to hear what i have to say there there is a vulnerability that exists you are coming as sheep to listen to another sheep today i'm a son of god just as you are a daughter of god or a son of god i have i have no greater position in in the grace and mercy of christ than any of you but then need god wanting to speak to you places a gift in someone's life and a calling in someone's life and that doesn't give them power over you to take advantage of you it creates this it creates this i want to say uneasiness but there has to be this recognition of vulnerability that you sit here today and i could take advantage of that and say things that can harm your spirit or mislead your zeal and enthusiasm and brother i'm saying man if i just stood up here and scolded you because i stand in the pulpit i'd be taking advantage of you it's this warning to don't take advantage of somebody he says in the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel this is just another example so i'm using this as evidence and maybe it doesn't fit within the continuity of the thought but it's just used as a supplemental evidence the woman is a weaker vessel i know there can't be a bad man before there's a bad woman it's a heavy saying but men who knows that men who knows that you are son of god and take advantage of a woman's shame on you you know that a woman could a woman is the weaker vessel and you claim to be a son of god and you take advantage of the woman's weakness he says shame on you no matter what she does she's a weaker vessel and you know that and if she goes to act an unladylike take her by the hand and talk to her like a sister you're a son of god don't do them evil things now however it is you'd want to take the however the picture is painted to your heart to what brother branham is alluding to we we can all agree on this principle that he's saying that the woman is the weaker vessel and can be taken advantage of and as a christian man you should never take advantage of your power use your power to an advantage over a weaker vessel and this principle is is so striking to catch our attention your son of god you should never use your power never use your authority in a situation where somebody is vulnerable or weaker says that's wrong to do that and and it may be obvious in the way that he what he's alluding to that because you have the power you could take advantage of somebody who's not ladylike or somebody who may allow certain things to happen and there's this rebuke and he's scolding these men for doing these evil things but he takes the time to identify this imbalance of power that you you or knowingly taking advantage of somebody's vulnerability and how foul that is and how evil that is because it's in in the way that we might just recognize this an uh unholy woman and somebody taking advantage of an opportunity we might be able to just kind of look at that in the sense of oh well the the error is in what resulted but the air was in the approach to begin with there's an air in that let's not let's not look at the one side go oh well that's where that's where that's with a sin no the sin manifested in that you can back up and find where it began and the genesis was a lack of respect the genesis was not to appreciate the vulnerability of somebody the the the the genesis though it would it might manifest in conduct that's obviously lewd in what's been alluded to here it can manifest its place itself in ways that are much more subtle but be the same dynamic of a lack of respect for somebody else's boundaries a lack of respect for somebody else's sensitivities a lack of respect for somebody else's weakness and instead of lifting them up and encouraging them and treating them like a sister you treat them as a second class citizen it's very interesting where society is coming today with the uh i wanted to say advancements but i feel like we're crawling backwards uh in in terms of now through uh freedom liberties and and scientific achievement men can be women and i saw a headline the other day and i think this was spurred on by the controversy of a swimmer in college who had transitioned from being a male he's a male swimmer and he transitioned to and i know this is just weird i can't even believe we're talking about it but uh he identifies as a woman and i don't know the exact uh transition he's gone through but now he competes competitively as a woman in collegiate athletics and is winning as a male swimmer in a pool uh a pool of swimmers female swimmers and the the headline was women are now third class citizens i was like you better believe it that's exactly the fallout for the sense of liberty and freedoms and people should have a right to be whoever you are they don't think about the consequence you think maybe god knew what he was doing when he created a man as a man and a woman as a woman you don't think he understood balances and and harmony and unity and oneness and then also you introduce another uh mansur into the equation and now all of a sudden everything's different because now you have one that kind of occupies this unique space between the man and the woman and do you think he's going to be the third class shem's not going to be the third class he's going to exist between the man and a woman and now the woman is the third class citizen and again it's a it's a boundary violation it's stepping outside the order that god's created and what it becomes chaotic everything gets turned upside down now in ephesians chapter 5 verse 33 and and i'm going to read quickly uh allude to this because i want you to recognize that this this dynamic of this disrespect and using liberty for the occasion of the flesh it's not just always going to be exhibited maybe in this area that is a lewdness in an inappropriate relationship paul says nevertheless let every one of you in particular and so instead of speaking to the generality of christ to the body and the body to christ and the general relationship he says let each one of you he's like coming back to his original thought because as he embellished on the dynamics of christ in the church let each one of you in particular so loved his wife even as himself does that sound if familiar can do do unto others as you'd have them to do unto you thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself this is a sincere prevailing affection this is you would love your wife like you would for yourself this affection you'd have for yourself that that this respect you would desire this um what kind of affirmation and confidence you would want to be instilled in you and saying that you ought to love your wife love your wife even as yourself and even more so in this context because the two are one no man has ever hated his own flesh so this is moderating the change in the attitude you would have towards your wife how can you use this scripture to to demean your wife and devalue her as being somebody who's a doormat he says make you should love your wife even as yourself and see that the and the wife see that she reverenced her husband this word reverence it's translated irreverence but it's really respect which reverend speaks of that it's it's it's not not a fear and i'm afraid he'll hit me or he's stronger than me it's this reverence it's the respect for the husband and unity is a central principle in marriage there has to be unity there has to be harmony there has to be agreement there has to be mutual respect there has to be voluntary accountability there has to be a mutual dependency between the husband and the wife you say oh well he he pays the bills and he has the job and he knows how to do this he's the head and he's this but that head is dependent upon the wife just as the wife is depend upon the husband it may be different respects and different callings in different ways but if it ever becomes a codependency things get crazy abuse control manipulation dissatisfaction contempt uh all sorts of bitterness begins to breed in that kind of environment so paul is expressing that in a relationship there has to be a a unity and there must be a mutual respect it's not saying husbands love your wives in other words you just love them and you think they're beautiful and you really married up and and you and you just want to kiss them and the wife you better respect your husband it's speaking the same thing listen to this statement and in psalms 25 14 i have a uh something that's lodged in my mind when i saw just how long i preached wednesday night and it horrified me so i was like i need to make up for it sunday morning by preaching like 45 minutes too late we'll just cancel the evening service fair enough psalms 25 14 the seeker of the lord is with them that fear him now that fear is not i'm afraid of god it's respect it's the reverence it's in awe of how great he is it's all of how perfect his word is and it says the secret of the lord is with them that fear him so in respect through respect comes a secret so respect comes some comes something that's very intimate and he will show them his covenant this is a secret counsel this is a familiar converse this is intimacy so he's saying the secret there's a secret there's something unknown there's something that's shared with you in the respect where there's this mutual respect where there's this respect of god it invites this secret because he will show you his covenant there will be the secret council disclosure of intimate knowledge and i want to use that as a principle in a marriage where there is mutual respect where there's mutual respect and reverence where there's a husband that loves his wife and a wife that loves her husband when there's a husband who has submitted himself to his wife as the scripture says that we ought to and how that the wife has submitted to herself to her husband when there is love and respect mutually in a marriage there's intimacy true intimacy there's knowledge it's not what brother branham refers to earlier as just some sort of evil thing uh some unrighteous unholy act where there's mutual respect that's where there's true affection that's where there's true intimacy brother brahm says in a thinking man's filter just to identify that this theme that's that's uh being lifted up in this relationship context is respect he says all for the grace of god that he would give us understanding of such great mysteries you're never going to have it without respecting god as paul spoke here further on down in ephesians speaking of the husband and the wife and said this is a mystery how the woman should be in respect to their husband even the second place i believe the entire bible that reverence was ever spoke said the woman seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband so it's respect that's being spoken of then a husband all right you ready all right husbands have been amen in quite a bit wives you can exercise discretion then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of god you recognize that the respect is not coerced the respect is not forced the respect is not manipulated the respect is not you don't have to give it grudgingly you don't have to give it by constraint you have to you don't have to do it of necessity like well there's not going to be any peace in this home unless i pretend to reverence him he's really drilling down the real the real grain of truth how it ought to be saying then a husband when paul says that a woman should reverence her husband it's not in a vacuum it arises from the fact that he's teaching husbands how they ought to act and how they ought to treat their wife and he's saying that if a husband can do his part it makes it really easy for the wife to do hers and i said that you might as well just start there that no men should put their hands in their pockets or fold their arms and so if my wife just did her part it would make it easier for me to do mine no it starts with you you be the one that loves and she'll be the one that respects he says a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could respect him he says reverence him as the son of god and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him and all those sisters said oh no i i was just going to say just that side eye to you the sister across the aisle before our neighbor in the apartment next door doesn't live that kind of life of course she wouldn't reference him here's the wake up call to to the men in the relationship well i can't always demand respect because of course if i'm not living the kind of life she could respect i'm never going to get it because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is a reverent man reverend and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of god then the woman children and all should respect that servant of god with reverence that's beautiful now can we close with the text first corinthians chapter seven verses one to nine paul is clearly uh he's talking about respect within a relationship now i i sense that maybe i just need to kind of back up it's clear we're talking about respect but if you don't have respect then you'll use you'll use liberty you'll take your liberty and take advantage of somebody else and i'm you i'm looking in the context of a marriage but i want us to think bigger than this because there's some of us here who are not married and all the single brothers said amen but yet there's still instruction in this there's still ways that we could recognize that this informs me as a single man this informs me as a grandparent this informs me in whatever area of life i'm in that i need to recognize that there's a way there's a way a conduct is right and becoming of a christian and i cannot violate it certainly not using christianity as a justification for it and that there's a there's a way that there's there's a way that love acts what love is and what it isn't what it does and what it doesn't there's a way that it acts as a way that it's uh manifested and it cannot be manifested in force that we're wanting to peel away certain layers and there's things i recognize in my own heart that are that are responses to wounds and complexes and i behave that way not because i'm sincere but because i'm afraid there's ways that i act in a defensive way not maybe because i'm mean-spirited but because i'm afraid and i realize there's things that need to be healed in my heart things that i want to overcome ways that i want to see people better or better understand why they are the way they are so i'm not always existing in this realm of being defensive or being forceful that i can completely relax in his love for me and be confident in what he made me and not always be defensive or put myself forward resort to pretense or feel that i've got to carve out some kind of niche to feel special and so this is an example that's very pertinent to us as to those of us who are married but may please make it applicable in much a much broader sense in first corinthians chapter 7 verses 1 to 9 i think i won't read all of it though but he says that they wrote unto him and so it's good he says concerning the things you wrote to me and he just gets right on the subject it's good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have their own husband let the husband render unto the wife do benevolence that's due love do tenderness do care do provision do protection that's what is all assumed in benevolence it's what do her and what does love do it gives what is due it never dethron defrauds it never re holds back something that someone is due it renders in a wife rendering to the wife dude benevolence and likewise also the wife under the husband so she also renders due love and tenderness and care provision protection there's a it's mutual the wife hath no power of her own body but the husband bless god musicians if you'd come we hit it there we finally got to it and likewise us also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife do you realize how often husbands have used the mantra i'm the husband i'm the head you're my wife to do whatever they want but it doesn't work the other way even though the bible is saying the man the woman has no power over her own body but the husband but in the same way the husband has no power over his own body but the wife it's mutual so he says defraud you not one another accept it be with consent for a time that you may give yourselves to fast in prayer and come together again that satan tempts you not for your incontinence i know it might surprise some of you to see that even in the word of god the word consent is used and i'll say this it keeps coming up my mind as i studied this but you know i don't know what everyone else's take was on it but i thought the me too movement was about time movement it's about time that men be held accountable for their conduct they can't just justify act however they want live however they want say whatever they want yeah men need to be held accountable there's a big headline said men are afraid of hugging women in the workforce now it's like good that's probably a good thing you know don't go around hugging women in the workforce it's good for a man not to touch a woman it's good the bibles teach us such beautiful principles of respecting one another's space and boundaries to where if you just lived a christian life you wouldn't have to worry about a me too movement and so it says this in to defraud naught it means don't withhold affection defraud not by refusing a marriage duty defraud not by withholding affection to to to deny what is due in a marriage is an injustice it's an offense and in this way where you're if you're not rendering due benevolence if you're defrauding your partner in the marriage within this marriage context he there this is an offense this is an injustice it causes harm right there's a breach in the spirit it it's working against uh uh the unity and the harmony the mutual respect of the marriage he says that you defraud naught he says unless there's consent he says so in this you you defraud and you injure unless there's mutual consent that if it's ever by force if it's ever deprived or or forced because it's within someone's power he's saying that there's this there's an injury he says and notice what the logical conclusion of this is you'll be tempted by satan of your because you have incontinence it means taking advantage because of a lack of self-control and to me that immediately just kind of opens up the whole picture in a lot of different ways how self-control is at the root of all of this that in a in a marriage that paul is lifting up he's saying that a woman has power over her husband's body the husband has power over the woman's body this is mutual accountability this is mutual dependency no one has the upper hand no one can force anything so they conduct themselves together through consent not through force and the each one is challenged that am i using emotions am i using power am i using manipulation am i doing something because i want to get my way in this marriage by withholding or by defrauding he's dealing with this all in a way to where this is you're using the liberty for the occasion of the flesh either way you slice it and then the he identifies the error and that kind of behavior that if something is missing something will be sought to take its place question and answers part two question 312 should a saved wife refuse herself to her husband if he is a sinner no sir no sir that's your husband you'll drive him farther away from god than ever by doing that that's right brother sister you married him he's yours and you're his that's exactly what the bible's saying now i know that maybe there's a little bit of an uncomfortable subject and we're looking at our watches saying yeah 45 minutes would have been great um but think about how the bible is speaking to something very personal very intimate and how even in that there's boundaries even in that well you married me as if to say when you signed up for this you signed up for all of it honey so come on get what you asked for like no that it's just because you're married doesn't mean you're free to do whatever you want so he's asked the question the next week question 372 would you please explain first corinthians chapter 7 verses 1 and 9. and and then the way that i would i think the question this is my personal opinion i think they were being asked um asked to explain the all nine of these verses verses one to nine and he has brother neville grabbed the scripture he goes on to another question because he hasn't read it his question he wasn't prepared to answer it and so he has brother neville grab the scripture and then he just kind of looks at it and it's paragraph 304 several paragraphs later he reads verse 2 i believe it is or actually verse 9 he says but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn so he just reads verse 9. he says all right that's for just dirty living and said a man or boy girl or something or another when they're going together and they know that they should be married go ahead and get married i i think you understand what i mean don't you don't just give a dirty little uh a life there because it's not right cohabitation he's talking about that situation where if you're living together and you're sharing intimacy he's saying just get married and and that's it so it seems like he's zeroed in and he's just focused in on verse nine in answering this question but i want you to notice how what he says speaks to the whole part he said that's your sister in one sense where if you're where if you're a christian now if it's the world it's the world dog eat dog think of that context that's how the world lives dog eat dog get yours while you can do unto others before they have a chance to do unto you right they had it coming you gotta you gotta protect yourself you gotta look out for yourself and survival of the fittest he said if it's the world what do you expect you don't expect a man to live with a woman in a way that uh uh addresses her weaknesses and feels her needs and the security and it's very easy for a woman to be bound in a cohabitation and in a sense to where there's this need for protection and there's a need for a and that intimacy is so important she's bound to that person knowing that she's outside the sanctity of marriage but she longs for that protection and that means so much that she's by force and by necessity in that relationship and the mutual promise of to having to hold and to to care and i'm with you till death does part it doesn't exist and that that wounds a spirit there's an offense in that i want you to draw from the things that we're reading earlier that if something is not appropriate there's a cost there's a price you're existing in the danger zone there's a detriment to spirit there's a detriment to faith there's a detriment to conscience there's a detriment to someone's self-value so brother branham is answering all of verses one to nine not just verse nine he says but this girl that you're going with that's your sister too that'll be the mother of your children that'll come don't live a dirty little life around her there there's situations that i'm familiar with in counseling situations that i've had to address whether it be as a as a minister or maybe family situations where i could trace the conduct and behavior within the marriage back to the conduct and behavior in the courtship where there was a there was a violation of virtue there was a disrespect and the woman is dragged into the vow with the feeling of shame and the the mutual respect is never achieved in the marriage until that you address that and and for some people you can't ever do that you're always in exist with this breach in this marriage because deep down inside the woman can't respect the husband for what happened and the husband can't respect the wife for what happened and they never get to a place of mutual respect and guess what the secret of the lord is not there the the what a marriage can be is lacking i know this all of a sudden just maybe got very real but considerate saints consider it he says don't live a dirty life around her this is an admonishment to our young men to conduct yourself the right way in a courtship because there's a price there's a price if we don't when i teach on courtship i have uh there's one goal in a courtship no regrets a successful courtship is not one that ends in engagement a successful courtship is a courtship that ends with no regrets don't live a dirty life around or show that you're a real christian gentleman live like a christian gentleman ought to and treat her like your sister and when you get married married still treat her that way and then he he did detail some things i would encourage you to go back and listen to these other paragraphs uh 305 to 307 but i want to skip just so you can see how he's still answering all these verses and you women live the right way to your husband and you husbands live the right way to your wives live right to your wives be real real nice and respect one another just with he says and your family relations and so forth like that be real nice and respect one or let it just be reverently and godly and agreed with among you and everything as it can be don't never push and shove and be dirty and vulgar understand talk to your wife if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk with her hey guess what this is in the message guess what i didn't have to run down to dr dobson for this i didn't have to go to genre gear in colorado i didn't have to go to gary i didn't have to go to anywhere else to get real wisdom from the word of god that communication is necessary within a marriage understand one another be a real christian gentleman this is so beautiful don't push of it don't be dirty don't be vulgar don't be disrespectful don't be inappropriate but talk to one another understand one another's nature you might be a particular way she might be a particular way and the only way you're ever going to harmonize is to communicate show respect one another you try to do the same thing to him sister and the same way understand one another and be a real christian gentleman a real christian ladies and brother and sister with one another always remember you're god's children and you're from a royal family does this not answer please explain first corinthians 7 1-9 does this not give you the real heart of what you need to navigate versus one to nine the mutual respect the love for one another the communication most problems that we have in relationships come down to a lack of communication or miscommunication it's where it is and why do we not communicate someone sometimes we don't want to get our head bit off right i don't want to say anything because if i do it's going to cause a lot of drama well okay so then you're part to blame right but you realize some some way of interacting has developed that doesn't give doesn't create the right kind of atmosphere to exist harmoniously within our space but now we've been using marriage as a context and i believe it's very direct to us who are married amen i say amen to it praise your brother heron amen i need it and so that nobody thinks i need it i get the most aggressive amens right i say it aggressive yes that's right amen duh sure so it's i i need this but now let's think of it all for all of us think of it for all of us you're from a royal family you should think that way of your spouse what about the person sitting in front of you you're a royal blood there's no blood or better blood in the world than yours that's right a royal blood shows itself that's what it is it's royal show what you are if you really get a hold of that you'll know that you don't ever have to look down on somebody else even if they're not on the seat in front of you show what you are i'm a son of a king i'm the son of the king my wife's a daughter of a king how would i treat that king's daughter how would she treat that king's son he says see what i mean be real genuine how would you treat a king son you'd probably show him respect wouldn't you how would you treat a king's daughter you'd probably probably show her respect god bless you today if we could stand together lord willing wednesday i want to finish this series go ahead and use the subject of respect and identify a maybe back up just a little bit and and i have all the i'm prepared to preach it right now okay i won't um but go revisit the concept of boundaries and barriers again and how how we relate to them and how boundaries to be respected but of barriers to be overcome and that therefore it's important for us to recognize them in our own lives what's a barrier what's a boundary and i haven't preached on this just to make us all cautious like i don't know do they like me do they not like me is this a barrier this is a boundary it's not to make us more reluctant to make us more confident and and then to specifically identify in the scripture how jesus and paul and using different instances that jesus uses and paul uses that word there's a there's an offense recognized and how it's addressed how because jesus talks about trespasses right what's a trespass it's a boundary violation and so he says when your brother trespasses against you he gives you a process of how to handle those and i want to arrive at a conclusion of why why we do that how important it is for us to not violate to for us to be respectful but then how important it is for us to recognize the disrespect and shore up that breach and do the right things and not misunderstand it because there's sometimes turn them over to sit for the destruction of their flesh and let me help in the process and what we really want to see we want to see him get destroyed kind of like jonah what did he want to happen see happen to nineveh why isn't it burning down what's wrong what's happening jonah didn't realize that the word of god was being effective and sometimes i think we turn somebody over to satan for the destruction of the flesh and we get all upset and frustrated when their flesh isn't destroyed but they kind of moderate and come right back and they humble themselves it's like that's the goal that's what we want to achieve and it's so unimportant to recognize it within this context that's just not a bunch of church rules that as a church you know bless god if you don't look toe the line we're going to mark those who act contrary to the gospel that we've been preached and and if you don't act right hit the door if you don't want to toe the line hit the door that's that was never meant for church order as a matter of fact it was some of the most specific things that referenced this was for the individual who's hurt and not the church that is offended it's the individual that's hurt so pray for me i wanted to preach that today but the lord said no [Music] you have to touch on the subject of the use of force instead of love this lack of respect that sometimes we can exhibit to one another when we don't motivate we manipulate thank you so much for your time today thank you for listening heavenly father you know better than i just how remarkable of a congregation was assembled today [Music] lord i look out upon an audience and i see i recognize almost every face and realize that there's some amongst us today that have never been here before [Music] there's some visiting that have visited before and then there's a family that's been assembling itself together now for many months it's what's become a church and somehow lord you by your providence knew just exactly who would be here today you knew who needed to be present in some ways lord perhaps could not be present and you structured a service in a very specific and precise way [Music] and i pray that we could each one in particular so receive this word and may it be instructed to us whether we be a single brother or a single sister whether we be a single father a single mother whether we be a [Music] eligible for married or ineligible whether we be grandparents or parents regardless of who we are there has to be a way that we can search our hearts and take ownership of our royalty and then look upon others [Music] as your creation and know that there's a way that i must conduct myself in the face of their offenses in the face of their sin in the face of their iniquity that could speak to the royalty in their hearts that could awaken a son or daughter of god to conscience and lord i know that we must do it for our own selves we must as royalty defend our kingdom and defend our borders and to defend our hearts and defend our children and we must we must do that but father i i as i share this in my heart now in prayer [Music] most of what is driving me is to recognize we could do more with this light that we have than we are doing and i would want us to be free lord free from restraint free from complex free from fear so now lord i pray for husbands that they could love their wives that wives also could respect their husbands together mutually respecting one another and may we realize that in relationships there must be communion and communication and understanding of one another's nature and what they're comfortable with and respect those respect those things come to an understanding i commit the people to you now lord thanking you for your presence with us in the name lord jesus christ we pray amen amen
