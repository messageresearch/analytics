[0:00] wow just wonderful wonderful scripture
[0:02] reading uh this morning I trust that we
[0:05] can do it some
[0:06] service there's just back up a little
[0:09] bit to last Sunday just very quickly
[0:11] touch on our title and maybe U just
[0:13] maybe give the thesis statement we Ed
[0:15] the phrase and we were using quotations
[0:17] last Sunday I bu homes and the thought
[0:21] behind that is how Satan tricks us into
[0:24] giving up our homes and it's building on
[0:27] that concept what you're looking at now
[0:28] is Wednesday's title but Monday was I by
[0:30] homes a little bit more Sinister view of
[0:33] the devil approaching a door to buy a bu
[0:35] a home and how that the concept of a
[0:38] home is different than the house the
[0:40] physical structure and we're bringing
[0:42] that out of the message of the hour
[0:43] brother brandham says it's the character
[0:44] it's the order of the family that makes
[0:47] a home it's not just how the house and
[0:49] how beautiful it is but this here was
[0:52] what we ministered on Wednesday night
[0:53] gaining the world but losing your home
[0:56] and we are specifically looking at how
[0:59] that we can exchange change that concept
[1:01] of home the the rest and the peace and
[1:03] the Comfort the togetherness and the
[1:05] things that we can experience and enjoy
[1:07] in home we can exchange that for things
[1:09] of the world and how that Satan is
[1:11] transacting with us the world our own
[1:14] emotions however you want to use uh the
[1:17] adversary in this context or the
[1:19] protagonist but there's something an
[1:21] antagonist there's something happening
[1:23] where we're giving up things that God
[1:25] has promised us to given to us to enjoy
[1:27] we're kind of giving that up for things
[1:28] of the world and I want you to think in
[1:31] your minds about a
[1:33] transaction where we're exchanging value
[1:36] where there's consideration on both
[1:37] sides where you're being offered
[1:39] something and since you're you're
[1:40] gaining something this is an important
[1:42] concept to hold on to here in the
[1:43] beginning you're gaining something
[1:45] because you say how what would it profit
[1:46] if we gain the world but lose our soul
[1:49] so you're gaining something but think
[1:51] you cannot gain in this transaction
[1:54] without giving something else up so this
[1:56] is not something freely given when you
[1:58] transact in this economy I mean uh
[2:00] there's an exchange of value where
[2:01] you're receiving consideration you're
[2:03] giving consideration and we believe or
[2:06] I'm what I'm suggesting or at least
[2:08] wanting you to consider that
[2:09] transactions are happening on a daily
[2:11] basis they'd either build up your home
[2:13] or tear it down and the physical
[2:15] structure Remains the Same but yet
[2:17] there's something in the atmosphere and
[2:18] the spirit and the togetherness and the
[2:20] welcomeness of Christ that is lost we
[2:23] use the phrase peace by peace just to
[2:24] talk about uh maybe broking breaking out
[2:27] things but even rest and peace and
[2:28] comfort and joy we're exchanging that
[2:30] for other emotions and Sensations and
[2:33] experiences in the world and so if we're
[2:36] to possess our Promised Land step by
[2:39] step inch by inch foot by foot then I
[2:41] believe we can lose the Same by the way
[2:43] that we Retreat or the way that we
[2:45] exchange until uh the hole can be gone
[2:49] and I'll say this before we uh
[2:51] transition to this morning service
[2:53] there's things about home that are not
[2:55] for sale our home should not be for sale
[2:58] there's there's the home life is not not
[3:00] negotiable that when it comes to a job
[3:02] offer or an opportunity and things
[3:04] present themselves there should be a
[3:06] vision for home life that you say this
[3:08] is not on the table I'm not negotiate my
[3:11] quality time with my family I'm not
[3:13] going to negotiate um our our ability to
[3:15] serve the Lord and his people I'm not
[3:17] going to I'm not going to compromise
[3:19] home life in exchange for a better
[3:21] salary or better something else that
[3:22] that's something that is not negotiable
[3:25] and I'm not willing to trade it for
[3:26] anything there's going to be great
[3:28] transactions that can be offered say
[3:30] well here's $10 million if you go do
[3:32] this and go do that and you think man
[3:34] and it's only for a
[3:36] year after that year's over we'll have
[3:38] enough money to go back or do this and
[3:40] do that and your mind you rationalize
[3:42] and you convince yourself that you can
[3:45] handle it but yet you're giving
[3:46] something up in the process and what
[3:48] this what the statement Jesus is saying
[3:50] is you could gain the whole world and
[3:52] lose your soul and we're saying gaining
[3:55] the whole world and losing your home and
[3:56] he says what can a man give in exchange
[3:59] for his soul in other words there's
[4:00] things that you might barter that what
[4:02] you get if you give it up you don't get
[4:04] what you gave up back does that make
[4:07] sense is that riddled enough you give
[4:09] something up to get gain but you can't
[4:12] return the gain right and get back what
[4:15] you get got when you gave it to the
[4:16] getter you can't get it back it's going
[4:19] to require something else and I believe
[4:21] we can get it back through humility and
[4:23] submission to the Lord and asking for
[4:25] his forgiveness but recognize in that
[4:27] exchange whatever you give up for Val
[4:29] you to receive gain in this world you
[4:32] can't just quit the job or move back or
[4:34] do certain things to figure it out and
[4:36] get that
[4:37] back and and I that principle will'll
[4:40] come back to here in a little bit in
[4:41] terms
[4:42] of we're not so much wanting to deal
[4:44] with how to get that back but we're
[4:45] wanting to learn how to live a life to
[4:47] where we don't lose those things so my
[4:49] title today is a mortgaged home and
[4:51] everybody with the mortgage is
[4:54] like man rates these days I was just
[4:57] looking at you know I lost my car in an
[4:59] accident so thinking about trying to get
[5:01] a car just figuring out how much $300
[5:04] can get me and uh and I was looking at
[5:07] interest rates on used cars I'm like
[5:09] what this is uh it's the mafia that's
[5:12] running the mortgage industry these days
[5:14] these prices should be
[5:16] illegal but uh when I use the phrase a
[5:19] mortgaged home I want to say we may not
[5:22] completely sell our home and again home
[5:24] refers to home life and we're not
[5:26] talking about literally selling a house
[5:28] or mortgaging your lit house but I'm
[5:31] wanting to use this concept to where we
[5:32] may not sell our homes that's not
[5:35] negotiable and since we've already
[5:37] addressed that kind of teed that up a
[5:38] little bit in some of our review of the
[5:40] last two services and that really is a
[5:42] review of a lot of other themes we've
[5:43] been using that maybe we don't sell it
[5:46] but what are the ways that we burden it
[5:48] what are the ways that we enter into
[5:50] some sort of negotiation where we just
[5:53] mortgage the home so it's burdened and
[5:55] it's weighed down and most of you are
[5:58] familiar with what a mortgage is we even
[6:00] will won't get into detail in terms of
[6:02] the law and the phrase uh the phrasing
[6:05] and the atmology of it necessarily but
[6:08] we understand it in modern terms that a
[6:10] mortgage is used to buy a house in this
[6:14] case we could say maybe a home or it's
[6:16] it would be used traditionally to buy a
[6:18] house uh and I want to build on that
[6:20] concept I I'm building on that knowledge
[6:22] that you I'm supposing you already have
[6:24] that whenever a mortgage is you're
[6:26] living in a house and you call it your
[6:27] own but you had to borrow money in order
[6:29] to possess it and to be able to have
[6:31] your name somewhere on the deed The
[6:33] Twist I want to use is when negotiating
[6:35] that mortgage or giving that mortgage
[6:38] and giving that security document what
[6:40] are you getting in the transaction what
[6:42] are the terms of that transaction and
[6:44] what does it mean for us as
[6:46] Believers now I want to uh I'm going
[6:48] have to cut in on where we were on
[6:50] Wednesday night uh and where we had to
[6:52] leave off but we're talking about what
[6:53] we make the world may call postmodern
[6:55] Society they're able to just to divide
[6:57] up where we are socially and things and
[6:59] politically but that leodan age and the
[7:02] attitude of leoda there's a lust brother
[7:04] BR showed us there's a Lust For worldly
[7:06] knowledge and once we have worldly
[7:08] knowledge it desires to experience that
[7:10] it's not just as much it's not about
[7:11] getting data but it's applying the data
[7:13] it's not just about knowing something
[7:15] but it's living it out and experiencing
[7:16] it and so the world is feeding us
[7:19] knowledge and the devil's preaching his
[7:21] sermon again and his eeden uh a
[7:23] knowledge of lust a lust knowledge a
[7:26] lust Veil and it brings us into
[7:28] experience and so so this Western
[7:30] Civilization this leot toan society that
[7:32] governs the entire world of those those
[7:35] social institutions of competition and
[7:38] Science and the rule of law and modern
[7:39] medicine and consumerism and work ethic
[7:42] these are all institutions that we
[7:44] engage in as human beings we participate
[7:47] in where there's some sort of
[7:48] transacting there's some sort of
[7:49] participation and it's all a part of
[7:52] Satan's economy in the end time in Luke
[7:54] chapter 17 Jesus called it planting and
[7:57] buying and selling and building and
[7:59] eating drinking and and and all these
[8:01] different details of just regular
[8:02] commonness regular daily lives things we
[8:04] do every day but those are the things
[8:06] that Jesus wanted to stand out when he
[8:09] talked about the day when the son of man
[8:11] is revealed and so if it's buying and
[8:14] selling planting and building eating and
[8:16] drinking and all those things that
[8:18] relate to the normal course of human
[8:20] events on a daily basis and he says but
[8:23] then at that same time the son of man is
[8:25] going to be revealed there ought to be
[8:27] that which has the preeminence in our
[8:29] lives and not the other Amen brother
[8:32] brandham says in Satan's Eden this is a
[8:33] great time everybody has money everybody
[8:35] can do this everybody can do that money
[8:37] is Flowing every way big cars and
[8:39] everything and then it really is just
[8:42] the uh uh the Leo de Sea and the rich
[8:45] and increase with goods and there's a
[8:47] lot of lot of things that we have even
[8:49] as we pointed out before even people who
[8:51] can be uh poverty or low income still
[8:54] have more today than what people had 100
[8:56] years
[8:57] ago and so we have a lot
[9:00] and the uh and one of the things that we
[9:03] mentioned on Wednesday is how that home
[9:05] life has been perverted to such a large
[9:07] degree to where the things that used to
[9:10] be relate to home are watered down the
[9:13] things that used to bring a family
[9:15] together that a family fellowshipped
[9:16] around that a family had in common are
[9:18] devalued and have been overtaken by
[9:20] other things just the the the
[9:23] multiplicity of rooms and how it used to
[9:25] be a place you slept but now it's where
[9:26] you do school it's where you do your
[9:27] homework it's everything is done in that
[9:30] place the kitchen is not just a place
[9:31] for the family to gather around for meal
[9:33] time and prayer and devotions but it's
[9:35] used for homeschool it's used for work
[9:36] it's used for a lot of other things and
[9:38] a and every room in the house can be
[9:40] invaded by technology and media and
[9:42] movies and all sorts of things and so
[9:44] there's a little bit less sanctification
[9:46] of our dwellings uh uh our homes have
[9:49] been invaded by the internet and it has
[9:51] been uh thank you Al Gore and there's
[9:53] been a lot of things that have happened
[9:55] in our homes that have robbed us of time
[9:58] togetherness a and even a knowing of one
[10:01] another and this is a statement I came
[10:04] across some time ago that just uh and it
[10:07] was written I think by an English
[10:09] publication so it the the wording don't
[10:11] get lost in the what it what it says it
[10:13] says the web is another castle that the
[10:15] English man can live in so the web is
[10:18] another castle that the American the we
[10:20] the web is another house uh domain that
[10:23] a human can live in and he seeks to
[10:26] create virtual places that have as much
[10:28] effect on Pride self-esteem and identity
[10:32] as the bricks and mortar version where
[10:35] he
[10:36] sleeps so we have a world that we
[10:40] interact in and have Commerce in and we
[10:42] have things that we enjoy and
[10:43] participate in things that we are
[10:45] knowledgeable of things that we can have
[10:49] uh I mean there was a time when you
[10:50] learn things in print and it took some
[10:52] time to happen and yet they managed to
[10:54] get it out there for hundreds of years
[10:56] people knew things that were happening
[10:58] and you use some imagin and it was
[11:00] Consolidated to things that could be
[11:01] printed in Word of Mouth but now we
[11:03] could be witnessing in real time events
[11:06] that are happening in the Middle East
[11:07] and events that are happening all over
[11:08] North America and so we're drawn into
[11:11] this larger ecosystem and we're all
[11:13] hearing the same sound bites and we're
[11:15] all being told the same thing and
[11:17] sometimes uh groups are being told one
[11:19] thing and the other groups being told
[11:20] another and the chasm between us uh gets
[11:22] even larger but it points out that now
[11:25] there are things that we consider part
[11:28] of our reality
[11:29] in home or our existence a a virt a
[11:33] castle that is a virtual place that have
[11:36] just as much impact on our pride
[11:38] self-esteem and identity as the place we
[11:42] actually live and the people we actually
[11:45] are related to and interact with on a
[11:46] daily
[11:48] basis we are now the statement is we are
[11:50] now we read this Wednesday we are now in
[11:52] the process of negotiating new
[11:54] boundaries with our time our attentions
[11:57] and our domestic hierarchies and this is
[11:59] happening over and over and over again
[12:01] and I mentioned this so that it it kind
[12:03] of resonates with this concept of
[12:05] bringing our back our homes back under
[12:07] the token and and letting Christ have
[12:09] the preeminence in our daily lives is
[12:11] that we're TR we're negotiating new
[12:13] boundaries with technology with media
[12:16] with entertainment with games with all
[12:17] sorts of things with podcast and books
[12:20] you name it we're negotiating new
[12:21] boundaries with our time our attention
[12:24] and domestic relationships in
[12:26] order and so this is how home life is
[12:28] being impacted today home life meant
[12:31] something at one time now that it kind
[12:33] of expands to where it has these
[12:35] multiple dimensions and Realties and now
[12:38] you can just wear headsets and and
[12:40] augment your present reality with
[12:42] virtual things a and people will enjoy
[12:45] that more than the real thing virtual
[12:47] reality is not reality it's virtual it's
[12:50] it's it's augmented it's artificial and
[12:53] yet we interact in it and people will
[12:54] enjoy that more than the skin and bones
[12:56] and the actual tactile things that are
[12:58] real
[13:00] in the sermon a trumpet gives an
[13:01] uncertain sound brother bam says we find
[13:03] immorality on the Move in our homes he
[13:07] says in one place our markets are full
[13:08] of Filth and he's actually bringing it
[13:10] into the home and how our homes are full
[13:11] of Filth it was astounding to find out a
[13:14] great percent on the survey of the
[13:16] nation I believe it was in Ohio of
[13:20] course it amazing just how God I'm just
[13:24] kidding just I believe it was in Ohio
[13:27] well there's a lot of Ohioans here right
[13:29] raise your hand if you've lived in Ohio
[13:33] look at this look at this Glory we have
[13:36] a quorum let's conduct
[13:38] business it was a a survey in Ohio was
[13:41] taken of Christianity and it was
[13:42] alarming what a percent that did not
[13:44] even go to church now have some of you
[13:47] read and heard some of this uh the
[13:48] surveys how fewer people are identifying
[13:51] as Christian and how that it's really
[13:53] outstanding nowadays they're saying that
[13:55] the the number of people who identify
[13:57] with Christian the percentage that ident
[13:59] IFI Christianity that don't go to church
[14:01] is getting higher and higher and higher
[14:03] so Christianity in North America is
[14:05] becoming less and less and and then the
[14:08] percentage of those that actually go to
[14:10] church is becoming uh less and less so
[14:13] there's a now a kind of an Evangelical
[14:16] Christianity and more of a politicized
[14:18] Christianity where they they don't go to
[14:21] church anymore they they they're more
[14:22] interested in going to polling booths or
[14:23] Trump rallies and so there's a little
[14:25] bit there's a different church now for
[14:27] them there's a different Gathering Place
[14:29] and the brother brandham is bringing
[14:30] this out in
[14:31] 1963 how that there's a percentage of
[14:34] Christians that don't go to church he
[14:35] says about 80% of those that went to
[14:37] church didn't even know why they
[14:41] went now that's
[14:43] something there's 80% that go to church
[14:46] so if you you have Christians that go to
[14:48] church and of those that actually go to
[14:51] church he's saying there's only 20% who
[14:53] know why they're going now if you apply
[14:55] that today now that you have
[14:57] Christianity dwindling and the number of
[14:59] people that's going to church to I say
[15:01] there's even fewer today that know why
[15:03] they go to
[15:04] church they don't know why they go they
[15:07] just go to church why do you go well
[15:09] mother took us when she we was a kid and
[15:11] we just keep on
[15:13] going and I know in our minds we think
[15:15] denominations we think Baptist we think
[15:17] Methodist but do you realize this is so
[15:19] now in the message that when we've gone
[15:22] this many decades in the message and
[15:24] that we have fourth and fifth generation
[15:26] uh uh being raised in message churches
[15:28] that in the same way we can just be
[15:30] going to the church that Mom and Dad
[15:33] went to and their mom and dad went to
[15:35] and their mom and dad went to so this is
[15:37] just where we go to
[15:39] church and a lot of people will be born
[15:41] in a church be raised in a church never
[15:44] leave that church and never even ask
[15:45] themselves why am I in this
[15:48] church why why do we come here all the
[15:51] time and it doesn't it it it's not
[15:53] rhetorical in the sense that if you
[15:54] asked yourself that question you would
[15:56] leave but you would ask yourself that
[15:58] question to know why you stay to know
[16:01] why you're
[16:04] going he said now another percent of
[16:06] that said they just went just for o to
[16:08] meet their neighbors and talk a while he
[16:11] says why it's alarming and notice the
[16:13] connection he makes no wonder the home
[16:15] life is gone any home life that's not
[16:18] stable home life is gone there's an
[16:20] instability in home life because there's
[16:22] a lack of vision in those that are
[16:24] managing the home that are leading the
[16:26] home there's a lack of understanding of
[16:28] what spiritual things are for
[16:29] Christianity now has been reduced to
[16:32] going to church and this going to church
[16:34] doesn't have any meaning or real purpose
[16:36] and then even those who can answer the
[16:38] question say I'm just going for the
[16:39] social part and if you think that that
[16:42] only pertains to denominations it's an
[16:44] attitude in a spirit that still persists
[16:46] today where I'm sure that we can all
[16:48] especially the Neighbors in the
[16:49] apartment next door they just go to
[16:51] church for the Social Gospel they go to
[16:53] church for the social things not that
[16:55] the gospel's social but really at the
[16:57] end of the day what's keeping them is
[16:59] their social position and their social
[17:00] standing with other people who are
[17:02] listening to the same gospel that's
[17:04] being preached and it's not deeply
[17:06] impacting their souls and their
[17:08] lives brother brah says immorality is on
[17:11] the Move in our homes because of these
[17:13] things that are being let down and these
[17:15] things that being slipped and the vision
[17:16] and the uh and the awareness and wisdom
[17:18] in the home and he said home life is
[17:20] gone it's not
[17:21] stable then in the the uncertain sound
[17:24] he says' notice in this day the home
[17:25] life has become a situation that ought
[17:27] to be dealt with you see little boys
[17:29] going out and taking a rifle and
[17:31] shooting Papa and Mommy while they're
[17:32] laying in
[17:33] bed this these types of events are
[17:35] becoming more and more frequent more
[17:37] common and they're they're more
[17:40] pervasive uh there was uh I remember
[17:43] there was a time and I mean I want to
[17:46] mention even though it's been maybe like
[17:47] 20 over 20 years since this happened but
[17:49] there was a there was an uptick and a
[17:51] rash in school
[17:53] shootings uh that spun up at a
[17:55] particular time and at the time it was
[17:56] unprecedented the numbers that had taken
[17:58] place place and and I remember just in
[18:01] studying these are the things that just
[18:02] stood out to me this is just my own
[18:03] personal uh thing that stood out to me
[18:06] and and there was right at the same time
[18:09] that this started I think it was Sprite
[18:11] and I'm not preaching against clear
[18:13] sodas but they came out with a A slogan
[18:16] and a ad campaign called generation
[18:19] next and it was maybe early 2000s or
[18:22] something just and it coincided with the
[18:23] exact same thing and and at that time I
[18:26] came across a statement where brother
[18:27] bam said it used to be that young people
[18:29] would play a prank on You by putting
[18:30] your Carriage up in a tree or something
[18:32] like that they the pranks he says but
[18:35] now they'll just shoot you and he said
[18:37] that's the Next Generation and to me it
[18:40] just stood out to me here we are
[18:42] generation next has been announced we're
[18:43] in that season we're we're in that time
[18:45] we now uh uh you know the payback and
[18:49] revenge and pranks and those things it's
[18:51] just escalated to the point to where now
[18:54] uh murders are common school shootings
[18:56] are common a and those things
[18:59] are are just becoming so pervasive in a
[19:01] a present reality he says dishonesty
[19:04] amongst women and men our mothers and
[19:06] fathers so now we we want to think not
[19:09] so much where he goes in this where he
[19:10] begins to talk about infidelity and
[19:12] promiscuous relationships but just
[19:14] dishonesty and
[19:16] Parenthood uh parents to children and
[19:18] and our dishonesty and the way that we
[19:20] mislead them the hypocrisy that we
[19:22] broadcast to them when we say one thing
[19:23] and do another in lots of big cities the
[19:26] husband and wife pack secret keys or
[19:28] same keys pass keys to their apartment
[19:30] each one comes in eat a meal
[19:33] somewhere and one's got a date the other
[19:35] one's got a date now in our minds you
[19:39] think wow that that's uh we know what
[19:41] he's saying most of us understand what
[19:43] he's saying but how can we basically be
[19:46] doing the same thing H where we have a
[19:49] commitment we have hobbies we have
[19:51] things we do and it's just things are
[19:52] being
[19:53] fragmented and he says have no more uh
[19:56] have no more decency no specs at home
[20:00] homes in these days don't have the
[20:02] oldfashioned homes he says might too
[20:04] many doesn't have where the Bible is
[20:05] open dad reads a chapter and they kneel
[20:08] around the table and pray people go in
[20:11] sit down and eat just I saying people
[20:14] will go to the table and just start
[20:15] jamming or jaming and slopping around
[20:18] eating never ask the blessing he goes I
[20:21] don't mean to make this a joke I want to
[20:23] say it for a point I noticed one time it
[20:24] was out when we was living on the farm
[20:26] they was under they was under a hog
[20:29] under an apple tree and them apples was
[20:31] falling off and hitting them on the head
[20:32] and he eat apples all day long and he
[20:35] never did look up to see where they was
[20:37] coming from that's right well that don't
[20:39] only go on
[20:42] Hogs now if we're talking about daily
[20:45] living without ever uh without ever
[20:48] recognizing why you're doing it feeding
[20:51] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[20:53] man Fellowship in where the son of man
[20:55] is being revealed if we have that kind
[20:56] of jun toos of two things buying selling
[20:59] planting building eating and drinking
[21:01] and these things and the revealing of
[21:02] the son of man there's a life that's
[21:05] being lived and you're never looking up
[21:08] to see Christ never asking yourself why
[21:11] do we go to church he says you don't
[21:14] realize where that food comes from you
[21:16] better look up and thank God for it
[21:18] because he was the one who gave it and
[21:21] so he says we don't have no more
[21:23] security of the home so we're talking
[21:26] about security rest a peaceful peace
[21:28] peble habitation a sure dwelling a quiet
[21:31] resting place because it's always
[21:33] uncertain it's always uneasy it's
[21:35] subject to the whims of of things that
[21:37] are viral it's subject to The Winds of
[21:39] Winds of entertainment and the whims of
[21:41] the world no more security he says send
[21:43] your children to school what do they
[21:45] teach them out there many times too many
[21:47] times they teach them that we come from
[21:50] apes and I guess at least then there was
[21:53] male and female ape right now I mean how
[21:56] many apes are there he says well we
[21:58] don't believe that no and if a man's no
[22:00] more than an
[22:02] animal or a man or a woman or or or or
[22:05] uh if they them are no more than an
[22:08] animal then eat drink and be
[22:12] married if that's all we are we're all
[22:15] existed on some Spectrum if it's
[22:17] whatever you want to make yourself to be
[22:18] and whatever you want to imagine
[22:20] yourself to be whatever reality whatever
[22:22] Castle you want to call your domain he
[22:24] said if that's it then just eat drink
[22:26] and be merry that's what makes so many
[22:28] juven
[22:29] delinquents what makes so many juvenile
[22:31] delinquents is when there's not a vision
[22:33] in the home right we always talk about
[22:35] television in the home you better
[22:37] be right you better be telling the
[22:40] vision you better be telling the things
[22:41] of God you better be telling about this
[22:43] revealing of the son of man there there
[22:45] better be things that are lifted up
[22:46] otherwise we have juvenile delinquents
[22:48] because they like I go to church why
[22:49] because my mom takes
[22:51] me would you go to church if your
[22:52] parents didn't take you
[22:55] no right and because and and that then
[22:58] that's when the heads begin to butt a
[23:00] little bit and an adolesence where it's
[23:02] like do I have to go do I have to go and
[23:04] then you say no one time and then it
[23:06] gets easier and easier to then you know
[23:08] Mom and Dad and the younger ones are
[23:10] going to church and the older ones are
[23:11] staying at home and it's just a matter
[23:14] of time they come every once in a while
[23:15] they come every once a while then
[23:16] eventually you don't ever see them
[23:18] again right and you know why it's not
[23:20] because they weren't seed on it's not
[23:23] because their parents weren't Believers
[23:26] it's let me just say this could it be
[23:29] that the parents never fully appreciated
[23:31] the gravity of the responsibility of
[23:33] training up a child in the way that he
[23:35] should go and when the heads begin to
[23:36] butt about going to church we didn't
[23:38] just say well there's a prophet in this
[23:40] hour who came and he said that we go to
[23:42] church and we go
[23:45] early and it's like well you're you're
[23:48] never there early well do as I say not
[23:51] as I do
[23:52] knucklehead right and then what do the
[23:55] kids think can I please just stay home
[23:57] tonight I got a lot of homework it's
[23:59] like I'll let you this time right and
[24:03] then the next time the bad the the meas
[24:05] instead of
[24:06] saying let let's talk more about this
[24:10] I'm not just going to church because um
[24:12] you know it's it's my favorite thing to
[24:14] do and and because I'm getting a bunch
[24:16] of worldly things out of it I go to
[24:18] church because there's a world that
[24:20] we're living in and I've had an
[24:22] experience that feeds my soul and
[24:23] there's a want to deep down inside my
[24:25] soul sometimes I'm tired sometimes I'm
[24:27] anxious some sometimes I've got a lot of
[24:29] work sometimes I don't necessarily feel
[24:31] on top of my game sometimes I feel like
[24:33] a hypocrite sometimes there's
[24:34] disagreement in the home and we've got
[24:36] to get together as a family and sit next
[24:37] to each other and drive 30 minutes to
[24:39] church or an hour we do it and Son the
[24:41] reason why we do it is because I've
[24:43] lived a life of sin I know what it is to
[24:45] be broken I know what it is to be
[24:46] hopeless and this is the place that has
[24:48] fulfilled every longing in my heart and
[24:50] begin to have honest talks with our
[24:52] children about what matters about why we
[24:54] go to church and why we've made the hard
[24:56] decisions we've made and you you never
[24:57] know if the son and or daughter in that
[24:59] instance might be like well you've never
[25:01] put it like
[25:03] that what are we waiting for I didn't I
[25:06] didn't I didn't know that cuz I've got
[25:08] friends at school who just go and I've
[25:11] got friends at school that got all sorts
[25:12] of programs and when the parents are in
[25:14] there listening to the Bible teaching
[25:15] they get to hang out at the coffee shop
[25:17] and there's all sorts of things so I I I
[25:19] I never knew listen I'm talking about
[25:21] how we've got to go beyond the surface
[25:24] of just looking like good message
[25:26] families and really getting into to the
[25:28] revealing of the son of man to know that
[25:30] we've got we we have juvenile
[25:32] delinquents because the the vision is
[25:36] delinquent right we're not telling them
[25:38] they're not an we're not telling them
[25:40] they're more than an animal you're more
[25:41] than a human you're more than just a
[25:43] some ordinary teenager passing through
[25:45] this world you you've got calling you've
[25:47] got purpose you've got
[25:50] gifts he said that's what makes so many
[25:52] crimes committed because if people are
[25:54] no more than an animal it makes them act
[25:55] like an animal
[25:58] I about to think somebody doesn't want
[26:00] me to preach today because I didn't find
[26:01] I couldn't see the water
[26:07] bottle we got to tell him he's a Son of
[26:10] God born for the kingdom of God and he
[26:14] is
[26:18] somebody Daddy I don't want to go to
[26:20] church I don't want to be a
[26:22] hypocrite child if you walk out that
[26:24] door and go into the world that's when
[26:25] you're the hypocrite
[26:28] in the family of God in the you're in
[26:30] Christ is the only place you're not a
[26:31] hypocrite because you're born for the
[26:33] kingdom of God Daddy I don't want to do
[26:35] that I want to go a different way I want
[26:37] to I want to do this I want to do that
[26:39] son I I can't at a certain point I can't
[26:40] fight you you're going to do what you
[26:41] want to do but I want you to know you're
[26:43] somebody you're somebody I can be proud
[26:45] of you're somebody that's got gold down
[26:47] inside of you you're somebody that's got
[26:48] gifts and talents you're somebody that
[26:49] has a call of God over your life and and
[26:51] we we have that Vision when we're
[26:53] dealing with those that we love that I'm
[26:55] not going to get Negative I'm not going
[26:57] to get costic I'm not going to get nasty
[26:59] but I want the love of Christ to be
[27:00] projected so it can be still yet a
[27:02] guiding force if that's the path that
[27:04] they want to take a protective Force I
[27:07] hope there's a picture that's being
[27:09] painted so you can understand where
[27:10] we're going with this change in our home
[27:15] life in Revelations
[27:18] 3:18 this is the anecdote to the leodan
[27:21] attitude I counsel thee to buy of me
[27:23] gold tried in the fire brother bam said
[27:25] that gold tried in the fire is the gold
[27:27] of God the gold of God is a Christlike
[27:30] character produced in the fiery furnace
[27:32] of Affliction that's what we want we
[27:34] want Christlike character that's the
[27:36] gold of God and he says that thou mayest
[27:39] be rich in white rment that thou mayest
[27:42] be clothed brother Bram said there's a
[27:44] price to pay for those garments and it's
[27:46] the price of
[27:47] separation and that the shame of thy
[27:49] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[27:51] eyes with isav that thou mayest
[27:55] see this Leo Dean economy if we looked
[27:58] at it historically there's a lot of
[28:00] connections to the gold and to the
[28:01] clothing and to the isav and and there's
[28:04] a lot of historical connections that
[28:06] give this even maybe a little bit more
[28:09] context uh uh to understand why these
[28:12] words would be chosen directly to this
[28:14] church church age but when we think
[28:16] about Babylon and its Commerce and its
[28:19] economy and it's buying and selling and
[28:21] all those things it's remarkable that
[28:24] when we're rich and increase with Goods
[28:25] by our own self-estimation the spirit
[28:27] that exists on the age and Society at
[28:29] large whether you're believe in God or
[28:31] not it's the spirit on the
[28:34] age that he would then off offer some
[28:37] other economy or some other transaction
[28:40] I counsel thee to buy of me and he says
[28:44] gold clothing and
[28:46] isv this is this is his counsel brother
[28:49] B says the counsel of God is tur it is
[28:51] to the point he directs this last day
[28:54] Church to one hope that hope is himself
[28:57] amen he says come to me and by it is
[29:01] evident from this phrase by of me that
[29:05] the Le and church is not at all dealing
[29:07] with Jesus for the spiritual products of
[29:10] the kingdom of God their transactions
[29:14] cannot be
[29:15] spiritual now I want to use the the
[29:18] diagnosis he's having on the church age
[29:20] or the church nominal and their
[29:22] lukewarmness and their transactions in a
[29:25] religious nature and their Theology and
[29:27] their Church Ord and those things and
[29:29] how that he's saying that they're not
[29:30] dealing with Jesus for the spiritual
[29:33] products of the kingdom of God so they
[29:35] have their own religious Kingdom that
[29:37] they're buying and selling in and that
[29:38] they're supporting with their their
[29:40] belief in the doctrine and with their
[29:41] efforts and they're giving a and there's
[29:43] that realm where we've heard a voice of
[29:45] Revelations 18:4 say come out of her so
[29:47] we've left that economy so we've left
[29:49] the religious economy but now I want to
[29:52] apply this in some way to the more
[29:54] subtle economy of how that Satan is
[29:56] still attacking Our lives our our minds
[29:58] our bodies Our attention and our time
[30:00] where he's wanting us to interact not so
[30:02] much to support the Catholic church and
[30:04] the mark of the beast but just to busy
[30:06] ourselves with worldly things and how
[30:09] that there's can still be a lot of
[30:11] transactions that we're engaging in that
[30:14] that are separate and apart from Christ
[30:18] that do not benefit the kingdom of God
[30:20] being built in our own lives so he says
[30:22] their transactions cannot be
[30:26] spiritual so I I want you to begin to
[30:29] think even on an applicable way on a
[30:31] daily basis about spiritual
[30:34] transactions they may think that they
[30:36] are spiritual but how can they be the
[30:37] works in their midst are definitely not
[30:39] as Paul would say God in you willing and
[30:41] doing of his own good pleasure
[30:43] Philippians 21:13 thus what about all
[30:46] these churches schools hospitals
[30:48] missionary Ventures God is not in them
[30:51] as long as they are denominational seed
[30:52] and spirit and not the seed and spirit
[30:55] of God I'll just let that linger in case
[30:58] you need to take a
[30:59] picture there's no life in
[31:02] it and it it cannot bring forth it's a
[31:06] very important principle of the the word
[31:07] of God why why the things why things
[31:10] took place the way that they did is to
[31:11] to come back to Christ and out of these
[31:13] systems that have kept the people from
[31:15] Christ but the idea is that transactions
[31:18] that I'm want you to catch a hold of
[31:20] what brother Bram saying here I hope is
[31:21] evident Christ himself is the only hope
[31:25] and that Jesus has to be
[31:28] the one you're transacting with for the
[31:30] spiritual products of the kingdom of God
[31:32] so Christ has to be the one that you're
[31:34] negotiating not negotiating but you're
[31:36] transacting with he has to be the one
[31:38] that's giving he has to be the one that
[31:41] you're gaining from and you want to
[31:44] understand what you're what you're
[31:45] giving in that and what that entails and
[31:49] what things are freely given and what
[31:51] things we do to show a show of Love Back
[31:53] to him and so these Spirit the lack of
[31:56] spiritual transactions
[31:58] are result in the L de and condition or
[32:01] this L deing condition is evident in
[32:03] these the lack of spiritual
[32:07] transactions I would argue that this is
[32:09] how immortality excuse me immorality is
[32:12] on the Move in our homes and how home
[32:14] life has become a situation that must be
[32:16] dealt
[32:17] with 1 Timothy chap 6: 6 to10 I think
[32:21] this is where we'll we'll just be
[32:23] weaving in and out of this this for the
[32:25] remainder of our time today
[32:28] 1 Timothy chapter 6 we'll read verses 6
[32:30] to1 and maybe work in some U some quot
[32:35] quotations in
[32:37] here and and I know I'm jumping into
[32:39] this but we'll back up to some of these
[32:41] other verses and jump forward to others
[32:42] but godliness with contentment is great
[32:45] gain remember this I want to revisit
[32:47] this before we're done godliness with
[32:50] contentment is great gain the world is
[32:53] going to offer you something in these
[32:55] transactions that are being dealt with
[32:57] these transactions that we're engaging
[32:58] in something's being offered to us so
[33:00] we're going to receive something
[33:02] consideration from the world and we're
[33:04] going to give up something in exchange
[33:06] for that and we might consider that gain
[33:11] great gain right large
[33:14] money and but this is saying godliness
[33:17] with contentment is great gain for we
[33:19] brought nothing into this world and to
[33:21] certain we can carry nothing out now
[33:24] that's
[33:25] a a powerful statement we didn't come
[33:29] into this world with a lot of stuff and
[33:31] you're not going to be able to take your
[33:33] stuff with you right naked you came in
[33:36] essentially there's going to be a a
[33:38] nakedness that you're going to go you
[33:40] can't take something that was man-made
[33:42] something material back with you the
[33:45] only thing you take is your
[33:48] character and that's a character that
[33:50] Christ I believe I'm saying this for the
[33:51] believe that's a character that Christ
[33:52] has
[33:53] formed and what you leave is your legacy
[34:00] and having food and rment let us be
[34:02] therewith
[34:04] content now having something to eat and
[34:07] something to wear be happy and could you
[34:09] just imagine if we told our kids that we
[34:11] told everyone that told our wives that
[34:13] wives told the husband you know honey I
[34:15] could really use this it's like are you
[34:17] dressed are you
[34:19] fed right and so we could really could
[34:21] really have a lot of fun with this you
[34:23] know I really really want to do this
[34:25] well you got clothes on and your belly's
[34:26] full be happy
[34:29] and and it said in other words there's a
[34:30] certain basis of
[34:34] contentment there there's a certain
[34:36] measure of Necessities I he's not just
[34:38] saying food and clothing be happy saying
[34:40] but if the Necessities are met if the
[34:43] provision you need to fulfill your
[34:45] responsibilities and some have greater
[34:47] responsibilities than others uh some may
[34:49] live there's there's some Believers that
[34:51] live in economies in parts of country
[34:53] even in Europe where they don't need to
[34:54] own a car cuz they can take public
[34:56] transportation doesn't mean they're poor
[34:58] doesn't mean they can't handle it it's
[34:59] just they don't have to and and so
[35:02] there's some Believers that don't have
[35:03] to own certain things and engage in
[35:05] certain things and they their calling
[35:06] will never have them travel this way or
[35:08] go get a degree and a lot of those
[35:10] different uh things and so it's just a
[35:12] matter of being in your calling and
[35:14] appreciating the resources you need
[35:16] necessary to fulfill that calling in
[35:19] recognizing kind of what that is that if
[35:22] God's called someone to to do a
[35:24] particular line of work and that's
[35:25] something they can enjoy and that's
[35:26] something God can bless for them to uh
[35:29] to do good for their family it might
[35:30] require some equipment it might require
[35:32] some schooling it might require some
[35:33] training might require them to live in a
[35:35] particular area and and as long as God
[35:38] they have the provisions to meet that
[35:40] need the needs that come with that
[35:42] vision and that calling then that should
[35:44] be
[35:45] enough does that make
[35:48] sense that should be enough now so now
[35:51] this is where this Edge comes where Paul
[35:54] is saying in order for you to be what
[35:56] God wants you to be
[35:58] there's gain the godliness with
[35:59] contentment is great gain so what we
[36:01] want is godliness and happiness he said
[36:03] well how do I have that well we could
[36:05] get into what godliness is but then
[36:06] there's this contentment with that and
[36:08] he said now that's that's where you want
[36:09] to be so in me being Godlike and in me
[36:13] manifesting his calling in my life
[36:15] whatever that would look like I want to
[36:17] be satisfied in that calling and I want
[36:20] to have some understanding of what the
[36:22] limits are to that so that I'm not
[36:25] always lusting Beyond it right
[36:28] and that I can be much more efficient
[36:30] with what he gives me in that calling so
[36:33] that I can actually bless when it goes
[36:38] beyond right I can give that there's a
[36:41] giving that oh if this happens if I'm
[36:44] going Beyond this Beyond this base I
[36:46] don't need to hoard that or oh my
[36:48] goodness if I can just do this and and
[36:50] God calls you to be the CFO then that's
[36:53] that would be awesome and you're in your
[36:54] position you're in calling next thing
[36:55] you know a CEO opportunity open like
[36:57] I've been with this company forever and
[36:59] it's like this is an opportunity I've
[37:00] waited my whole life for this I'm going
[37:02] to become a CEO but it means I've got to
[37:03] move to New York City and you're like
[37:05] but man this is surely there's a church
[37:06] in New York City a place that big yeah
[37:09] there's got to be one you don't even
[37:10] think to look into it you don't even
[37:11] pray about it you just think this is a
[37:13] natural trajectory and you move into
[37:15] that with this idea that it's going to
[37:18] amplify all the blessings that were in
[37:20] your family when you're on this level
[37:22] and you move beyond the rainment and
[37:26] food you move beyond the godlikeness you
[37:29] move beyond the character you move
[37:30] beyond your calling and your position
[37:31] you move beyond what God wanted you to
[37:33] be into an area where he's like ooh
[37:36] bud there's a lot of diminishing returns
[37:39] once you go
[37:40] there better house better salary you
[37:44] know all better A lot of things but you
[37:46] know what you CH you're whatever you've
[37:48] traded in that exchange you're not going
[37:50] to get the same you're not getting the
[37:52] same return because you haven't made the
[37:54] same investment
[37:58] so Paul is really kicking the door open
[38:00] on something
[38:02] here and he said to be
[38:06] content Desiring no more than what one
[38:11] has Desiring no more than what one has
[38:15] but it speaks of a satisfied there's a
[38:17] peace of mind you're willing to accept
[38:19] what's
[38:20] yours i' like to I would like to present
[38:23] it this way fitting in how I'm trying to
[38:25] paint this picture that God has made
[38:27] promises to you and there's certain
[38:29] things that God wants you to possess and
[38:30] to have and we don't want to live below
[38:32] our Privileges and so if we find
[38:35] ourselves destitute we find ourselves in
[38:37] need and we find ourselves lacking the
[38:38] things that God has promised us then I
[38:40] believe that we should have this Pro
[38:42] this Faith to believe that God has
[38:43] promised provision to be able to provide
[38:45] and God has promised food and God has
[38:47] promised reignment and so it's not that
[38:49] we would just be I've made a lot of bad
[38:51] decisions and I'm a lot of bad debt and
[38:53] this has happened and that's happened
[38:54] and and I put my family in a hole and
[38:56] and and we're living on the street and I
[38:58] guess I just need to be happy a and
[39:00] somehow try to trick ourselves into
[39:01] thinking this is God's will for our life
[39:03] but if you know you're out of God's will
[39:05] then what you should long and desire is
[39:07] to be back in his will and to receive
[39:09] all the blessings that come with being
[39:10] in his will and so to be content is to
[39:13] be happy with what you have and what God
[39:15] has for
[39:16] you this peace of mind this satisfaction
[39:20] let me just do a little bit of a play on
[39:22] words we we are to be content so is it
[39:27] content or
[39:29] content what is it you're looking after
[39:32] what is it that governs godliness with
[39:34] contentment or worldliness with content
[39:37] on content with worldliness however you
[39:40] want to play on the words there content
[39:41] is just information right content is
[39:44] something contained it's items it's
[39:46] material and listen we now have this I
[39:49] want to present it this way God has
[39:51] promised you to be content a
[39:53] contentedness contentment and the world
[39:56] is promising you
[39:58] content the world is promising you
[40:01] stuff and materials and
[40:04] things a and it's a it's an economy it's
[40:07] a rat race and God's promising you to be
[40:11] content we should be seeking contentment
[40:14] not
[40:15] content is this not the age of content
[40:19] production and content consumption yes
[40:23] let me say that content
[40:25] creation you need the alliterations to
[40:27] to flow better content creation and
[40:29] content consumption all
[40:31] se's that's what we Liv right everyone
[40:34] wants to produce content create content
[40:37] content creators right so they can be
[40:43] influencers right this everyone there's
[40:45] a hustle economy where it's like you
[40:47] mean I can just Riff on recipes and kind
[40:50] of put it out there long enough to where
[40:52] the algorithm picks me up and as long as
[40:54] I keep doing this and I create content
[40:57] and people consume it that I can get
[41:00] cash
[41:03] right and in the process
[41:06] credibility and social
[41:08] Karma let's do this everyone try it and
[41:10] this is what I think a lot of our young
[41:12] people wrestle with is a Tik Tok YouTube
[41:14] Creator mindset where it's like we could
[41:17] be the new dude
[41:20] perfect we could be Bros
[41:23] awesome and and we can just all we got
[41:25] to do is trick shots and all we got to
[41:27] do is this and they like there's just
[41:28] going to be some easy segue into doing
[41:30] these things I can put together Legos
[41:33] and do videos of it and we're going to
[41:34] get
[41:35] rich because it's just the age content
[41:38] creation content consumption it's an age
[41:41] of
[41:42] content not
[41:45] content the insatiable appetite for
[41:49] goods insatiable craving for
[41:52] entertainment to be
[41:54] entertained that's why we've gone from
[41:57] we we now have the things that are the
[42:00] most uh addicting are the things that
[42:03] have short Cycles to them things that
[42:06] are most
[42:07] consumable the things that are the most
[42:10] uh uh that you repeat coming back to and
[42:12] you do the Doom scroll with or the
[42:14] things that can just be small bites over
[42:16] and over and over and over and over
[42:18] again there's a craving for
[42:21] pleasure because I eat money uh this
[42:25] avarice that's that's uh it's part of
[42:26] the whole picture
[42:28] and I believe that there is as Paul is
[42:30] saying that having food and reignment
[42:31] let us therewith be content because
[42:32] godliness with contentment is great gain
[42:34] you came into the world with nothing
[42:35] you're going to leave with nothing he's
[42:36] wanting to get us to think on a much
[42:39] more important relevant scale about our
[42:41] lives because there is a pull and a
[42:43] temptation to live to consume to live
[42:47] and consume and acquire beyond what is
[42:52] necessary the I think the the uh the
[42:55] only thing we need to prove that is our
[42:59] cell
[43:01] phones that's it we don't we don't need
[43:04] to dig into anything else like how new
[43:06] the cars are in the parking lot brother
[43:08] BR say they're trading them in all the
[43:09] time and uh some people have owned more
[43:12] cars in their life time than
[43:14] toothbrushes as a matter of fact it is a
[43:16] Bonafide statistic that more people own
[43:18] cell phones than people do
[43:21] toothbrushes and so there are and
[43:24] there's more cell phones than
[43:25] toothbrushes and some of you are really
[43:26] helping them prop up those numbers by
[43:28] not having a toothbrush and multiple
[43:30] cell phones but that's the day and age
[43:32] we live in where we have we're not
[43:35] satisfied and I know there's planned OB
[43:37] opalescence where there's things we buy
[43:39] and it's obsolete because they plan it
[43:41] that way update your phone and
[43:43] immediately it's a brick because they
[43:45] want you to go in and trade it in so I
[43:47] realize there's the the illuminatis
[43:48] behind all of this orchestrating things
[43:51] making these things happen thanks Bill
[43:53] Gates Right trying to get us vaccinated
[43:55] to kill us off and so we we could just
[43:59] cater to that crowd and a lot of people
[44:00] just like are either a lot of people
[44:02] just unsubscribed or maybe a lot of
[44:04] people finally subscribed mash it hit it
[44:06] turn on notifications if you want more
[44:09] of this but there's we take our phones
[44:12] and we trade them in every year no
[44:15] matter
[44:16] what why there's a pool there's a pool
[44:20] to have acquire and consume beyond what
[44:22] is
[44:23] necessary now if your work's going to
[44:25] pay for it if it's necessary to fulfill
[44:28] your vision and your goal then upgrade
[44:30] Cycles are just a fact of
[44:33] life why did it just get quiet all of a
[44:35] sudden I didn't say anything about
[44:37] Starbucks or Dutch
[44:38] Bros I didn't say anything about your
[44:41] rituals I'm just talking about which
[44:44] side are you on Android or
[44:46] iPhone I didn't even bring up
[44:49] names who's still on a Blackberry who's
[44:52] on the Windows phone you're living by
[44:55] what's necessary
[45:00] everyone else is caught up in the rat
[45:01] race a pool to consume beyond what we
[45:04] need I use the example of a cell phone
[45:06] just so you can understand the point I'm
[45:08] trying to make that there's a threshold
[45:10] of what is
[45:11] necessary and then there's this uh
[45:14] pushing beyond
[45:16] that I think we could be prudent with
[45:18] our finances and our purchasing power
[45:20] and the things we buy to where we we buy
[45:22] things that last so it's not just that
[45:25] you're spending oh I can't believe you
[45:27] spent that much money on a pair of shoes
[45:28] well it's going to last 10 times as long
[45:30] as those right so there's some things we
[45:33] put thought into we sacrifice we budget
[45:35] we buy we acquire not because it's it's
[45:38] a status thing but we buy it for life we
[45:40] want to have good things we want things
[45:42] to last it meets a purpose it fulfills a
[45:44] goal if you're a family I don't know why
[45:46] I'm getting into all this stuff but if
[45:47] you're a family that likes to hike and
[45:49] likes to tent and you do it a lot stop
[45:51] buying the cheap tents save and buy a
[45:53] good tent that can last your lifetime
[45:56] same thing for hiking and and and so
[45:58] it's not wrong to have good things and
[45:59] things that last and things that stand
[46:01] up if it meets your family goal and your
[46:03] vision and things that you do that are
[46:04] fulfilling is it making sense and so
[46:08] there's to me there's just a wisdom that
[46:10] the scripture gives us there a wisdom
[46:11] that's coming from the word of God to
[46:13] kind of check us when we're in the flow
[46:16] in the momentum of the world in not in
[46:18] God's path for our
[46:20] lives says this having food and rment
[46:22] let us therewith be content why but they
[46:25] that will be rich fall into temptation
[46:28] and to snare this will be rich it's a
[46:30] craving a longing or pursuing wealth
[46:33] they that will be rich they will to be
[46:35] rich they want to be rich it's a craving
[46:37] a longing to pursue wealth and riches
[46:39] they fall into temptation and a
[46:41] snare it's not even saying some it's
[46:45] saying those who have gain in mind
[46:49] alone they fall into temptation and a
[46:52] snare they fall into the
[46:54] Trap and into many foolish and hurtful
[46:57] lusts read this in a very literal sense
[47:01] that they that are
[47:02] inordinately uh pursuing wealth and
[47:05] status and politics and popularity
[47:07] inordinately creating content or
[47:09] consuming it however you want to look at
[47:11] it they will fall into temptation they
[47:13] will fall into a
[47:15] trap and by those Temptations and those
[47:17] traps many foolish and hurtful lust will
[47:20] be incurred by themselves and their
[47:21] family and it drowns men in destruction
[47:23] and predition this is quite a statement
[47:26] in light of what he's talking about
[47:28] godliness with contentment versus uh
[47:30] wanting more than just what is
[47:33] necessary for the love of money is the
[47:36] root of all evil it's not just money
[47:38] that's the root of all
[47:40] evil but it's the love of it which while
[47:43] some coveted after they covet it after
[47:45] the gain they covered after the riches
[47:46] they cover it after the the the the
[47:48] things they could get the things the
[47:49] stuff the content while they when they
[47:51] coveted it after it as they pursued hard
[47:53] after it they've aired from the faith
[47:56] and Pierce themselves through with many
[48:00] sorrows in our minds we might think oh
[48:02] so that's what happens when someone
[48:04] leaves the message is they get consumed
[48:06] with the Love of Money perhaps for
[48:09] some but it doesn't necessarily say they
[48:12] they they now subscribe to something
[48:14] that's anti- word he's just saying
[48:15] they've aired from the
[48:17] faith they're no longer dealing with
[48:20] Jesus for the to build the kingdom of
[48:23] God for the spiritual production of the
[48:25] Kingdom they've aired from the faith and
[48:28] in airing from the faith it pierces
[48:30] themselves through with many Sorrows
[48:31] those that have the wrong Vision the
[48:33] wrong goal and the wrong Pursuits sign
[48:36] themselves up for hurtful lust foolish
[48:38] lust that drown Us in
[48:41] destruction and that will cause us to
[48:43] air from the faith piercing us through
[48:45] with many
[48:46] Sorrows greed is what causes us to enter
[48:49] into temptation and get trapped the love
[48:53] of money is the root of all evil and
[48:55] just think of the things that spring
[48:57] forth from this
[48:59] roote the love of money is the
[49:01] root of all
[49:04] evil the love of money they well does
[49:08] that mean the almighty dollar does it
[49:09] mean the yin does it mean the Lira what
[49:12] which which what are we talking about
[49:14] Moola cash gidus
[49:17] scratch what is it is it cash app vinmo
[49:21] zel the love of money money now is a
[49:25] phrase that has something to do do with
[49:28] the ability it's power purchasing power
[49:32] something
[49:33] tradable something you can use right
[49:37] there's anything that can be used in the
[49:39] economy to start with a paperclip and
[49:40] end up with a
[49:42] house right anything can be Bartered for
[49:45] in exchange anything that has value even
[49:47] to somebody else that you can give up in
[49:49] exchange as something else the Love of
[49:50] Money speaks of an
[49:52] economy buying selling planting building
[49:56] creating
[49:59] consuming brother brandham says each age
[50:01] had its pressures saying this in thyra
[50:04] for example a great burden of the last
[50:06] age this is Leo DEA is the pressure of
[50:08] riches soft living and nervous tensions
[50:10] it's one
[50:12] burden we cannot Escape it riches soft
[50:16] living and nervous tensions one burden
[50:20] one pressure we're all facing it riches
[50:24] soft living nervous tensions we're all
[50:27] subject to it we all sometimes succumb
[50:29] to it it's why anxiety is on the rise
[50:31] and nerve nervous disorders are on the
[50:33] rise that's why so many uh mental health
[50:35] issues are now more in people's
[50:37] vernacular and they're talking about it
[50:39] and they're and it's more in our
[50:40] conscience than it's ever been before
[50:43] you could probably ask uh uh um some of
[50:46] the oldtimers here like brother Andrew
[50:47] or different ones like did you you guys
[50:49] talk about mental health issues back in
[50:51] your day brother Dale was mental health
[50:53] always an issue all right it wasn't
[50:55] something so sister Darlene yeah it
[50:57] wasn't something was always talked about
[50:58] well you just need so you just need some
[51:00] counseling maybe it's just mental health
[51:02] you just chemistry imbalance it wasn't
[51:04] something we talked about people didn't
[51:05] talk about you know where they talked
[51:06] about it their
[51:09] Diaries that's where they got it out I
[51:11] had a very blue day today feeling very
[51:12] weary not sure why it just seems like a
[51:14] darkness is following me and those words
[51:16] are never spoken from the lips and
[51:19] Housewives and mothers and all sorts of
[51:21] people lived with crippling anxiety and
[51:22] fear and depression and all sorts of
[51:24] mental health issues and now it's more
[51:26] rampant and now it's becoming more
[51:27] talked about why nervous tensions soft
[51:30] living riches what a crazy
[51:36] concoction he says in a complex
[51:39] age that we seem unfitted to live in
[51:43] it's a complex age the pressure which is
[51:46] riches soft living and nervous tensions
[51:48] that we're not fit for so here we are
[51:51] we're not fit for a complex age in these
[51:54] pressures coming down on us
[51:57] the spirit on the age produces a mindset
[51:59] a reaction a kind of a rhythm and
[52:00] influence it influences our perception
[52:02] we think a certain way we perceive
[52:03] things a certain way social norms impact
[52:06] our
[52:07] behaviors the things that are readily
[52:09] accepted and broadly accepted in in the
[52:11] world and in society they impact our
[52:13] behaviors it influences our lifestyles
[52:16] it influences our
[52:18] habits things go
[52:20] viral right and and we do we we we
[52:25] participate in the economy when things
[52:26] go viral we act out certain ways we do
[52:29] certain
[52:33] things this is the snare the snare of
[52:35] Satan's Eden is the vanity of these
[52:37] things The Emptiness of these things
[52:39] it's the spirit of the age to acquire to
[52:41] consume to build up to to store up to
[52:44] have to have and to have brother Bram
[52:45] says in the Le deed Church age now these
[52:47] people had plenty of gold but it was the
[52:48] wrong kind hopefully I'm being able to
[52:51] turn the corner a little bit here uh
[52:54] uh so you could see
[52:59] you can see what's being emphasized they
[53:00] had gold but it was the wrong kind it
[53:02] was the gold that brought men's lives
[53:03] bought men's lives and destroyed them it
[53:06] was the gold that warped and twisted
[53:08] human character for its love was the
[53:09] root of all evil the wrong kind of gold
[53:12] the wrong kind of Commerce the wrong
[53:14] kind of gain twist our character the
[53:16] wrong kind of transactions twist our
[53:18] character the wrong kind of bartering
[53:20] the wrong kind of exchange they had
[53:22] plenty of gain plenty of gold plenty of
[53:24] money but it was the wrong kind it was
[53:26] it the kind that Godlike Christlike
[53:29] character produced in the fiery furnace
[53:31] of Affliction where there's something
[53:32] you're giving but there's something
[53:34] you're getting in
[53:36] return a Christlike character there's
[53:38] plenty of gold there's plenty of cars
[53:40] there's plenty of things there's plenty
[53:41] of
[53:49] stuff talk about
[53:52] stuff I've been recently revisiting a
[53:54] study I had done several years ago go
[53:56] just trying to update the stats and
[53:58] statistics on how many things we have
[54:01] there's more storage units in the United
[54:03] States of America than there are
[54:04] Starbucks and McDonald's
[54:08] combined is that all did I need to open
[54:11] with that to get your attention I'm
[54:13] going to start leading with something
[54:14] like that like you know kind of like the
[54:16] cut in a video where they they get you
[54:18] right up to the door oh I'm in and then
[54:21] they put it at minute 37 right
[54:34] there's so much
[54:35] stuff it's the wrong kind of
[54:39] stuff I'll say this it's not wrong to
[54:41] have stuff but in the absence of the
[54:44] right
[54:46] stuff that's the wrong
[54:50] stuff if you don't have enough of the
[54:52] right stuff all your stuff is the wrong
[54:55] stuff amen this is the stuff we're
[54:57] talking about and I'm not wanting to
[54:59] stuff it down your
[55:00] throats I want you to eat this stuff
[55:02] it's good
[55:04] stuff he says the city of Leia was a
[55:07] wealthy City brother B I'm bringing this
[55:08] out and he's teaching on this it minted
[55:10] gold coins with inscriptions on both
[55:12] sides gold coins characterized the age a
[55:15] flourishing Commerce existed because of
[55:17] it today the two-headed gold coin is
[55:20] with us we buy ourselves out we buy
[55:23] ourselves
[55:24] in we sell out to buy end to this
[55:26] economy a flourishing Commerce existed
[55:29] then Leo de was a wealthy City with
[55:31] their minted gold coins INRI
[55:33] inscriptions on both sides it
[55:34] characterized that age God wanted that
[55:37] characterization that City it's
[55:38] flourishing Commerce it's gold and it's
[55:41] it's Sterling and all those things he
[55:42] wanted it to stand out just as Jesus
[55:45] wanted the planting a and and selling
[55:48] the buying and building and all those
[55:49] things he wanted those things to stand
[55:50] out in the day when the son of man has
[55:52] been revealed today the same flourishing
[55:55] Commerce is with us where we're buying
[55:57] ourselves out and we're buying ourselves
[56:00] in I've run out of time today so I I am
[56:03] just going to go a little bit further
[56:05] and we'll pick up the rest of this we'll
[56:06] have to finish 1 Timothy maybe at
[56:08] another time you won't even well it just
[56:11] depends on how hard you pull on me but I
[56:12] will say this that it may be that I
[56:17] haven't even gotten to what I mean by a
[56:18] mortgage
[56:22] home but in Proverbs 15: 27 it says he
[56:26] that is greedy of gain troubleth his own
[56:30] house but he that hate hateth gifts
[56:33] shall
[56:36] live I love it when the scripture we
[56:38] point this out quite often that you know
[56:40] on its face this is a perfect scripture
[56:43] to get rid of Christmas and birthday
[56:45] celebrations Valentine's Day Mother's
[56:48] Day right are you going to get your Mom
[56:50] a Mother's Day gift well I mean if if
[56:54] she wants to live she should hate those
[56:56] things let's just be scripturally
[56:59] correct I mean do you really want a
[57:03] gift and so we just kind of use that
[57:05] like well the Bible
[57:07] says but that's not what it's saying
[57:11] unfortunately I say that as a family
[57:13] that
[57:15] has Christmas and like four birthdays
[57:18] all within four
[57:21] weeks
[57:24] yes just Eliza and I decided to move out
[57:29] further into the year he that is greedy
[57:32] of gained troubleth his own house but he
[57:34] that hateth gift shall live it speaks of
[57:36] being overly eager to be rich or to have
[57:38] stuff and inordinate affection for
[57:40] things comes back to what Timothy is
[57:42] saying food and rment be happy with it
[57:44] be content for what's necessary to
[57:46] fulfill your vision and your family be
[57:48] content for what is necessary to be the
[57:50] Christian that God's called you to be
[57:52] don't be greedy for gain it's an extreme
[57:53] desire for wealth for material gain I
[57:56] want great gain and Paul's saying
[57:58] godliness with contentment that's great
[58:00] gain but the world says well you can
[58:01] have that but you can also have this too
[58:05] you can have godliness and be happy and
[58:07] all this
[58:08] too greed the Bible is tell us brings
[58:11] ruin and destruction upon a house he
[58:14] that is greedy of gain troubles his
[58:15] house a house does not become a home
[58:18] when gain becomes its
[58:21] emphasis when we are looking to gain and
[58:24] that's the sole purpose why that we have
[58:26] a house over our heads so that we can
[58:28] have a place to sleep so we can have
[58:30] energy to hustle the next
[58:32] day that's not what it is to be greedy
[58:35] of gain troubles the house greedy Being
[58:37] Greedy of gain is what causes a house to
[58:39] not be a
[58:40] home but he that hateth gifts shall live
[58:43] gifts here speak of
[58:46] bribes those things that are given to
[58:49] pervert
[58:51] judgment so he that is greedy of gain
[58:53] troubles his house and in the same
[58:56] notion says he that hates gifts will
[58:58] live he will flourish the trouble will
[59:00] be far from him in other words as a
[59:02] husband and as a wife as a leader in a
[59:04] home I'd say even as a young man and
[59:05] individuals in your own single lives
[59:07] that you are given a a currency and a
[59:10] domain things to look after I would say
[59:12] this that God can provide you all the
[59:14] time and money you need to be what he
[59:16] wants you to be in this life it's just a
[59:18] matter of how you manage the
[59:21] two and so in that there's this uh Being
[59:24] Greedy of gain that's going to bring
[59:26] trouble to your life and he that hateth
[59:28] gifts is going to keep the trouble far
[59:29] from him the gifts are things that are
[59:32] given or things that are offered that'll
[59:34] pervert your daily
[59:37] judgment in other words greed makes us
[59:39] vulnerable to
[59:41] enticements Greed makes us vulnerable to
[59:43] the bait and switch greed is what makes
[59:46] us vulnerable to uh pyramid schemes and
[59:49] Ponzi schemes greed is what makes us
[59:50] vulnerable to really really bad
[59:53] Investments greed is what makes us
[59:55] vulnerable to making to not seeing
[59:57] things for the way that it is the
[1:00:00] opportunity presents itself and I'm not
[1:00:01] just talking about somebody who says
[1:00:03] give me 10 grand and I'll give you 100
[1:00:04] Grand next week and we're like oh my
[1:00:06] goodness this doesn't come by this
[1:00:08] opportunity does not come by very often
[1:00:11] right I'm talking about just in your
[1:00:13] daily transactions and interacting where
[1:00:16] you are not dealing with Jesus for the
[1:00:17] spiritual products of the kingdom of God
[1:00:19] where your transactions are not
[1:00:21] spiritual where there's a gift there's
[1:00:23] an offer that's being offered here take
[1:00:25] this and it it seems free right but
[1:00:29] there's a price there's an
[1:00:31] exchange because it's a gift and that
[1:00:34] you're getting something but they want
[1:00:36] something in return because it's a
[1:00:39] bribe and when we have the wrong kind of
[1:00:42] character the wrong kind of mindset it
[1:00:43] makes us
[1:00:44] vulnerable to these enticements that
[1:00:47] trouble our
[1:00:48] house so Proverbs 1:10 to19 says my son
[1:00:52] if Sinners entice thee consent thou not
[1:00:56] that consent to consent
[1:00:59] not the the the sin is in the yielding
[1:01:02] to the
[1:01:03] enticement not in being enticed the sin
[1:01:06] is yielding to the Temptation not in
[1:01:08] being tempted so he says if Sinners
[1:01:10] entice thee you must be on bad ground
[1:01:13] you must be a bad person no if Sinners
[1:01:15] entice they don't consent because the
[1:01:16] sin is in the consenting if they say
[1:01:18] come with us let us lie we for blood
[1:01:20] scripturally even in the Jews that this
[1:01:22] Blood didn't mean the physical life
[1:01:25] necessarily but it meant money it meant
[1:01:26] gain let us lur privily for the innocent
[1:01:29] without cause let us swallow them up
[1:01:31] alive as the graves and whole as those
[1:01:32] that go down into the pit in other words
[1:01:34] let's take advantage let's get what we
[1:01:36] can let's let's let's scheme we shall
[1:01:39] find all precious substance notice where
[1:01:41] it's all going we shall fill our houses
[1:01:43] with
[1:01:44] spoil let's talk about a mindset and an
[1:01:47] attitude where it's get yours look out
[1:01:48] after yourself this is business I was
[1:01:50] doing business with a brother one time a
[1:01:51] number of years ago a a and and I was
[1:01:53] doing things for him and there was a lot
[1:01:55] that wasen
[1:01:56] a lot of value was being created a lot
[1:01:58] of real work was being done and and I
[1:02:00] got paid a little bit here and paid a
[1:02:01] little bit there in the meantime says
[1:02:02] don't worry business is going so well
[1:02:04] we'll just catch up later and so we just
[1:02:06] kept working and working over a couple
[1:02:07] year period I was eventually owed like
[1:02:09] two
[1:02:11] $250,000 and when I asked him brother
[1:02:14] was worth millions when I asked him
[1:02:15] could I get paid on this he goes do you
[1:02:17] have a
[1:02:19] contract I was like no I I was like you
[1:02:23] know how we've done this from the very
[1:02:24] beginning I did work you paid me we did
[1:02:27] some peacemeal stuff I delayed invoices
[1:02:29] for the purpose of the deal and he goes
[1:02:31] yeah too bad this is a brother in church
[1:02:35] right this is a brother and he's like
[1:02:37] yeah you know you should have known
[1:02:39] better as a lawyer It's Kind like silly
[1:02:42] me are you going to be at communion
[1:02:43] Sunday I'll wash your feet right it was
[1:02:46] almost like the attitude was you should
[1:02:47] have known better but listen there was
[1:02:49] somebody who didn't see the bigger
[1:02:51] picture and you know what maybe I didn't
[1:02:54] either
[1:02:56] maybe I didn't slow down enough and use
[1:02:57] some wisdom like maybe the money's a
[1:02:58] little bit maybe the bills are just too
[1:03:00] easy to to send out maybe I'm racking up
[1:03:03] too much maybe I'm doing too much work
[1:03:05] and not getting paid enough to wear I in
[1:03:07] myself being greedy for the money that
[1:03:09] could be made never slowed down enough
[1:03:11] to say is this wise to do this is it
[1:03:13] even healthy for our the dynamic and the
[1:03:16] relationship as brothers to do this and
[1:03:18] the answer is no it's
[1:03:19] not so yeah maybe I make it sound like
[1:03:22] it's his fault but at the end of the
[1:03:24] day I had my self to
[1:03:29] blame because the whole gain the whole
[1:03:31] idea is to fill our houses with all the
[1:03:33] things we
[1:03:34] acquire our house can be well fitted he
[1:03:38] says cast in thy lot Among Us let us all
[1:03:40] have one purse so he says my son walk
[1:03:43] not thou in the way with them refrain
[1:03:45] thy foot from their path for their feet
[1:03:47] run to evil and make haste to shed blood
[1:03:51] surely in vain the net is spread in the
[1:03:53] sight of any
[1:03:54] bird now this bird
[1:03:58] idea kind of maybe a little bit of a
[1:04:00] play on it but we'll just keep going the
[1:04:02] net is spread in the sight of any
[1:04:04] bird spread in vain when it can see it
[1:04:07] when it knows and they lay weight for
[1:04:09] their own blood they lurk privil for
[1:04:11] their own lives now they're lurking for
[1:04:14] blood they want to consume they want to
[1:04:16] fill their house with spoils but whose
[1:04:18] lives are at stake so are the ways of
[1:04:22] everyone that is greedy of gain he that
[1:04:24] is greedy of gain troubleth his own
[1:04:26] house they that will be rich they that
[1:04:27] are greedy for gain fall into temptation
[1:04:29] and a snare and into foolish traps and
[1:04:31] hurtful lust that drowns them in
[1:04:32] destruction and predition they when they
[1:04:34] covet after this money this gain they
[1:04:36] air from the faith they're pierced
[1:04:37] through with many with many Sorrows Paul
[1:04:40] is using a poetic language to draw from
[1:04:42] these very things of the Proverbs and
[1:04:44] the Old Testament the ways of one that
[1:04:47] is greedy with gain everyone that is
[1:04:49] greedy of gain which taketh away the
[1:04:51] life of the owners
[1:04:53] thereof whether it be the life lives of
[1:04:56] the one they take it from are their very
[1:04:57] own because greed is tantamount to
[1:05:02] murder because you'll either murder
[1:05:04] somebody else to get it but in the
[1:05:07] process you murder yourself you murder
[1:05:08] your
[1:05:12] family I'm going to end this was going
[1:05:14] to be in the middle but I'm going to end
[1:05:15] with Homer's
[1:05:17] Odyssey not Homer
[1:05:20] Simpson Homer's
[1:05:23] Odyssey brother John just go ahead and
[1:05:25] show the picture
[1:05:27] odys is sailing home through the Straits
[1:05:28] of
[1:05:29] Messina after the Trojan
[1:05:33] War and as he's sailing home he has to
[1:05:36] pass through these Straits and these
[1:05:37] islands that are near proximity to those
[1:05:39] that would pass through in this
[1:05:41] mythology Homer is writing this
[1:05:43] mythology and this is the first mention
[1:05:46] of these I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[1:05:49] use the phrase siren song so this is
[1:05:51] where I'm coming from anybody ever heard
[1:05:52] the phrase a siren song yes so these
[1:05:55] Sirens lived on these islands waiting
[1:05:57] for passing ships to come
[1:06:00] by and they would Allure the sailors
[1:06:03] with the Beautiful
[1:06:05] music and so in the Odyssey the sirens
[1:06:09] tried to tempt odyss and his crew to
[1:06:12] come on land in order to kill
[1:06:16] them and so here's you have those now
[1:06:19] this is a beautiful way to think about
[1:06:21] this when we're talking about those that
[1:06:22] are greedy for gain and he says and it
[1:06:25] said when Sinners entice thee consent
[1:06:27] thou not right like they're saying hey
[1:06:30] let's do this let's get and let's gain
[1:06:33] and it's in contrast to the mindset with
[1:06:34] having food and reignment be content
[1:06:36] godliness with great gain uh godl
[1:06:38] contentment is great gain like that
[1:06:40] that's the mindset that's the character
[1:06:42] we're trying to lift up then there's
[1:06:43] this whole other side to it now you
[1:06:45] realize when you're transacting you're
[1:06:47] you're greedy for gain let's just say I
[1:06:49] I realize it I was the one when I was
[1:06:51] doing those deals and get my invoice
[1:06:53] kept getting higher and higher and
[1:06:54] higher and higher and I kept thinking
[1:06:55] man I'm going to get paid I was greedy
[1:06:57] for gain but the thing that I didn't
[1:06:58] realize is the person I was dealing with
[1:07:02] they're greedy for gain
[1:07:03] too right and so you're in that
[1:07:07] economy that if you want to do business
[1:07:10] with them you either need to kill
[1:07:12] them or they're going to kill
[1:07:15] you and the brother Aaron tweet out of
[1:07:19] cond context is is kill them before they
[1:07:21] kill you brother Mitch has come up with
[1:07:24] a uh a twe uh a Twitter account that
[1:07:28] takes my statements out of context he
[1:07:29] says this would go viral could we
[1:07:31] monetize
[1:07:33] it there is it it's in that whole realm
[1:07:36] in this
[1:07:37] economy and so what would happen in this
[1:07:41] uh as these ship men would pass through
[1:07:43] and the crew would hear these songs it
[1:07:45] entices them it allur them these
[1:07:47] beautiful women and they're singing no
[1:07:49] there's something drawing on their flesh
[1:07:50] and they might think oh wow this is
[1:07:53] going to satisfy this is going to please
[1:07:54] but the one singing had something to
[1:07:56] gain in it too and it was to murder
[1:07:58] those men there's a lot of Mythology
[1:08:00] behind it as to whether or not though
[1:08:03] they had they were singing for pany or
[1:08:05] as my wife would say it persone and uh
[1:08:09] that was the name of the store and we
[1:08:12] used always thought was persone until we
[1:08:13] learned Greek
[1:08:16] mythology
[1:08:17] pipany they that there was that they
[1:08:20] these Sirens now in some sort of
[1:08:22] banishment some sort of mode in these on
[1:08:24] these islands they wanted to kill and so
[1:08:27] odsis was warned ahead of time and this
[1:08:29] is the warning the sirens bewitch
[1:08:31] everybody who approaches them there's no
[1:08:35] homecoming for the man who draws near
[1:08:37] them
[1:08:38] unawares so it's talking about
[1:08:40] unawareness there's no homecoming
[1:08:43] there's no home there's no home life
[1:08:44] there's no vision if we try to make our
[1:08:46] way through this world unaware of the
[1:08:49] sirens for with their High clear song
[1:08:52] the sirens bewitch him as they sit there
[1:08:55] in the the meadow piled high with the
[1:08:56] moldering skeletons of men whose
[1:08:59] withered skin still hangs on their
[1:09:01] bones what a picture that's painted
[1:09:04] using the the the gift of words and
[1:09:07] literature to paint the picture of men's
[1:09:10] flesh whose lies has been taken still
[1:09:12] moldering there in the Meadows of these
[1:09:15] islands who have been Bewitched by the
[1:09:17] siren
[1:09:18] song and tricked into coming ashore
[1:09:21] tricked into coming on land with what do
[1:09:24] entic them only to lose Lo their
[1:09:26] lives and so one British lawyer and
[1:09:29] actually a a literary figure in England
[1:09:32] he he he summarized it this way their
[1:09:34] song though irresistibly sweet was no
[1:09:38] less sad than sweet en lapped both body
[1:09:41] and soul in a fatal
[1:09:44] lethargy the Forerunner of death and
[1:09:47] Corruption this is what's happened in
[1:09:49] the day we live in today we're passing
[1:09:52] through Straits and there's sirens on
[1:09:54] every side singing to us calling to us
[1:09:58] trying to tempt us and if we approach
[1:10:01] them unawares it's necessary to approach
[1:10:03] to get
[1:10:05] home it's necessary to live it's
[1:10:07] necessary to work it's necessary to go
[1:10:09] to school it's necessary to interact
[1:10:10] it's of necessity we can't all just sell
[1:10:13] everything we have and move into the
[1:10:14] middle of nowhere in Wyoming we can't
[1:10:16] all do that we could try maybe but it's
[1:10:18] just not going to work right of
[1:10:22] necessity we have to be doing what we're
[1:10:23] doing and I'm glad that you are because
[1:10:25] you know what I believe that there's
[1:10:27] going to be testimonies of people who
[1:10:29] arrive in this congregation who are
[1:10:31] going to say but for you who went to
[1:10:34] work but for you who went to school but
[1:10:36] for you who went to the grocery store
[1:10:38] every day I would have never known
[1:10:40] Christ I would have never come to this
[1:10:42] gospel I would have never known freedom
[1:10:44] I would have never known healing I would
[1:10:45] have never known Deliverance so it's of
[1:10:47] necessity we have to we have to pass
[1:10:50] through but let us not pass through
[1:10:54] unawares there is no homecoming if we
[1:10:56] don't go this way but there is no
[1:11:00] homecoming if we approach
[1:11:03] unaware you want to just bury yourself
[1:11:05] and avoid it you'll never make it to
[1:11:06] Heaven you'll never make it in the
[1:11:08] rapture we got to live our ways into
[1:11:12] that but if we're going to live we've
[1:11:14] got to be aware of the siren song
[1:11:16] irresistibly
[1:11:19] sweet but it laps mind and body into a
[1:11:22] lethargy laziness a stuper which is the
[1:11:25] Forerunner of death and
[1:11:27] Corruption the siren song is an
[1:11:29] enticement that's hard to resist even
[1:11:31] though it leads to
[1:11:34] harm in other words a lot of you know
[1:11:36] right now what the siren songs are in
[1:11:38] your life and the reason why you know
[1:11:39] it's a siren song is because what it
[1:11:41] does to you when you've listened to it
[1:11:45] what it's produced and what it's brought
[1:11:47] and so you know it's irresistible
[1:11:49] despite the destruction it
[1:11:53] brings and the world this this Eden this
[1:11:56] place that we live is constantly singing
[1:11:58] a siren
[1:11:59] song many urements whether it be through
[1:12:02] lust or even the desire to be rich to
[1:12:04] have possessions or experience
[1:12:07] things he that is greedy of gain
[1:12:10] troubles his own
[1:12:13] house in Proverbs 11: 28-29 Brothers if
[1:12:16] you could come to your instruments I'm
[1:12:17] going to wrap this up Proverbs 11: 28-29
[1:12:21] he that trusteth in riches shall
[1:12:23] fall but the right shall flourish as a
[1:12:29] branch he that trusteth in riches shall
[1:12:33] fall but the righteous shall flourish as
[1:12:35] a
[1:12:36] branch he that troubleth his own house
[1:12:39] shall inherit the wind and the fool
[1:12:41] shall be servant to the wise of
[1:12:44] heart the Bible says the rich ruleth
[1:12:46] over the poor and the borrower is
[1:12:48] servant to the
[1:12:51] lender this is what a mortgaged home is
[1:12:57] where we are no longer dealing with
[1:12:59] Christ for the spiritual products of the
[1:13:00] kingdom of God our transactions are no
[1:13:03] longer spiritual and because we've
[1:13:05] continued to transact there's constantly
[1:13:07] been a buying out and a buying in a
[1:13:10] selling and a gaining but there's also
[1:13:12] been a price that's been
[1:13:14] paid and even if you've been able to
[1:13:16] accumulate a lot of stuff if you trust
[1:13:19] in riches you're going to fail if you
[1:13:22] trust in it for happiness if you trust
[1:13:24] in it for the portion if you trust in it
[1:13:25] for possession you're going to fall but
[1:13:28] the righteous shall
[1:13:34] flourish I I had a whole I had I have
[1:13:39] enough to continue to preach for another
[1:13:40] hour and 20 minutes so if you'll just
[1:13:43] give me a second to find where we could
[1:13:45] land where I want to just sum this
[1:13:47] up a mortgaged
[1:13:50] home it's not about borrowing money to
[1:13:52] buy a house
[1:13:55] but it's about burdening the home
[1:13:56] because we lack
[1:13:58] wisdom it's about burdening the home
[1:14:01] because we lack
[1:14:04] wisdom maybe I'll tie these things in
[1:14:07] together Wednesday
[1:14:09] night but spiritual transactions I I'll
[1:14:12] emphasize I had several scriptures to
[1:14:13] use but spiritual
[1:14:15] transactions do not mortgage your home
[1:14:17] they set it
[1:14:20] free spiritual transactions is what
[1:14:22] we're after
[1:14:27] if I could say this I I'll repeat it
[1:14:29] Wednesday
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:32] night I'm not advocating for strong
[1:14:35] robust tools to help us in the moment of
[1:14:38] temptation but John if you want to put
[1:14:40] the uh that picture back
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:50] up there's certain measures of restraint
[1:14:53] that are being taken care of here
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:01] odyusa in their
[1:15:03] ears they did everything they could now
[1:15:06] to try not to hear the siren song and
[1:15:08] these are measures of restraint in the
[1:15:10] moment as they approach they're
[1:15:13] aware but I'm not advocating for tying
[1:15:15] ourselves to the
[1:15:17] Mast I'm not advocating for us to stick
[1:15:20] wax in our ears that would only impair
[1:15:22] our true Duty and purpose
[1:15:25] that that's a that's a in the- moment
[1:15:26] measure to try to exercise some sort of
[1:15:29] self-restraint what I believe the
[1:15:30] scriptures teaching us is yes in the
[1:15:33] moments of Temptation there may be
[1:15:35] things we could do to plug our ears to
[1:15:36] put wax on our ears to tie ourself to a
[1:15:38] MK and there may be some measurement of
[1:15:40] resistance that we need to do in the
[1:15:41] moment of temptation but I'm act I
[1:15:43] actually believe there's a wisdom that
[1:15:45] can come from God where we don't need to
[1:15:47] have strong robust resistance mechanisms
[1:15:49] in the time of temptation but we have a
[1:15:51] wisdom that leads us far from it right
[1:15:54] yes there could be a wisdom that tells
[1:15:56] us you don't have to go through the
[1:15:58] streets of Messina there's a way to get
[1:16:00] there might be a little bit harder a
[1:16:01] little bit longer but I'll get you there
[1:16:02] you'll get home but you don't have to go
[1:16:05] by and tempt yourself to the siren
[1:16:08] song and yet I believe there's a wisdom
[1:16:11] of God that we could have in our hearts
[1:16:12] and an experience that we can lift up in
[1:16:14] our home to if that's the way that we
[1:16:16] have to go I don't need to tie myself to
[1:16:18] a mass I don't need to shove a bunch of
[1:16:20] wax in my children's ears they can have
[1:16:22] the wooing of the sirens they can have
[1:16:25] the singing of the world and they stay
[1:16:27] steady right
[1:16:29] on it's a manner of living that keeps us
[1:16:32] from being distracted from our purpose
[1:16:35] odsis and even orus orus and and Jason
[1:16:39] and the Argonauts I think he wanted to
[1:16:40] play as liar he wanted to play louder
[1:16:42] than the sirens that's wonderful if
[1:16:44] that's what we need to do in the moment
[1:16:45] but how about having the kind of
[1:16:47] character that can just let the world
[1:16:48] sing its
[1:16:50] song and I don't need to use unnecessary
[1:16:53] measures
[1:16:56] what I want
[1:16:58] to leave you
[1:17:01] with is let's have spiritual
[1:17:03] transactions the Bible says in Proverbs
[1:17:05] 23:23 buy the truth and sell it not also
[1:17:08] wisdom instruction and understanding
[1:17:10] remember what builds a
[1:17:12] house it's that last scripture brother
[1:17:14] John what you you you remember what
[1:17:16] establishes it you remember what fills
[1:17:19] it buy the truth and sell it not also
[1:17:23] wisdom and instruction and understand
[1:17:24] standing godliness should be
[1:17:27] valued godliness in a home godlikeness
[1:17:30] should be valued and treasured and
[1:17:31] pursued Christ is the most important
[1:17:35] thing God gives us this remedy for the L
[1:17:37] deing condition he gives us a remedy for
[1:17:39] the siren song he gives us something to
[1:17:41] consider and to think about when the
[1:17:42] sirens are singing and the sirens are
[1:17:44] wooing us and the sirens are calling us
[1:17:46] we're like wow this is irresistible this
[1:17:48] is attraction I I I I want to give into
[1:17:50] it and yeah I know maybe there's a price
[1:17:52] and maybe it won't work out good but
[1:17:54] I've got to try it I got to figure it
[1:17:55] out there's a there's an answer he says
[1:17:57] come to
[1:17:58] me the remedy for the L toan condition
[1:18:01] the remedy for the siren songs is gold
[1:18:03] Raymond and isab to see come to me and
[1:18:06] receive gold and clothing and wisdom
[1:18:09] Christlike character true Holiness and
[1:18:11] spiritual Revelation is what these
[1:18:13] things represent and they're worth every
[1:18:17] effort these are the things that ought
[1:18:19] to have place in our homes this be this
[1:18:20] should be the right stuff Christlike
[1:18:23] character true Holiness spirit
[1:18:24] Revelation those should be the we're
[1:18:26] dealing with Jesus for the spiritual
[1:18:28] products of the kingdom of God in these
[1:18:31] spiritual transactions they Investments
[1:18:33] not
[1:18:34] detriments these are real
[1:18:37] Investments our transactions are not all
[1:18:41] spiritual right let's not try to
[1:18:44] spiritualize getting gas tomorrow
[1:18:45] morning and getting the energy drink and
[1:18:48] the muffin on our way out of Quick Trip
[1:18:50] let's not spiritualize
[1:18:52] that but those are TR transactions on a
[1:18:55] daily basis and interactions on a daily
[1:18:57] basis and the reason why some of us
[1:18:59] succumb to the siren song is there's not
[1:19:02] enough other spiritual transactions to
[1:19:04] keep us
[1:19:06] centered and so even in what should be a
[1:19:08] home and a Haven and a safe place chaos
[1:19:12] and lust Temptation and strife and all
[1:19:15] sorts of things that Paul talks about
[1:19:18] exist because the vision isn't right
[1:19:21] pray for
[1:19:22] wisdom pray for this kind of wisdom and
[1:19:24] pray for the gold the rment and the
[1:19:27] spiritual Revelation pray for those
[1:19:30] things in your life a wealth of those
[1:19:31] spiritual things engage in those kind of
[1:19:34] transactions so that as we make our way
[1:19:36] through the
[1:19:38] Straits we're not tied to a mass wax
[1:19:42] isn't in our ears but we can just row
[1:19:45] right through the Straits together in
[1:19:47] unison knowing we're going
[1:19:50] home we got to make it home God bless
[1:19:53] you you can stand now
