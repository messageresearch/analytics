TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we've been addressing through some of the services how that God's love is misunderstood and we acknowledge that human love is imperfect and having either manifested that human love or experienced that human love on some level we realize that humans love differently and we process love differently and since we have certain attributes we attribute to love and certain feelings we attribute to love and certain ways that we might want love to look it changes things or it hurts things when we look to God and we expect him to love like our parents did or expect them to love like we do because though there can be a lot of positives to that there's also a shortcoming to that because human love is temporal and I want to revisit a familiar theme something that I think we kind of touched on through several Services Through The Years here and then maybe just drill down real deeply on one aspect to kind of help us to know the love of God and not just to know it but to trust it to believe it and uh this is I'll say this now and I'm kind of forecasting what we want to look at on Sunday morning is the connection between the word and perfect love and how those things work together you could even call Charity that perfect love and today kind of looking at the manifestation of love and that's why we're calling it Love's evidence this is the manifestation of love and looking at this will also address uh the evidence of the Holy Ghost and how some believe the evidence may be this and others may think it's something else we already touched on how that perfect love is the baptism of the Holy Ghost well brother bear says whatever you do it takes perfect love to be there whatever you do don't miss it make sure you have perfect love it's not adding a requirement to the requirement already to be sealed with the Holy Ghost that seal is perfect love so we'll kind of be looking at the evidence of that perfect love and this is kind of maybe a thesis statement for tonight but especially for Sunday morning the word is perfect love expressed that that's just the most simple way I think I can put it it's the perfect love is the Divine manifestation of the word of God you don't have the word that's one way and then perfect love another they're they're essentially one and the same and as we look at this Love's evidence tonight I say that there are certain attributes and I might want to do air quotes with that there's certain attributes associated with love that can be impersonated certain things you say well if you love me you would do this or when love does something well love is patient and love is kind and love speaketh no evil love thinketh No Evil And so there's ways that we begin to process what that looks like in human interaction and and how it could be manifested in a relationship and so there's attributes associated with love that either can be impersonated or misinterpreted where love expresses itself and maybe you don't see that as love or Love Is manif Love is Manifest in a way where someone says wow oh that that looks like real perfect love but there's something that makes perfect love what it is and those things can be missed sometimes do you recall I think it might have been even in the first service so I know you have perfect recall and you all know exactly what I'm talking about look we mentioned how that perfect love is not just sacrificial because there's a there's a tendency to think oh well love just sacrifice itself and love is this but love is more than just sacrificial but it's submissive to God's word first so if God's word says to give you give if God's word says not to give you don't give so if you're being called if someone's demanding a sacrifice but the word doesn't demand it then that wouldn't be fulfilling the word of God that wouldn't be love if you went beyond the boundaries of love you went beyond what God's word required you to do you can't make yourself out to be a hero of love in sacrificing yourself if it isn't according to the word of God in John chapter 10 verses 17 and 18 and this just kind of hits this right on the nose as far as perfect love is not just sacrificial but it's submissive to God's word he says therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again so it's a kind of sounds like he's saying that God loves me because I'm willing to die I'm willing to lay down my life but the harmony that existed between the father and the son is the son expresses Christ expresses I know the father loves me and I love the father and whatever he asked me to do I'll do it because that's what love is and love is not asking Christ to do anything that love can't cover love is not demanding something of Christ that love can't give so it's not a it's not an unsafe love he says my father loves me because I laid down my life that I might take it again he says no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself this is a very interesting statement he says I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it against we might say well he had the power to lay down his life he had power to take it up again he says I laid down my life then I might take it up again I have power to do this you're not going to take it away from me I'm going to lay it down and the father loves me and I love him so I'm going to lay down my life and I'm not only going to lay down my life but father's gonna raise it back up again and notice what he says this commandment have I received of my father so his power to lay down his life and his power to raise it back up was connected with the word of God it's connected with God's will it wasn't that just some kind of power that he could exercise whenever he wanted to say hey guys watch this and then raise himself back up but it had to be according to the will of God so when we think of the greater love the greater love hath no man than this that he laid down his life for his friends it's not that like killing yourself or taking your life or sacrificing is the greater love but the Greater Love was not just a sacrifice but it was an obedience to God's word it says in first Samuel 15 22 maybe we're missing something by not looking at the context but Samuel said to Saul hath the Lord great Lord as great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams and that touches on some particular things that maybe some people are sensitive to because they think oh well I just want to pour my love out on Christ and I just want to Lavish him with my praise and they think that through worship and praise and manifestation of gifts and crying and Sorrowing and all sorts of bodily exercise that that is that is a greater worship to God that's a greater affection to God or that demonstrates a greater love but obeying God's voice demonstrates a greater love it's not just sacrificing when Christ laid down his life it wasn't just saying what's the greatest love what's the greatest love I think if you gave your life that would be the greatest love it was this is what God has asked me to do asked him to do the ultimate to lay down his life but it wasn't without that promise that I'll take it back up again but it was according to the Commandment that he received from his father and to obey was better than sacrifice I mean obviously hypothetically if that's not what God wanted him to do he couldn't find a greater love by doing something that wasn't according to the word of God it was according to God's commandment and so obeying the voice of the Lord because obeying is better than sacrifice and to hearken is better than the fat of ram so we have to be careful not to think that certain things will Express a greater love to God if we're not obeying God and Christ as he was will he says the father loves me and I'll lay down my life we could say that Christ was the manifestation of perfect love yeah he was perfect love revealed he was the heart of the father demonstrated he was the perfect word of God the perfect love of God expressed now I want to read I'm going to re refer back to some things we read on Sunday but I want to read this statement from Christ as the mystery of God revealed and I want you to think about the the seventh seal implication and that's not a title but it might make a good one but when we think about what God has done in this last day when we think about what he's preaching here and we think about the word of God opening up just think about what this means for the elect he says Christ has Mercy the law put you in jail but couldn't get you out now chew on this one the prophet is is God's justice to condemn you and kill you for it that's right but Jesus was God's love and Revelation to let know to a predestinated seed that he had called you so Jesus is God's love and Revelation to the predestinated seed that's what he is Christ is is God's love and Revelation to the predestinated seed Jesus Christ Brothers said is the love of God Jesus Christ is God's heart so when we see the revelation of Jesus Christ it's revealing something and opening up something not just a historical lesson but it's revealing God's love and Revelation to the predestinated seed as brother Graham says on the first seal I used to think that God was angry at me but Christ loved me but he says Christ is the very Heart Of God so that doesn't mean Christ is angry too it means that God's not angry because if Christ loves and he demonstrated love that was the love of the father expressed so Christ isn't the mercy seed and that he's standing between you and an Angry God that set on destroying you but God's justice demanded a penalty for sin God wants that to be satisfied so his son stands for the perpetuation representing the heart of God and the desire of God to redeem you and so Christ was in the very manifestation of God when he laid down his life now that might be a manifestation that we could all get on board with to say now there's no greater love than that when Christ laid down his life and so Christ is the heart of God and Christ is the revelation of God's love to the predestinated seed that we would know our election and we'd be secure in his love that Christ is the manifestation of perfect love and it's the same Christ that begins to act in John chapter 2. and I guess you could say well it seems pretty early on in his ministry so maybe he was just getting used to it but in John chapter 2 verses 15 to 17 is we'll read these three verses it says and when Jesus so he'd come down to Jerusalem and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen so he had taken these cords and it says a scourge of small chords so in other words he's made himself a whip he's made himself an instrument that he's going to use to drive out the animals and he's going to cause all of them to run out and think of the chaos that he's now causing this is something that had been entrenched this is tradition it was very very robust and a practice that was fully they're fully engaged and had accepted and so not only did he drive the animals out by maybe beating them and whipping them with the small cords but then he goes to the changer's money he says and he poured out the changes money and overthrew the tables now just if you can in your mind not for very long just imagine that and kind of allow your mind imagination to wonder and picture what this scene looks like when Jesus shows up braids a whip and starts running off all the animals and then as he's done running the animals out he goes over to the money changers and he dumps their money out then he goes to the table and flips the tables over and we all go oh what a temper fit right this is I can't believe he's doing this who is this guy we need to tell his mom Mary get over here and so here he is throwing these things out and he said unto them that sold doves I don't know why he picked on the dove sellers but it says take these things hence maybe because he couldn't whip him and get him out of there he needed to run off at the cages he says make not my father's house and House of merchandise and when he has done this when he has come and he has made a whip and run off all the uh the sheep and The Oxen and told the the dove Keepers to run off with them and overthrew the tables and poured out the money he says don't make my father's house a den of Thieves and it says in verse 17 the disciples remembered that it was written this is in Psalm 69 9 the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up so what was Jesus doing he was manifesting prophecy David had already prophesied that Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up this Zeal would have been a terminology that was very familiar with even that sect of the zealots that believed in in radical uh defense of the law and and even putting people to death and here Christ is not just impatient he's not petulant he's not going in there said this is my father's house I need to take back control and it's not a temper fit might look like one it wasn't wrath it wasn't anger in a humanistic sense but it says the Zeal of thine house the prophecy had overcome them the purity of the word of God the very thing that he was called to do he begins to act in this and so this was perfect love being manifested everybody starts saying Hey Google buy me a scourge of small courts but this is perfect love this is a Zeal according to knowledge this is loyalty only to God's word now and I think there's a lot that we could dwell on this and maybe take it from different angles but in the the sermon earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Brothers says do you believe Jesus had compassion he said he was full of love now I'm going to come back to uh this scene in John chapter two but now brother bear was talking about him uh how how much you know maybe at the pool of Bethesda how there's all these sick people and Jesus just walked right by all they're sitting because we say well love would heal that one love would heal that one this is what love would do right when we say that we're saying our love would our loved one when someone would come up for prayer or be have a demon on him we'd say oh just cast it out and just pray that they're well and and that would be our empathy that would be our very least our sympathy that would be our human emotions and and oh my goodness this is this is horrible let's pray let's pray but perfect love would say wait a minute that's there for a reason or this is why it's there and if you'll just do this that'll leave and what we might do even be enthused is want to pray for someone to cast a demon off God put it there for a reason and what might just have to come right back because God that's perfect love that sometimes allows things to happen in order to get his children where he wants them to be so he says do you believe Jesus had compassion and that word compassion the Old Testament is love he says he was full of love but it's just like the people sometimes in love they forget what kind of love they are talking about the feel your love and the agape love now I think this is the convenience of using those two to divide between God's love and human love he says both of them are love but one's love above and the other is love here on Earth and as I was talking to a reporter today I said the love down here the human love would make you shoot a man on account of your wife but the love that comes from above would make you pray for his lost soul and we could all say Amen I think you're right this is exactly a good description of what human love will do human level drive people to start wars and to kill and to do all sorts of things in the name of infatuation and dependency and they call it love and this is love and I would swim in Ocean and I would do this and I would do that and this is all the things that what man would do for Love's sake and and brother I'm saying here love the human love would cause a man to murder he says but perfect love would intervene and pray for the man's soul he says quite different one of them is a love down here on this level human love and that's the that's the dichotomy I think that we should be looking at human love versus God's love he says and the other is the love that comes from above and in compassions that looks out upon the crowd and say oh won't you heal this person and he's sick and he's in such need this is the good man we know him heal this little baby look that's human compassion but real he says here it is real Divine compassion is to do the will of him that sent you so this is divine love divine love is to do God's will plain and simple Divine love is to do God's will maybe we'll pick up on it on Sunday Lord willing on how that certain things are the fulfilling of the law and you realize to do God's will does not uh is necessarily going to cause you to act in a way to you're not hating you're not murdering right you're going to be operating in in a way that is best for mankind even though it might hurt and even though it might rebuke sin uh you're operating according to the will of God and it keeps us from doing a lot of the hurtful things we do as humans and if we're offering the word of God when God's word hurts it's so that it can heal it's so that it can hold man accountable so it's just God has a different way of loving than we do but the man says Agape speaking about Allah agape love he says but love is to do the will of him that sends you so this Higher Love This Agape Love This Love that is higher than human love is and I don't mean to be too strict and put a period on it uh to run the risk of trying to shove everything down in this narrow view uh and I don't like to do that in general I find sometimes when I'm listening to the word of God and it's being preached sometimes you feel that maybe uh it's been put in such a way to where that's the only way you have to see it and this and if you're not seeing it that way maybe you're seeing it wrong and so I'm not I'm not I'll even put it this way God's word is so great that I can't explain it so all I'm doing is describing it okay so as I describe it you might think well that's a real narrow application all right I'm just describing this part and so it could I feel that what you can say about this in just a very simple way is divine love is to do God's will that's it a perfect love is doing God's will so now brother Brandon when he treats John Chapter 2 and he does it in a few places to to in great depth in and the sermon Paradox at a businessman's breakfast he's making these statements just before we read this one he's saying Look what Jesus of Nazareth did the other day what'd he ever do for the Fruit of the Spirit brother man describes the fruits of the fruits of the spirit and then what Jesus did he goes not much fruit of the spirit there is there this is this is him saying this is what the critic says about him taking a scourge of small cords driving out the sheep in the ox and pouring over the changer's money flipping over the tables and telling the keepers of the dove delete those that sell dust to leave I say it doesn't look like these are much of the fruits of the spirit so now he makes the statement what is the fruit of the spirit the manifestation of the promised word I think this in some ways that might kind of come as a little bit of a a an interrupter you know some kind of counter statement but if you think about it like of course God's spirit is his word the fruit of the spirit is going to be a manifestation of the promised word I mean it has to be that that makes a lot of spiritual sense to us he says they said if they had just have stopped to look he did not have these things that they had fruit of the spirit or anything and in other words he's saying the kind old priest and he starts describing he's making the comparison the kind old priest you know dedicates the baby goes to the home when your mother dies and he acts in a way that's kind and sensitive and and engaging and then you come over here and you see Christ when he shows up at the temple he's driving out the animals he's flipping over the tables he's scattering money everywhere and he's saying if we took the kind old priest and compared it to Christ in this instance we humanistically would say that's the Fruit of the Spirit but in reality the word is being manifested and that was the fruit of the spirit so when he says um that they did he did not have he did not have the fruit of the spirit he's talking about the human side that we look at but the real reality is the fruit of the spirit is the manifestation of the word he said but the word that was promised that day was manifesting itself that was exactly the light of the hour that was it no matter how much education and how much you speak with tongues how much kind gentle in everything you are because the word is not against being kind it's not against being gentle it's not against speaking in tongues it says unless you accept that word of the hour when it's manifested before you you're in the same predicament the same predicament as the kind old priest the same predicament of the people when they witnessed the what they called the wrath of the anger of Jesus of Nazareth and they said you know what we'll just stick with our priest at least they're nice about this and they at least let us make a living and they let us do these things and they weren't mean to those that sold doves and they might just have this whole Paradigm that thing I would rather like this guy because of this than this guy because he seems very angry he says but they did not accept the word of the hour when it was manifested before them and he says if you do that today you're in the same predicament they were in then now Galatians chapter 5 verses 22 and 23 it tells us what the fruit of the spirits are and then I think it is important to note that it says the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness temperance if I could say this just maybe stir some thought the fruit of the spirit is and it describes these many different things does it suggest then if you don't have them all you don't have the fruit time for a breakout session he says against such there is no law in other words there's no prescription against these things to do these things is not to manifest anything contrary to the word of God there's no brother brother bam when he says doesn't matter how kind gentle in everything you are and how much joy or peace or long-suffering or gentleness and goodness you have and meekness and Temperance if you have that your evil is saying no but if you reject the word this can't be what you're claiming it to be because the spirit can't reject the word so in the same sermon on the paradox and the business is breakfast he says what is the fruit of the spirit he goes love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness fruit of the spirit many people rely on that sometimes that's the devil I didn't know this one got snuck in there sometimes that's the devil he can impersonate that to the letter this is this stops you in your tracks and we all go wait a minute brother Aaron is that a typo is that 64 to 64 come after 63 are we counting this or does it count down or up and we start having this conundrum right and we realize remember that what year did he say it the year in which he was a prophet and give give some weight to it and he says that sometimes the devil he can impersonate that to the letter letter so the the fruit of the spirit these love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness brother Batman saying the meekness and Temperance is that and I and I want to be very I want to be very careful on how I describe this because I'm wanting to uh I want to say what brother Branham said and I want to be faithful the way he said it having read the different places he says it and having several more statements to read to you here I believe that what he says will will help Focus what I'm about to say that there's ways that this can be manifested that to us oh that's Joy oh that's peace oh that's long-suffering that's being meat that's being what a nice sweet person and oh my that's so kind and that's so loving and you say oh that has to be the Lord that that has to be the fruit of the spirit brother bear said not you can't hold that as an Evidence because the devil can impersonate that he says he can impersonate speaking in tongues to the letter interpretation of it to the letter any of those gifts he can impersonate so these when the fruit of the spirit becomes fruits when you divide it up they can be impersonated so these fruits can be duplicated apart from the actual spirit being the nature behind it it can actually be the fruits can be divided from the nature of the spirit so now it's not the fruit now it's fruits and each one of those can be duplicated or manifested apart from the nature and and they're not in their pure form brother Branham and the sermon lamb and Dove okay good this is 1957. he says and the Holy Spirit falls into a meeting and sometimes the believer and the unbeliever worship by The Same Spirit but the fruit of the spirit proves what you are not the reaction of the spirit not to speak with tongues not to shout that goes with it too that all goes with it amen says but unless the fruit of the spirit Bears record with God's word your ju you just got an outward demonstration this I I actually went and and found this statement just felt impressed to put it in here just to use this kind of as those those guidelines for us to recognize that uh even if it stands to hopefully kind of buffer the things I'm trying to say to recognize that brother Branham is dividing between the true fruit of the spirit and those that are we recognize as being fruits of the spirit that can be impersonated he said but unless thee for the spirit Bears record with the word of God you've just got an outward demonstration so you don't have you don't possess the fruit of the spirit which manifests joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance but you have outward demonstrations of joy peace long-suffering generous goodness Faith meekness temperance so it's something that looks it looks like the fruit but the seed will determine what it is right it might look like the same but the life determines whether or not it is so he says and today we're relying so much on outward emotions and demonstrations when it takes a genuine pure Born Again Holy Ghost LED life to prove what you are amen he said now that's right my dear brother and sister unless there is fruit and the fruit of the spirit is not outward demonstrations it's an inward work of Grace love joy peace long-suffering goodness Faith meekness gentleness patience there you are so when we look at it that way when brother Brown describes it that way we're able to look at things that might be a outward human expression but it might in this outward human expression it might seem kind it might seem good it might seem Meek or gentle and all those things and say it might seem that way but he's saying that the real work of God is when you possess that inwardly by the holy spirit it's an inward work of Grace it's not it's not just doing these things and trying to have the fruits of the spirit and in demonstrating Grace and demonstrating joy and demonstrating long-suffering but it's it's having that inward work of Grace that's the true fruit of the spirit and if I could say this and I think this will kind of help in this teaching that these our human manifestations of these things they might not actually be promoting God's perfect will it might be sympathy it might be your own uh your own complexes it might be something that is just saying oh well I think the nice thing to do in this instance would be and it's not really perfect love operating through you it's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the spirit manifesting perfect love but it's that Tainted Love that's driven by other factors your own Pride you know if I did this for them then that would look like I'm living for others right and and well I want to do this because I want to I've read the book How to Win Friends and Influence People and and you're doing things kind of more uh more calculated and contrived and you're doing it as well I've been reading enough human behavior books where I know this is what you ought to do and I've been reading enough about the message to know this is what you ought to do if it that those things could be trying to do God of service without it being his will and it just sounds right and this looks good and all the Optics are yeah hey man the Lord's with you go for it that sounds good yeah I mean everything seems right but in in it the mode of an objective is not submitted to God's word or even in performing it you're not fulfilling God's will that cannot be the spirit so brother Branham in the sermon going beyond the camp I think it's a much larger statement you could come to this to read but he's talking about tongues and Sensations and experience he says and do you know all those things can be impersonated by the devil there's just one thing he cannot impersonate that's the word now this is me now perceiving this I feel like this is going to be a real hard you know jerk in the steering wheel that takes the exit now but this is if Divine love is the manifestation of God's word and the fruit of the spirit can be impersonated and he says oh the spirit the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace and longsuffering and some of these very characteristics describe charity say oh well if these things can be man interpreted where does that put us he said well there's just one thing that cannot be in person and we know this is not the only place he says it he says that's the word now this is where it's I love doing the teaching on Wednesday night I feel this might be the reason why God just uh kind of course corrected me to say this now I know that you all have a rich knowledge in the things of the message brother Branham says in a number of different places the evidence the Holy Ghost is perfect love before 1963 right it says the greatest evidence I know of the greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost uh that I know of is when you can love one another so this is these are statements that brother Branham had things that he said even when we talked about that angel said this is what you preach perfect love is and so brother Branham had this he taught this the evidence of the Holy Ghost is perfect love couldn't think of a greater evidence than when you love one another he's like yeah that makes sense now in the sermon broken cisterns broken cisterns not sisters broken cisterns God we have Brethren and cistern but what would you think would be another she's talking about with brotherly Ville what would you think to be on evidence and I said the most perfect evidence I can think of is love and so we got to talking on that and then I thought that sounded pretty good so I just held that if a man has got love but one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out now now I I'm not going to try to just the cabbage down on the language he's using but he says he straightened him out so it's kind of it's smoothing something out making something plainer and he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word so when we look at it from the love down here I would say he was absolutely wrong he said well the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you could just love one another and get along with one another and I say absolutely wrong he he needed to be straightened out because he says it's not it's neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word so in one sense if you're saying oh well the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when we can just be kind to each other we can manifest attributes of love he said the Holy Spirit straightens them out because in that way I I want to say that the Holy Spirit straightened him out it's not love so we say well it sounds like he's wrong and this is where please help me preach tonight and and you you just help me to say just exactly in a way that's pleasing to the Lord but and God help me to say it I want to say he wasn't totally wrong because he's saying that they the Lord straightened me out so it maybe wasn't that he was going in the wrong direction but the Lord just kind of narrows it down a little bit says you're looking in the right way but you need to focus this a little bit more because the evidence of the spirit is those who can receive the word so the truth was laying there but not in a humanistic love but in the love from above because the love perfect love is the word perfect love is to do the will of God that's what perfect love is so when he takes this if I could say this way the way that it has struck me so I'm just sharing this as it strikes me and I just thank God that I have the Liberty to do it and God will deal with your heart but it's as if he sees something in love and he's drawn to it he sees something uh that there's something pure about love and there's something about the love of God and there's something about the nature of God but he then he realizes but there's certain traits or attributes it's not the fruit of the spirit necessarily it can be impersonated but it's the fruits won't we chop them up and divide them from the life that any of one of those can be manifested in a way that's an impersonation but he's looking at this says oh a human love it can be love can be humanized any one of these traits can be humanized maybe we'll take time to look at how each one of these traits not only has maybe an insincere impersonation from a humanistic standpoint but it's got a humanistic opposite right whether behave or jealousy or those different things but he sees something in love but love the this love or this evidence couldn't be these traits that could be impersonated and so if we say that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is perfect love then that sounds more that sounds better right he says well the evidence of the Holy Ghost is who can one who could receive the word and I say the evidence of the Holy Ghost is perfect love manifesting itself through you then you realize well this is how when brother bam says the evidence the Holy Ghost is love and he says no I need to straighten you out the Holy Ghost and I and I realize now Sunday morning hopefully we'll add a lot more body to this that Holy Ghost the evidence when you can receive the word when you could say a man to the word when you can demonstrate the word when you can live the word and you're only going to do that by love for the word and so brother Brandon it's not that he's completely way out in left field and when the Holy Spirit comes and straightens them out it's not that he can it's a complete shift to where there was nothing to it but it's as if the Lord turned it over and now describes it in a way that gets rid of the confusion of impersonating this and impersonating that it says the real heart of the matter is when you do God's will in the sermon question and answer is part two and that wonderful summer of 64. he's talking about dancing and emotion he said that's no evidence of the Holy Ghost you can't rely on that you can't rely on the fruit of the spirit because the first fruit of the spirit is love and the Christian Science exercise more love than anybody I know of and they even deny Jesus Christ being divine he said there's only one evidence the holy spirit that I know of and that's a genuine faith and the promised word of the hour and you can't have faith unless you have love so he's saying there's only one evidence in the holy spirit that I know of and that is a genuine faith and the promised word of God this is a love not just to one another but a love to God first you can have fruits of the spirit but not have the spirit you can have those humanistic impersonations but we know the spirit itself the spirit itself cannot be embodied falsely or the spirit itself cannot be impersonated that you you're able to replicate its actual life you're able to replicate its true nature you can only mimic the attributes and the traits you cannot I guess the way I'd want to say is you can't impersonate the spirit you can only imagine you can only impersonate the manifestation or the gifts and and as a matter of fact you can impersonate uh you can impersonate something you don't have but if you have it you just demonstrate it there's a difference between the impersonation of what you see and that's what makes a good impersonation is people just you hyper focus on a certain inflection or certain characteristic and all you have to do is just emphasize what you see and what you hear and you can get you can impersonate something but if you have the life you just demonstrated in the sermon what shall we do brother Ben said the evidence as I said the other day we tried to place evidence Luther said believe and walked out the devil believes to Wesley said shout and you got it but he found out he didn't Pentecost said speak in tongues and you got it they didn't Christian Science says love you got the fruit of the spirit but they haven't they denied the Divinity of Jesus Christ what is the evidence of it when that Spirit that's in you can punctuate every promise with an amen and God will confirm it amen that's exactly the way it was with Jesus Christ that kind of brings us almost back full circle as we get some closing here oh yes they had more fruits of the spirit they had all kinds of evidences you can't pin any evidence down to anything but God himself manifesting his word that's it that's the only evidence there is is God manifesting his word that's the only true evidence that there is is that you're a Christian how can you be a Christian when in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God how else can you be a Christian unless it comes back to the the core of everything the root of everything Christ who is the word oh if you love you've got the fruit of the spirit you speak in tongues you got the fruit of the spirit if you just believe you got for the spirit shout you got the holy the for the spirit but he's saying that when the spirit that's in you the spirit says amen when these Spirit that's in you can punctuate every promise with an amen and God will confirm it that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost the evidence of Holy Ghost is when you could receive the word not some system but have a clear understanding he says in the church age book that that's the evidence of those who have the Holy Ghost could receive the word for their age that's that's what you're looking at to know whether or not you have the Holy Spirit is that you could say Amen to the word of God you can receive the word of God and and not just in receiving it but in receiving it welcoming and receiving the word you become the word so the real truth of whether or not you received it is when that word lives for you that's why I can say perfect love the evidence of the Holy Ghost is perfect love living itself through you amen the word made flesh in you you can't pin the evidence on anything down other than God manifest in his word now let's just be honest that's a real safe way of saying it isn't it because we haven't gone to any links to Define what that word is we haven't tried to go to any links to say what that might look like except maybe we've preached on how does love look but what I think it does I'm hoping and what I wanted to accomplish in this is to point to the impersonations point to the false point to the carnal impersonations the humanistic experiences and all these ways that love or the spirit can be manifested in just being kind and being sweet and being accommodating and being inclusive and the whole attitude that people might have on that way and say well there's just a certain way you want to be sensitive and you don't want to offend and and it tries to force an image of love that when it works against they say oh that can't be God because God is love that can't be God but you have to look at what does the word say the word's not asking you to by force injure your neighbor but the word might ask you to do something that makes a stand that your neighbor might not like and that's more love than it would be to compromise can you just a ponder that for the next few days that we might there's ways that human love tries to manifest itself and one sure measuring stick of whether or not you're loving your children whether or not you're loving your spouse whether or not you're loving one another is in doing this do I compromise myself or do I make it easier for them to compromise and if so ask yourself is that really perfect love when I make it easier for someone to compromise the word of God when myself I'm compromising the word of God how can that be perfect love when the evidence of the Holy Ghost which is perfect love is God manifesting his word and our final statement here we'll go ahead and invite the musicians to come just trying to break some record by calling them up this early and the sermon souls in prison now brother Adams he's hearkening back to how people say oh Hallelujah bless God there were so many people that got saved last night and said oh they did and they said they danced in the spirit they spoke in tongues Barbara says that don't mean one thing and then he begins to identify a nature that someone might have oh they're Meek and gentle and humble he says yes sir they got the fruit of the spirit he said that's no sign not a bit he says and we'll get there just a moment he says let me give you the fruit of the spirit between Jesus and the Pharisees see which one had the Fruit of the Spirit and he's specifically referring to Christ braiding a rope driving out the oxen and the Sheep telling the dove lovers to leave tell flipping over the tables scattering money everywhere and saying you've made my God's house a den of Thieves and the Bible says that this is Brother Where I'm saying that they said oh there's no fruit of the spirit there's no fruit of the spirit there brother bam says not by the fruit of the spirit Christian Science can outsmother interview on that and deny even Jesus Christ was defined Divine not that now can we recognize the um I don't want to say tightrope but just how uh the language he's using you really need to catch the thought because he's not saying if the it's the fruit of the spirit as an evidence that you have the life because what's the what's the evidence that a tree is an apple tree [Music] when it Bears apples so he's looking at it and not saying that they're somehow uh they have the light they have a fabricated Spirit he's just saying there are certain things that can manifest outwardly that to human perception this looks like the genuine article they must have the Holy Spirit what was that brother Branham realized when he tells us he teaches that incredible sermon on anointed ones at the end time genuine anointing false seed so it may be the genuine Spirit that's manifesting something but it's no proof of the possession of it maybe the genuine spirit that can manifest itself in these gifts and these operations it can also be in person anybody's saying that's no Vindication because you have to bring it back to the word because the Holy Spirit cannot deny the word so when he's talking about the fruit of the spirit he says this is in its truth and it's Purity but it's the word living there it is if they'd only looked he was a messiah he was the Living Word made manifest well it's the very love and revelation of God to the predestinated series The Very heart of God says in a man that's got the spirit in him or a woman lives that word lives right out in them and then I love this phrase that's the heartbeat the predestinated if I could phrase it this way that's the heartbeat of the predestinated heartbeat why because this is the love this is the true love affair for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word they are the word to the people written Epistles read of all men is that right and I left this one in there because this is the real to me the real uh nail in it could the third pool be on because the words got to be expressed some way the open of the word the open of these seals the revelation of Jesus Christ the very Heart Of God it's got to be made manifest somehow how is it going to happen is it going to be us trying to impersonate the attributes or traits of Love or traits of the spirit are we going to be possessed by the revelation of Jesus Christ when that which is perfect has come now here we are under the headship of the Capstone he is governing the bride from that vantage point and we realize that it's not just me having a love for my neighbors not just me demonstrating kindness but it's me standing true to the word of God it's me upholding the word of God it's me manifesting the word of God and say oh God don't give me a judgmental Spirit Lord don't make me critical don't make me harsh Lord but don't make me compromising don't make me soft I don't want to be inclusive for inclusives and his sake I don't want to be accommodating for a commenting say the Lord I want your word to be made manifest in me because that's my heartbeat and then I become a written epistle red of all men how are all men going to read it when love lives in a human in a human way or through a human when perfect love is manifested in flesh that's how they can read it and says red of all men this love this this word has to be translated to Faith in The Believer we need to live it out but carry this in your hearts as I as I close this tonight to love God is to do his will that loves evidence is keeping God's word I prove my love to him we'll pick up on this Sunday morning I prove my love to him by doing what he says and love is manifested to others when I do my part to be that written epistle not what I think love is not what I think it should look like not what I'm feeling in the moment oh man I really feel sorry for him and I I and maybe I need to do this when the word of God says stay true to the word stay true to the word that's the heartbeat that's the predestiness that you are the heartbeat of the word because the word Lord comes to you and then you become the word to the people a written epistle could the third pull be on I think we have a resounding amen resounding amen by the life that we live the third pool is on because it's proven itself in the life that I live before the people I want to be I want to be the love of God I don't want to be an impersonation of it I want to be it the best thing I can do for my my spouse the best thing I can do for my children the best thing I can do for my brothers and sisters the best thing I could do is live the word of God and not compromise the word of God so many pressures these days they're so there's the threat of political uh violence there's the threat of being canceled there's a threat of going viral there's all sorts of threats but listen I believe that we're safe in God's Pavilion when we fulfill his word it's the people who've taken love and made it something it's not they've taken Zeal and made it something it's not that's when you run the danger of being out on a limb but if you could stay within the confines of God's word he'll fight your battles doesn't mean you won't hurt don't mean it doesn't mean you won't suffer it doesn't mean you won't lose friends doesn't mean you won't offend but your safety isn't keeping God's word loves evidence brother Branham said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is love he was looking at something and the Holy Spirit said love is to do the will of God right love is to do the will of God so the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word and God confirm it that's Love's evidence I hope it's helpful tonight could you stand with me
