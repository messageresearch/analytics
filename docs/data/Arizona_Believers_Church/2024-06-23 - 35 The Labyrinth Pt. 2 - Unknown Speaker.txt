TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is part two of The Labyrinth and if you have any questions about where we're drawing this from you could go back uh to Wednesday night's service and we gave a lot of background to the concept of the labyrinth we are drawing it from uh the reference that brother Brandon makes and um the source of that when he refers to the labyrinth in the church age book which in the kind of the source and the mythology that it was brought from is this lath was a confusing structure it was made intentionally to be confusing and in the mythology it was cunningly made it was made to deceive and it was made in such a way that once one was in it they would be caused to wander around and ultimately it would be punishment on death for one to be cast into this Labyrinth so it was a prison a prison house and it was intentionally meant to be confusing and so we're using this concept of the labyrinth as brother brandham did and so if you have some things that you want more background on or you try to wonder wondering where it came from feel free to ask me questions but Wednesday night service covered it quite a bit especially the source material that brother brandham used and we're taking it from chapter 7 of the church age book where brother brandham beginning in page 254 at that last paragraph he refers to John uh cominius and the one thing needful as he says it or Unum necessarium was published in 1668 right at the end of comenius his life and so we're going to that's where we we're drawing it from and studying from and so this is the larger statement that brother Brandon makes and this is really where I'm beginning I'm drawing so much from this paragraph here that I'd like just to expand and then come right back to this place of the church age book and So speaking of the sardy and age he said if there ever was a a time of denominational Zeal it was at this tragic time when he says denominational Zeal he's not just referring to one denomination but the the multiple denominations and thoughts that would have existed and how each one uh had a great Zeal and he calls it a tragic time the words of commius describe much of this era cominius wrote the one thing needful and so this would be a writing which has given us great insight into the thought at the time he compares the world to the Labyrinth and when he says the Labyrinth it's referring specifically to that one in the Greek mythology that minus the king had made to cast that Minotaur into uh for that punishment he compares the world to the Labyrinth and shows that the way out is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful Christ so when he says that one uh one thing needful and then it says he compares the world to the Labyrinth and shows the way out is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful Christ the needless versus the necessary the needless versus the needful the unnecessary that's quite a statement when you think about uh all the things in our lives that are really unnecessary and there there's reading a book about um someone who did a hike through in the Grand Canyon and one of the experts at the time or very knowledgeable told these these guys were going to sat on this uh complete hike through said this is what you're going to find out are you're going to find out the things you need and the things you want and uh and he thought maybe he was just referring to how heavy their packs were but when he came to the place where he thought he was going to die he said he realized the difference between the things you need and the things you want you may want to finish this hike but you need to stop or you're going to die and there's really so much in that thought of what things are necessary what things do we want what things do we desire he says you got to leave what is needless and choose the one thing needful Christ that's quite a statement then brother brandom drawing from that says the great number of teachers he says is the reason of the multitude of sex for which we should soon have no names left now there's going to run out of names for all these religions and all these denominations each church so now it's a church and we're talking about Christianity says each Church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred no reconciliation is to be hoped for between them they meet enmity with ir irreconcilable enity out of the Bible they forg their different Creeds these are their fortresses and bullworks behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks what's amazing is the way that it's described here about their Fortress and bull works it actually what they think to be a a safe place has become a labyrinth through the bullworks and the Fortress and he says they from there they entrench themselves and resist all attacks he says I will not say that these confessions of faith for we can't admit in most cases that they are so are bad in themselves so he's he's not wanting just to say that the confession of faith is bad in itself but then he says they become so however in that they feed the fire of enmity think about how that we could have these peculiar confessions of Faith these certain platitudes or platforms or ideology or uh convictions that we might have and they wouldn't necessarily be bad but they feed the fire of enmity against those who don't share the same one and it causes us to entrench ourselves in these things and we persecute those with the bitterest hatred that don't agree with us and so it becomes uh irreversible irreconcilable he says only by putting them away alt together would it be possible to set to work on healing the wounds of the church it's quite a quite a statement that we could really Ponder on for quite some time but what I would like to say just to open it up to where we are today if this is true of Christ Christianity if this is what the church had become then what of the individual what of the home life what of society that if this is where the the there there should be the purest and truest uh uh form of religion if this is where Christ is supposed to be and it's become this fortresses and bull works and persecution and hatred then what what about those uh the family what about the the world I was fellowshipping with brother Jonathan larga he's a pastor in Croatia a good friend of mine and I just was fellowshipping yes with him yesterday and asked him what he was ministering on today and he said the three delinquencies and and his thought was being brought out of the message where brother B talked about child delinquency and parental delinquency and then how brother bradam says it's Pulpit delinquency and he shared it it just was beautiful the way he shared it with me how that once you have church delinquency it leads to parental delinquency which then leads to child Del quency and then we put it all in the child and we want to punish the child but really brother Brandon was showing us that you kind of back work backwards and go back to the weak pulpits and if you think of that if the church is delinquent and therefore then the home is delinquent and then the children are delinquent family church and then Society becomes full of delinquents and we're in this time of Satan's Eden and the and this evil age wherein the world is full of delinquents and a delinquent is one who fails to perform a Duty or to discharge an obligation so as soon as the church failed to discharge of its Duty it made it harder for the family to discharge its Duty and it made it harder for the children to discharge their Duty and so there is a failure on all parts and it causes Society to break down and and what I'm the reason why I mentioned this is in those three delinquencies as he was putting it it really resonated with me to see how that were we're looking at one thing necessary one thing needful going all the way back to the beginning where man failed to keep his duty and in failing to keep his duty it brought all the sin and death that is in the world today and that if there is as the Bible would tell us one thing that is necessary one thing that is needful then there is this singleness of Duty there are a lot of unnecessary things and one thing that is necessary and if you put it in that light you might say well don't we need to sleep and don't we need to eat and don't need we need to wear clothes but it's what's the one thing you cannot do without what's the one thing that you must have and we would say above all I must have Christ so there is a a singleness of devotion and Duty that we can observe in order to escape this Labyrinth as brother bram's pointing us to we're drawing it from 2 Corinthians Chap 11:3 and Paul says but I fear less by any means as a serpent beg galed eeve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ as brother bradam says the one thing needful Christ as he's bringing that out of camus's work Christ is the one thing needful so Paul is saying I I I fear that by some means by any means the as the serpent beguiled Eve so there's this uh thinking back to the temptation of the woman and then the present condition of the church at that time that in the same manner in which the Eve was deceived I I fear that your minds would be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ so let's grapple with this scripture and in doing so it understand its clear meaning and maybe even a deeper meaning for ourselves personally as the serpent beguiled e through his subtlety now also remember that The Temptations in the garden uh correspond to The Temptations of Christ in the wilderness what we see is the singular temptation of the woman becomes a three-fold temptation to Christ and in God's Paradise man and woman we know they had eternal life and some of this just kind of review some of the things we said on Sunday or excuse me Wednesday night uh but they had eternal life it was real living it's not life as we know it now and say oh this is life and this is living and oh this is the good life and there's a lot of ways that we talk about life uh but then David says thy love and kindness is better than life and we realize that this life is not the purest life or the greatest life but they had real life and they had a there was a fruitful labor that every day had purpose and meaning there was a great satisfaction uh uh at the end of the day and so their labor their work was satisfying the their their pleasure that they engaged in was satisfying in other words it was always enough that when they labored they were happy with whatever their work product was when they sought pleasures they were that satisfied it didn't leave them wanting uh their minds were clear they had a clear understanding they had pure enjoyment they all they had was good so if they ate it was good how did you like that it was good how was the walk it was good everything was good and it was uhh it was perfect and through the fall It produced that three-fold unhappiness where's that there's that frustration of thought of the frustration of action where there's no joy when you get out of your actions frustration of thought is where you don't think correctly the CL the channels have become clogged so men's thought process has become frustrated and then when he acts there's a frustration of Labor and action where he doesn't get the joy out of it that he would like to get so he convinces himself he got it anyways and then there's the frustration of Desire where there's no satiety where I'm never being satisfied that I I I have desire and it can never be quenched I want to I want to do this in order to say I've done it and put it to rest but but there has been this frustration of thinking acting and Desiring that man has existed in ever since the fall as we're putting it this way mankind was thrust into this Labyrinth alienated from God and then we come to the Bible in Ecclesiastes where Solomon begins to observe that life is confusing life is full of Labor and all you get out of life I is is Strife a a and it's full of grief and trouble he writes in the beginning in Ecclesiastes 1:8 All Things Are full of Labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing that's the nature of man's frustration of Desire then he says all the labor of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled Ecclesiastes 67 labor does not satisfy man's thoughts are wrong man's actions don't produce the fruits they'd want it to and then man's desire is always wanting it's the complete opposite of what man found in the beginning comenius at the very beginning of his work Unum necessarium includes a qu a quote from Plato all kinds of knowledge if knowledge of the best is lacking hinder rather than help him who has them that man having left the paradise of God having lost his connection with God could have all sorts of knowledge but with without the knowledge of what is best without the knowledge of God it has hindered him rather than helped him with all his accomplishments and how scientific he's become and how much he's been able to do he's only gotten further away from God trying to remedy The Human Condition he's only heaped upon himself even more problems and we could say oh man they're finding out today that this is a big huge issue and in our minds we might think oh they've missed it all these years but really A lot of them are modern issues brought upon by modern inventions in Psalms 107: 10 11 and 12 such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in Affliction and iron this describes Humanity because they rebelled against the words of God and contemned the counsel of the most high this phrase is appropriate of even the man and the woman in the beginning therefore he brought down their heart with labor they fell down and there was none to help man is in this Darkness under the shadow of death Bound in Affliction and iron it's not literal iron necessarily but it is Affliction through a rebellion against God's word we've been brought down with labor there we cannot escape this as we read Proverbs 21:16 on Wednesday the man that Werth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the the dead as soon as mankind left the way of God and rebelled against his clear uh commandment and clear prohibition man wandered out of the way of understanding supposing that he would gain more understanding and entered into the congregation of the dead man having lived entered into death by sin cannot escape death through sin and having entered into it through misunder understanding cannot Escape it without coming back to the way of understanding righten it was democrates that said the cause of sinning is ignorance of what is better what a statement that we only sin when we are ignorant of what is better if it's presented as a good or evil if it's an either or if it's should I or shouldn't I we only sin when we are truly ignorant or choose to be ignorant of that which is better that's right and we know that the woman as we're taught in the message that veil of lust blinded the woman to God's clear Commandment that thou shalt not it blinded her to the the Commandment of thou shall and thou shalt not the prohibition of Thou shalt not God said don't he meant don't but the serpent confused the woman on God's promise he he he brings it up hasn't God said and she's right and saying God said that we shall not eat it and and he said but because if we eat it the day we eat that day we die and and Satan doesn't say he did say to eat it he just says God knows the day you eat that day you'll become as God's knowing good and evil that you you're you're you're not actually going to die you will not die but you'll actually have more life you'll have more understanding and the Bible does not contradict Satan's proposition because when they ate their eyes were open and in that way they became more like God but they also became more like Satan or became like Satan in Disobedience and there's that hybrid nature that hybrid mixture that even comes up in the man and the woman and we can see that this woman being blinded by lust wanders away from life into death because of the promise of knowledge and Paul is saying I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ this is an appropriate fear he knew how subtle Satan was he knew how he worked he knew his scheming and his plans and as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety we ought to take that to heart and think about the weight of that what he means a as he has beguiled the woman I fear that your minds could be or should be corrupted for the Simplicity that is in Christ now man was given a duty in the beginning he was given a labor he was given a commandment he was told not to do things he wasn't asked to reason it out and figure out why he shouldn't do it but he was just told to stick to what he should do and believe God is to what he should not do and so when man's minds are when Paul brings man's Minds into this or our minds he's speaking of our thought or mental perception it's our understanding it's even our deliberation it's our thought process that your thinking your understanding your perception would be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ what you perceive what you understand or what you think about the word comes from to think upon to heed to ponder or to consider Paul is saying that I fear that your minds or your contemplation your deliberation your ponderings what you heed what you think upon will be corrupted from Christ in Ecclesiastes 7:29 it says look this only have I found that God hath made man upright he made him originally to be upright to be simple but they have sought out many inventions they've mixed themselves with so many things they've sought out many other devices they've come up with ways to try to figure things out and so man was made to be simple but he has sought out many devices contemplations deliberations that our contemplation would be corrupted to be corrupted is to destroy by defiling and to a Jew it could be defiled or it could be destroyed if it's defiled in the slightest degree it wasn't necessary that the whole thing be torn down it wasn't necessary that it needed to be torched it just needed to be stained so Paul said I fear lest your thought process your contemplation your desires the things you Ponder would be defiled in the slightest degree that you'd be led away from knowledge that you'd be led away from the things that are pure and that you would perish so the simple here and I hope to expand on it more maybe in the future the simple implies this unmixed devotion where you don't have your loyalties to the world you don't have your loyalties to this you don't have your loyalties to that but you do have ultimate loyalty in undivided and unmixed Devotion to Christ it speaks of single-mindedness not double-mindedness single-mindedness to where you have clear thought and it's directed solely to Christ it's interesting to note too that this word Simplicity and the scriptures also translated to bountifulness liberality and Liberty in Christ the Simplicity the bountifulness the liberality the Liberty that we have in Christ this is what Paul is saying that he was examining and seeing this Antichrist Spirit work that Satan would try to corrupt your thoughts and your mind where the greatest battle is fought the place he chosen the the beginning that he would uh uh wage a war against us in the church and in the bride to cause our thoughts and our contemplation to be defiled in the slightest degree and thereby leading us into stray thought patterns and actions which do not satisfy or fulfill the Simplicity it's a very rich word in Christ so let me say this and my sermon today is uh I'm I'm having to use a lot of Runway to get to it but it's very simple I guess it should be if you're using Simplicity as part of your foundation but what we need is in Christ what Satan is trying to keep us from is in Christ what we need is in Christ I I wouldn't be I don't mean this to be dismissive uh or overs simplistic but in reality I could say this was absolute Assurance no matter what you're going through in life right now What You Need Is Christ that there there's some thing about Christ that is gives us self-sufficiency that in him we are self-sufficient that all we have need of is in him and say well what if I need my boss to give me a raise well I would think that Christ is the good place to start with that what if I need uh what if I've got this sickness what if I need to lose weight what if I need this Christ Christ is the answer Christ can harmonize thought Christ can harmonized body Christ can give you wisdom on the right ways to approach things Christ is the the answer it's only when man left Christ that we begin to undo ourselves what's amazing is man is accomplish more having let go of his faith in Christ than he has in centuries prior all because he's put Faith in himself and he's been able to cause himself to think oh my aren't we great aren't we Grand look we can produce look we can manufacture whether you want to look at it in a a church sense or in a scientific sense man let loose of his faith in God and went from a horse and buggy to a rocket ship to the Moon in less than a hundred years because what we need is Christ and if we leave the one thing needful all we have left is everything that's truly unnecessary like going to the moon and some may say well we're just doing this because mankind is going to have to have a place to live in a thousand years only because man right is going to do that to the Earth and I would maybe argue that the oceans might be a better place to go so you might want to start buying real estate at the bottom of the ocean I'll sell some to you I got certificates what we need isn't Christ what Satan wants to keep us from is Christ and I don't I don't mind if I run the risk of sounding Baptist or nominal or denominational I I will not be ashamed to say that Christ is all we need no shame in it our Salvation is through Jesus Christ and him alone that Christ is truly all we need in John 10:10 Jesus says the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy that's what the thief comes to do steal kill and destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly to say that we might have life certainly contrast death that we might have life but then he says and they might have it more abundantly how can I have more life if I have life how can I have more life but he's saying that we might have life and that life is more abundant and fulfilling than the life that we now live in the flesh the life that we have received from our parents that uh uh and that we walk through life in trying to explore boundaries and we're trying to figure out who we are and come under our identity and and making use of resources and opportunities whatever it might be no matter how satisfied we could be in this life by merely living from natural life and making use of Natural Things in Christ we can have a more Abundant Life we can have true life in something more abundant and fulfilling am and never even leave this earth even continuing to do the things you did before it's not that when you come to Christ you immediately stop eating and drinking and sleeping and you just stay awake all the time blessing people but you will continue to do many of the same things you have always done but life has deeper meaning there's a connection to something Beyond yourself it's real living and it doesn't mean it's not without its difficulties and Sorrows but Christ said that in him we could have life more abundantly the Bible says in 1 Timothy 5: 5 and 6 now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day it could be said this is what I Widow ought to be this is why Paul commands the single and the widowed in a certain way because of what their their proclivity might be or what they might be tempted to do so a widow ought to trust in God and continue in prayer and supplication night and day and it's immediately contrasted but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth one that does not live trusting in God one that lives according to the flesh we can say that this does describe what brought Humanity into the the sin and darkness that it knows now that the woman when she eateth she wiped her mouth and said I've done no wrong she is dead living in pleasure she that lives in pleasure is dead while she liveth so those that live in sin are dead we being dead in our sins and trespasses so Christ says that he's come that we might have life that we might be quickened from the dead that life where we don't immediately exit the Earth upon our new birth but rather we we enter into the body of Christ and we now are no longer dead but alive and we can have life more abundantly so he admonishes Us in Matthew 11: 28 29 and 30 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden this speaks to all mankind he could have just said come unto me all ye because all mankind labors and is heavy laden we're heavy laden with sins we labor under the chain of carnality and the chains of human thought we are thrust into the labyrinth in this prison of Darkness because we rebelled against the word of God we've we've our heart has been brought down with labor we're Bound in Affliction and iron as it were so he says come you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest I'll cause you to cease from that labor I'll cause you to cease from that heavy burden I'll relieve you of the strain of Desire come under me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest I will relieve you of the frustration of thought I'll relieve you from the frustration of action I will relieve you from the frustration of desire it is only when Christ is not the center when we find that our desires become that Dynamo and that dopamine cycle we enter into and we find ourselves unable to resist because we are no longer finding Rest In Christ the end of the day when we want to have our Escape or get our rest we don't come to Christ or the things that God has given us we find that the world has provided us an escape to just kind of relax and just letting off the steam I've had a long day of work honey just let me relax and let off the Steam and I guess I could get real specific right now but I think maybe it'd be good for us just to think in ourselves the things that we do for recreation and rest and it never quite satisfied because you're you're a Son of God you're a sheep and Christ is your rest so he'll give you rest to a point he'll give you Recreation to a point but if you ever leave the one thing needful there's a law of diminishing returns we say you got to come back to me I'm not saying you can't go fishing I'm not saying you can't do this but if you leave me you'll never get out of that what I can intend it for because you've got to come to me for your rest and we cannot find this rest without first taking his yoke upon us and learning of his example take my yoke upon you if we become unyoked from him to rest we find no rest if we become unyoked from his will to to get our relief or to find pleasure or to um explore to have fun or to uh acquire whatever it might be then we cannot find rest we only enter further into the Labyrinth take my yoke upon you and learn of me this is that chord this is that way out of the the Maze and I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls you will find rest from the frustration of thought desire and action for my yoke is easy and my burden is light Christ though we be yoke to him though we submit ourselves to him though this uh we are subject to Christ being Yol to Christ is where we find Simplicity being yolked to Christ is where we find bountifulness and liberality Liberty being yolked to Christ is where you're going to find your greatest Liberty you could say well prove that and I would say are you a Christian and if you say yes then we've proved it already by scripture if you reject scripture just go to your own teachers go to your own scientists that tells you that I'll tell you that man does not create his own desires he's a prisoner to to things Beyond his control even to the point where many scientists conclude that man does not have his own will they're the ones that take it to the extreme man doesn't even have a choice you think I could even say this to my kids you think you like Dr Pepper but you only like it because I like it and I don't like it because I liked it I liked it because somebody else liked it and you just follow the breadcrumbs all the way back to the serpent in the beginning right that there's these things that man is not his own master so then we must we must be yolked to Christ to find our greatest Liberty this is what Christ is now let's follow in the scripture as the scripture prophesies Christ to us again don't forget that we're talking about that feeding the fire of enmity and this Labyrinth that the church has become and how Through the Bible people have forged their bull workk and fortresses entrench themselves in it and nothing makes it out of the trench except for hatred and persecution but Christ came that's because man was thrust in this Labyrinth of sin All Things Are full of Labor the labor of man never leaves him satisfied man's knowledge of the Divine had been lost therefore all mankind can do is Wonder in the way of darkness and the congregation of the dead man has mixed himself with so many things and Paul is now saying this is the condition of man and Paul saying I fear that you'd beg be beguiled away from the Simplicity that is in Christ and Christ has come that we might have life and have life more abundantly he's come that he could give us rest so this is that Christ now that Paul says that he does not want our minds to be corrupted from and notice how the Bible prophesies in Isaiah 42: 1-7 behold my servant whom I uphold some of the translations say behold my Messiah my elect in whom my soul Delight I have put my spirit upon him this is the Messiah this is Christ he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles and to the Jew that meant punishment to the Gentiles it means righteousness he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break and the smoking flag shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till Heath set judgment in the Earth the aisle shall wait for his law thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that Spread spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein what a leadup what an entrance what an introduction I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will uphold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles I love how the prophecy brings us back to the creation of heavens and earth to the purpose of God in the beginning the very that mankind fell from thei Messiah is going to come in righteousness and he has given as a covenant for the light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house this prison in that Hebrew is this dark enclosure it's a dungeon the labyrith was an underground prison that lath is that is a type of this Dark World which we have become a prisoner too L groping in darkness Bound by sin in Chains of death but Christ the Messiah is going to be a light to the Gentiles to open eyes that cannot see to bring out prisoners who are in the prison and to them that sit in darkness out of the prison house this is a prophecy of Christ so Luke chapter 1 starting with verse 76 and thou child shall be called the prophet of the highest this is John the Baptist for Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways this is what the Messiah is going to do to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God whereby the day spring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet in the way of PE peace I'd like for you to think about Christ as how he has been placed as the one that lets the prisoner out of prison that lets the one who's in the darkness of the prison house out into light that Christ is the gospel that calls us out of Darkness that Christ is the one that looses the shackles of sin and death and a lack of understanding that he's to give the knowledge of Salvation to give light to those that sit in darkness and in the shadow to guide our feet in the way of Peace Christ then becomes the Escape From The Labyrinth from the darkness from the dungeon we read already in Psalms 107 we read verses 10 to 12 such a sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in Affliction and iron you see the Symmetry to these verses in Isaiah and Luke chapter 1 because they rebelled against the word of God and contemned the counsel of the most high therefore he brought down their heart with labor they fell down and there was none to help then they Cried unto the Lord of their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and break their bands aunder this is Luke 179 to give light to them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death to give our guide our feet in the way of Peace he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and break their bands in a sun all that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men oh that we ought to praise God for Jesus Christ who came to Deliver Us from the prison house to set us free and to give a light unto our feet that we may walk in the way of peace I hope that you're able to begin to peace together at least this part or focus on it not that you need to piece it together but just refocus that when Paul says I fear that Satan would try to beguile you and deceive you away from the Simplicity that is in Christ that your contemplations your thoughts and and your thinkings would be defiled ever so slightly from the singleness of mind and Devotion to Christ that you would think a lot of other things were more needful than Christ the one thing needful the one who came to give us rest to give us life and have it more abundantly a light to lighten the Gentiles as it says in Luke 2:32 that's what he was a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel Christ is to be revealed to the Gentiles to bring understanding and knowledge to open up blind eyes to show them the way we know the Gentiles scripturally were lost they were blind they had no Pro prophets and Promises they were wandering they were Godless what was Christ to be the one to give them purpose the one to give them meaning the one to rescue them from their sins it's upon this truth that I want you to look at what brother bradam is saying in the sardan church age how that denominational Zeal was causing people to build churches as fortresses and use the Bible to forge Creeds and use them for attacks and for defense and their confessions of faith and their confessions of Christ only fed the fire of hatred and only by putting them away could you start to heal the wounds of the church only only by putting away your confessions that you use as a sword your confessions that you use as a shield only by getting out of the bullworks and fortresses could you begin to heal the wounds of the church I would argue that some of us who've been wounded by the church will only begin to heal when we lay down the sword that church gave us and the shield that church gave us and Trust Christ I take this from the one thing needful is brother Bram called it by comenius listen to how he says this now I want you I'm reading this with the idea of Christ what Christ is what Paul was concerned we would be beguiled and defiled by and then what it had become as brother bradam identified religion as comenius writes the chain of communication between the created mind and the uncreated interesting way of describing it religion ought to bring soulless in all worldly perplexities and not not only to show a secure Port from the stormy hurricanes of worldly Affairs but also ought to lead into it religion should be a soulless from the lath religion should be safety and a secure Port during a time of perplexities but then religion also ought to lead us into the perplexities lead us into the hurricane as it were lead us into the Tempest that's what it ought to be but how does religion fulfill this we ask ourselves this question religious ought to give us comfort in world of perplexities it ought to give us safety in the worldly hurricanes it ought to lead us through these devastating storms but how does religion fulfill this already she herself has become a more perplexing lab than any other in the whole world for first instead of one there are innumerable religions and these have split again among them s into many others nothing but a labyrinth this is so evident especially to subtle political Minds that many now having come to suspect that no religion is true but all false are throwing aside Divinity himself in fear of the Divine and are slipping into atheism by seeking light in darkness itself security and sluggishness of the conscience life in death what has given such momentum to science that denies God the failure of religion presuming that no religion is true they throw aside Christ himself in the fear of God and slip into atheism trying to get light out of Darkness Security in a sluggish mind and conscience life out of death alas in truth he eism was a fable insane with the multitude of gods and Idols but neither can Judaism be considered much better for although it took its Origins from the true God himself creator of us all it degenerated however through undermining Corruptions into fism that is a chaos of superstitions muhammadans is no better he's saying religion Judaism doesn't have the answer people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region the shadow of death light is sprung up this is what Christ is to the people which sat in darkness they saw great light those in the region and Shadow death light is sprung up Jesus Christ Our Only Hope and he begins to preach and say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand not the kingdom of man not the kingdom of of Satan not this a labyrinth not this menur not any kind of Mythology but the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand it is Jesus who declares in John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh under the father but by me there is no access to God there is no salvation besides Jesus Christ he says I am the way the truth and the life this is what Christ is when Paul says I would that you would not be defiled from the Simplicity that is in Christ it is the Simplicity that he is the way the truth and the life that without the way there is no going without the truth there is no knowing without the life there is no living that you must have Christ Christ is the way and Isaiah 358 and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not a therein the way is going to be so direct and straight that not even the ignorant could air on it that you don't have to be learned you don't have to be smart you don't have to be a scientist the way so clear so direct so true that not even a fool should Heir well that's what Christ should be so commenius continues only the Christian religion having for a leader him who is the way truth and life is believed to be certainly ought to be the holy way of Zion promised by the prophet so direct that not even the stupid are able to wander along the way but is it alas alas in the whole world scarcely a more intricate Labyrinth can be found than the Christian religion such it is now has become this is what brother Bram is saying in this time of the sardian age the 17th century as it's being written it's a Christian religion is so Multiplex I say and varied and divided into so many sects and cut up into so many thousand questions about faith and opinions about individual questions and battles over opinions that the whole world has nothing similarly intricate that's amazing there's no more branches of thought more disciplines more schools he's saying in the Christian religion than in science the Christian religion has so varied and multiplexed and divided in so many questions about faith and opinions and individual questions and battles over opinions that one has a confession and then there's a question about the uh uh or an opinion about uh this stance so one has to have an opinion on the opinion well he thinks that great what what's your opinion about what about whether or not it's great no about your what do you think about him thinking that it's great so you're not even weighing in on whether or not it actually is great no you're just weighing on the fact that he thinks it is and then if I weigh in on the fact that he thinks it's great then someone's got to weigh in on what I think about what he thinks and this has been the game that has unfolded ever since he says there's nothing in the world more intricate than Christianity and Paul said he feared that as a serpent beguiled Eve through his solty our minds our contemplation our our thoughts and our understanding would be defiled in the slightest degree for the Simplicity that is in Christ did Paul view it in the sense that as a Jew the slightest impurity destroyed it all or could it be that he saw that just given a a small inch how far it could go that if we left in the slightest degree we were more susceptible to leave in entirety that if we weren't true in devotion and singleness of mind to Christ that it left open multiple avenues for us to be led astray and for us to do our Dianes and to give in to fleshly whims was he concerned that the devil would find just the slightest room to work and thereby take full advantage our minds would be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ and verse four for he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him another Jesus another Spirit another gospel if we looked at it this way Christ is the way the truth the life Christ there is is that is Jesus then the spirit the way the truth of Life the the gospel the way the truth of Life the multiplicity now with which it's broken up that there's Jesus there's another Jesus there's another spirit and another gospel Paul is not saying all is one but the breaking up of it to it could even be suggested even in the times with the word of God that there's a difference between the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost and the technicalities and the splitting of hairs put people in this state of even thinking wow that's super deep or oh my goodness did I get the ghost or the spirit which one do I really want all these other ways remember we read about uh on Sir Francis Bacon how he was talking about the cause of atheism and he said divisions in religion and he said that if religion was just divided in two if there was just one uh main division it would add Zeal to both sides so if Christianity was just split between the Catholic church and the Lutheran Church then the Catholics become more Catholic the Lutheran more Luther and it would just add Zeal to both sides but it would just be binary that's all there would be but Satan not being interested in being binary that there was this cause to split everything up innumerable and so with the multiplicity with many divisions he said it introduced atheism that if there was only if there was only Christianity and paganism it would add Zeal to both sides but the more that you split up Christianity the more it introduced paganism the more it introduces atheism and so Paul was concerned that another Jesus would be preached and that if another Jesus was preached then another Spirit would be introduced with another Spirit to be another gospel another gospel apart from the spirit in Jesus another uh spirit apart from the gospel in Christ all these different ways that it could be chopped up and divided up I know that there's times when the message is criticized because of the the the many different views that one could have in the message and some believe this and some believe that and some are two souls and some are no souls and some are polygamist and some are this and there's all sorts of ideas and they'll use that as a stain against the message but I would argue that if the message restored to us the Bible it's understandable that the Bible which is spawn a billion thoughts and opinions and divisions that it would be the devil would be near to cause the same with the restoration of Truth and I know that's not an indefensible argument and that doesn't shut up the critics but it's the truth that the Bible Christianity itself is plagued with divisions and Zeal even being added to those divisions that have become bull Works fortresses Paul said in Galatians 1: 6-9 I Marvel now this is think about this in terms of him writing to the Corinthians say man I I I'm concerned that a one would come preaching another Jesus or you would receive another Spirit or accept another gospel that uh is not Christ or that is not the holy spirit that is not the word of God I I I'm concerned that this is what would happen by you being led astray ever so slightly through the son IES of Satan and your contemplation and your singleness of Devotion to Christ that just ever slow so slightly would be compromised that you would fall for these other things or that you'd support it sustain it agree with it but now notice what he says to the Galatians I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel he's saying that they have stepped that it be ever so slightly they have stepped to another gospel they've been removed from another GOP to another gospel he says which is not another to make it clear there cannot be another good news there cannot be another Christ there cannot be another Jesus so anyone supposing a Jesus that is not Jesus is a false Christ you're removed from the grace of Christ unto another gospel he says but there cannot be another gospel there cannot be another Jesus but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ and this is how adamant Paul is but though we are an angel from Heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a cursed the gospel is Christ If any man preach un you any other gospel than what Paul preached let him be a curse and we said therefore say I now again if any man preach any other gospel to you then you have received let him be a cursed it's quite a statement No Doubt anyone can use it to remain where they are oh I Reed Methodist teaching I'm a Methodist I receive this teaching I receive that teaching that's the one I received I will not be moved from it because Paul said I should not be removed from the gospel unto something else and anyone that tries to remove me from it let them be a curse be sure that what you're standing on is Christ be sure it lines up with the word and all the word make sure that at its heart and its core it is the Simplicity of Christ and not a man-made bull workk or Fortress comia says and what is more astonishing nowhere in the world on account of religious dentations dissensions are there such harsh hatreds such enduring quarrels such bloody persecutions such cruel punishments and such atrocious battles I get the feeling that he even had more and his editor said ah cut it stop it's enough harsh hatreds enduring quarrels bloody persecutions cruel punishments atrocious battles isn't it amazing that in the context of religion it's often that one would rather you deny Faith altogether to deny Christ altogether to become Godless then to serve a Christ that doesn't align with their version of Christ listen there's a DNA of carnal Christianity that Harbors within us resentments and bitterness and judgments of other people and their differences of opinions or doctrines or convictions that is not of Christ but is from the Labyrinth it is the enduring quarrels that still abide in man-made religion he says indeed one party of the Christians believes that it is outside the Labyrinth and says that if all are subordinate to subordinated one to the other under one head then Discord seen everywhere in the other sect cannot easily arise this is the truth if we could all just come under the banner of this truth then all confusion would be eradicated this is what he's saying that there's some Christians that believe that we are not the Labyrinth we are not the Fortress we are not the bullwark and if everybody would just come under the banner of our religion then all the cha that exists in these other thoughts and ideas will subside but he he he says but if someone looks near at the laws of their Concord their bylaws their Doctrine their theology he will see a labyrinth cly constructed to be sure more skillfully made than all but still a labyrinth and certainly larger than any elsewhere ever this could be said of the Catholic church this could be said of all the denominations that were coming up with their zeal with centuries of study with with power and Prestige with Legacy with so much to hold on to they wanted to bind the people wealth was an incredible motivator incredible motivator to the church and to denominations organized religion in this time they preached a gospel that kept the people poor they preached the gospel that kept them Bound in a prison and in a a labyrinth and the only way out was to walk the this is what's amazing is the Labyrinth became a symbol of pilgrimage in cathedrals and Catholic churches and and and cathedrals of other Christian religions all over Europe and around the world that ones would walk as a sign of devotion not realizing that it was a symbol of what they had become and the way that mankind I read a book within the last couple years about a man who who took this pilgrimage all the way from England to Rome and walked it and traveled it as other as they would have done in the days gone by and he was just visiting the different uh Catholic Cathedrals and the history of it and the monasteries and to see just how much how dark it was how much it served man and not the cause of Christ Christ this is what's being described here Babylon and all her daughters the Labyrinth of oh what if you just accepted the universal if you just accepted this everything would go away but Paul said there's some among you who will pervert the gospel of Christ Jude Jude said it this way beloved when I gave all diligence to write un you of the common salvation there's only one that's what he means by all common salvation it was needful for me to Rite on you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered under the Saints not just once in the sense that it was previously but it's one gospel the faith the common salvation which there's not another there's one Jesus and one Christ he said for there certain there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ the Galatians were soon removed from the grace of Christ into another gospel the Corinthians were warned that they would not be corrupted for the Simplicity that is in Christ and not bear with another Jesus another Spirit or another gospel Judah is saying that the Antichrist spirit is already at work amongst you men who've crept in turning you from the grace of God into lasciviousness and denying God and his son Jesus Christ this is at work before the Bible is even finished so commenius concludes in short and you'll find this in the church age book in short all things of Christians brother R says christiandom all the things of Christians have become a labyrinth you'll recognize this faith has been cut up into thousands of minute articles and If you deny one of these you are a heretic life has been divided into a thousand matters of conscience and if you don't keep all of these your Scruples are questioned now I'm talk we're talking we're talking about the Labyrinth that's what we're talking about life and living and how that Christianity the message can get flipped around where Christ is not the head but the head is all the minute details and articles and all the whether or not you're keeping this and whether or not you're keeping that and then if you don't do it your Scruples are questioned your your your conscience is called into question and then it says in the case of desire and hope oh this just was so powerful in the case in the matter of desire and hope here are very many who are ignorant of what they may pray for or hope for and from whom through whom and with what faith and therefore they are they either supported by blind hope or cast down by certain desperation this is organized religion entering into the 18th century this is organized religion and it was only going to get worse until God would come and restore it there are others who turn the whole worship I'm I'm going be I'm not going to finish I I took some quotes quotations out and some things I wanted to get into Harvest Time but I want to I want you to think about this in context of the message where we are today on how we take the word of God and we we make it really topheavy where all all the signs and all the Wonders and all the details and all the Articles have the preeminence and not Christ it's been turned into a labyrinth so there's some who don't know who to pray to and in not knowing who to pray to they either have blind hope which is not Faith or they just lose hope altogether and he said there are others who turn the whole ownership of the Divinity into ceremonies and others either cast aside or neglect worship itself along with ceremonies and to be sure all this has such diversity that if anyone could look at everything at the same time now he's descri described a lot of stuff now if we could look at Christianity today or even those forms of religion that are very near ours if one could look at all of it at one moment he would see no other spectacle than as if he should see an innumerable mass of men claiming to proceed on the same road but some of them go to the right others go to the left these go up those down others go forward and others backwards and what is more strange is some go on their feet and others on their heads do you get the picture do we need to have one of the kids these artists that we have amongst us draw it out they're all saying we believe in Christ we're all Christians we believe the message of the hour they all claim to believe they all claim to be of the one religion as as com says the one that ought to bring hope the one that ought to be the singular way the truth the life the one that ought to lead us out of Labyrinth Christianity itself has become a labyrinth and if we were able to view Christianity all at one time they would all say we're all Christians we're all going to heaven and this is a way and all their voices harmonizing to that one platitude but all their directions and actions not in SN up down left right and then others on their feet and others on their heads Paul said in Colossians chapter 2 the musicians could come verses 6 7 and 8 as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so ye walk in him I leave this to you to think about in terms of the Simplicity that is in Christ as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosopy philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ the way he says it beware lest you be spoiled through philosophy spoiled through vain deceit spoiled after tradition or spoiled after the r rudiments of the world and not spoiled after [Music] Christ beware this is the challenge and light of these things this Labyrinth we're living in it's maybe put in what you might consider anxious or classic thought but it's very real where we're living today as you've received Christ walk in him be rooted in him built up in him established in him and don't let any man spoil you through philosophy vain deceit tradition or rudiments of the world but only be after Christ as I was thinking about it last week maybe I'm just looking at this picture in my mind and wondering if I've been able to adequately convey the burden that was in my heart [Music] Christ it is all about Christ all of it every single bit of it it's Jesus Christ this message is Jesus Christ even if we get into the seals and the Thunders it's all Christ take Christ out of it you're you're your what are you left some other ISM so it's Christ and then we think okay the Simplicity that is in Christ and then you say well I mean even if we just took the New Testament there's a lot here we say well the message reveals Christ well we got 47 to 65 and what's this Continuum of of what is important and what's necessary in church order and and Doctrine and question and answers and you try to figure all this stuff out and and for me there's a way that we we're working we're undoing Christ like we're untangling him and we're chopping him up into a thousand pieces to see if we have them to see if we find them and and then trying to put it together again or trying to piece it together as if that was our job when I could I could say this there is a Jesus Christ who can be personally revealed to you and in there it satisfies that that is the most important and if I was to meet somebody who who absolutely and adamantly de denied the message and said it was say satanic but yet stood upon this proposition that they believe they had met Jesus Christ face to face then I could say Well it it what your theology or belief or your experience may not comport or line up with my Bible but I can say that my Bible says that what your confessing to be your ultimate is what your ultimate ought to be and only you can answer for yourself and your conscience whether you not you have found the Prince of Peace NE whether or not you have found life life more abundantly in other words instead of trying to take the message of the hour and put together a puzzle to find Christ in it say h well I wonder if this fits and I wonder if that fits we come to Christ the one thing needful and in him is everything that we have need of and then anything that we come across in our life that we come up against that we don't know how to fit that we don't know where it fits with Christ then we just wait until he can show us we trust him that he's leading us because when I this is the way I looked at it and maybe I'm just trying to pour these things out of my heart that I read that there are so many things that we're to do as Christians but I find that the gospel is Christ first the rest will take care of itself and the the the rest is not just left to our imagination or our own interpretation but the word says that this is what a Christian ought to do so I don't do these things to become a Christian or find Christ but having found Christ and him being the center of my life and what I pursue and what I desire and I have the Simplicity of Christ then what I expect and what I hope for is that the words that I read in the Bible would become true in my life and where I see that it doesn't line up I do not redefine the Christ I have received and I do not lament that I have not found him but rather I trust and pray that that which has promised will come true in my life so that if I believe that I am born again that I am a Son of God and the Bible says Thou shalt not Thou shalt not or Thou shalt and I find that I have not then I rather say this has formed for me the path that I must take and the word has enlightened me that I must love my wife as Christ loves the church that I should not frustrate my children that I should do these things that the Bible says a Christian should do and I know that all things are possible through Christ who gives me strength and that I have not defined Christ by the multitude of Commandments that are in the word but rather I find that Christ is a person who is the word that has found that I have found favor with who I love and who I'm devoted to and I trust in him that these details in the word of God would be made flesh in my [Music] life I think this the the concept of the labyrinth was important for brother brandham to introduce us to it and he says this brother brandham writes this what can help what can [Music] help only the one thing needful return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith do you realize that there's a way that we can try to honor the message that in fact dishonors [Music] it it doesn't stumble anybody does it that we could and maybe maybe I shouldn't have done this at 11:45 but there's a way that we think we're being really we're honoring the message we're being real strict we're going to obey every word but if you leave Christ out of it or if it becomes another gospel or another Spirit or another Jesus it's in plain contradiction to the messenger who said one thing is needful return to Christ look into Christ as your only leader walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith I love this as the Heavenly Master Built everything on the ground of the scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of of God which belongs to us all listen in the message of the hour there there's always seasons and and turnovers and things that come and go and waves and different movements where people have the particularities of their special confessions and there's a season of this and there's a season of that and listen if God wants to move a particular way in a particular place in a particular fashion for a particular time then let God have his way but as for me and my basis and my Foundation I want to leave all the particular arities of our special confessions and have one Foundation the revealed word which belongs to us all and not use our special confessions in our individual experiences as swords or Shields and as ways of entrenching ourselves in the Labyrinth and truly there is no need for us to lift up a banner and say no our our church our take on this is the one that is not amazed and is not confusing but to just lift the Banner of Christ hi I have great confidence in knowing that the message of the hour revealed Jesus Christ that it's truth there's times that people say oh well that so and so introducing the message or they want to be baptized and live in such and such place where should they go to church and and you're immediately you begin to think wow what what kind of church is it what do they teach and who's the pastor and things like that and I think those questions are valid and you realize well how presumptuous would it be to think that any one church has all the truth and nothing but the truth and is perfect and and this is what the message is apart from trusting in God that he's the one that's looking out over all of it and that at the end of the day Christ we he's the one that must have preeminence I I'll say this closing I believe that we should look at the message of the hour through look at this this emphasis of the message of the hour of this correction against the labyrinth in organized religion and not with the lens or view to make the message another one but that it was wanting to introduce us to Christ the way out of them all yet man ourselves and our own Humanity we can make a labyrinth out of it but remember Christ is the answer the way out of them all let's stand together this
