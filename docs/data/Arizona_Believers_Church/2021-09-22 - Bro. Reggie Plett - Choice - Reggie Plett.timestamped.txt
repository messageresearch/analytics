[0:00] if you have your bibles while i have you
[0:02] uh standing with me uh in honor of the
[0:05] word i'd like to
[0:07] remain standing and read over in hebrews
[0:10] chapter 11
[0:11] this is no surprise i'm if if you uh
[0:16] have heard
[0:17] we've been in the book of hebrews for a
[0:19] while uh with a bible study um
[0:23] with our employees and so uh it's
[0:26] certainly my children are are probably
[0:29] cringing thinking here we go another
[0:31] lesson from the book of hebrews from dad
[0:33] but uh it's just so good you know you
[0:35] just this is meat that you can chew on
[0:38] uh for a while and and it doesn't lose
[0:41] its flavor
[0:42] hebrews chapter 11.
[0:45] um
[0:47] we'll begin at
[0:49] uh let's just begin at verse 23
[0:52] and we'll read down
[0:54] through verse 26
[0:57] by faith moses when he was born was hid
[1:01] three months of his parents
[1:03] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:06] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:08] commandment
[1:09] by faith moses when he was come to years
[1:13] refused to be called the son of
[1:16] pharaoh's daughter
[1:17] choosing
[1:18] rather
[1:20] to suffer affliction
[1:22] with the people of god
[1:24] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:27] for a season
[1:29] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[1:32] riches
[1:34] than the treasures in egypt for he had
[1:36] respect unto the recompense
[1:39] of the reward
[1:41] amen let's just bow our heads for a word
[1:43] of prayer
[1:44] lord jesus we thank you god that we have
[1:48] the freedom lord to come into a place
[1:50] and to read this word of god
[1:53] lord the bible is such a precious thing
[1:55] to us lord it
[1:57] is
[1:58] we realize
[1:59] your
[2:00] word says that heavens and earth will
[2:02] pass away but not one word of god will
[2:05] pass
[2:06] and lord we are resting in that lord we
[2:09] uh when all things seem to fall
[2:12] around us god
[2:14] there's one thing we have found sure in
[2:16] our lives and that is your word
[2:18] and god not just your word but your
[2:20] spirit along with your word and lord we
[2:23] thank you for that we ask god that you
[2:26] would take this word tonight
[2:28] that lord you would find good betting
[2:30] ground in our hearts to place and plant
[2:32] that word that it would bring forth
[2:34] fruit lord for you
[2:36] and god for your harvest
[2:38] we ask that you would be pleased with us
[2:41] lord
[2:42] in our offering of thanksgiving and
[2:44] praise that we give to you tonight
[2:47] lord we believe again that in your
[2:50] presence
[2:51] god all things are possible lord we are
[2:54] asking that you would raise up those
[2:56] that would be sick those perhaps even in
[2:59] the hospital
[3:00] lord jesus that would call upon your
[3:02] name believing
[3:04] lord that in divine healing that you are
[3:07] still
[3:09] our healer and lord god we pray that you
[3:12] would encourage those that are
[3:14] discouraged and bring back the
[3:15] backslider into the fold we ask that god
[3:18] you would do this for we ask these
[3:20] things in jesus christ's name amen man
[3:24] god bless you you can be seated
[3:29] i send greetings from
[3:31] sister grace my wife who could not
[3:34] be with us this evening and
[3:36] thought that it would probably be a good
[3:38] thing also if she didn't come that the
[3:40] two-year-old wouldn't come either
[3:42] and
[3:43] so i hope you all enjoy the noise free
[3:46] service tonight from at least our
[3:48] two-year-old
[3:49] and it's good to see our friends each
[3:51] and every one of you um
[3:54] certainly happy to be
[3:56] gathered
[3:58] in a place of friends and not a hostile
[4:01] environment
[4:03] uh it makes it so much nicer um we've
[4:05] been studying
[4:07] in the book of hebrews
[4:08] um
[4:10] with some employees during a bible study
[4:12] and
[4:13] i just want to make it note of the time
[4:16] and we've come upon
[4:19] hebrews chapter 11 and i would say
[4:21] hebrews chapter 11 is probably one of
[4:23] the more
[4:25] preached upon chapters
[4:27] in in in
[4:29] in
[4:30] in the bible
[4:31] and so
[4:33] um
[4:35] i
[4:36] as we got to chapter 11 in our bible
[4:38] study one of the young men
[4:41] took a look at these
[4:45] each and every character that was
[4:47] mentioned in this book
[4:49] and they said you know it seems
[4:52] so many times that when i read about the
[4:54] faith of these individuals that we read
[4:57] about in the bible it seems like they've
[4:59] got real faith
[5:01] and sometimes when i look at the
[5:03] decisions that i've made in my life
[5:06] i
[5:06] question whether is it is it faith or is
[5:10] it not faith that i'm doing the things
[5:12] that i'm doing because it seems as
[5:14] though perhaps the the decisions that i
[5:17] make in life they don't
[5:19] stack up to be
[5:22] maybe as crucial as what we read about
[5:25] some of these characters in the bible
[5:28] um the decisions that they made
[5:31] but
[5:32] the conclusion that this young man made
[5:33] in the bible study was nonetheless it is
[5:36] faith that that
[5:38] that even i as a christian today the
[5:41] decisions that i make for
[5:44] uh for for the word of god and and for
[5:47] our lord
[5:48] it is still the same faith
[5:52] and i i i want to turn over
[5:55] um
[5:56] before i get too far ahead of myself
[5:58] over into the book of mark
[6:01] and i want to read you a portion of
[6:03] scripture
[6:06] in mark chapter 10 and i'll explain to
[6:08] you the purpose of this and i want to
[6:10] begin at verse 17
[6:12] and read down to the 22nd verse
[6:15] and when he was gone forth into the way
[6:18] there came one running and kneeled
[6:21] to him and asked him
[6:23] good master
[6:24] what shall i do that i may inherit
[6:27] eternal life
[6:29] and jesus said unto him why call us thou
[6:31] me good there is none good but one that
[6:34] is god
[6:36] thou knowest the commandments do not
[6:38] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[6:41] do not bear false witness defraud not
[6:44] honor thy father and mother and he
[6:46] answered and said unto him master
[6:49] all these have i observed from my youth
[6:53] and jesus beholding him loved him
[6:57] and said unto him
[6:58] one thing thou lackest
[7:01] go thy way
[7:02] sell whatsoever thou hast and give to
[7:05] the poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[7:07] heaven
[7:08] and come
[7:10] take up the cross and follow me
[7:12] and he was sad at that saying and went
[7:15] away grieved
[7:17] for he had great possessions
[7:22] this evening i'd like to speak to you
[7:24] about choice
[7:30] and i took these notes for a bible study
[7:33] i was going to do for a group of young
[7:36] people
[7:40] and
[7:41] the lord knows my heart
[7:43] i love to talk to the young people i i
[7:46] i believe that
[7:49] these children are the cream of the crop
[7:51] as far as the children go
[7:53] um
[7:55] i believe that
[8:01] i've seen a desire from
[8:04] so many young people to serve god
[8:07] like we would serve god
[8:09] and i believe that um
[8:14] they too have choices you know
[8:16] one place brother branham said
[8:18] uh there are two changes of life that we
[8:22] go through and most of us know about
[8:26] that middle of life
[8:28] that transition in the middle of life
[8:30] and and many people go through what they
[8:32] would call a midlife crisis
[8:34] but brother branham said that
[8:36] there's
[8:37] also a change of life from the
[8:40] adolescents
[8:42] into a young adult that that is also a
[8:45] great change of life
[8:47] and
[8:50] and i can say amen to that i can
[8:53] remember boy that was a tough transition
[8:55] in life
[8:57] going from that age and so i don't want
[8:59] to overlook our our young people i don't
[9:02] want to overlook our children
[9:04] and so
[9:05] uh if you all will just bear with me
[9:08] um
[9:10] i'd like to talk about
[9:12] choice tonight and i believe um this
[9:15] discussion i've had this discussion with
[9:17] brother lucas i believe he also put
[9:19] together i think a little uh study and
[9:22] maybe he talked to the young people
[9:23] about choice as well
[9:25] from my recollection of our discussion
[9:28] and i i i
[9:29] i hope that this isn't just um
[9:34] just a rip-off of of of his study
[9:37] um but that something that we can each
[9:39] glean from tonight
[9:42] uh viktor frankl said everything can be
[9:45] taken from a man but one thing
[9:48] the last of the human freedoms
[9:51] to choose one's attitude
[9:54] in any given set of circumstances
[9:57] to choose one's own way
[10:01] now viktor frankl was a a psychiatrist i
[10:04] believe a psychologist and
[10:06] a survivor of the nazi holocaust
[10:10] and
[10:11] he has put together i think
[10:16] i don't know what i think what they call
[10:17] it but something called logotherapy
[10:20] logos therapy
[10:21] and um
[10:23] he
[10:24] believes that
[10:27] adversity and things in life help us
[10:31] make decisions to find meaning in life
[10:35] and and we find that to be true we we
[10:37] can see that even in the word of god
[10:40] but choice
[10:42] here viktor frankl says is the last of
[10:46] the human freedoms
[10:48] and
[10:49] choice
[10:50] ah
[10:53] comes to each and every one of us and
[10:56] more than one time a day
[10:58] and i've always said it like this um the
[11:02] choices you make is like dropping uh a
[11:05] pebble
[11:06] in a in a in a
[11:08] pond
[11:09] or or a lake and it causes ripples the
[11:12] choice you make will affect
[11:15] you and others around you
[11:18] more than you think just the the
[11:20] one-time drop
[11:22] does because the ripples will will go on
[11:24] and on and on and you say well
[11:27] that scares me a little bit
[11:29] i don't know if i want my decisions to i
[11:32] don't know what kind of effect it's
[11:34] going to have on others around me and
[11:36] that so that scares me a little bit and
[11:38] so
[11:39] maybe i don't want to make a choice you
[11:42] know we laugh um
[11:44] i'm sure some of you have have gone
[11:46] through this
[11:48] um
[11:49] when you finish a service maybe a sunday
[11:51] morning service and the family gets in
[11:53] the car and it's where are we going to
[11:55] eat
[11:56] and
[11:57] everybody says well i don't know you
[11:58] choose well you know i don't know you
[12:00] choose you choose you choose
[12:02] and and they're they're so many times
[12:05] our families probably sat in the car for
[12:07] 10 minutes
[12:08] trying to create or somebody to come up
[12:11] with a decision uh you know where are we
[12:13] going to eat and and uh a lot of times
[12:16] it ends up a fast food because we we
[12:18] just couldn't make up our minds
[12:20] but if you're if you say well i just
[12:21] don't want to make the choice
[12:23] well
[12:24] failure to make a choice is still a
[12:26] choice
[12:31] and it too will have effect in your life
[12:36] now i read these scriptures here
[12:38] um
[12:39] and and your homework i always like to
[12:42] leave congregations with homework uh is
[12:44] to go
[12:46] in your in your own with with your own
[12:48] choice
[12:49] at your own
[12:50] true choice of time even to go and
[12:53] listen to a message called leadership
[12:55] roman reads these
[12:57] scriptures here in that message
[13:00] leadership and he's showing the
[13:02] difference between two young men
[13:05] the the young man moses who was a rich
[13:07] young ruler and this young man found in
[13:10] mark chapter 10 who also was a rich
[13:13] young ruler and each of them was faced
[13:15] with a choice
[13:17] and one chose one way to live for god
[13:21] and one chose
[13:23] unfortunately another way and we find
[13:26] him in another scripture with his eyes
[13:28] lifting up in hell
[13:32] begging for a drop of water
[13:41] and last week
[13:43] a week ago tonight
[13:45] we
[13:46] listened in to the service here brother
[13:49] aaron preached a service
[13:51] called
[13:52] blind trust bad faith
[13:56] and i thought it was tremendous
[13:58] and i
[14:00] would be happy to sign up for the puzzle
[14:02] club
[14:03] that brother aaron was
[14:06] talking about putting together
[14:08] uh
[14:09] and it and i i think it's a little bit
[14:12] humorous the very next day while we were
[14:14] having the bible study
[14:16] brother aaron's uncle
[14:18] brother dennis mcgeary was at the bible
[14:20] study and he happened to be talking
[14:22] about
[14:24] putting the puzzle together as well and
[14:26] i thought did you listen into the
[14:27] service and he didn't i i confirmed he
[14:30] did not listen into the service but he
[14:31] was talking about you know i used to
[14:35] i used to put the puzzle pieces together
[14:38] by looking at the shape of the puzzle
[14:40] piece he says but as i've gotten older
[14:44] i've learned to
[14:45] uh
[14:46] be able to look at the color of of the
[14:49] thing and be able to put the the pieces
[14:51] together by by the by where they go
[14:55] in the color of course he wasn't talking
[14:57] about actually
[14:58] puzzles he was talking about ministering
[15:01] and and looking at the bigger picture
[15:03] um
[15:05] and i
[15:06] and
[15:08] this might seem strange that i keep
[15:10] going along this line of the puzzles but
[15:12] i'm colorblind and so i don't have that
[15:15] choice so many times to look at the
[15:18] color and so i
[15:20] i was when brother aaron was saying you
[15:23] know maybe i should just
[15:24] put together a class on how to build
[15:26] puzzles i thought brother i'm signed me
[15:29] up
[15:30] not just for
[15:31] literally building puzzles
[15:34] but i thought
[15:35] the way he put together
[15:39] blind trust
[15:40] and bad faith and discussing thomas
[15:44] and discussing the different characters
[15:46] of the bible who didn't come
[15:49] out of just blind trust to the lord that
[15:53] they had received a testimony and seen
[15:56] something whether it was in the word of
[15:59] god or
[16:00] in the life of christ or in the life of
[16:03] a believer
[16:05] that caused them to have
[16:07] trust to put their trust
[16:09] in in jesus christ and therefore they
[16:12] could have faith
[16:14] in what they were believing
[16:18] and
[16:19] i thought oh
[16:21] lord
[16:24] i i find that so
[16:26] so well thought out
[16:28] that i thought you know
[16:31] brother aaron was saying you know i
[16:33] don't know if when i'm going to get back
[16:34] to this subject
[16:37] and i thought well man that's exactly
[16:39] where i want to talk about
[16:40] is is is that faith and that trust
[16:45] when we discuss choice tonight
[16:48] and
[16:48] uh it
[16:51] i'm sure i'm not gonna touch anything
[16:53] that he's he's where he's going
[16:56] but
[16:57] um
[16:58] i just find it remarkable i was thinking
[17:01] about
[17:02] when brother aaron was speaking of
[17:04] of thomas
[17:06] and how that thomas simply desired to
[17:10] have the same experience the other
[17:12] disciples had
[17:14] that they had seen the lord resurrected
[17:17] they met him when on their way to the
[17:20] tomb thomas didn't have that opportunity
[17:23] and so he said well i won't believe
[17:26] until i can actually put my finger in
[17:29] the scar or put thrust my hand into his
[17:32] side and the lord was so gracious
[17:34] not to rebuke thomas but to say here
[17:38] here you go
[17:39] here's your opportunity thomas
[17:42] and then to say more blessed are those
[17:45] who have not seen and yet believe
[17:48] and and and we find that
[17:52] that that there are those uh who
[17:55] who upon hearing a testimony
[17:58] believe
[18:00] uh
[18:01] not as brother branham said just blindly
[18:03] but because and we're gonna we're gonna
[18:05] show examples of that tonight but
[18:07] because they were able to
[18:10] to put their trust
[18:13] into
[18:14] either the word of god or the testimony
[18:18] of somebody who knew god
[18:28] he mentioned
[18:31] i say he mentioned brother aaron
[18:32] mentioned
[18:34] philip going to nathanael
[18:37] and saying we've seen we've found the
[18:38] messiah
[18:40] and nathanael saying whoa
[18:44] jesus of nazareth and he said wait a
[18:46] second can any good thing come out of
[18:49] nazareth and philip just said look come
[18:52] see for yourself
[18:54] so when nathanael comes
[18:56] and jesus beholding him with the with
[18:59] that prophetic ministry able to to
[19:02] discern says to nathanael
[19:05] behold an israelite in whom there is no
[19:08] guile
[19:09] and nathanael just upon hearing that
[19:12] says thou art
[19:15] the son of god and and jesus asked him
[19:18] because i told you who you were
[19:21] you believe
[19:23] and his brother aaron said
[19:25] nathanael was saying yeah
[19:28] exactly just because of that gift
[19:33] you telling me who i am i do believe
[19:36] that you're the son of god and jesus
[19:38] said well you'll see greater things than
[19:40] this
[19:41] and and and it it causes my mind
[19:45] immediately to go to those to the prayer
[19:49] lines and to go to the things that you
[19:51] that you've heard so many times on tape
[19:54] that
[19:55] when when the discernment would would
[19:57] take place and uh somebody would come
[19:59] through the line and and and brother
[20:02] branham was able to just
[20:04] read their mail basically just read
[20:06] things into their lives that nobody
[20:08] could know
[20:10] and and time after time this would
[20:12] happen and
[20:13] and
[20:13] and then you could hear on so many tapes
[20:16] him saying
[20:18] um
[20:20] you know if if one of these signs was
[20:24] done
[20:25] in some of these other places overseas
[20:28] if just one of these
[20:30] multitudes of people would come upon
[20:33] just seeing
[20:34] one of these signs he says why is it
[20:38] that we as americans uh and here in the
[20:41] us and in in in these first world
[20:44] countries why is it that we have to see
[20:47] more and see more and see more
[20:50] and
[20:52] we we could probably dissect that and
[20:55] find out why it is that it takes
[20:59] more than one time more than one time
[21:01] but we do realize
[21:04] that
[21:05] for some of us it takes it just does it
[21:08] takes more
[21:10] like
[21:11] i'll say this
[21:14] there are a few skills that i've i've
[21:16] learned in my life i've been mastered by
[21:18] any means but i've learned
[21:22] and
[21:23] sometimes i feel so sheepish
[21:27] i i i used to work with my dad doing
[21:29] finnish carpentry
[21:32] and
[21:34] he was showing me when you're working
[21:36] with not paint grade but stain grade
[21:39] doors and base and casing and handrails
[21:42] um
[21:44] you've got to be pretty precise you
[21:46] can't just fill the gaps up with with
[21:48] caulking and and paint it it's it's got
[21:51] to be very precise
[21:54] and so he was
[21:55] desiring to show me how uh the tricks
[21:59] and the trade
[22:00] to how to do that how to to to make
[22:04] everything fit so nicely without without
[22:07] large gaps
[22:08] and many times he would show me and he
[22:10] would say you got it
[22:12] and i would say
[22:14] can you show me again
[22:16] he's like sure so he'd go through it
[22:18] again he cut a piece of wood we'd go
[22:20] through it he'd say all right you got it
[22:21] now
[22:24] can you show me again
[22:26] and there's been certain things
[22:29] that
[22:32] there's well i'll i'll i guess i'll you
[22:34] know confessions good for the soul
[22:36] there's been certain times people have
[22:38] have showed me several times and said
[22:40] you got it and i i was so embarrassed
[22:43] just to say no that i would just say
[22:45] sure yeah i got it
[22:47] and then they would leave and i would
[22:48] scratch my head and say i didn't get it
[22:50] you know i have no idea i i have no idea
[22:52] what i'm doing
[22:55] but then when i when you get it when i
[22:57] get it
[22:58] it was it was there it was nailed down
[23:01] and and from then on
[23:03] it was just off to the races and i could
[23:05] just do it like like i'd like i'd known
[23:07] how to do it all the time
[23:09] and god is so good to us
[23:12] to be long-suffering
[23:14] to say you got it
[23:17] lord i don't know i don't i all right
[23:20] that's all right we'll go through this
[23:21] again
[23:22] and and i love it how that
[23:25] as a 40 year old man i can sit down with
[23:28] my children
[23:29] and if they get excited about something
[23:32] they see in the bible
[23:35] they're probably i think so many times
[23:37] they look to me like dad you've probably
[23:39] known this forever
[23:43] but i'm so excited to say tonight that
[23:45] there's still things
[23:47] even last when last wednesday when
[23:50] brother aaron was showing a different
[23:52] way at looking at thomas as we would
[23:54] call him doubting thomas and saying no
[23:57] listen he still believed
[24:00] just like the others believed and i
[24:02] thought my i've never seen it like that
[24:05] before and i was so excited because i'm
[24:08] 40 years old and i saw something for the
[24:10] first time
[24:12] and so when we even as all this as as as
[24:15] you can get i don't think you it would
[24:18] matter how old you got
[24:19] when god shows you something and you get
[24:23] it it anchors down in your heart and you
[24:26] say lord i got it i got it thank you god
[24:29] for revelation that hits home and and
[24:32] revelation doesn't just just just move
[24:35] with the wind but it's anchored in the
[24:38] word
[24:39] oh my it's just tremendous and
[24:44] and so uh
[24:47] i
[24:51] i want to go through a couple
[24:53] characters in the bible and demonstrate
[24:56] especially to these young people
[24:59] demonstrate
[25:06] the faith
[25:08] that god gives to a believer
[25:12] that it is
[25:14] faith and it's good faith
[25:19] it's warranted faith
[25:21] and so
[25:25] i'd i'd like to start
[25:27] by just rehearsing this for you
[25:31] as we were going through our bible study
[25:35] we got into chapter 10
[25:39] and at verse 26 you come to this place
[25:43] where paul says
[25:45] if we sin willfully
[25:48] after that we've received the knowledge
[25:50] of the truth there remaineth no more
[25:52] sacrifice for sins
[25:55] you go whoa
[25:56] that's heavy
[25:59] i jump over to verse 29 of how much sore
[26:02] punishment suppose ye shall
[26:05] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[26:07] trodden underfoot the son of god and
[26:10] hath counted the blood of the covenant
[26:12] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[26:14] thing and hath done despite unto the
[26:17] spirit of grace
[26:24] man that's heavy
[26:26] and it is
[26:27] it's a very serious very serious subject
[26:31] but i jumped down and i i told these
[26:34] young men at the bible study i said you
[26:35] know so many times we jump over to
[26:38] hebrews 11
[26:39] and we say you know i just want to read
[26:41] about those the the heroes of faith i
[26:43] just want to read about the heroes of
[26:44] faith
[26:46] but if you would prelude it
[26:50] with chapter 10
[26:53] and you see this you say whoa who are
[26:55] these
[26:57] and paul i said look before you ever
[26:59] jump into chapter 11 and just start
[27:01] reading from verse 1 i said just imagine
[27:04] that that chapter 11 isn't there just
[27:07] imagine that that chapter 11 starts
[27:10] two verses higher
[27:12] and you start reading chapter 11
[27:15] actually chapter 10 verse 38
[27:18] now the just shall live by faith
[27:23] but if any man draw back
[27:25] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[27:29] but
[27:30] we are not of them who draw back unto
[27:35] perdition
[27:36] but of them that believe to the saving
[27:40] of the soul
[27:42] now faith is
[27:45] the substance of things hoped for the
[27:48] evidence of things not seen and goes on
[27:50] explain to us now
[27:52] what faith is
[27:54] he says now the just shall live by that
[27:57] faith
[28:00] and we're not of them
[28:02] that will draw back
[28:04] but we're of these
[28:06] in chapter 11.
[28:09] and when you
[28:10] when you can start the chapter like that
[28:13] then you're not looking at each of these
[28:15] characters as wow look at them but
[28:18] you're realizing paul's saying we
[28:21] are of them
[28:23] we
[28:24] are one of them and you say oh okay
[28:28] tell me more well
[28:32] i will tell you more let's go to one of
[28:34] those to to such a character and i'm
[28:37] turning over into joshua
[28:42] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[28:43] him in sincerity and in truth and put
[28:46] away the gods which your fathers served
[28:48] on the other side of the flood and in
[28:50] egypt and serve ye the lord
[28:53] and if it seems evil unto you to serve
[28:56] the lord choose you this day whom you
[29:00] will serve here we go here's that choice
[29:05] whether the gods which your father
[29:07] served that were on the other side of
[29:09] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[29:12] whose land he dwell but as for me and my
[29:15] house we will serve the lord now i don't
[29:18] believe that joshua at this point is
[29:20] saying now you all choose i'm going to
[29:22] turn my back
[29:24] but as for me now
[29:27] i'm gonna serve the lord
[29:29] and then he's looking back over his
[29:31] shoulder going
[29:32] what now what are you all gonna do now
[29:34] what are you what are you all gonna do
[29:36] i don't believe josh was doing that
[29:39] joshua's showing
[29:42] his faith where his faith is established
[29:46] and he's saying now you get the choice
[29:50] you get to choose
[29:52] whom you will serve
[29:54] now let's let's continue to read and the
[29:56] people answered and said god forbid that
[29:59] we should forsake the lord to serve
[30:02] other gods for the lord our god he it is
[30:05] that brought us up and our fathers out
[30:08] of the land of egypt from the house of
[30:11] bondage and which did those great signs
[30:14] in our sight and preserved us in all the
[30:17] way wherein we went and among all the
[30:20] people through whom we passed
[30:24] these people are saying we
[30:26] believe also in the same god you believe
[30:30] in
[30:31] because we have witnessed what he has
[30:34] done as well and that is what excited me
[30:37] so much about last week's service was we
[30:39] have something to base our faith on we
[30:42] have something to put our trust in
[30:45] because we have seen for ourselves what
[30:49] god has done for us
[31:00] now
[31:01] i i'm just going through these just a
[31:03] couple characters so that we can get
[31:05] through this
[31:07] i wanted to turn to a couple a couple of
[31:10] of the sisters in the bible so many
[31:13] times we read about you know we've
[31:14] already read about moses and we've
[31:16] already read about joshua and uh i like
[31:19] for for for the girls you know the
[31:21] little girls i got i've got girls
[31:24] i'd like for them to see that hey you
[31:26] know
[31:27] what about us
[31:28] what choices do we have to make in life
[31:31] well you've got some choices to make too
[31:34] and so let's look at a couple of those
[31:36] i'm turning over into the book of ruth
[31:38] for you young ladies that want to turn
[31:40] over into the book of ruth
[31:42] we're going to read from ruth chapter
[31:44] one
[31:51] and we're going to begin at verse 10
[31:54] and read on down to verse 17.
[31:56] and
[31:57] they said unto her this mrs
[32:00] ruth and orpah
[32:02] saying unto naomi
[32:04] surely
[32:05] we will return with thee unto thy people
[32:09] and naomi said
[32:10] turn again
[32:12] my daughters
[32:13] why
[32:14] will ye go with me
[32:17] are there yet any more sons in my womb
[32:20] that they may be your husbands
[32:23] turn again my daughters go your way
[32:26] for i'm too old to have a husband if i
[32:29] should say i have hope if i should say
[32:32] if if i should have a husband also
[32:34] tonight and should also hear hav or bear
[32:37] sons
[32:38] would you tarry for them till they were
[32:40] grown
[32:41] would ye stay for them
[32:44] from having husbands nay my daughters
[32:47] forgiveth me much
[32:50] for your sakes for it grieveth me much
[32:52] for your sakes that the hand of the lord
[32:55] is gone out against me
[32:57] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[33:00] again oh no doubt
[33:02] and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but
[33:05] ruth clave unto her and she said behold
[33:08] thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her
[33:11] people and unto her gods
[33:14] return thou
[33:15] after thy sister-in-law
[33:18] and ruth said entreat me not to leave
[33:21] thee
[33:22] or to return from following after thee
[33:26] for wither thou goest i will go
[33:29] and where thou largest i will lodge
[33:33] thy people shall be my people and thy
[33:36] god
[33:37] my god
[33:40] where thou diest will i die and there
[33:43] will i be buried the lord do so to me
[33:46] and more also if ought but death part
[33:50] thee and me
[33:52] here's a choice
[33:54] set before ruth
[33:56] and orpah
[34:02] you're going to stay with me your
[34:04] mother-in-law
[34:07] you notice the inflection i put there
[34:09] so many people they that's that's kind
[34:11] of how they always say their in-laws you
[34:14] know my father-in-law says you know the
[34:15] difference between in-laws and outlaws
[34:17] is outlaws are wanted and
[34:25] he says but you're not my in-laws you're
[34:27] not my sons-in-laws you're my son in
[34:29] grace and so i say oh thanks dad
[34:33] but
[34:34] here's
[34:35] their mother-in-law it's not even their
[34:37] own mother it's not even their own
[34:38] father it's their mother-in-law
[34:41] their mother-in-law says look he
[34:43] my husband's
[34:45] died my sons have died your husbands and
[34:49] you get
[34:50] listen i'm gonna make this easy for you
[34:53] i'll make the decision easy for you
[34:56] go back to your own family
[35:01] you enter into the same church you used
[35:03] to go to
[35:05] you go probably get
[35:07] go to the same people you grew up
[35:09] knowing and probably get a job
[35:11] a lot easier
[35:13] i don't make the just go it's okay
[35:16] i can't help you i got nothing to help
[35:18] you with
[35:20] and orpah says
[35:22] boy that sounds right you know i i'm
[35:25] gonna go but ruth
[35:28] ruth why did she choose naomi
[35:34] what was it
[35:35] that she would choose naomi
[35:37] over her own family they say well we
[35:39] don't know maybe she didn't have family
[35:40] and maybe
[35:42] but what i see here
[35:44] is that ruth saw something in naomi's
[35:48] life
[35:48] that was real
[35:51] ruth saw a testimony that naomi hill had
[35:55] believing in a god that that naomi
[35:59] made so real
[36:01] that i knew to be a real god that that
[36:04] knew to be the one true living god
[36:08] and
[36:09] and ruth saw this
[36:11] and ruth had confidence in naomi's
[36:14] testimony ruth had confidence in that
[36:17] because she'd seen with her own eyes
[36:20] she'd felt it the
[36:21] the the love and the embrace
[36:24] from from her own arms she had
[36:26] recognized
[36:28] that this that naomi believed was more
[36:31] than just a a hope so a a wish for type
[36:36] of life it was a real life
[36:40] and so her this faith she had in her
[36:43] mother-in-law
[36:45] carried her
[36:46] far enough to make a decision
[36:50] to let your people be my people
[36:53] let your god my god
[36:55] where you die that's wherever you live i
[36:58] want to live there that's where i want
[37:00] to live i want to be around you there's
[37:02] something different
[37:04] and and she even when she went with her
[37:07] mother-in-law then she's she's relying
[37:09] upon her mother-in-law's instruction
[37:12] what should i do and her mother-in-law
[37:14] says go away glean over in this field
[37:17] and and and and when you do and and and
[37:20] her perhaps her mother-in-law saw
[37:22] the
[37:23] the the the glimmer in boaz's eyes
[37:27] when he looked at ruth and and and he
[37:30] saw uh the the favor that he showed unto
[37:33] ruth and perhaps her mother-in-law
[37:35] caught that enough to give her wisdom
[37:38] enough to go on but when ruth
[37:40] experienced
[37:42] for herself
[37:46] who boaz was
[37:48] and and who this god was ruth uh
[37:51] embraced that
[37:53] on her own choice with her own decision
[37:58] and god carried her through
[38:01] all the way
[38:05] another character for you sisters
[38:09] is an esther
[38:12] and then esther
[38:13] chapter four
[38:17] again beginning at verse 10
[38:20] again esther
[38:22] spake unto hate act
[38:24] and gave him commandment unto mordechai
[38:29] this is her response to mordecai
[38:33] all the king's servants and the people
[38:36] of the king's provinces do know
[38:39] that whosoever whether man or woman
[38:42] shall come unto the king into the inner
[38:44] court who's not called
[38:47] there's one law of his to put him to
[38:49] death
[38:50] except
[38:52] such to whom the king shall hold out the
[38:54] golden scepter that he may live but i've
[38:57] not been called to come in unto the king
[39:00] these 30 days
[39:02] and they told to mordecai esther's words
[39:06] then mordecai commanded to answer esther
[39:11] think not
[39:13] with thyself that thou shalt escape in
[39:16] the king's house more
[39:18] than all the jews
[39:20] for if thou all together hold us thy
[39:22] peace at this time
[39:24] then shall their enlargement and
[39:27] deliverance arise to the jews from
[39:30] another place
[39:32] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[39:35] destroyed
[39:36] and who knoweth whether thou art come to
[39:39] the kingdom for such a time as this
[39:42] then esther paid them returned mordecai
[39:45] this answer
[39:47] go
[39:49] gather together all the jews that are
[39:51] present in shushen and fast ye for me
[39:54] and neither eat nor drink three days
[39:57] night or day
[39:59] i also and my maidens will fast likewise
[40:02] and so will i go in unto the king which
[40:05] is not according to the law
[40:08] and if i perish
[40:10] i perish
[40:14] now that's a choice to make
[40:17] there is set a crossroads before esther
[40:24] and now once again
[40:27] esther
[40:30] is relying
[40:32] upon
[40:34] the trust she's got in uncle mordecai
[40:39] she's relying that
[40:44] he's saying listen
[40:46] he's given her instructions thus far
[40:49] he's told her how to conduct herself
[40:51] thus far and she's made it into the into
[40:55] the palace thus far
[40:58] and uncle mordecai has always given her
[41:01] godly counsel
[41:04] uncle mordecai has has has given
[41:07] her her aid in such a way that she can
[41:10] trust uncle mordecai
[41:12] and uncle mordecai certainly is not
[41:15] uh
[41:17] taking any glory for who he is
[41:21] but uncle mordecai is sharing with
[41:24] esther
[41:26] what he believes
[41:29] who he believes in
[41:31] because uncle mordecai says listen
[41:35] here comes a decree
[41:37] and he gave her the decree that had
[41:39] already gone out the law that had been
[41:41] made
[41:42] and he said this is coming down
[41:46] and
[41:47] you've got to go into the king and
[41:49] discuss this
[41:51] you are a jew
[41:52] it affects you
[41:56] she's like i can't do that he says
[41:58] listen if you don't do it
[42:03] i believe
[42:05] in a god
[42:06] who's so big
[42:09] that
[42:11] he'll enlarge
[42:13] he'll be enlarged and he'll find another
[42:16] way
[42:17] to save the children of israel because i
[42:20] believe that god made a promise
[42:24] for these children for this group of
[42:26] people the seed of abraham i believe in
[42:30] a god who has shown himself to be
[42:33] faithful to these children time and time
[42:36] and time again and he'll do it again if
[42:40] he did it once he'll do it again and
[42:42] these are the words of mordecai this is
[42:44] the faith of mordecai
[42:46] now he says
[42:48] uh
[42:51] i don't know
[42:52] what's gonna happen to you esther
[42:57] that's reassuring
[43:01] you know i i i really don't know
[43:04] if you're going to die or not
[43:06] but who knows
[43:09] perhaps
[43:10] you were sent here for such a time as
[43:13] this
[43:21] well once again
[43:24] my thoughts are drawn to
[43:27] is esther asked to use blind faith
[43:32] blind trust in making this decision
[43:36] no
[43:37] esther
[43:38] begins drawing from a resource
[43:41] that's already there
[43:44] her trust
[43:46] that uncle mordecai
[43:48] knows a god
[43:50] and knows the word of god and has lived
[43:53] a life
[43:54] that
[43:55] has shown he believes that god is a
[43:58] deliverer
[44:00] and so
[44:01] esther is now
[44:04] relying upon this and saying he's never
[44:07] let me down before you go tell him
[44:11] to tell
[44:13] everybody you know that's a believer
[44:16] let's pray
[44:17] fast let's fast and let's pray let's
[44:20] approach god this is a serious matter
[44:29] i don't think that i have to
[44:32] draw a whole lot from you
[44:36] to
[44:37] make you think do you know about serious
[44:39] matters like this i believe
[44:42] we each understand matters like this
[44:46] they're very serious
[44:49] now
[44:51] i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
[44:53] continue to read through but
[44:55] we know
[44:56] the end of this story
[44:59] that esther
[45:01] goes
[45:02] before the king
[45:06] and she recognizes
[45:09] that
[45:11] she's not just
[45:14] somebody just anybody
[45:17] but that she's found favor
[45:20] with the king
[45:22] that the king isn't just acknowledging
[45:25] her
[45:26] as
[45:28] some
[45:30] some lady in the kingdom or or some
[45:32] servant
[45:34] but she finds out
[45:38] that he loves her
[45:43] that it's
[45:44] it's not a matter of laws it's not a
[45:47] matter of
[45:48] of
[45:49] uh
[45:51] an audience with the king it's a
[45:54] it's about a relationship
[45:57] she discovers
[46:01] that
[46:03] he loves her
[46:05] so much
[46:07] that he tells her
[46:09] i'll give you
[46:12] it's all yours he says up to half i
[46:14] think i'll give up to half the kingdom
[46:17] you just say the word
[46:19] and when esther's trust
[46:22] and esther experiences for herself
[46:26] not mordecai mordecai he wasn't there
[46:29] for that part mordecai didn't get to
[46:32] experience the relationship esther got
[46:35] to experience with the king this was
[46:38] between esther and the king
[46:40] and she discovered
[46:42] that
[46:43] this king
[46:45] not only just found favor but he loved
[46:48] her
[46:49] he loved her he desired for her to be
[46:52] his wife to share in all of his glory to
[46:56] share in all of his secrets to share in
[46:58] all of these things and when she
[47:00] discovered that that it wasn't about
[47:03] just this he's the king and i'm
[47:05] subservient to him but that that's he
[47:08] wants me to be his wife
[47:10] he wants me to to sit and to rule and to
[47:13] reign with him when she discovered this
[47:16] is about more it's about a relationship
[47:19] her trust was anchored and she was able
[47:23] then to say i
[47:25] i'd like to set a dinner how about that
[47:29] now esther's trust and her faith begins
[47:32] to build in in her position and her uh
[47:37] relationship with the king so much so
[47:40] that he says what would you like to do
[47:42] dear and she says well
[47:44] i'll tell you what i like to do let's
[47:46] have ourselves a dinner huh and how
[47:48] about you bring el haymon along with
[47:52] with in in absolutely anybody you'd like
[47:54] bring them along
[47:57] esther now begins to set the stage
[48:01] to make things right
[48:05] to bring about
[48:07] the
[48:08] uh
[48:10] hidden
[48:11] ill motives that have been
[48:14] set out there
[48:15] and oh my
[48:17] that just makes my heart
[48:19] just swell in size
[48:22] that our faith is not just in a distant
[48:25] god it's not just in a well he's god and
[48:29] and i'm i'm i'm a i'm just a human down
[48:31] here just trying to
[48:34] you know to pull my pull my weight you
[48:36] know to stack the blocks for this you
[48:39] know this great thing that's happening
[48:41] but when you discovered for yourself
[48:44] that he loved you
[48:47] that all
[48:49] the plan of redemption
[48:52] was about a relationship
[48:55] was about a marriage
[48:57] was about a family
[48:59] and you begin to discover that you're
[49:02] not just an orphan
[49:05] the devil would like to pull that one
[49:07] right over your eyes that you're not
[49:09] just
[49:10] some uh
[49:13] washer girl that's got to be in the back
[49:16] while the other ones are dancing so
[49:18] frolicking around with beautiful dress
[49:20] and that you're just there you're just
[49:22] the downtrodden cousin
[49:25] but no
[49:26] he loves you
[49:28] he desires to marry
[49:30] you
[49:32] and
[49:34] and it doesn't it doesn't cause the
[49:36] believer
[49:37] to rise up
[49:39] and say well then
[49:42] you know
[49:43] let my voice be heard oh no quite the
[49:46] contrary you say oh lord why me
[49:49] why me
[49:51] but your confidence begins to build your
[49:54] trust in god begins to build in that
[49:57] relationship and that faith then is no
[50:00] longer blind faith but it's a faith in
[50:03] an experience you've had that he's been
[50:06] faithful he's been faithful he's been
[50:08] faithful
[50:16] oh my
[50:21] i'm going back to hebrews chapter 11.
[50:29] and we see that
[50:31] this first verse chapter
[50:33] or verse 23 in chapter 11 says by faith
[50:37] moses when he was born was hid three
[50:40] months of his parents
[50:41] we find this was the faith of his
[50:43] parents
[50:49] they believed
[50:51] that god had given them a proper child
[50:54] that this child
[50:58] was different that god was going to use
[51:00] this child and their faith
[51:03] caused them to go into action
[51:06] and to hide moses during these three
[51:09] months
[51:10] and we realized that
[51:15] as moses was carried into the palace and
[51:18] raised by pharaoh's daughter
[51:20] that god so ordained things that his own
[51:24] mother
[51:25] got to be his wet nurse
[51:28] she got to raise her own child and get
[51:31] paid for it
[51:32] in the palace
[51:37] and through the stories and
[51:40] and and and
[51:42] and i guess by faith
[51:44] we can we get to
[51:47] envision
[51:51] moses's mother jockbed telling moses
[51:55] about
[51:56] her god
[51:58] telling moses
[51:59] about
[52:00] his people
[52:02] telling moses the stories
[52:04] that
[52:05] uh were from the beginning
[52:07] perhaps the creation and
[52:10] and the promise of the woman's seed and
[52:12] the messiah to come and and all of the
[52:15] promises of god that were given to
[52:18] abraham and to isaac to joseph and and
[52:21] and and
[52:23] oh how she must have you know even
[52:26] sharing with moses we're in the land of
[52:28] egypt and and here's the reason why
[52:30] we're in the land of egypt and let me
[52:32] tell you about joseph and how that god
[52:34] preserved him and and set him up in a
[52:38] place and and sharing these things in
[52:40] order to raise her child now imagine
[52:43] she's just a wet nurse
[52:46] and so this relationship that she gets
[52:49] to have in the palace with her own son
[52:52] goes for how long
[52:54] i i would say maybe
[52:56] maybe we could be generous and say 10 12
[52:59] years old before she's let go
[53:02] you're not needed anymore as a wet nurse
[53:08] but she's instilled these things into
[53:11] moses these stories this sunday school
[53:16] for the kids
[53:20] not just for fun not just for the candy
[53:25] but for life
[53:26] for life
[53:28] lessons that are going to come
[53:30] away come across his way
[53:33] but now
[53:35] she's done as a wet nurse and now moses
[53:39] is turned over into the hands of the
[53:41] egyptian teachers
[53:43] now moses is turned over into the hands
[53:46] of the egyptian priests
[53:49] now he's turned over into the hands of
[53:51] the egyptian commanders
[53:54] moses is now being trained
[53:56] under egyptian training during
[54:00] this
[54:03] first transition
[54:05] from adolescence to adult life
[54:09] a very
[54:13] serious time in a child's life
[54:22] and we don't get all of the description
[54:24] between verse 23
[54:26] and verse 24.
[54:28] we don't get that whole drama that
[54:30] unfolded in those years but what we do
[54:34] understand
[54:35] is that by faith moses
[54:40] when he was come to years refused to be
[54:43] called the son of pharaoh's daughter
[54:45] choosing rather to suffer the affliction
[54:48] with the people of god than to enjoy the
[54:50] pleasures pleasures of sin for a season
[54:53] is steaming that reproach of christ
[54:55] great greater riches than all those of
[54:57] egypt
[54:58] brother branham says that one day moses
[55:00] was looking walking by a window and he
[55:03] looked out the window and he saw the
[55:07] hebrew children
[55:09] making bricks
[55:11] mud daubers
[55:13] and something in his heart
[55:17] said
[55:18] those are my people
[55:22] i'm a part of that
[55:26] and was it moses's own choosing or was
[55:30] there a foundation that had been built
[55:34] by his mother when he was young that
[55:37] even when he was in the hands of the
[55:39] egyptian priests even though he was in
[55:41] the hands of the scholars of egypt even
[55:44] when he was in the hands of all the the
[55:47] commanders of egypt who promised moses
[55:49] might and power and popularity and
[55:52] strength and all of that still there was
[55:55] something in moses a representation
[55:58] that god had put within moses that when
[56:02] those when he could look out the window
[56:05] us
[56:06] his mother's words could come back into
[56:09] his mind and he could see
[56:11] something that was real a people that
[56:14] were willing to even
[56:16] forsake uh riches forsake the the great
[56:21] things of god that were willing to die
[56:23] that were willing to live a life of
[56:25] slavery and yet
[56:27] serve a god that was real
[56:39] now
[56:45] the long story is right
[56:48] that that faith carried moses far enough
[56:51] to kill one egyptian
[56:55] and then out of fear he flees
[57:00] and even when he's standing before god
[57:04] before that pillar of fire he says lord
[57:07] and god says i'm going to send you
[57:10] moses but i'll go before you but i'm
[57:13] sending you
[57:15] to go to egypt to pharaoh
[57:19] and and
[57:22] moses says
[57:24] i can't talk
[57:29] i don't have the ability
[57:31] to talk but moses says
[57:34] god says to moses
[57:36] you know bring aaron you know he'll talk
[57:39] for you but i'm the one who will go
[57:41] before you moses
[57:45] moses now had received an experience in
[57:48] the presence of god
[57:51] as you hear so many times on tape
[57:54] not
[57:55] to kill
[57:56] one egyptian
[57:57] but to go
[57:59] and
[58:00] before a whole nation
[58:06] not in fear anymore
[58:09] not in hopes so anymore
[58:11] now with an assurance that he met
[58:15] the god
[58:17] who created all heavens and all earth
[58:20] the god who is so mighty that he could
[58:22] open up the red sea moses now met that
[58:24] god and by that experience now moses's
[58:28] faith is based on something to do more
[58:31] than just slay one egyptian
[58:35] oh my
[58:42] and i i printed up these quotes and i'm
[58:45] not gonna read them all
[58:48] but they're on free moral agency
[58:53] and there's a couple places where
[58:55] brother branham says that
[58:57] that god put us on equal terms with him
[59:01] by giving us free moral agency
[59:05] you think wow that's a
[59:07] that's a tremendous thought
[59:09] that god himself acts upon free moral
[59:12] agency
[59:17] and god
[59:18] through foreknowledge
[59:23] and desiring to put you on equal basis
[59:26] to put mankind on equal basis gives them
[59:29] free moral agency
[59:33] and he says even knowing
[59:36] that when he gave adam and eve free
[59:38] moral agency they would choose wrong
[59:43] that their choice would be the wrong
[59:45] choice
[59:48] and him knowing that
[59:54] by foreknowledge
[59:56] he set the motions of the plan of
[59:58] redemption into place
[1:00:02] because he desired he desired to put to
[1:00:06] bring forth the attributes of a savior
[1:00:09] to bring forth the attributes of a
[1:00:11] healer to being bring forth the
[1:00:13] attributes of a father
[1:00:18] it's
[1:00:20] so many times we
[1:00:23] the prophet of god just
[1:00:25] continually brings out that
[1:00:27] on our own with our on our own choice
[1:00:30] just as as men and women as carnal
[1:00:33] men and women born into the sin into
[1:00:35] this world in sin
[1:00:37] the choices we make
[1:00:40] eventually lead us
[1:00:43] to the wrong
[1:00:45] they're the wrong choices
[1:00:59] and even with good intentions even
[1:01:01] though those
[1:01:03] that have got the best intentions
[1:01:10] out of our own capacity out of our own
[1:01:12] mental capacity our own
[1:01:16] desires
[1:01:17] eventually
[1:01:19] we go astray
[1:01:22] we choose
[1:01:24] the wrong way
[1:01:27] we'll choose the easy way
[1:01:46] and i want to close with this thought
[1:01:55] in galatians chapter 4
[1:01:59] verse 6 it says this
[1:02:07] let's start up higher
[1:02:16] let's just read
[1:02:18] from verse 1 down to verse 6. now i say
[1:02:20] that the heir as long as he is a child
[1:02:23] differeth nothing from a servant though
[1:02:24] he be lord of all but as under tutors
[1:02:27] and governors until the time appointed
[1:02:29] of the father even so we when we were
[1:02:31] children were in bondage under the
[1:02:34] elements of the world
[1:02:37] but when the fullness of the time was
[1:02:39] come god sent forth his son made of a
[1:02:42] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:02:45] that were under the law that we might
[1:02:48] receive the adoption of sons
[1:02:51] and because
[1:02:52] ye are sons and daughters
[1:02:56] god hath sent forth the spirit of his
[1:02:59] son
[1:03:00] into your hearts
[1:03:02] crying
[1:03:03] abba father
[1:03:13] god
[1:03:20] god is so good to us
[1:03:23] to speak of the goodness of god
[1:03:26] we couldn't we would exhaust
[1:03:29] every service doing that but
[1:03:31] to see that
[1:03:34] you
[1:03:35] god knowing you were a son of god
[1:03:38] god knowing that moses was his son god
[1:03:41] knowing that joshua was his son and the
[1:03:44] children would believe
[1:03:46] uh caleb and joshua god knowing that
[1:03:48] ruth was his daughter god knowing that
[1:03:51] esther was his
[1:03:52] god knowing that
[1:03:54] that those were his sons that was his
[1:03:56] daughters
[1:03:59] but
[1:04:00] he wouldn't be just unless he gave them
[1:04:03] free moral agency to choose for
[1:04:05] themselves
[1:04:08] and his brother aaron was expressing
[1:04:10] they it wasn't just throwing a dart in
[1:04:13] the dark
[1:04:15] it wasn't just faith based on
[1:04:18] on hope so
[1:04:24] god knowing that you were a son and
[1:04:27] daughter of god
[1:04:32] and that so many times your own choices
[1:04:34] let you down they just they continue to
[1:04:36] let you down but god loving us so much
[1:04:39] he sent his spirit
[1:04:42] so that
[1:04:45] so that he could help you make the
[1:04:47] decision not that he would make the
[1:04:50] decision for you
[1:04:51] but that he himself
[1:04:54] would live inside you so that you could
[1:04:57] have trust in his decision so that you
[1:05:00] could have trust and faith in god in the
[1:05:03] very life of god that you could have the
[1:05:06] same experiences that the disciples had
[1:05:09] that that that thomas had not that you
[1:05:12] would have to physically see him but
[1:05:14] that you could know him
[1:05:17] that you could know him and that you
[1:05:20] could put trust
[1:05:22] that this same jesus christ that you
[1:05:25] read about you didn't get to see him you
[1:05:28] didn't get to even though you say that's
[1:05:30] what i would have needed to i would have
[1:05:33] needed to touch him i would have needed
[1:05:35] to to feel the scars maybe i would have
[1:05:37] needed that maybe i would you could call
[1:05:40] me thomas
[1:05:42] but god knowing that god
[1:05:44] uh he gave you some the best thing he
[1:05:47] could give you
[1:05:48] that was the very life that was in jesus
[1:05:51] christ
[1:05:53] to guide your decision to help you make
[1:05:56] that decision
[1:05:58] based upon
[1:06:01] something you've got can have faith in
[1:06:04] that's his eternal word
[1:06:11] and
[1:06:13] it just thrills my heart
[1:06:16] to look into this bible
[1:06:19] and to see that
[1:06:22] there's
[1:06:23] testimony after testimony after
[1:06:26] testimony of those who made
[1:06:30] life-changing decisions
[1:06:33] decisions that were enormous not only
[1:06:36] for themselves but for people around
[1:06:39] them
[1:06:43] it wasn't
[1:06:44] it wasn't blind it wasn't blind trust
[1:06:48] god gave
[1:06:50] he he gave example after example
[1:06:53] opportunity after opportunity
[1:06:56] that we could put our trust
[1:07:00] in these
[1:07:02] in these examples
[1:07:03] in in the word of god back here in the
[1:07:06] word of god back here back here all the
[1:07:08] way to our very own day to where we
[1:07:11] could see one another the testimony that
[1:07:14] each one of us has and say if god could
[1:07:17] do it for him if god could do it for her
[1:07:21] god you're still the same i believe that
[1:07:24] and i could have faith
[1:07:26] that you'll do the same
[1:07:28] god bless you this evening
[1:07:30] let's stand together
[1:07:35] oh take courage church
[1:07:40] we're not of them that draw back
[1:07:43] our heart has no pleasure in drawing
[1:07:46] back
[1:07:47] but
[1:07:48] but the just shall live by faith
[1:07:52] that's what we live by
[1:07:54] is the faith this mysterious faith
[1:07:58] as his brother aaron read
[1:08:02] amen
[1:08:04] i have decided to follow jesus
