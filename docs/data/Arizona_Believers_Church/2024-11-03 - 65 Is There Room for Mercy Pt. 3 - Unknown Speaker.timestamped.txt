[0:00] as we're continuing on this our subject
[0:02] this year on the house of the Lord I'd
[0:03] like to take another part on asking this
[0:06] question is there room for mercy and I
[0:09] am drawing from the the idea of a house
[0:13] uh with rooms and a house with space and
[0:15] a place a dwelling place and asking is
[0:18] there room for mercy and as I've studied
[0:21] Mercy over the last uh little while I've
[0:24] been wanting to take a fresh look at it
[0:26] and so I've been trying to find as many
[0:29] uh connections to Mercy in the scripture
[0:31] just to find how the Bible uh teaches
[0:33] mercy and how it's applicable in many
[0:35] different ways and I'm finding that the
[0:37] meaning uh is dependent upon many
[0:39] different context and there's actually a
[0:41] word that I found in um the Old
[0:44] Testament that is only ever used of God
[0:47] about compassion and mercy except maybe
[0:49] possibly in one instance and so Mercy is
[0:52] sometimes uh there's a way that it's
[0:53] Express that it can only be God and
[0:56] there's Mercy that we can have ourselves
[0:58] and so there's a lot of different a and
[1:00] looking at Mercy and I think it's just a
[1:01] beautiful subject to study and just to
[1:04] tie into some of the things we've been
[1:06] ministering lately in John chapter
[1:08] 14:12 Jesus says verily verily I say
[1:11] unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:13] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:16] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:18] because I go unto my father The Works
[1:21] that I do shall he do also this is for
[1:24] those that believe even Paul is is
[1:26] instructing Titus is saying those that
[1:29] believe they should should uh be in mind
[1:31] to cultivate and to be faithful to
[1:34] maintain good works and Jesus says those
[1:37] that believe the works that he did shall
[1:39] we do also and this is uh something that
[1:43] all of us should challenge ourselves by
[1:44] that if the Life of Christ is inside of
[1:47] me then the same life that worked in him
[1:50] will work in me and we could challenge
[1:53] ourselves and say well does that mean I
[1:54] need to turn water to wine or walk on
[1:56] water and these things and you'll find
[1:58] that you don't need to do those things
[2:00] do I need to die upon the cross no you
[2:02] don't need to do that but there's a work
[2:04] that he did there's certain uh things
[2:07] that defined his life certain
[2:08] characteristics that stood out and there
[2:11] are works that we are to do that he did
[2:13] and there are Greater Works that we are
[2:15] to do in this end time and there's a
[2:16] work to be finished and as we have
[2:19] mentioned recently and brother brandham
[2:21] and he's ministering is this the sign of
[2:23] the end he's talking about different
[2:25] mysteries in the Bible that are uh there
[2:27] for the believer to understand and to be
[2:29] revealed he says the mystery of the
[2:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[2:34] sensation now we know there's a lot of
[2:36] teaching on that in the message of the
[2:37] hour in terms of uh what these
[2:39] Sensations might be or evidences and
[2:42] physical ways that people want to be
[2:43] able to put their finger on it and say I
[2:45] had this happen so I know that I've got
[2:47] the Holy Ghost but he's saying that it
[2:49] is the mystery of the Seal of God this
[2:51] mystery of the new birth that isn't
[2:53] evidenced by some emotion or sensation
[2:56] he says but the person of Christ
[2:58] performing in you the same work that he
[3:00] did so you can say without sensation but
[3:03] doing it the way he did it uh living the
[3:06] life the way that he lived doing it just
[3:08] the way that he does it so the evidence
[3:10] of Christ in a person's heart is
[3:13] performing his Works in fulfillment of
[3:15] his word the promised word that he has
[3:18] given us and to do his will or to do his
[3:22] works we have to do it in the same
[3:23] nature we have to do it in the same
[3:25] character of the word not just an IM a
[3:28] False Image as we were dealing with it
[3:30] on Wednesday night if the Bible says to
[3:32] to um the rod will drive away
[3:35] Disobedience and stubbornness and and it
[3:37] speaks of uh this physical or Corporal
[3:40] spanking that one might do to their
[3:42] child and and it says do it early uh we
[3:44] don't want to just have spank children
[3:47] we don't want to just spank them say
[3:48] well there's the word the word's being
[3:50] fulfilled but that could be a False
[3:51] Image because you haven't really
[3:53] accomplished what that's supposed to do
[3:56] so it's not done in the nature of the
[3:57] word so it's not just letter but it's
[3:59] also Al in the character and nature of
[4:01] it when we read it says the works that I
[4:04] do shall he do also a word there is an
[4:07] act or deed or the thing done so these
[4:10] works or acts of Christ I've been
[4:12] thinking about how we say the acts of
[4:14] the holy spirit in the apostles and in
[4:17] the early church it was the works of the
[4:19] Holy Ghost in the lives of the
[4:21] Christians there in the beginning and so
[4:24] you have the works or the acts of Christ
[4:26] in ourselves it is the thing done it is
[4:28] the results it's what's produced those
[4:31] are the works those are the acts of
[4:33] Christ and what I'm wanting to focus on
[4:38] is Mercy as an attribute of Christ an
[4:41] essential characteristic of how he works
[4:44] and I acknowledge that this is a very
[4:46] narrow focus is so the works that I do
[4:48] shall he do also and all a sudden say is
[4:49] there room for mercy and zero in on this
[4:52] idea of Mercy but I do want to look at
[4:55] Mercy and its character it's even
[4:57] controversy its convenience and how that
[5:00] God has uh at God's heart is Mercy and
[5:05] that God is rich in Mercy and there's a
[5:07] lot of scriptures that you can begin to
[5:09] think about and so I want to look at
[5:11] Mercy and understand it's got to be part
[5:13] of these works these end time works that
[5:15] we're doing as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[5:18] and there are misunderstandings or even
[5:21] some
[5:22] wrestlingscout the place of Mercy today
[5:26] uh but I will say this uh just so that
[5:28] you're you're thinking in this way that
[5:30] The Mercy Seat has always been moving
[5:33] there's always been movement to Where
[5:35] Mercy is we know that in the house of
[5:37] the Lord they there was a room the most
[5:40] holy place the holiest of holies that
[5:42] was dedicated to Mercy and truth and
[5:45] mercy was found there that pritu that
[5:48] Mercy Seat between the cherums that that
[5:51] covering of the Ark and that's where God
[5:53] would dwell that's where the shikina
[5:54] glory would dwell and it move it was
[5:57] there in the Tabernacle in the
[5:58] wilderness in the beginning there The
[6:00] Exodus when God established this and
[6:02] then it moved from the Tabernacle in the
[6:04] wilderness to the temple in Jerusalem
[6:07] and there it was for some time but then
[6:09] it moved from the temple to the cross
[6:11] and it moved from the cross to heaven
[6:14] and so there
[6:16] is I can even say into the temple or the
[6:19] sanctuary in heaven and so Mercy has
[6:21] always been something that moved there's
[6:24] always been something available a mercy
[6:25] available God has always been merciful
[6:28] the Bible says his Mercy endures forever
[6:30] and one of the most common phrases in
[6:32] the Old Testament and so I I want us to
[6:34] all do it personally individually and
[6:37] even now as we Minister on this to
[6:39] deeply consider mercy and this morning
[6:42] as the Lord dealt with my heart last
[6:44] week and just kind of arrived at this
[6:46] place where didn't know that I'd really
[6:48] get into this this way but I want us to
[6:50] especially think about Mercy in light of
[6:52] the time that we're living in right now
[6:55] in the day and age that we're living in
[6:56] this time of judgment and so today my
[6:59] focus is going to be on scriptures that
[7:02] are being fulfilled in this end time in
[7:04] this aspect of judgment in this time
[7:06] that we're living in so if you take your
[7:08] Bibles to Luke Chapter
[7:10] 17:
[7:15] 26-3 I believe that we could maybe all
[7:17] read this without the the help or the
[7:20] aid of of the Bible just it's such a
[7:23] familiar scripture and as it was in the
[7:25] days of Noah so shall it be also in the
[7:27] days of the son of man
[7:30] and he says they did eat they drank they
[7:32] married wives they were given in
[7:34] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[7:36] into the ark and the flood came and
[7:39] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[7:41] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[7:43] drank they bought they sold they planted
[7:45] they builded but the same day that lot
[7:48] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[7:50] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[7:52] all and it says even thus shall it be in
[7:55] the day when the son of man is revealed
[7:59] now there's a lot in these statements
[8:01] there's actually a lot in these
[8:02] statements and a lot maybe hid by these
[8:04] statements because when we read in
[8:06] verses 27 and even verse 28 that there's
[8:09] a lot of details that just relate to
[8:11] Everyday Life As far as eating and
[8:13] drinking and marrying and the buying and
[8:15] selling the planting and building but
[8:17] yet in all of this there was something
[8:20] that displeased God and and God is
[8:22] saying that in the days of Noah and the
[8:24] days of lot when they did these things
[8:26] and so it identifies the nature and
[8:28] characteristic of the people on the
[8:30] surface but then it says the day that
[8:32] Noah entered the Ark the flood came and
[8:34] destroyed them all and so it kind of
[8:36] sets up the scene in the the signs of
[8:38] the time as it were and then it says the
[8:40] same thing in the days of lot it says
[8:42] but the day that lot went out of Sodom
[8:44] it rainf fire bstone from heaven and
[8:46] destroyed them all in both instances it
[8:48] says it destroyed them all not Noah not
[8:51] lot but it destroyed all those that
[8:54] tasted that judgment that felt that
[8:56] wrath of God and so the says even thus
[9:00] shall it be in the day when the son of
[9:02] man is revealed so the revelation of the
[9:04] son of man kind of opens up this time or
[9:06] this dispensation of judgment that when
[9:09] the son of man is revealed what Jesus is
[9:11] saying when the son of man is revealed
[9:13] that uh there is a flood came and
[9:15] destroyed them all when the son the the
[9:17] son of man is going to be re as it was
[9:19] in the days of Noah the flood came and
[9:20] destroyed them all as it was in the days
[9:22] of lot fire and brimstone for It Out of
[9:24] Heaven onto Sodom gomor and those cities
[9:26] in the plain and destroy the mountain he
[9:27] says this is going to be an aspect or
[9:30] characteristic of the revealing of the
[9:32] son of man in Matthew CH 24: 36 I would
[9:36] just read to verse 39 but of that day
[9:38] and hour knoweth no man know not the
[9:40] angels of heaven but my father only but
[9:43] as the days of Noah were so shall also
[9:46] be so shall also the coming of the son
[9:49] of man be for as in the days that were
[9:51] before the flood they were eating and
[9:53] drinking and marrying and giving in
[9:54] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[9:56] into the ark and knew not till the flood
[10:00] came and took them all away so shall
[10:02] also the coming of the son of man be
[10:06] this coming of the son of man is you
[10:08] could could have been translate to
[10:09] Advent it's used of the Christmas time
[10:11] the Advent of Christ but it means his
[10:13] arrival and his continued presence with
[10:16] so when it says the coming of the son of
[10:17] man it's not just like Boom come and go
[10:19] but it's him arriving him coming and
[10:22] this coming is we've already seen in
[10:24] Luke chapter 17 it's the revealing of
[10:26] the son of man scripturally the
[10:27] revealing of the son of man is the the
[10:29] same as the coming of the son of man in
[10:31] this particular instance it's not that
[10:33] you'd find everywhere where it uses
[10:35] coming and everywhere it uses reveal it
[10:37] and say it's all the same event but here
[10:39] as Christ says as it was in the day of
[10:40] Noah so shall it be in the revealing of
[10:43] the son of man and then it says in matth
[10:45] 24 this way so shall it be in the coming
[10:47] of the son of man so the age of the son
[10:50] of man is a time of judgment as it said
[10:53] that the flood came and took them all
[10:55] away the fire and brimstone came and
[10:57] destroyed them all right so the son of
[11:00] man this ministry of the son of man has
[11:02] this aspect of judgment John 5: 27 and
[11:06] hath given him authority to execute
[11:09] judgment also because he is the son of
[11:12] man because he is the son of man he has
[11:15] this given to him this authority to
[11:18] execute judgment so it's essential to
[11:21] his character it's part of this
[11:23] manifestation of this revealing to
[11:25] execute judgment as the son of man says
[11:28] this Matthew 16: 27 and 28 for the son
[11:32] of man shall come in the glory of his
[11:34] father with his angels and then he shall
[11:36] reward every man according to his works
[11:39] so here is a reward a judgment a
[11:41] dispensing as the son of man verily I
[11:44] say unto you there be some standing here
[11:46] which shall not taste of death till they
[11:48] see the son of man coming in his kingdom
[11:51] and we see in Matthew 17 Mark chapter9
[11:53] the Transfiguration this rehearsal this
[11:56] preview of The Kingdom coming in power
[11:58] and it's the the son and hear ye him and
[12:00] hear ye him alone it's this glory and
[12:03] power of the Kingdom to whom judgment is
[12:07] committed to Christ the son of man so
[12:10] the son of man is an a a a judgment
[12:13] office it is a judge it has this aspect
[12:15] of a judge and this is the age of the
[12:17] son of man being revealed we must
[12:20] understand these things that are taught
[12:23] and if this is the age of the son of man
[12:25] being revealed and it is given to the
[12:27] son of man to execute judgment
[12:29] and the revealing of the son of man
[12:31] enters in a time in dispensation of
[12:34] judgment we say oh judgment well not
[12:36] white Throne judgment a a and not
[12:39] tribulation judgment but it's a time of
[12:42] judgment that will flow out into these
[12:45] other periods of tribulation and even
[12:46] all the way to White Throne judgment
[12:48] we've entered a time when the son of man
[12:51] is revealed he comes and there's going
[12:53] to be judgment upon it says them all and
[12:57] I would say that in the face of judgment
[12:59] Mercy becomes a pretty important subject
[13:02] that if it's a time of judgment I'd want
[13:05] to know well if you were going to be in
[13:07] court and you're going to be facing a
[13:08] judge or a judge was going to be
[13:09] presiding over your case you might want
[13:11] to know a little bit about the process
[13:13] you want might want to know a little bit
[13:14] about what's available to says well
[13:16] you're being sued uh for $25 million and
[13:20] and you've got to answer in court and
[13:22] this is going to be the judge and you
[13:23] might say well what are my remedies what
[13:25] are my recourses what's the possible
[13:27] outcome oh well there's no other outcome
[13:28] but judgment against you in $25 million
[13:31] you're like well guess there's not much
[13:32] I can do about it don't need to worry
[13:34] about answering don't we need to worry
[13:35] about showing up it's already been
[13:37] decided this is what the rule of law
[13:39] says this is who's presiding this is
[13:40] going to be the outcome especially I
[13:42] guess if you're facing a criminal trial
[13:44] you've been charged uh with this crime
[13:46] and you're going to have to face the
[13:47] judge and he's a really tough one he's
[13:49] really hard on crime and said well can I
[13:51] plead not guilty well no I mean it
[13:54] doesn't matter can I throw myself at the
[13:56] mercy of the Court no there's no such
[13:57] thing you'd want to know the process
[13:59] you'd want to know the rules the
[14:01] possible outcom what are the sentencing
[14:02] guidelines what what can I do and so I
[14:05] believe in light of the scriptural
[14:06] things that we see here in Luke chapter
[14:08] 17 in Matthew 24 and6 these different
[14:11] places that Mercy is a critical subject
[14:15] and I would say this is why Satan tries
[14:17] to confuse it so much is that if it is a
[14:20] judgment time Satan would sure want us
[14:22] to confuse what judgment is what it
[14:24] looks like how it's going to come to
[14:25] pass and he' want to confuse us on this
[14:28] aspect of Mercy mercy and I believe that
[14:30] it must not be
[14:32] misunderstood we must not misunderstand
[14:35] mercy and if I could say it this way
[14:36] when I'm asking if there's room for
[14:38] Mercy I'm asking if there's room for
[14:40] mercy in your
[14:41] heart I'm asking if there's room for
[14:43] mercy in your family I'm asking if
[14:44] there's room for Mercy at a church
[14:46] because there's a way that we can carry
[14:47] ourselves with this little bit of
[14:49] self-righteousness a little bit of a
[14:51] judgment and some really costic
[14:54] attitudes that betray the real mercy of
[14:57] Christ that betray the real Heart Of God
[14:59] so it's a challenge to us that about
[15:02] mercy and you'll find in the scripture
[15:04] if you look at it that if we believe
[15:06] that we have been recipients of
[15:09] Mercy then we ought to be
[15:11] merciful a and not be so quick to say
[15:14] well God I'm justified in the sight of
[15:16] God as if I never did it in the first
[15:18] place and you're going straight to
[15:21] hell this is something that we must not
[15:25] misunderstand in the days of Noah if you
[15:27] could just walk with me in this I really
[15:29] want to substantiate this through
[15:31] scripture Jesus says Noah entered the
[15:33] Ark and as Noah enters the ark it says
[15:36] that God destroyed the rest Genesis 6:13
[15:41] God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh
[15:43] is come before me for the Earth is
[15:45] filled with violence through them and
[15:47] behold I will destroy them with the
[15:50] Earth quite a statement as God looked
[15:52] down upon the Earth and he said their
[15:53] imagination of man is only evil
[15:55] continually they do great wickedness and
[15:59] the end of Flesh has come before me I
[16:01] want to destroy them
[16:03] all and God having made this
[16:05] pronouncement in chapter 7 verses 15 to
[16:07] 23 and it says and they went in and we
[16:09] know God commanded Noah to build the ark
[16:11] and it's not just over a few weeks but
[16:13] in those 120 years we know there was a
[16:15] lot of laboring with this gospel with
[16:18] this message and this testimony that uh
[16:21] you're going to need a big boat is what
[16:24] his life was testifying his life was
[16:26] testifying judgment is coming judgment
[16:28] is coming com me and it says Noah went
[16:31] into in unto and they went in unto Noah
[16:35] into the ark two and two of All Flesh
[16:37] wherein is the breath of life I think
[16:39] it's just a big summary of a lot that
[16:40] was taking place there says and they
[16:42] that went in went in male and female of
[16:44] All Flesh as God had commanded him and
[16:47] the Lord shut him in he enters into the
[16:51] ark according to the Commandment them
[16:53] and those his family with them eight of
[16:55] them enter into the ark with it says the
[16:56] two of All Flesh male and female and
[16:59] then the Lord shuts the door and the
[17:01] flood was 40 days upon the earth and the
[17:04] waters increased and bear up the ark and
[17:05] it was lifted up above the earth and the
[17:08] waters prevailed and were increased
[17:10] greatly upon the earth and the Ark went
[17:12] upon the face of the waters so now it's
[17:14] moving and being moved by the water and
[17:16] the waters prevailed exceedingly upon
[17:17] the Earth upon the high hills that were
[17:20] under the whole Heaven were covered 15
[17:23] cubits upward did the waters Prevail and
[17:25] the mountains were covered in All Flesh
[17:28] died that moved upon the Earth so God
[17:32] wasn't kidding when he said the end of
[17:33] All Flesh has come before me and the
[17:36] Earth is filled with violence through
[17:37] this flesh so I'm going to destroy them
[17:40] with the Earth All Flesh died that moved
[17:43] upon the Earth both of foul and of
[17:44] cattle and of Beast and every creeping
[17:46] thing that creepeth upon the Earth and
[17:48] every man all in whose nostrils was the
[17:52] Breath of Life of all that was in the
[17:54] dry land died and every living substance
[17:57] was destroyed which was a upon the face
[17:59] of the ground both Man and Cattle and
[18:01] the creeping things and the foul of the
[18:03] heaven and they were destroyed from the
[18:05] earth and Noah only remained alive and
[18:07] they that were with him in the ark when
[18:11] Jesus says As it was in the days of Noah
[18:13] he summarizes say that the day that he
[18:14] entered in the ark the flood came and
[18:17] destroyed them all and as God said the
[18:20] Earth is filled with violence through
[18:22] flesh I'm going to destroy him from the
[18:24] face of the Earth he does exactly what
[18:25] he says and he sends the waters as a
[18:28] flood upon the Earth and it destroys all
[18:30] that had breath upon the land except
[18:33] those that were in the ark and a very
[18:36] similar instance but on a much smaller
[18:38] scale and through the use of fire it
[18:40] says in the days of lot we know that lot
[18:42] escaped Sodom and God destroyed the rest
[18:46] in Genesis CH 13:13 and very similar to
[18:50] what he says in chapter 6:3 but the men
[18:52] of Sodom were Wicked and sinners be
[18:54] before the Lord exceedingly lot chose
[18:57] those uh LS of Sodom and Gomorrah
[19:00] Abraham separates himself from lot and
[19:03] he go chooses to live uh not with L
[19:06] Sodom and view but he lives away from
[19:08] there and away from these wicked men but
[19:10] this is the men of were Wicked and
[19:12] sinners before the Lord so you go
[19:15] forward five chapters in Genesis Chapter
[19:17] 18 verses 20 and 21 it says the Lord
[19:20] said because the Cry of Sodom and
[19:23] gamorra is great and because their sin
[19:25] is very Grievous now I kind of jumped
[19:27] into the middle of the story of these uh
[19:29] three that meet with Abraham and Sarah
[19:32] they're at the tent door there in the
[19:33] cool In the Heat of the day they come
[19:36] and they're eating together and they're
[19:37] fellowshipping they have a message for
[19:39] Abraham about Sarah but now he says the
[19:41] Cry of Sodom is great because of their
[19:43] sin says I will go now down now and see
[19:47] whether they have done alt together
[19:48] according to the Cry of it is it what it
[19:52] sounds like is it what it what I think
[19:53] it is which has come unto me and if not
[19:55] I will know now this phrase or this
[19:58] statement as we may uh look at here in a
[20:00] little bit it indicates that God is
[20:02] going to investigate he's sending these
[20:04] Messengers down there to look at the
[20:07] condition of Sodom and if it is as he
[20:10] thinks it is I know I'm just kind of
[20:11] using the language as it suggested here
[20:14] then he's going to bring
[20:15] judgment the the the visiting of Sodom
[20:19] and Gomorrah because of this Cry of
[20:21] their wickedness was for the purpose of
[20:23] judgment and
[20:25] destruction so chapter 19: 24 25 the
[20:29] Lord then the Lord reigned upon Solomon
[20:32] and upon Gomorrah Brimstone and fire
[20:35] from the Lord out of heaven and he
[20:37] overthrew the those cities and all the
[20:40] plain and all the inhabitants of the
[20:43] cities and that which grew upon the
[20:45] ground so it just burned it
[20:47] over something was growing from the
[20:49] ground it was burned if there was
[20:51] inhabitants of the cities and the plain
[20:53] they were burned verse 279 says that God
[20:55] destroyed the cities of the plain
[20:59] so as it was in the days of lot God sees
[21:03] wickedness and he sends fire and
[21:05] brimstone to judge that wickedness and
[21:07] all that remained in the plain and in
[21:09] the cities were destroyed even those
[21:12] things which grew upon the ground God
[21:14] using water God using fire as it was in
[21:17] the days of Noah as it was in the days
[21:18] of lot and as you read what Jesus says
[21:21] he highlights destruction when you read
[21:24] the scriptures in Genesis 7 and Genesis
[21:26] 18 and 19 we see that it is destruction
[21:30] and these days are used to highlight
[21:32] when Jesus says As it was in these days
[21:35] so shall it be in the day when the son
[21:37] of man is revealed he uses these days to
[21:39] highlight a dispensation of Judgment of
[21:42] wickedness highlight a judgment of sin
[21:45] that they were allowed to continue God
[21:47] allowed the cries to come up God allowed
[21:49] men to increase in the Earth but there
[21:51] comes a point where God says enough is
[21:53] enough I'm going to do something about
[21:55] this God just wasn't up there with his
[21:58] finger as soon as someone told a like go
[22:00] they're dead right God's just waiting
[22:03] and next thing you know after he's done
[22:04] it's like oh I'm sorry Noah you're
[22:05] you're the only one left and Noah's like
[22:08] well I mean what can you do God but
[22:12] rather God allows things to continue and
[22:14] things
[22:15] unfold but God specifically uses Christ
[22:19] specifically uses these days to
[22:23] introduce this aspect of judgment that
[22:25] has been committed to the son of man
[22:29] now I wouldn't want you to assume based
[22:31] upon my emphasis today that's the only
[22:33] aspect because there's so much contained
[22:35] in these words that are shared in Luke
[22:37] 17 and Matthew 24 but I'm just wanting
[22:40] today to highlight this aspect of
[22:42] judgment in 1 Peter chapter 3: 18 to 20
[22:47] you'll find that in the New Testament as
[22:48] we'll read a few places in the Epistles
[22:50] of Peter and then also believe in Jude
[22:54] you'll find this characterization of
[22:57] these days and you'll find that Peter
[22:59] and the ones uh that that would have
[23:01] heard even this commandment and it being
[23:03] rehearsed in their ears about in as it
[23:05] was in the days of lot as it was in the
[23:07] days of Noah so shall it be in the day
[23:09] of the coming and revealing of the son
[23:11] of man notice how Peter addresses this
[23:14] for Christ also hath once suffered for
[23:16] sins the just for the unjust that he
[23:19] might bring us to God being put to death
[23:22] in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
[23:25] what beautiful poetry it's wonderful
[23:28] by which also he went and preached unto
[23:32] the spirits in prison now this is quite
[23:34] a statement and this is this is a
[23:37] sentence that's been wrestled with ever
[23:39] since it was pinned and there's a lot of
[23:41] ways that people try to make sense of it
[23:43] and and well when did this preaching
[23:45] happen and how did it unfold but it says
[23:47] he went and preached unto the spirits or
[23:50] Souls that were in prison which sometime
[23:52] were disobedient so he's preaching to
[23:55] souls forever imprisoned and because
[23:58] they were disobedient says they were
[24:00] some at some time were disobedient so in
[24:03] the past they were disobedient and we
[24:05] might then I think just being If we're
[24:07] honest with ourselves we like that would
[24:09] be me Paul said in Titus we were all
[24:12] subject to diverse lust and we were all
[24:14] Disobedience and the world influenced us
[24:16] and we did things that were wrong he
[24:18] says so they were disobedient when Once
[24:20] the longsuffering of God waited in the
[24:23] days of Noah while the ark was a prepare
[24:27] preparing we're in few that is eight
[24:29] Souls were saved by water
[24:33] now speaking of Christ quickened by the
[24:37] spirit brought us to God being put to
[24:40] Death In the Flesh being raised up for
[24:43] our justification seated at the right
[24:45] hand of the Father the Majesty on high
[24:47] he is now forever there or he is forever
[24:51] a help to us to bring us into God's
[24:53] presence but then he kind of takes this
[24:55] aspect that he also went and preached to
[24:57] Spirits in prison the spirits in prison
[25:00] were disobedient in the day of Noah he's
[25:04] using this as an example he said uh the
[25:06] longsuffering god waited in the days of
[25:08] Noah while the ark was a preparing he's
[25:11] using this Ark now as Noah Was preparing
[25:13] the ark there was some testimony or
[25:16] witness there was something there that
[25:18] as Noah was getting the ark ready that
[25:21] was the longsuffering of God it wasn't
[25:24] God was s going come on Noah seriously I
[25:27] put it all on the the earth I told you
[25:29] how to do it it's taking you forever but
[25:30] God allowed that Ark to be a testimony
[25:33] God allowed it to be a conversation
[25:35] piece God allowed it to be like Noah
[25:37] seriously what are you doing like well
[25:39] it's going to rain and rain would be
[25:41] what right it's going to fall out of the
[25:43] heavens and the Earth is going to open
[25:44] up beneath and everyone on the face of
[25:46] the Earth is going to be destroyed and
[25:47] this is the only thing that's going to
[25:48] survive and it would give an opportunity
[25:50] for someone in their heart to say and
[25:51] where did you get this from he says God
[25:53] spoke to me well who is this God how did
[25:55] he communicate with you and says well my
[25:57] father ate Adam did this and did that
[25:59] and be able to witness and testify and
[26:01] it would have been a conversation piece
[26:02] and so he's saying that God was merciful
[26:05] here it says longsuffering so it speaks
[26:06] of his patience but yet it's this
[26:08] patience exhibits of Mercy that while
[26:11] the ark was being prepared this was
[26:13] God's mercy to them but then in the end
[26:16] only eight Souls were saved by water
[26:20] Noah and his household so it's these
[26:23] Spirits in prison these are souls that
[26:26] can never be saved
[26:28] these are souls that died disobedient
[26:31] that are without Mercy if I could say it
[26:34] this way them being in prison in this uh
[26:37] in this place of imprisonment they had
[26:40] crossed some line into this eternal
[26:43] damnation but when the longsuffering of
[26:45] God waited in the days of Noah while the
[26:47] AR Ark Was
[26:49] preparing was there no room for
[26:53] mercy in 2 Peter chap 2: 1-6
[26:58] he says' but there were false prophets
[27:00] also among the people even as there
[27:01] shall be false teachers among you who
[27:04] privil shall bring in damnable heresies
[27:06] even denying the Lord that brought
[27:07] bought them and bring upon themselves
[27:10] Swift destruction and many shall follow
[27:13] their pernicious Ways by reason of whom
[27:15] the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
[27:18] why will the way of Truth be evil spoken
[27:20] of because it's going to be so
[27:22] close there's going to be some name of
[27:24] Christ attached to it verse three and
[27:26] through covetousness shall they with fed
[27:28] words make merchandise of you wow he
[27:31] just so succinctly described nominal
[27:34] Christianity and it says they will make
[27:36] merchandise of you whose judgment now of
[27:38] a long time linger not and their
[27:41] damnation slumbereth not forth God
[27:43] spared not the angels that sin but cast
[27:45] them down to Hell and deliver them into
[27:47] chains of Darkness to be reserved un
[27:49] judgment there's your place of
[27:51] imprisonment these chains of darkness
[27:53] and this imprisonment this place of
[27:54] waiting awaiting judgment it's not a
[27:56] literal burning hell now but it's a
[27:59] place of of a prison a jail house
[28:03] reserved unto judgment and spared not
[28:06] the old world but saved Noah the eighth
[28:09] person a preacher of righteousness
[28:11] bringing in the flood upon the world of
[28:13] the ungodly now notice again how it
[28:15] expresses Noah as being a preacher of
[28:19] righteousness while Noah Was preparing
[28:21] the ark he was a an exhibitor a
[28:23] displayer he was one that was a preacher
[28:26] of righteousness he had a testimony he
[28:27] had a Ministry he had an advocacy where
[28:29] he's preaching Before the Flood came in
[28:32] the days of old God judged the world but
[28:35] Noah during that time was a preacher of
[28:37] righteousness and bringing in the flood
[28:39] upon the world of the ungodly and
[28:40] turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
[28:43] into ashes condemned them with an
[28:45] overthrow making them an example and
[28:48] ample unto those that after should live
[28:51] ungodly this is Peter now writing as it
[28:54] was in the days of Noah and as it was in
[28:56] the days of lot he uses this that
[29:00] there's going to be judgment upon them
[29:02] that turn the way of Truth into
[29:04] unrighteousness that are going to have
[29:07] pernicious ways and make merchandise of
[29:09] the people he's saying they're going to
[29:10] be judged they're not going to escape
[29:13] judgment and he uses the Angels which
[29:15] were spared not he uses the days of Noah
[29:17] in which the people were spared not and
[29:19] he uses the days of lot in which the
[29:21] people burned into ashes right he says
[29:24] there are examples of what should happen
[29:25] to those that live ungodly
[29:28] right Jude when he's writing in verses 5
[29:31] six and 7 he uses a language very
[29:33] similar to what Peter is writing in his
[29:35] Epistles I will therefore put you in
[29:37] remembrance though you once knew this
[29:38] how that the Lord having saved the
[29:41] people out of the land of Egypt
[29:42] afterward destroyed them that believed
[29:45] not so he had saved some and there had
[29:47] been an exodus but then in that move and
[29:50] in that Exodus there were some that
[29:52] didn't actually believe they just got
[29:53] caught up in the movement and he said he
[29:55] destroyed them that believed not and the
[29:58] angels which kept not their first estate
[30:00] but left their own habitation Heath
[30:02] reserved in Everlasting chains under
[30:04] Darkness unto the Judgment of the great
[30:06] day again Jude now is saying that just
[30:09] look at these examples that people who
[30:11] live ungodly and those who are
[30:12] disobedient unrighteous there's going to
[30:14] be a judgment come right it's it's it's
[30:18] inescapable there's going to be a
[30:20] judgment of the great day and we know
[30:22] that there's a lot of application of
[30:23] these things to the time in which all uh
[30:27] who are not part of the first
[30:28] resurrection are going to stand before
[30:29] white Throne judgment and the books are
[30:31] going to be used to judge them according
[30:33] to the works he says in verse 7 even as
[30:35] Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about
[30:37] them in like manner giving themselves
[30:39] over to
[30:40] fornication and going after strange
[30:42] flesh are set forth for an example
[30:45] suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire
[30:49] it's Eternal fire our God is a consuming
[30:51] fire this wrath is Judgment of God it's
[30:54] not proposing an eternal hell but it is
[30:57] opposing a finality of
[31:00] judgment the Eternal fire is the flame
[31:02] of God the Vengeance of God who is
[31:03] eternal right so again we see in the
[31:07] scripture that the days of lot and the
[31:10] days of Noah are associated with God's
[31:11] judgment on
[31:14] sin and is it said that Christ went and
[31:16] preached under the spirits in prison we
[31:18] all uh I think most of us would be
[31:20] familiar with the sermon that brother
[31:22] Brandon preached called Souls that are
[31:23] in prison now and uh just realizing The
[31:27] Nearness to an anniversary of this as it
[31:29] was November 10th
[31:31] 1963 now those of you here who are
[31:35] familiar with this sermon how many can
[31:36] remember the first time you really heard
[31:38] what was being
[31:39] preached I can remember I remember I was
[31:43] still in my undergraduate uh studies and
[31:46] I remember listening to it on my way to
[31:47] school and you know chances are I I
[31:51] might have not gone to class that
[31:52] morning and I remember I I list to that
[31:54] tape every day over and over and over
[31:57] again and thinking okay I I I want to
[32:00] under I I need to Something's I need to
[32:02] hear this I need to understand I need to
[32:04] come to a peace with this this is it was
[32:06] the first time in my life I really
[32:08] actually heard
[32:10] it and it is I think a kind of a
[32:13] remarkable sermon I do believe that I am
[32:18] I'm not responsible for interpreting
[32:20] anything that brother brandham said to
[32:22] you I I don't even I don't even think I
[32:25] I'm responsible for telling you that
[32:26] it's right or wrong
[32:29] I'm responsible for telling you what he
[32:31] taught and you can determine for
[32:33] yourself whether or not you want to
[32:34] believe it but in Souls that are in
[32:36] prison now it says he says this Noah's
[32:38] Ministry all Ministries done the same
[32:40] Noah preached that's exactly right he
[32:43] went into the ark and when he went into
[32:46] the ark there were seven days that
[32:47] nothing happened his testimony preached
[32:50] to the doom and he says Sodom and
[32:52] Gomorrah Jesus referred to both of them
[32:54] as coming before the coming of the son
[32:56] of man so shall it be like the days of
[32:58] Noah so shall it be like it was in the
[33:00] days of Sodom he referred to
[33:03] Noah so in this sermon Souls that are in
[33:06] prison now which I wanted to focus on
[33:07] this just so you can see this judgment
[33:10] aspect of this revealing of the son of
[33:12] man and just how real it
[33:14] is he is saying he is bringing into this
[33:17] sermon that when Noah entered into the
[33:18] ark it was uh he there was a testimony
[33:22] there was a preaching to the
[33:24] doomed he says Jesus refers to both of
[33:26] them in Luke 17
[33:28] and the sermon the flashing red lights
[33:30] red light of the sign of his coming he
[33:32] preached it earlier it was in June of
[33:33] that summer he says what will happen
[33:36] just exactly like it was in the days of
[33:38] Noah one day the door of Mercy will be
[33:41] closed right so there's this aspect in
[33:43] the days of Noah that let's we could
[33:46] just be realistic about it that when the
[33:48] floods came and destroyed them all it
[33:50] was too
[33:53] late right it's too late not much you
[33:56] can do at that point so if God was going
[33:58] to say I'm going to end your life at a
[34:00] certain time it just it's just the the
[34:03] the reality that there can come a point
[34:06] where it's like it's time the time has
[34:10] arrived so when the door was shut it
[34:12] when the Genesis says the Lord shut him
[34:15] in by it's necessary for us to think
[34:19] about or I I say not necessary for us to
[34:20] think about it but if God shut him in
[34:23] others were shut out and no matter how
[34:26] much they pounded on that door no matter
[34:27] how much they They begged at that door
[34:30] Noah saying if I could open it I would
[34:33] but I'm not the one that shut
[34:36] it and so it was
[34:39] a a door of Mercy
[34:42] closing now I there are so many
[34:44] scriptures that I've been reading lately
[34:46] on
[34:47] Mercy that it just feel uh it was a real
[34:51] intense wrestling and praying with the
[34:54] Lord to just find the the the focus
[34:56] today to share these things I and I just
[34:58] I pray that it'll be beneficial to you
[35:00] to hear these things though it's so
[35:02] narrow and focused on judgment today but
[35:05] think of this what Mercy if there if the
[35:07] door of Mercy's closed then whatever uh
[35:10] is in that place if door kind of tell me
[35:13] it's access if there was a room to Mercy
[35:15] and if I can make it into this place I
[35:17] have access to Mercy a a and there is uh
[35:21] there's protection or there's something
[35:23] that's granted to me I can obtain as it
[35:25] says in the New Testament obtained Mercy
[35:26] obtained Mercy that if the door is Clos
[35:29] I can't obtain it I no longer have
[35:31] access to it I can't find myself in that
[35:33] place where Mercy is then we then think
[35:36] about the
[35:37] consequence well if Mercy's not
[35:40] available go into the New Testament and
[35:43] maybe we can do some uh some teaching on
[35:45] this in the near future that Mercy is
[35:48] connected with almost every work that
[35:50] Christ
[35:51] did that when they wanted to be healed
[35:53] they pleaded for the mercies of God to
[35:55] be merciful to them so divine healing
[35:58] and the healing of the body is it takes
[36:00] God's mercy to do that and in Titus 3:
[36:05] uh 4 to six as we've read already but
[36:07] after that after we were Sinners and and
[36:10] Le LED astray the kindness and love of
[36:12] God our savior toward man appeared not
[36:15] by works of righteousness which we have
[36:17] done these works of the law The Works of
[36:19] the flesh the works of righteousness the
[36:21] thing the correct things that we do we
[36:23] have not earned our Salvation we have
[36:25] not earned our seal we have not earned
[36:27] the love and favor of God but according
[36:30] to his Mercy he saved us his Mercy saved
[36:34] us if there was not Mercy there could
[36:36] not be salvation if there was not Mercy
[36:39] there could not be the washing of
[36:40] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[36:42] Ghost which he shed on us abundantly
[36:44] through Jesus Christ Our Savior It Is by
[36:47] God's mercy that he has shed AB Upon Us
[36:50] abundantly washing and regeneration and
[36:52] the renewing of the Holy Ghost it is by
[36:54] his Mercy that we are covered by his
[36:57] blood am amen without Mercy there is no
[37:02] salvation if I can say this no more
[37:04] Mercy means no more Saving right no more
[37:08] Mercy means no more no more
[37:10] healing and I would argue I would
[37:12] probably suggest that if we were to
[37:14] think that there's no more Mercy we
[37:16] probably would all begin to make those
[37:17] conclusions well if there's no mercy
[37:19] there's no
[37:22] salvation so there is this Spectre of
[37:26] judgment
[37:28] there is this concept that the door God
[37:31] as God shut the door in the days of Noah
[37:33] could it be that there would be a time
[37:35] when God has closed it in the door of
[37:37] Mercy is shut and now there's no one
[37:39] else to be
[37:41] saved there there's no more there's no
[37:43] more access as it were to the atonement
[37:45] for Divine Healing there's no more
[37:50] deliverance and so I want to read these
[37:52] statements to you I think we I thought I
[37:53] was doing really horrible on time
[37:54] brother Andrew gave us plenty of time
[37:56] and then I got lost in the prelims which
[37:58] I don't normally do that I'm trying to
[38:00] be better at being a person a human
[38:02] being not just a an Autobot that just
[38:05] immediately goes into preaching and so
[38:08] listen to how brother BR wrestles with
[38:10] this and souls that are in prison now he
[38:13] says I don't know that this thing is
[38:15] true but it's got to be that way
[38:18] sometime right if I could just use his
[38:21] statement from flashing red light at the
[38:22] sign of his coming the door of Mercy
[38:24] being closed I don't know that this
[38:27] thing is true but it's got to be that
[38:28] way sometime it's got to come to that
[38:30] and it could be
[38:32] now okay all right in every way the
[38:37] world will carry right on people still
[38:39] come to the altar they'll still cry out
[38:41] but it won't do no good they'll be gone
[38:43] it'll be over there won't be he says
[38:47] there won't be no
[38:49] mercy the double negative to make a
[38:51] double point no more Mercy remember that
[38:55] and the sanctuary becomes Smoky he
[38:57] that's filled filthy is filthy still he
[38:58] that's righteous is righteous still and
[39:00] he that's holy is Holy still he says he
[39:02] makes this statement several places in
[39:05] the Revelation Jesus Christ Series this
[39:07] the the sanctuary being Smoky and this
[39:09] time of the cleaning of the sanctuary it
[39:11] connects to Daniel different places says
[39:14] there is no mercy when the lamb takes
[39:16] the book that's it that's all of
[39:19] it okay we we can accept that we can see
[39:23] that in the scripture according to
[39:24] Revelations 4 then chapter 5 how that
[39:27] the lamb uh is the The Lion of the tribe
[39:29] of J prevails to take the book and to
[39:31] loose the seals thereof and then the the
[39:34] chapters that follow talk about a lot of
[39:35] different stuff and we can see uh even
[39:38] the judgments that come and the plagues
[39:39] that come and all these things that are
[39:41] poured out upon the Earth and he says
[39:42] when the lamb takes the book that's it
[39:44] that's all of it and it looks a whole
[39:46] like whole lot like it could be
[39:50] now all right let's debate it right what
[39:56] would he be
[39:57] considering that would cause him to say
[40:00] I don't
[40:01] know but it could be now because when
[40:04] the lamb takes the book to me it looks
[40:07] like that's it and so that that's it
[40:11] could be now
[40:14] why why why would he say
[40:18] that I'll leave it to you to wrestle
[40:20] with it he says maybe we have another
[40:23] day maybe today is that day maybe
[40:25] tomorrow is remember how he had said
[40:28] well when Noah went he preached and
[40:30] there was these several days where
[40:32] nothing
[40:34] happened that you would think as soon as
[40:36] the door was shut as soon as the book
[40:37] was taken as soon as things were open
[40:39] boom that's it it's all over but months
[40:41] go by or days go by and things happen
[40:43] it's like what's happening
[40:45] here maybe tonight is the last night
[40:49] maybe this is the last year I don't know
[40:51] friends I'm telling you I don't know
[40:54] it'll never be told me but when God
[40:56] takes that last name and redeems it from
[40:58] that book of life that's all of it they
[41:00] can't they can't be no more anyhow in
[41:03] other words when the last name in the
[41:05] Lamb's Book of
[41:07] Life is that that sealing when that
[41:09] takes place well there what what is the
[41:12] I know this ERS into a whole
[41:14] area that is always fascinating to talk
[41:17] about over good food right with your
[41:19] precious brothers and sisters and
[41:20] Believers in Christ but there has to be
[41:22] there's a line
[41:24] somewhere right that the the there's uh
[41:28] even as the Bible says the days will be
[41:29] short and otherwise there be no flesh
[41:30] saved in other words if we just it's
[41:33] going to continue to a point to where
[41:34] the last has been redeemed and if the
[41:37] days continue there's no more Christians
[41:39] on Earth there's no more witness of God
[41:41] on Earth God by forn knowledge knew
[41:44] those had had elected those to a new
[41:47] birth there's the seed of predestination
[41:49] inside of them the preach of the Gospel
[41:52] by faith you receive that word of God
[41:54] and you're Quicken to life and you make
[41:55] up the body of Christ it's a fulfillment
[41:58] of be fruitful multiply and replenish
[42:00] the Earth it wasn't stack people up like
[42:03] cordwood but it was like there's a
[42:05] measure that I want to bring forth that
[42:07] are mine there's a measure of Fellowship
[42:10] there's a measure of my body I need them
[42:12] to come forth but through the fall you
[42:14] have the record of the wheat plant you
[42:15] have the record of human life you have
[42:17] the Book of Life which all men
[42:20] participate in and all men have their
[42:21] name in it but there is a group of
[42:23] people whose names are in the Lamb's
[42:25] Book of Life whose names connect ever be
[42:27] removed that's God's grace that's God's
[42:30] mercy that's God's love nothing you
[42:33] did you know well I got lucky I signed
[42:36] the Lamb's Book of Life instead of the
[42:37] guest book no it's not you that did
[42:41] it there's a mass of
[42:44] humanity that whose names aren't in the
[42:47] record that cannot be
[42:49] removed but yet God still has Grace on
[42:53] them God still has them in a book
[42:58] God still gives them an
[43:01] opportunity but is once that La that
[43:04] life that has Redemption attached to it
[43:07] has been redeemed there can't be any
[43:09] more redeemed right like we all know
[43:12] like once you eat the last Eminem you
[43:14] can't eat any more
[43:17] M&M's there he says that that there
[43:19] can't be no more anyhow that's all it's
[43:24] finished he says again God forbid God
[43:26] forbid bid that what I've said is
[43:28] now may I understand it everybody God
[43:32] forbid do you
[43:34] recognize what he's wrestling with right
[43:38] is the the consequences of certain
[43:40] scriptural
[43:41] events and I would I would even say that
[43:44] if you go back and you read his
[43:46] Revelation series and the different
[43:47] parts and the things that he says even
[43:48] in the breach uh the fourth and fifth
[43:50] six seal the things that he's wrestling
[43:52] with in those sermons you realize that
[43:54] there's a there's something transpiring
[43:56] scripture he sees an event in the
[43:58] scripture that's connected to these
[44:00] things even in its symbolic form and we
[44:02] can say well if this happens this is
[44:03] what happens next so maybe we make
[44:05] assumptions are we envision it happening
[44:07] a certain way and he's saying now if
[44:10] this is where we are now if the
[44:11] imminence of these things are upon us or
[44:13] certain things have happened then could
[44:15] it be that right now is a time where
[44:18] things are over it's done and the only
[44:20] reason why we're still here is because
[44:22] there's this season of time as it was in
[44:24] the days of Noah to where there's that
[44:27] are going to be
[44:30] judged and it's all finished and he says
[44:33] I I God forbid he said I hope it's not I
[44:37] got children that's not in I've got two
[44:41] daughters and a son I've got Brothers
[44:43] I've got my people that's not in God
[44:45] forbid that Grace has left us that all
[44:50] this will only be
[44:54] pretending he says is there Grace left
[44:57] left Lord let me be wrong on this Lord
[45:00] let it be wrong at this time that I it
[45:02] isn't the people still can be
[45:07] saved well I think it really does uh
[45:10] show the heart of brother
[45:14] brandom was it this cultish idea of well
[45:17] you know those of you who are with me in
[45:18] this we're going to be fine and we're
[45:20] going to have some punch served after
[45:22] service it was oh
[45:25] my I've got love there's people I love
[45:28] don't let it be there wasn't this Glee
[45:31] of oh yeah you know they're all all
[45:34] serpent seed are going to get what's
[45:35] coming to them there's even this aspect
[45:38] of this intercession in the prophet
[45:40] Spirit Lord is there Grace left can
[45:42] people still get saved he asked the
[45:44] question later what if it what if it's
[45:48] over what if the third pull coming up
[45:50] now is to preach to the
[45:52] Lost what if all the types are going to
[45:55] show forth now right this is a prophet
[45:58] he's asking questions he's not trying to
[45:59] give you all the answers as a matter of
[46:01] fact he's saying it looks like a whole
[46:02] lot like it could be this way and he
[46:04] said God forbid that it is I hope I'm
[46:06] wrong that it's now I hope that I'm
[46:08] wrong that it's or it's this close that
[46:09] these are the things that are
[46:13] happening I think this is where I want
[46:15] to kind of just transition a little bit
[46:18] he said could it be that the third pulls
[46:19] to preach to the
[46:21] Lost November 11th
[46:24] 1963 Souls that are in prison now I
[46:27] trust that you have learned this about
[46:28] the third pull that if you only take up
[46:30] to this
[46:31] moment brother Ram's teaching about the
[46:34] third pull then you would just have a
[46:37] gigantic question mark over your head
[46:40] and you say well we don't know what it
[46:41] is or what it does but if you stay in
[46:43] the message we now know what it is and
[46:45] what it
[46:46] does and he says and Look Away to Jesus
[46:48] at the end of that year watch the third
[46:50] pull then and it'll be absolutely to the
[46:53] total
[46:55] lost now now is not there's not a hedge
[46:59] necessarily it'll absolutely be to the
[47:01] total
[47:02] lost but it will be for the bride
[47:06] correct he says and the
[47:08] church it'll absolutely be to the total
[47:11] loss but it's not just to the total L
[47:14] could it be that this third poll coming
[47:15] up now is to preach to the Lost we could
[47:18] say that based upon his conclusion here
[47:20] yes yes it is to the lost but it's also
[47:23] for the church it's also for the bride
[47:27] yes it's for those that are going to be
[47:28] judged yes it's for the lost but it's
[47:30] also for the saved it's also for the
[47:33] found in 1 Peter 1: 3 to5 notice this
[47:37] aspect of this great Mercy blessed be
[47:40] God and the father of our Lord Jesus
[47:41] Christ which according to His abundant
[47:43] Mercy hath begotten us again and a
[47:46] lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[47:48] Christ from the dead according to what
[47:52] are we born again according to what have
[47:54] we been sealed with the Holy Ghost his
[47:56] abund abundant Mercy if there's no mercy
[47:59] there's no being born again if there's
[48:01] no mercy there's no washing of
[48:02] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[48:04] Ghost because it's not by our works of
[48:06] righteousness but according to his work
[48:08] of Mercy that he saved us and according
[48:11] to His abundant Mercy he has begotten us
[48:13] again into a living Lively Hope by the
[48:16] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[48:18] dead having been born again we are
[48:20] raised from the dead to an inheritance
[48:22] Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[48:24] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[48:26] you this baptism of the Holy Ghost being
[48:29] the earnest of full
[48:32] Redemption now we who have received this
[48:34] holy ghost in verse 5 he says who are
[48:35] kept by the power of God through faith
[48:39] unto
[48:40] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[48:43] last
[48:44] time salvation requires
[48:47] mercy and for us to be begotten again
[48:50] under a Living Hope and to be washed and
[48:53] regenerated by the renewing of the Holy
[48:55] Ghost it took God 's abundant mercy and
[48:58] now he says to those of us who have
[49:01] obtained this in our hearts are kept by
[49:03] the power of God through faith unto for
[49:05] the purpose of Salvation that is going
[49:08] to be revealed in the
[49:10] end and if there's going to be a
[49:12] Salvation revealed in the end if
[49:14] salvation requires Mercy there's still
[49:16] yet Mercy in the
[49:18] end there could still yet be Mercy in
[49:21] the time of judgment he says in verse 13
[49:24] wherefore guard up the loin of your mind
[49:26] be sober and hope to the end for the
[49:28] grace that is brought unto you at the
[49:30] revelation of Jesus Christ we know that
[49:33] by Grace we are saved through faith that
[49:35] that in itself the grace and the faith
[49:37] is a gift of God not by our works lest
[49:39] any man should boast so it is by grace
[49:42] that we are saved it is by Mercy that we
[49:44] are saved it is by those aspects that
[49:46] our souls are cleansed and purged of sin
[49:49] and the power of God quickens us to life
[49:51] to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:53] Christians Sons and Daughters of God
[49:56] baptized of the body of Christ by one
[49:58] Spirit who are kept by the power of God
[50:01] who are sober and hoping to the end for
[50:03] a Salvation to be revealed and a Grace
[50:06] that's to be brought to us by at that
[50:08] revealing a Grace that comes at the
[50:11] revelation of Jesus
[50:13] Christ if I could say this the
[50:15] revelation of the son of man brings
[50:18] judgment there's no question that days
[50:20] of Noah and the days of lot bring
[50:22] judgment but it also brings Grace
[50:26] it also brings the love of God into
[50:28] plain you it brings Mercy in Psalms
[50:32] 102:13 Thou shalt arise oh when he's
[50:36] Rising that would be a tremendous thing
[50:39] it would be a a a heart shaking thing
[50:41] could this be a moment he's Rising now
[50:44] from his place where he has been is is
[50:47] everything changing is everyone
[50:49] eternally doomed but Thou shalt arise
[50:51] and have mercy upon Zion for the time to
[50:55] favor her yay the set time has come amen
[50:59] he's going to have mercy upon Zion his
[51:02] work his Mountain his people for the
[51:05] time to have Grace to favor her has come
[51:08] it was a set
[51:09] time and in Genesis
[51:12] 6:8 right there in the day in which God
[51:14] said the wickedness of man is great the
[51:16] end of All Flesh has come before me I
[51:17] will destroy them from the earth God
[51:20] coming down to judge it says but Noah
[51:22] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[51:26] in the day when the son of man is
[51:28] revealed when Jesus says the day that no
[51:29] had entered the Ark he said there's your
[51:33] mercy when he says he destroyed them all
[51:35] there's your
[51:36] judgment in Genesis 18: 23 when God had
[51:40] said that I'm going to go down and I'm
[51:41] going to look into Sodom and Gomorrah H
[51:44] because their sin is very Grievous and
[51:45] I'm going to check and see if what I
[51:47] have heard is as as it was the very next
[51:50] response in verse 23 by Abraham it says
[51:53] Abraham Drew near cuz they they begin to
[51:56] go down these Messengers he said wil
[51:58] thou also destroy the righteous with the
[52:01] Wicked This is a this to me is the heart
[52:05] of this Prophet this Abraham who in this
[52:07] moment that he realizes wait you're
[52:09] going to
[52:11] destroy all those that are in the city
[52:14] and there's this instinctive
[52:16] intercession from Abraham's heart
[52:19] Abraham didn't
[52:21] go I'm going to get my son he's already
[52:24] promised it lot where did your Choice
[52:26] get you now buddy
[52:29] boy how are those well-watered planes
[52:31] treating
[52:33] you right he that wasn't his Instinct
[52:36] his Instinct was say will the righteous
[52:38] also be destroyed with the wicked so in
[52:40] the very moment when God pronounces this
[52:42] dispensation of judgment there's this
[52:44] Mercy if I could say this this
[52:46] mediatorial work by Abraham even this
[52:48] intercession by Abraham and this time
[52:50] and this moment it the the the fire
[52:53] hasn't fallen yet the door is not shut
[52:56] yet will you destroy the righteous even
[52:58] with the
[53:00] wicked if I could say this just trying
[53:03] to wrap this up this third pull brings a
[53:05] finality right brings this
[53:08] separation it's a it divides as a
[53:11] necessity now you're not the one that
[53:12] draws a
[53:14] line but brother brandham says could it
[53:17] be that the third pool is to be preached
[53:19] to the Lost he's not trying to limit the
[53:21] scope of the third pool to where the
[53:22] only aspect of the ministry of Christ in
[53:26] the end time is to let everybody know
[53:28] they're eternally
[53:29] lost but he's looking at the
[53:31] consequences right of scriptural events
[53:35] he's thinking about he's looking at the
[53:36] ramifications of the events related to
[53:39] what he's calling the third pool if I
[53:42] could say it this way all could
[53:43] participate in
[53:45] healing everyone can participate in that
[53:48] the fact that someone has been divinely
[53:50] healed which means God by his power and
[53:52] his in his grace and mercy takes someone
[53:54] who is sick someone who has a cancer
[53:55] someone who has a miss limb someone
[53:57] who's blind and the power of God
[53:58] operates upon them to heal them all can
[54:00] participate in that are there barriers
[54:03] to anyone being a beneficial of it yes
[54:05] as far as unbelief and sin there's
[54:07] things that can hinder that but we could
[54:08] you could have someone who is a sinner
[54:10] and someone who is in unbelief and
[54:12] someone who hasn't professed Christ as
[54:13] their savior can in a moment have faith
[54:15] to believe in healing and believe there
[54:18] that they can be healed and be healed
[54:19] even though their soul has not been
[54:22] healed all can even participate in
[54:25] prophesying right
[54:27] people can have prophecy spoken over
[54:30] them they could
[54:32] have the word they could have healing
[54:35] and prophecies and these different gifts
[54:37] manifesting but the third pole is a
[54:38] dividing
[54:41] line as we're seeing we can see in the
[54:44] scripture this revealing of the son of
[54:46] man is
[54:47] Judgment but let me close with just a a
[54:51] few several more statements here and
[54:53] just a couple scriptures have have
[54:54] dozens of scriptures that I could use
[54:56] this this but if he's going to have
[54:59] judgment it requires
[55:03] Mercy it it if there's going to be
[55:06] judgment this judgment requires
[55:09] Mercy or if maybe I could say this way
[55:12] because there is Judgment Mercy can be
[55:14] found
[55:15] there where there is Justice where there
[55:18] is Judgment there's
[55:21] Mercy in Psalms 89:14 Justice and
[55:24] judgment are the habitation of th th
[55:26] Throne we could say yes there he is
[55:28] judging Justice and judgment correct
[55:32] discernment righteousness and judgment
[55:34] are the habitation of thy Throne it's
[55:36] the dwelling it's it's what it is
[55:38] inhabited there that's where you can
[55:39] find it mercy and Truth Shall go before
[55:42] thy face though it be a throne that is
[55:45] inhabited by by Justice and judgment
[55:47] where there is righteousness where there
[55:49] is Justice where there is Judgment
[55:51] there's mercy and
[55:53] truth and Isaiah 16 verse5 and in Mercy
[55:57] shall the throne be
[55:59] established this is just one scripture
[56:02] in many that if there is a judgment
[56:04] Throne we say throne of grace Throne of
[56:06] Mercy if a throne of grace and a throne
[56:08] of Mercy has then changed into a throne
[56:11] of judgment we can always remember that
[56:13] it was first established in Mercy amen
[56:17] and he shall sit upon it in Truth in the
[56:20] Tabernacle of David judging and seeking
[56:23] judgment and Hasting righteousness
[56:27] right
[56:28] truth is in the throne Mercy is in the
[56:37] truth and souls that are in prison now
[56:39] brother man says now Jesus after he had
[56:41] finished his ministry preach to those
[56:43] Souls that were unsavable taking that
[56:45] from 1 Peter
[56:48] 3 their lives had already been
[56:50] extinguished he said he preached to
[56:52] those that were unsavable that could
[56:53] never be saved that could not ever be be
[56:56] saved he says now the Bible tells us
[56:58] that he went and preached to the souls
[56:59] that were in prison that repented not
[57:02] now listen to this when mercy was given
[57:05] to them they spurned mercy and now
[57:08] they're waiting for the
[57:10] Judgment oh what a time that must have
[57:14] been so when it's a time of
[57:17] judgment it isn't necessary that
[57:19] immediately there's a consequence right
[57:22] but there's something that's
[57:24] marked saying that they spurned mercy so
[57:27] now they're waiting judgment so that was
[57:29] when was there when was the Judgment
[57:31] executed when was or when was the
[57:33] Judgment pronounced there's a time when
[57:35] you go to your your uh you you can be
[57:37] judged and your sentence and the the
[57:40] actual punishment isn't uh isn't handed
[57:42] down till later which is maybe a parents
[57:44] best trick right when we get home let
[57:47] them think about it for a while but he
[57:50] says when mercy was given them they
[57:51] spurned mer Mercy now they're waiting
[57:53] judgment oh what a time that must have
[57:54] been oh I wish there was some way I
[57:57] could shake the world with that to let
[57:59] them see what the reality
[58:02] is now is he wanting to wave it in their
[58:05] face boo boo you're going to hell no I
[58:09] want them to see the reality of how
[58:11] judgment
[58:12] comes he says all those who rejected the
[58:14] message of the hour before Doom the
[58:17] gospel was preached to the doomed first
[58:20] before they went without mercy so how
[58:22] did they become
[58:23] doomed Noah shut up up was a testimony
[58:28] God shut the door after his third pull
[58:31] it's
[58:33] after Noah was a testimony then once the
[58:36] door shut he says after the third pool
[58:37] at Sodom the door was shut there was no
[58:41] more
[58:43] Mercy but he's he's want I think there's
[58:46] something that we could I mean listen if
[58:48] there was ever a sermon where you want
[58:49] to start to grasp for something to hold
[58:51] on to this would be the sermon right
[58:53] Souls that are in prison out could it be
[58:54] that the word is being preached to the
[58:56] eternally lost what year did he preach
[58:57] that 1963 if there's no more Mercy you
[58:59] can't be saved and when was I born again
[59:01] mom right I I might want to find a new
[59:04] birth certificate I'm just the the
[59:06] youngest looking 69 you've ever
[59:09] seen this is the
[59:12] reality
[59:14] of there's a reality of judgment but
[59:17] notice he's saying the Judgment comes
[59:19] after mercy
[59:21] spurned so if I could say it again you
[59:23] can't have judgment without Mercy cuz
[59:26] God's Jud judgment his Justice is
[59:31] right after the door was shut after
[59:34] these things there is no more
[59:38] Mercy he says Noah went in then after
[59:40] seven days nothing happened in the seven
[59:43] days the Judgment come listen now in
[59:46] closing if only in Noah's time they
[59:49] would have knew that
[59:52] sign if they would have only known now
[59:55] I'm going going to close he says it
[59:57] twice if they would have only know known
[1:00:00] that sign the world in that day that God
[1:00:03] proved by reading here by reading of the
[1:00:05] scripture a while ago he destroyed them
[1:00:07] people not without
[1:00:11] Mercy right and to to me it's you're
[1:00:14] saying what is he is it changing his
[1:00:15] mind is it different well it's the
[1:00:18] reality
[1:00:19] that there's a point at which you make
[1:00:22] your choice to spurn Mercy
[1:00:26] he said or a choice is made to spurn
[1:00:28] Mercy there comes a point where it runs
[1:00:29] out it's done he says not without Mercy
[1:00:32] Mercy was sent to them by a prophet they
[1:00:34] wouldn't believe it God is merciful but
[1:00:38] he sent Mercy but they wouldn't receive
[1:00:41] it he always sends mercy
[1:00:46] first listen can we call Christ a false
[1:00:50] prophet we blaspheme him and say he's
[1:00:53] nothing but a just a Jew there's nothing
[1:00:55] t he's a false figment of the
[1:00:57] imagination that there's no such thing
[1:00:59] as Christ the scriptures something
[1:01:00] concocted later on some kind of hodg
[1:01:03] podge of a fanasy and then believe that
[1:01:05] God would be merciful to
[1:01:07] us yeah I just maybe say it as a
[1:01:10] question had this conversation one time
[1:01:12] with a brother who was was was saying
[1:01:14] that he couldn't
[1:01:17] accept he couldn't accept that there was
[1:01:19] this well he say I I can't accept that
[1:01:23] only these people are going to be the
[1:01:24] ones that go up in the resurrection
[1:01:26] and so I just asked him I said okay so
[1:01:28] you you're taking issue with the line or
[1:01:30] where the line's
[1:01:33] drawn and so it's kind of this is
[1:01:36] explain further say so do you believe
[1:01:37] that everyone's going to go in the
[1:01:38] resurrection no okay so there is a line
[1:01:42] not everyone will go right where do you
[1:01:44] put
[1:01:46] it who's left out and I would say well I
[1:01:49] can't believe you're leaving them
[1:01:52] out but there is a line
[1:01:57] not without Mercy but God sent Mercy he
[1:01:59] always sends mercy
[1:02:03] first what if they would have known the
[1:02:05] sign was the end time sign and when they
[1:02:08] saw all at once salvation led
[1:02:11] up nobody just the first thing you know
[1:02:13] the door was closed there was only one
[1:02:15] person knew the sign that was no one his
[1:02:16] group that was the only one that knew
[1:02:18] when the doors swung together no one
[1:02:20] knew no one knew that was the Finish he
[1:02:22] knew it that's right if you only knew
[1:02:24] the sign oh if they would have only
[1:02:27] known the sign when they seen this one
[1:02:29] come in and had been up there with
[1:02:32] Abraham as it was in the days of Noah as
[1:02:35] it was in the days of
[1:02:37] lot if he only knew the sign if I could
[1:02:40] emphasize this today in the face of some
[1:02:43] of these things that are easy to wrestle
[1:02:45] with and try to figure out that yes if
[1:02:47] there's going to be time could it be
[1:02:49] could it be God forbid God forbid but
[1:02:51] even if it is there's still that God
[1:02:53] would not judge without first offering
[1:02:55] Mercy
[1:02:56] what if that third pole could be to the
[1:02:58] eternally lost what if it is there I
[1:03:02] hope it's not what if it
[1:03:05] is think of it just a minute now what if
[1:03:08] it
[1:03:09] is God forbid I've got
[1:03:13] children but it sure looks pretty close
[1:03:19] here he says like the pyramid come up
[1:03:22] through Luther Wesley Pentecost then the
[1:03:23] capping of the stone Brothers you could
[1:03:25] come to your instruments could it be
[1:03:28] that if that's it where are we
[1:03:33] at it this might I hope it isn't but
[1:03:37] it's going to be it's going to be just
[1:03:39] remember them Ministries has to they
[1:03:41] always dovetail just the same with the
[1:03:43] other one it has to come God don't
[1:03:45] change think of it bite your conscience
[1:03:47] with your spiritual teeth and find out
[1:03:49] where we're at what if it is and you're
[1:03:52] still the Way You Are
[1:03:55] you just might as well then walk you're
[1:03:59] finished then that's
[1:04:01] outside after the book was taken by the
[1:04:03] lamb the sick seal is revealed all the
[1:04:05] seals it's over it could
[1:04:07] be I hope it isn't could
[1:04:11] be that's it's heavy
[1:04:15] language sure looks pretty
[1:04:18] close what
[1:04:20] if and he says this I I wanted to just
[1:04:23] to catch this
[1:04:26] he says not by speaking in tongues of
[1:04:28] Souls and prison now not by dancing in
[1:04:30] the spirit not by joining church not by
[1:04:32] fruit of the spirit Christian Science
[1:04:33] can outs smother any of you on that and
[1:04:36] deny even Jesus Christ was divine not
[1:04:38] that but it's the word
[1:04:40] living there it is if they had only
[1:04:43] looked he was Messiah he was the Living
[1:04:45] Word made manifest and a man that's got
[1:04:47] the spirit of God in him or woman lives
[1:04:49] that word lives right out in them that's
[1:04:52] the heartbeat the predestinated for the
[1:04:55] word of the Lord comes to them and they
[1:04:57] are the word to the people written
[1:04:59] Epistles read of all men now if you
[1:05:02] could just kind of take that into your
[1:05:03] heart that now you become the heartbeat
[1:05:05] the predestiny become the heartbeat of
[1:05:07] the word is that right could the third
[1:05:09] pull be
[1:05:10] on what if it
[1:05:13] is look at the scripture piled in here
[1:05:16] could it
[1:05:17] be is the third pull to preach the
[1:05:20] Eternal Doom that's rejected the message
[1:05:22] of Salvation well you say the church is
[1:05:24] going yeah they will we'll go right on
[1:05:26] just the same but remember all this time
[1:05:28] Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed
[1:05:31] with Christ the last members been
[1:05:33] redeemed the six seal has produced
[1:05:35] itself the seventh seal brings them back
[1:05:37] to Earth the lamb come and took the book
[1:05:39] out of the right hand of him and set
[1:05:41] down claimed what he owed what he had
[1:05:44] redeemed is that right so it's always
[1:05:47] been that third pool right Jesus speaks
[1:05:51] in the scripture going out into the
[1:05:52] highways and byways compel them draw
[1:05:54] them to come what is the pull it's an
[1:05:56] attraction it's a
[1:05:58] drawing and yet there is a all that are
[1:06:03] bidden all that maybe the invitation
[1:06:06] seems to go out to the calling uh uh
[1:06:10] that that that may be sent out not all
[1:06:13] are
[1:06:14] chosen but yet the call is
[1:06:17] given and then this gospel cry from
[1:06:21] these
[1:06:22] Epistles the word of God being lived
[1:06:25] draws the chosen into
[1:06:30] Mercy but the non-elect will push it
[1:06:33] away into
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:37] judgment you say the third pull it's
[1:06:40] using a a message language we talk about
[1:06:41] the token we use terminologies that
[1:06:43] message Believers would
[1:06:46] understand if you look at it in the
[1:06:47] scriptural
[1:06:49] sense there's going to become a Time on
[1:06:51] earth when it Narrows down and narrows
[1:06:53] down and there's so many few are that
[1:06:56] are being
[1:06:59] saved and one
[1:07:01] day one day the last one will come
[1:07:06] in and the door will be
[1:07:10] shut but as long as I still see
[1:07:13] healing as long as I still see Souls
[1:07:17] being dealt with I say Lord let's keep
[1:07:20] the door open as much as we
[1:07:22] can Lord let there be room for mercy
[1:07:26] and it'll be that Mercy that they
[1:07:29] reject cuz that was his third pull was
[1:07:33] mercy and that's what was rejected
[1:07:35] because once Mercy is spurned there's
[1:07:37] nothing left but judgment but God will
[1:07:40] never judge someone without
[1:07:42] first sending
[1:07:45] mercy God help us in this end time I
[1:07:48] feel that in my heart the way that I
[1:07:50] wanted to present this was more from the
[1:07:52] sense of could it be but I I I I don't
[1:07:56] want I'm not trying to hide the ball but
[1:07:58] let me just say that you you can be an
[1:08:02] Abraham you could be the one that's
[1:08:04] sighing and crying you could be the one
[1:08:06] that say oh God once more Lord be
[1:08:13] merciful may God deal with our hearts
[1:08:17] our homes may we as a church be a place
[1:08:20] of his Mercy could we stand together and
[1:08:23] pray this morning
