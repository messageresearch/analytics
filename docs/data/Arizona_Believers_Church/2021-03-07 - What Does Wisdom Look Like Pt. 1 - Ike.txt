TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hallelujah hallelujah that's all we need to be in a heavenly place is his presence amen we rejoice in that it's the voice his voice that declares his presence it says in the garden that they fled god was walking and they fled from the presence of the lord and what was declaring his presence him crying out adam or arthur what a privilege this morning to be gathered into his presence you could take your bibles we'd like to read from hebrews chapter 4 and we'll read verses 9 to 16 and then and we're just going to jump right into it today and take this beginning with hebrews chapter 4 and my my title is what does wisdom look like and i want to say this at the outset that um i'd been pondering to preach um i've been looking at james in the book of james where it says that the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable and it lists all these characteristics of wisdom and how that is very practical what james is teaching us as you even would just you could take time to read the entire book of james it wouldn't take very long and just see what how james is expressing faith the expression of faith and how wisdom is expressed and wisdom from above and how the rest is such an important part of this the practical outcome of wisdom when you have wisdom there's a rest that comes with it and and it just felt zeroed in and got zeroed into where today without even getting into the subject of rest and maybe touching on it some i want to look at how the word is what wisdom looks like wisdom looks like christ christ is the wisdom of god so real wisdom will always align with the word and be reflective of the word so that's our that's our focus but i want to at the beginning talk a little bit about rest and in hebrews chapter four he's actually expressing that he fears uh or he said let us therefore fear he's expressing to everyone let us be concerned and conscious that that we do not fall short of entering into his promise of rest so he says in verse 9 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than the two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of joints and moral and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened under the eyes of him with whom we have to do sin then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession and notice this follows this very outstanding verse to us that we're all very familiar with now that the word of god is a discerner it's sharp it's like a sword and this this is kind of like the hub of god talking about rest paul talking about rest and entering into that rest and then he talks about the word being a discerner and now he's talking about we have a high priest who can be touched and this word this discerning word is right at the center of this rest and this one to whom we can go to who can be touched for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was at all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly that boldly there does not pres mean presumptuously or arrogantly or come in loudly but actually means coming honestly to be frank to be honest we're coming boldly saying hey i'm needy i don't have what i what it takes let us therefore come honestly boldly under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need if we could pray together heavenly father as we are gathered together in your presence today we feel that presence and our faith is so energized already and we're finding that we're able to reach out and to believe that all things are possible to lay aside our human instinct to say well this is that and that's that and this has happened and that's happened and it seems like that we're so good at reasoning our way out of a miracle reasoning our way out of a deliverance and reasoning in our way out of a healing the lord with this sense of your presence we've laying those things aside and laying our reasonings aside and we're feeling that the divine is with us and that where you are all things are possible so i pray father that you come and you do something supernatural now you do something that sets at liberty hearts that you come and you do it only you can and that's change the life permanently so we ask father that you come and change us from the inside out speak to us in a powerful way take this word and use it for your glory in the name of lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you can be seated we do want to welcome all the visitors that we have with us and different ones we also have the stefans visiting from texas so god bless you we welcome them it's nice to see our friends here with us this morning so i'm going to just jump right into this our title is what does wisdom look like and kind of uh and i'm wanting to use the word as maybe an answer to that or a subtitle and remember that these very verses we just read that bring into this that just begin to describe the word as being a discerner it being quick and powerful it's said in relation to us being mindful of not failing to enter into that resonances and laboring to enter interest and how that we have a high priest that we can go to so this is where the subject is wisdom and how wisdom will bring a rest but we've got to find that faith's final resting place is in the word of god that when you hear the word of god if it's not mixed with faith and and those two elements do not come together then you're really just on your own now in genesis chapter 3 verse 6 we've been looking at this through several months so i know that you are familiar with the details having already been faithfully taught through the years but then also it being recently expressed to us that the serpent beguiles eve and speaks to eve in such a way to cause her to see the tree of knowledge of good and evil differently than how god had described him god had said if when you eat it you're going to die the serpent began to say well no god lied to you said you wouldn't die but when you eat it when you partake of it you'll become as god's knowing good from evil you're going to have this ability to discern and in verse 6 it says and the woman saw when the woman saw so this is something in her perception has changed had you asked her before what do you see when you see the tree of knowledge of good and evil she'd say well i see the potential for death i see that god told us not to eat it but now her perception has changed she's looking at it differently and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree desired to make one wise so what was it she was promised she was promised wisdom she was promised insight and some sort of acumen with certain things and an ability and so this is what she sees she sees the potential of wisdom in partaking of this tree she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under her husband with her and he did eat so her perception changes her feelings change it even says that she saw the tree as pleasant to the eyes that phrase actually means she was excited within her lust and so it wasn't that she got hungry for something but her lust was excited and it was a tree to be desired to make one wise that means to become prudent to to have to become circumspect to have understanding so something that was going to make her understanding razor sharp and her perception razor sharp and so as she sees this tree as a source of wisdom we could easily say what she saw wasn't true that when she looked at this tree something had changed with her understanding and the bible tells us that she was deceived she was deceived into thinking that this was a good thing to do she was deceived into thinking that if i do this i'll receive wisdom it'll make me better off it'll do something for me enter into a greater promise or greater greater happiness and so what she saw was a false reality she was sold a bill of goods that weren't true she was defrauded it was a it was a con game so she is beguiled and deceived how is she deceived by thinking she sees something that's not actually true and in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 14 paul tells us don't marvel don't be surprised don't be shocked for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light so we could be very hard on the woman and say oh that was so foolish god said this and then that happened and we can make it seem like oh it's just so easy these days to figure out what's right or wrong and we would be uh we wouldn't be very honest would we and we can be very hard on the woman in the beginning who fell and we see that she made a mistake and then adam also followed with her in the mistake though he was not deceived but we have to realize that satan has a very powerful way of putting off something and sharing something and expressing something and presenting something to us that at least initially we might be like oh that sounds good well that sounds right that seems plausible it's because he has the ability to present himself as an angel of light so satan doesn't show up i really wish he did dress all in all red with a pitchfork tail and a pointed tail on a pitchfork because then we'd like ah satan you're trying to trick me and he'd be like ah how'd you know but it doesn't work that way he's transformed into an angel of light therefore we see light we see understanding we see reasoning we see all these certain premises and a case being built we think oh well that seems plausible that seems right that seems very inviting and we have to catch ourselves i realize wait a minute satan has the ability to present himself as an angel of light and having that ability what we need to be able to him having that ability god has granted us the ability to recognize a false light brother brandon made this statement he said the powers of satan are many times harder to fight against than it was in any age he has perfected his light presentation he's perfected his light show he can he can uh work work a program and do things and present things in a more powerful way now than he ever has and brother brahma said this is an age of deception it's a great age of deception so satan is working in deception through carnal wisdom and through all sorts of schemes and programs to try to get you to see something the wrong way and if it and i think we should have this appropriate respect for that so that seems very negative well it's not good but it's true it's not good that satan's able to do this but it's true and it's important that we not uh be so to be it's important that we're not ignorant of the fact that satan is like a royal lion who's walking about seeking whom he may devour to consume you and to swallow you up and just accept that that's the reality of the time that we live in it's the reality of the age that we live in it's a very deceitful age and the believer has to be more on his toes now than he was in any age and and that's the reality but if that's the reality on the one hand there's a reality on the other hand wherein god has said because it's going to be the most sinful age it's going to be the most deceitful age because satan has the ability to present himself as an angel of light i'm going to gift you and predestinate you such that you will not fall and so then we're not afraid of being deceived as the bible says in matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect this is something that is an absolute promise that it inoculates us against the deception now that does not mean that we therefore can act foolishly and just take anything we want and go anywhere we want and do whatever we want without the fear of being because we cannot be deceived that that would be foolishness so with this reality that we cannot be deceived what we then need is wisdom to do the right thing not because we're afraid to be just we're going to be deceived but wisdom to do the right thing and not plunge headlong into something well i can't be deceived so i'm just going to go ahead and do this but have the wisdom to know is this the right thing to do i'm not afraid of being deceived but lord is this the right thing to do so the power over deception is this gift of wisdom this gift of discernment that god gives to his children he grants this to his children and james chapter one we've been reading verse five i want to read to verse eight and if you do take time you can go and read just the few chapters the several chapters of the book of james and i think it would be beneficial to you just to kind of catch these several different statements that he makes that just are woven through the um the book it says if any of you lack wisdom this is this prudence this intelligence this ability to discern let him ask god that giveth to all men liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him verse six but let him ask in faith so there's uh i i guess this is just me me saying this so if you want to put on the side my initials off to the side if you write this down and i i try to i i my daily job am i nine to five or whatever you want to call it my full-time job uh to make a living i do this to make a leaving you know i practice law to make a living i'm literally paid every day to give my opinion and so i'm glad i get paid to give my opinion six days a week or seven days a week in that job because i can't give my opinion in this one and so i get it out during the week so i'm not i don't want to give my opinion but in this when he says but let him ask in faith he it's it's almost as if he's saying now just not anybody can read that and say hey god give me wisdom they're going to become the wisest man in the room the the request has to be made in faith so just nobody can take this scripture and say oh well god says to give me faith hey ask for faith hey give it to me give it to me give it to me he says but let him ask in faith and you'll find that he's dealing with this uh this asking in faith and asking amiss throughout this book for the next few chapters but let him ask in faith nothing wavering in hebrews chapter 4 when he's talking about failing to enter into rest he says the gospel was preached but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith with them that heard it and since it wasn't mixed with faith they did not enter into rest but those who believed enter into rest so it's not just hearing and acknowledging but it has to be mixed with faith to draw the believer into rest why because you're resting by faith not in circumstance not in your own wisdom not in your own ability to figure it out says but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the lord if he's doubtful if he doesn't believe if he's just doing it well the bible says if i ask i get it if he's real maybe i'll get it saying that this man who's wavering and tossed around don't think that you're going to get the wisdom you ask for and don't think you're going to get anything you ask for if you're not asking in faith verse 8 a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways the one who asks must first believe that he is he must believe in whom he's asking he has been saved by grace through faith so faith is a part of his experience he has this faith in god he can take and say lord i lack wisdom i need wisdom and he can ask in faith not wavering believing that god is going to grant him and give him this wisdom and so james when he says if any man lack wisdom ask god but this is based upon some understanding that there's a faith in god there's a conviction that god is right there's a belief in his word for a double-minded man this phrase double-minded man it means a doubter as he's already said it's a waver it's somebody with divided loyalties so they're unsure they're uncommitted well you give me wisdom but i've got these other contingencies well i'm just not so sure that the word has all my answers or whatever the whatever the contingency may be but there's another backup plan or there's some sort of divided loyalties or there's not a full selling out saying you know what i believe that god knows i trust god i'm surrendered to him i'm accepting his mind so the double-minded man it's i and i just feel very very focused to express this and and do it very succinctly and not spend much time on this a double-minded man is not the believer who's filled with the holy ghost who wrestles with temptations and doubt that's not the double-minded man because the believer who has the holy ghost and who struggles with questions and different things is not unstable in all his ways just has areas in his life that he needs to surrender more and god to come on the scene and make make better but a double-minded man wants to be religious on one hand wants to follow the lord wants to love the lord on one hand but prefers the world and the things of the world on the other that's the double-minded man the double-minded man is the man who says in his mind well i love god i think this is the truth i want to serve the lord but on the other hand starts rationalizing well i don't know if i like what servant lord looks like or i really love this and i really love that and this new album is going to drop or this new movie's coming out in this series and and they start thinking what's going to happen if i give my heart to lord i have to give up this it's just the game that we start doing inside our head that's a double-minded man and a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways if he thinks he wants to serve god but really loves the world more he's not going to find stability in either walk in either endeavor you're going to be miserable when he's sinning he's going to be miserable when he goes to church but that's the double-minded man he's unstable in all his ways he's he has a he may profess christ but not being born again he's unable to be settled because that word unstable in all his ways it means restless in everything he thinks feels and decides a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways if he has this well i want to serve god and i want to do the right thing but i really love these other things he's going to be not find rest and contentment when he he's doing these things that he still likes it's his unstableness in all his ways he's restless and everything he thinks feels and decides he lacks peace he lacks contentment he lacks rest a double-minded man is unstable he lacks rest so a double-minded man is not born ag is is not born again so when we the bible speaks of a double-minded man who's not at rest he's talking about somebody he's not talking about a born-again christian who struggles with worldliness but he's talking about someone who lacks a birth that's what the bible is teaching us that a double-minded man who's unstable in all his ways he lacks a birth so james says in james chapter 4 verse 8 draw an eye to god and he will draw night to you cleanse your hands ye sinners purify your hearts ye double-minded so the double-minded are the the sinners it's the it's it's those whose hearts have not been purified through the baptism of the holy ghost this is who he's talking to he says the double-minded man is unstable in all his ways the person who in his mind says well i love god i love the word i love the message i want to serve god but i really love this and i really love that and i'm not so sure i want to i struggle with this or this is who i am whatever that battle is that creates the lack of rest the restlessness and the instability throughout that person's entire life and so they can't find the joys we're saying in a moment they can't find the joy in the world that they really want to get out of it because they have this other part of their mind that says well is that really who you are and what you really want to do and don't you really want to serve the lord and it's this battle in the mind that's the double-minded man now there's a beautiful part about being being the elect of god the devil fights against us when we're in the world and we feel that wow you know i i can't really find full happiness and joy while i'm out in the world but when i go to church i'm a hypocrite because i'm sinning and i'm doing this and i'm doing that but let me tell you something it's when you're in the world that you're a hypocrite because down inside of you you're a son or daughter of god and when you're in the world you're testifying that you're not church is the only place you can't be a hypocrite because that you're hearing who you really are you're hearing from where you rarely came from so don't let this whole thing about hypocrisy keep you out of the house of god because it doesn't stop you from going to chipotle right it ain't ever stopped you from going to a restaurant it has never stopped you from going to a grocery store hypocrisy has never stopped you from doing everything else why should it stop you from coming to the house of god saying you know what deep down inside i believe this is who i am this is where i belong and don't let hypocrisy keep you from doing it so draw an eye to god and he will draw an eye to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your heart she double-minded brother braham said don't be double-minded throw your whole life to him and believe him with all your heart that double mindedness speaks of the person who has not fully surrendered and been born again by the holy ghost so the the teachings that james is lifting up are not things that we could just all take and say these are good principles and if we just live by them our lives will be easier this is something that's being spoken to those who have faith this is something that a believer can place before them who's been born again and say as i walk and grow in the grace of god these are things that i can see as evidence of the work of god in my life in james chapter 1 verses 17 to 18 it says if you lack wisdom ask god and so he says every good and every perfect gift is from above later we'll read where he says wisdom from above every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of training there's no darkness in god there's no shadows in god there's no untoward deception there's nothing he's doing where he's hiding himself to deceive you there's nothing there's no darkness there's no evil there's no shadow there's full light and illumination in him and if you receive wisdom from him this is not a dark wisdom this isn't a a dark art this is something that is true and pure of his own will be he us with the word of truth that we could be a kind of first fruits of his creatures let him ask in faith not wavering this is the one whose mind has been purified this is one whose hands who have been cleansed he have been born again by the word of god being born again by the word of god the double mind has been defeated now we may still doubt we may still wrestle but you're not unstable in all your ways because you have some anchor on the inside of you and we've all can testify to this who've been born again that we have patches in our lives where it just feels like we go into a tailspin but guess what at some point the traction control of the holy ghost gets us and catches us and keeps us from hitting the ditch and we when we get back on the straight and narrow what is that that's the word of god being birthed in our hearts being born again by the word of truth that double mind has been defeated so we're not restless and unstable in all our ways and therefore we can ask with faith for wisdom we can ask god for guidance and as you read the book of james and we're not going to do it this morning at least i don't think we are i might do it this afternoon 1201 turn to james chapter 1 verse 1. but if you as you read it you'll find that james is placing wisdom as the crown in consummation of the character of the true believer that's taking wisdom and he's placing this is where this is where the believer really shines this is where the proof of a believer is made manifest is when they act in wisdom and they display themselves in wisdom because james is going to teach us that wisdom acts there's a saying that says it's better to be stay quiet and be perceived as a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt and so wisdom acts even if it doesn't act it's acting wisdom will constrain conduct wisdom will close the mouth wisdom will cause you to say and do things but wisdom is something that acts it's not silent it's not ineffective it's not just a it's something that's lazy without power but wisdom acts and when james is lifting up wisdom he's talking about something more than just knowledge to the jews it meant something that had a broader range of thought a more direct influence upon character than just knowing something that this this wisdom was something that impacted thought process this wisdom was something that impacted actions that if it changed your thought process then it would change your language it would change the way you talk if it impacted your thought process and had a much broader range of thought then it would change the way you conduct yourselves so the wisdom is something more than just knowing something it's a broader range of that that influences the character of a true believer and the conduct of a true believer in james chapter 2 verse 18 yeah a man may say thou hast faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i will show thee my faith by my works somebody may say well i have faith and i don't have works but faith is what matters and faith is what's important and as long as i have faith i'm doing good but we're taught that works is faith expressed that if you say that you have faith and don't have any works it's vanity james says you're a dead man you don't have any life in it and he's teaching us that abraham's faith was reached its full and supreme expression when he acted when he did something that even to the world may seem crazy god promised you a son you finally get the son and now you're telling me that god told you to sacrifice the son and so you're going to go offer up your son upon the altar into the world that's crazy that's insane but to god that was perfect faith because abraham was willing to demonstrate that my faith is so strong that i can actually take this one that was promised to me and do what god said knowing that he's obligated to raise him up he's obligated to do it i know he's going to do it i i know this because we've had a conversation and he told me that it would be this seed through which all the this promise to me and i'd be a father of many nations is going to come so he says i and the lad will return we're going to come back and god provided and that's how his faith reached that's full of supreme expression and james is saying that you can say that you have faith but i will show you my faith by my works i'll show you that i have wisdom by the fruits of wisdom you'll be able to witness wisdom by how it works out in my life matthew 11 19 the son of man came eating and drinking and they say they were criticizing john the baptist had a lot of nasty things to say about him and now they have a lot a lot of nasty things to say about the son of man and that's why it shouldn't bother you if they have a lot of nasty things to say about you the title my working title what i thought i was going to preach this morning is getting beneath and living above because if you're ever going to help somebody you have to get beneath them but in order to get beneath them you have to be living above everything else all the criticisms what everybody else has to say the way they characterize what you do don't worry about faith is what matters you know you're doing the will of god stay the course perhaps they may be doing the will of god by running their mouths they may be doing what god asked them to do speak evil of them okay i'll do that and they may just be doing what they're asked just like that prophet one time a young prophet was told you go and prophesy and you come back and don't you stop for nothing or you'll die young man went out and did exactly what god told them to do as he's returning he was met by another prophet an old prophet who had been told by god to stop the young prophet and get him off task and so the old prophet says why don't you come and terry with me and dying and have a meal he said oh well no i've been told to do this i've been told to do this he's like oh well you know what it's okay god told me to stop you what'd he do he stopped and god took his life because one can do what they're supposed to do and and everything be okay as long as you do what you're supposed to do and so the criticism shouldn't stop you the negative things shouldn't stop you we can live above that in order to get beneath somebody else and help them and so he's saying that the son of man comes eating and drinking i say behold a gluttonous and wine bibber friend republicans and sinners he says but wisdom is justified over children this is a phrase that says true wisdom is shows itself by its works foolishness is made manifest in the criticism of the son of man foolishness is made manifest in the one who's doing what god asked him to do foolishness is made manifest and those that rant and rail and criticize and draw their swords against another brother that's foolishness that's child's play that that doesn't edified or do anything and he's saying listen that kind of foolishness you can discern but wisdom is justified over children those who take wisdom will enjoy the fruits of wisdom those who are born by the word of god will enjoy the benefits of the word of god those who have wisdom wisdom is justified of her children the proof is in the pudding meaning when you eat it that's the proof you have the pudding it's in the eating thereof and that's what it's being said about wisdom wisdom is justified over children those who are born and animated and lived by wisdom are the proof that it is wisdom so true wisdom shows itself by what it does what it says and what it does we're asking the question what does wisdom look like we have a couple of poster boards in our homeschool room that says uh what does respect look like and when what does respect sound like because you want to know what it looks like and what it sounds like so you can learn what respect is we want to know what wisdom looks like so we can know whether or not we have wisdom and we're exercising wisdom and first corinthians chapter 1 verses 18 to 25 he said for the preacher of the cross is to them that perish foolishness so we don't cause pre we don't say preaching is foolishness because it's only foolishness to those who don't believe in the preaching of the cross to those that perish so when we say the foolishness of preaching we're saying that's what the world calls it for the preacher the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god the preaching of the gospel is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and i will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent this is those who are wise and their own conceits these are those that are wise in their own uh intellect and their own carnal ability i'm going to destroy that i'm going to turn it i'm going to bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent those who are skilled in worldly affairs and politics and whatever else those are the ones that are going to be turned upside down by my wisdom where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom not the right kind of wisdom this is the sophist this is the the the intellectual debate but we preach christ crucified and this christ that's preached is unto the jews a stumbling block who wanted a sign but are stumbled by it and under the greeks foolishness who want wisdom but here's the personification of it but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god so christ is the power of god christ is the wisdom of god christ the word the logos is the wisdom of god what does the word look like the wisdom look like it looks like the word what is the word the word is christ christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men this is what wisdom looks like christ the power of god christ the wisdom of god set against foolishness set against worldly things set against carnal things set against things that just relate to the intellect of a man and the feelings of a man and how a man is made to think and how amanda is made to feel by his own feelings so wisdom as it says christ is the power and wisdom god this speaks of discernment this is talking about understanding christ is the power of god and the wisdom of god this is something that we can only have this kind of wisdom is something we can only have through the word kind of wisdom that we're talking about the kind of wisdom that james says if you lack wisdom ask god when he says ask god for wisdom it's not the wisdom that god destroys he says let us it destroys the wisdom of the wise and the understanding of the prudence that's not what we're wanting listen we're not wanting to know when to jump in and out of bitcoin right if you do that you're going to go crazy and so we're not wanting wisdom on how to play the stock market well should i move everything right now into bonds or i want to have wisdom to know the right way to swing a softball bat all right that's the kind of wisdom we want we want the wisdom to know what's right and wrong we want to know the wisdom to know what's best i mean we ought to be maturing to a place where this is good this is good this is better this is better and we ought to have a desire in our heart to where good becomes better and better becomes best that there's things in my life that yes things are good and things are getting better but lord at the end of the day what i want is very good as god came to his conclusion very good at rest at peace this is the best that's what we're striving for and we can only find that through christ the word ephesians 1 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ this is paul's prayer now the god of our lord jesus christ the father glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him through the knowledge of him and knowing him you can have you have now a spirit of wisdom and a spirit of revelation through the knowledge of the more that you come to know him the more you fall in love with him the more revelation and wisdom you have practical wisdom practical discernment practical revelation it really honestly at the end of the day does us no good to be able to chart and diagram all the scriptures and properly place every single mystery and it not make a difference in your life you're not able to to to love your spouse you're not able to raise your children the correct way you're not able to be honest with work you're not able to to to be honest with your fellow brother really at the end of the day how could you ever make the argument that that's real wisdom from above that this is the real life of christ if it's not making a difference in every phase of your life the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him in colossians 3 16 cortana christ the word is what brings us this wisdom let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom that's what that's the rich i want that's the riches i want to have that i'm dwelling in your heart richly in all wisdom so it's the word that'll make us wise it's the word that strengthens our discernment it's the word that gives us the ability to recognize what's better and what's best it's the word that can guide us in difficult situations through our growing faith in jesus christ as our faith grows and as our faith is increasing in jesus christ so does our discernment grow so does our wisdom grow paul writes to timothy in 2 timothy chapter 3 verses 15 to 17 and that from a child he's speaking specifically to timothy how he had been taught the scriptures and faithfully taught by his mother and his grandmother and from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus why are the scriptures able to make you wise unto deliverance through your faith in jesus christ and by having faith in jesus christ the word is able to increase your understanding and increase your knowledge it's able to make you wise unto full deliverance under full salvation unto full um wholeness and completeness of mind and body scripture is able to make thee wise into salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works what's the practical outcome of faith being active within someone's life they are thoroughly furnished thoroughly furnished unto good works they have the they have the fruit or the evidence they have a life wisdom acts so faith is active i'll show you my faith by my works is what james is saying that the faith i have is going to manifest itself in practical action practical thought in the right things to say and the right things to do i'd like to expand it even further this morning but i'll just make reference to it the bible says walk in wisdom towards them that are without meaning we must walk wisely towards those who are not christians to those who are outside the body of christ to those who believe not because your actions your attitude the way you think the way you act is going to be reflective of the word of god reflective of what you believe and you want to be in a position to help but then also the world is going to be less forgiving than your brother should be would be at least that's what paul thought when he wrote it nowadays it seems like your brother in christ is harder on you than your neighbor but really that's what he's saying hey if you if you make a mistake and you stumble your brother knows what you're going through your fellow sister those who believe with you they know hey things are hard it's okay let's keep going if you lack a little bit of wisdom there's forgiveness there and they're able to forgive adapt and overcome they're able to just take it say you know what the people have weaknesses things happen and your brother will do that but the world isn't able to do that and is not always willing to do that so it says you got to walk in wish you got to display yourself with a certain character a certain attitude certain mindset that the way you talk the way you walk the way you live you have to use wisdom in the way that you're acting and so the word is able to make us wise and says the bible is profitable for doctrine we prove correction instruction and righteousness if you have faith in jesus christ if you have faith in jesus christ in colossians chapter 2 verses 1 to 4 for i would that you knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts this is his burden this is his conflict that their hearts might be comforted and being knit together in love unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ and whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words his burden for those at colossia his burden for those them at laodicea is that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and through the comfort of the holy ghost through the word that be in their bond that they would grow into he says all riches of the full assurance of understanding so understanding then has a full assurance that comes with it understanding has a fullness of riches that comes with it this is why understanding is so important that if you have full understanding it brings full assurance if you have full understanding it brings the fullness of riches so as your understanding increases there's an increase of your fullness there's an increase of of assurance there's an increase of riches that's the kind of wealthy i want to be that's the portfolio that i just i want to see going straight up is my portfolio of understanding because with it a greater assurance with it a greater a greater um greater riches of assurance to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god this word acknowledgement is more it has more force than just knowledge but it's unto a greater and more perfect knowledge of the mystery of god a greater and more perfect knowledge of the mystery of god it says in whom speaking of christ and of the father and of christ the mystery of god unto the father and of christ in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge in christ is hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and wisdom and knowledge being used together in this instance is speaking of the mind of god it speaks of a knowledge that god has it speaks of a wisdom that god has it's not speaking of anything natural or anything that would be part of our base instincts as a man it's in the in whom and christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in jesus christ so who do you want to go to to get wisdom christ who do you need a revelation of a knowledge of in order to have wisdom and all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge you need to go to christ wisdom and knowledge speak of the mind of god god is the master of all intelligence there's no one smarter than him i had a brother tell me one time he's a pastor on the east coast that when he began to serve the lord he was they were singing that song we know it to be our god rings he had both hands lifted up in the air singing he i believe he heard somebody else singing it was what it was he walked by a brother on the front row is kind of a new convert and they were on the front row and they had both arms up they're saying i've got brains and i think i think the understanding was since they served god they had came to the lord they had to be kind of they had to be pretty sharp to do them but if we say our god reigns and our gods got brains too he's the master of all intelligence no one's smarter him than no one's going to outsmart him no one's going to trick him no one's going to pull one over on him he's the master of all intelligence and he says this if you look at verse 4 again i say that lest any man should beguile you with enticing words i say this because men would want to deceive you with philosophy and subtle reasoning and since it's not an innocent world and it's a great age of deception and because men would want to deceive you and mislead you through philosophy and subtle reasoning what i want for you to pray for is that as your hearts are being knit together in love that you would receive the full assurance and the full riches of understanding by unknowing the mystery of god that through the revelation of the word of god that your understanding would be enriched and increased and you would come to a place where you're able to say wait a minute i'm being misled my feelings are leading me down the wrong path i'm coming under a particular feeling or emotion that i know is trending towards something that's negative and you can recognize that say no no i don't want to do that so i'm even placing in the context to where we're not able to deceive ourselves because our emotions can deceive us so that would deceive you with enticing words it's a false premise that's not easily discovered it's an enticing word because there's a part to it that seems that seems reasonable it's something that's not easily discovered so that if one is unwise they can be carried away into air understanding and acknowledgement of the mystery is important when trying to defend against these subtle the subtle reasonings in philosophy there was a a priest i think it was in the 1500s that made this statement the subtlety of human reasonings has always been the stumbling block of faith the subtlety of human reasoning has always been the stumbling block of faith we can say we could say it's possible with god this is impossible or this is possible god can do this but then we begin to talk about all the reasons why he won't or all the reasons why he can't this is what we're praying for this is what we want this is what we believe god should do for us but then we begin to talk about all the reasons why it's not possible we i could even say honestly as we desire to have a church building and we're not just trying to rack up hilton honors points we want to have a permanent church building and we could look at a facility and it's easy to start giving all the reasons why this isn't going to work instead of saying you know what if god wants us to have this then there's no good reason we shouldn't have it it doesn't it doesn't matter how much or it doesn't matter where it doesn't all these different things that matter if this is an opportunity that god presents and wants to provide then we shouldn't come up with a list of reasons why he shouldn't or a list of reasons why we don't or list of reasons why we can't i remember when we were trying to find a house to move here and start this church we couldn't find anything and so we had a budget we had a cap well when we couldn't find a place um find a house at that budget i said there's no budget search up to ten thousand dollars a month whatever it takes find a house if god wants me there he'll give me enough money to make rent and i found a house within our budget as soon as i did that but my attitude was i can't start keep putting god in a box and say it has to be this way it has to be that way lord you have to open a door i want to stop constraining you so lord if you're wanting me to live in something that's way way way be beyond my means then you're gonna have to give me the means to meet it and he would have given me the means before i accepted it because i don't know if that would have been real wise to sign a ten thousand dollar month lease they probably wouldn't have let me i mean let's just use some practical sense there but we were trying why because we didn't want to say no to something that god had for us but the subtlety of human reasoning has always been the stumbling block of faith but the mystery of jesus christ holds the treasures of all wisdom and knowledge what happened in the beginning is that god's word was swapped for wisdom and what's happened with man throughout all the ages as they swapped the wisdom of god they swapped the word of god for the man's wisdom and the culture of man they swap it for politics they swap it for pretest they swap it for for money for popularity but the mystery of jesus christ the word of god holds the treasures of all wisdom and knowledge brother branham preaches christ as the mystery god revealed in light of the fact that man has gone to the carnal side and even in religion has gone to the natural things and the culture of man and they've swapped out the wisdom of the word he said that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery has to be unfolded it's it's not it's not some kind of theological event that the theologians can all excite each other about at a minister's meeting it's something that's so real and so practical the significance that the the coming of the lord had with dying for our sins and making a way that we could become redeemed sons and daughters of god god making himself known through his word and breaking the shackles of denominationalism and breaking the shackles and the chains of traditions and man's ideas is just a significant end that it takes the the potential of salvation and brings it to a fullness that he's no longer restrained the power of christ is no longer restrained by men's ideas and politics so we talk about the seven seals being open this isn't this isn't the book of revelation that's been very mysterious and probed at and misunderstood and everyone's trying to figure it out it's not it's not a chalkboard session it's something that becomes very real to the individual where christ is no longer fettered in your life the word is no longer restrained you can say god give me everything you want to give me knowing that you're living in a time where there's nothing holding it back first corinthians chapter two verses four to eight he says and and if you recall we've already read from chapter one he says in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words so i'm not just using cute phrases and i'm not using convincing speech in man's wisdom and a premise that's false but presented in a way that convinces you i'm not doing that but i come my speech is in demonstration of the spirit and the power now the demonstration of the spirit and the power was in his speech and preaching his speech and preaching were not was not enticing words or were not enticing words but his speech and preaching were a demonstration of the spirit and power of god that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of god that's where our faith should stand in the power and wisdom of god christ who is the wisdom and the power of god how be it we speak wisdom so if the wisdom is not consigned to the world the world's got all the wisdom and we're all the fools no he speaks of wisdom we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world or the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world and to our glory the wisdom of god is a mystery the wisdom of god is hidden it's hidden from the wise and prudent of the world it's revealed unto babes it's not something that everyone can just look at and grasp and make use of but the real treasures and riches of the wisdom and knowledge of god are hid in christ and can be only known as god grants them and gives them paul demonstrates that even in this book as he writes and then also maybe in the second corinthians how that it's the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god and we can know the things that are freely given by god through his spirit he wants to give unto us his wisdom though it's a mystery though it's hidden he wants to give it to us by his spirit it's a wisdom that's ordained before the foundational world for our glory this is a wisdom that's for our glory which none of the princes of this world knew what did they not know they didn't know that christ was the power and wisdom of god because they had they known christ and the power of wisdom that he held had they known what his purpose was they wouldn't they would not have crucified the lord of glory this wisdom that we're asking god for the the the wisdom that we desire the wisdom that we crave the wisdom that we need paul is saying there's a mystery the wisdom of god in a mystery the hidden wisdom which was in god before the world began this mystery was first deep in god's heart it was in the back part of god's mind it was his secret counsel it was his hidden purpose even as paul is saying it was so deep in god's mind that when he sent his son they had no idea that he was going to be a sacrifice there there wasn't people weren't sitting back going all right watch this watch this he's got he has to be baptized because sacrifices need to be cleansed now watch this he's going to be hated they're going to turn their backs on no one was reading the script knowing that he was going to have to be crucified and you really want the proof of it he's telling his disciples over and over again the son of man's gonna be persecuted and he's gonna have to die and he's gonna raise on the third day and they're like yeah whatever sorry jesus even saying ah you know peter even saying oh no you can't do this and he said you know satan get thee behind me he was telling them over and over again that this is what i've got to do this is what i've got to do and there's still even his own disciples weren't didn't have the knowledge of the hidden wisdom be like well wait a minute of course yeah that makes perfect sense that's what the bible says you're going to be like a lamb led to the slaughter that's the things that we know is going to happen that is not the reality of everyone then it was a hidden wisdom it was a hidden council and i that that should cause us to say lord in my own personal life if you can have a divine will and counsel that's hidden that causes people to act in a certain way against your will then lord give me an understanding of what your will is for my life so that i don't act in fighting against it peter without wisdom drew his sword to defend jesus christ but in defending jesus christ he was hindering prophecy he drew a sword in defense of christ we ought to defend jesus christ the name of jesus there's no other name given in earth under heaven whereby men can be saved and we draw our swords in defense of jesus christ to lift up jesus christ but then we begin to use the sword in such a way to fight against the very bride of jesus christ fight against the very word of jesus christ fight against the very prophecy of jesus christ in the time that you're living in and that's because you lack wisdom i say you all say me that's because we we lack wisdom when we do that and so this mystery is first hidden deep in god's heart it's a hidden council hidden purpose then it's hidden in christ who's the mystery of god and whom the revelation of all wisdom unfolds that's who you need the revelation of this was a statement i read about christ who is the treasure of all wisdom and knowledge and i believe it was a statement by the same priest who said that the subtlety of human reasonings has always been the stumbling block of faith hundreds of years ago he said jesus christ is a great book he can indeed he who can he who can indeed study him in the word of god will know all he ought to know humility opens this divine book faith reads in it love learns from it christ is a book he's sealed he's closed off he's unknown but humility can open that book faith can read that book love will learn from that book and if you study him you'll know all you need to know in proverbs chapter 2 verses 1 to 9. just think of how practical this is my son if thou will receive my words and hide my commandments with thee so that thou incline thy ear into wisdom and apply thy heart to understanding yea if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver in searches for her as for hid treasures i realize that when we read the proverbs in our minds we begin to picture cobblestones and stone castles and and chariots and maybe horse-drawn carts and different things and wearing leather sandals and wearing robes and and we just think about the wisdom of the of the other of the times past and maybe we're not just and maybe it just seems so far beyond this but this is very very practical what the proverbs is telling us that we ought to say we have to receive the word of god hide it in our hearts be more inclined to hear the wisdom of god be more inclined to spiritual things to apply our hearts not just to say that we believe it but to desire to understand it and cry for knowledge pray for revelation more than anything and seek her seek that as choice silver just as much as you would chase after a paycheck just as much as you chased after chase after a new contract or a new opportunity search for her as hid treasures then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord i hope that through even just the service this morning that this wisdom can become more practically within your grasp and find the knowledge of her thou thou shalt understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god for the lord giveth wisdom how out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding the lord gives wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yea every good path this is this is the path to peace we get we get riled up a lot with inequities and things that are unfair but when you can come to a place of understanding righteousness judgment and equity then you're in a place of stability you're in a place to where when you see something that's inequitable you know one who can make it right when you see an injustice you can understand the reasons behind it then thou shalt understand righteousness and judgment equity yea every good path for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding jesus when he was tempted in the wilderness of the devil who had not eaten bread for 40 days he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god according from deuteronomy i believe 8 3 saying man shall not live by bread alone but by but shall live by every word of god that proceeds out of his mouth it's telling us that the word of god is what comes out of his mouth the lord gives wisdom out of his mouth comes the word out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding which you can live by you can take that to the bank that's something you can live by that's something you can count on that's something you can trust in you can live by the word that proceeds out of the mouth of god in second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 8 i want him to amplify this thought that wisdom comes out of his mouth the word comes out of his mouth knowledge and understanding comes out of his mouth then shall that wicked one be revealed the wicked one this antichrist this deceiver whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth what is it that comes out of his mouth the word of god its knowledge and understanding its wisdom it shall consume the wicked one and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming this speaks to the power that the word of god has over the deceiver regardless of where you would want to place this with respect to prophecy and when this is going to be fulfilled the power and potential of the word of god is yours right now to rebuke the devourer to overthrow the consumer and to stop satan and all his nasty tricks in any way that he would want to defile your understanding to cause you to doubt to weaken your faith or make a mistake because it's the word of god which comes out of his mouth that destroys the power of the wicked that exposes them the wicked is exposed the trail of the serpent is exposed his schemes are overthrown his nasty tricks are made known to us we realized oh by the word of god that came out of his mouth i can see that he's exposed in what he's trying to do i know that may seem to be super spiritual but i trust you can in your own life think of an instance where it's very practical very practical he destroys the powers of satan through his the brightness of his coming in christ is the mystery god revealed it says god's great secret of his revelation this great light of revelation has always blinded the wisdom of this world the revelation of jesus christ exposes false wisdom the revelation of jesus christ is the light the brightness of his coming it's what exposes any false path it's what's going to make you aware of anything that has a negative influence anything that can be harmful or destructive god's great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world always has so what secret do you want isn't there something about a secret that when you say hey what's wrong like oh no nothing anyway come on tell me what is it now i don't want to say you've got to tell me as soon as you think there's a secret there's something in you that's kind of like huh what um what is it we want to know we're that way in the natural oh man i wish i could tell you this come on you got you shouldn't have said that right when it says when someone's everyone starts laughing people start laughing and then you're kinda like what wasn't that oh it's an inside joke my response is well then keep it inside it's an inside joke laugh inside it's not fair to the rest of us who think that you're just laughing at us but there's you want in on the secret but there's a secret that's better than anything else this world can tell you you get that somebody tells you oh you're trying to do this you're trying to do that you find the website that's going to um that gives you all the information to solve all your problems secret secret secret great great great you're just this is it honey my whole life is going to be resolved in this you're scrolling through subscribe now at 800 a month and we'll give you the secret and you buy it and it's a six page booklet written by a fifth grader and you've been duped and if we'd spend 800 for a booklet written by a fifth grader how much more should we desire the secrets of god that expose sin that just expose air and even in our own hearts even in our own ambitions even in our own opinions and judgments of others there's attitudes that we hold towards other sons and daughters of god that are not pleasing to god and we need to be let in on the secret of what god sees about them maybe that's a way to do it say lord i don't know what you see in them so tell me what's the secret and if that's what it takes for you to finally start loving your brother and sister start asking god for what he sees in that person brother braham says what was once god's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of christ hallelujah this isn't somewhere way off in in somewhere else we're not having to go to the middle east to find it you don't have to make a pilgrimage to some mecca somewhere you had visit some city or go to some specific church no it has been put in the hearts and minds of the believer fellowship with brother james hayes yesterday congratulations on your retirement and he was sharing with me we were just fellowshipping on certain things he said it was expressing just how this mind of god this wisdom of god is not something you're trying to pull out of heaven but the wisdom from above has been brought down into our hearts we have it it's something that when we're asking god for we're asking for the release of it in our lives don't think of it as something that's foreign to you but think of it says something that you're a part of a network you've been passed into something that you're you're one with that you could say oh god this mystery your secrets your desire what's pleasing to you what means something to you lord it's in my heart there's illumination what is it fulfills ephesians 1 17 the spirit of wisdom and the revelation of knowledge of him it fulfills even paul saying you know when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with i'll behold him as in a glass i'll see him i'll know this is what we have the benefit of of being born by the word of god and growing in his graves it's the spirit of the lord's mouth that destroys the powers of deception it's the spirit of the lord's mouth that destroys reasoning what is it it's the word revelations chapter 1 verse 16 speaking of christ this one who stood standing in the midst of those golden candle sticks he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength this is what is in the midst of the bride now this is what in the midst of the believers now this is what's available to us now it says and his face was shining as the sun and its strength what is that that's the brightness of his countenance that overthrows the wisdom and knowledge of this world it's the brightness of this presence that contrasts and exposes the false light of satan who appears as an angel of light i it's it's in my consciousness so i just feel impressed to say it i know there's a way that the bible can be preached and the word can be preached to recreate this mysterious super-religious superstitious battle between right and wrong and though there are evil forces at work and there's a the force of faith at work we don't need to try to make it into some sort of dungeons and dragons scenario out there or some sort of conspiracy this is a reality in just our everyday life we want to do the things that are pleasing to god and we have a devil that's just sitting there going just pushing at us just needling us just kind of trying to get us to to stop and to turn and to look and so we want god the brightness of his coming the power of his word to expose all these voices all these ideas even the ticking time bomb bombs that have been sewn into us by our past that harness we think back of this situation that situation this circumstance the abuse the decision whatever it might be and we're always just kind of looking back we need the lord to come and just blast through us by his presence in such a way to tear down those things to expose him out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart what is he discussing what is he presenting failure to enter into his rest that's what he's talking about someone failing to enter into rest what is faith anchored in what is this word i'm hearing what does it need to be mixed with it needs to be mixed with faith faith and the word coming together then we have this confidence this boldness that this sharp sword that goes out of his mouth is the word of god the word of god is the wisdom of god is the knowledge of god it is understanding it is it is what goes out of his mouth and will destroy any conspiracy against you any weakness that's been sewn into your flesh any affection that you have in your spirit that drives you to things that you know displease the lord the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword it is out of his mouth goes a two-edged sword it's the sharpest two-edged sword there is that divides between soul spirit and body the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it says the word is quick that means it's alive it's living it has vital power the word is alive it says it's a powerful it's effectual it's active it's quick it's living and it's active i was looking at a an app the other day to count calories and it wanted to know a little bit about yourself so i'm six to 175 pounds and i wanted to know what my lifestyle was and one of them was sedentary and i was like well that that is it you know you know i get up and my my office is in my bedroom right so my commute is i should count the steps i'm pretty sure it's seven glory and i and i sit down and i work all week and then i seven steps on a saturday and i study all and so i don't do a lot of exercise unless i walk to the kitchen to get some water and then my steps are let's see three times seven twenty one and uh it's always like there's this that we could be living but not very active that's my that was my whole point by my google play app search and signing up is we could be living and breathing but not active and the bible does not just say the word is quick which is living and has power but it's also powerful that means it's active energetically efficacious for those who are learning fancy words that's exactly what it is it's energetic and it's efficacious it's effective it works it does its thing it works just as wisdom works the word works why because the word is the wisdom of god in isaiah chapter 55 verses verse 11 it says so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it if god ever speaks to you through the word you can take it to the bank if you ever get the revelation that by his stripes i am healed just bank on it rest in it don't fret don't worry about the the what they what they prescribe you don't worry about what the doctor says if it's ever revealed to you then you rest in that and say i know what god said the word that goes out of his mouth it is the word which is his wisdom i the lord will give wisdom out of my mouth comes knowledge and understanding the word that goes out of my mouth it will it is effective it is energetically efficacious it has vital power it works it'll do what it's supposed to do because it will not come back to me until it's done what i sent it out for if i speak my word to give my believer peace it's not going to come back without them having peace if i speak my word to give somebody deliverance it will not come back to me without giving deliverance if i speak my word to bring rapture power it's not going to reverberate back to me unless it has come to rapturing power it will accomplish that which i please it shall prosper it will be successful in the person to whom i sent it no abundance of words can ever ever ever overestimate the power and might of the word of god there's no amount of words can ever ever overestimate the power of it acts chapter 12 verse 24 but the word of god grew and multiply you want to write another book of acts then the word of god needs to grow and multiply that's the real book of acts the word of god growing and multiplied became more successful and i love the context for these two verses both in chapter 12 and chapter 19. it's used in relationship to all the attempts to fight it all the sermons preached against it all the conspiracies to overthrow it all the lies that were spread about it the word of god grew and multiplied the believers just lived above it and got beneath those that needed it they just kept living their lives they kept going forward and the more that the devil fought against it the more the devil railed the more the foolishness was spouted off about it the more lines they were told about the more the word grew and multiply why they were fighting the word and the the effort against the church the effort to fight the believers the effort to lie about them and malign them and tear them down only made it stronger the word of god grew and multiply why is quick and powerful can't be stopped acts 19 20 so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed it becomes more successful despite everyone's else's efforts to stop it now our efforts will fail but the word will never fail i can make all sorts of promises i can make all sorts of commitments and i can i can say i can do this and i give you my word and that can fail and i can say hey look i give you my word i'm going to wash your car today and someone said well i want to make aaron a liar so they just kidnapped me right throw me in the back of a car and hey i'm sorry i couldn't wash your car somebody kidnapped me but nobody can conspire to keep the word from being fulfilled it's gonna happen it's gonna happen says lord i want it to happen i want it to happen lord i give myself to it a yield to it let the word of god grow mightily and prevail in my life let it prevail the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it's the word that comes out of his mouth it's how god gives wisdom and he says and is a discerner this word discerner relates to judgment it's kritikos relates to some being fit for judging it's skilled in judging it comes from the word critis which means judge the word is the one that passes judgment the word is the one that passes and assess or arbitrates or administers justice in everything what does the word say when you could come to the place where you absolutely believe that whatever god says is true and whatever god does is just you'll find a greater level of contentment and peace in your life you're no longer going to be the place where you're shaking your fist at god because you realize whatever he says is true whatever he does is just and that's why we worship him because there's no one else like that we worship him because he is god we worship him because he is just well is it just that i lost my job if that's what god wants it's justice is it just that the word says this if god said it it's true we worship him because he's god we praise him because he's god we praise him because he's the one true god not because he just loves me if he didn't love me i'd still worship him as god i knew for a fact and he told me aaron i hate you then i would worship him in the truth that he hates me because he's worthy of it because he's god cretaceous the judge the one who passes judgment on everything anything the word is a discerner the word is the judge the word is what determines what is just the word is what determines what is right in a trial the judge is a fact-finder and it's when there's not a jury the jury is a fact-finder in a jury trial they're the ones that determine the facts upon which a decision is going to be made they're the ones that determine whether they believe a witness is telling the truth they're the ones that conclude that this has been properly admitted or that this has been admitted it's been allowed we look at it and we take this as a they're the fact finder in being the fact finder the jury or the judge they're the ones that make the decision the word is the jury the word is the judge there's no other authority there's no higher power than god's word i don't say that too i i i say that maybe with some force but not to be arrogant with it it's the it's the reality that we believe this bible to be god's word we believe the word to be true in god we trust everyone else bring data because we take god at his word we believe in god we trust god in the church age book brother branham's writing in the smyrna and church age he's writing about the new birth now and and he's teaching it very plainly very clearly that the new birth to be born again is to be baptized to be baptized with the holy ghost to be born by the spirit of god and he's explaining how that he believes the new birth is the baptism of the holy ghost but my pentecostal brethren have taken the the birth and they've divided it and they said the ones your birth and the other ones when the holy spirit comes and even and brother branham is trying to explain why this is not true and he's very very deliberate very very plain in the church age book and so he makes this statement what has caused this misunderstanding what's caused this misunderstanding on the word of god he says the answer is experience and he makes this statement we have gone by experience and not the word way away with experience as your measuring line there's only one plumb line only one rod and that is the word plumb line that means you're measuring something right and you're going to use a plumb line if you're trying to square something up want to make sure it's true use a plumb line and build in a wall or turn in a corner do something you want to make sure it's lining up make sure the foundation is straight and so it's something that's useful it's something that's practical and he makes this dichotomy between feelings experience and what the word says and we run up against this a lot in our lives and we need to have the wisdom to know when something's anecdotal and when something's true and somebody else's experience can be true for them but it's anecdotal for you it does not create any kind of principle doesn't create some sort of truth does not establish some sort of rule because there's a lot of people with their experiences and their testimonies and their dreams and their visions and their choices and their lifestyle can express a lot of things that have done a lot of good for you but what you need for you is what's best for you and even all those other things and we could take a lot of anecdotal evidence to build a case that i want to try this and i want to do this to where it doesn't relate to faith but when it comes to the things of god away with experience away with man's opinions away with all those feelings and emotions and back to the word wisdom is not how you feel it's what you know and if you're feeling a little bit of a certain way and you're feeling a lean in a particular way make sure you can get to the place where it anchors and you know this is what god says what does wisdom look like it's the word in action the living word the word living and an action in a bible bride this is the scripture that has been in my notes for every single sermon for the last four or five sermons and i haven't been able to get to it james chapter 3 verse 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show who's wise who's the scribe who's the wise let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom the wise one can show it he's not the wise guy you know the smart aleck but the who's the one that's wise and has wisdom let them show it out of a good a life lived well a good conversation of a good conversation his works with and i love this the meekness of wisdom wisdoms meek wisdom has a particular temperament wisdom has a particular fruit covering that makes the that it becomes attractive so the seed finds the place where it belongs you realize that even with fruit the flat the fruit is the flesh that surrounds the seed and that the fruit is made inviting and the flower the flesh is made inviting and made in a certain way so that it can be picked so that the seed can find good ground and to reproduce the fruit it's the seed in the end that matters because the fruit itself having seed it's made this way so that it's carried off and finds good ground and perpetuates itself and so the wisdom becomes the fruit around the seed the meekness of wisdom is the drawing power is what the proof of the pudding that's when you know it's wisdom is when you see christ in it you show out of a life lived well the meekness of wisdom brother branham says the word of truth was the criterion then this is he's writing down the pergaming church ages is in the church age book there isn't another standard there isn't another plumb line as the world is going to be judged by one christ jesus even so it's going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he's making out let him do as james suggested look into the mirror of god's word that's the only way you'll know if you're overcoming it's the only way you're going to know if it's wisdom is when you first look to the word of god and then you're honest come boldly before the throne of grace to check what your motive and objective we check the word we check our motive and objective what is that going to take it's going to take some meekness real wisdom and grace to navigate that we'll invite the musicians to come as we close the word is the criterion there is not another standard there is not another plumb line it's the word and if you want to know how you're doing just look in the mirror of god's word don't be afraid to do it either chances are you'll see that you're doing good and if you see any area where you're not there's a reflection for you to humble yourself and say lord give me give me what i lack take my hand lead me and guide me it's the word out of his mouth i the lord give wisdom out of my mouth will come knowledge and understanding that sharp two-edged sword which is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it's the believer's rest the word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in a true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on the word of god fill your mouth and heart with it it's never failed it's the truth the word has never failed have we ever failed we had when are you retreat many many many years ago and brother barry coffey asked the question how many of you have lived a sinless life and a young sister sitting away at the front thought he said sinful life but he said sinless life and her hand just went up just in humility my wife sister elizabeth he said sinful and she was like yes lord i've lived a sinful life but we could all say how many of you failed yes lord how many of you have never failed we've all failed but there's one who hasn't he's never failed you yet never will fail you even when you've been disappointed it wasn't his failure he cannot fail he will not fail and the word in the mouth of a believing christian has never failed so what we want to do hold to the word and fill your mouth and your heart with it and paul says to the romans romans chapter 10 verse 8 but wait saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth the word that came out of his mouth is now in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith that we preach i just encourage you today to fill your heart with the word of the lord and as your heart gets full your mouth will get full the more full your heart gets the more full your mouth will get if there's anything lacking in your life let me give you a prescription seek the word of god before you even run after counsel before you even run after a solution here a solution there take time in your own personal life say lord if i'm wanting my life to go in a particular direction i want to be established in your word i want to be a person of faith i realize that i need the presence of god i want to become a christian whatever it is that's in your heart then where you want to start is not opinion not pretense not politics not especially opportunity but lord i want to come to your word and i want to seek your word and let the word tell you what these steps are that you need to walk in if you're a sinner you can look to the word and the word is going to tell you you need to repent and in repenting if you sense the sense of forgiveness and the deliverance from sins it tells you what steps to walk in and that's where a believer starts and he never stops and those are footsteps that never fail i encourage you to fill your heart with the word of god do it in your home life do it in your personal life do it as a family fill your heart with the word of god let's stand fill your heart with the word of god let's pray this together as believers today there's already hands being raised you know where you are in your hearts but let's just say let's just pray together our gracious heavenly father lord you know uniquely my life the word which is a discerner discerns my heart my thoughts you see my weaknesses you see my shortcomings and my failures lord i'm coming boldly before the throne of grace today and i'm being honest i need you i'm not the man that i should be i'm not worried about how well i can fool everybody else lord not worried about my party face i'm not worried about my work pretense i'm not worried about whatever everybody else sees lord i'm fully conscious and aware of what your word sees lord i lean into your blood today i fall into your grace and say lord if there be any reflection in my life which is not in pleasing to you it's not because you have failed it is not because your word is not enough but lord it's my own stubbornness i have become deceived i failed i've wondered and i yield to you today lord to begin a work in me to continue a work lord do what you must do with your servant for i desire to worship you i desire to serve you lord as i express this from my heart there may be a particular tenor or sound that has come with these sermons there may be some pleading and some pull or longing from the word to get believers to commit and sinners to come home lord if you're calling out to one today to make the first steps of repentance lord may you deal with their heart and give them that unction to say lord i'm sorry to repent of sins lord may you take them in these baby steps of faith to walk into forgiveness of sins and water baptism lord all knowing that this birth as it's consummated with the baptisms of the holy ghost will put them in a fellowship with you where they're now subject to your mind and your word and all the instability and unrest goes away lord how our voices could cry out about the despondency and the depression and the thoughts of hopelessness and suicide that hounded us when we were double-minded but when we threw ourselves at your feet it sought you with our whole hearts lord our problems didn't go away all the issues weren't resolved but the instability and unrest was gone because the double mindedness had been broken lord i pray for those that fight with this flesh and this mind made the god of all comfort made the god who the master of all intelligence the god who formed and fashioned us as men and women as boys and girls the very creator of heavens and earth may he come to the aid of a child today or son or daughter of god and comfort them in a time of need give the wisdom that we so crave and desire nothing's too great for you we every single one of us right now lord in our minds and in our hearts we lay aside any thought that would say it's impossible with man this is impossible but with god with you all things are possible we strike out all fear lord we believe only that your word is true have your way may we fill our hearts with your word and with full hearts may we have mouthful we love you lord commit the people to you today in the name lord jesus christ we pray amen
