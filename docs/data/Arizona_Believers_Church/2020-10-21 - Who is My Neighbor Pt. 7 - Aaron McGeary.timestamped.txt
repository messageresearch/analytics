[0:02] ephesians chapter four
[0:04] read from verse 17 to verse 32.
[0:07] we'll read it here at the outset and
[0:10] perchance that we might not have time to
[0:11] get through
[0:13] um some of these particulars that paul
[0:15] is mentioning here
[0:17] but ephesians chapter 4 verses 17 to 32
[0:20] this i say therefore and testify in the
[0:23] lord
[0:24] that ye henceforth walk not as other
[0:26] gentiles walk
[0:27] in the vanity of their mind having the
[0:31] understanding darkened
[0:32] being alienated from the life of god
[0:35] through the ignorance that is in them
[0:36] because of the blindness of their heart
[0:40] who being past feeling have given
[0:42] themselves over into lasciviousness
[0:44] to work all uncleanness with greediness
[0:47] now he gives the contrast
[0:49] but ye have not so learned christ so
[0:52] it's their mindset their mentality that
[0:54] causes them to live and to act the way
[0:56] that they have it's what they've been
[0:57] taught
[0:58] it's what they've been nurtured in but
[0:59] now he shifts the picture but we have
[1:02] we haven't learned that way you have not
[1:04] so learned christ
[1:05] if so be that you have heard him and
[1:07] have been taught by him as the truth is
[1:09] in jesus that you put off concerning the
[1:12] former conversation
[1:13] the old man which is corrupt according
[1:15] to the deceitful lust
[1:17] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:18] mind and that you put on the new man
[1:20] which after god has created in
[1:22] righteousness and true holiness
[1:24] wherefore putting away line speak every
[1:26] man truth with his neighbor
[1:27] for we are members one of another be
[1:30] angry and sin not let not the sun go
[1:32] down upon your wrath that may
[1:34] comfort some that we can be angry but it
[1:37] says be angry and sin
[1:38] not we can be provoked to anger but we
[1:41] need to know how to
[1:42] process that process it bring it subject
[1:44] to the fruits of the spirit be angry and
[1:46] sin not let not the sun go down
[1:48] on your wrath neither give place to the
[1:50] devil
[1:51] let him that stole steel no more but
[1:53] rather let him labor working with his
[1:54] hands the thing which is good
[1:56] that he may have to give to him that
[1:58] needeth
[1:59] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[2:01] of your mouth but that which is good to
[2:03] the use of edifying
[2:04] that it may minister grace into the
[2:06] hearers and grieve not the holy spirit
[2:08] of god whereby you are sealed into the
[2:10] day of redemption
[2:11] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[2:13] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[2:14] from you
[2:15] with all malice and be a kind one to
[2:17] another
[2:18] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[2:21] as god for christ's sake
[2:22] hath forgiven you you may be seated
[2:28] we've are we've been ministering on the
[2:31] uh the subject of the of who is my
[2:35] neighbor
[2:36] and in looking at that we're examining
[2:40] the parable of the good samaritan it's
[2:41] how we most often would think about it
[2:43] in luke chapter 10 and the the question
[2:46] is asked
[2:47] by the lawyer who comes to jesus and
[2:50] what can i do to inherit eternal life
[2:52] and it prompts jesus to ask him well
[2:54] what is what do you read in the law and
[2:56] he reads that to love the lord thy god
[2:57] with all your
[2:58] heart soul and mind and to love your
[2:59] neighbor as yourself and
[3:01] jesus says that's good you've said well
[3:03] do that and you'll be well
[3:04] but then this convicted the lawyer and
[3:07] the lawyer says
[3:08] well then who is my neighbor and so it's
[3:10] in response to that question of who is
[3:12] my neighbor that jesus gives the parable
[3:14] of the good samaritan and we've been
[3:17] looking at
[3:18] these different actors and these
[3:20] different characters that are in this
[3:22] parable
[3:22] and so i'm just going to jump right into
[3:24] the middle of it knowing that we're all
[3:25] very familiar
[3:26] uh with this with this parable but we've
[3:29] been looking at it this way that jesus
[3:31] is
[3:31] challenging the lawyer to actually put
[3:33] himself in the shoes of the thieves
[3:36] of the priest of the levite and even
[3:39] the good samaritan maybe we could even
[3:41] say put yourself in the shoes of the one
[3:43] who's befallen
[3:44] on his way from jerusalem down to
[3:46] jericho but he's wanting to use these
[3:48] characters
[3:49] in a way to challenge this lawyer in his
[3:51] thinking how he
[3:52] narrowed his view of what a neighbor was
[3:54] how he narrowed his obligation to
[3:56] humanity
[3:57] and there's a lot of different ways that
[3:58] this parable is approached some look at
[4:00] it as an
[4:01] allegory of man being in sin others look
[4:04] at it very strictly as jesus correcting
[4:07] his attitude towards others and that it
[4:09] just speaks to being a
[4:10] good human being and being a
[4:12] humanitarian to everyone
[4:14] and not being driven by prejudice or
[4:16] bigotry
[4:17] but as we were looking at it last time
[4:19] we were looking how that whether we
[4:21] looked at the thieves
[4:22] uh the priest or the lord or the levite
[4:24] each were part of a social structure
[4:27] that behaved according to a certain
[4:28] expected norms there was a normative
[4:30] behavior
[4:31] a way that you acted and so we were
[4:33] looking at how they were part of a
[4:34] culture
[4:35] and being part of a culture there were
[4:37] certain things that were expected of
[4:38] them there were certain
[4:39] attitudes that they demonstrated because
[4:41] the group it kind of characterized the
[4:43] group
[4:43] and we were examining how all of them
[4:45] acted under the influence of a group
[4:47] dynamic
[4:48] they all they acted according to the
[4:50] culture whether they were in the group
[4:52] of thieves
[4:52] and so the group kind of caused them to
[4:54] do a certain thing or
[4:56] they were part of the group and even
[4:57] though absent from the group as a priest
[4:59] and a levite
[5:00] they still were susceptible to the
[5:02] culture of the group
[5:04] and we were pointing out that we're
[5:06] susceptible to those same kind of
[5:07] dynamics today
[5:09] that if we're not careful we behave
[5:11] under a group attitude or
[5:13] we act with the crowd and we looked at
[5:15] proverbs chapter 19 verse 21
[5:18] now it says there are many devices in a
[5:20] man's heart
[5:22] nevertheless the counsel of the lord
[5:24] that shall stand
[5:25] and we were looking at these devices
[5:27] that we all have on our hearts
[5:29] and i'm not talking about the device in
[5:31] your pocket or your purse or the device
[5:32] you left in the car
[5:33] or the device that you got grounded from
[5:35] earlier this week we're talking about
[5:36] the device that's actually in our
[5:38] thinking
[5:39] a device that's in our heart it means in
[5:41] invention or perception or thoughts
[5:43] it's actually calculations and instincts
[5:46] that we all have
[5:47] within our hearts so every man every
[5:50] woman
[5:50] every boy every girl has a device many
[5:52] devices in their hearts
[5:54] and he contrasts it with the counsel of
[5:56] the lord so the council lord
[5:58] that sure that's firm but there's many
[6:01] devices in a man's heart
[6:02] and you can't trust them you can't just
[6:05] give yourself
[6:06] over to your perceptions your thoughts
[6:08] and and the way the instincts and how
[6:09] you feel
[6:10] because we looked at how these devices
[6:12] in our hearts actually allow us
[6:14] to make judgments very quickly these
[6:16] calculations that we have
[6:18] in our hearts actually allow us to make
[6:20] decisions uh efficiently
[6:22] but there's a problem that comes with
[6:23] them because we can have what is called
[6:25] a cognitive bias
[6:26] and that's an error in your thinking you
[6:30] if you see this you run if you see that
[6:32] you hide if you see this that's good to
[6:33] eat whatever
[6:34] you have these certain processes and
[6:36] things you go through your mind but
[6:37] these things that help you make quick
[6:38] decisions sometimes can mislead us
[6:40] and so we were looking at these
[6:42] different errors in our thought process
[6:44] and how these these devices put us into
[6:46] groups
[6:48] because we want to belong we want to
[6:49] have a sense of belonging because we
[6:50] want to
[6:51] uh we don't want to be the oddball we
[6:52] want to we want to fit in with the crowd
[6:54] we're looking at all those different
[6:56] things
[6:56] and because because of these devices it
[6:59] allows the group to influence us
[7:01] these thoughts in our hearts these
[7:02] calculations these perceptions these
[7:04] devices
[7:05] allow uh motivate us and inspire us and
[7:08] move us and cause us to think and cause
[7:10] us to act
[7:12] and we are specifically looking at the
[7:13] power of the crowd
[7:15] the sway of the group and how we desire
[7:18] to conform and it's just in the nature
[7:20] of man
[7:20] we would rather mimic the group than
[7:22] appear to be odd or different we'd
[7:24] rather just kind of
[7:25] go along with what everyone else is
[7:26] doing instead of being the one who says
[7:28] it says otherwise and so it's easy to
[7:31] act
[7:32] then because of the group and we looked
[7:34] at that as the
[7:35] as jesus saying uh the thieves it was a
[7:38] group of thieves that preyed upon this
[7:40] man going down from jerusalem to jericho
[7:42] so that's this may be very very easy and
[7:44] very convenient for me
[7:46] uh wanting to minister on that subject
[7:48] of how the group thinks and how we act
[7:49] as a church and
[7:50] the kind of culture that we established
[7:52] in the beginning of something but it was
[7:54] a band of thieves it was a group of
[7:55] robbers that
[7:56] fell upon this man and robbed him and
[7:58] beat him beat him and took his clothing
[8:00] and took his goods
[8:01] but then it's also the same thing about
[8:03] the priest and the levites the scripture
[8:05] says that the priests have acted as a
[8:06] company of robbers and the very old
[8:08] testament was
[8:10] characterizing the priest as having that
[8:12] same kind of mindset
[8:14] so we looked at romans chapter 12 verse
[8:16] 2 and it says be not conformed to this
[8:18] world
[8:19] but be transformed by the renewing of
[8:21] your mind that ye
[8:23] may prove what is that good and
[8:25] acceptable and perfect
[8:27] will of god so paul says be not
[8:30] conformed to this world it implies
[8:32] a pressure that means there's a weight
[8:34] there's a heaviness there's a force
[8:36] in the world that would want you to
[8:38] conform to a particular
[8:39] image so as christians we are to never
[8:42] be conformed
[8:43] we don't even want to be conformed to
[8:45] the image of a christian we don't want
[8:46] to just be conformed to the image of a
[8:48] church member we don't want to be
[8:49] conformed to somebody who's simple and
[8:51] someone who's sweet
[8:52] but if we're going to be in the an image
[8:53] we want to be transformed so it says be
[8:55] not conformed to this
[8:57] world but be transformed by the renewing
[9:00] of your mind
[9:01] so paul is causing these two uh
[9:03] processes
[9:04] and i want to say compete but he wants
[9:07] to contrast them
[9:08] that be not conformed to this world in
[9:10] its judgment in its spirit in its
[9:12] attitude
[9:13] in its behavior but be transformed by
[9:15] the renewing of your mind
[9:17] so don't think like the world don't act
[9:18] like the world don't do what the world
[9:20] does by conforming to the world but
[9:22] rather be transformed by
[9:24] the renewing of your mind and we're
[9:27] and so what we're kind of just saying a
[9:29] few things here at the outset to review
[9:31] these many devices that we have on our
[9:33] hearts the world
[9:35] pressures us through those channels and
[9:38] because we have these
[9:39] instincts and because we have these
[9:40] shortcuts and because we have this
[9:42] learned behavior and this nature and
[9:44] even nurture in our minds
[9:45] the world can pressure us to sway our
[9:48] thinking and if it can sway our thoughts
[9:50] it sways our acting and that we were
[9:53] just looking at many different examples
[9:55] of that last time and i felt empty
[9:57] afterwards because
[9:58] we did labor a lot on just these
[10:00] different biases or these heuristics as
[10:02] we call them
[10:02] i i say we i'm kind of lumping myself in
[10:05] with the behavioral economics
[10:07] uh professors but um there's a word that
[10:10] there's a it's identifying these
[10:12] weaknesses and these biases and these
[10:14] behaviors
[10:15] we even looked at that robbers cave
[10:17] experiment where you just took
[10:18] 22 11 year old boys separated them into
[10:20] two different groups gave them names
[10:22] and without any prompting they
[10:24] immediately hated everybody else in the
[10:25] other group
[10:26] and it was simply the function of ide
[10:28] identity group identity
[10:30] and we're against them and we oppose
[10:32] them and we're just looking at kind of
[10:34] maybe
[10:34] the academics of it i felt a little bit
[10:36] empty because
[10:38] it was really just setting it up to show
[10:40] that we're all susceptible to that and
[10:42] how do we get out of it
[10:43] you really can't humanly we used an
[10:46] example a couple weeks ago that even
[10:48] when you
[10:48] tell somebody that you have this bias
[10:51] and it's very very difficult to overcome
[10:52] and a lot of people don't see it and
[10:54] they're not quick to recognize it
[10:55] and that's so with everybody and then
[10:57] you ask the person do you have it like
[10:59] oh no no i'm not like that at all
[11:02] because even being conscious of it you
[11:03] can't necessarily overcome it
[11:05] we looked at the conformity bias
[11:08] bandwagoning group think echo chambers
[11:10] the in-group bias these
[11:11] many different things that just relate
[11:14] to our natural lives and our natural way
[11:16] of thinking
[11:16] and where we use it to show that how we
[11:19] could all begin to act as a group
[11:21] and even acting as a group come off
[11:23] pretty good but that's not what god
[11:25] wants
[11:26] god wants individuals to have a personal
[11:29] experience with the word
[11:31] and then by that join us together in a
[11:33] family because we all have our own
[11:35] individual experiences
[11:36] and not create such a vibrant social a
[11:39] social community
[11:40] where we can just substitute a new birth
[11:41] experience you can't do that you can be
[11:43] very successful with group dynamics
[11:45] but that's not what church is all about
[11:47] it's not about just creating a vibrant
[11:49] group
[11:50] and so if we have all these tendencies a
[11:52] desire to conform or there's
[11:53] echo chamber and group think and in
[11:55] group biases
[11:56] how do we guard against these tendencies
[11:59] how is it that we can
[12:00] overcome these mechanisms it's right
[12:03] there in romans chapter 12 verse 2 be
[12:05] transformed
[12:05] amen be literally means be changed into
[12:08] another form
[12:10] and though one day we know our bodies
[12:11] are going to be changed right now our
[12:13] spirits
[12:15] are being changed and being molded into
[12:17] the right kind of character
[12:19] and so we want to be transformed changed
[12:21] into another form by having our mind the
[12:23] renewing of our minds that means the
[12:24] complete changing the renewing
[12:26] of our minds that's how we're going to
[12:28] overcome
[12:29] these devices in our hearts you're not
[12:31] going to be able to do it by human think
[12:33] if there's a problem with your thinking
[12:34] your thinking isn't going to fix
[12:36] your problematic thinking right just
[12:39] that's why we will say this often that
[12:41] the the scientific discipline that has
[12:43] uncovered these things within the human
[12:45] thought process and with respect to
[12:48] social behavior and
[12:49] all these weaknesses and the psychology
[12:51] the same discipline that diagnoses the
[12:53] sickness is not qualified to heal it
[12:56] only god is qualified to heal it and in
[12:59] the message god's power to transform
[13:02] brother brennan makes this statement and
[13:03] i'm wanting to emphasize
[13:05] what power is the scripture says be
[13:07] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[13:09] there has to be a factor that influences
[13:11] that
[13:11] and he says it's he sent his
[13:13] transforming power god
[13:15] sent his transforming power to bring you
[13:17] out of this deformity of religion that
[13:19] you're in
[13:20] in this deformity of chaos that we're in
[13:23] god has
[13:24] sent his transforming power his word
[13:27] vindicated proven to bring you out of
[13:29] this
[13:29] religious deformity of ignorance that
[13:31] you're walking in naked blind miserable
[13:33] and don't know it so the condition of
[13:35] laodicea is oh we're rich we're
[13:37] increased with goods we have need of
[13:38] nothing
[13:39] but yet is un does not know that they're
[13:41] poor miserable blind wretched naked
[13:44] that they're oblivious to it they are in
[13:45] fact poor they are in fact miserable and
[13:48] blind and naked
[13:49] but yet they're in their thinking
[13:50] they're rich they're increased with
[13:52] goods they have need of nothing
[13:53] well what's going to get somebody out of
[13:54] that condition the word of god
[13:57] that's why in revelations 3 it says come
[13:59] it speaks and says
[14:00] buy of me you take this ice savage and
[14:03] clothe yourself wash yourself repent
[14:06] because that's the only way that you
[14:07] could come out is if the word would draw
[14:09] you out
[14:10] in a minute being responsive to the word
[14:12] experience
[14:13] the transforming power of god so it's
[14:16] this transforming power that brings you
[14:18] out of chaos
[14:19] it's this transforming power that brings
[14:21] you out of mere religion
[14:22] because we realize that even if you go
[14:24] back to the beginning
[14:25] when adam and the woman fell and they
[14:28] clothed themselves and fig leaves it
[14:30] represented a religion just to cover
[14:31] themselves
[14:33] and religion is just a covering we don't
[14:36] just want religion we want a genuine
[14:38] experience with the word
[14:40] and a relationship with christ where i
[14:42] know i've been baptized into his body
[14:44] i know i'm communic communion with him
[14:46] and then the dynamics of a local
[14:47] fellowship and the preacher
[14:49] nurtures that experience i'm not just
[14:51] merely walking away from one idea to
[14:53] join another idea that's just religion
[14:55] and it takes god's transforming power to
[14:58] bring us out of
[14:58] the deformity of chaos of sin the
[15:00] deformity of religion
[15:02] into fellowship with him that's right
[15:04] the bible says in hebrews chapter 4
[15:06] verse 12
[15:07] for the word of god is quick and
[15:10] powerful
[15:11] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[15:14] piercing even the
[15:15] to the dividing asunder of soul and
[15:17] spirit and of the joints and
[15:19] moral and is a discerner of the thoughts
[15:22] and intents of the heart
[15:24] so the word of god is quick
[15:27] powerful sharper than any two-edged
[15:29] sword
[15:31] and that's what that's the transforming
[15:32] power transforming power of god is quick
[15:35] you think your
[15:36] thought processes are quick you think
[15:38] your
[15:39] your computation power is really really
[15:41] good i i don't know how many gigs of ram
[15:43] you think you might have or what your
[15:44] process is running at
[15:45] and uh i mean the human mind is really
[15:48] is incredible when you think about it
[15:50] because
[15:50] your mind is acting as a computer and
[15:52] computers exist because of human minds
[15:55] they just don't they're not just burped
[15:56] out of a volcano i mean
[15:58] it's people that program these things
[16:00] and think about these processes and put
[16:02] these things together
[16:03] because it's a it's a function of the
[16:04] human mind this human mind is amazing
[16:06] but the word of god is quicker
[16:09] the word of god is more powerful it is
[16:10] sharper than a two-edged sword
[16:12] and it says it can actually divide among
[16:14] soul spirit and the body
[16:17] that's what the word of god can do and
[16:19] in doing so i
[16:20] i you read this we could take other
[16:22] scriptures into this the word of god can
[16:24] minister to the body it ministers to the
[16:25] spirit it ministers to the soul
[16:27] it's quick it's powerful it can divide
[16:29] even among these parts of the human
[16:31] and this is the part i want to focus on
[16:32] it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[16:34] intents of the heart
[16:36] we have unconscious bias we have
[16:38] unconscious thought processes we have
[16:40] things that
[16:40] influences us and we don't even know why
[16:43] to the point to where there's some
[16:44] scientists that believe that you
[16:46] actually do are not
[16:47] a free moral agent that everything you
[16:50] prefer in life you can bring it back to
[16:52] some event or circumstance
[16:53] that influenced that way you that way
[16:56] and i thought so i really don't like
[16:57] doc or like dr pepper i really don't
[17:00] somebody else did
[17:02] or it was given to me and that's just
[17:04] the reason why i like it because i was
[17:05] five years old at a restaurant in san
[17:07] diego
[17:08] and and i had which it could have been
[17:09] san diego back then you couldn't get dr
[17:11] pepper in the west
[17:12] uh back then but just something happened
[17:14] in your life and now you like something
[17:15] and you think you chose it but it's just
[17:17] some other influence
[17:19] and so the word of god is actually a
[17:21] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[17:23] the heart
[17:24] the very things that were unconscious to
[17:26] the word of god can enlighten us to them
[17:29] the word of god is a discerner of her
[17:31] own thoughts we can
[17:33] we place this scripture sometimes in the
[17:34] dynamics of the word
[17:37] independently discerning someone else's
[17:39] thoughts and so you maybe uh two
[17:41] different ways like the preaching of the
[17:42] word discerns your thoughts and
[17:44] preaching the word discerns your
[17:45] circumstances or a gifted discernment
[17:47] that could uncover something in your
[17:49] life you say
[17:49] well that would have to be the word but
[17:51] the word works within yourself
[17:54] the the word of god within yourself by
[17:56] the spirit of god is a discerner of your
[17:58] thoughts and the intents of your heart
[18:00] so that you can judge your own behavior
[18:03] you can judge your thought process so
[18:05] when we say well we have these biases we
[18:08] have these weaknesses we have these
[18:09] tendencies in our flesh
[18:10] how can we overcome these mechanisms we
[18:12] need the word to examine our instincts
[18:15] we need the word to examine our
[18:17] judgments we need the word to inspect
[18:19] our devices
[18:21] is that knee-jerk reaction completion to
[18:23] the holy spirit
[18:24] is that ideas that bias is that judgment
[18:27] is that prejudice
[18:28] is that pleasing to the lord and that's
[18:30] your only protection
[18:32] we i listen and i don't mean this is any
[18:35] disrespect at all
[18:36] but we can't we cannot just kind of go
[18:38] with the flow of the awakening of social
[18:40] justice and being
[18:42] awoke church and we're all aware of all
[18:44] the injustices and we're all aware of
[18:46] how people are sensitive
[18:47] you don't want to offend anyone that
[18:48] kind of awareness eventually just leads
[18:50] to hypocrisy within itself
[18:52] because you've got to have an absolute
[18:54] you've got to have some
[18:56] basis to judge things by and this is our
[18:59] only hope this
[19:00] is our only protection is the word of
[19:02] god not culture not science not society
[19:08] and it's the only way you can guard
[19:09] against getting caught up in and some of
[19:11] the polarization that takes place
[19:14] and and so i i want to say this just
[19:16] kind of set up our next step
[19:18] the thieves the priest and the levite
[19:22] i was pondering this this week they all
[19:24] represent a specific temptation for the
[19:26] lawyer
[19:28] that then in some way the lawyer ought
[19:29] to be able to identify with the
[19:31] challenge that each one
[19:32] faced whether it be the thieves whether
[19:34] it be the priest or whether it be the
[19:35] levite
[19:36] he was being challenged with very
[19:38] specific roles or attitudes or behavior
[19:41] or temptations that he realized i
[19:43] wrestle with these things i fight these
[19:45] things he's being challenged in the end
[19:47] well which one do you think was neighbor
[19:48] to the one who fell among thieves and he
[19:50] answered correctly but you notice in
[19:52] answering this is really
[19:54] interesting to think about this he
[19:56] didn't say the samaritan
[20:00] he had to say oh well the one that the
[20:01] one that showed mercy
[20:03] almost as if the bias was still so
[20:05] strong in his heart
[20:07] he couldn't say the samaritan he had to
[20:10] say well
[20:11] it's the one that showed mercy boy is
[20:13] the word not a discerner
[20:16] does the word not know how just to get
[20:18] right into someone's face
[20:20] and challenge him to where this lawyer
[20:22] was so had he still
[20:24] wrestled with overcoming the bigotry
[20:26] overcoming the prejudice
[20:28] overcoming the idea that the samaritan's
[20:30] not my neighbor i don't have to be kind
[20:31] to him
[20:32] i don't have to be good to where he
[20:33] couldn't even say the samaritan
[20:35] he had to say the one that showed mercy
[20:38] so these in the scenario that we're
[20:39] reading in this parable
[20:41] each player is significant each fact is
[20:43] important as jesus frames it
[20:45] and i believe this lawyer was being uh
[20:47] shown
[20:48] at a very specific example of a
[20:50] temptation that he faced
[20:53] and our minds it's a mass of
[20:57] complex cognitive circuitry
[21:00] it just if we want to think about wires
[21:03] and circuits and nodes and all sorts of
[21:05] hardware and
[21:06] and software whatever it's just a mass
[21:08] of this complex circuitry in our heads
[21:10] that's been programmed over thousands of
[21:12] years and you say well brother aaron i'm
[21:14] only i'm only 50 years
[21:16] old no i'm talking about humanity has
[21:18] been programmed for over
[21:19] for thousands of years it's been under
[21:21] the weight and the influence of the
[21:23] world
[21:24] the mind the human mind is the product
[21:26] of the nature and nurture of fallen
[21:28] humanity
[21:30] and a world that's under the influence
[21:31] of satan
[21:33] and so there's ways that we behave now
[21:35] ways that we act now
[21:37] that the remnants of our ancestors
[21:40] of hundreds of years ago that this is
[21:44] the way that they
[21:45] lived this is the way that they acted
[21:46] they had to be quick to recognize
[21:48] certain kind of threats and they had to
[21:50] uh they had to respond to certain things
[21:52] and they had to endure
[21:53] certain things and you say well is this
[21:55] this is some kind of evolution well it
[21:57] is some kind of evolution
[21:58] we are the product of hundreds of years
[22:00] of development of our bodies and our
[22:02] psychology and
[22:04] and our thinking as humans and i wanted
[22:06] to emphasize this
[22:07] that's the product of a fallen nature in
[22:09] the nurture of a fallen world
[22:12] in ephesians chapter 2 verses 2 and 3
[22:16] paul paul expresses those things in
[22:18] these terms
[22:22] he's talking about those that have been
[22:23] quickened but now
[22:26] he says in ephesians chapter 2 verses 2
[22:27] and 3 wherein in time past
[22:29] you walked according to the course of
[22:31] this world
[22:32] so there was a chorus that you walked in
[22:35] before you were quickened
[22:37] and that course was determined by the
[22:40] world
[22:41] in in times past before you were born
[22:43] again before you were quickened
[22:45] by the baptism of the holy ghost you
[22:47] walked according to the course the way
[22:48] the flow
[22:49] the influence of the world according to
[22:51] the prince of the power of the air so
[22:54] there was an unseen power the prince of
[22:56] the power of the air this
[22:57] the hidden springs that were shown even
[22:59] in the book of daniel
[23:00] where we see demonic forces that rule
[23:02] governments that opposed michael
[23:04] and these and these things that take
[23:05] place in hidden realms the prince of the
[23:07] power of the
[23:08] air is moving the course of this world
[23:10] he says the spirit that now worketh and
[23:12] the children
[23:13] of disobedience among whom also we all
[23:16] had our conversation in times past
[23:18] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[23:21] desires of the flesh and of the mind
[23:23] and we're by nature the children of
[23:25] wrath even as others
[23:27] so by virtue of your first birth which
[23:29] all of us here tonight we can guarantee
[23:31] you had a first birth
[23:33] and so we we all be in here we have a
[23:36] way that we should look at this and
[23:37] identify with it
[23:38] by virtue of our human experience being
[23:40] born of a woman
[23:42] we have in our flesh and in our mind
[23:44] lust and desires
[23:45] instincts and wants and particular needs
[23:48] ways that we are influenced and paul
[23:50] is just telling us what we already know
[23:51] he's just using very uh
[23:53] a very thoughtful thought-provoking
[23:56] language to say that when we were born
[23:57] we all had our lives and times past
[23:59] fulfilling the lust of our flesh
[24:01] fulfilling the desires of our flesh
[24:03] following the the course of our mind
[24:05] what we wanted and by virtue of our
[24:07] first birth we were by nature
[24:10] we had in ourselves the same kind of
[24:12] lust the same kind of desires
[24:13] as someone who would forever be lost the
[24:16] children of rap people who are ordained
[24:18] ordained to wrath don't think that when
[24:20] you were born the first time
[24:21] that there was something in your first
[24:24] nature that made you
[24:25] different than those who who cannot
[24:27] receive christ or those who cannot serve
[24:29] christ
[24:29] it has nothing to do with your first
[24:30] birth
[24:33] so we are by nature by our first birth
[24:36] subject to lust in the flesh
[24:38] and because we have this in our nature
[24:40] then the nurture of the world can just
[24:43] move us where it wants us to go that's
[24:45] why marketing is successful
[24:47] that's why i feel fairly confident that
[24:49] some of you this week already even
[24:51] though it's wednesday
[24:52] succumbed to some sort of advertising
[24:54] and bought the product or signed up for
[24:55] the service
[24:57] you're like wow is it really that good
[24:59] is it really that amazing
[25:00] sign me up it's because they know how to
[25:03] market things they know how to share
[25:04] things they know how to spend things
[25:05] they know how to
[25:06] get you craving something because it's
[25:08] just the way that the world
[25:10] works and so it says the course of this
[25:12] world the prince of the power of the
[25:14] air the spirit that works within the
[25:16] people for
[25:17] praying on the lust of your flesh the
[25:18] desires of the flesh and of the mind
[25:20] because of your nature
[25:22] now it says this in first john chapter 2
[25:25] verses 16 and 17. first john chapter 2
[25:28] verses 16 and 17.
[25:30] now notice how succinctly he play defy
[25:33] just
[25:33] uh summarizes this for all that is in
[25:36] the world he's telling us love not the
[25:37] world nor the things of the world
[25:38] because if you love the world the love
[25:40] of the father is not in you for all that
[25:41] is
[25:42] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[25:44] lust of the eyes
[25:45] and the pride of life is not of the
[25:47] father but is of the world
[25:50] so we can summarize everything that is
[25:52] in the world that paul is even talking
[25:54] about the course of this world
[25:55] the course of this world the force of
[25:57] this world the pressure of this world
[25:59] the conformity of this world is lust of
[26:02] the flesh left of the eyes pride of life
[26:05] if you're going to be tempted it's going
[26:06] to fall into one of these categories
[26:08] if you're going to be swayed or moved to
[26:10] sin or to doubt god or have a weakness
[26:12] in your flesh
[26:12] it's going to be some element working
[26:14] upon the lust of the flesh to the lust
[26:16] of the eyes and the pride of life
[26:18] it is the these three lust and this
[26:20] pride
[26:21] that the woman was tempted with in the
[26:23] garden of eden
[26:24] it is these very same uh lust the lust
[26:27] of the eye the lust of the flesh and the
[26:28] prayer life the very same things that
[26:29] temp
[26:30] tempted christ in the wilderness it's
[26:32] the very same things that tempt all of
[26:34] us on a daily basis
[26:35] because we are by nature subject to the
[26:37] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[26:39] and the pride of life
[26:40] doesn't even have to be evil oh i'm
[26:42] craving to do drugs and oh i'm lusting
[26:44] after this
[26:44] it doesn't even have to be that it's
[26:46] just the normal appetites that we have
[26:48] that the world and that uses to cause us
[26:51] to conform
[26:52] to motivate us to push us to protest to
[26:54] make us do things that we
[26:56] otherwise wouldn't normally do and do
[26:58] things that are displeasing to god
[27:00] and it says all that in the world is the
[27:02] lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and
[27:04] the pride of life
[27:05] and those things are not of the father
[27:06] but of the world so he says in verse 17
[27:09] and the world
[27:09] passeth away and the lust thereof but he
[27:12] that doeth the will of god abideth
[27:14] forever
[27:15] there's your answer if all that is in
[27:18] the world is the lust of the eyes the
[27:19] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[27:20] you say well then what do i do
[27:22] if all that is in the world are these
[27:23] three things how in the world am i going
[27:25] to live beyond those get behind them
[27:26] live above them not be subject to them
[27:28] how am i going to do it we'll do the
[27:30] will of god
[27:32] but that's like the let's they escape
[27:34] all that is in the world the lust of the
[27:35] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of
[27:37] life how am i gonna do it how many do it
[27:38] the bible says he will with the
[27:39] temptation
[27:40] paul said no man is tempted above that
[27:42] which he is able but god
[27:44] will with the temptation hath with the
[27:46] temptation made a way of escape that
[27:48] you're able to bear it
[27:49] so there's there's no pride of life
[27:50] there's no lust of the flesh or lust of
[27:52] the eyes that god has not
[27:53] somewhere tangential to it somewhere in
[27:56] the temptation somewhere in the lust
[27:58] somewhere in the pride god has not set a
[28:00] door before you that you can walk
[28:02] through
[28:02] in obedience to him and escape these
[28:05] tendencies
[28:07] all that is in the world the lust of the
[28:08] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[28:10] of life
[28:11] stand opposed to the will of god
[28:14] you cannot fulfill the will of god and
[28:16] the lust of the flesh at the same time
[28:20] you cannot fulfill the will of god and
[28:21] be operated according to the pride of
[28:23] life
[28:23] at the same time
[28:27] now in the church age book when brother
[28:29] branham writes the church age book in
[28:30] chapter 9
[28:33] he's looking at how to him that
[28:34] overcometh will i grant
[28:37] and these different scriptures he says
[28:38] now what are we to overcome
[28:43] and he says that is the normal question
[28:45] to ask here
[28:48] but that is not the actual thought of
[28:50] this verse for it is not so much what we
[28:53] are to overcome
[28:54] but how we are to overcome
[28:57] now if i could uh is maybe even say this
[28:59] as a
[29:00] as a way of subjecting myself uh opening
[29:03] the door for criticism
[29:05] last wednesday was probably a lot of
[29:06] what we were to overcome
[29:09] the the cognitive biases and weaknesses
[29:11] and tendencies that all
[29:12] exist within the human mind and all
[29:14] related to the power of the group the
[29:16] power of the crowd
[29:16] and that would be what we're to overcome
[29:18] but now it's being distilled down to
[29:20] this
[29:21] it's not so much what but how he says
[29:23] now this is logical for does it matter
[29:26] it for does it matter much what we're to
[29:29] overcome as long as we know
[29:30] how we can overcome if we know how to
[29:33] overcome in every situation
[29:35] it's not necessarily that you know what
[29:37] i just need to know how
[29:39] if i know how to in every situation i
[29:41] don't need to know what i'm going to
[29:42] face
[29:43] i just need to know how i'm going to
[29:44] overcome it when i face it
[29:46] a quick look at the scriptures which
[29:48] involve the lord jesus overcoming
[29:50] will bring out the truth of this
[29:51] proposition in matthew 4 wherein jesus
[29:54] is tempted of the devil
[29:56] he overcame the personal temptations of
[29:58] satan
[29:59] by the word and the word only that's
[30:02] what he used
[30:03] even when the word was quoted back to
[30:05] him he used the word
[30:07] back and you realize that there's a way
[30:10] that he approached him to pray on the
[30:12] lust of the eyes
[30:12] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[30:14] life oh does that the scripture say this
[30:17] about you
[30:17] to maybe force him into into doing
[30:20] something to where the angels would bear
[30:22] him up
[30:23] prove to me that you're the son of god
[30:25] and and and the lust of the eyes the
[30:26] lust of the flesh and the pride life
[30:28] all in a way look at these kingdoms i
[30:30] can give them all to trying to prey on
[30:32] these things
[30:32] and what did he use to combat it not
[30:34] logic he didn't rationalize
[30:37] he used the word the word and the word
[30:39] only and each
[30:40] of the three major trials that
[30:42] corresponded exactly
[30:45] and each of the three major trials that
[30:47] corresponded exactly to the temptation
[30:49] of the garden of eden
[30:50] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[30:51] eye and the pride of life jesus overcame
[30:53] by the word
[30:55] he fell to the personal temptation of
[30:57] satan by failing to use the word
[30:59] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[31:01] word but jesus
[31:03] overcame by the word
[31:06] that's how he overcame and we'll we
[31:09] won't have the time to get into it
[31:11] tonight but maybe i'll just
[31:12] lay a little bit of a seed in there when
[31:14] brother branham preaches how can i
[31:15] overcome you overcome by the word and
[31:17] humility
[31:20] and so he said he overcame by the word
[31:22] he says and right now
[31:23] this is instructive to us i'm not the
[31:25] woman in the garden i'm not jesus in the
[31:27] wilderness but right now
[31:28] and right now let me say that this is
[31:30] the only way to be an overcomer
[31:33] also it is the only way that you can
[31:35] know if you are overcoming
[31:37] because that word can't fail
[31:41] what a what a better metric to come up
[31:43] with to measure ourselves by
[31:45] the world has all its all its balance
[31:47] sheets and all its
[31:48] signatures and everything that it looks
[31:50] for to determine whether or not you're
[31:52] successful
[31:52] and you can identify success merely by
[31:55] the fact that you're overcoming
[31:57] that's what makes a successful christian
[31:59] not your balance sheet not what kind of
[32:01] model car you're driving
[32:03] not how fancy things look or how blessed
[32:05] you may be in the natural
[32:06] but am i overcoming am i am i growing in
[32:09] the lord is there a trajectory where the
[32:11] spirit of god has lifted me higher
[32:13] in into greater realms of fellowship and
[32:16] deeper in the word of god
[32:17] we can we are successful when we're
[32:19] overcoming and he says the only way you
[32:21] can know if you're overcoming is by the
[32:23] word
[32:25] not if your neighbor tells you wow i've
[32:26] just noticed you really know how to cut
[32:28] your grass and
[32:29] i really noticed that everything's just
[32:30] perfect you must be a perfectionist
[32:31] nothing is out of order my goodness your
[32:33] garage is absolutely amazing i'm
[32:35] astounded by how neat and clean
[32:36] everything is
[32:37] i'm amazed at how much money you make
[32:39] and i've never even seen a car that nice
[32:40] before
[32:41] those are just all things that speak of
[32:43] someone being disciplined and taking
[32:44] good pride in their things which we all
[32:46] should
[32:47] but success real success real christian
[32:49] character is measured by overcoming
[32:53] the only way that you can be an
[32:55] overcomer is by the word and it's the
[32:56] only way you can know if you're
[32:57] overcoming
[32:58] is by the word my that's uh that's
[33:01] instructive
[33:03] so let's apply this example to the
[33:06] parable of the good samaritan
[33:08] that you can over only overcome by the
[33:10] word and you can only know if you're
[33:12] overcoming
[33:12] by the word so you use the word to
[33:14] overcome and it's the word that lets you
[33:15] know whether or not you are overcoming
[33:17] and i want to i want to think of it in
[33:19] an obvious way
[33:20] um and you might you might cringe a
[33:23] little bit because it's going to seem
[33:24] super obvious
[33:25] but if you think about the thieves they
[33:28] they rob a man and they nearly kill him
[33:31] so and i guess i shouldn't
[33:34] i shouldn't uh suggest that you'll
[33:36] cringe because i'm not making this up
[33:39] in exodus chapter 20 verses 13 and 15
[33:43] it says thou shalt not kill thou shalt
[33:46] not steal
[33:48] now wouldn't you think those two might
[33:50] just be assumed
[33:51] i mean we're a group of people
[33:54] we know how to act we know how to behave
[33:56] we know how to treat one another but
[33:58] no they needed to be told that you shall
[34:01] thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal
[34:04] and ponder that for a moment that even
[34:06] though you think this is decent people
[34:08] and
[34:08] we we function within a society where
[34:10] everyone should be able to respect one
[34:12] another
[34:12] and we should be able to be governed
[34:14] without certain moralities and certain
[34:16] rules or certain
[34:17] legislation but here man had to be told
[34:20] that this is a commandment you're not to
[34:22] skill and you're not to steal
[34:26] and this is this is something that might
[34:27] seem to be obvious these are things that
[34:29] might seem to be obvious
[34:30] but the word directly addresses these
[34:33] things within our hearts
[34:34] in order to i want to say binders but in
[34:37] order to con
[34:38] to constrain bad behavior
[34:43] there had to be a commandment that came
[34:45] from god it says thou shalt not kill
[34:47] so that there would be an authority that
[34:49] a person could yield themselves to
[34:51] in a moment of anger and a moment of
[34:52] jealousy and a moment of rationalizing
[34:54] while they did this i ought to do this
[34:56] back they had to constrain themselves
[34:58] and they could be governed by a
[34:59] commandment by a law that says
[35:01] don't do it and these thieves had a law
[35:04] that they should have subjected
[35:05] themselves to this is thou shalt not
[35:07] kill thou shalt not steal
[35:09] so if you're in a band of thieves and
[35:10] you're all thieves and you're wanting to
[35:12] go rob
[35:12] somebody someone should say well you
[35:14] know what the bible says we're not to
[35:16] steal
[35:17] and we're like huh what are you doing
[35:18] you're ruining our fun you know you wait
[35:20] time
[35:20] but it says we shouldn't steal that
[35:22] should have been what controlled their
[35:24] behavior
[35:25] even though we could think well man
[35:26] wouldn't a decent person just think not
[35:28] to do it
[35:29] well perhaps but it shows the word
[35:32] addresses the issue identifies the
[35:36] weakness but there's a word there
[35:38] to to constrain us to keep us in line in
[35:41] harmony
[35:42] with the right thing exodus chapter 23
[35:46] this is maybe even more to the point of
[35:49] what we were speaking on last time
[35:53] exodus chapter 23 verse 2 thou shalt not
[35:56] follow a multitude to do evil
[36:00] there it is right there in your bible
[36:02] there's a tendency for man
[36:03] to get caught up in the mob and do
[36:06] something they shouldn't do
[36:08] so there's a word there that says don't
[36:10] follow the crowd to do something
[36:12] wrong why you won't be justified just
[36:14] because everyone else is doing it
[36:16] you cannot just say well thousands of
[36:18] others were doing it
[36:20] everybody else cheats on their taxes
[36:22] everybody else does this everybody else
[36:24] does it there's no excuse
[36:26] the bible says do not follow a multitude
[36:28] of a crowd a throng of people
[36:30] to do evil it's written in the word why
[36:32] because human nature
[36:34] is just to kind of follow the crowd it
[36:36] says don't do it
[36:38] this is a word that we have that can
[36:39] become a part of our
[36:41] our database as it were that uh
[36:44] motivates us that enlightens us that
[36:46] instinct that's there whenever
[36:47] some the crowd is rising up something's
[36:49] happened a group's going one way
[36:51] there's something that rises up in your
[36:52] heart as a discernment says wait a
[36:54] minute the word of the
[36:55] lord says don't follow a multitude to do
[36:57] evil and your discernment kicks in and
[36:59] you stop and say hey whoa whoa whoa
[37:01] whoa whoa wait a minute i don't want to
[37:03] partake in that
[37:06] then it says neither shalt thou speak in
[37:08] a cause to decline
[37:10] after many to rest judgment now
[37:14] that's a uh i could keep reading that to
[37:16] you and it won't get any clearer
[37:18] neither shalt thou speak in a cause to
[37:20] decline after many to rest
[37:22] judgment in other words don't change
[37:24] your conviction or your testimony
[37:26] just because the crowd is i've read it
[37:28] in a number of different places and
[37:30] translations to try to understand what
[37:31] it means don't change your conviction
[37:33] don't give a testimony in order to side
[37:36] with the majority
[37:38] because it says after many when many are
[37:40] perverting justice
[37:42] don't speak in a way to join your voice
[37:45] with theirs
[37:47] when they're speaking perversely just
[37:50] because everyone else is declaring
[37:52] something just because everyone else is
[37:53] espousing something
[37:54] just because everyone else is saying
[37:55] something don't add your voice to theirs
[37:58] if it's injustice don't add your voice
[38:01] to theirs if it's unrighteousness
[38:04] again it's showing that there's a
[38:05] tendency for some that if they
[38:07] see the crowd doing something they want
[38:09] to join with the crowd
[38:11] they want to say what everyone else is
[38:13] saying they don't want to be the one
[38:15] that's not saying something in the
[38:16] society we live in now
[38:18] it's a it's a bully of a society if you
[38:19] don't say something they want to bully
[38:21] you and bully and bully you till you do
[38:22] say something
[38:23] and the bible says don't if it's an
[38:25] injustice if it's not right if it's a
[38:27] perversion of righteousness
[38:28] do not add your voice to it why does the
[38:30] bible even speak
[38:32] like that because it's human nature to
[38:34] do it
[38:35] and what i'm wanting you to understand
[38:37] is that if there's any weakness of the
[38:39] flesh if there's any tendency whether it
[38:40] be group dynamics or just human behavior
[38:42] or
[38:43] own individual behavior there is a word
[38:46] there is a counsel of the lord there is
[38:49] a power a transforming power in the word
[38:51] of god
[38:51] to change our thinking from natural
[38:53] thinking worldly thinking to thinking
[38:56] like christ
[39:00] and the priest and the levite
[39:05] jesus is clearly suggesting by this
[39:07] parable
[39:08] that the commandment to love thy
[39:10] neighbor as yourself obligated the
[39:12] priest and the levite to render aid to
[39:13] the man who fell among thieves
[39:15] he's directly i i maybe i use i use the
[39:19] word suggesting but he's directly
[39:21] connecting
[39:22] love thy neighbor as thyself as
[39:24] enjoining and
[39:25] obligating the priest and the levite to
[39:27] reach out and render aid
[39:29] that's the very thrust of what jesus is
[39:31] saying he said well there's a man who
[39:33] went down
[39:33] from jerusalem to jericho and he fell
[39:35] among thieves well the thieves are
[39:37] thieves they're going to act like
[39:38] thieves so now you have a man that's
[39:39] beaten and robbed he's half dead
[39:40] laying on the side of the road and a
[39:42] priest walked by jesus
[39:44] is saying very directly the priest ought
[39:46] to have stopped
[39:47] because the bible says love thy neighbor
[39:50] as thyself
[39:51] jesus is clearly saying that the levite
[39:54] ought to have stopped
[39:55] because the bible says love thy neighbor
[39:58] as thyself
[39:59] in other words leviticus 19 verse 18
[40:01] thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[40:03] grudge against the children of thy
[40:04] people
[40:05] but thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[40:07] thyself
[40:08] i am the lord and there's other places
[40:11] we've read already
[40:13] that address this love thy neighbor as
[40:15] thyself that would have been a
[40:16] commandment to the jew a commandment to
[40:18] the priest a commandment to the levite
[40:20] those of the
[40:21] the house of aaron that they would have
[40:23] looked upon someone even if they weren't
[40:25] a jew they would have been obligated
[40:27] to help them and so jesus is using them
[40:30] as an example to show
[40:32] that you had a responsibility in the
[40:34] word
[40:36] what should have caused the priest not
[40:37] to pass by on to the side but to go
[40:39] and to help this one the word should
[40:41] have caused him to do it
[40:43] the levite and then by using the levite
[40:45] it puts it into a different category
[40:47] whereas you could say well the priest he
[40:48] had to actually touch the sacrifices
[40:50] he was more functional in ceremony he
[40:52] would have had to give greater caution
[40:54] to approaching someone who was dead but
[40:55] the levite um
[40:57] he he would be more inclined to have
[40:59] greater liberty but listen
[41:00] jesus is actually exposing an air in the
[41:03] human heart to where they
[41:05] he he's identified this way this
[41:07] commandment to love thy neighbor as
[41:08] thyself
[41:09] ought to been given priority over all
[41:11] these other ordinances
[41:14] and this is where i i could even think
[41:16] of how they were legalists
[41:18] well i'm a priest i'm not supposed to
[41:19] touch any dead thing
[41:21] right and uses that as an excuse to not
[41:23] obey another part of the word
[41:25] or rationalize with it well you know he
[41:28] looks dead and
[41:29] i'm i can't touch something that's dead
[41:31] and
[41:32] and just the rationalizing that would
[41:34] have gone just think i was thinking of
[41:35] it this way last week
[41:36] just the mental gymnastics the mental
[41:38] wrestling all the devices
[41:40] in the heart of the levite and the
[41:41] priest that they're going through as
[41:43] they're walking down this road and they
[41:44] see a man beat up and maybe like oh
[41:47] i should probably help him no i probably
[41:49] shouldn't
[41:50] you know well he looks dead anyways and
[41:52] i kind of doesn't look like a jew and
[41:54] just
[41:54] everything he had to go through instead
[41:57] of just having a nature that's subject
[41:59] to the word of god
[42:00] and then acts according to the word of
[42:02] god even have a discerning spirit that
[42:05] says you know what
[42:06] this this your desire to move past this
[42:09] to not reach out to not do the right
[42:10] thing
[42:11] you're rationalizing a way to uh to
[42:13] remove yourself from the spiritual
[42:15] obligation
[42:16] you rationalize it with conviction in
[42:18] order to get yourself from off the hot
[42:20] seat
[42:20] because something is convicting you to
[42:22] do the right thing so you start thinking
[42:24] about all these scriptures and all these
[42:25] statements and all these quotes as a way
[42:26] to rationalize
[42:27] why you shouldn't do it we've all done
[42:30] that
[42:31] the lord's put in your heart to do
[42:32] something
[42:37] it might even be just to humble yourself
[42:38] to somebody who did you wrong
[42:40] but maybe you didn't respond just right
[42:43] but they did wrong first
[42:45] and the lord's really working on you
[42:46] just to humble yourself and say you're
[42:48] sorry
[42:49] you're like but you know what i didn't
[42:50] start that i'm not the one that started
[42:52] and you know what what i did wasn't even
[42:54] half as bad as what they did
[42:55] and if i say i'm sorry then they're not
[42:57] going to realize that they were wrong
[42:59] and you know what this is righteous
[43:01] indignation and they need to know that
[43:03] they're wrong because if they don't know
[43:04] that they're wrong they're going to stay
[43:05] wrong and if they stay wrong they can't
[43:06] get right and then they can't get saved
[43:08] so if i apologize i'm going to send them
[43:11] no you've just went to this whole
[43:14] paradigm
[43:14] like this trying to figure out a way to
[43:16] not just do what the holy spirit was
[43:18] convicting you to do let's just say hey
[43:19] you know what i'm sorry i shouldn't have
[43:20] done that
[43:26] so the scripture says in numbers chapter
[43:28] 19 verse 11
[43:30] it says this about the priest he that
[43:33] toucheth the dead body of any man shall
[43:35] be unclean
[43:36] seven days so the priest
[43:39] now i know immediately we start thinking
[43:40] well see uh-huh he had a good reason
[43:42] because we won't identify with the
[43:44] priest right righteous pious offering
[43:45] worship
[43:46] one of the special people that get to go
[43:48] in and offer the sacrifice
[43:50] but i want you to notice something here
[43:52] there's no prohibition
[43:55] on touching a dead body it's just there
[43:58] was a consequence
[44:00] and not even a real bad one but they
[44:02] just had to quarantine for seven days
[44:04] right that's what they had to do hey if
[44:07] you've touched some of a dead body
[44:09] then you're unclean for seven days and
[44:10] they had to go through a process of
[44:12] cleansing it didn't invalidate temple
[44:14] worship
[44:15] didn't keep them from ultimately
[44:16] offering sacrifices it was just you know
[44:18] what if you touch a dead body
[44:20] then you're out of service for seven
[44:22] days you have to step back and
[44:23] ceremonially wash yourself and cleanse
[44:25] yourself and praise yourself as a priest
[44:26] so it's not that to touch a dead body
[44:29] is an abomination to the lord or that it
[44:30] was prohibited to priests it was just
[44:32] that if you had to touch someone who was
[44:34] who was dead then you there was a
[44:36] process that you went through for seven
[44:37] days
[44:38] to to remedy that and it speaks to a lot
[44:41] of other things a lot of other types
[44:43] but i'm pointing this out because the
[44:45] priest
[44:47] could have used that as an excuse as to
[44:49] why he didn't help
[44:52] well if i if i helped him then i i then
[44:55] i wouldn't be
[44:56] able to offer sacrifice i'd have been
[44:57] unclean for seven days and he realized
[44:59] just the thought process the
[45:00] rationalizing what would it been an
[45:03] inconvenience to you would it would have
[45:06] been too much to say i'll i'll gladly
[45:09] go through the process of sanctifying
[45:12] myself for seven days
[45:14] if that's what it takes to make sure
[45:16] that this man
[45:17] is not half dead and could be revived
[45:22] because all it would have meant is for
[45:23] seven days you're going to have to purge
[45:24] yourself
[45:25] you're going to be in clean for seven
[45:26] days he wouldn't be forfeiting the
[45:27] ministry he wouldn't be forfeiting his
[45:28] position as a priest but it was to him
[45:30] an inconvenience
[45:33] it's to him he used numbers 19 he that
[45:36] touches a dead body
[45:37] he used it as actually an excuse to keep
[45:39] himself for fulfilling leviticus 19
[45:42] love thy neighbor as thyself and when
[45:44] you start doing that you've perverted
[45:46] the word
[45:48] because you can't take one prescription
[45:50] or obligation
[45:51] or something in the word of god that
[45:52] you're required to do and make it
[45:54] compete with another requirement in the
[45:56] word
[45:56] and then wade them and say well i'll do
[45:58] this but not that because if i do this
[46:01] then i won't be able to do that
[46:05] notice what it says in exodus chapter 23
[46:07] verses 4 and 5.
[46:09] i'm sharing this just to to show the
[46:12] weakness of the rationalizing that the
[46:14] priests would have been going through
[46:15] because it says if thou meet thine
[46:17] enemy's ox or his ass going astray
[46:20] thou shalt surely bring it back to him
[46:22] again if your
[46:23] enemy's donkey gets loose you're to
[46:25] bring his donkey back
[46:28] if thou see the ass of him that hateth
[46:30] thee lying
[46:31] under his burden and would has forbeared
[46:34] to help him thou
[46:35] shalt surely help with him
[46:38] are you picking up what this scripture
[46:40] is laying down if the one who
[46:42] hates you if his donkey is laden with
[46:44] his burden has fallen
[46:46] you are obligated to help the man who
[46:49] hates you to help his donkey up
[46:52] the one who is your enemy if his donkey
[46:54] gets loose
[46:55] you were to bring it back to him in
[46:57] other words there is no reason to
[46:59] justify bad behavior
[47:00] because someone is your enemy or because
[47:02] they hate you well there goes his donkey
[47:06] gonna lose that one hey why am your
[47:10] donkey no it says take them
[47:13] and bring them back is it you wouldn't
[47:16] want it you don't take the donkey and
[47:17] push it in a ditch or hide it or
[47:19] steal it or whatever you do donkey jack
[47:21] or whatever you do back then
[47:23] you you'd help them out to the man that
[47:26] hates you
[47:28] to the one that is your enemy and if you
[47:30] were to do that to your enemies donkey
[47:33] how much more were you to do that to a
[47:34] man who's laying in the road
[47:37] naked beaten in half dead the bible
[47:39] would actually
[47:40] ask you to care for the livestock of
[47:42] your enemy care for the livestock of a
[47:44] man who hates you how much more would it
[47:46] ask you to render aid to that man
[47:48] if he was laying on the side of the road
[47:49] beaten and broken and half dead
[47:52] you couldn't say oh well you know i
[47:53] offer worship and i offer sacrifices and
[47:55] if i touch that i won't be able to do it
[47:56] for seven days
[47:58] but you've got it all wrong you've built
[48:00] this legalism and self-justification
[48:02] it's the rationale that the the lawyer
[48:04] used when he said well who is my
[48:06] neighbor
[48:07] notice how jesus addresses this head-on
[48:09] in matthew chapter 23 verse 23
[48:14] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[48:17] hypocrites
[48:19] for you pay tithe of mint and anise and
[48:21] cumin
[48:23] so you're going to tie on on the
[48:24] fractions of spice
[48:27] you're going to tie it to where well
[48:29] here's the mint and i need
[48:31] the 10 they're gonna get so particular
[48:34] and so
[48:36] legalistic on the tithing of these
[48:39] things and have omitted the weightier
[48:41] matters
[48:42] of the law judgment mercy and faith
[48:46] he's calling him out you're really super
[48:48] strict in some areas
[48:49] how did he say we may have read it
[48:51] already before you can swallow a camel
[48:54] but you choke on a net yeah
[48:57] there's things that you're so you get so
[48:59] bogged down on
[49:00] strain on you strain on a gnat and you
[49:02] swallow camel you're so
[49:04] specific about tithing on the men and
[49:05] the anus and the cumin
[49:07] but you leave out the bigger things the
[49:09] more weightier things of judgment mercy
[49:11] and faith
[49:12] you're all worried about whether you're
[49:14] going to be able to offer a sacrifice
[49:16] i'm speaking to the priest now i think
[49:17] the levite comes under this umbrella as
[49:19] well
[49:19] but you're so worried about numbers 19
[49:21] that you forsake leviticus
[49:22] leviticus 19. exodus 23
[49:25] you're so worried about one spot and one
[49:28] thing and you're so particular
[49:29] oh make sure you don't touch the
[49:30] sepulcher make sure you don't touch this
[49:32] make sure you don't
[49:32] wash the pots and do all those and
[49:34] you're so careful about all this other
[49:35] stuff but then the things that really
[49:36] matter the weightier matters this is you
[49:40] you
[49:40] forsake judgment and mercy you laid in
[49:43] obligations on people and you
[49:45] watch them wrestle and fight and try to
[49:47] figure out their way out from underneath
[49:48] all your bondage
[49:49] and your legalism and you don't even
[49:50] lift one finger to help them out
[49:53] and he says this these all you have to
[49:55] have done
[49:56] and to not leave the other undone
[50:00] isn't that beautiful surely that they
[50:02] would have just been all up and arms
[50:04] what do you mean you're not going to
[50:04] make
[50:05] they got a tithe on their mint they
[50:08] need to be precise with their tithe
[50:10] jesus does not walk away from that
[50:12] he says you ought to have done the
[50:13] tithing
[50:15] and the mercy judgment and faith
[50:19] yes you you should do the other part but
[50:21] you also should do the other
[50:22] don't do the one and leave the other
[50:23] undone what good has it done you in the
[50:25] end
[50:27] it says in second corinthians chapter 3
[50:28] verse 6
[50:33] he says who also hath made us christ
[50:37] god hath made us able ministers of the
[50:38] new testament let's make ourselves all
[50:40] included in that we're able ministers of
[50:42] the new testament
[50:44] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[50:47] the letter
[50:47] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[50:52] all right maybe just to shock some of
[50:54] you who haven't figured it out yet or
[50:55] don't know yet i'm a lawyer it's what i
[50:57] do during the day it's what pays the
[50:58] bills
[50:59] i practice law to make a living but i
[51:02] preach to make a leaving
[51:06] and we're all getting we're all going to
[51:07] leave together
[51:09] so the uh the the practical law pays the
[51:13] bills
[51:13] the word is going to make me escape them
[51:16] all one day
[51:18] and and so in the in the practical law
[51:20] this particular area that i practice is
[51:21] in securities
[51:23] it's actually written in one of the
[51:25] major areas that i that i focus on
[51:28] and the and the preamble to it an
[51:30] introduction to the rule
[51:31] it basically says look technical
[51:34] compliance with the following
[51:36] doesn't matter if whatever you're doing
[51:39] is a scheme
[51:40] to avoid registration or to avoid
[51:43] breaking the rule
[51:45] in other words the spirit of the rule
[51:47] has to be honored not just the letter of
[51:49] it
[51:50] if you do everything in order to meet
[51:52] the requirements as a scheme to avoid
[51:54] the consequences
[51:55] of not meeting the requirements you
[51:57] haven't really met the requirements
[51:58] because the spirit of the law matters
[52:01] and that's exactly what jesus is saying
[52:03] he's saying paul is saying look
[52:05] we've been made ministers of the new
[52:06] testament but not just the letter of it
[52:08] did you do this did you just do this
[52:09] and just the legalistic the black and
[52:11] white of it but the spirit of it
[52:14] because the letter kills but the spirit
[52:16] giveth life
[52:18] legalism kills legislation kills
[52:21] revelation gives life revelation
[52:24] liberates you you would desire for
[52:27] someone to do by revelation
[52:29] not by education we don't educate people
[52:32] anything it's education
[52:34] legislation and legalism that creates uh
[52:36] horrible group dynamics where everyone's
[52:38] just doing it because when we read last
[52:40] time i'd better go to church or i'll be
[52:41] considered a backslider
[52:43] horrible horrible dynamics do you want
[52:46] people to willingly give willingly
[52:48] participate willingly
[52:49] uh act and it has to be done by
[52:51] revelation he says the letter killeth
[52:53] but the spirit giveth life
[52:55] you realize if we make this application
[52:56] to jesus christ
[52:58] those that knew the letter the best are
[53:00] the ones that put them to death
[53:04] and they crucified them by the letter
[53:06] they they said he was
[53:07] guilty according to the letter but they
[53:09] missed the spirit
[53:10] of the letter that said this is the one
[53:12] who brings you life
[53:14] search the scripture they are the ones
[53:15] that testify of me
[53:21] so the pharisee or the priest and the
[53:24] levite
[53:26] although technically in compliance
[53:29] violated the spirit
[53:31] of the law the spirit of the word
[53:36] i use these things to express to you
[53:38] that the word is our answer
[53:40] yes as we read already from the church
[53:43] age book
[53:46] page 360 now paragraph five it says in
[53:49] his own personal life speaking of jesus
[53:51] contending with himself
[53:54] that's not the bible teach us that as a
[53:56] son learned he obedies by the things
[53:57] which he suffered
[53:59] we recognize this process that the son
[54:01] went through he learned
[54:03] obedience by the things which he
[54:04] suffered in his own personal life
[54:07] this is a very you know try to lift this
[54:11] sentence up this is a heavy sentence in
[54:12] his own personal life he had a personal
[54:14] life
[54:14] contending with himself he said content
[54:18] with himself what do you think was
[54:19] happening in the garden
[54:20] of gethsemane he says
[54:24] let this cup pass from me
[54:28] that he expresses his will his desire
[54:30] agonizing with it he says nevertheless
[54:32] thy will be done there was a wrestling
[54:36] that he engaged in in his life
[54:38] there was there was things that he that
[54:39] things that he wrestled with and content
[54:41] and with contending with himself and his
[54:43] own personal life he overcame by
[54:45] obedience to
[54:46] the word how is it then we can overcome
[54:49] in our own personal lives
[54:51] contending with ourselves continuing
[54:53] with our own worst enemy
[54:55] we do it by obedience to the word of god
[55:00] turn with me to back to our text in
[55:02] ephesians chapter 4
[55:04] verses 17 to 32 i just want to read it
[55:08] again just as we did in the beginning
[55:12] because notice how paul now is
[55:14] instructing us
[55:16] this is giving us very simple tools that
[55:19] we can use
[55:21] that combat the weaknesses of our flesh
[55:25] that oppose these tendencies the devices
[55:27] these mechanics in our minds
[55:29] that cause us to do things incorrectly
[55:32] this i say therefore and testify in the
[55:34] lord that ye henceforth walk not
[55:36] as other gentiles walk in the vanity of
[55:39] their mind
[55:40] so we ought not to be walking as
[55:42] gentiles walk who only have their human
[55:44] mind their human
[55:46] um the nature they received by parents
[55:49] the nurture they received within their
[55:50] society
[55:51] they walk in the vanity of their mind it
[55:52] says having the understanding darkened
[55:55] being alienated from the life of god
[55:56] through the ignorance that is in them
[55:58] because of the blindness of their heart
[56:00] who being past feeling
[56:02] have given themselves over to
[56:03] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[56:05] with greediness
[56:07] this this has fallen humanity
[56:10] their understanding is dark and darkened
[56:12] because they're alienated from the life
[56:14] of god
[56:15] their ignorance is alien their hearts
[56:16] are blinded they're past
[56:18] feeling they don't have discernment they
[56:20] don't have sensitivity to the spirit
[56:22] and because they have this and they've
[56:24] given themselves over to live
[56:25] unrighteously
[56:26] to follow the lust of the flesh the lust
[56:28] of the eyes and the pride of life he
[56:29] said this is how you live when you're
[56:31] carnal
[56:32] this is how you live when you follow
[56:33] your base instincts he's saying don't
[56:35] live that way don't walk that way this
[56:38] prejudice you have in your heart
[56:40] these these ideas you have of others the
[56:42] this parent this view that you have this
[56:44] very narrow view you have of church
[56:45] and relationships he said get rid of all
[56:47] the vanity get rid of all the pride get
[56:49] rid of all the strife he says because
[56:51] you have not so
[56:52] learned christ verse 20.
[56:57] he says you have learned him differently
[57:00] if you've heard him and have been taught
[57:01] him
[57:02] as the truth isn't jesus taught what
[57:05] learned what verse 22 that you put off
[57:08] concerning the former conversation the
[57:11] old man
[57:12] which is corrupt according to the
[57:14] deceitful lust
[57:16] you know what your job is put off the
[57:18] old man
[57:19] be careful how you say it they think you
[57:20] may be talking bad about your dad
[57:23] but your job all of us our job is put
[57:25] off the old man
[57:27] i'm taking off the old man every day
[57:30] lord
[57:30] i want to put him off every day i want
[57:33] to push him away
[57:35] every day put off the old man the former
[57:37] conversation the
[57:38] former life which was corrupt according
[57:40] to the deceitfulness the lust that laid
[57:41] within your members the mindset the
[57:43] attitudes the tendencies
[57:44] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[57:47] mind
[57:49] transforming power quickening power
[57:50] renewing my thought process renewing my
[57:52] thinking my attitude my perceptions my
[57:54] judgments my discernments and that you
[57:56] put on the new man
[57:58] that's our that's our instructions every
[58:00] day put off the old man
[58:02] put on the new man if you want to put on
[58:04] a new body then keep putting off the old
[58:06] man now
[58:08] if you want this body to be changed in a
[58:09] moment and twinkle of an eye then we
[58:10] have a goal we have an objective put on
[58:12] the new character of christ
[58:14] put on the new man which after god is
[58:16] created in righteousness and true
[58:18] wholeness
[58:18] wherefore this is putting away the old
[58:20] man put away lying
[58:22] speak every man truth with his neighbor
[58:24] that's putting on the new man
[58:26] showing us put away the old man put on
[58:28] the new man speak every man truth with
[58:29] his neighbor if we are members one of
[58:31] another
[58:31] be angry and sin not put away the old
[58:33] man put on the new man let not the sun
[58:36] go down
[58:36] upon your wrath neither give place to
[58:39] the devil
[58:39] it's when we hold on to our anger not
[58:41] just being angry but when we hold on to
[58:43] it and we let it fester
[58:44] it gives the devil place to begin to
[58:46] work within that anger to cause division
[58:48] and hardship let him that stole still no
[58:52] more there you are for the thieves
[58:55] but rather let him labor working with
[58:57] his hands the thing which is good that
[58:58] he may
[58:59] have to give to him that needeth putting
[59:01] off the old man put it on the new man
[59:02] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[59:04] of your mouth put off the old man
[59:06] but that which is good to the use of
[59:08] edifying that it may minister grace unto
[59:10] the hears
[59:10] put on the new man and grieve not the
[59:13] holy spirit of god whereby you are
[59:15] sealed
[59:16] unto the day of redemption these
[59:18] instructions are not to a group of
[59:19] people that signed up for a seminar
[59:21] on how to better traverse the social
[59:24] climate
[59:25] this is these are not instructions to
[59:27] people who just wanted to know how to be
[59:29] better social justice warriors or know
[59:31] how to get along with their enemies or
[59:32] you know this is an mlm by the time that
[59:35] paul was done everyone was standing on
[59:36] their
[59:37] seat saying fake it till you make it
[59:38] fake it till you make it
[59:40] that's not what it was all about this
[59:42] was to the the born again
[59:45] why because they're the only ones that
[59:47] could take the old man and put them off
[59:50] and take the new man and put them on
[59:52] everybody else would just be putting
[59:53] makeup on a pig
[59:56] right it's all they'd be doing prettying
[59:58] up the old man
[1:00:00] putting on a wolf in sheep's uh sheep's
[1:00:02] clothing this would have been
[1:00:03] something just to put on something fake
[1:00:06] he says grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:00:08] god wherever you're sealed into the day
[1:00:09] of redemption
[1:00:10] your soul is sealed but you can still
[1:00:12] grieve the holy spirit
[1:00:14] so we we don't want to grieve him he
[1:00:17] says let all bitterness and wrath and
[1:00:18] anger and clamor and evil speaking be
[1:00:20] put away from you with all malice
[1:00:22] this is putting away the old man and be
[1:00:24] kind one to another tenderhearted
[1:00:26] forgiving one another even as god for
[1:00:28] christ's sake hath forgiven you
[1:00:30] putting on the new man you want to know
[1:00:33] how to overcome these devices in our
[1:00:34] hearts
[1:00:35] ephesians 4 put away the old man put
[1:00:38] away his thinking
[1:00:40] ask god to make you more sensitive to
[1:00:43] these reflexes and instincts that we
[1:00:45] have on our heart
[1:00:46] where something happens and immediately
[1:00:50] just be honest with yourselves for a
[1:00:52] moment how how often it creeps in when
[1:00:55] all of a sudden and i
[1:00:56] try to think of maybe a benign scenario
[1:00:57] to where nobody's like oh well that was
[1:00:59] really rude
[1:01:00] but where something you're planning
[1:01:02] something you're wanting to do something
[1:01:03] and then all of a sudden you find out
[1:01:05] that somebody said something or
[1:01:06] something happened
[1:01:07] and your instinct is well i'm just going
[1:01:08] to disinvite them
[1:01:10] they're not they're not welcome to come
[1:01:12] over and what is it the old man
[1:01:16] you immediately you immediately begin to
[1:01:18] think how can i take control over this
[1:01:19] situation again how can i manipulate it
[1:01:21] how can i maneuver it how can i
[1:01:23] uh put them to shame how can i navigate
[1:01:26] this situation where my
[1:01:27] my pride isn't offended where i can
[1:01:29] reassert my dominance and immediately
[1:01:31] you're thinking like the old man
[1:01:33] and what you need to realize is wait a
[1:01:35] minute that's old stinking thinking
[1:01:38] no that's that's the way that's the way
[1:01:40] i used to think no uh-uh i don't think
[1:01:42] that way anymore
[1:01:44] i'm putting on the new man i'm gonna
[1:01:46] think differently
[1:01:47] lord give me wisdom how to traverse this
[1:01:49] situation with this person
[1:01:50] because i don't know the right thing to
[1:01:51] do lord in the times past what i would
[1:01:54] have done
[1:01:55] is i would have stiff-armed him i would
[1:01:57] have given him the cold shoulder i would
[1:01:58] have alienated him i would have
[1:01:59] withdrawn myself
[1:02:00] i would have ostracized him i would have
[1:02:02] ignored him
[1:02:04] lord show me show me how to navigate
[1:02:07] this give me wisdom
[1:02:08] i want to put off the old man i want to
[1:02:10] put on the new man
[1:02:12] sister elizabeth if you'd come i'd like
[1:02:15] to end with this statement
[1:02:17] it's a prayer brother branham prays at
[1:02:19] the end of god's power to transform
[1:02:20] actions
[1:02:21] it's a towards the very end there
[1:02:25] he says god he's praying god transform
[1:02:27] us today
[1:02:29] by your power by the renewing of our
[1:02:32] mind
[1:02:36] to turn from the meager elements of this
[1:02:39] world now
[1:02:40] and to the word of god if you could just
[1:02:43] realize whatever
[1:02:45] whatever you have in the world
[1:02:49] that is not subject to god
[1:02:55] is meager regardless of how big the
[1:02:59] talent is
[1:03:00] or how wonderful the skill if it's not
[1:03:03] subject to the word it's meager what's
[1:03:07] the song we sing little as much if god
[1:03:08] is in it
[1:03:11] it's the it's the little if god's in it
[1:03:13] that's greater than all the
[1:03:15] big meager things that we have in our
[1:03:17] lives turn from the meagre elements of
[1:03:19] this world
[1:03:20] under the word of god that's how we're
[1:03:21] transformed and may we be renewed by the
[1:03:24] transforming power of god
[1:03:25] upon the seed that's in our hearts that
[1:03:27] we believe unto creatures called sons
[1:03:30] and daughters of god
[1:03:30] this is my prayer to you father for the
[1:03:32] people in jesus name he says amen
[1:03:36] this this is our prayer this is your
[1:03:38] prayer this is my prayer yes this is
[1:03:40] your prayer

[1:03:46] just play in church this is why you're
[1:03:48] not satisfied with religion
[1:03:49] you want to be transformed you know
[1:03:52] there's more
[1:03:53] and the the more is the seed of god
[1:03:56] inside if he hasn't been born again by
[1:03:57] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:58] it's always going to be crying out to be
[1:04:01] quickened
[1:04:02] crying out for expression the seed cries
[1:04:04] out for expression
[1:04:05] and that's the desire to see a seed
[1:04:07] surrendered to god through the baptism
[1:04:09] almost be quick and delight and then
[1:04:11] we're transformed into the image
[1:04:13] of sons and daughters of god turning
[1:04:15] away from the meagre elements of this
[1:04:17] world

[1:05:47] the same old same old lord i pray that
[1:05:51] you would meet them where they are right
[1:05:52] now father
[1:05:56] lord it might even be that we're so long
[1:05:59] been trapped
[1:06:01] into this attitude in this mindset
[1:06:06] that we're like that bird that was
[1:06:07] chained to a post
[1:06:10] that walked the same circle for so long
[1:06:12] that once the cord was
[1:06:14] broke he didn't know he was free
[1:06:18] may there be a soul that hears the cry
[1:06:20] today that they're free they're free
[1:06:23] and they can go free from the circle
[1:06:26] treading upon the same thing
[1:06:28] time and time again may they go free
[1:06:30] lord i pray tonight
[1:06:32] for those that are here the those that
[1:06:33] would be streaming
[1:06:35] lord there's just a tremendous sense of
[1:06:38] need right now father
[1:06:39] and i pray that we would look to you and
[1:06:41] to you alone and take this into our
[1:06:42] bosom
[1:06:43] that obedience to the word of god is the
[1:06:45] answer
[1:06:46] that where you have spoken we must say
[1:06:48] amen where you have asked us to step we
[1:06:50] must step
[1:06:51] what you have called us to do we must do
[1:06:53] and we cannot rationalize we cannot make
[1:06:54] excuses
[1:06:55] we cannot self-justify let us act
[1:06:58] now lord according to your word to do
[1:07:00] that which you have told us to do
[1:07:03] stand up upon a promise that if we're in
[1:07:05] your will you will keep us
[1:07:07] so father i pray for the hands that were
[1:07:09] raised the hearts behind it the need
[1:07:11] that's represented by it
[1:07:12] that you'd help them strengthen them
[1:07:14] encourage them
[1:07:16] and take this service lord as we've
[1:07:17] ministered from the word
[1:07:20] take it and edify your people
[1:07:23] and may you be glorified we ask it in
[1:07:26] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:28] amen bless the lord
