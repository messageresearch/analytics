[0:00] my title this morning is going to be a
[0:01] humble home and we'll hopefully touch on
[0:05] a few things that could give that some
[0:07] perspective but in using this phrase a
[0:10] humble home I wanting to maybe conjure
[0:13] up some thoughts within your mind and a
[0:15] particular attitude maybe that you could
[0:17] begin to consider and we are magnifying
[0:19] very specific characteristics of what we
[0:21] would call a home not just a house or a
[0:23] dwelling but an actual home could have
[0:26] just as easily named this part three of
[0:28] a home of Honor and uh really um kind of
[0:32] went back and forth on a few different
[0:33] titles I don't know why I was resisting
[0:35] just using a part three but just seemed
[0:37] that it wasn't clicking for me but we
[0:39] are just picking up where we had to
[0:40] leave off last Sunday morning with a
[0:42] little bit of review but in that home of
[0:44] Honor we were looking at the
[0:46] characteristics of honesty um no
[0:48] hypocrisy where there's no pretense and
[0:51] drawing from this uh Parable and how
[0:54] that Jesus is using the Pharisee as an
[0:58] example or he's addressing their
[0:59] covetous attitude so there's a lot
[1:01] that's being expressed there's things
[1:02] that we've looked at in terms of
[1:04] financial decisions or even transactions
[1:06] that we're making so there's a lot that
[1:08] may have to do with uh just uh greed and
[1:11] lust for money and possessions but then
[1:14] it it's maybe in a bigger context it's
[1:16] just an overall attitude and feeling
[1:18] towards one another and people uh one of
[1:20] the themes that I've been studying and
[1:22] probably get into in the next few
[1:24] Services has just been kind of
[1:25] summarized in my mind is just just be
[1:27] nice we need just be nice if people were
[1:30] nice and so that's maybe part of what's
[1:32] in this uh thought on a home of honor
[1:34] and a humble home I'm sure you've heard
[1:37] the phrase uh a humble abode and it
[1:39] might be something that we use welcome
[1:41] to my humble abode or we might refer to
[1:43] something in that way but uh when we
[1:45] think of a humble home or a humble house
[1:47] or a humble AB boat I think we're uh
[1:49] maybe naturally just thinking in terms
[1:50] of Optics that oh that that's a simple
[1:53] home and it's a it's unpretentious and
[1:55] there you know it's not off-putting or
[1:57] you know a lot of gingerbread or just
[1:59] things that make make it look really
[2:00] really nice but just something that's
[2:01] modest and so modesty uh Simplicity and
[2:06] that word Simplicity the Simplicity of
[2:08] Christ is actually a really deep subject
[2:11] uh it's also that just humility it's my
[2:13] humble abode it's something that's just
[2:14] a welcoming it's inviting uh it's simple
[2:17] it's modest and and so that's my uh
[2:21] those are the things I'm hoping to kind
[2:23] of track a little bit this morning in
[2:25] the thought on a humble home now if you
[2:27] could just uh recall the script
[2:29] scriptures that we've read I won't go
[2:31] back over these but I'd like to bring
[2:32] back to your remembrance this parable of
[2:35] Devas and Lazarus and how that in this
[2:39] Parable that we just wrote Jesus is
[2:40] addressing that self-serving
[2:42] self-preserving mindset of the Pharisees
[2:45] and even this behavior that was in this
[2:47] certain rich man to where he had a lot
[2:50] of wealth he had a lot of opportunity
[2:51] but he didn't use that for anyone else's
[2:53] benefit he only did it for himself and
[2:56] so we're dealing with selfishness and to
[2:58] be selfish is you care only about about
[3:00] yourself you're devoted to only yourself
[3:02] and you're only concerned with your own
[3:04] interest uh it's a self-devotion it's
[3:07] actually a quite a remarkable thought to
[3:09] think of one who's devoted to themselves
[3:11] and so when you're selfish you care only
[3:13] about your own interest you're only
[3:15] concerned about your own needs and we're
[3:17] kind of we're wanting to contrast that
[3:19] with being selfless which is you're
[3:22] concerned with the needs of others
[3:24] you're concerned about the desires of
[3:25] others and really in some ways more than
[3:28] your own now you're concerned about this
[3:31] person's needs more than your own needs
[3:33] you're concerned about this person's
[3:34] situation more than your own
[3:36] situation and and there's a thought
[3:38] where you say well then what about me
[3:40] who's worried about me well that's I
[3:42] think that's what feeds the selfishness
[3:44] is when nobody is giving the other
[3:46] person the benefit of the doubt of maybe
[3:48] they're looking after me so if I look
[3:50] out after them we're all covered and so
[3:52] it is something that we should strive
[3:55] for in not being selfish but being
[3:58] selfless and I was studying for some
[4:00] time last year and the Lord was just
[4:03] dealing with me on some things I think
[4:04] it might fit uh coming up just on
[4:07] altruism and this new philosophy that
[4:09] kind of came out the last couple decades
[4:12] of effective altruism where there's uh
[4:15] you know we want to put our resources
[4:17] and money and efforts behind the things
[4:19] that do the greatest good for the
[4:20] greatest number of people and there's
[4:24] you'll even find that even in a lot of
[4:26] these uh movements and ideas where they
[4:28] they recognize needs and they want to
[4:30] address them uh that it falls short that
[4:32] there's something that they're not
[4:33] taking into consideration and I only
[4:35] surface this that to say this that
[4:38] Christianity is the best way to live
[4:41] this the the word of God it covers all
[4:44] the efforts of effective altruism or
[4:46] those who who are looking after you know
[4:48] who are worried about climate change and
[4:49] those who are worried about economies
[4:51] and all those things if you really just
[4:52] fully if we could all fully embrace the
[4:54] principle of scripture and we could all
[4:57] Embrace Jesus Christ the economics would
[4:59] be fine the climate would be fine uh the
[5:01] poor would be looked after there's just
[5:03] the the word of God is the solution and
[5:05] the word of God addresses all sorts of
[5:07] biases and instincts and jealousies and
[5:10] and and lust and it really is the best
[5:13] way to
[5:15] live and so there
[5:17] is uh in this Parable in Luke chapter 16
[5:21] of Devas and Lazarus we're using Devas
[5:24] as the the the Latin for a certain rich
[5:28] man they
[5:30] it is a Pharisee attitude that's being
[5:32] addressed and Jesus identified the
[5:34] Pharisees with hypocrisy where there
[5:37] were certain things that they would do
[5:39] outwardly for their own benefit their
[5:41] own reputation and they're not so much
[5:43] concerned about the positive impact it
[5:46] has on other people or even worse the
[5:49] negative impact that that might have on
[5:51] people where there's this pretense there
[5:53] show and and this is why I'm doing it to
[5:55] make myself look good not to make you
[5:57] feel better about yourself or to do
[5:59] anything that might encourage you but
[6:00] it's just a selfish interest and we see
[6:04] that this certain rich man even when he
[6:06] is in Hell he's concerned only with
[6:09] himself even in hell he looks up and he
[6:11] sees Lazarus and he knows him by name
[6:14] and he he's able to call out to him and
[6:16] he sees that he's in heaven and I
[6:17] believe Jesus structured it that way to
[6:19] make this point that in Hell he's still
[6:22] only concerned about his thirst his
[6:24] torment so he says have mercy on me have
[6:26] Lazarus just dip his finger in some
[6:28] water and then come visit me in the
[6:31] flames and relieve me of my torment and
[6:34] he's clearly only concerned about
[6:35] himself because he doesn't even think
[6:37] about what those ramifications might be
[6:39] for Lazarus whether or not he could
[6:41] cross over into hell and relieve him of
[6:44] this torment and make his way back or
[6:47] what that might mean to torment Lazarus
[6:49] he didn't care about Lazarus he only
[6:51] concerned he was only concerned with
[6:54] himself now Jesus gives this parable of
[6:57] the rich man and the beggar after after
[6:59] he has given a parable about an unjust
[7:02] Steward and when he gives the parable of
[7:03] the unjust Steward it's to that that the
[7:05] Pharisees who were Covetous uh derided
[7:08] him and then Jesus kind of zeros in on
[7:10] that read knowing their thoughts and he
[7:13] is challenging that Pharisee religion
[7:16] and that idea through this parable of
[7:18] the beggar and the rich man but he's
[7:21] still building off of the thought of the
[7:23] unjust Steward and if we did take time
[7:26] to go back and read it we find that
[7:27] there was a rich man who had a a
[7:30] steward that he threatened to fire
[7:33] unless he could show in his accounts
[7:34] that he was doing what he should and the
[7:36] steward went and made deals with the
[7:38] debtors so that he could be looked after
[7:41] once he was fired so he knew he was
[7:43] toast he knew he was going to get cooked
[7:44] so he made some deals with these vendors
[7:46] so that they would have mercy on him
[7:48] whenever he was fired and maybe he would
[7:49] have a place to stay he'd have a means
[7:51] of income and he says himself in the
[7:53] parable I don't want to work hard and
[7:55] I'm Too Proud to Beg so I need to take
[7:58] advantage of my master in order to gain
[8:00] favor with his debtors so that I can be
[8:03] taken care of once I lose my job and we
[8:06] see that he acted selfishly he acted in
[8:09] his own interest he was self-serving in
[8:11] his uh methods he was protecting himself
[8:14] in what he did he wasn't trying to
[8:16] increase his master's bottom line nor
[8:18] was he trying to do the debtor any
[8:20] favors he was only looking out after
[8:22] himself not concerned about what those
[8:25] ramifications might be for his employer
[8:27] not concerned about what those
[8:28] ramifications may have meant to the
[8:30] clients he was only looking after
[8:32] himself so both in the rich man and the
[8:35] unjust Steward they never looked beyond
[8:37] themselves only concerned with
[8:39] themselves their own interest their own
[8:41] needs at the expense of others needs and
[8:45] we were looking at this last Sunday on
[8:47] how these Parables teach us and Christ
[8:50] is teaching us that we should not live
[8:51] for our solely for our own benefit that
[8:55] the decisions we make the life we live
[8:57] the way that we uh uh conduct ourselves
[9:01] should we should take into consideration
[9:03] other people when we're acting and Jesus
[9:07] is very being very specific to those who
[9:09] have don't use what you have solely for
[9:11] yourself but use it and share it for the
[9:13] benefit of others be generous with what
[9:16] God has given you the scripture has been
[9:18] used quite a bit lately and we used it
[9:20] last Sunday 1 Timothy chapter 6: 17 and
[9:23] 18 charge them that are rich in this
[9:25] world that they be not high-minded nor
[9:27] trust in uncertainty riches this ought
[9:31] to be a comfort to all of us rich people
[9:33] who are here today that if we're rich
[9:35] we're not going straight to hell but we
[9:37] have specific charges that we ought to
[9:40] not be arrogant presumptuous that we not
[9:42] be lifted up or trust in the riches that
[9:46] we have but trust in the Living God and
[9:49] recognize that it's the Living God who
[9:52] has given us these riches to enjoy
[9:55] because God gives us richly all things
[9:58] to enjoy and have him having given to us
[10:01] all things to enjoy all things that we
[10:04] have are his and we're looking out after
[10:07] them as stewards and therefore we we
[10:09] look at our time we look at our money we
[10:11] look at our relationships we look at our
[10:13] possessions and we ought to have some
[10:15] pride of ownership I think is is good in
[10:17] some respects but also maybe in a better
[10:20] way of thinking God's given me this car
[10:22] God's given me this house God's given me
[10:24] this church or he's given me this health
[10:26] given me this body giving me these
[10:27] opportunities giving me this job and we
[10:30] should look out after them as stewards
[10:33] whatever you do do it with your whole
[10:34] heart do it as unto the Lord uh don't do
[10:37] halfway jobs if you if God has given you
[10:39] a job and sometimes we T oh God gave me
[10:41] this great job and we don't do it well
[10:44] and so who are we disrespecting at the
[10:46] end of day well I'm still getting paid
[10:47] and I this is a union job I don't have
[10:49] to worry about this well who gets the
[10:52] glory in
[10:53] that and so there are God giving us
[10:57] these things we are stewards over these
[10:59] things
[11:00] and those that are rich are charged that
[11:03] they do good now it's not that we all of
[11:06] us poor people are thinking I'm not po
[11:08] I'm not rich so I don't have to do good
[11:11] he's actually telling them with do good
[11:13] with your wealth go do good with your
[11:16] privilege or your opportunity and be
[11:18] rich in Good Works be ready to
[11:20] distribute willing to communicate if we
[11:22] could have just summarized it maybe in
[11:24] modern day language don't be
[11:27] selfish don't be selfish but be selfless
[11:31] if God has given you certain resources
[11:33] given you time certain advantages and
[11:35] certain opportunities don't use them
[11:37] solely to advance yourself and don't use
[11:39] them to make yourself look good there's
[11:41] a reason why I think a lot of this is
[11:43] kind of prefaced with the image of the
[11:45] the the Pharisee who would do good but
[11:48] only to make himself look good and so a
[11:51] lot of it was for pretense and self
[11:53] advancement but there should be this
[11:55] attitude to where with what God has
[11:57] given me with what I have in my hand
[11:59] with what opportunities and resources I
[12:01] have and and I'm being very uh
[12:04] deliberate in using that phrase and say
[12:06] you guys who have money and you who make
[12:08] six figures and you who have this and
[12:10] you who have your house paid off and you
[12:12] who don't have a car payment I I'm not
[12:14] so much I'm not interested in in the
[12:17] cash aspect or or the money aspect but
[12:20] in the totality of time and energy and
[12:22] effort and all sorts of opportunities
[12:25] that would be an umbrella for all things
[12:27] Leo DEA everything that we're rich in
[12:29] everything that we're increased in we
[12:31] ought to be selfless and not selfish
[12:34] with
[12:35] it now that that concludes review
[12:38] portion and I
[12:40] apologize I I I don't think it does it
[12:42] justice as I believe the Lord was really
[12:44] with us last Sunday and had a uh some
[12:47] very specific things to address and I
[12:49] trust that you were able to catch that
[12:52] now in Luke chapter 16 as we've been
[12:54] looking at these two Parables and and
[12:55] looking at these uh almost the entire
[12:57] chapter chist Christ introduces us to a
[13:01] certain rich man Devas a man of
[13:03] privilege a man of opportunity but he
[13:06] was
[13:08] selfish later Jesus is approached by a
[13:12] certain ruler this is right where I
[13:14] stopped on Sunday and brother Branham
[13:17] takes him in the message leadership and
[13:19] some other places and he uses the story
[13:21] of the Rich Young Ruler and he connects
[13:24] it to this rich man in the parable of
[13:26] Lazarus and the rich man and he he uh
[13:29] goes to Great Lengths to say that the
[13:31] Rich Young Ruler is the the rich man
[13:35] that we later on see in hell and so we
[13:38] see this younger Devas faced with a
[13:40] decision something's obviously turning
[13:42] over in his heart something is uh he's
[13:45] confronted with the question of eternal
[13:46] life as how brother Brandon phrases it
[13:49] and he has to satisfy this conviction or
[13:51] this burden so he's going to address it
[13:52] and I want you to as we kind of go
[13:55] forward in the Bible we're going
[13:57] backwards in the life of Devas
[14:00] if does that make sense going to go back
[14:02] to the future here and we're going to be
[14:04] going forward in scripture but when we
[14:06] go forward in scripture we're actually
[14:08] seeing this rich man who whose gate
[14:11] Lazarus laid at and was disregarded who
[14:14] disregarded Lazarus we're going to see
[14:15] him in real life and in Luke chapter 18:
[14:18] 18 but if you want to turn to Mark
[14:20] chapter 10 it says in Luke chapter 18 so
[14:22] as we read in Luke 16 if you get to 18
[14:25] that's where you'll see uh this ruler's
[14:27] Love of Money come to into into being it
[14:30] says that he comes to Christ he says
[14:32] good Master what shall I do to inherit
[14:35] eternal life one thing I was wrestling
[14:38] with uh last week was this notion of
[14:41] what can I do to inherit an inheritance
[14:44] is not necessarily earned and
[14:45] inheritances sometimes are typically
[14:48] based upon relationship or something
[14:50] that's given and not necessarily
[14:51] something that is earned and so I don't
[14:55] know if it was just the translation and
[14:56] I think maybe it was deliberate but it's
[14:58] what shall I do to inherit eternal life
[15:01] so he wanted to do something but maybe
[15:04] he didn't think he deserved it or he was
[15:06] wanting to do something but he didn't
[15:08] want to have to work too hard I'm not
[15:09] sure why he says what can I do to
[15:11] inherit but it reeks of the pharisaic
[15:14] religion or attitude of what can I
[15:17] do a and being concerned with external
[15:21] rules and the outward Merit of something
[15:23] what can I do to inherit eternal life so
[15:27] we realize that there's something centr
[15:29] but he maybe there's something he thinks
[15:31] he can Merit or do and the way that you
[15:34] inherit typically is by
[15:36] relationship and you become a son you
[15:39] don't do something you become you're
[15:40] you're born again into the kingdom of
[15:42] God and therefore you become an heir
[15:44] there's nothing that you do per se now
[15:46] in Mark 10: 17-31 I hope to just read
[15:50] through this and make a much better
[15:52] progress than we did last time and when
[15:55] he was gone forth into the way there
[15:57] came one running and kneeled to him and
[15:59] asked him good Master what shall I do
[16:01] that I may inherit eternal life this is
[16:05] we call him the Rich Young
[16:07] Ruler this is Devas in
[16:10] preview Jesus has already given these
[16:13] Parables of the unjust Steward and the
[16:14] rich man and the beggar so these things
[16:16] are already in his teaching but now we
[16:18] see a real life example of what he was
[16:20] talking about why callest thou me good
[16:23] there's none good but one that is God
[16:26] thou knowest the Commandments do not
[16:27] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[16:29] do not bear false witness defraud not
[16:31] honor thy father and mother and I
[16:33] believe it's in the Book of Matthew
[16:34] where he says and love thy neighbor as
[16:36] thyself is added to
[16:39] it and the this ruler answers and said
[16:44] and he's a certain ruler is what he's
[16:46] referred to in Luke chapter 18 answers
[16:49] and says master all these have I
[16:51] observed from my youth that's quite a
[16:54] statement then Jesus beholding him loved
[16:56] him and said one thing thou lackest
[16:59] go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[17:02] give to the poor now if you
[17:05] could really I know we're reading
[17:08] through this but wrestle with the text
[17:10] here Jesus tells him uh you know the
[17:15] Commandments uh elicits them the Rich
[17:18] Young Ruler says I have observed all of
[17:22] these and I remember what many many
[17:25] years ago a couple decades ago I
[17:26] remember preaching and said I made the
[17:27] comment well I think this it seems to me
[17:29] like he's lying and uh it opened up
[17:32] quite a a discussion and debate for some
[17:34] time with the host Pastor on how being a
[17:37] liar was probably the worst thing that
[17:38] you could be and for me to accuse him of
[17:40] being a liar was was treacherous and so
[17:42] I'm not saying he's a liar but it's hard
[17:45] to believe right that he loved his
[17:47] neighbor as himself that he was doing
[17:48] everything that he ought to do and he
[17:50] was H uh that he fully had complied but
[17:53] let's just give him the benefit of the
[17:54] doubt because Jesus doesn't call him out
[17:56] on it but he just says one thing you
[17:58] lack
[17:59] okay you've done great you've observed
[18:00] all the Commandments you're not lying
[18:02] you're telling the truth but you still
[18:04] lack one thing sell everything that you
[18:06] have and give to the poor now that
[18:09] phrase sell what you have and give to
[18:11] the poor now he's not telling us to do
[18:13] that necessarily and we could say thank
[18:15] goodness uh but he's but this is a
[18:18] challenge to this man and says sell all
[18:20] you have and give to the poor it must
[18:22] have struck at the core of something in
[18:24] this rich man's heart because because of
[18:27] his later response but notice how Jesus
[18:29] then defines or
[18:32] amplifies what this means to sell all
[18:35] you have and give to the poor what the
[18:36] effect is because he says what shall I
[18:38] do to inherit eternal life I believe
[18:40] that Christ is hitting on this he says
[18:43] and if you sell what you have and give
[18:45] to the poor and thou shalt have treasure
[18:49] in
[18:50] heaven the treasure in heaven was
[18:52] directly reflected upon how he would use
[18:54] what he was given in this life his
[18:57] riches if he was to sell them and give
[18:59] it to the for the benefit of the poor
[19:01] sell all his possessions and give to the
[19:03] poor that that would be a transaction
[19:05] that would Merit him blessing or
[19:07] Treasures in Heaven and as a ruler this
[19:10] ought to be if he's seeking after
[19:11] eternal life and he's saying I what can
[19:14] I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus
[19:16] not necessarily a head fake but says
[19:18] well you know the Commandments and did
[19:20] have you done all the Commandments he
[19:21] says yes so he says well then one thing
[19:23] you lack to have eternal life is stop
[19:26] living selfishly live for for others
[19:29] which is perfectly eternal life and
[19:31] you'll be investing in Eternal Treasures
[19:34] you will be investing in eternal
[19:37] life sell whatever you have and give to
[19:40] the poor that is how we uh make
[19:43] investments in heaven that is how we
[19:44] have Treasures in Heaven and then he
[19:47] says and come take up the cross and
[19:49] follow me we'll revisit that phrase
[19:52] because it wasn't the one thing he
[19:54] lacked is resolved by selling everything
[19:57] he has giving to the poor
[19:59] following Christ taking up the cross and
[20:00] following
[20:02] Christ and he was sad this Devas as we
[20:06] would see him as a young man was sad at
[20:08] that saying and went away grieved for he
[20:11] had great
[20:13] possessions Jesus looked round about and
[20:15] say saith unto his disciples how hardly
[20:18] shall they that have riches enter into
[20:20] the kingdom of God the disciples were
[20:23] astonished at his words but Jesus
[20:24] answered again and saith unto them
[20:26] children how hard is it for them that
[20:28] trust in riches to enter into the
[20:31] kingdom of God so there's the trust the
[20:33] Reliance upon the comfort and the
[20:36] Leisure that wealth can give the
[20:39] complacency that one can develop
[20:41] perceiving them to be the blessings of
[20:43] God or trusted in them that they'll
[20:45] always be able to get them out of
[20:47] trouble say is it easier for a camel to
[20:49] go through the eye of a needle than for
[20:51] a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[20:53] God and they were astonished out of
[20:55] measure saying among themselves who then
[20:58] can be saved saved and Jesus looking
[21:00] upon them sayith with men it is
[21:01] impossible but not with God for With God
[21:04] all things are possible it's amazing
[21:06] that statement we often quote at least
[21:09] in this particular phrase in an instance
[21:11] is in response to the possibility of a
[21:14] rich man entering into heaven a Rich Man
[21:17] Without God is not going to enter into
[21:20] heaven With God all things are possible
[21:23] then Peter began to say unto him Lo we
[21:25] have left all and have followed thee
[21:28] there's this uh connection maybe to what
[21:31] he asked the Rich Young Ruler to do to
[21:33] sell everything you have and come follow
[21:35] me Peter's saying well we've left
[21:37] everything we've abandoned everything to
[21:38] follow you and Jesus answered and and
[21:41] verily I say unto you there's no man
[21:43] that hath left house or brother or
[21:45] sister or father or mother or wife or
[21:46] children or LS for my sake and the
[21:49] gospels so we cannot give away
[21:52] everything that we own for our own sakes
[21:55] we can't do it according to human
[21:57] metrics or just to be effective altruist
[21:59] uh we cannot do it in a carnal way but
[22:02] it's for the gospel's sake for the sake
[22:04] of
[22:05] Christ anyone that has done so shall
[22:08] receive a h hundredfold now in this time
[22:10] houses and Brethren and sisters and
[22:12] mothers and children and lands and with
[22:13] with persecutions and in the world to
[22:16] come eternal life there's the the notion
[22:19] that sacrificing ourselves for the cause
[22:22] of Christ is storing up Treasures in
[22:26] Heaven and he ends this with but many
[22:30] that are first shall be last and the
[22:32] last first quite a phrase especially if
[22:35] you continue to the preceding chapters I
[22:37] think believe it's maybe Matthew chapter
[22:39] uh 19 and 20 where he he amplifies the
[22:43] last and first to the parable of the the
[22:46] the um that 12h hour worker who got a
[22:49] penny just like everyone else a and and
[22:52] he says I need labors I'll pay you a
[22:54] penny to labor in the Harvest that have
[22:56] honor that have opportunities
[22:59] in this life will be impoverished in the
[23:01] life to
[23:02] come the poor the Beggars they will be
[23:06] received into Paradise it's the very
[23:08] image of what took place when he gave
[23:10] the parable in Luke chapter 16 in Luke
[23:13] chapter 18 we see the rich man asking
[23:16] the question being told what he can do
[23:18] to receive eternal life essentially is
[23:20] sell all you have live for Christ
[23:22] abandon yourself to the gospel and he
[23:24] goes away grieved because the Bible says
[23:26] he was very sorrowful for he was very
[23:31] rich and so there's this image now of
[23:34] Devas this rich man in Luke chapter 16
[23:38] and Lazarus this beggar because Jesus
[23:39] says many that are first the rich man is
[23:42] going to be in Hell tormented and the
[23:44] Begger is going to be in the bosom of
[23:46] Abraham he was very sorrowful for he was
[23:49] very rich excessively Rich it is uh it
[23:54] is beyond what was necessary and having
[23:57] riches he trusted in
[23:59] him and having these this trust in
[24:02] riches it cultivated within himself a
[24:04] Reliance on it and a sense of
[24:06] entitlement to it to where he wasn't
[24:07] willing to give it up the Bible doesn't
[24:10] tell us but if Jesus would have said
[24:11] sell all you have uh and and then he
[24:15] could just put that money in the bank it
[24:16] might have been an easy proposition you
[24:19] want me to liquidate my stocks fine I I
[24:21] I'll put it all in cash and I'll just I
[24:23] I'll put it in the bank and I'll earn a
[24:25] little interest on it and I'll follow
[24:26] you and it'll be there when I get back
[24:30] so it I mean this is just me thinking
[24:32] out loud was it the fact that he asked
[24:34] him to give to the
[24:36] poor is that where is that where the rub
[24:39] ultimately was I don't mind getting rid
[24:41] of my stuff but why should I give it to
[24:43] the
[24:44] poor why why should I sell everything
[24:46] that I've earned or that I've received
[24:48] and then let somebody else benefit from
[24:51] my hard work so it it had cultivated
[24:55] this sense of
[24:57] entitlement where
[24:59] he had earned those deserved those they
[25:02] were his and if he was to get rid of
[25:04] them somebody else ought not to benefit
[25:06] from it I myself should benefit and
[25:09] enjoy these riches so he did have an
[25:12] attitude of privilege and I use the word
[25:16] privilege just to trigger some
[25:19] people but Jesus says take up the cross
[25:22] and follow me when he tells him to take
[25:25] up the cross and follow him he has
[25:26] something very specific in mind this
[25:28] this isn't the first time that he used
[25:30] this phrase but he's he he is calling
[25:32] back to something he had said before
[25:34] Mark chapter 8 vers 34- 38 when he had
[25:37] called the people unto him with his
[25:39] disciples also he said unto them
[25:41] whosoever will come after me let him
[25:44] deny himself and take up his cross and
[25:47] follow me for whosoever will save his
[25:50] life shall lose it but whosoever shall
[25:52] lose his life for my sake and the
[25:54] gospels the same shall save it notice
[25:58] just how much that fits with what he was
[26:00] saying in Mark chapter 10 after this
[26:02] Rich Young Ruler personified the very
[26:04] things that he was addressing he says no
[26:06] man has given up these things for my
[26:08] sake in the gospels who will not benefit
[26:11] in this life and the life to come so he
[26:12] says whosoever will lose his life for
[26:16] the sake of the Gospel whoever will lose
[26:18] his life for my sake I how shall have
[26:21] his life
[26:22] preserved for what shall it profit a man
[26:24] if he shall gain the whole world and
[26:26] lose his own soul or what shall a man
[26:29] give in exchange for his
[26:32] soul there's nothing in the the Bible to
[26:36] suggest that this Rich Young Ruler would
[26:38] have heard
[26:39] this but just two chapters later and I
[26:42] didn't do the math to find out how much
[26:43] time had pass but in Mark chapter 10
[26:45] after Jesus has already said what is
[26:47] there what profit is it to a man who
[26:50] gains the world and loses his soul and
[26:53] then the Rich Young Ruler shows up
[26:54] asking the question what can I do to
[26:56] inherit eternal life that that my soul
[26:58] would not be lost and damned to a a
[27:01] permanent death in all eternity Lord
[27:03] what can I do and he's saying you've got
[27:05] to lose your life for my sake and for
[27:08] the
[27:08] gospels let him deny himself and take up
[27:11] his cross this self-denial is what
[27:14] taking up the cross means in order for a
[27:16] man to take up his cross that means he's
[27:18] denying himself certain
[27:20] things he he is humbling himself and
[27:23] submitting himself to something
[27:25] self-denial it's the denial of of of
[27:28] meure is the denial of opportunity for
[27:32] the sake of
[27:34] Christ it could be sad that it's to do
[27:37] God's will regardless of the
[27:39] cost and to deny your own will
[27:41] regardless of what could be
[27:43] gained it would be two do God's will
[27:46] regardless of what it would cost and
[27:48] deny yourself pleasure regardless of the
[27:51] benefit regardless of the gain oh if I
[27:53] do this I stand to gain this but I'm
[27:55] going to deny myself that but I'm als
[27:58] going to submit myself to the will of
[28:00] God there's there is not there's no
[28:03] glory if I could say it this way and
[28:06] maybe my my my mouth is maybe getting
[28:09] ahead of me a little bit but there's no
[28:12] glory in self-denial denying yourself
[28:15] pleasure unless you're doing God's
[28:17] will so again there's this pretense of
[28:20] the Pharisee that if there's some sort
[28:21] of restriction and there's some sort of
[28:23] saying no and there there's some H uh
[28:25] I'm gonna punish myself I'm make a I'm
[28:28] going to do Penance that there's some
[28:29] glory in that but it's we must do God's
[28:32] will regardless of the cost and deny
[28:34] ourselves regardless of what we stood to
[28:36] gain turn away from the self-serving
[28:39] self-preserving behavior and live
[28:43] outwardly live for others so you could
[28:47] not adopt a lifestyle to join a
[28:49] monastery and be a monk and I'm never
[28:51] going to speak again I'm just going to
[28:52] rake a garden a a and I'm going to live
[28:55] this life of solitude to myself and
[28:58] that's for no one's benefit but your
[29:00] own well maybe it depends on how much
[29:02] you talk at
[29:04] home but the idea is you
[29:09] cannot you cannot be unselfish by merely
[29:13] denying yourself Pleasures you must also
[29:16] live for others you must live
[29:19] outwardly in Mark chap excuse me Matthew
[29:21] chapter 11: 28 29 and 30 come unto me
[29:25] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[29:28] and I will give you
[29:29] rest I'm sharing this in light of his
[29:33] prescription to take up the cross his
[29:35] cross of self-denial denying self this
[29:38] is what he told Devas to do take up the
[29:41] cross and follow
[29:43] me and as a ruler what as one with
[29:46] responsibilities and one who was doing
[29:48] things and had great possessions we
[29:49] could maybe surmise that he was a man of
[29:52] opportunity because his he received it
[29:54] or inherited it but yet being young and
[29:56] and the scripture implies that he would
[29:57] have been maybe between uh 20 and 40
[30:00] years old and uh I'd like to say maybe
[30:03] 20 and 50 so I could still be young but
[30:06] there's this idea that he's worked hard
[30:08] for this he has some sort of sense of
[30:09] entitlement or a right to these things
[30:13] and the taking up of the Cross and
[30:14] self-denial notice Jesus says come unto
[30:16] me that labor and are heavy laden and I
[30:18] will give you rest that labor is those
[30:20] that are uh growing weary they're tired
[30:23] they're exhausted there's this heaviness
[30:25] heavy laden it's overburdened and
[30:29] overloaded and I would I would posit
[30:33] that this would perhaps be things that
[30:35] we take upon ourselves or take ownership
[30:38] of that bring us down instead of giving
[30:40] us a sense of meaning or purpose because
[30:43] it's not a question of just being
[30:45] unburdened but it's a question of being
[30:47] appropriately burdened because he says
[30:48] take my yoke upon you those of you who
[30:51] are yolked and overtaxed with your yoke
[30:55] get rid of that yoke and take on a new
[30:57] one he's not saying become yokeless he's
[31:00] saying that yeah you're you're going to
[31:02] always have Labor you're going to have
[31:03] travail but take my yoke and learn of me
[31:07] there's the phrasing learn of me for I
[31:09] am meek and lowly in heart that that
[31:12] meekness that loneliness it's this re
[31:14] Rel this is where you're going to find
[31:15] relief from The Strife of the Yoke this
[31:17] is where you're going to find relief
[31:19] from this overwhelming burden is not to
[31:21] become burden
[31:22] less but to have the right kind of
[31:25] Burden take my yoke upon you and lur to
[31:27] me for I'm meek and lowly in heart and
[31:29] ye shall find rest unto your souls for
[31:33] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[31:37] the yoke is a symbol of service he says
[31:41] take my yoke upon you it's he saying You
[31:44] must be in service you must labor but
[31:47] the Yoke of this world the Yoke of leod
[31:49] DEA the Yoke of greed the Yoke of money
[31:51] the Yoke of possessions the Yoke of of
[31:53] these things that's just going to cause
[31:55] you to be labored and exhausted and
[31:58] tired and overloaded and you're yolked
[32:01] to the wrong things you're driven but
[32:03] driven to do the wrong things you're
[32:05] you're doing and you're working but
[32:07] because you have the wrong yoke you're
[32:09] not receiving the benefit the riches of
[32:12] or the blessings of God are riches and
[32:14] he adds no sorrow to it th in this life
[32:17] we will labor in this life we will work
[32:19] in this life we will have to fight for
[32:21] every inch of ground but if we have the
[32:23] right yoke it isn't the negative impact
[32:26] that the Yoke of this world is
[32:28] is so this yoke take my yoke upon you
[32:32] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[32:35] when he offers us this yoke it's still
[32:38] service it's still work but it's an
[32:39] alternative labor to selfish
[32:43] ambition maybe we could even say that
[32:45] those that labor and are heavy laden
[32:47] haven't yet been yolked they're doing it
[32:49] all on their own they're working they're
[32:51] working for themselves so he offers a
[32:53] yoke that you might be joined to
[32:55] another's task that you might be a
[32:57] servant to him him he's meek and lowly
[32:59] in heart so we submit ourselves to his
[33:01] yoke we're going to learn of him and
[33:02] this is an alternative service and labor
[33:04] to selfish ambition as self-promotion
[33:07] and the commercialism that has our nose
[33:09] to the
[33:12] grindstone and our souls are troubled
[33:15] when we're merely laboring to be
[33:17] rich I if you're working for the
[33:19] paycheck if you're if you're laboring uh
[33:22] for the Optics if there's a lot of
[33:23] things you're doing because you want to
[33:25] do it for yourself and for self-promo
[33:28] and for your own good and even your
[33:30] progy benefit alone and not laboring for
[33:33] the Lord that's when your soul is
[33:36] troubled because he says take my yoke
[33:39] learn of me and you'll find
[33:41] rest remember the scribes and Pharisees
[33:44] prescribed
[33:45] burdens upon the people for pretense and
[33:49] for
[33:50] vanity these burdens therefore were
[33:54] empty but they were the heaviest
[33:58] that when he asks us to take his yoke
[34:00] upon us it's not that it's
[34:01] weightless it is a burden but it's easy
[34:04] and light whereas the Yoke of this world
[34:08] it may be weightless but it's the
[34:10] heaviest of all things without the
[34:12] accountability with the the with the pie
[34:14] in the sky otions that I want to get
[34:16] rich or di Trion with all the different
[34:18] things that we might find ourselves
[34:19] enamored with the scribes and Pharisees
[34:22] prescrib burdens and that Pharisee
[34:24] religion and that way of living that
[34:26] Pharisee hypocritical way of living it's
[34:28] vain but it's the heaviest burden of
[34:31] them
[34:33] all and in Matthew chap 23 verses 10 to1
[34:38] 13 He says neither be you called Masters
[34:41] for one is your master even Christ I've
[34:44] gotten so far away from the first part
[34:46] in this where we dealt a lot with the
[34:47] Pharisees and I hope that some of these
[34:49] scriptures don't get lost we're wanting
[34:51] to use uh Luke 12 and again revisit
[34:54] Matthew chapter 6 and some of these
[34:56] things where he's de ing specifically
[34:59] with the Pharisee attitude and this is
[35:01] what the character of Divas is Divas is
[35:05] that Pharisee religion that Pharisee
[35:09] idea don't be called Master for one is
[35:12] your master even Christ but he that is
[35:15] greatest among you shall be your servant
[35:18] that phrase to me uh stands on its
[35:21] own and whosoever shall exalt himself
[35:24] shall be abased do not read that
[35:27] statement independent of the prior
[35:29] statement he that is greatest among you
[35:32] shall be your servant so there is the
[35:35] the servant but the one who exalts
[35:37] himself is the one who chooses not to
[35:40] serve the one exalts himself is the one
[35:43] who wants to be served so that's what he
[35:45] means by exalting he says learn of me
[35:47] I'm meek and lowly in heart come follow
[35:50] me and do as I would do and take my yoke
[35:52] upon you we have to become
[35:56] servants willing to to serve and
[35:58] whosoever will exalt himself it doesn't
[36:01] mean that you have to go around lording
[36:02] yourself over other people but choose
[36:05] not to serve those are the ones that are
[36:07] based but he that shall humble himself
[36:09] shall be exalted and this humility
[36:11] should not be viewed independent of the
[36:13] prior statement the one who humbles
[36:15] himself is the one who desires to be and
[36:18] becomes the
[36:20] servant so then he says but wo unto you
[36:22] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you
[36:25] shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against
[36:27] men for ye neither go in yourselves
[36:29] neither suffer ye them that are entering
[36:31] to go
[36:32] in they put burdens upon
[36:35] people and and and they require things
[36:37] of people that they're not even able to
[36:39] do to enter the kingdom of God but they
[36:41] themselves aren't even willing to do the
[36:42] very things that they're requiring of
[36:44] the people he calls them
[36:47] Hypocrites the laboring for self-
[36:50] pretense the laboring to to serve self
[36:52] the the the the heavy laden overtax to
[36:56] preserve yourselves to serve yourselves
[36:58] he says he that is greatest among you
[37:00] let him serve
[37:02] others there is zero satisfaction for
[37:06] Christian who live
[37:08] selfishly all everything you gain
[37:10] everything you do will always leave you
[37:12] uh less than satisfied we could get a
[37:15] lot of amens on that and and we've
[37:18] experienced that where it seems like man
[37:19] no matter what I do to get ahead no
[37:21] matter what I seem to accomplish no
[37:23] matter all the blessings I find myself
[37:25] counting in my life that have has to do
[37:28] is connected with some effort on my part
[37:30] or resources or possessions or Vacations
[37:32] or cars or money or opportunities
[37:35] whatever it might be there's always
[37:37] there's always going to be some
[37:40] dissatisfaction in the heart of a
[37:41] Christian when he has done it
[37:44] selfishly so Christ says follow me learn
[37:46] of me in other words take my example I
[37:49] I'm I have afforded you example learn of
[37:52] me is we must take Christ as our example
[37:55] as to how to live G
[37:58] 6:2 he says bear ye one another's
[37:59] burdens be
[38:01] sympathetic consider what somebody else
[38:03] may be going through look at it from
[38:05] their standpoint or their objective
[38:07] their perspective bear ye one another's
[38:10] burdens and so fulfill the law of
[38:11] Christian love fulfill the law of
[38:14] Christ that's quite a statement bear ye
[38:17] one another's burdens and in so doing
[38:18] you will fulfill the law of Christ if
[38:21] there's one law if there's a law of
[38:23] Christ it's fulfilled in bearing one
[38:25] another's burdens what what is being
[38:27] pointed to In
[38:29] This Bear ye one another's
[38:32] burdens it does not necessarily mean
[38:35] that you would every time you see
[38:37] someone with a burden you just try to
[38:38] take it away from them because each one
[38:40] of us are to Bear our own burden so
[38:42] there's a certain thought of our
[38:44] attitude towards others when they're
[38:46] bearing what they ought to Bear where
[38:49] sometimes we shame them we ridicule them
[38:50] we reproach them when they're bearing
[38:53] the burden that they ought to bear and
[38:54] he says bear ye one another's burdens
[38:56] don't be so judg Jud y don't be so
[38:59] critical don't be so quick to condemn
[39:03] but to but put yourself in their shoes
[39:05] be sympathetic be
[39:07] considerate this consideration kindness
[39:10] generosity these are a lot of things
[39:11] I've been thinking about just be nice
[39:13] bear ye one another's burdens and in so
[39:15] doing you will fulfill the law of
[39:19] Christ the law of
[39:22] Christ the Yoke of Christ the burden of
[39:25] Christ
[39:28] come follow me learn of me it says in
[39:31] Philippians chapter 2: 3 to8 let nothing
[39:34] be done through Strife or V Glory but in
[39:36] loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other
[39:39] better than themselves when he said take
[39:42] my yoke and learn of me I am meek and
[39:44] lowly in heart now we're being
[39:46] instructed that we likewise are to do
[39:48] the same let nothing be done through
[39:49] Strife or vain Glory that's self-
[39:52] serving
[39:53] self-protecting but in loneliness of
[39:55] mind what is this to be meek and lowly
[39:57] esteem the other better than yourself
[40:00] look not every man on his own things but
[40:03] every man also on the things of others
[40:05] this is looking outwardly looking Beyond
[40:08] yourself if you could recall that I am
[40:11] specifically addressing home life in
[40:14] this ourselves as a home for Christ our
[40:17] our houses as homes for a family this
[40:19] church so it's an attitude that finds
[40:21] application in your individual living
[40:23] and your interactions with others it
[40:24] finds application within our home life
[40:26] in our relationships to spouses and
[40:28] children and it finds application in the
[40:30] way that we live amongst one another all
[40:32] for the purpose of the impact that we
[40:34] would have on the community at
[40:36] large look not every man on his own
[40:39] things but every man also on the things
[40:40] of others let this mind be in you which
[40:42] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[40:44] the form of God thought it not robbery
[40:46] to be equal with God but made himself of
[40:50] no reputation took upon him the form of
[40:53] a servant I am meek and lowly in heart
[40:56] come learn of me take my yoke and and my
[40:58] burden and he that is greatest among you
[41:01] will be a servant here how he
[41:02] demonstrated this he says he took upon
[41:04] the form of a servant and was made in
[41:06] the likeness of men and being found in
[41:08] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[41:12] became obedient unto death even the
[41:15] death of the
[41:17] Cross by God's grace none of us are
[41:20] being called to literal death of
[41:22] crucifixion upon a cross but we are all
[41:24] to take up the cross take up your cross
[41:27] follow him and we are to have the same
[41:30] mind that was in Christ that we will
[41:32] humble ourselves and become obedient to
[41:35] the death of the cross the death of self
[41:39] self-denial a cross that we likewise
[41:41] must
[41:43] bear Christ humbled
[41:47] himself he uses the example of Christ to
[41:50] encourage Us in the liness of mind the
[41:53] looking on the things of
[41:55] others he's asking us to have some
[41:59] humility and in order to have humility
[42:01] it's not it's not necessarily to be able
[42:04] solely to appreciate what somebody else
[42:06] is going through but to have a a low
[42:08] opinion of yourself at the same
[42:10] time a modest view of your own
[42:12] importance a modest view of your own
[42:17] worth it's the opposite of being a
[42:19] narcissist which I could remember the
[42:21] series I was preaching where I wanted my
[42:23] title to be don't be a
[42:24] narcissist CU that attitude is so vasive
[42:27] anymore to where really it seems like to
[42:29] be a narcissist just means you breathe
[42:32] just becomes so natural we're all humans
[42:34] we're all uh teenagers are are all
[42:36] narcissists babies are narcissist and we
[42:38] just if we don't ever grow up we're just
[42:41] narcissist but to be able to have this
[42:44] mindset there we have this need to have
[42:48] a modest opinion of ourselves because we
[42:50] could be oh I pity that fool oh I feel
[42:52] sorry for that guy and we see
[42:54] everybody's needs and just how pitiful
[42:56] they are I'm I'm I'm sympathetic to them
[42:59] and oh they're ignorant oh they don't
[43:00] know this but really you're you're
[43:03] probably being proud if you are
[43:05] overestimating your own worth and
[43:07] ability that guy's a clown he doesn't
[43:09] know how to do this and that guy doesn't
[43:10] know how to do that and and you're like
[43:12] oh I feel sorry for him I feel feel
[43:13] sorry for him but do you have an
[43:15] inflated view of
[43:19] yourself when we're humble I think this
[43:21] is one thing I I want to find the right
[43:23] way to express this the the the idea
[43:25] that just kept coming to me is you're
[43:26] willing to take take the medicine
[43:28] yourself words you don't have this the
[43:31] answer for everybody else or you just
[43:32] want to tell everybody else what to do
[43:34] or you're not looking at the needs of
[43:35] others and be like oh this is that
[43:37] problem that problem that problem and
[43:38] you want to be the problem solver but
[43:40] you yourself are willing to take the
[43:41] medicine and afford the right
[43:45] example that you're willing when you
[43:48] have a modest opinion of yourself you
[43:50] recognize your own needs will address
[43:51] those needs within yourself the way that
[43:54] I the way that it kept coming back to me
[43:56] is this idea
[43:57] of whenever there's a disagreement
[43:59] between two parties and especially in
[44:01] relationships whether it be a parent to
[44:03] child or among spouses or even just
[44:05] family members a lot of times we don't
[44:07] feel that we're understood and we think
[44:08] if they could just see it from my
[44:10] perspective and if they could just put
[44:11] themselves in my shoes then everything
[44:13] would just resolve itself and as soon as
[44:16] you say that remind yourself that the
[44:18] power is in your hands to do that for
[44:21] them and that would be the humility they
[44:24] they're just judging me they don't
[44:26] understand where I'm coming from this
[44:27] that and the other and you think if they
[44:29] could just understand where I'm coming
[44:31] from and put themselves in my shoes it
[44:33] would diffuse and if you have that
[44:35] thought the chances are you're right the
[44:38] power to diffuse and deescalate is in
[44:40] your hands if you just put yourself in
[44:43] their shoes and take the medicine that
[44:45] you're trying to get them to
[44:47] take that's what it means to be
[44:50] humble that's really what makes a humble
[44:52] home is when we're not just shoving the
[44:55] me medicine in front of someone else his
[44:57] face but we're taking it
[45:03] ourselves I was going to go on a a
[45:07] rabbit Trail about pandemics but I won't
[45:09] do
[45:11] that or maybe I
[45:15] will a lot of times we're asked to do
[45:17] things it's not solely for your own
[45:19] benefit but solely for the benefit of
[45:21] others and as Christians we should be
[45:23] willing to do it even be willing to
[45:26] forsake some of our
[45:28] liberties take up a cross and do it for
[45:31] others
[45:32] sakes to be humble it says that he being
[45:36] in the form of God made himself of no
[45:38] reputation took on the form of a servant
[45:41] he humbled himself though there was a
[45:46] right he had no sense of
[45:49] entitlement Christ whether we look at
[45:52] Paul whether we look at Christ
[45:53] regardless of how we look at this
[45:54] whether it be through the other
[45:55] scriptures
[45:57] there is this
[45:59] encouragement to have the attitude of
[46:02] Christ the Cross of Christ the the the
[46:04] Yoke of Christ the burden of Christ to
[46:06] learn of him to take up the cross is the
[46:09] sense of sacrifice not that you're just
[46:12] killing yourself but you're doing it for
[46:13] someone else's
[46:15] benefit it's an attitude of
[46:18] deferring it's an attitude of respect or
[46:21] fairness one of the things I I keep
[46:23] thinking about a lot is just this idea
[46:24] of being kind and generous it's just
[46:26] just given due
[46:29] consideration there it it's the some of
[46:31] the scriptures I had to share is do unto
[46:34] others as you would have them doing to
[46:35] you Paul even saying that Jesus said
[46:37] it's better to give than to receive and
[46:40] and it's a sense of deferring that what
[46:42] the behavior that you would
[46:44] expect and to where um you would you if
[46:48] you would want to be treated a certain
[46:50] way treat others that
[46:52] way Romans 12:10 says be kindly
[46:55] affectioned one to another with
[46:57] Brotherly
[47:00] Love be genuinely devoted to others it's
[47:04] a genuine be genuinely devoted to each
[47:06] other be kindly affectioned one to
[47:08] another with brotherly love this is this
[47:10] it's authentic in honor preferring one
[47:13] another give
[47:16] preference first to
[47:22] others give others more honor than you
[47:24] would yourself
[47:27] I think I've told this story before but
[47:28] I'm reminded of how two children were
[47:30] told that the cake was ready and the the
[47:33] slices of cake were made available by
[47:35] the mom so that they go running into the
[47:36] house and uh the older one got there
[47:39] first and there was two slices of cake
[47:41] and one was bigger than the other so he
[47:42] grabbed the bigger one and the younger
[47:43] one showed up and said well if I would
[47:46] have got here first I would have given
[47:47] you the bigger one and so the older
[47:50] brother said well then you got what you
[47:51] wanted anyways what are you complaining
[47:54] about it it worked out you know I just
[47:57] cut out some
[47:58] steps and and there was this in that
[48:02] would be the idea the little ones
[48:03] thinking well I would have given you the
[48:05] big piece if I got here first because I
[48:08] want you to give me the big
[48:10] piece the idea if a brother had you know
[48:14] two of something and I didn't have any
[48:15] would you give me and it's like oh
[48:17] brother you know I've got two of those
[48:20] right as long as you don't have it
[48:21] you're willing to say yeah I you know
[48:22] whatever you want if I had if I had two
[48:24] Teslas I'd give you one
[48:27] right well brother Aaron if you had two
[48:29] Mont blancs I think brother Jim pingston
[48:31] did that on me one time brother brother
[48:32] Aaron if you had two Mont blancs would
[48:34] you would give me one well brother you
[48:35] know I've got two mbls what are you
[48:37] asking for but it touches on the idea of
[48:39] are you genuinely concerned about other
[48:43] people will you prefer
[48:46] them and say well this is they well they
[48:49] they should have given it to me so I
[48:51] just took
[48:52] it but an honor preferring one another
[48:54] you actually prefer someone above
[48:56] yourself
[48:57] in 2 Corinthians 5:15 I need to hurry
[48:59] here says and he that died died for all
[49:03] that they which live should not live
[49:05] should not henceforth live unto
[49:08] themselves but unto him which died for
[49:11] them and rose
[49:13] again come follow me do as I do live as
[49:17] I lived to live for me as he says that
[49:21] we would live unto him to live like him
[49:25] or to live for him
[49:27] is to live
[49:28] selflessly is to deny self because he
[49:31] that which which lives should not live
[49:34] for
[49:35] themselves we should not live for
[49:38] ourselves brother brandham said a person
[49:40] who lives their life for themselves
[49:42] lives a selfish life we must live for
[49:48] others I'll I'll say this because if we
[49:50] need to stop this would make a good
[49:52] stopping point but a humble home is a
[49:54] home that lives for
[49:55] others lives for others within the home
[49:58] a home a home is a family that lives for
[50:00] each other not this Collective notion
[50:03] that if we could just get our act
[50:04] together and and go do some charitable
[50:06] causes externally and optically it'll
[50:09] make us look good because a lot of
[50:10] people do that for pretense uh they
[50:13] they'll make visitations and they'll do
[50:14] things for the show but in the home
[50:16] they're selfish in the home they're
[50:18] abusive in the home they do things that
[50:20] do not promote honesty and and
[50:22] self-service it's all for the wrong
[50:24] reasons a humble home is a family that
[50:26] lives for each other within
[50:29] it do you I I say this and I hope all my
[50:32] children are listening do you know the
[50:34] problems that would be solved within a
[50:36] family with teenagers if they just
[50:39] preferred one
[50:44] another could you imagine it think about
[50:47] it what would it be like if in a
[50:51] family it was always looking out after
[50:55] the other person
[50:56] no you go ahead no you go
[51:01] ahead no you go ahead and they just
[51:05] could all join hands and Michael row
[51:09] your boat a short like it would just be
[51:13] beautiful the idea that in the beginning
[51:16] of the Christian church that they sold
[51:18] what they
[51:20] had what what's at the core is there was
[51:22] this losing this sense of entitlement
[51:26] and this connection to Earthly
[51:27] possessions and Thinking Beyond
[51:29] themselves of how it could benefit the
[51:30] whole and how one could live for the
[51:32] other and so it wasn't that they
[51:34] automatically just shed everything they
[51:36] owned and became destitute and worthless
[51:38] but they began to get lean in the things
[51:41] they didn't need and use that excess for
[51:44] the benefit of
[51:45] others whether it ultimately if you
[51:48] would agree that It ultimately meant
[51:49] they had sold everything and had all
[51:51] things in common or you realize that
[51:53] those that had this much and those that
[51:54] didn't have this much there was an
[51:55] exchange
[51:57] where they all had in common no one was
[51:59] greater and more preferred than the
[52:00] other no one had more opportunities or
[52:02] advantage over the other because of uh
[52:04] ethnicity or because of background or
[52:06] social economic status there was this
[52:08] idea that what's mine is yours and
[52:10] what's yours is mine and we can all work
[52:12] together for the benefit of the whole
[52:13] and for the Improvement en Rich
[52:15] enrichment of individuals and a humble
[52:17] home is a home where it's a giving
[52:19] household a home that gives to one
[52:22] another and because we give
[52:23] instinctively to one another within the
[52:25] home and I'm willing to look after my
[52:27] sibling and I'm wor willing to look
[52:29] after my spouse and I can live
[52:30] unselfishly in my home then I am not
[52:33] going to be the narcissist outside the
[52:37] home you wonder sometimes why is it that
[52:40] the the the family members can't get
[52:42] along but they can get along with
[52:44] everybody else it's because in the home
[52:47] they know they can treat their brother
[52:49] however they want and you know what he
[52:51] still has to sleep in the same house
[52:53] they're going to wake up the next
[52:54] morning and Mom's going to make him talk
[52:56] to me he's going to make me get along
[52:57] with them we're going to have to do
[52:58] puzzles together whatever it is you
[53:00] realize I don't have to be nice to him
[53:03] we're forced to be
[53:06] together but then when I go to school
[53:08] and I go to church if I'm not nice to
[53:11] these people they won't want to be
[53:12] around me so I got to be nice to them
[53:16] it's how it works it's the psychology of
[53:19] it but a person who lives for themselves
[53:22] lives a selfish
[53:24] life in a similar vein Paul says in
[53:26] Romans
[53:28] 14 for none of us liveth to
[53:31] himself in other words none of us ought
[53:34] to live selfishly none of us ought to
[53:36] live solely for ourselves because we are
[53:39] the Lords that's how he concludes this
[53:40] we are the Lords and therefore being the
[53:42] Lords we should live unto
[53:44] him live like him him live for him we
[53:47] cannot live for him we cannot claim to
[53:49] have eternal life and live selfishly one
[53:52] who lives a selfish life lives a life to
[53:55] themselves he says we must must live for
[53:57] each other none of us should live solely
[54:00] for
[54:00] ourselves brother Bram says I know that
[54:03] he holds all the future and whatever
[54:04] mine shall be it's in his hands so each
[54:07] day I want to live not for myself if I
[54:10] live for myself I live a selfish life I
[54:14] want to live for others give what
[54:16] strength I have not to myself and to my
[54:18] own pleasure but for the benefit of
[54:21] others that will build the kingdom of
[54:24] God I remind you of that statement
[54:26] because it touches on such an important
[54:28] principle each day I want to live not
[54:31] for myself I don't want to live
[54:33] selfishly I don't want to use the
[54:35] strength I have for myself or for my own
[54:37] pleasure but I want to use my
[54:39] opportunities I want to use resources I
[54:41] want to use time I want to use love I
[54:43] want to use attention I want to use
[54:45] whatever I have for the benefit of
[54:46] others that will build the kingdom of
[54:51] God I believe I said it in my prayer
[54:53] last Sunday and I'll say it here based
[54:56] upon the
[54:59] statement that we
[55:02] cannot if if we have if we have excess
[55:05] in our
[55:07] lives we cannot erase the debt we have
[55:10] to the world if we've been exchanging
[55:12] things for our soul if we've been
[55:13] engaging in those transactions that
[55:14] mortgage our home or selling off the
[55:17] peace and Tranquility that we ought to
[55:19] have on our homes we
[55:21] cannot erase that debt to the world we
[55:24] cannot uh balance out that's maybe the
[55:27] word I'm looking for we cannot balance
[55:29] The Ledger and make our house a home
[55:31] just simply by subtracting worldly
[55:35] things Jesus did not ask Devas to sell
[55:38] all he had to get lean Pack Light he
[55:43] said give it to the
[55:45] poor we cannot think that we can uh uh
[55:49] in this instance have addition by
[55:51] subtraction alone that if I could just
[55:53] get rid of the wrong things everything
[55:55] will be in balance
[55:56] it's more of a matter of filling your
[55:59] life up with the right
[56:01] things there I'm just I'm just I meant
[56:04] to ask you to do this in the beginning
[56:07] uh just to continue to pray for God's
[56:08] Direction and leadership as we continue
[56:10] in this vein I'm studying some other
[56:12] things and finding inspiration in some
[56:13] other areas but I just feel a burden to
[56:15] stay in this subject on the house of the
[56:17] Lord and there's a certain there's a
[56:20] phrase that I has been coming back to me
[56:21] the last while on there are no empty
[56:24] houses
[56:27] is if you empty it out of the bad things
[56:29] it it creates a vacuum that is soon
[56:31] filled and and so the goal is not just
[56:34] to shed and subtract the goal is not
[56:36] just to try to balance out The Ledger by
[56:38] getting rid of things we must invest in
[56:42] the kingdom of God by living
[56:45] selflessly we must make the right kind
[56:47] of Investments we must we must find that
[56:50] we are doing more not doing less because
[56:53] there is this idea of through legalism
[56:55] and through restri rtion and through
[56:57] abstaining that we're somehow filling
[56:59] our lives up no you're emptying yourself
[57:02] out and it's better to fill up to push
[57:06] out than it is just to try to empty out
[57:08] and fill it up again right just begin to
[57:11] fill yourself up with investments in the
[57:13] kingdom of God serving is greater than
[57:17] subtracting serving is adding as you
[57:20] serve you're not going to find time for
[57:21] selfish Endeavors as you find the right
[57:24] things to do that would benefit others
[57:25] you're not going to find time for
[57:29] self-pleasure I want to live for others
[57:32] so it's not this Catholic idea or a
[57:35] legalistic idea of I'm going to just
[57:37] bind myself and limit myself and
[57:39] restrain myself that's not going that's
[57:42] not going to fulfill the desire you have
[57:44] in your heart that's not going to bring
[57:45] the satisfaction that you want you're
[57:47] going to have to find ways to channel
[57:49] the strength and energy to the right
[57:51] things not just bind ourselves away from
[57:54] the wrong things
[57:58] amen and Jesus says in Luke chapter
[58:02] 12 seek not what you shall eat and what
[58:04] you'll drink and don't be of a doubtful
[58:07] mind trust the Lord trust God for all
[58:09] these things do the nations of the world
[58:11] seek after and your father knoweth that
[58:13] you have need of these things this is in
[58:14] Matthew chapter 6 as well but rather
[58:16] seek ye the kingdom of God and all these
[58:19] things shall be added unto
[58:21] you how is it that we build the kingdom
[58:23] of God living for the benefit of others
[58:27] it's it's not even selfishly wanting to
[58:31] promote and build the kingdom of
[58:33] God it really is amazing just how
[58:36] Christianity has been turned so cultish
[58:39] with Cults of personalities and a and
[58:42] things that are all the ideas of
[58:44] self-preserving and and these Notions of
[58:47] protecting ourselves and protecting
[58:48] truths and protecting ideals and when
[58:50] really it's an idea of living for others
[58:53] I can't get away from it there's so much
[58:55] that could be preached on the idea of
[58:56] living for others and it certainly would
[58:58] be repetitive for some of the themes
[59:00] we've already visited as a church but
[59:02] this is the whole idea behind the
[59:03] scripture I I am seeking first the
[59:06] kingdom of God that's not even
[59:09] self-promotion it's not necessar
[59:11] promoting Christianity but it's being
[59:13] Christ to others who are in
[59:15] need fear not little flock for it's your
[59:17] father's good pleasure to give you the
[59:19] kingdom you don't have to be selfish you
[59:20] don't have to be self-preserving sell
[59:22] that you have and give arms provide
[59:24] yourselves bags which whack not old in
[59:26] other words be giving be generous don't
[59:29] just hoard your wealth don't be scraping
[59:31] and pinching and doing everything you
[59:33] can to preserve yourself he's saying do
[59:35] what you can for the benefit of others
[59:36] live for others serve others serve the
[59:38] kingdom of God sell all you have so we
[59:40] say oh that's what he tells the rich man
[59:42] to do but it's like he tells the
[59:44] disciples to do sell all you have give
[59:46] alms in doing so provide yourselves bags
[59:49] which wax not old in other words put
[59:50] your money in a bag and that you intend
[59:53] to use
[59:57] a treasure in the heavens that faileth
[59:59] not where no thief thief approacheth
[1:00:03] neither moth corruptive for where your
[1:00:06] treasure is there will your heart be
[1:00:09] also what are you generous to
[1:00:12] yourself who are you kind to what are
[1:00:15] you worried about what are you what are
[1:00:16] you protecting what are you serving are
[1:00:18] you is it self-devotion self-promotion
[1:00:20] self-
[1:00:21] protection or can you trust God and not
[1:00:24] be of a doubtful mind be happy with
[1:00:27] whatever things you have or if you have
[1:00:29] if you're rich in certain things just be
[1:00:31] ready to distribute communicate be rich
[1:00:34] in good
[1:00:36] works for where your treasure is there
[1:00:38] will your heart be
[1:00:41] also sell all that you have and give
[1:00:43] alms provide yourself bags which wax not
[1:00:45] old and you will shall have treasure in
[1:00:49] heaven it's exactly what he says to the
[1:00:53] Rich Young Ruler
[1:00:57] that's what he asked us to
[1:01:00] do Jesus said the greatest among you
[1:01:03] shall be your servant brother BR said
[1:01:04] all truly great men of history have been
[1:01:07] servants they who demanded to be served
[1:01:10] they who oppressed they who sought to
[1:01:13] always be at the head have gone down in
[1:01:16] shame even the very rich are condemned
[1:01:19] by God when they have not used their
[1:01:21] wealth
[1:01:22] right but look into history and you'll
[1:01:24] find that the truly great were those
[1:01:26] those who served
[1:01:29] others Jesus in Matthew 6: 16- 21
[1:01:34] again calls out the Hypocrites who when
[1:01:36] they're fasting they make sure everybody
[1:01:38] knows they disfigure their faces they
[1:01:40] appear sad they they want them to know
[1:01:42] that oh I'm
[1:01:44] fasting but he says when you fast don't
[1:01:47] do it for show don't do it for
[1:01:49] pretense that you would not appear and
[1:01:51] Dem men that you were fasting and your
[1:01:53] father which is in secret will reward
[1:01:55] you openly
[1:01:56] it says in verse 19 lay not up for
[1:01:58] yourselves Treasures upon Earth where
[1:02:00] moth and rust doth corrupt and where
[1:02:02] thieves break through and steal but lay
[1:02:05] up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven
[1:02:07] where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt
[1:02:09] where thieves do not break through nor
[1:02:10] steal for where your Treasures there
[1:02:12] will your heart be
[1:02:13] also how do we do that by serving
[1:02:17] others how do we do that by not being
[1:02:20] Hypocrites by not doing it for pretense
[1:02:23] or
[1:02:24] self-promotion by seeking first the
[1:02:26] kingdom of God we sell all we have and
[1:02:28] give alms provide bags which wax not old
[1:02:31] and you shall lay up for yourselves
[1:02:32] Treasures upon Earth this Matthew 6 21
[1:02:35] 19 to 21 matches with Luke 12
[1:02:39] 31-34 and right in the heart of it Luke
[1:02:41] is live beyond yourself live for others
[1:02:45] that's what a humble home would
[1:02:49] do I I think of the the concept and
[1:02:52] notion of an only
[1:02:54] child and I feel that no matter how big
[1:02:56] families are anymore every child is an
[1:02:58] only child it's just the nature of the
[1:03:01] age there there's this idea that whether
[1:03:04] you be the firstborn the middle born or
[1:03:06] the last born that you're the only child
[1:03:07] and everyone else is just interloping on
[1:03:09] your domain and that everything should
[1:03:11] exist to please
[1:03:13] you and we're laughing because we're
[1:03:15] thinking about our kids and I'm talking
[1:03:16] about us
[1:03:18] adults we're talking about Humanity
[1:03:20] we're talking about the way that we
[1:03:22] act I'm trying to close this out just
[1:03:25] have a few more things here appreciate
[1:03:27] your attentiveness brother brand when
[1:03:29] he's preaching the bru serpent that the
[1:03:31] revelation of Jesus Christ series that
[1:03:33] he preached in 61 this is Revelation
[1:03:35] chapter 5 part one he says he's speaking
[1:03:37] of a conversation he had with Dr Sam
[1:03:39] madir and brother Bram says the greatest
[1:03:41] thr I have is living for others and he
[1:03:45] said that's what makes life real is when
[1:03:49] you're not what you can do for or
[1:03:50] accomplish for yourself but what you can
[1:03:53] do for
[1:03:54] others believe brother bamman saying
[1:03:56] this and quoting Dr Sam madir that he's
[1:03:58] saying that this this is true the
[1:04:01] greatest thrill I have is living for
[1:04:03] others that's what brother bradam said
[1:04:04] and then Dr Adair says that's what makes
[1:04:07] life
[1:04:08] real that's what makes it real he said
[1:04:11] that's and brother Bram joins to it says
[1:04:13] that's when you're really living if
[1:04:15] there happens to be someone Among Us
[1:04:17] who's never done that tried to live for
[1:04:19] somebody else give that a try and just
[1:04:22] see how much more life holds for you
[1:04:24] when you will not live for what you can
[1:04:26] get yourself out of life but what you
[1:04:28] can give someone else in
[1:04:30] life now let's all take the
[1:04:34] medicine and in order for there to be a
[1:04:36] humble home it doesn't start with one it
[1:04:39] doesn't start with one person demanding
[1:04:41] that everyone else humble themselves but
[1:04:43] all we have to do is the domino effect
[1:04:44] of saying well I'll humble myself I'll
[1:04:47] humble myself I'll take the
[1:04:50] medicine I will do my best to live for
[1:04:54] others
[1:04:56] and he says watch just how much more
[1:04:58] you're going to get out of
[1:04:59] life I this is applicable from the
[1:05:02] youngest to the oldest in our households
[1:05:04] as individuals whether it's interactions
[1:05:06] at school or on the
[1:05:07] job for us as a family for us as a
[1:05:12] church and if you'll find that it's more
[1:05:14] blessed than riches or anything that can
[1:05:16] be thought of is when you can do for
[1:05:18] someone else to make life's burdens he
[1:05:20] says which life in itself is a burden
[1:05:22] and it'll make it a little lighter for
[1:05:24] someone else when you act in a way just
[1:05:27] to make someone else's burden a little
[1:05:28] bit lighter there's this notion and idea
[1:05:31] sometimes where it's like oh it's their
[1:05:34] burden it's going to take so much to
[1:05:36] relieve them of the burden it's going to
[1:05:38] take so much to fix their problem well
[1:05:40] maybe you don't need to fix their
[1:05:41] problem maybe you just need to make it a
[1:05:42] little bit
[1:05:44] lighter we're not asked to solve all the
[1:05:46] problems you don't have to take the
[1:05:47] whole thing there's a lot of things I
[1:05:49] was uh reading something one time on
[1:05:52] just how broke the Health Care system is
[1:05:55] and everyone
[1:05:56] said and there was and and so there's
[1:05:59] this we look at the problems of the
[1:06:01] Health Care system and and how
[1:06:03] commercialized it's become and all the
[1:06:04] difficulties and problems and we think
[1:06:06] well how are we ever going to turn a a
[1:06:09] billions of dollar industry how are we
[1:06:11] going to change the way this thing has
[1:06:12] gone over the last many decades but you
[1:06:14] know there's some really really small
[1:06:15] changes that could be made that
[1:06:18] incrementally they'll make a
[1:06:20] difference in small little
[1:06:23] pieces and and over time if you just
[1:06:26] Implement certain things and make small
[1:06:27] changes over time you gain momentum and
[1:06:29] it may you may not fix the whole problem
[1:06:32] but it's enough to make a difference for
[1:06:33] a lot of people and sometimes we look at
[1:06:36] a problem whether it be in relationships
[1:06:38] or in a home or some sort of situation
[1:06:40] and like man the whole thing we're never
[1:06:42] going to be able to fix the whole thing
[1:06:43] the whole thing can never be changed it
[1:06:45] can never be overrun or overturned what
[1:06:47] about just small changes that can be
[1:06:49] made starting with yourself what's in
[1:06:50] your power what's in your hand they
[1:06:52] could have never fed the thousands of
[1:06:54] people that gathered on the hillside
[1:06:55] that day if they just said well we can't
[1:06:58] afford this but start with what you have
[1:07:01] Five Loaves and two fish start with that
[1:07:03] let's see how far it gets us there's
[1:07:06] some that suggest that in the telling in
[1:07:08] uh The Book of Mark I believe it is that
[1:07:10] Jesus prays and blesses the fish and
[1:07:13] bread and I believe that the scripture I
[1:07:15] believe it was a supernatural miracle
[1:07:17] that takes place but for whatever reason
[1:07:19] that it's silent in Mark maybe leaves to
[1:07:22] us this thought that if one person is
[1:07:24] willing to give Five Loaves and two fish
[1:07:27] to the
[1:07:29] 5,000 that it could have caused others
[1:07:32] to say well I'll share mine
[1:07:35] too and I'll share mine too and before
[1:07:39] you know it everyone
[1:07:41] shares and there was enough there for
[1:07:46] leftovers because one was willing to
[1:07:48] live for the
[1:07:49] other and someone else took the queue
[1:07:52] and live for
[1:07:53] another I remember when I was in High
[1:07:55] School I think I was a sophomore at the
[1:07:57] time all my friends were seniors so I
[1:07:59] was orphaned after that after they all
[1:08:02] graduated uh they called themselves the
[1:08:04] Duds I wore a San Diego Padre hat and it
[1:08:07] um and it had SD on it and so they
[1:08:09] called me super dud or sophomore dud it
[1:08:13] just depended on whether or not they
[1:08:14] were liking me at the time I guess but I
[1:08:16] didn't have a job I was you know just
[1:08:18] they're all graduating or last there
[1:08:20] last day of school I don't know why I'm
[1:08:21] telling this story last day of school
[1:08:25] and all went to Taco Bell I didn't have
[1:08:27] any money I mean I'm just they I show up
[1:08:30] they're all eating they're all they're
[1:08:32] all they're all from wealthy they really
[1:08:33] weren't Duds I was the dud and and I
[1:08:36] remember I didn't have any money so
[1:08:38] they're like hey just wait at the end of
[1:08:39] the line we'll all give you our
[1:08:41] change and then you could buy something
[1:08:43] so they all went through and in order
[1:08:45] for me to have change you know they only
[1:08:47] got a couple tacos they all got Waters
[1:08:49] and small drinks so then when by the
[1:08:50] time I got all the change I ordered I
[1:08:52] had like a large drink I had several
[1:08:53] tacos I eat better than all of them
[1:08:55] they're like
[1:08:57] what you got a drink we all got water so
[1:09:00] you could eat there was act there was
[1:09:03] leftovers it was a miracle was my point
[1:09:06] but that's what we can have if we all
[1:09:08] give if we all shared if we all had a
[1:09:11] mindset where I'm I'm not just going to
[1:09:12] look out after myself I'm not just going
[1:09:13] to preserve for myself but if I can live
[1:09:16] for somebody else it's much more
[1:09:17] rewarding much more uplifting and we can
[1:09:20] start with ourselves I want to make my
[1:09:22] the burden lighter he says you don't
[1:09:24] know the joy unless you've tried it once
[1:09:26] to do something for someone else not
[1:09:28] necessarily eradicate the whole burden
[1:09:30] but be burdened for them in their
[1:09:32] burden make it just a little bit
[1:09:43] lighter amen God bless you let's just
[1:09:45] stand together
