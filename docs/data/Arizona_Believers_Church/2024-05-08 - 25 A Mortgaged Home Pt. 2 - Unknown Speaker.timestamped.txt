[0:00] amen just feels so good in the house of
[0:02] the Lord tonight as compliment to the
[0:03] song leaders the musicians and all of
[0:05] you just appreciate it I I'm going to
[0:09] start uh right where we were leaving off
[0:11] actually I'll give a little bit of a
[0:12] review from Sunday but we're going to
[0:13] continue on a mortgaged home this is
[0:16] part two I didn't anticipate a part two
[0:18] on this uh and the thought is as we've
[0:22] been talking about my home is not for
[0:23] sale or selling our homes and the house
[0:25] is the structure but then we could
[0:27] somehow forfeit and give up our rights
[0:29] to the home the feeling such as the
[0:31] woman did in the garden uh and that's a
[0:33] parallel to our lives now where we can
[0:35] still have something or some structure
[0:37] or some appearance or some of the the
[0:39] things that would uh give us shelter and
[0:41] give us a sense of belonging but then we
[0:43] could somehow forfeit all that and sell
[0:45] it so that we lose our home and I'm
[0:48] wanting to look at it from a little bit
[0:49] different side to where we may not be
[0:51] able to we may not completely sell the
[0:53] home but we can just mortgage it in
[0:55] other words it's leaned by somebody we
[0:57] owe or we've done something in our
[1:00] transacting to where it's burdened it's
[1:01] a we've given it up as security um to
[1:04] have something in the world so we're
[1:06] building on the concept of a home
[1:07] mortgage and how the in that typical
[1:10] transaction you're offering up your
[1:11] house as a security uh for a loan so
[1:14] there's a debt owed and that's how most
[1:16] of us are able to afford a home I was
[1:19] looking at just the debt statistics here
[1:21] recently and still a mortgage is the
[1:24] greatest debt that most people carry and
[1:26] we realize that there's uh hopefully
[1:28] some equity in that or there's some
[1:30] um some worth in the thing that is
[1:31] mortgaged or secured but it's still the
[1:34] concept of getting having something
[1:36] leaned and in that transaction but kind
[1:38] of looking at it in terms of spiritually
[1:39] what types of transactions are we
[1:41] entering into as Believers um or in that
[1:44] we mortgaging our home life where we owe
[1:47] the bank we owe the world we owe Satan
[1:49] we owe somebody else something and we've
[1:51] had to give up the security of our home
[1:53] or our home as a security in order to
[1:55] secure what the world wanted to give us
[1:58] uh brother bam writes this and referring
[2:00] to the Le Dean age and this answer of
[2:02] God come by of me um gold tried in the
[2:06] fire and and white rment you'll be
[2:08] clothed in eyes Saab so you can see he
[2:10] says come to me and buy it is evident
[2:12] from this phrase bu of me that the Le
[2:15] Dean church is not at all dealing with
[2:17] Jesus for the spiritual products of the
[2:19] kingdom of God their transactions cannot
[2:22] be spiritual they may think they are
[2:24] spiritual but how can they be now in
[2:27] terms of transactions being spiritual we
[2:29] know that there a a church context
[2:31] there's a church World context there's
[2:33] maybe a religious context to this and
[2:35] I'm not just trying to blow past that or
[2:37] I'm certainly not trying to change the
[2:38] meaning where brother B saying that they
[2:40] build schools and they're missionaries
[2:42] and they have churches and they do a lot
[2:43] of religious things and a lot of great
[2:44] works but yet their hearts are far from
[2:46] them they're not going to Christ and
[2:49] exchanging uh as he says their spiritual
[2:51] products are not dealing with Jesus
[2:53] Christ and if if that's a concept in a
[2:56] religious way I'm wanting just to borrow
[2:58] that same principle and say what about
[3:00] just in daily life and living and and
[3:02] interacting with the world and these
[3:03] other things that aren't so much the
[3:05] religious side but in the living side of
[3:07] things and the practicality how are our
[3:09] transactions not spiritual and a
[3:12] transaction is a negotiated agreement uh
[3:15] it's the management of an affair or it
[3:16] could be a settlement of an affair and
[3:18] kind of in that word to trans to cross
[3:20] something or to go beyond or through a
[3:23] and a gear which is that to set into
[3:24] motion to drive forward so when there's
[3:27] a transaction you accomplish something
[3:29] or you perform or drive or carry through
[3:33] uh you come to a settlement so when he
[3:35] says that their transactions cannot be
[3:37] spiritual their drive is not spiritual
[3:40] their accomplishments aren't spiritual
[3:42] their settlements are not spiritual so
[3:44] their motivation at the end of the day
[3:45] what they're trying to accomplish is not
[3:48] spiritual I think that's a real real key
[3:50] that if their transactions are not
[3:52] spiritual uh what they're settling on
[3:54] what they're agreeing to what they're
[3:55] accomplishing what their Drive is is not
[3:57] spiritual and we could say that
[3:59] character is not valued at the end of
[4:01] the day that they're not looking for
[4:02] character they're not looking for uh
[4:04] those things of character and honesty
[4:06] and integrity or Holiness that those are
[4:08] not the things that are pursued because
[4:10] their transactions not being spiritual
[4:12] they're not pursuing the real spiritual
[4:14] things the things that ought to be
[4:16] valued but they pursue gain riches
[4:19] consumption and when we speak of riches
[4:21] it speaks of wealth or gain might be a
[4:23] word just to accumulate it all together
[4:25] but it's not just merely money but it's
[4:27] whatever a capital or whatever assets or
[4:30] whatever bartering or exchange uh
[4:32] whether you're using uh Karma or clout
[4:34] or whatever it is you're trying to use
[4:36] to gain things from the world it's just
[4:37] those transactions that are trying to
[4:39] bring you
[4:40] gain and let's just say this that if you
[4:43] are dealing with Jesus Christ uh for
[4:46] these products of the kingdom of God
[4:48] those spiritual transactions will never
[4:50] mortgage your home life they'll only
[4:52] enhance it they'll only strengthen it
[4:54] the Bible says in Proverbs 23:23 buy the
[4:57] truth and sell it not so for pursuing
[5:00] anything this is the remedy to the L
[5:02] Deen condition buy of me gold tried in
[5:05] the fire buy of me rment that you might
[5:07] be clothed By Me isav In order to see
[5:09] all those things are found in Christ so
[5:12] if you come to Christ for your spiritual
[5:14] dealings if you come to Christ for the
[5:15] products of the kingdom of God then in
[5:17] doing those transactions it won't be a
[5:20] detriment to your personal life it won't
[5:22] be a detriment to your family life it
[5:23] won't be a detriment to your
[5:24] professional life even if you lose your
[5:27] job even if you don't get a promotion
[5:29] because God's going to be watching out
[5:31] over that and looking out after that to
[5:33] get to take care of you when you stand
[5:35] for the kingdom of God when these things
[5:37] are being added to you in a spiritual
[5:39] way it puts you in the best position to
[5:41] succeed because I'm going to buy the
[5:42] truth and sell it not and this is by
[5:44] wisdom instruction and understanding
[5:47] these are all materials to build up the
[5:49] home life materials to build up the home
[5:50] materials to build your testimony so
[5:53] that you leave the right kind of Legacy
[5:55] and the things that Christ says to come
[5:57] and by Revelation the Holiness the
[5:59] character
[6:00] they're all worth investing in right
[6:03] they're all worth investing in and and I
[6:06] I think of it now it's speaking about
[6:08] Revelation and again I just acknowledge
[6:10] that you all remember this better than
[6:11] me but in 2021 we ministered on
[6:13] Revelation re Revol resolves whatever it
[6:17] was then resolves
[6:19] complication and and Revelation is
[6:21] what's going to resolve all the
[6:22] complications we see in this world now
[6:24] it's not maybe solve the complication
[6:26] but it resolves it for us we can see the
[6:28] complexities we can understand that
[6:30] God's working for our good and so I've
[6:32] touched a lot on this before and I'd
[6:34] venture to say that most of us weren't
[6:36] here when we did it uh but so it's worth
[6:38] and it but yet it's still worth
[6:39] repeating I know sometimes we can be
[6:41] critical of ministers ah they already
[6:43] preached that before oh they already
[6:44] preached that before well brother
[6:45] brandham preached some sermons a dozen
[6:47] times and oftentimes just repeating in
[6:49] the same way now I'm not claiming to be
[6:51] like brother brandham but just be
[6:52] careful with your criticisms because you
[6:55] might you might be creating a template
[6:56] that condemns you or condemns somebody
[6:58] else you don't mean to and if I'm
[7:00] getting old and seen Nile and I just
[7:01] keep repeating myself over and over
[7:03] again that would be one problem but
[7:04] repeating the word as it is necessary I
[7:08] I don't think there's a problem with
[7:10] that so we want to uh we want to buy the
[7:13] truth sell it not wisdom instruction and
[7:15] understanding these are things that we
[7:16] must transact in and these spiritual
[7:19] transactions are sure Investments you're
[7:22] going to get the right kind of return on
[7:24] this there there's no there should be no
[7:26] fear that you're it's going to end out
[7:28] as a negative for you when you invest in
[7:30] these things CU these spiritual
[7:32] transactions are not detriments they're
[7:34] not predition they're not destruction
[7:36] but they're they're they're establishing
[7:38] and strengthening and supporting to
[7:40] invest in these things in 1 Timothy
[7:42] chapter 6 we'll read to verse uh verse 6
[7:45] to 10 and I I could be pulled right into
[7:48] this to try to break it down like we did
[7:50] last time but I want to reset it to go
[7:53] forward I'm I'm trying to finish
[7:54] Sunday's service first so that um if we
[7:57] can't finish tonight's we can just move
[7:59] it to but godliness with contentment is
[8:01] great gain not just worldly gain not
[8:03] just appearing to be successful because
[8:06] as he's saying these evil sisers uh
[8:09] because they were wealthy or because
[8:10] they Rich because they had big
[8:11] congregations they had a following or
[8:13] they appeared to have things put
[8:14] together they kind of trusted in the
[8:17] appearance of things as being godliness
[8:19] but he's saying no godliness with
[8:21] contentment is actually the gain you
[8:23] don't you can't back into that I'm rich
[8:25] so it must be godliness but rather
[8:27] godliness with contentment is great gain
[8:30] for we brought nothing into this world
[8:31] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[8:33] out and having food and rment let us
[8:35] therewith be content what a a simple
[8:38] summary of what we ought to be content
[8:40] with as we emphasized on Sunday having
[8:42] the Necessities having what you need to
[8:44] be who God's called you to be in your
[8:46] calling we should be content with that
[8:48] and not be restless to move beyond that
[8:50] but they that will be rich who long and
[8:52] desire and covet after the gain of the
[8:54] world fall into temptation and a snare
[8:56] and in many foolish and hurtful lust
[8:59] which drown men in destruction and
[9:01] predition so the the to be greedy for
[9:04] gain to lust after the things of the
[9:06] world to always be interested and
[9:07] procuring or consuming is a snare or a
[9:10] trap that if we fall into it causes
[9:13] hurtful uh um hurtful lust and many
[9:16] foolish lust that drown Us in
[9:17] destruction so this is something that we
[9:19] all should be on guard for is how the
[9:21] world tries to tempt us and get us into
[9:24] these types of transactions so it says
[9:26] For the Love of Money is the root of all
[9:29] evil
[9:29] it's a large phrase that could we could
[9:32] spend a lot of time on and I know
[9:33] there's still maybe greater depths that
[9:35] we could all understand this in and we
[9:37] we pray for that we ask for God to give
[9:38] us revelation we want to understand the
[9:40] word in a better way but we can catch it
[9:42] enough tonight to say the love of money
[9:44] is the root of all evil not just money
[9:47] but it's that inordinate affection
[9:48] towards it the
[9:50] unreasonable emphasis on it the Reliance
[9:53] the trust in it is the root of all evil
[9:55] which are some coveted after now I I
[9:58] want to come to this later in that this
[10:00] is kind of the nature of this gain the
[10:02] nature of riches and wealth that when
[10:04] you have it or when you begin to covet
[10:06] after it it has a pull it has an
[10:09] influence and and it causes you it says
[10:11] to air from the faith and Pierce
[10:13] yourselves through with many Sorrows so
[10:15] we ought not to Value the gain of this
[10:18] world but rather godliness should be
[10:19] valued godlikeness to be in the
[10:21] character of Christ those are the things
[10:23] that we ought to treasure things we
[10:24] ought to pursue uh Christ is the most
[10:27] important thing he is the most important
[10:29] this word is the most important but then
[10:31] on the other side you have the flesh
[10:33] that's pulled to have and to enjoy and
[10:34] to experience and to use the resources
[10:37] we have to enjoy great things and maybe
[10:39] it is to kind of keep up with other
[10:41] people because they go on vacations and
[10:42] they do this and they do that and they
[10:44] have this and they have that and we feel
[10:46] like we're missing out so there's a lot
[10:47] of uh heris in our lives a lot of things
[10:49] that take place in our hearts where
[10:51] we're comparing and we're pulled and
[10:53] we're jealous and we want to experience
[10:55] and let's just acknowledge we live in a
[10:56] world where we're constantly being
[10:57] bombarded with information from friends
[11:00] from Family from social media from the
[11:02] news internet all sorts of Publications
[11:04] that try to pray on our desire to have
[11:07] to enjoy and to be accepted and to
[11:10] belong and experience things and so it
[11:12] pulls on this other side of us where we
[11:14] can be have foolish lust and we can uh
[11:17] not be content with the things that we
[11:19] have and and Pierce ourselves through
[11:21] with many Sorrows so the proverb writes
[11:24] the writer says in Proverbs 15 ver 27 he
[11:27] that is greedy of gain this overe
[11:30] eagerness to be rich this extreme desire
[11:33] for wealth and and material gain
[11:35] troubles his own house so this to me is
[11:39] just perfect language for what we're
[11:41] trying to talk about in the house of the
[11:42] Lord and ourselves being uh identified
[11:45] in that our families and even our church
[11:46] that if you're greedy for gain I mean
[11:49] even as a church if we just want to we
[11:50] want to grow our numbers and we want to
[11:52] get bigger and we want to have better
[11:54] and we want to do this well that that
[11:55] troubles the church because because if
[11:58] we're if we're growing if we're
[12:00] increasing in numbers the wrong way I
[12:02] would say we're swelling not growing
[12:05] amen it's like a dead carcass just
[12:08] bloating right and I don't I wouldn't
[12:10] want to grow that way as a church and
[12:12] say oh my we're bursting at the seams
[12:13] like a dead corpse just bloating just
[12:16] rotting in this Phoenix heat and so it's
[12:18] not we're not just looking for gain and
[12:21] have better this and better that you
[12:22] look at the spiritual needs and I
[12:24] promise you I believe in all with all my
[12:26] heart that if we put Christ first as
[12:28] individual and in our families and we
[12:30] feel that we're together as a church
[12:31] here and we not just focus on church and
[12:34] getting ahead and building a building
[12:35] and all these different things but just
[12:37] put first Christ and all the other
[12:38] things that we should whether it be our
[12:40] giving and whether it be our attendance
[12:42] and all those things that this will take
[12:44] care of
[12:45] itself it God will provide and he won't
[12:48] give us more than we need and he
[12:49] certainly wouldn't hold back those
[12:51] things that are necessary from us so we
[12:53] can just find that pocket and stay in it
[12:54] and know that God will bless
[12:56] us but if we get pulled out it troubles
[12:58] our house when we're greedy for gain but
[13:01] he that hateth gift shall live and all
[13:02] the mothers
[13:04] said don't take it
[13:06] leral that gifts is a bribe he that
[13:10] hates gifts shall live in other words
[13:11] he'll Prosper he'll do well he'll
[13:13] succeed because he will not let worldly
[13:16] gain compromise his discernment he will
[13:19] not engage in a transaction that is
[13:21] meant to cause him to turn his eye or me
[13:23] him to compromise these gifts are bribes
[13:26] that are paid in order to change a
[13:28] person's Jud judgement so greed makes us
[13:31] vulnerable to wrong decisions makes us
[13:33] vulnerable to enticements to traps to oh
[13:36] man all I got to do is just cheat a
[13:38] little bit as a contractor just cheat a
[13:40] little bit I can make a little bit more
[13:42] money and it will make decisions we
[13:44] otherwise would never make but when we
[13:47] get in a position where we feel like we
[13:49] need more money I need this to make it
[13:50] work we start
[13:52] cheating I'm trying to remember uh
[13:55] well I think my brother Manuel it might
[13:57] have been you that said it that when we
[13:58] don't pay our ties because we're in a
[14:00] financial pickle says you're putting
[14:02] more faith in that 10% than you are in
[14:06] God who can take care of the
[14:08] situation if you didn't pay your ties uh
[14:10] uh uh because you had bills to pay or
[14:13] your debt was really really difficult no
[14:14] matter what that amount is you're saying
[14:17] that your tithe holding that back was
[14:19] greater than trusting God to take care
[14:21] of your financial
[14:22] problem just put that on repeat that was
[14:24] powerful you said that right yeah he
[14:26] needs all the credit we'll pay loyalties
[14:29] on
[14:31] that and and so there's
[14:34] a uh that when we make those kind of
[14:37] transactions are are we're not making
[14:39] the right kind of spiritual decisions so
[14:41] it says he that hateth gifts shall
[14:43] live there's it's a it's a mindset that
[14:46] is going to be aware and conscious of
[14:48] transactions we make that exhibit a
[14:51] trust in worldly things and not in God I
[14:55] can't remember where I C came across the
[14:57] saying but it's in response to to these
[14:59] scriptures I'm using it's not the man
[15:01] who has too little but the man who
[15:03] craves more that is
[15:06] poor it's not the man that has too
[15:08] little but the man who craves more that
[15:10] is poor and when you look at it that way
[15:13] there's a lot of rich people who are the
[15:15] poorest people on Earth it's not us if
[15:17] we have little that doesn't that's not
[15:19] what makes us poor but it's wanting more
[15:21] than we have and being dissatisfied what
[15:23] we with what we have That's What Makes a
[15:25] Man Poor we referred to the siren song
[15:28] of the world the Temptation a siren song
[15:30] is a call an urement from the world or
[15:32] really maybe in any situation it's used
[15:35] um in the sense that a siren song is a
[15:37] Temptation that's difficult to resist
[15:39] and it leads to harm it's detrimental
[15:41] use the example of Odysseus who's had to
[15:44] tie himself to the Mast of a ship and
[15:46] his rowers put his soldiers put wax in
[15:48] their ears and covered their ears lest
[15:50] they be tempted by the song of the
[15:52] sirens and how orus played his harp
[15:56] louder than the singing it was a way to
[15:58] drown out the siren song and the world
[16:01] is constantly singing to us a siren song
[16:04] that's trying to provoke the love of
[16:06] money to be greedy for gain the Allure
[16:08] of riches to have to possess to
[16:11] experience and I'm not sure if we used
[16:13] this oh yes we did we used it I think we
[16:15] pretty much closed on this so it's taken
[16:17] me a good 20 minutes just to get to
[16:19] where we want to be tonight Proverbs
[16:21] 11:28 and 29 he that trusteth in his
[16:24] riches shall
[16:25] fall when Paul is talking about they
[16:27] that be rich he's saying charge the them
[16:29] a certain way that they have a certain
[16:30] mindset because he doesn't want them to
[16:32] trust in their richest because the Bible
[16:34] teaches us that he who trusts and has
[16:36] confidence in and feels secure by his
[16:38] riches he shall fall but the righteous
[16:41] shall flourish as a branch it's amazing
[16:44] how it doesn't seem well to to trust in
[16:48] W riches is a characteristic of a wicked
[16:50] person right because notice it doesn't
[16:52] say he that trusteth in riches shall
[16:54] fall but the poor who don't will
[16:57] flourish or he that doesn't trust in
[16:59] riches will flourish he's just saying
[17:01] the one that trust in riches he's going
[17:03] to fall but the righteous the righteous
[17:06] should not trust in W riches because
[17:08] that's what the wicked
[17:12] do the wicked witches of
[17:15] riches almost fell into a lisp there so
[17:18] I just have to get it out or it'll come
[17:20] back the righteous shall flourish as a
[17:23] branch he that troubleth his own house
[17:25] because he that troubles his own house
[17:26] is the one that's greedy for gain who
[17:27] trust in riches shall inherit the wind
[17:30] and the fool shall be servant to the
[17:32] wise of heart that's
[17:35] simple uh this the the
[17:39] fool the the the those that lack
[17:41] Discerning discernment saying then the
[17:43] one that trusts in riches the one who's
[17:45] greedy for gain he's going to get what's
[17:47] coming to him but then it says the wise
[17:50] of heart that it's usually the fool who
[17:52] becomes servant to the
[17:54] wise he that trusteth in riches trust
[17:57] him for What happiness trust in for
[17:59] security for their portion for your
[18:01] possession when we trust in gain and
[18:04] riches and wealth he says that troubles
[18:05] our house that causes us to
[18:09] fall now I hope that we're kind of at a
[18:12] spot where the things I'm about to share
[18:14] will make some sense because we were
[18:15] skipping we skipped a lot of this and it
[18:18] may I hope that it it makes sense in
[18:21] this
[18:22] context Paul is cautioning against greed
[18:24] the Proverbs are cautioning against
[18:26] greed and greed causes us to overvalue
[18:30] things it'll cause us to overvalue Goods
[18:33] or possessions it'll cause us to
[18:34] overvalue Recreation it'll cause us to
[18:36] over value things that we enjoy and
[18:39] though I don't know that I'll touch on
[18:41] this very much but when you overvalue
[18:43] something or you place greater emphasis
[18:44] on it or you get in a spot where you
[18:47] feel like you have to have it it also
[18:49] begins to corrupt to where it leads to
[18:51] shortcuts leads to dishonesty uh we want
[18:54] to get rich quickly because we need to
[18:56] get rich to get the things we want so
[18:58] not willing to be patient and work hard
[18:59] and do it honestly and build yourself to
[19:02] a place where you can enjoy certain
[19:04] things we're always looking for
[19:05] shortcuts and so greed causes us to
[19:08] overvalue to overp pursue and then it
[19:10] can corrupt our character that's the
[19:12] premise but God wants us to have the
[19:15] wisdom of
[19:16] self-control that in our lives it's not
[19:19] that oh man I really want this and I
[19:20] really want that that's not like oh man
[19:22] you must be an evil person but just to
[19:24] recognize man that would be nice but I I
[19:27] I I need this wisdom of self-control
[19:28] control I need the moderation of
[19:31] behavior and this applies in every
[19:33] single instance but I believe the
[19:34] scripture is trying to teach us to not
[19:36] necessarily in every situation have to
[19:39] bind ourselves to the Mast of a ship but
[19:41] to have moderation and behavior on a
[19:43] much higher level and I know that we
[19:45] alluded to this on Sunday because we we
[19:47] mentioned how that it's not just um
[19:50] behavioral self-control in the active
[19:53] sense of restraint in the
[19:55] moment where tonight when we get home
[19:57] from church there's like these cinnamon
[19:59] rolls that are sitting there for our
[20:00] guests that are coming over on Friday
[20:02] and we're like well there's no way we're
[20:03] eating all of those and we can always
[20:05] reposition them on a platter so that
[20:06] once we've eaten one or two it doesn't
[20:08] look like we've already dug into the
[20:09] dessert and you're rationalizing and
[20:11] trying to figure it out and you're and
[20:13] you're so pulled to it that you got to
[20:15] come up with some way I'm going to drink
[20:16] a gallon of water I'm just going to what
[20:18] try to stop yourself it's not that kind
[20:20] of restraint in the
[20:23] moment like adicus or orus where you got
[20:26] to TI me up you got to play music louder
[20:28] I don't want to be
[20:29] tempted not just a moderating a
[20:32] restraining behavior and restraining
[20:33] thoughts and emotions in the moment
[20:35] though we must have that at times in an
[20:38] hour of Temptation in a difficult
[20:40] situation we want something some alarm
[20:42] to go off and to wake us up say man how
[20:44] did I get here how is this happening so
[20:45] it's not just moderating behavior in the
[20:47] moment of temptation but a manner of
[20:49] living that limits being
[20:53] tempted having wives that don't bake so
[20:56] good right no it's a matter of living to
[20:59] where you're not being tempted by
[21:02] it that's a manner of life it's the way
[21:04] of the tree of life not the way of the
[21:06] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the
[21:07] way of tree of knowledge of Good and
[21:08] Evil you better have your uh um your
[21:11] resistance really robust you might your
[21:13] your control mechanisms in the moment
[21:15] those methods of restraint this high
[21:17] level some people operate in a way where
[21:19] they can restrain in those moments but I
[21:21] believe it's a more mature restraint in
[21:22] a more mature manner of living after the
[21:24] tree of life not from the Tree of
[21:26] knowledge of good evil to limit being
[21:28] tempted or distracted from our
[21:30] purpose there a real a critical
[21:33] important thought for me personally to
[21:35] share with you as your pastor is that I
[21:38] I I applaud and I think it's wonderful
[21:41] when we have mechanisms to help us in
[21:42] the moment but there is a manner of
[21:44] living that can keep evil far far
[21:46] further from us there can be areas of
[21:48] Our Lives where Satan has a punch he's
[21:50] always just real close can be um certain
[21:52] jobs we have or certain things that we
[21:54] do where we're going to have to be on
[21:55] guard and people we have to interact
[21:56] with I recognize that so it's not it's
[21:59] not that you're immature because you're
[22:01] tempted or there's something wrong with
[22:02] your spiritual walk with God because you
[22:04] are having to use active restraint but
[22:06] can we clean up our lives and our
[22:08] transactions to where we're limiting
[22:10] those interactions to where you're in
[22:12] the place where God is standing with you
[22:14] and can fight those
[22:16] battles so the greed will pull us into
[22:19] this uh this difficult ous situation
[22:22] where we're exerting self-will and
[22:24] self-control to resist things and listen
[22:26] if it's just you that runs out
[22:27] eventually and you eat eat the sweet
[22:28] rolls like all of
[22:31] them in Proverbs 13:11 wealth gotten by
[22:34] Vanity shall be diminished but he that
[22:37] GTH by labor shall increase speaks to
[22:40] the mindset of that when you're greedy
[22:42] you take shortcuts you're dishonest
[22:44] wealth that's gained hastily dwindles
[22:46] it's kind of like weight that's lost
[22:48] quickly is quickly found lost 15 pounds
[22:52] in two days gain 30 and four right it's
[22:54] just the way that it works wealth gotten
[22:56] by Vanity shall be diminished
[22:59] but he that gathereth by labor shall
[23:00] increase Gathering little by little
[23:03] increases it that you have a greater
[23:05] appreciation for it when we work hard
[23:07] for it and if there's something wrong
[23:08] and if there's a part that's really
[23:10] dangerous in the day and age we're
[23:11] living in is there's so many things
[23:13] sometimes that we can do to immediately
[23:14] make a lot of money you're like man I
[23:16] did this and I made X number of dollars
[23:18] and exponentially more and you think man
[23:20] that was easy and in your mind you're
[23:22] thinking I am going to be so rich I'm
[23:26] going to be so rich and the reality is
[23:29] to sustain
[23:32] that do you realize what it takes to
[23:34] really get rich doing YouTube videos
[23:36] does anybody know please tell
[23:38] us we're we're at a spot where we can
[23:40] monetize our YouTube channel and I'm
[23:42] thinking I don't know what 53 cents a
[23:43] month is going to get
[23:45] us if it's even that at our levels but
[23:49] hit that subscribe button turn on
[23:52] notifications and we'll build we'll
[23:54] build a new church
[23:55] eventually but it's a it's a mindset
[23:58] towards wealth to where I just I want
[23:59] the wealth I don't want the
[24:01] character I don't want to exhibit
[24:03] integrity and do hard work I I'm not
[24:06] even so much interested in the
[24:08] product where I'm wanting to fulfill a
[24:10] purpose and and I have a vision and I I
[24:12] want to do something that speaks well of
[24:14] my testimony I just want a paycheck at
[24:16] the end of the day that's all I'm after
[24:17] I just want a paycheck that kind of
[24:19] attitude just means you're going to get
[24:20] and you're going to give to the world
[24:22] you're just going to spend it you're
[24:23] going to use it it's going to get go
[24:25] away so the Bible says in Proverbs 234
[24:28] labor not to be
[24:29] rich cease from thine own wisdom with
[24:33] all due respect to Brother David Ramsey
[24:34] we realize that uh your income is your
[24:37] single greatest asset to Building Wealth
[24:39] and so he would say labor and work and
[24:41] get an income to build wealth but I
[24:43] would say labor not to be
[24:46] rich yeah we could recognize there's
[24:48] certain Prudence that we could have in
[24:50] financial matters and towards uh and
[24:52] towards financial habits and practices
[24:54] but really we're not just Rich working
[24:56] to get rich that's why I kind of
[24:58] instinctively reject some Notions about
[25:00] how there's a rich mentality and there's
[25:02] a poor mentality no offense to those
[25:04] that want to read Rich Dad Poor Dad but
[25:06] there's a certain way where that's just
[25:08] in an arena where that's what you want
[25:09] to be as rich and integrity and
[25:12] character and quality of life may not
[25:14] necessarily weigh in on that so it says
[25:16] labor not to be rich cease from thine
[25:18] own wisdom and sure enough some of you
[25:21] probably have autographed copies of that
[25:22] book and we're going to have to talk
[25:24] later and I'm going to say look you know
[25:25] what I got no problem what is it
[25:29] ashimoto or Quasimoto what's his name
[25:31] kobashi I can't
[25:33] remember I've never read it and I've
[25:36] kind of cautioned Elliot against doing
[25:37] it he wants to read it so I'm just
[25:40] dragging our Dirty Laundry to the pulpit
[25:42] I'm dealing with my 16-year-old son in
[25:47] public his uncle is the one that
[25:49] recommended the book did he buy it for
[25:51] you is that what happened it's not even
[25:52] a big deal it's just I'm remembering all
[25:54] this while I'm talking labor not to be
[25:56] rich
[25:58] and he says cease from thine own wisdom
[26:01] let's not exhaust ourselves scheming
[26:03] ways to get
[26:04] money there's things we put so much time
[26:07] and effort in oh man if I could just get
[26:09] rich if I could just close this deal if
[26:10] I could just get this job if I could
[26:12] just get this off the ground I'm GNA be
[26:13] able make a lot of money I'll be able to
[26:14] stay at home more I'll be able to build
[26:15] a church I'll be able to do this I'll be
[26:17] able to do that it's kind of like why
[26:18] don't you just focus on what matters we
[26:21] scheme and put so much time into getting
[26:22] money inventing new things uh forming
[26:25] new projects examining new angles all to
[26:27] try to get ahead and make money and the
[26:29] Bible saying cease from your own wisdom
[26:31] flee from the worldly wisdom that
[26:33] encourages us to use all possible means
[26:35] to get
[26:36] rich right we're all get get rich or die
[26:39] trying
[26:42] mentalities we should treat we shouldn't
[26:46] just Treach Treach treat wealth and gain
[26:49] as
[26:50] blessings when in reality many times
[26:53] they're
[26:54] curses we should not treat riches and
[26:57] wealth as the Apex of wisdom that when
[27:00] you see somebody that has money go oh he
[27:02] must be prudent in his Affairs he must
[27:04] be sharp he must be smart he must be
[27:06] blessed that's not the metric brother
[27:08] Braham teaches us that most of God's
[27:10] children are
[27:14] poor cease from thine own wisdom so if
[27:17] we have God's wisdom we're less likely
[27:19] to be pulled away by the siren song of
[27:23] opportunity sometimes it's just the
[27:24] siren song of novelty cuz some we want
[27:27] new things and we want experience
[27:28] different things and we don't we get
[27:30] dissatisfied where we are because we're
[27:31] just in this upgrade cycle of life where
[27:34] we don't want to just stay doing the
[27:35] same
[27:37] thing and if we get caught in that
[27:40] mindset and
[27:41] behavior
[27:43] the American Psychiatric
[27:46] association to quote them said money
[27:49] continues to be the leading cause of
[27:50] stress for
[27:51] Americans leading cause of
[27:54] stress yielding to the spirit of this
[27:57] age produces the habits of this age
[28:00] giving into it leaning into it and
[28:03] giving into the the yielding to the
[28:05] spirit of this age produces the habits
[28:06] of this age and increases the pressures
[28:08] of this
[28:09] age as brother brandham said the burden
[28:12] of this age is that Lust For riches and
[28:16] uh soft living and nervous
[28:20] tensions it was our former
[28:24] president you're all nervous Theodore
[28:26] Roosevelt who said the things that will
[28:28] destroy America are Prosperity at any
[28:31] price peace at any price Safety First
[28:34] instead of Duty first the love of soft
[28:37] living and the get-rich theory of Life
[28:39] get-rich quick theory of Life brother
[28:41] Teddy nailed
[28:43] it things that will destroy America
[28:46] Prosperity any price peace at any price
[28:49] Safety First instead of Duty first and
[28:51] the love of soft living and the getrich
[28:54] quick theory of life these are the
[28:57] things that are eroding our base and our
[28:59] structure these are the things that we
[29:00] pursue after and we have as platitudes
[29:03] Prosperity at any price peace at any
[29:05] price Safety First instead of Duty first
[29:07] the love of soft living and relaxation
[29:09] and and Leisure and to get rich quick
[29:11] theory of life these are all things that
[29:13] are eroding our love for character our
[29:15] pursuit of Holiness and our calling on
[29:17] God for Revelation more than anything
[29:21] what we call upon God for is not
[29:22] Revelation but a promotion we call upon
[29:25] God for a raise we call upon God oh let
[29:27] me win the lot at least this time
[29:31] please and as we've mentioned before
[29:34] this
[29:35] age this is the age of content
[29:38] consumption it's greed is what the Bible
[29:40] calls it the love of money is
[29:45] destructive I say this just to allude to
[29:47] it I don't need to bring in stats and
[29:49] statistics to prove it but a great
[29:51] burden for Christians money problems
[29:54] Financial pressure and difficulty these
[29:55] are great burdens within to on
[29:57] individual
[29:58] in marriages on family debt and even
[30:01] money management are great curses on
[30:03] individuals and on families these are
[30:06] things that we are very real things and
[30:09] we can feel somewhat alienated sometimes
[30:10] if we just kind of look at it optically
[30:12] and everyone looks like they have it put
[30:14] together but we know our bank accounts
[30:16] and and we know what our uh eat living
[30:18] hand to mouth in our certain situations
[30:20] so we feel kind of backwards everyone
[30:22] can go out to lunch on Sundays we've got
[30:23] to go home because of our financial
[30:25] situation and you may feel backwards
[30:27] because of but listen everyone here
[30:29] knows the pressure of debt Financial
[30:34] struggles and
[30:35] money and and and those of you who and
[30:38] and when we we have to be careful that
[30:40] in trying to keep up we we start to put
[30:43] ourselves in Greater pressure because we
[30:45] don't want to appear to be the
[30:46] non-social or the outcast things that we
[30:49] can just be sensitive to as a
[30:51] congregation ways that we could make
[30:54] others feel uncomfortable
[30:58] I mean that's something to think about
[30:59] right in Ecclesiastes 5: 10-14 I want to
[31:03] read through this rather quickly and and
[31:05] hope that we can come back to it uh in
[31:08] the next half hour or so
[31:11] because it just it just to me it just
[31:13] reads in a way where we can get what
[31:15] he's writing what he's saying he that
[31:16] loveth silver shall not be satisfied
[31:18] with silver great right I love to
[31:22] fish you I can't fish enough right I
[31:26] mean if you love to do something you're
[31:27] not satisfied because you've done
[31:30] it does that make sense that when you
[31:33] really like to do something oh man I
[31:34] just love to fish I love to fish I love
[31:36] to fish I just want to go fishing so
[31:37] like man let's just get brother Aaron a
[31:39] fishing trip and then I go and I'm like
[31:41] I've done it I want to do it again this
[31:43] is awesome this is amazing you've got to
[31:46] do it you've got to try it right it's
[31:47] not like oh I love fishing so much I did
[31:49] it once I'm
[31:51] done done I love it so much so if you
[31:54] love silver you're not satisfied with
[31:56] silver nor he that loveth abundance with
[31:58] increase that's a challenge to the
[32:00] mindset this is also vanity because the
[32:02] one that loves silver can never have
[32:04] enough silver the one who loves
[32:06] abundance is never satisfied with
[32:08] increase because if he gets increased
[32:10] and he loves then he's like I need more
[32:12] like why because I love increase not
[32:14] what I have I love having more than I
[32:15] have and then once I have it I got to
[32:17] have more it's vanity when Goods
[32:19] increase they are increased that eat
[32:21] them and all the families that are
[32:22] growing said
[32:24] amen in other words as you increase the
[32:26] consumption of it increases and what is
[32:28] there the to the owners thereof saving
[32:29] beholding of them with their eyes right
[32:32] you get more and it's consumed the sleep
[32:35] of a laboring man is sweet whether he
[32:39] eat little or much notice the how it
[32:42] kind of gets into the
[32:44] mindset the the the sleep of a laboring
[32:47] man he that gathereth by labor shall
[32:48] increase wealth gotten by Vanity shall
[32:50] be diminished so it speaks of one that
[32:52] loves silver and is never satisfied with
[32:54] silver he that loves abundance is never
[32:56] satisfied with increase but the man who
[32:57] just working because that's what he does
[33:00] it's what he's called to do is to labor
[33:01] and enjoy the fruits of his labor but
[33:03] his object and goal is not wealth or to
[33:05] be rich that man's sleep is sweet
[33:07] whether he has little or much because
[33:08] he's satisfied with character and
[33:10] integrity and the trusting in the Lord
[33:12] the abundance of the rich will not
[33:14] suffer him to
[33:16] sleep the abundance of the rich does not
[33:19] allow him to sleep it just
[33:22] compounds his fears and his
[33:25] anxieties if you go to bed and you have
[33:28] nothing you're not worried about thieves
[33:30] stealing
[33:32] it you're not worried about when the
[33:34] Stock Market opens tomorrow what's going
[33:36] to happen to my
[33:38] nothing I read a sign just yesterday it
[33:41] says people are always saying nothing's
[33:43] impossible that's not true I do nothing
[33:45] every
[33:47] day but if you have nothing or if you
[33:49] have little you're not worried about
[33:51] what's going to happen to it but if you
[33:52] have a lot it increases your worries and
[33:54] your
[33:55] fears there is a sore evil which I've
[33:57] seen Under the Sun namely riches kept
[33:59] for the owners thereof to their hurt he
[34:01] says this is a sore evil and as a rich
[34:04] man writing this I'm sure he could say
[34:06] this is insanity I've done all this he
[34:08] went after music and food and the best
[34:10] he tried to find a way to satisfy
[34:12] himself I've got all the wisdom in the
[34:14] world I've got all this I've got all
[34:15] that surely I can find this secret to
[34:17] happiness and he's realizing riches does
[34:19] not satisfy wealth does not satisfy
[34:21] entertainment does not satisfy he says
[34:23] this is a sore
[34:25] evil that riches kept for the owners
[34:28] to their hurt but those riches perish by
[34:31] evil travail and he Beth a son and
[34:33] there's nothing in his hand in other
[34:34] words you can accumulate a lot of wealth
[34:37] and have a child that you think you're
[34:38] going to leave it to and it not be there
[34:40] when it goes to
[34:43] pass it's about I know maybe we're talk
[34:46] may seem like we're talking about money
[34:47] but we're talking about greed we're
[34:49] talking about how we mortgage our homes
[34:51] do don't take out a home equity loan do
[34:54] a reverse a home equity line of credit
[34:56] in the spiritual sense right that's what
[34:58] we're talking about these transactions
[34:59] we enter into where we're going in debt
[35:01] to the world and the world's given us
[35:04] something but we've got to give them our
[35:05] home in order to get it our home life
[35:08] and I'm maybe I am zeroing in on this
[35:10] idea of money and wealth and possessions
[35:12] and gain and this logy and mindset to
[35:15] you to speak to this concept but it's
[35:17] all through the
[35:19] scripture 16 of Jesus's 38 Parables deal
[35:22] with money or
[35:23] possessions one out of 10 verses there's
[35:25] 288 in total in the Gospels focused
[35:28] directly on the subject of money one out
[35:30] of
[35:31] 10 this this statistic I haven't taken
[35:34] the time to count them all myself but
[35:36] around 500 verses uh in the Bible are on
[35:38] prayer just less than 500 on
[35:41] faith over 2,000 verses dedicated to
[35:44] money and possessions
[35:46] wow around 500 on prayer less than 500
[35:49] on faith over
[35:52] 2,000 that address money and possessions
[35:58] I think that's remarkable and that's why
[36:01] I remarked on
[36:03] it I want to read you a statement we
[36:05] read this uh before when we were
[36:07] speaking on Revelation
[36:10] resolves
[36:13] complication just imagine where we live
[36:15] today and how this is described in
[36:17] society our enormously productive
[36:19] economy demands that we make consumption
[36:21] our way of
[36:23] life because we have such economy and
[36:26] listen econom is different now we're not
[36:27] actually producing literal products
[36:29] we're producing um unlimited inventory
[36:31] when it comes to games and
[36:33] technology that there's really no way
[36:35] how how does an accountant quantify
[36:38] assets when they're doing an audit on a
[36:39] software company that can produce 800
[36:42] billion digital
[36:44] widgets and value them at a dollar piece
[36:47] these are the real questions right so
[36:50] it's the economy is so vast it's so huge
[36:53] our enormously productive ecomony
[36:54] demands that we make consumption our way
[36:56] of life that we convert the buying and
[36:58] use of goods into
[37:01] rituals like our coffee and candles our
[37:05] bath routines right these are all our we
[37:07] convert the buying and use of goods into
[37:10] rituals we're encouraged to engage in
[37:12] rituals for our mental health right and
[37:15] so we've been we've been told to convert
[37:18] the buying and use of goods into rituals
[37:20] that we seek our spiritual satisfactions
[37:22] our ego satisfactions in consumption
[37:27] the more the measure of social status of
[37:30] social acceptance of prestige is now to
[37:33] be found in our consumptive patterns the
[37:37] very meaning and significance of our
[37:38] lives today expressed in consumptive
[37:41] terms the greater the pressures upon the
[37:44] individual to conform to safe and
[37:46] accepted social standards the more does
[37:48] he tend to express his aspirations and
[37:51] his individuality in terms of what he
[37:53] wears drives eats his home his cars his
[37:57] pattern of food serving his
[38:00] Hobbies these Commodities and services
[38:03] must be offered to the consumer with a
[38:05] special
[38:06] urgency we required not only forced
[38:09] draft consumption but expensive
[38:11] consumption as well we need things
[38:15] consumed burned up worn out replaced and
[38:19] discarded at an ever increasing Pace we
[38:22] need to have people eat drink D dress
[38:26] ride live with ever more complicated and
[38:29] therefore constantly more expensive
[38:34] consumption it Bears repeating but it's
[38:38] really long so I'm not going to repeat
[38:40] it but if anybody wants this
[38:43] quotation I'll provide it to you anybody
[38:45] want to guess when this was
[38:47] written
[38:50] 1955 Victor leau in the Journal of
[38:53] retailing some of you may
[38:55] subscribe this is what he's saying in
[38:58] 1955 it's exactly what brother randam
[39:00] saiding at the very same time how that
[39:03] there is this ever
[39:05] expanding desire to consume and how it
[39:08] becomes part of our our
[39:10] identity where where we get our coffee
[39:13] where we like to eat what we wear what
[39:15] we drive there's such polarization
[39:18] identity found in our consumption habits
[39:20] and so we're looking to the buying and
[39:23] use of goods notice how he says that we
[39:24] have to eat drink dress ride live
[39:28] he's in some ways capturing exactly what
[39:30] Jesus said it would be like as it was in
[39:32] the days of lot and the days of Noah so
[39:34] the Journal of retailing Victor laau is
[39:37] just parting and giving this song out
[39:39] there saying yeah we're there we've
[39:41] arrived in the age of this consumption
[39:43] yes where we're having to conform to
[39:46] these social standards the spirit of the
[39:47] age forces us into social habits the
[39:50] engaging in those social habits just
[39:51] increase the social
[39:53] pressure in 1955
[39:58] in Ephesians 4: 17 and 19 is telling us
[40:02] to not walk as the Gentiles walk in the
[40:04] vanity of their mind we'll skip to verse
[40:05] 19 who being past feeling have given
[40:08] themselves over unto lasciviousness to
[40:11] work all uncleanness with
[40:14] greediness the phrase is telling us that
[40:17] by walking in the vanity of their minds
[40:19] they are unable to determine what is
[40:21] actually necessary or sufficient so they
[40:24] work all uncleanness with greediness
[40:27] they engage in unclean things they skimp
[40:29] they cut Corners they're dishonest
[40:31] they're greedy for gain because they
[40:33] lack contentment in Simplicity they lack
[40:35] contentment with what they have and they
[40:37] don't have a heart and the wisdom to say
[40:39] this is good this is
[40:42] enough brother bandam says of the Lan
[40:45] age it cries that it has a great
[40:47] amplitude of all things but it keeps
[40:49] burning with desire like an unsatisfied
[40:53] fire this is exactly the where where
[40:55] mankind is today that they cry of this
[40:58] great amplitude of all things but it
[41:00] keeps burning with desire like an
[41:01] unsatisfied
[41:04] fire it it is true that much of the
[41:07] technology that we had 10 years ago
[41:10] could have been maintained and made
[41:12] affordable and we probably could have
[41:13] got by with it
[41:15] forever
[41:17] forever but it's say though we had the
[41:20] amplitude of things at that moment we
[41:23] burn with an unsatisfied unquenchable
[41:25] fire in the desire to improve to get
[41:27] better to to to uh integrate to consume
[41:30] and to get out there it's the it's the
[41:32] laws of economy it's the forces of of
[41:35] capitalism these are the things that are
[41:37] completely binding leod DEA he says they
[41:39] may have an amplitude of all things but
[41:41] when is it
[41:43] enough keeps burning with desire like an
[41:45] unsatisfied
[41:46] fire as Abraham maof says man is a
[41:49] perpetually wanting
[41:52] animal and the spirit of this age holds
[41:56] us back from true contentment we can
[41:58] have an amplitude of many
[42:01] things but but then we are burning with
[42:04] the desire that's unsatisfied we can
[42:08] possess a lot but still want even more
[42:10] because the spirit of a DEA holds us
[42:12] back from contentment for the sake of
[42:15] consumption Benjamin Franklin said money
[42:17] never made a man happy yet nor will it
[42:19] there's nothing in its nature to produce
[42:21] happiness the more man has the more he
[42:24] wants this is why we go back to
[42:25] Ecclesiastes chapter 5 this is just this
[42:28] is going back to the uh wealth gotten by
[42:30] V all these scriptures Benjamin Frankl
[42:32] is just quoting quoting scriptures or
[42:34] he's just summarizing the wisdom of
[42:36] scripture there's nothing in the nature
[42:37] of money to produce happiness the more a
[42:39] man has of money the more he wants
[42:41] instead of it's feeling a vacuum it
[42:43] makes
[42:44] one if you have a hole in your life and
[42:46] you think money is going to fill it up
[42:47] no as soon as you put money in there to
[42:49] fill up the hole it creates another
[42:52] hole if it satisfies one want it doubles
[42:55] and trebles that want another way
[42:58] so if you think money is going to
[42:59] satisfy a desire in your heart it may
[43:02] satisfy it but it has the effect of
[43:04] doubling it and tripling that want in
[43:08] another way because he that loves silver
[43:10] never has enough silver he that loves
[43:12] abundance never has enough
[43:14] increase in Mark chapter 10 vers verses
[43:17] 24 and 25 if I go fast enough we could
[43:20] finish then Jesus beholding him this is
[43:22] the Rich Young Ruler I won't give a lot
[43:23] of the context we'll just jump right
[43:25] into this he's looking at the Rich Young
[43:27] young ruler who said I've kept all thy
[43:29] Commandments from thy youth my my all
[43:30] these he says one thing thou lackest go
[43:32] thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[43:34] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[43:36] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[43:38] cross and follow me quite a statement
[43:41] and he the Rich Young Ruler was sad at
[43:43] that saying and went away Greed for he
[43:45] had great possessions he asked what he
[43:47] could do to have e eternal life Jesus
[43:50] tells him what he can do essentially and
[43:53] he doesn't want to engage in that
[43:55] transaction it was something he wanted
[43:58] in the analysis in the moment he said
[44:00] great possessions uh uh in following CH
[44:03] get rid of the possessions to follow
[44:04] Christ and in the quick analysis it says
[44:06] he walked away sad because he wasn't
[44:08] willing to make the investment he wasn't
[44:10] willing to exchange what he had gained
[44:12] in the world for what Christ was
[44:13] offering him and so Jesus in verse 23
[44:17] remarks once this happens he looks
[44:19] around and says to his disciples how
[44:21] hardly shall they that have riches enter
[44:23] into the kingdom of God so it's his
[44:26] remark about the situation he's
[44:28] commenting on the circumstances of the
[44:30] Rich Young Ruler and how he's just
[44:31] turned down eternal life just rejected
[44:33] the opportunity to follow Christ he says
[44:35] man how hard it is for those that are
[44:36] rich to enter the kingdom of God and the
[44:38] disciples were astonished at his words
[44:40] but Jesus anth again and saith unto them
[44:43] children how hard is it for them that
[44:45] trusteth in riches to enter into the
[44:47] kingdom of God now he's not asking it as
[44:49] a question he's doubling down on his
[44:50] statement that it's so hard how hardly
[44:53] shall they so it leaves this room oh
[44:55] barely it's going to be difficult they
[44:57] that have riches to enter the kingdom of
[44:58] God how hard it is for them that trust
[45:01] in riches to enter into the kingdom of
[45:03] God so now it's the Trust In The Riches
[45:05] that become the focal point it's easier
[45:07] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[45:09] needle than for a rich man to enter into
[45:11] the kingdom of
[45:13] God I will acknowledge and for all those
[45:15] whove been following my Ministry over 25
[45:17] years since I've been preaching
[45:18] preaching I'll acknowledge that I use
[45:20] the analogy of the Gate of the city as
[45:22] being the eye of the needle I admit that
[45:24] I heard somebody else say it but I can't
[45:25] find it anywhere else where that's the
[45:27] truth you know in terms of the Jewish
[45:29] tradition and history but the Jews did
[45:31] have a saying at the time about a camel
[45:33] going through the eye of the needle it's
[45:35] not a play on words like a cable through
[45:37] an eye of a needle or a chem Jesus is
[45:40] exaggerating for the purpose of making a
[45:43] point it is easier for a camel to go
[45:45] through the eye of the needle than for a
[45:46] rich man to enter the kingdom of God
[45:48] he's making a point to point out the
[45:50] near impossibility of a rich man to
[45:52] enter in he's using a phrase a cliche
[45:55] that would have been common at that time
[45:57] time about a camel going through the eye
[45:58] of the needle and they're literally
[46:00] refer figuratively referring to a camel
[46:02] though literally a camel going through
[46:03] the eye of a needle and it's like that
[46:05] doesn't happen right and he's want he's
[46:08] using exaggeration he's using it for the
[46:10] force of the argument because the
[46:11] disciples are still shocked like man
[46:13] he's doubled down on this he's using
[46:15] this phrase that we would use to express
[46:17] that ain't
[46:20] happening why because Christ recognizes
[46:24] something in the character of the Rich
[46:25] Young Ruler
[46:27] Proverbs Paul
[46:30] Ecclesiastes we could just pull from all
[46:32] sorts of scriptures the message of the
[46:33] hour Ephesians all these different
[46:35] places and Christ here recognizes how
[46:38] that riches gain greed negatively impact
[46:42] character it influences the human mind I
[46:45] wrote These down just to be able to
[46:46] share these as a summary from these
[46:48] things riches increased anxiety and care
[46:52] and distract us from the things of
[46:54] God this is what the scriptures tell us
[46:56] that the sleep of a laboring man is
[46:58] sweet but the abundance of the rich will
[46:59] not suffer him to sleep riches increase
[47:01] our nervousness our anxiety and they
[47:04] distract us from the things of God
[47:07] riches tend to provoke
[47:08] covetousness that the more the man a man
[47:11] has the more he wants again I'm summing
[47:12] what we've read to you in these terms
[47:14] they tend to provoke jealousy and
[47:16] covetousness it's hard to have them
[47:18] without loving
[47:20] them he that loveth silver is not
[47:22] satisfied with silver why does he love
[47:24] silver when we have it we tend to love
[47:26] it we we tend to have an inor affection
[47:28] towards it and therefore having them
[47:30] we're inclined to trust in
[47:32] them trust in them for our happiness far
[47:35] as security instead of God trust in it
[47:37] where we're afraid to let it go when God
[47:39] asked us to because we trust in that
[47:42] measure of securing us and securing our
[47:45] future and keeping us where we need to
[47:47] be then we do trust in
[47:49] God and having them we think more highly
[47:51] of ourselves because of
[47:54] them and having them is extremely
[47:57] difficult to use them
[47:58] correctly because we tend to view them
[48:01] ourselves as the owner of them instead
[48:04] of a steward of
[48:06] them think about it I know you're all
[48:09] thinking why couldn't he preach this on
[48:10] Sunday
[48:12] morning but I'd rather preach it to
[48:14] those who can really get into it take it
[48:16] to heart not to say that people on
[48:19] Sunday couldn't but i' I'd rather I'd
[48:21] rather it be you who are listening and
[48:23] hanging on every word willing to apply
[48:25] it to themselves it I preach things that
[48:27] are very very hard and people that you
[48:28] would think that that that was not
[48:30] intended for them at all they' be the
[48:31] last people thinking of like man I'm
[48:33] really challenging myself on this I'm
[48:34] really getting serious about this I'm
[48:35] really digging down deep and you're
[48:36] thinking whoa wow this is awesome people
[48:39] taking it to heart really weighing these
[48:41] things out I think it's good for us to
[48:42] think about this Christ is saying how
[48:44] hard it is for them that trust in riches
[48:46] into the kingdom of God why it corrupts
[48:47] character makes it really really hard
[48:49] that when you have wealth you tend to
[48:50] love it when you have wealth it tends to
[48:52] cause you to trust in it when you have
[48:53] wealth it tends to cause you anxiety and
[48:55] pressures when you have wealth it's
[48:57] really hard to use it
[48:59] correctly and so Paul says hopefully
[49:02] this becomes our our turning point where
[49:03] we can head to the finish line so Paul
[49:05] says in the final analysis of or not the
[49:08] final analysis but when he begins to
[49:10] turn it down on Timothy godliness with
[49:11] contentment is great gain and all these
[49:13] people who chased after money chased
[49:15] after this has pierced them through the
[49:16] love of money is the root of all evil he
[49:17] says oh thou man of God 1 Timothy 611
[49:20] flee these
[49:21] things flee the lust to be rich flee
[49:24] Being Greedy for gain flee laboring to
[49:26] be Rich flee these things and follow
[49:28] after labor for this righteousness
[49:30] godliness Faith love patience meekness
[49:33] have a different goal have a vision
[49:35] different Vision have a different
[49:36] balance sheet that when people are
[49:39] comparing their their bank account
[49:41] balance you think of your spiritual
[49:43] righteousness balance your Trust balance
[49:45] your character balance your faith
[49:46] balance you begin to think of things
[49:47] that matter and someone says man I'm
[49:49] making six figures now or I've got this
[49:51] investment my investment in in in and
[49:54] this altcoin has quadrupled and and and
[49:57] they're really excited about everything
[49:58] and maybe you missed out on an
[49:59] opportunity maybe it didn't happen but
[50:01] you can be satisfied if you're laboring
[50:03] correctly doing a job right you have
[50:05] integrity you have character you have
[50:07] honesty maybe you don't have a lot but
[50:08] you sleep
[50:10] well maybe you don't have a lot but
[50:11] you're pleasing your heavenly Father in
[50:13] Heaven who's promised you the righteous
[50:15] aren't going to be forsaken the
[50:16] righteous are not going to be begging
[50:17] for bread that there is a promise where
[50:19] we're trusting him what are you trusting
[50:21] in I'm not trusting in stock markets I'm
[50:23] not trusting in the next election cycle
[50:24] to fix our economy I'm trusting in
[50:28] God it's a different Vision a different
[50:30] goal completely different set of
[50:32] accounting
[50:33] rules the Bible says in Psalms 37:16 use
[50:37] this when you do your next audit a
[50:38] little that a righteous man hath is
[50:40] better than the riches of many Wicked
[50:42] you notice what he just did there a
[50:44] little that a single righteous man has
[50:47] is better than the riches of many Wicked
[50:49] right put the one% up there put all the
[50:51] billionaires up there a little that you
[50:53] have as righteous children of God is
[50:56] better than all the riches of the
[51:00] wicked godliness with contentment is
[51:02] true
[51:03] wealth as Paul said it's great gain this
[51:06] is different from worldly success this
[51:08] is different from the the measure of
[51:10] worldly riches it's contrary to the
[51:11] spirit of leot DEA godliness it's
[51:14] reverence and respect for God it's
[51:16] deferring to God it's Devotion to God
[51:20] godliness with contentment putting God
[51:22] first putting Christ first godliness
[51:24] with content contentment is sufficiency
[51:26] I'm this is sufficient it's a happy mind
[51:29] to have contentment with this is to be
[51:31] rest at rest or satisfied that I'm
[51:34] satisfied when iwake in thy likeness I'm
[51:37] satisfied when I put you first I'm
[51:39] satisfied when I do the right thing
[51:42] satisfied when I labor correctly I'm
[51:43] satisfied when I have the right response
[51:45] to my wife I'm satisfied when I feel
[51:46] like I handled a diffic difficult
[51:49] situation that pleases Lord I'm
[51:51] satisfied when I when I uh examine
[51:53] myself I satisfied when I see Holiness
[51:55] I'm satisfi when I crave for
[51:58] righteousness as Paul said in 1 Timothy
[52:01] 65 per perverse disputant of men of
[52:03] corrupt minds and destitute supposing
[52:05] that gain is godliness he says withdraw
[52:07] yourselves from them from the mindset
[52:10] from that
[52:13] momentum they suppose that gain is
[52:15] godliness gain is not godliness
[52:17] godliness is Devotion to
[52:19] God a little that a righteous man has is
[52:22] better than the many The Riches of many
[52:24] Wicked in Proverbs 15:16 better a little
[52:26] with the fear of the Lord than great
[52:28] treasure and trouble
[52:30] therewith it's better to have a little
[52:32] and be
[52:33] righteous it's better have little with
[52:35] the fear of the Lord they have a lot of
[52:37] treasure and All the Troubles that come
[52:39] with
[52:41] it when we speak of a mortgaged
[52:48] home it's not about borrowing money as
[52:50] we said on
[52:51] Sunday it's not even about incurring
[52:54] debt we're not
[52:57] we're not just looking at those
[52:59] things and and put trying to shine a
[53:01] light on those who might have credit
[53:03] balances or borrow money to buy a home
[53:04] that's not it at all but it's about
[53:05] burdening our home
[53:07] spiritually because we lack
[53:10] wisdom the house of the Lord is a home
[53:14] been thinking about this in terms
[53:16] of what makes a house a home in Christ
[53:22] Christ is what makes a house a home the
[53:25] house of the Lord was not home until the
[53:27] presence of God came down inside of it
[53:31] so Christ's character this divine order
[53:33] the presence of God is what makes a
[53:35] house a
[53:37] home I was thinking there's never a
[53:40] place that isn't a home where Christ
[53:43] is because brother R says when Christ
[53:45] leaves your home Trouble Comes right
[53:47] trouble's on its way when Christ leaves
[53:49] your home why because it's Christ is
[53:50] what makes it a
[53:52] home and a
[53:55] mortgage is a death pledge it's the
[53:58] literal meaning of the word a death
[54:01] pledge a mortgage is an incumbrance upon
[54:04] a property that diminishes its
[54:07] value you may own a house that's worth a
[54:10] million dollars but if you have a
[54:11] mortgage that's also a million dollar
[54:13] you don't have a million dollars are you
[54:16] listening I want to I want to end
[54:18] tonight I'm probably going to end up
[54:19] skipping a lot of stuff and we can
[54:21] always just pick up on it Sunday if the
[54:22] Lord terries so think as I want I had to
[54:24] get to the spot where my title is at
[54:26] least makes sense a mortgage diminishes
[54:29] the value of your property yes yes a
[54:33] borrower gives consideration in the form
[54:35] of collateral that's the that's in the
[54:37] an actual transaction the house is
[54:39] offered up as security as collateral you
[54:41] borrow money that's the benefit you get
[54:43] but now I'm saying what do we give up as
[54:46] consideration what are we giving up as
[54:48] collateral our home for
[54:51] gain because you know what happens when
[54:53] you enter into a transaction a mortgage
[54:55] a death pledge
[54:57] if you don't
[54:58] pay in the event of
[55:01] default the one that you issued the
[55:03] mortgage to the one you issued the
[55:05] security to the one that you made a
[55:06] death pledge
[55:08] to can take possession of the collateral
[55:11] it's called a
[55:19] forclosure there's those that
[55:21] argue that if you owe the bank money
[55:25] then it's really really not even your
[55:27] house there's some that look at it that
[55:29] way and I can see the argument they're
[55:30] trying to make maybe there's some
[55:32] semantics or Nuance there but let's just
[55:33] think in a spiritual sense if we've
[55:36] pledged some part of home life as
[55:38] security to the world for what we can
[55:40] get out of
[55:42] it now we are in debt to the world and
[55:46] we've pledged that part it's burdened
[55:48] now it's it's it there's one who's first
[55:51] in line who has a lean on it not the
[55:52] Lord You're not trusting to him you're
[55:54] not trusting him the world has a lean
[55:56] lean on that peace the world has a lean
[55:58] on that satisfaction the world has a
[56:00] lean on that joy and you're trying to
[56:01] catch up oh one day if we get out of
[56:03] debt one day if we do this one day if we
[56:04] do that and you think that one day
[56:05] you're going to be able to go back to
[56:06] the pawn shop and get it back but you've
[56:09] you've you've mortgaged something right
[56:12] you've mortgaged something and if the
[56:14] debts not paid they foreclose on it and
[56:16] you lose possession of
[56:18] it so I just say don't pledge
[56:21] it and I I believe that God is the one
[56:24] who can take that God has made a promise
[56:25] he could take that right out of the
[56:27] Filthy Hands of the world and give it
[56:28] back to you so when he say don't a
[56:30] mortgaged home don't Pledge Your
[56:32] Peaceable habitation don't Pledge Your
[56:34] sure dwelling don't Pledge Your quiet
[56:36] resting
[56:37] place the Bible says the servant is uh
[56:40] the rich rules rules over the poor and
[56:43] the borrower is servant to the lender in
[56:46] other words a servant is that the
[56:47] lender's
[56:48] Mercy it's for you're forced to be
[56:50] subject to it creates a power Dynamic
[56:52] where they can control you and they can
[56:54] demand certain things of you debt brings
[56:57] in the a relationship of
[57:00] dependence I want you to think about
[57:02] these things when it comes to our
[57:03] spiritual transactions or maybe better
[57:05] said our carnal transactions and what
[57:07] kind of relationship and power dynamics
[57:09] being created to where you've given up
[57:11] something of value to receive something
[57:14] from the world and then it creates this
[57:16] negative Dynamic where you have to
[57:17] satisfy certain things you have to
[57:19] fulfill certain things and you feel
[57:20] compelled to do certain
[57:23] things just even borrowing on that
[57:25] thought mind said of those that owe on
[57:27] their house don't truly own it but I'd
[57:28] say a Believer with a mortgaged home is
[57:30] not a true
[57:32] homeowner because that's not what God's
[57:34] called us to do
[57:38] amen God's called us to possess it
[57:40] absolutely and
[57:42] completely I'll close with this
[57:45] statement will the church go before the
[57:49] tribulation Brothers if you could come
[57:51] to your instruments
[57:53] again I I'm realizing just now I'm not
[57:56] getting to what I wanted to get to on
[57:58] Sunday I I'd like to uh look at that
[58:01] other side where flee these things and
[58:03] pursue this other that there's these
[58:04] righteous Pursuits that we can that we
[58:06] can pursue that do fill the vacuum and
[58:09] don't treble things the other way in the
[58:11] days of lot they were eating drinking
[58:13] marrying giving in marriage planting
[58:15] building selling buying oh there never
[58:16] was a day that's so much commercial as
[58:19] today just use car lots and everything
[58:22] so much till you can buy a refrigerate
[58:24] this year and pay about $400 or $500 for
[58:26] oh I wish and next year nobody wants it
[58:29] it's out of style now it doesn't work
[58:32] because they've upgraded the firmware
[58:33] and it doesn't communicate with the
[58:34] networks anymore right like how in the
[58:37] world does a refrigerator you can't even
[58:39] buy a print a coffee maker has to
[58:40] connect to the Smart Hub and if you use
[58:44] a different kind of K cup or whatever it
[58:46] is than the one that communicates with
[58:48] the worldwide web and Al gor over they
[58:50] going no uhuh that's not it you can't
[58:52] use that it's
[58:54] obsolete notice we're where we are today
[58:57] when Victor laau is saying what he did
[58:58] in the 1955 brother Brams 1958 he's
[59:01] saying this is where we
[59:03] are buying and selling so commercial
[59:06] things going out of style don't you see
[59:08] where the commercial world has your nose
[59:10] to the Grind wheel you buy a car this
[59:12] year next year it's probably as good as
[59:14] the one you could buy then but it didn't
[59:15] it it'll depreciate $1,000 because they
[59:18] changed the radiator cap or they done
[59:21] some little silly something to it they
[59:23] said oh no no no no we changed it it
[59:25] goes like this now not like this like I
[59:28] can't see the difference between this
[59:29] model and that model yeah but this model
[59:31] goes like this and that model goes like
[59:32] that
[59:34] like okay it's the radiator cap all
[59:37] right this is what we're caught up
[59:42] in and they done some little some silly
[59:45] thing to it it's only a cell's talk to
[59:47] fulfill the
[59:49] Bible as it was in the days of
[59:51] Noah as it was in the days of lot or
[59:55] here right in the middle middle of it
[59:56] right in the thick of it Le O
[59:59] deia commercialism has our nose to the
[1:00:02] grindstone capitalism has our nose to
[1:00:05] the
[1:00:06] grindstone it's not a debate as to what
[1:00:08] works best in terms of economies free
[1:00:11] market or
[1:00:13] otherwise my point is you belong to a
[1:00:16] different
[1:00:17] one that you can be investing in you
[1:00:20] realize we consider ourselves to be the
[1:00:21] bride of Christ and would we agree that
[1:00:23] there's bride members around the
[1:00:24] world there's bride members that exist
[1:00:27] completely within socialist economies
[1:00:30] and socialist governments and communism
[1:00:32] are they any less bride because they
[1:00:35] have to operate by socialist
[1:00:37] rule there's Believers in in Europe who
[1:00:40] are legally not allowed to homeschool
[1:00:42] are they any less Christian because
[1:00:45] legally and by the laws of the land
[1:00:46] they're not able to homeschool I'm
[1:00:48] asking a serious question when it comes
[1:00:50] to manner of life and living and what we
[1:00:52] pursue and our liberties and our
[1:00:53] freedoms and all the things that are
[1:00:54] made available to us there's a lot lot
[1:00:56] of things that were beginning to be told
[1:00:57] As Americans that are our god-given
[1:00:59] rights that in reality has completely H
[1:01:02] H uh misled and perverts the scripture
[1:01:05] because we want to stand up to for the
[1:01:07] right to bear arms the right to do this
[1:01:08] and the right to do that how about
[1:01:10] leaving that to the politicians and you
[1:01:13] serve God which is your
[1:01:15] right and you Comm completely commit
[1:01:18] yourself to his
[1:01:20] economy so I will not sell my home I
[1:01:23] will not mortgage my home I will not
[1:01:26] take advantage of all the things that
[1:01:27] the world wants to sell me I'm not going
[1:01:29] to be brainwashed into thinking that
[1:01:31] that makes me more of a Christian
[1:01:32] because I can pursue capitalism because
[1:01:34] I can pursue these Liberties what makes
[1:01:37] you a Christian is when you're subject
[1:01:39] to other laws and other orders in a
[1:01:42] completely different
[1:01:44] economy and we're living in that time
[1:01:46] the day when the son of man is being
[1:01:47] revealed and I encourage you to feed on
[1:01:50] that to feed on that to focus on
[1:01:53] that the scriptures speaking Us in such
[1:01:56] a beautiful way that we can begin to
[1:01:58] store up Treasures in the right places
[1:02:00] in the right
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:03] way God help
[1:02:06] us God help us I I'm just going to try
[1:02:10] to finish it very quickly I can do this
[1:02:12] Jesus said lay up for yourselves
[1:02:13] Treasures in Heaven where your treasure
[1:02:15] is there your treasure will be also
[1:02:16] where your heart is there your treasure
[1:02:17] will be also where your treasure is your
[1:02:20] heart will be also heart ambition
[1:02:23] affection and it's saying home is that
[1:02:25] that place where you have your deepest
[1:02:27] affection home is the place where you
[1:02:29] have your that emotional pull where your
[1:02:32] treasure it means that place that you
[1:02:34] store things up a place where precious
[1:02:36] things are collected and stored through
[1:02:38] wisdom is a house builded through
[1:02:40] knowledge shall it be made established
[1:02:42] and
[1:02:43] fixed or by understanding it's
[1:02:45] established and through knowledge it's
[1:02:46] filled with all precious and pleasant
[1:02:51] riches this is this is the way this is
[1:02:53] the way to happiness in a home the fear
[1:02:56] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[1:02:58] and the knowledge of the Holy is
[1:03:00] understanding that reverence and
[1:03:01] obedience to
[1:03:03] God if we don't have reverence in
[1:03:05] obedience to God if we don't have
[1:03:07] godliness then all other wisdom all
[1:03:09] other knowledge is
[1:03:12] vain and so it's by these things the
[1:03:14] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:03:15] wisdom this is how a house is
[1:03:17] built knowledge of the Holy is
[1:03:20] understanding that's how it's
[1:03:21] established this is how we fill our
[1:03:22] homes by Revelation by faith is how we
[1:03:24] fill our homes with enjoyable things
[1:03:27] wisdom is the principal thing therefore
[1:03:29] get wisdom and with all thy getting get
[1:03:32] understanding this is what the Bible
[1:03:34] tell us that we ought to value in
[1:03:36] Jeremiah it says thus sayith the Lord
[1:03:37] let not wise man glory in his wisdom
[1:03:39] neither let the Mighty Man glory in his
[1:03:40] might let not the rich man glory in his
[1:03:42] riches but let him that glorieth glory
[1:03:44] in this that he hath he understandeth
[1:03:47] and knoweth me who what other generation
[1:03:50] could we say this to but you who sit
[1:03:52] here right now in 2024 with the word
[1:03:54] that's been opened up to you who who
[1:03:55] else could we say this to to say those
[1:03:58] wisdom is the principal thing get wisdom
[1:04:00] with all th getting get understanding
[1:04:01] and let us not joy in Earthly wisdom let
[1:04:04] neither glory in our physical strength
[1:04:06] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[1:04:08] but let us glory in that we understand
[1:04:10] and know him that I am the Lord which
[1:04:12] exercises loving kindness judgment and
[1:04:14] righteousness in the Earth for in these
[1:04:15] things I Delight Paul said charge them
[1:04:18] that are rich in this world that they be
[1:04:20] not high-m minded nor trusted un certain
[1:04:21] riches but in the Living God who give us
[1:04:23] richly all things to a joy that they do
[1:04:26] good that they be rich in Good Works
[1:04:28] ready to distribute willing to
[1:04:29] communicate this is a complete change in
[1:04:32] terms of what we ought to
[1:04:34] pursue it's g i think it's given us
[1:04:36] practical things we say well I got a job
[1:04:38] I got this I got these bills I got that
[1:04:39] bill I got I got all these things I need
[1:04:40] to do okay it's there debt s snowballs
[1:04:43] work certain approaches work there's
[1:04:45] ways that you can get out of debt
[1:04:46] there's ways that you can go through
[1:04:47] your finances but listen what good is
[1:04:49] all that if this doesn't become first
[1:04:52] yes sir you know what happened if you
[1:04:54] get out of debt you'll be like
[1:04:56] and you don't trust the Lord like man I
[1:04:58] can do this and you won't be afraid to
[1:05:00] Rack it up again because you're going to
[1:05:01] think you can just get out of it listen
[1:05:03] I'll just use the analogy of losing
[1:05:04] weight when I was a certain age I could
[1:05:06] gain 20 pounds and lose it like that and
[1:05:07] then there comes the point well once
[1:05:08] you've gained that 20 you ain't ever
[1:05:09] getting rid of it right because you
[1:05:12] played with it too much or maybe you
[1:05:14] just get old and if you think you can
[1:05:16] just always get yourself out of debt get
[1:05:18] yourself out of debt listen one day it's
[1:05:19] going to be too late like oh man I can't
[1:05:22] get out of this one I'm in a pickle I
[1:05:23] can't do it and I realized that medical
[1:05:25] EXP expenses and job loss and inflation
[1:05:27] and reduced income create fin Financial
[1:05:29] pressure but then the poor use of credit
[1:05:31] and the bad money management
[1:05:32] overspending just increase that pressure
[1:05:34] I realize these things are real these
[1:05:36] things are true but I there that's one
[1:05:39] thing that's one thing that the Lord can
[1:05:40] do with you that's things that you can
[1:05:41] be taught from the scripture how to be
[1:05:42] prudent in finances but I don't want to
[1:05:44] try to get you how to manage your money
[1:05:47] thing without saying look the most
[1:05:49] important thing is put Christ first put
[1:05:52] him first so he can put a fear in your
[1:05:53] heart about being irresp responsible
[1:05:56] with the things he blesses you with and
[1:05:57] say listen if I get a paycheck it's from
[1:05:59] him if I get a promotion it's from him
[1:06:01] if I have anything in this world all
[1:06:03] good things have come from him and I'll
[1:06:05] give him glory and I'll have a fear and
[1:06:07] a reverence of God to manage what he's
[1:06:09] given me correctly and that's a great
[1:06:10] place to
[1:06:12] start living where the son of man is
[1:06:14] being
[1:06:15] revealed he said I'll never leave thee
[1:06:17] nor forsake thee and that's why we can
[1:06:20] to say let your conversation be without
[1:06:21] covetousness be content with such things
[1:06:24] as you have cuz he says I will never
[1:06:25] leave thee nor forsake
[1:06:28] thee brother brandham says in the sermon
[1:06:30] and knoweth it
[1:06:33] not this is in 196 August 15th
[1:06:37] 1965 just watch stay close to
[1:06:41] Christ let me warn you now as a minister
[1:06:44] of the Gospel of this don't take any
[1:06:47] foolishness don't imagine anything stay
[1:06:51] right there until this inside of the
[1:06:53] inside is anchored to the word that
[1:06:54] you're right in Christ cuz that's the
[1:06:56] only thing that's going
[1:06:58] to he says cuz we're in the most
[1:07:01] deceiving age that we've ever lived in
[1:07:03] now if you could enter into this
[1:07:05] admonishment that how direct he's being
[1:07:08] the the intensity with which the Holy
[1:07:10] Spirit would be projecting this to the
[1:07:12] bride at this moment in his ministry him
[1:07:14] not necessarily knowing what's coming
[1:07:16] but him say stay close to Christ let me
[1:07:17] warn you be anchored on the inside to
[1:07:19] the word it's the most deceiving age
[1:07:20] we've ever been it would deceive the
[1:07:21] very elected if it was possible because
[1:07:23] they had anointing they could do
[1:07:24] anything like the rest of them them and
[1:07:26] he says clean your lives up pay your
[1:07:32] debts I mean don't we want to get more
[1:07:34] into a debate about who the defilers of
[1:07:37] the message are thematically and
[1:07:39] theologically and he's saying no just
[1:07:40] clean your lives up and pay your debts
[1:07:42] brother BR name names tell us who the
[1:07:44] deceivers are no clean your life up and

[1:08:04] sudden he grabbed the wrong set of notes
[1:08:05] and it was his Todo list the next day

[1:08:58] on us I believe we're at the end I say
[1:09:01] this just to give some context and
[1:09:03] urgency I believe the son of man is
[1:09:05] revealed himself in this hour I know
[1:09:07] that there's a way that we could preach
[1:09:09] that that tickles our ears and it makes
[1:09:10] us feel really good in terms of what's
[1:09:12] happened in the Fulfillment of scripture
[1:09:14] but if it doesn't translate to a life
[1:09:16] lived by the word if it doesn't
[1:09:18] translate to better relationships among
[1:09:20] those that we love if it doesn't
[1:09:21] translate to cleaning up our lives and
[1:09:23] paying our debts then we're missing
[1:09:25] something in the
[1:09:27] translation yes sir oh God help us what
[1:09:31] are we coming here for what are we doing
[1:09:32] are we just playing a game we just
[1:09:35] meeting at a
[1:09:36] lodge but are we pursuing
[1:09:40] righteousness we pursuing the right
[1:09:43] things oh God help us to do the right
[1:09:47] thing and if you have a mortgage on your
