[0:00] I'd like to continue on the subject of
[0:02] the kingdom and we've been speaking
[0:05] about two Edens for the last few
[0:07] services tonight my title is the devil's
[0:10] lie versus the truth of God and I'm
[0:14] taking that phrasing directly from the
[0:15] message of the hour uh the phrase the
[0:17] devil's lie as it opposes or is against
[0:20] the truth of God
[0:21] and I feel in some ways I'm dropping
[0:24] back a little bit just covering
[0:25] something that's a fundamental principle
[0:27] and as I've been looking at things in
[0:30] the future home of the Heavenly
[0:32] bridegroom and the Earthly bride and
[0:34] been studying in different places I
[0:36] realize there's some things that are
[0:38] real foundational and principles that
[0:39] relate to the word of God that would be
[0:41] really good for us to understand before
[0:42] we go further and so I'm just kind of
[0:44] laying a a necessary Foundation tonight
[0:47] and but a lot of what we're going to use
[0:50] to do that is things that we've already
[0:51] been covering over the last few services
[0:53] or several services for that matter
[0:55] and uh to give some placing for the
[0:58] title The Devil's lie versus the truth
[1:01] of God in the church age book brother
[1:03] Branham referring to Babel in Babylon he
[1:07] said the devil's lie and the devil's
[1:09] Mysteries rose up against the truth of
[1:12] God and the mysteries of God in that
[1:15] City so there's the Tower of Babel is
[1:17] what we're thinking about we're thinking
[1:18] about the beginning of Babylon and he
[1:21] says the devil's lie knows the singular
[1:23] lie gives rise to a lot of mysteries the
[1:25] devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries
[1:27] rise up against so it's versus it's
[1:30] combating it's suing it's a it's
[1:32] opposing the truth of God and the
[1:34] mysteries of God he says it's in that
[1:36] City
[1:37] and recall how brother Branham talked
[1:39] about the two Edens and he used Matthew
[1:40] 24 24 to introduce the two Edens and he
[1:43] said the end time these two Edens will
[1:45] be so close together that if it were
[1:48] possible the false Eden would trick the
[1:50] believer into thinking that it was the
[1:52] true Eden and so there's going to be in
[1:55] Eden there's going to be a city there's
[1:56] going to be a woman that will appear
[1:58] righteous and holy and of God and the
[2:01] Bride of Jesus Christ but yet she's not
[2:03] going to be that she's going to be that
[2:05] false Christ the the analogy of the
[2:08] tares or even we could say uh
[2:10] however example you want to use they're
[2:13] all part of that City that brother
[2:15] Brown's talking about here that is the
[2:16] devil's lie in the devil's Mysteries
[2:18] that rise up against God in that City we
[2:21] could use the phrase the beast at the
[2:22] beginning and it's the beast at the
[2:24] beginning that brought forth nimrod's
[2:26] Kingdom and it was in opposition to God
[2:28] in opposition to God's word and it's the
[2:31] beast at the end that brings forth
[2:33] Satan's Eden and it's the beast that's
[2:35] giving power it's the beast that's
[2:36] raising up and it's what brings forth
[2:38] Satan Eden Satan's Eden and think of it
[2:40] this way what begins as a tower and
[2:43] begins as a kingdom uh there in the
[2:45] Middle East and there in a very specific
[2:47] area by the river Euphrates it starts
[2:50] there but by the time it's done in
[2:52] Babylon encompasses the whole Earth
[2:55] so when God brother Branham is
[2:56] describing Satan's Eden and he's using
[2:58] the Book of Revelation to describe it
[3:00] he's not just pointing to a a seat where
[3:03] a kingdom has originated and exist in
[3:05] one area and it's only expanded in that
[3:07] region it's now the whole world the
[3:10] whole world has become a kingdom unto
[3:12] Satan and as brother Brandon says in a
[3:15] church age book thus the mysteries of
[3:17] Babylon spread
[3:19] from Nation to Nation until it appeared
[3:21] in Rome and China India and even in both
[3:23] North and South America we find the very
[3:26] same basic worship
[3:29] so the Tower of Babel Grew From one
[3:31] tower that was trying to rise up uh to
[3:33] the heavens and now it grows to mystery
[3:36] Babylon of Revelations chapter 17 and
[3:38] chapter 18. it's much bigger much
[3:40] broader than just one Tower where all
[3:42] the people of the Earth had gathered and
[3:44] we've been contrasting the two Edens
[3:46] God's Eden and Satan's Eden and we found
[3:50] uh the contrast and we could see the
[3:53] contrast and the comparison of the two
[3:56] cities that come up in the Book of
[3:57] Revelation and there's the city that
[4:00] we've looked at as mystery Babylon and
[4:02] then at the end we see the New Jerusalem
[4:05] and I'm having a hard time hearing your
[4:07] amens over all my fans tonight so
[4:09] I want to I want to I want to hear your
[4:12] amens but it's the mystery Babylon is
[4:14] the one city and then the other city is
[4:16] the New Jerusalem the the mystery
[4:18] Babylon is the culmination of Satan's
[4:21] kingdom the New Jerusalem is the
[4:22] culmination of the kingdom and so it's
[4:25] it's just neat how these things arise up
[4:27] at the very end and Satan's kingdom when
[4:30] it's come to its Perfection it's come to
[4:32] the Perfection of its beauty if you want
[4:34] to use that phrasing Satan's kingdom
[4:36] scripturally is described as a harlot
[4:39] uh it's a woman it's a harlot not called
[4:41] The Bride not called the wife but it's
[4:42] called it's a woman and it's symbolized
[4:44] as a harlot but then God's kingdom is
[4:46] represented as a bride
[4:48] and so despite and I think that in
[4:51] itself is something to really think
[4:52] about how that Satan's kingdom is
[4:54] referred to as a woman God's kingdom is
[4:56] referred to as a woman but the Bible
[4:58] says this one's a harlot and this one's
[5:01] a bride this one's Unfaithful this one's
[5:04] faithful this one's unrighteous this one
[5:06] is righteous but yet despite what we
[5:09] could say is the apparent disparity in
[5:11] scripture between a harlot and a bride
[5:13] Satan's kingdom is deceptively beautiful
[5:16] the Bible's telling us she's full of
[5:18] fornications and she's full of this but
[5:20] yet John when he sees her he wonders at
[5:23] her and she's a Marvel and he's gazing
[5:24] at her of her power and all the things
[5:27] that she has and so just by looking at
[5:29] it maybe you couldn't tell the
[5:30] difference but the Bible says within is
[5:33] death and what it carries and what it
[5:35] has is deadly so despite the fact that
[5:38] the scripture describes them in ways
[5:40] that they're complete opposites in the
[5:42] last days that mimikwed the terror will
[5:44] grow to a place that at a certain point
[5:46] it's going to look just like the wheat
[5:49] but it's deadly
[5:51] so as we mentioned in at the very start
[5:53] how the Devils lie and the devil's
[5:56] Mysteries rolls up against the truth of
[5:57] God and the mysteries of God in that
[5:59] City the devil's life produces the
[6:01] devil's many Mysteries
[6:03] so it's the devil's lies that produce
[6:05] Mysteries and so if you just have an
[6:07] appetite for Mysteries the devil can
[6:08] satisfy that
[6:10] and so the devil's life produces his
[6:12] many different Mysteries and it's that
[6:15] Antichrist Spirit working against the
[6:17] truth it's the and what we're looking at
[6:19] is the devil's method of operation this
[6:22] is the devil's tactic and how he uses
[6:23] lies to create Mysteries and it's always
[6:26] by lies It's Always by deception and so
[6:28] in that City it's the devil's lies and
[6:31] the devil the devil's lie and the
[6:33] devil's Mysteries that rise up against
[6:35] the truth of God and the mysteries of
[6:37] God
[6:38] if you look at Genesis chapter 3 verse 4
[6:41] I think I'll read this for you then come
[6:42] to verse 5. as we look at the serpent in
[6:45] the beginning and this is now Satan uh
[6:48] motivating and animating The Serpent and
[6:51] it says the serpent said unto the woman
[6:52] I know I'm jumping into the middle of
[6:54] the conversation but you can go read the
[6:55] tweets later he says you shall not
[6:58] surely die
[7:00] and that we know that's an absolute lie
[7:03] that the the devil's saying you shall
[7:05] not surely die and this seems to be some
[7:07] inspiration there seems to be some take
[7:09] this is his interpretation of the
[7:11] promise and it's here that we could
[7:13] begin to recognize the principle that
[7:15] where there seems to be an offer of
[7:18] inspiration or explanation or truth that
[7:22] what we do as Believers is we bring it
[7:23] back to the word
[7:25] and we find somebody said well if the
[7:27] Satan says that you shall surely die
[7:29] then you could bring it back to the
[7:30] truth and say well that's exactly what
[7:32] God Said So I'm not believing it because
[7:34] you said it but I can take it back to
[7:37] the word
[7:38] and so if we look at it this way I was
[7:41] asking myself this past week you know
[7:43] what's what makes a lie
[7:45] and 99 of Allah's composition can be
[7:49] things that are true
[7:51] we can say 99.9 perhaps but 99 of a lies
[7:55] composition in other words what makes up
[7:58] a lie 99 of it can be things that are
[8:00] true
[8:02] true facts uh verifiable you know uh you
[8:06] know supported by evidence and Witnesses
[8:08] and there can be a lot of things that
[8:09] add up and say well this is so a lie can
[8:13] contain things that are uh 90 of it can
[8:16] be things that are true and I'll even uh
[8:19] offer this that the truth can be used in
[8:22] such a way to deceive
[8:24] where we speak the truth but yet we
[8:26] frame it in a way we we use it in a way
[8:28] that is intending to uh to mislead so
[8:33] something true but used to lead you away
[8:35] from truth is still a lie
[8:38] you take you take something that's true
[8:39] and you and you use it in such a way to
[8:41] you're trying to deceive and so you're
[8:43] maybe you're you're running off to go uh
[8:45] meet your buddy for dinner and your wife
[8:48] calls you and says what time are you
[8:49] gonna be home for dinner so I'm not sure
[8:50] yet and she says well what are you doing
[8:51] he says I'm just driving by Home Depot
[8:54] real quick
[8:55] hey and you are
[8:56] you're going by Home Depot real quick
[8:58] and and you use the truth in a way to
[9:02] try to mislead your wife into thinking
[9:05] that you're not having a hot wings
[9:07] somewhere and filling your belly up
[9:09] before you get home and say I'm not
[9:10] really that hungry and you have to force
[9:11] yourself to eat and this has never
[9:12] happened to me thank God
[9:14] but the discernment is working tonight
[9:16] you Brothers you better watch out but
[9:18] it's it's using it's using something
[9:20] that's true
[9:21] in a way to mislead somebody from what
[9:24] you're actually doing so facts and
[9:27] figures and statistics and Science and
[9:29] things that may be true can still be
[9:32] lies in themselves if the motive of it
[9:35] is to take you away from truth
[9:37] so when this when Satan says you shall
[9:39] not surely die
[9:41] uh we kind of break that down to say
[9:43] it's just one word three letters not is
[9:45] what makes it a line
[9:47] look at the next part though in verse
[9:49] five for God doth know that in the day
[9:52] you eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[9:54] opened you shall be shall be his Gods
[9:57] knowing Good and Evil
[9:59] now he continues he says you shall not
[10:01] surely die and he continues to express
[10:02] himself and give his interpretation and
[10:05] in verse 7 after they eat the very words
[10:08] of the scripture says the eyes of them
[10:09] both were opened and they knew
[10:12] so the devil's lie was oh you shall not
[10:15] surely die for God doth know that the
[10:17] day you eat thereof then your eyes shall
[10:19] be opened you shall be as God's knowing
[10:22] and then when they do it the very thing
[10:25] that he said what happens happened their
[10:27] eyes are open and they both knew then in
[10:29] Genesis 3 22 the Lord God said behold
[10:32] the man has become as one of us to know
[10:35] good and evil
[10:37] so the devil's lie produced exactly what
[10:41] he said it would
[10:42] he said that you shall not surely die
[10:45] but God knows when you eat your eyes
[10:48] will be opened you'll become as God's
[10:49] knowing good and evil and the Bible says
[10:51] yeah as soon as they open their eyes
[10:52] were opened and they knew good and evil
[10:55] and God says they become as one of us so
[10:57] this is the devil's lie then is settings
[11:00] for things
[11:01] and expressing things that are akin to
[11:05] truth
[11:08] I know this is um
[11:10] I don't think it's treacherous what I'm
[11:12] doing but brother Bram does say teaching
[11:13] can be treacherous and so I realize
[11:15] these things we have to focus very
[11:17] intently tonight on this
[11:19] Satan took God's truth
[11:22] and perverted it ever so slightly
[11:26] and if you read verse 22 and you compare
[11:30] it to what the devil has already said it
[11:31] would appear as if God's quoting the
[11:33] serpent
[11:35] and it would appear as if he is
[11:36] affirming the devil's inspiration or
[11:38] that he is the devil says oh no God
[11:40] knows that when you eat your eyes will
[11:42] be opened you'll become like him and and
[11:45] you will know good from Evil and so when
[11:47] God says behold the man has become a God
[11:49] and his eyes are open to no good and
[11:50] even said well that's what the serpent
[11:51] said
[11:53] and there's a it would seem like this is
[11:56] part of the devil's inspiration yet what
[11:59] the devil said was true
[12:01] and what God Said was true
[12:04] but there's a difference and I'm not
[12:06] just talking about semantics or how you
[12:08] spell it and I think that this is an
[12:10] important one but I don't think we
[12:12] should get lost in it and all of a
[12:13] sudden Arizona Believers Church becomes
[12:14] the the Church of the truth and everyone
[12:16] else is the Church of the true and and
[12:18] somehow we've got to get our language
[12:20] just in there where we get the right but
[12:22] there is a difference between something
[12:25] being true and the truth
[12:28] and if it would help you capitalize the
[12:30] truth
[12:31] if that would help you just capitalize
[12:33] the truth let me give you an example
[12:35] with respect to water baptism in Matthew
[12:37] 28 19 it says go you into all the world
[12:39] baptize in them in the name of the
[12:40] father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
[12:42] that's true
[12:45] that's what Jesus said it's what he
[12:47] asked him to do that's true but the
[12:48] truth of it in Acts 2 38 is go into the
[12:51] one baptizing them in the name of the
[12:53] Lord Jesus
[12:54] that's the truth of Matthew 28 19. so
[12:58] Matthew 28 19 is true
[13:00] they have the rev the understanding of
[13:02] it is in baptize the name of Lord Jesus
[13:05] Christ
[13:06] so we we can look at it and recognize
[13:08] that yes one is true but the truth of it
[13:11] was greater than what was true
[13:14] and so the truth is not just something
[13:16] true the truth is deeper
[13:20] the the Devil May the Devil May repeat
[13:22] something and it may be true
[13:24] but the truth of it is going to be
[13:26] deeper maybe things that could be
[13:28] presented in a way to express a uh this
[13:31] is true and we think oh that's the truth
[13:33] but the truth isn't always just what's
[13:34] on the in the letter it's just not
[13:36] what's there on the face of it it's not
[13:38] just what's there in the black and white
[13:39] but there's some Revelation to it that
[13:42] makes it the truth
[13:44] now I know that there we heard the
[13:46] example of reading between the lines
[13:48] and what I found a lot of people use
[13:50] that quote to mean that they're
[13:52] interpreting the white space
[13:55] and if you look at it long enough you'll
[13:57] see things that brother Branham said
[13:58] between the lines it's like no to read
[14:01] between the lines is to know what's in
[14:04] the lines
[14:05] when something is said and you're
[14:07] reading between the lines it means
[14:08] you're catching the thought and the
[14:10] truth of what's being said and and maybe
[14:13] not just the letter of it but what the
[14:15] meaning was behind it
[14:17] and we could go even into the original
[14:19] sin we could say the original sin was
[14:21] Disobedience by partaking of a forbidden
[14:22] fruit and that's true
[14:26] but we know the truth is deeper
[14:29] there there's uh there's a depth that
[14:32] someone can have oh this is true and we
[14:34] could accept it as true but the truth is
[14:37] what you want
[14:39] and I know that may just seem to be uh
[14:41] semantics but hopefully we can just
[14:44] make that makes more sense tonight as we
[14:46] go forward
[14:47] so the devil's lie
[14:50] can be 99 things that are true
[14:54] but it was the one percent that caused
[14:56] death
[14:57] the devil's lie can be 99 of things that
[15:00] are true and not be the truth
[15:05] now in second Thessalonians chapter 2
[15:07] and we'll read to verse um we'll start
[15:09] with verse 10 and read to verse 13 but
[15:11] as you read as you look at that whole
[15:14] reading in from verses three to nine
[15:16] he's talking about power signs and lying
[15:18] wonders of the wicked of the Antichrist
[15:19] and how it's going to deceive and this
[15:21] is where he's using all deceivableness
[15:24] of unrighteousness
[15:26] in them that perish
[15:28] because they received not the love of
[15:31] the truth
[15:33] unrighteousness is righteousness
[15:34] perverted there may be some elements of
[15:37] the unrighteousness that too the one
[15:39] who's perishing or the one that's
[15:41] deceived thinks that it's righteousness
[15:44] there's enough there's enough in the
[15:46] elements to where they're not just
[15:47] wholesale uh swallowing Satan remember
[15:49] in using the devil voice that we think
[15:52] he sounds like versus the voice that he
[15:53] probably has you realize that the one
[15:55] we're falling for and the one that we're
[15:57] tempted by isn't the one that has the
[15:59] Deep grovelry demonic voice
[16:03] since they received they perish because
[16:05] they received not the love of the truth
[16:07] that they might be saved so salvation is
[16:09] in loving truth
[16:12] and it says and for this cause God shall
[16:14] send them strong delusion that they
[16:16] should believe a lie
[16:19] a light not just lies but they're going
[16:21] to believe a lie they're going to
[16:24] believe the devil's lie against the
[16:26] truth of God
[16:28] and in believing that lie they they all
[16:31] might be damned who believed not the
[16:34] truth but had pleasure in
[16:36] unrighteousness there's that enjoyment
[16:38] of and this is even a religious
[16:39] wickedness they enjoy the
[16:41] unrighteousness
[16:42] thinking to themselves that they are in
[16:45] righteousness that they're right he says
[16:48] he sits in the temple of God and being
[16:49] worshiped as God so those that are being
[16:52] deceived in unrighteousness they're not
[16:54] in the temple of Satan they believe that
[16:56] they're worshiping the one who's in the
[16:57] temple of God and being worshiped as God
[16:59] even to the point where the capital G is
[17:01] being used here in second Thessalonians
[17:03] 2.
[17:04] and then Paul switches but we are bound
[17:07] to give thanks all way to God for you
[17:09] brother and beloved of the Lord
[17:10] because God hath from the beginning what
[17:12] a contrast from those who are deceived
[17:15] into unrighteousness who receive not the
[17:16] love of the truth so they perish God
[17:18] sends strong delusion that they're going
[17:20] to believe a lie they're all going to be
[17:21] damned but then there's salvation for
[17:24] others and he says God chose you to this
[17:26] salvation
[17:28] through sanctification of the spirit and
[17:30] belief of the truth
[17:33] now as God says that the strong delusion
[17:36] will cause them to believe a lie the LIE
[17:39] may be 99 true
[17:42] but the one percent is what keeps it
[17:44] from being truth I'm going to keep
[17:45] repeating myself because I think it's
[17:47] all going to click here in a little bit
[17:48] a lie the LIE can be 99 true
[17:53] but it's the part that's missing that's
[17:55] misinterpreted or that's the
[17:56] contradiction that keeps it from being
[17:58] truth
[18:00] so even though it might be 99 true if
[18:04] there's anything in it that contradicts
[18:07] that's what makes it a lie
[18:10] the LIE is in the contradiction
[18:12] John chapter 8 verse 44 he says you are
[18:14] of your father the devil in the lust of
[18:17] your father ye will do he was a murderer
[18:19] from the beginning
[18:21] and Abode not in the truth
[18:24] because there is no truth in him
[18:27] that's a remarkable statement if we take
[18:29] it all the way back to Lucifer we take
[18:30] it back to Satan he cannot abide in
[18:33] truth there is no truth in him so he can
[18:36] he can speak things and he can say
[18:38] things but he's not a source of Truth
[18:40] remember a lie can only exist in the
[18:43] context of Truth you only have a lie
[18:45] because there's something that it
[18:46] opposes there's something that it
[18:48] changes so there is no truth in him when
[18:50] he speaketh the LIE he speaketh of his
[18:52] own for he is a liar and the father of
[18:55] it this is the image of Satan in the
[18:58] very beginning he is a murderer he is a
[19:00] speaker of lies he's the father of lies
[19:02] he's the father of murder and he is a
[19:04] murderer of Truth
[19:06] something that he opposes something that
[19:08] he's against
[19:09] and he will use things that are true to
[19:12] try and deceive
[19:14] it says that he's a father of lies and
[19:16] when he speaketh he speaketh the LIE
[19:18] it's he speaks in a way to where there's
[19:22] enough there that even as he spoke in
[19:24] Genesis 3 to where he says well God said
[19:26] that this would happen and God said that
[19:28] would happen he said well this is really
[19:30] what's going to happen and he says
[19:32] enough and I hope you recognize his
[19:34] pattern there in Genesis 3 he says
[19:35] enough to where you can say oh well
[19:37] who's speaking
[19:39] which one is it how was he lying when he
[19:42] said that you'd become like Gods because
[19:43] then God says that's exactly what
[19:45] happened he realized he has a way of
[19:47] even using things that are true in such
[19:49] a way to cause you to be deceived
[19:54] in John chapter 18
[19:59] these are just a lot of little pieces
[20:01] I'm putting out there
[20:03] uh and I'm hoping to start connecting
[20:05] things here in just a little bit
[20:06] John chapter 18 verses 33 to 38
[20:10] looking at this to see what truth is not
[20:12] just something that is true
[20:15] but what truth is
[20:17] and remember Satan's this he's a murder
[20:18] he's of a murderous spirit
[20:20] and he abides not in truth and there is
[20:22] no truth in him but let's find where
[20:24] truth is
[20:25] and pilate entered into the Judgment
[20:27] Hall again and called Jesus and said
[20:29] unto him art thou the king of the Jews
[20:31] may want to use this scripture for some
[20:32] time and we'll read something and we'll
[20:33] move on past it but we'll come back to
[20:35] it hopefully later art thou the king of
[20:37] the Jews Jesus answered him says Thou
[20:41] this of thyself or did others tell it
[20:43] thee of me
[20:44] why are you asking
[20:46] is this something you want to know for
[20:47] yourself or did somebody else put you up
[20:49] to it
[20:50] oh my is that not the devil's Mo you
[20:53] know go and ask him yeah go and ask
[20:57] this isn't an honest question that
[20:58] originates from within the heart of
[21:00] someone who's seeking truth but rather
[21:01] something else kind of moving remember
[21:03] Judas going why would we waste this we
[21:05] could feed the poor for a year
[21:07] and he didn't ask because he loved the
[21:09] poor he asked because he held the bag
[21:11] right and he wanted to get access to
[21:13] that he there's Bitcoin was going up he
[21:15] wanted to invest
[21:16] and he wanted access to the money
[21:18] and so he this the question that is
[21:21] asked he says well is this from you are
[21:23] you wanting to know if I'm the king of
[21:25] the Jews to satisfy the desire for truth
[21:27] in your heart or did others tell it the
[21:30] of me
[21:31] are you have you been told he claims to
[21:34] be the king just did someone else tell
[21:35] you that he's the king of the Jews where
[21:36] where's the question arising pilate
[21:38] answered am I a Jew thy no nation and
[21:41] the chief of priests have delivered thee
[21:42] unto me and what hast thou done
[21:46] and there's the recognize that Jesus is
[21:49] now being brought through to before the
[21:51] political power
[21:52] and being asked he's being questioned he
[21:55] says what have you done Jesus answered
[21:57] my kingdom is not of this world
[22:01] if my kingdom were of this world then
[22:04] would my servants fight
[22:07] recognize the arena when he says my
[22:09] kingdom is not of this world and even
[22:10] how that may seem to be a contradiction
[22:12] when he began his whole first sermon
[22:14] began with repent the Kingdom of Heaven
[22:16] is at hand
[22:17] and he's saying well my kingdom is not
[22:19] of this world if it was my servants
[22:21] would then fight
[22:23] that I should not be delivered to the
[22:25] Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[22:27] hence
[22:28] there's a lot that he says there
[22:30] it's a lot we said that what he just
[22:32] said is truth
[22:34] and you can take things away from it
[22:36] that are true yet you could spin it in a
[22:38] way that you get further from the truth
[22:40] by using the very things that he said
[22:42] people have done that with go and
[22:43] baptize them in the name of the father
[22:45] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[22:46] they've taken things that are true and
[22:47] got further from the word
[22:49] used it as a step stool to step right
[22:52] out of scripture because they hold to
[22:54] the letter of it and resist the truth of
[22:56] it
[22:58] Jesus says my kingdom is not of this
[23:00] world it's it's not in this Arena it's
[23:02] not at this time it's not for these
[23:03] things if this is where my kingdom was
[23:06] being projected right now if my kingdom
[23:09] was about drawing swords and keeping me
[23:11] from being crucified trust me you
[23:13] wouldn't have a chance
[23:14] he's even said the only reason why
[23:16] you're able to deliver me up for
[23:17] crucifixion is you've received this
[23:18] power from my father you have no power
[23:20] except to be given to you of my father
[23:22] pilate therefore and therefore said unto
[23:25] him are thou a kingdom
[23:28] Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a
[23:31] king to this end was I born and for this
[23:34] cause came I into the world that I
[23:36] should bear witness of the truth
[23:39] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[23:43] voice
[23:45] this zeros it in on understanding what
[23:48] the truth is and the faith is
[23:50] it says everyone that is of the truth
[23:52] heareth my voice and he should bear
[23:55] witness of the truth there's a lot of
[23:57] things that are true that collectively
[23:58] are part of the truth broken down into
[24:00] their little individual Concepts people
[24:02] can just cherry pick and have a lot of
[24:05] true things in their bag and their
[24:06] Theology and their Doctrine and their
[24:08] belief and you begin to look at oh
[24:09] what's this scripture what's this it's
[24:11] that and you see a lot of things in it
[24:12] but he's saying no this isn't just
[24:14] things that are true he says I am the
[24:17] truth
[24:19] pilate saith in him what is truth
[24:23] there's the question what is truth
[24:26] and it immediately turns around and we
[24:28] had said this he went out again unto the
[24:31] Jews and saith unto them I find in him
[24:33] no fault at all
[24:35] he answered his question
[24:38] Jesus says that I come to Bear witness
[24:40] of the truth and everyone that is of the
[24:42] truth heareth my voice the question is
[24:44] what is truth and pilate immediately
[24:46] answers it and says in him there is no
[24:48] fault
[24:49] there is no air though there may seem to
[24:51] be some contradiction and though it may
[24:52] seem to be against the law in this way
[24:54] and though it may not may not be in the
[24:56] way that we might have expected it in
[24:58] him there is no fault and that's what
[24:59] makes him truth
[25:02] there's no fault in the truth we know
[25:04] there's only one who is the truth and
[25:06] that is Jesus Christ he said I am the
[25:08] way the truth and the life
[25:10] Paul writing said let God be true but
[25:13] every man a liar
[25:16] that's remarkable
[25:18] this is why you bring things back to the
[25:21] word
[25:22] Paul even himself is saying let God be
[25:24] true but every man a liar in other words
[25:25] if you can't take what a man says back
[25:28] to the word
[25:31] then there's this well
[25:33] what is it
[25:35] because he says let God be true but
[25:37] every man a liar
[25:39] and if you look at it how Jesus was
[25:42] being accused and Jesus is being
[25:44] attacked
[25:45] he was accused of breaking the law
[25:48] healing on the Sabbath day in violation
[25:49] of the law
[25:51] accused of threatening to tear down the
[25:53] temple accused a blasphemy and all the
[25:56] different things that he was accused of
[25:58] and if you looked at the law in their
[26:00] interpretation of the law he would be
[26:02] guilty of breaking the law according to
[26:04] the man
[26:06] but he only violated their carnal
[26:08] interpretation of the law
[26:11] as Jesus said in Matthew 23 23 woe unto
[26:14] you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[26:17] you paid tithes of mint and Anderson
[26:19] cumin and have omitted the weightier
[26:21] matters of the law judgment mercy and
[26:24] faith
[26:24] these ought you to have done and not to
[26:28] leave the other undone
[26:30] these things are true but you've missed
[26:33] the truth of it
[26:34] you've done these things of pain tithe
[26:37] and careful about this and strict about
[26:39] that but yet when it came down to it
[26:40] you've missed the way to your matters
[26:42] the deeper substance what's holding it
[26:44] all up at the end of the day of judgment
[26:46] mercy and Faith you shouldn't do these
[26:48] things but yet you've left the other
[26:50] undone therefore what they were doing
[26:52] was bringing them further away from God
[26:55] because the truth was deeper
[27:00] we could say it this way the devil's lie
[27:02] masquerades as the truth of God
[27:06] and as it dances around and masquerades
[27:08] as the truth of God is doing so by
[27:09] impersonation
[27:11] wants to cause confusion and it wants to
[27:13] impersonate you
[27:15] remember how that Satan was able to show
[27:17] Christ
[27:18] all the kingdoms of the world
[27:21] not just then existing but kingdoms of
[27:24] past and future
[27:26] so he had some conception of what had
[27:28] been he understood things as they
[27:30] presently were to a certain degree and
[27:32] could even project out
[27:34] the way that things would become
[27:37] are you listening
[27:39] Satan could Envision future kingdoms
[27:42] he could show Christ in a moment of time
[27:45] this is how things are going to look
[27:48] but the man said he knew the will of God
[27:50] and not maybe in a perfect sense but he
[27:52] has some figure he has something as Paul
[27:53] said we looked through a glass dark lid
[27:55] we see something there we see some image
[27:58] we can't make it all out in particular
[27:59] so Satan had seen enough in heaven seen
[28:02] enough unfolding at Earth to where he
[28:05] thought he knew what God was doing
[28:07] and so he could very quickly like a
[28:09] sketch artist try to begin to draw the
[28:12] picture of what he thought God was going
[28:14] to do
[28:15] so Satan is with the with the
[28:17] opportunity that he had as God gives him
[28:19] the time to do it he now wants to build
[28:22] a kingdom that looks like the kingdom
[28:25] that he thinks God's producing
[28:27] he was he had some concept of the plan
[28:30] of God and he could project out what he
[28:31] was building so he could so Jesus the
[28:33] kingdoms of the world and Jesus could
[28:35] acknowledge us this is what you're going
[28:36] to produce but Jesus knew there was
[28:38] another way that he would deal with
[28:40] those kingdoms or come into air of him
[28:44] as I said before I think I said it this
[28:46] way that Satan can use things that are
[28:47] true
[28:49] to describe things that are false
[28:53] use things use true things
[28:56] to describe a false thing
[28:58] to make the truth look wrong
[29:01] I'm just throwing some stuff out there
[29:02] for you guys to talk about at breakfast
[29:03] tomorrow
[29:06] these are these are things to consider
[29:09] Satan can use true things whether you
[29:12] want to say factual or scriptural or
[29:13] quotes and use different things and kind
[29:15] of put them up there and use them to
[29:18] describe something that's not truth
[29:21] and by doing so it makes the true look
[29:25] false
[29:27] it becomes a stain on what is truth
[29:29] because things that are true are going
[29:31] to comprise and the truth has truth the
[29:33] true things are part of the truth and
[29:35] these different things that make up
[29:36] Christ and make who he is when someone
[29:38] separates it out from Christ and misuses
[29:40] the name of Jesus Christ and misuses the
[29:42] message and misuses quotes and misuses
[29:44] all these things then there's this stain
[29:46] that's put on it so it's like well this
[29:48] collection of things that were presented
[29:49] to truth if put into a false image and
[29:52] what happens is The False Image now
[29:53] embodies what people say that's what
[29:56] they claim to be the truth
[29:57] and it's a straw man
[30:01] it's a lie
[30:02] have you heard the story about a lie
[30:05] with the truth clothes on
[30:07] I think if you heard brother John
[30:08] LaFontaine preach enough times you may
[30:10] have heard it first time I ever heard it
[30:12] was just a young boy and he told the
[30:14] story he told it in a way that was
[30:16] somehow truth and Eli were hanging out
[30:19] and the LIE convinced truth to go
[30:21] swimming and Truth took they took their
[30:23] clothes off and when truth jumped in the
[30:25] the lake
[30:26] the LIE put on the truth's clothes
[30:29] and so the lie went into town
[30:31] with true's clothes on
[30:33] and there's a there's some paintings
[30:35] that Express the image I don't look at
[30:38] them
[30:39] but there's this idea in philosophy and
[30:41] these ideas of
[30:43] with Plato and Democritus and different
[30:46] wines that say well what is truth it's
[30:47] in the abyss
[30:49] it's in the well it's been cast down in
[30:51] Noel so there's this depiction of Truth
[30:53] coming and rising up to the surface but
[30:55] since a lie has been walking around with
[30:57] the truth's clothes on people are afraid
[30:59] of the naked truth
[31:01] and that was I believe how brother John
[31:03] LaFontaine expressed it many decades ago
[31:06] that that the LIE dressed in the clothes
[31:10] of Truth
[31:12] and so it was using what was true to
[31:15] confuse what is truth
[31:18] just causing confusion
[31:19] masquerading is the truth and wearing
[31:21] the truth clothes and here's A
[31:23] well-dressed fully furnished lie but
[31:25] it's wearing the clothes that the truth
[31:27] wore and now people are more willing to
[31:29] accept a lie that's dressed up than they
[31:32] are the naked truth
[31:38] okay I hope you're with me to this point
[31:41] maybe said enough about the devil's lie
[31:43] and how he's using truth confusing the
[31:45] record we use elements of Truth to paint
[31:48] a picture that's false
[31:50] and it's painted in such a way to where
[31:52] it may contain enough elements of the
[31:54] Right image
[31:56] that we could just as easily reject the
[31:58] Right image based upon the false
[32:01] am I comparing them would say wow the
[32:03] Bible says this about righteousness
[32:06] and the devil says yeah it does say that
[32:07] about righteousness and it does say this
[32:09] about righteousness it says this about
[32:10] this and this about this begins to paint
[32:11] this picture over here and after a while
[32:13] you think oh well that's the picture
[32:15] that's being painted using all those
[32:16] truisms
[32:18] and you reject it
[32:20] because of the false and then the true
[32:22] you're unable to recognize it because
[32:25] you couldn't discern the LIE
[32:32] let's go through this quickly I want to
[32:34] just I don't want to get into the
[32:36] context of these scriptures or even the
[32:37] truth I don't even want to begin to
[32:39] express the truth of them I just want to
[32:41] say they're true and just look at the
[32:44] letter of it in Psalm 75 verse 8.
[32:47] we're kind of stepping forward all those
[32:49] little bits and pieces there are
[32:52] tools I hope that you can use to piece
[32:54] together what we're what we're going to
[32:56] be ending on Psalm 75 verse 8 for in the
[32:58] hand of the Lord there is a cup
[33:01] and the wine is red
[33:04] it is full of mixture and you poureth
[33:06] out the same but the dreads thereof all
[33:08] the wicked of the Earth shall ring them
[33:10] out and drink them okay there's a lot
[33:12] there
[33:13] but the Lord is depicted as having a cup
[33:15] full of red wine
[33:17] here he is holding this cup that's the
[33:20] Lord
[33:21] then in Revelation 17 the Harlot of
[33:23] mystery Babylon has a golden cup in her
[33:25] hand with the wine of her fornication
[33:28] and all the kings of the Earth are drunk
[33:31] on the wine that's in the cup
[33:33] so this mystery Babylon is holding a cup
[33:36] full of wine and now we see a very image
[33:38] of God who himself is holding a cup of
[33:40] wine
[33:41] Revelations 18 verse 16 saying alas it's
[33:44] about Babylon the great Harlot mystery
[33:46] Babylon alas alas that great City
[33:49] that was clothed in fine linen and
[33:52] purple I had a lot of had some
[33:53] scriptures to show it I think it's in
[33:54] John 19 that Christ is robed and purple
[33:58] it's a sign of royalty clothed and fine
[34:01] linen and purple and Scarlet and decked
[34:03] with gold and precious stones and pearls
[34:06] and this is being spoken of the great
[34:10] this is Mystery Babylon yet she is
[34:12] arrayed in a clothing fine linen and
[34:15] purple Scarlet decked with gold and
[34:16] precious stones and Pearls that's an
[34:18] image get in Revelations 19 verse 8 and
[34:21] to her speaking of the Bride the Lamb's
[34:23] wife to her was granted
[34:25] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[34:28] clean and white for the fine linen is
[34:30] the righteousness of the Saints
[34:33] recognize how that certain elements are
[34:35] true of mystery Babylon
[34:37] and true of the Bride that are
[34:40] completely different things
[34:41] and if one was just looking for fine
[34:43] linen and decked with gold and precious
[34:46] stones and Pearls they might look and
[34:48] see that and say oh the New Jerusalem in
[34:50] Revelations 21 is garnished with
[34:52] precious stones with Gates of pearls and
[34:54] streets of gold
[34:57] as the scripture describes it Revelation
[34:59] 17 and Revelations 18 it's kind of
[35:01] letting us see what it really is
[35:03] but how could it present itself if it
[35:05] seems to have all the same elements
[35:09] Revelation 6 verse 2 and I saw him
[35:11] Behold a white horse and he that sat on
[35:13] him had a bow and a crown was given unto
[35:16] him
[35:20] and he went forth conquering and to
[35:21] conquer
[35:23] here a white horse one sitting on him
[35:26] has a bow
[35:28] He Goes Forth conquering and to conquer
[35:30] he was given a crown in Revelations 12
[35:32] the red dragon has seven crowns in
[35:34] Revelations 13 a beast with ten crowns
[35:38] so these crowns upon the head of the
[35:39] white horse in Revelation 6 2 upon the
[35:42] red dragon in Revelations 12 and upon
[35:44] the Beast with ten horns in Revelations
[35:46] 13 but then in Revelations 19 11 12 and
[35:48] 13 and I saw heaven open and behold a
[35:51] white horse
[35:52] there's one that comes right in on a
[35:54] white horse conquering out and biting
[35:55] and conquering and he that set upon him
[35:57] in this one now another white horse in
[35:59] Revelations 19 and listen a lot of
[36:01] theologians say there is Christ in
[36:03] Revelation 6. here he is a good
[36:04] Revelations 19. Behold a white horse and
[36:07] he that sat upon him was called faithful
[36:09] and true and in righteousness he doth
[36:11] judge and make war his eyes were as a
[36:14] flame of fire and on his head were many
[36:15] crowns
[36:17] and he had a name written that no man
[36:19] knew but he himself and he was clothed
[36:21] with the vesture dipped in Blood and his
[36:23] name is called
[36:24] the word of God
[36:29] this is just a snippet
[36:32] the scriptures that we could begin to
[36:33] line up that describe one thing
[36:36] and then we can use them to begin to
[36:37] describe another
[36:40] there's elements that we can begin to
[36:41] describe about Babylonian religion and
[36:43] then you might find yourself finding out
[36:45] that oh those same elements exist within
[36:46] True Religion
[36:48] you might take things that you lift up
[36:50] as being well this is what this is but
[36:52] then you find out will it exist over
[36:53] here
[36:54] and if I'm making you uncomfortable at
[36:57] all
[36:57] in making you feel as if there's no
[36:59] Paradigm on earth that is of a human
[37:02] creation or some system that a man uses
[37:04] that can conclusively prove the truth
[37:08] then I've got you where you need to be
[37:11] because God wants you to know him by
[37:13] faith
[37:15] and not through some system
[37:18] that placates
[37:20] Your Lust for knowledge and satisfies
[37:22] all your Curiosities or just wets your
[37:25] appetite for Mysteries
[37:27] something that's real
[37:30] I was thinking today that Phoenix has
[37:32] gotten so hot that cognitive dissonance
[37:35] doesn't even work anymore
[37:41] and that's how we ought to come to truth
[37:46] these are different elements that on one
[37:48] hand describe things that are related to
[37:51] the Antichrist the mystery Babylon
[37:54] things that are wicked things that are
[37:55] impure and yet we could outline
[37:58] one standing with the cup in their hand
[38:02] and you say oh
[38:03] that's mystery Babylon but it's the Lord
[38:06] pouring out judgments
[38:07] oh there's one who's described with
[38:10] having pearls and gold and and fine
[38:12] linen and say oh that's mystery Babylon
[38:15] but yet it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:19] I I know there's a the way I'm putting
[38:22] it maybe leaves a lot to be desired but
[38:23] I'm just wanting to stimulate some
[38:25] thought
[38:26] and how that things are presented
[38:29] one could take certain elements of
[38:31] scripture piece them together to paint a
[38:33] picture and say oh well this looks good
[38:34] and that looks good and this looks good
[38:36] and that looks good then if someone else
[38:38] could kind of piece things together here
[38:39] all this looks good that looks good but
[38:40] you know what takes the light of God's
[38:42] word to expose the contradiction between
[38:44] the devil's lie and the truth of God
[38:47] it takes the light of God's word and
[38:49] it's not just light that is shining
[38:51] globally and ecclesiastically in a light
[38:53] that's showing within the church and and
[38:56] as soon as we walk in we're like oh look
[38:57] this is this is happening no it's the
[38:59] light that's got to shine into your
[39:00] heart
[39:01] it's a light that has to shine for you
[39:03] into the word of God on one hand we have
[39:06] mystery Babylon on the other hand we
[39:07] have the New Jerusalem on one hand we
[39:09] have the Antichrist on the other hand we
[39:10] have Christ and yet they can the false
[39:13] Christ and false Apostles in this one of
[39:15] second Thessalonians 2 presents himself
[39:17] in such a way to where people think
[39:19] they're worshiping God but they're
[39:20] actually worshiping Satan we start
[39:22] thinking oh no well then how am I going
[39:23] to get it right
[39:26] but notice in Revelation 17 verse 1 and
[39:28] there came one of the Seven Angels which
[39:30] had the seven vials and talked with me
[39:32] saying unto me come hither
[39:36] I will show unto thee the Judgment of
[39:39] the great
[39:40] that sitteth upon many Waters
[39:43] and the word begins to describe that
[39:45] this woman who appears to be so
[39:46] beautiful and though she may have
[39:48] scarlet and be decked with Golds and
[39:49] pearls and dressed in fine linen this is
[39:52] a false representation this is Satan's
[39:54] bride this is something different and in
[39:57] the wrong kind of light you could think
[39:59] that's God's Mighty church and the wrong
[40:01] kind of light you could think the
[40:03] Antichrist is Christ in the wrong kind
[40:05] of life but yet there's a voice that
[40:07] comes it says it's a one of the Seven
[40:08] Angels which has the seven vials he says
[40:11] come I'll show the Judgment of the great
[40:13] that sitteth upon many Waters
[40:16] there's a lot we can begin to read in
[40:17] that but there's a voice that comes and
[40:20] exposes who that woman is
[40:24] then look in Revelations 21 verse 9 and
[40:27] there came unto me one of the seven
[40:28] angels that had the seven vials full of
[40:30] the seven last plagues and talked with
[40:31] me saying
[40:32] recognize the continuity there's a voice
[40:35] that exposes who mystery Babylon is to
[40:38] that who that woman is and he says come
[40:40] hither I will show Thee the bride the
[40:43] Lamb's wife
[40:45] so the same one who exposes mystery
[40:48] Babylon is the same one that shows
[40:51] Revelations 21 and it has that symmetry
[40:54] because Revelation 17 directly opposes
[40:57] the image of Revelation 21.
[41:01] they both share these similar
[41:02] descriptions
[41:04] the the cemetery and the language and
[41:06] the things that are used in the image
[41:09] the outward appearance not what's Inward
[41:10] and the Judgment of it but you got to
[41:13] look at what was being portrayed and
[41:14] expressed without the judgment
[41:16] the same message that exposes
[41:19] the Harlot brings forth the bride
[41:22] the same message says look at mystery
[41:24] Babylon look at denominationalism look
[41:26] at the mark of the beast look at
[41:27] everything that's wrong look at The
[41:28] Heirs look at these things the same
[41:30] thing that exposes and gives the
[41:32] Judgment of the false systems introduces
[41:34] you to the true
[41:37] in other words it just doesn't sit back
[41:39] and tear everything down
[41:40] take pot shots everything is wrong there
[41:42] is no truth nobody's right but it brings
[41:44] you to truth
[41:46] and the voice that is exposing
[41:49] the air corrects the air
[41:52] it'll it'll take things and say well
[41:55] fine linen isn't for mystery Babylon
[41:57] it's for the bride
[41:59] pearls aren't to be used that way it's
[42:01] for the gates it's the streets of gold
[42:04] that's it and it's taking things and it
[42:06] places the devil doesn't have the
[42:08] Monopoly on the pearls didn't have a
[42:10] monopoly on the gold he doesn't have a
[42:11] monopoly on the fine linen he misuses it
[42:15] but there's a message that comes and
[42:16] takes things that have been misused and
[42:18] things that were true throughout the
[42:20] ages and all these things that were kind
[42:22] of loose ends and we're used to present
[42:23] wrong kind of images and support
[42:25] denominationalism and build kingdoms and
[42:27] God comes back and says I'm taking this
[42:29] back I'm taking that back and you've got
[42:31] to be careful that when God takes back
[42:33] the truth that you don't associate it to
[42:35] the ones who held it and bonded say oh
[42:37] well we don't want that because that was
[42:38] part of this
[42:39] oh we don't want that that was that was
[42:41] part of that Lord so you tell me you
[42:44] don't want justification anymore
[42:45] that's Luther's message we don't want it
[42:47] right surely we don't want justification
[42:52] we want it
[42:54] we want all truth we we want we want the
[42:56] truth is accumulated up we want these
[42:58] things that have advanced we want the
[42:59] Revelation what they had in measure we
[43:01] want in fullness what they hadn't over
[43:03] here with a little bit of understanding
[43:05] we want the full understanding of it
[43:10] truth of God it's the way the truth the
[43:13] life
[43:14] it exposes the LIE the devil's lie
[43:17] it exposes
[43:19] the counterfeit prophets who imitate the
[43:21] truth
[43:23] it exposes those who were using the
[43:25] language of scripture to present a
[43:27] picture and using this and using that
[43:28] and painted it and God comes with the
[43:31] voice that says we'll take that we'll
[43:33] take that and we'll show you where it's
[43:35] in the truth and if it helps you to
[43:37] understand that maybe says no see that's
[43:39] all false representations this is the
[43:41] truth
[43:42] and brings you to the comparison
[43:46] as Jesus says and you shall know the
[43:48] truth
[43:49] and the truth shall make
[43:51] you free
[43:53] oh how important the truth is
[43:55] this is the these are the mechanics of
[43:57] light I was going to get into a lot of
[43:58] the things that brother Brown says about
[44:00] light
[44:01] whatsoever death make manifest as light
[44:05] as long as there's enough fog and mist
[44:07] and confusion and distractions
[44:10] an image can be projected to where you
[44:12] can't quite figure out what it is and
[44:14] you can just fill in the blanks yourself
[44:15] and think that's the church
[44:18] that's truth this is what the Bible says
[44:21] about this but you're interpreting it
[44:23] through the Mist
[44:25] but then the light comes and gives the
[44:28] full picture
[44:29] and so the devil hates light
[44:34] and as the Devils lie pretends to be the
[44:38] truth
[44:39] it likes to masquerade as the truth it's
[44:42] very quick to call the truth a lie
[44:45] very quick to tear down the correct
[44:48] image and oppose it because it needs to
[44:51] save face as the truth
[44:53] with the naked truth shows I was like no
[44:55] no these are my clothes
[44:57] the truth says no he took it from me
[44:59] stole it from me those are mine oh no no
[45:01] no buddy this is me I I'm the truth he
[45:04] got there first
[45:05] life seems to travel a lot faster than
[45:07] the truth
[45:09] we used to joke around a little bit and
[45:11] certain times that if we ever wanted to
[45:12] get the news out we knew just the right
[45:14] people to share it with
[45:16] because you know everybody would find
[45:18] out
[45:19] because there's just some way those
[45:20] things travel
[45:22] I recognize how this works in Luke
[45:24] Chapter 23. this is a very important
[45:26] kind of COG that I just want to touch on
[45:28] very quick and then close
[45:31] in Luke chapter 23
[45:34] verses 8 to 12.
[45:36] let's recognize that Pilate
[45:40] of the affiliation of Roman power
[45:42] political power and Herod who would be
[45:44] the the rightful ruler in a religious
[45:47] sense to the Jews
[45:50] and how that even in the image of the
[45:52] pergamian mixture and the thoroughly
[45:53] married that there is how the religious
[45:56] Kingdom of that day and the political
[45:58] Kingdom of that day Mary and unite
[46:01] themselves
[46:02] in what it takes to bring them together
[46:05] and when Herod saw Jesus
[46:08] he was exceeding glad for he was
[46:10] desirous to see him of a long season
[46:11] because he'd heard many things of him
[46:13] and he hoped to have seen some miracle
[46:15] done by him
[46:18] people can be excited to see
[46:20] but not for the same reasons that we are
[46:25] it says in verse 9 then he questioned
[46:27] him with many words but he answered him
[46:28] nothing
[46:30] and the chief priests and scribes are
[46:31] not satisfied with the what they get out
[46:33] of him he won't clown for him he's not
[46:34] giving them the information they need
[46:36] and tickling their ears and the chief
[46:37] priests and scribes stood and vehemently
[46:39] accused him and Herod with his Men of
[46:42] War set him at naught and mocked him and
[46:46] arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and set
[46:48] sent him again to Pilate here's the
[46:52] truth
[46:53] here's the one that pilate's going to
[46:54] exclaim I find no fault in him
[46:57] that this is truth and this is one who's
[47:00] falsely accused and now herod's
[47:02] belittling him and mocking him and to
[47:03] raise him in a certain way and this
[47:05] mocking tone and the rearrangement of
[47:07] things and oh you're a king well let's
[47:09] just put this scripture on your head and
[47:10] let's just put a robe around you and you
[47:12] claim to be this and put all these
[47:14] things together and mocking him and
[47:16] setting him at not and when he sends
[47:18] them again to pilate notice how the
[47:21] Bible says the same day pilate and Herod
[47:24] were made friends together
[47:26] for before they were at enmity between
[47:28] themselves notice how quickly people who
[47:31] are Rivals will marry
[47:34] when they have a common hatred for truth
[47:38] that day political and religious could
[47:40] Unite
[47:41] not around truth but against truth under
[47:45] the pretense of Truth and things that
[47:47] were true and this is happening and
[47:49] that's happening and they were bitter
[47:51] enemies before and there was hatred but
[47:53] through the mockery of Truth through the
[47:56] opposition of Christ and being against
[47:58] and mocking and belittling as it said
[48:01] the enemy of my enemy is my friend now
[48:04] pilate and Herod had a reason to get
[48:06] together hang out in Fellowship because
[48:08] they found something they hated in
[48:10] common
[48:12] and that's how the devil's lies work
[48:17] they were uniting in gathering Darkness
[48:20] gathers against light
[48:24] John chapter 3 verse 19 it says and this
[48:26] is the condemnation that light has come
[48:28] into the world
[48:30] and Men loved Darkness rather than light
[48:33] because their deeds were evil
[48:36] when lightness when light comes it
[48:38] exposes the LIE
[48:40] whatever makes manifest is light when
[48:43] you turn on the light the darkness
[48:45] scurries it goes and hides in a corner
[48:47] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that
[48:49] brings forth truth it was the
[48:51] manifestation of Jesus Christ and that
[48:53] day that United pilate inherit it was
[48:54] the manifestation of the truth that
[48:56] caused the uh the high priest to lose
[48:59] his religion and rent his garments and
[49:01] all the the hatred and the Animus that
[49:03] was being expressed against Christ it
[49:05] was because the word was being revealed
[49:08] the Bible's saying that men hate the
[49:10] word not because they love the truth but
[49:12] because their deeds are evil
[49:14] they hate it because it's their their
[49:16] evil Deeds are exposed by the Light
[49:20] the Bible says in John 1 4 and 5 in him
[49:22] was life and the life was the light of
[49:24] men
[49:25] in light shineth and darkness in the
[49:28] darkness comprehended it not
[49:31] the darkness could not receive the light
[49:33] it's not in it to receive it cannot
[49:35] understand it can't learn it or perceive
[49:37] light it's can't grasp it it can't
[49:40] overcome it it can't oppose it it's
[49:42] the darkness gathers against light the
[49:45] darkness only exists in the absence of
[49:47] light
[49:48] Darkness realizes that it only it only
[49:51] has any meaning and only has any
[49:53] existence because of light so it hates
[49:54] light because the light is greater than
[49:56] it
[49:57] that's why the lie hates truth because
[49:59] the LIE doesn't exist on its own it's
[50:01] only a deformity it's only a perversion
[50:03] as soon as truth steps forward and
[50:04] declares itself the lie just Withers
[50:06] away it loses all power
[50:09] the Bible says in Matthew 4 16 and 17
[50:11] the people which sat in darkness saw
[50:12] great light and to them which sat in the
[50:14] region and Shadow death light is sprung
[50:16] up
[50:17] from that time Jesus began to preach and
[50:19] say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is
[50:21] at hand
[50:22] it was the Kingdom of Light
[50:26] the Fulfillment of scripture that the
[50:27] people which Saturn great in darkness
[50:29] light was springing up
[50:32] those who are in bondage to lie is in
[50:34] darkness the shadow of death they are
[50:35] hanging over him light had sprung up and
[50:38] Christ comes preaching the Kingdom of
[50:39] Heaven is at hand
[50:42] Paul says in second Corinthians 4
[50:45] just read three to four it says but if
[50:46] our gospel be hid it is hid to them that
[50:48] are lost
[50:50] and whom the God of this world
[50:52] hath blinded the minds of them which
[50:54] believed not now we could come back and
[50:56] look at how that those that believe not
[50:58] receive not a love of the truth that
[51:00] they might be saved but you are
[51:02] chosen from the beginning to Salvation
[51:04] through the belief of the truth so if
[51:05] there's anyone that's blinded and I love
[51:07] this Paul is basically saying oh if
[51:09] anybody doesn't believe my message it's
[51:11] because they're lost
[51:13] I mean that's what Paul is saying so if
[51:16] you don't like that attitude we just
[51:17] don't like Paul
[51:18] he says if our gospel is hid if people
[51:20] don't believe it and they can't receive
[51:22] it it's just those that are lost that
[51:23] can't receive it he says in whom the God
[51:25] of this world hath blinded the minds of
[51:28] them which believed not
[51:30] he blinds their minds and soul that the
[51:32] light of the Glorious gospel of Christ
[51:33] who is in the image of God will not
[51:35] shine to them
[51:37] the reason why their minds are blinded
[51:39] is speak and the reason why they do not
[51:40] believe and the reason why they do not
[51:42] receive the Gospel is because the Light
[51:44] of Christ and the light does not get to
[51:47] them
[51:48] it has not shined on them so the devil's
[51:51] lie is Darkness it's death it's
[51:53] perversion it's filth it's
[51:54] unrighteousness but yet Satan himself
[51:57] and his Messengers are transformed as
[51:59] angels of life but yet they're
[52:00] messengers of death
[52:02] masquerading is like masquerading is
[52:05] truth
[52:06] because they hate the truth
[52:09] now I've said a lot to say this in
[52:12] closing
[52:13] the word exposes the devil's lie
[52:16] a lie can be 99
[52:18] the things that are true
[52:21] contains things that are true up to 99
[52:23] we're just using that formula it's not
[52:25] strict
[52:28] but the word exposes the devil's lie
[52:33] by bringing out the truth
[52:37] the devil may say oh you know you
[52:39] baptize the name of the Father the Son
[52:40] and the Holy Ghost
[52:42] and we could say well that's true
[52:45] but the truth of it is in the name of
[52:46] the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:48] so I say well this is this is what
[52:50] happens and this is what happens again
[52:51] this is what happens this is what the
[52:52] Bible says this is what the Bible says
[52:53] well that's true but this is the truth
[52:56] you always got to bring it back to
[52:58] scripture
[52:59] the light of God's word the word the
[53:01] message of the hour exposes the devil's
[53:03] lie many times not by not in the way
[53:06] that we say a complete oh well there's
[53:07] no such thing as baptism which is what
[53:10] some people do go into all the world and
[53:12] baptize them in the name of the father
[53:13] son of Holy Ghost well that was just an
[53:14] old foggy idea that died out with the
[53:16] apostles
[53:17] but it brings out the deeper truth of it
[53:20] the word removes the word overthrows the
[53:24] LIE
[53:27] and
[53:28] it takes as the LIE is cast down
[53:33] it places what is true even if it had
[53:36] come before it places it
[53:39] I I you know this will make more sense
[53:42] maybe as we continue
[53:44] uh in in future services
[53:46] but there's this
[53:48] we can get uncomfortable sometimes
[53:55] when when things are set a certain way
[53:58] and I'm not going to say it I'm going to
[54:00] say it uncomfortably
[54:02] but there there's there's a there's a
[54:04] need sometimes to tear down what's false
[54:07] and when your kingdoms are destroyed and
[54:09] your Idols have been destroyed now
[54:11] listen to me when the word starts
[54:13] tearing down the idols in your heart
[54:15] it wants to build back a true image
[54:18] and there may be things he's building
[54:20] back that remind you of what's been torn
[54:23] down but those things made a lie God's
[54:27] wanting to build truth
[54:29] God and building his image in you is
[54:33] using truth
[54:35] to build righteousness instead of the
[54:38] devil misusing things that are true to
[54:40] build unrighteousness
[54:42] and the word of God will come and
[54:44] whether it be from theologians or
[54:46] reformers the word of God will come and
[54:48] bring the true and place it where it
[54:51] belongs where it was probed at and
[54:53] missed and placed in the wrong place and
[54:55] not figured out and made a really bad
[54:57] picture and you had your cow in the tree
[54:59] uh chewing cut up in the tree and
[55:01] picking grass in a tree and it's all
[55:03] messed up then the word of God comes and
[55:06] it may take a cow and puts it in the
[55:08] grass and he said oh well the cow was
[55:10] eating grass in that picture not this is
[55:12] now truth because the truth is being
[55:15] placed
[55:19] the LIE can look 99 true
[55:22] so are you ready
[55:24] if a lie can look 99 true then sometimes
[55:28] it's not hard for the devil to convince
[55:30] you that the truth is 100 alive
[55:36] huh
[55:39] is that too long for a bumper sticker
[55:43] if a lie can be 99 truth
[55:47] he said well that's a lie
[55:49] then it's not hard for the devil to say
[55:51] well that was a lie
[55:53] and it was 99 true
[55:56] so how hard would it be for something to
[55:58] be 100 alive
[56:01] because we maybe we can't do a DNA test
[56:04] and figure it all out scientifically
[56:05] it's just well that's a line why was it
[56:07] a lie well that was a lie
[56:09] he said well that was a lie what made it
[56:12] lie
[56:15] the devil pretending to be the truth
[56:17] then
[56:18] we're talking about the the devil's
[56:20] tactics
[56:21] the devil being to project into the
[56:22] future the devil sowing seeds himself
[56:24] the devil in Genesis chapter four didn't
[56:27] sit back and be like I did it I did it I
[56:29] got a cane I got a murder I didn't
[56:32] oh he's projecting out
[56:34] he's playing he's calculating he'd
[56:37] already caused a rebellion in heaven he
[56:38] got away with that he thinks he can get
[56:40] away with building his own kingdom on
[56:41] Earth and so he had he even himself he
[56:44] walketh about making due use of every
[56:46] opportunity so he's very calculating
[56:48] very deliberate doing certain things in
[56:51] such a way and as he can calculate out
[56:53] he has a plan of setting things in order
[56:57] and as he puts these things together
[57:00] he's trying to present himself as truth
[57:04] and so that whenever the light comes
[57:08] he while pretending to be the truth
[57:11] accuses the word of being a lie
[57:17] I don't know why that deserved a sip
[57:20] but that's what the devil does
[57:23] while pretending be the truth now that
[57:26] the word comes and exposes him while
[57:29] wearing truth clothes he says well
[57:30] that's a lie
[57:32] clearly this is a lie
[57:35] and I can tell you why it's a lie and I
[57:37] can show you why it's a lie and then use
[57:39] true things to try to convince you that
[57:41] the word is alive
[57:43] not trying to make you uncomfortable
[57:49] it'll actually accuse the word
[57:53] wow I pretend to be the truth accuse the
[57:55] word of repeating a lie that he started
[57:58] oh when God told you that you'd become
[58:00] his gods
[58:01] he's just repeating what the serpent
[58:03] said
[58:04] I mean he's just he's just repeating a
[58:06] lie
[58:07] when in reality the word is pointed out
[58:09] just how subtly
[58:11] the terror is the contradiction to the
[58:12] wheat
[58:15] meanwhile the Tara said no no no no I
[58:16] got this I got that I got this I got
[58:18] that the wheat's actually the LIE
[58:20] no this is the truth this is the truth
[58:22] no the weeks at Weeks actually the LIE
[58:25] and then people will believe the devil's
[58:27] lie
[58:28] because they just didn't get a
[58:30] revelation of the truth
[58:32] this is why Satan hates revelation
[58:35] because it upsets all his plans
[58:38] he hates Revelation he would love he
[58:40] would love to and I think I read the
[58:41] statement before how that the worst of
[58:43] all things is science that masquerades
[58:45] his faith
[58:46] that when you get behind it's like oh
[58:48] this is just all calculations and this
[58:50] is just all data and figures and this is
[58:53] just somebody who did a word search and
[58:54] just vomited it out
[58:57] there's no real truth behind this
[58:59] there's no real inspiration this is just
[59:01] this is just facts and figures this is
[59:04] just data this is just history
[59:07] this is this is just academic
[59:10] and that's the worst kind of science
[59:13] there is is the kind that masquerades as
[59:15] faith
[59:16] kind of masquerades as truth and
[59:18] masquerades as believing and people
[59:20] believe the lie because they haven't
[59:21] caught a revelation the truth and the
[59:24] Revelation is what exposes where the
[59:26] leaven is exposes where the air is the
[59:29] devil's been painting a picture well
[59:30] isn't this beautiful and we're going
[59:32] well I mean I see in the Bible there's a
[59:33] cup in the hand and I see there's fine
[59:35] linen and I see it does this and I see
[59:37] it does that and I see that there'll be
[59:38] signs and wonders and I see that it has
[59:39] this and I see that it has that and it's
[59:41] like well then maybe this is it and then
[59:43] the light comes on and shows you the
[59:45] truth
[59:46] shows you what the real is
[59:49] and the one you've been looking at the
[59:50] whole time is saying no no hold on hold
[59:52] on wait a minute see I was here first
[59:56] I was here first I am the original
[59:57] that's the copy
[1:00:01] you realize why we need Revelation more
[1:00:03] than anything
[1:00:06] we need a true revelation of the truth
[1:00:07] of God which is the spirit of God
[1:00:10] and a true revelation of the devil's lie
[1:00:14] which is the Antichrist Spirit we need
[1:00:16] that true revelation
[1:00:18] because with that if we can buy the
[1:00:21] truth discern and withstand the devil's
[1:00:23] lie Satan is powerless before us
[1:00:26] with true Revelation in our lives
[1:00:29] we can recognize the truth of God
[1:00:33] and the devil's lie
[1:00:35] and if by that truth we can discern and
[1:00:38] withstand the devil's lie he has no
[1:00:40] power
[1:00:41] the devil only has power through
[1:00:43] Darkness he only has power through a lie
[1:00:45] so if we can buy Revelation Discerning
[1:00:47] with uh discern the two Spirits or
[1:00:50] recognize the two Spirits within the
[1:00:51] framework of the Christian church
[1:00:53] and by God's spirit discern and
[1:00:55] withstand that Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:00:58] will be powerless before us and this is
[1:01:00] why the devil hates the truth of God
[1:01:05] this is why the devil imitates it to
[1:01:07] steal it away from the elect
[1:01:10] and I know that's a lot
[1:01:12] and a lot for you to think about
[1:01:14] but I've shared with you tonight this
[1:01:17] contest between the devil's lie and the
[1:01:20] truth of God and if you looked at it in
[1:01:21] the way that I styled it it looks like a
[1:01:22] court case because I used the V period
[1:01:24] instead of vs period which is more
[1:01:26] Sports versus what's law
[1:01:28] but it's a trial
[1:01:31] and one claims to be the truth
[1:01:33] and the other is the truth
[1:01:35] and the only way you'll be able to judge
[1:01:37] is by the spirit of God
[1:01:40] and the only way you'll be able to know
[1:01:41] is by the Holy Ghost
[1:01:43] and so what we want more than anything
[1:01:45] is revelation not an explanation
[1:01:48] I would even go so far to say is I we do
[1:01:51] not want to merely look for what we call
[1:01:53] demonstration
[1:01:55] apart from revelation
[1:01:57] because education creates impersonation
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:01] and you're getting all lost in your
[1:02:02] Asians
[1:02:04] if you don't have a revelation
[1:02:06] to provide the demonstration
[1:02:10] we need some instrumentation but Mike if
[1:02:12] you could come musicians please come
[1:02:15] the devil's lie
[1:02:18] against the truth of God
[1:02:22] remember this going forward no
[1:02:24] that the devil just wants to cause
[1:02:26] confusion about truth
[1:02:29] and don't be afraid when things seem
[1:02:31] confusing I'm not going to try to make
[1:02:32] things confusing but as you look at
[1:02:34] things and read things and study things
[1:02:35] out in your heart and God begins to deal
[1:02:36] with you there will be a voice of the
[1:02:38] enemy that comes by and tries to whisper
[1:02:40] to you
[1:02:41] to try to cause fear and anxiety about
[1:02:43] the truth of God's word and in that
[1:02:45] moment don't be afraid
[1:02:48] trust the Lord
[1:02:50] trust the Lord to show you what is truth
[1:02:53] has recently sat down with a group of
[1:02:55] ministers and we're just sitting down
[1:02:57] fellowshipping and we were talking about
[1:02:58] something in particular and I was just
[1:03:00] honest with them I said there's nothing
[1:03:01] you Brothers teach that I'm afraid of
[1:03:05] I'm not afraid of it
[1:03:08] I said because what if in my heart if I
[1:03:10] if I have the spirit of God he's
[1:03:12] obligated to reveal to me truth
[1:03:15] and I'm not afraid of what what someone
[1:03:17] else teaches I'm not afraid of what they
[1:03:18] believe because the only thing that
[1:03:21] truth can do is amplify the truth I
[1:03:23] already know by revelation
[1:03:25] if there's something that I've carnally
[1:03:27] figured out in my head then let the word
[1:03:29] bring light upon it for me to have
[1:03:31] understanding I I want to grow deeper in
[1:03:33] love with Christ and he can only be
[1:03:35] known to the light of his word so I
[1:03:36] don't want to build the kingdom of my
[1:03:38] own understanding and my intellectual
[1:03:40] conception and try to hide and build a
[1:03:42] tower that's so high that can't be
[1:03:43] assailed and just stack quotes up so
[1:03:46] high that Revelation can't ever get to
[1:03:48] me oh I wanted to come and break away
[1:03:51] every idea and every Kingdom and every
[1:03:53] thought and when he begins to take away
[1:03:55] from me things that might have seemed
[1:03:57] very very comforting and I begin to get
[1:03:59] a little anxious trust him he knows what
[1:04:01] he's doing
[1:04:03] and just know that this word of God that
[1:04:06] has come to us that sheds light on these
[1:04:08] things that we can trust them that the
[1:04:10] true is coming into view
[1:04:12] and the devil's been working for six
[1:04:14] thousand years
[1:04:15] to fight against this truth
[1:04:18] so that when it comes he's got 6 000
[1:04:21] years of data
[1:04:22] to throw at you to try to confuse you
[1:04:26] but the truth will prevail
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:31] he's just an imitator
[1:04:33] impersonating the word to steal it from
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:36] don't let them do it
[1:04:38] stand with me tonight
