[1:29] that's why we're here and
[1:31] i realize this is a wednesday night i'm
[1:33] always trying to be very mindful of the
[1:35] time
[1:36] and uh trying to find the mind of the
[1:38] lord while we were out and so forth
[1:40] so let's just if you if you have your
[1:42] bibles let's turn to
[1:44] two portions of scripture
[1:46] i'd like to turn to first thessalonians
[1:49] chapter five and this may be just a bit
[1:52] strange but
[1:53] i want to bring these two thoughts
[1:55] together tonight
[1:57] let's start with first thessalonians
[1:59] chapter 5
[2:02] verse 18.
[2:08] say amen when you find your places there
[2:11] we'll just read one verse there and then
[2:13] we'll go to revelations chapter one
[2:17] in everything give thanks
[2:21] for this is the will of god
[2:23] in christ jesus concerning you
[2:27] everything is brought
[2:29] in everything
[2:31] give thanks
[2:33] praise the lord let's turn to
[2:34] revelations chapter 1.
[2:40] and we'll start with verse 12.
[2:48] and i turn to see the voice
[2:51] that spake with me and being turned i
[2:53] saw seven golden candlesticks
[2:56] and in the midst of the seven
[2:58] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[3:01] man
[3:02] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[3:06] and gird about the paps with a golden
[3:08] girdle
[3:09] his head and his hair were like white as
[3:11] wool
[3:12] as white as snow
[3:14] and his eyes were a flame of fire
[3:17] and his feet like undefined brass as if
[3:20] they burned in a furnace
[3:22] and his voice as the sound of many
[3:25] waters
[3:26] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[3:30] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[3:32] two-edged sword
[3:34] and his countenance
[3:36] was as the sun
[3:38] shineth in its strength
[3:40] i want to preach tonight
[3:42] on the sun that shineth in its strength
[3:46] and i want to preach this as my
[3:49] thanksgiving message tonight
[3:51] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[3:53] prayer
[3:54] heavenly father
[3:56] we thank you lord as we stand before
[3:59] your purchase of your blood two thousand
[4:01] years ago at calvary
[4:03] you purchased lord your people
[4:06] and lord we realize as we approach
[4:09] the pulpit lord that it's a serious
[4:11] thing
[4:12] that we're not handling it loosely
[4:15] so lord as we bow our heads we thank you
[4:17] dear god for an opportunity to gather in
[4:19] your name
[4:20] and lord to feed upon the bread of life
[4:24] we ask god that you call our nerves
[4:27] that every one of us lord would give our
[4:28] full attention to you
[4:30] and the lord that our hearts would be
[4:32] open in our ears to hear your voice lord
[4:36] quiet enough in our spirit that we can
[4:39] hear what you're speaking to our lives
[4:41] and i pray lord god that that our
[4:43] humanity would not restrict the moving
[4:46] of the spirit but lord your holy spirit
[4:48] would go minister to the needs of your
[4:50] people
[4:51] and father i pray that you bless this
[4:53] people lord i pray god that you bless
[4:56] brother aaron and you bless this church
[4:58] dear god and you bless its young people
[5:01] and you bless lord them in battle and
[5:03] you bless them coming and going and
[5:05] father we pray god that the holy spirit
[5:07] would just touch every heart
[5:09] in jesus christ mighty name
[5:12] amen god bless you saints you can have
[5:14] your seats tonight
[5:18] when jesus raised again
[5:21] he had come and he found peter
[5:24] no doubt peter was having a struggle in
[5:26] himself
[5:28] because peter knew that he had denied
[5:30] the lord
[5:32] and even in peter's weakness and failure
[5:35] jesus went right after him
[5:38] don't that make you feel good
[5:40] that he never writes you off when you
[5:42] make big blunders and that's this was a
[5:44] big one
[5:45] but he never writes you off but he goes
[5:47] right back after you and he said now
[5:49] we're going to build from here
[5:52] praise the lord
[5:53] and as he told peter he said peter do
[5:56] you love me
[5:57] peter said yes lord i love you said i
[5:59] want you to feed my sheep
[6:02] do you love me peter said lord you you
[6:04] know that i love you said feed my lambs
[6:08] peter do you love me and he said lord
[6:10] you know i love you
[6:12] amen that's the way god likes to hear it
[6:14] sometimes
[6:16] lord you know it's coming from my heart
[6:19] you know that i love you
[6:22] he said feed my sheep
[6:25] he told peter he said when you were
[6:27] young you went anywhere you wanted to go
[6:30] but when you grow old another shall
[6:32] guard thee and you will go where you
[6:33] wouldn't normally go
[6:36] and the bible said that the lord was
[6:38] telling him of his death
[6:41] and peter still quick at this trigger
[6:43] looked back at the one whom jesus loved
[6:46] following and he said and what will this
[6:49] man do
[6:51] and jesus said what's it to you
[6:54] if he tarry till i come
[6:57] he said follow thou me
[6:59] and there went out of saying that john
[7:01] would not see death but jesus never said
[7:03] that
[7:04] he just said what's that to you if he
[7:06] tarry till i come
[7:08] follow thou me
[7:10] and so we find as jesus spoke a word of
[7:13] prophecy to peter's life that the holy
[7:16] spirit actually led peter to crucifixion
[7:20] just exactly
[7:22] like our lord said
[7:24] but john had a very different destiny
[7:28] and because we're believers god leads us
[7:31] in different places
[7:33] and he take and in one size don't fit
[7:36] all
[7:36] we got to be very careful we'll say well
[7:38] god dealt with me this way that's the
[7:40] way he'll do it with you that way god
[7:43] doesn't work that way god has a purpose
[7:45] for every one here every life here
[7:49] you're to do a specific work for god and
[7:51] him alone and i'll say like the lord
[7:54] what's it to you
[7:55] what anyone else does
[7:57] follow the lord
[7:59] for your life
[8:01] peter had our paul or john rather had a
[8:04] very different walk in his life and we
[8:07] find john was arrested
[8:10] for preaching the gospel
[8:12] and they put him in a a boiling vat of
[8:15] oil
[8:16] and we know that the other disciples
[8:18] died and murder him but john his life
[8:21] was different god had a different a
[8:23] different place for him in the body and
[8:26] they boiled him in oil all night long
[8:30] and brother branham said they could not
[8:32] destroy him
[8:33] because god's purpose for john was not
[8:36] yet done
[8:38] amen god the devil cannot touch you
[8:41] until god is done with you
[8:44] i believe it was george whitefield and
[8:47] he said i am immortal until god is done
[8:50] with me
[8:51] praise the mighty name of the lord god
[8:54] was keeping john
[8:56] but then because they couldn't kill john
[9:00] they he was banished to the aisle called
[9:02] patmos
[9:04] now this is the one that jesus loved
[9:08] what's he doing
[9:11] in patmos
[9:13] isn't it a strange place that if god
[9:16] loved john
[9:17] that he would banish him to a prison
[9:19] island or rocky island about 30 miles
[9:23] around and scorpions and snakes and just
[9:26] the worst of the worst criminals
[9:30] why would god put a man that he loved in
[9:33] a place like that furthermore he's going
[9:37] to be left there to die he was in there
[9:39] for two years but he was going to be
[9:41] there left to die
[9:44] and it's at these times when the devil
[9:46] can really get in our minds
[9:48] it's times like this when we find
[9:50] ourselves on a desert island with rocks
[9:53] and lizards and snakes and criminals why
[9:56] i feel forsaken lord
[9:59] what am i doing here
[10:01] why am i here i would i mean i was
[10:04] walking with the lord i can help so many
[10:07] out there why would you put me here
[10:11] then he begins to you know how the devil
[10:13] can jump on you
[10:15] get in your mind and that's real
[10:17] dangerous when we begin to reason james
[10:21] i love james and he was thrust through
[10:23] with the sword
[10:25] and philip was crucified upside down or
[10:29] crucified on a stake and peter was
[10:31] crucified upside down and matthew
[10:34] drugged through the streets
[10:37] i loved him brothers lord and now i am
[10:40] here when is my turn
[10:44] you go right down through every one of
[10:46] those beloved believers that died so
[10:49] shamefully
[10:51] what am i doing here lord
[10:54] has anyone ever felt that way before
[10:57] and then we know very well the scripture
[10:59] said somehow in these conditions john
[11:03] got into the spirit
[11:06] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[11:10] without a friend
[11:12] on a dessert island i was in the spirit
[11:16] on the lord's day
[11:18] and there when he broke into the spirit
[11:20] the clouds moved back and he saw the
[11:23] sevenfold glory of his person
[11:27] he saw the lord as the sun that's
[11:29] shining at its power
[11:32] hallelujah
[11:34] brother branham said this he said you go
[11:37] out any day you want to
[11:39] and he said the sun is shining
[11:42] he said no
[11:44] you sometimes there's clouds and you
[11:46] can't see it
[11:48] but the sun
[11:49] is still shining
[11:52] and he said that's just like us you know
[11:54] we we get down we get gloomy on the
[11:57] great days and the rain and the storms
[12:00] but nonetheless the sun still shines
[12:05] you might not be able to see it
[12:07] but i want to tell you tonight that god
[12:09] is on the throne
[12:11] when you're in your trials god is still
[12:13] on the throne when you're sick god is
[12:16] still on the throne
[12:19] the sun is still shining
[12:21] but you know you have to be in the
[12:23] spirit because it's only faith that sees
[12:26] what god sees
[12:30] if we could see from god's perspective
[12:33] john got a very different perspective
[12:36] once god revealed his purpose to john we
[12:39] can oh and we ought to be thankful
[12:42] because john wrote us a personal letter
[12:44] from the lord
[12:46] and it was so we could make a rapture
[12:50] he was banished there and he wrote the
[12:52] book of revelation brother branham
[12:53] actually said john was too busy with
[12:56] telling people his testimony going
[12:58] church to church he said he had to get
[13:00] him quiet
[13:01] our trials ain't to hurt us sometimes
[13:04] it's to get us real quiet
[13:06] and get us spiritual in a condition we
[13:09] can hear from god
[13:11] hallelujah
[13:13] at the end he's screaming come lord
[13:15] jesus come
[13:18] john didn't have it so bad after all
[13:21] once he saw the clouds roll back
[13:24] once he saw god's purpose for his life
[13:29] and every one of you have a purpose from
[13:30] god if you're alive if you've got breath
[13:32] in your lungs you have a purpose from
[13:35] god
[13:36] but we don't see the purpose sometimes
[13:38] and it causes us to struggle because the
[13:40] devil will bombard our minds
[13:43] turn with me if you will grab your
[13:44] bibles turn to hebrews chapter 11.
[13:48] do you love the lord with all your
[13:49] hearts
[13:52] hebrews
[13:55] chapter 11.
[13:58] i saw brother fritz pop back in there
[14:00] and i was so good to see him he's a
[14:02] friend of the family
[14:03] good to see you all here tonight hebrews
[14:06] 11 verse 23
[14:09] says by faith
[14:12] moses when he was born was hid three
[14:15] months of his parents
[14:17] because they saw he was a proper child
[14:21] and they were not afraid of the king's
[14:23] commandment
[14:25] see moses was born the very instrument
[14:28] of god
[14:29] this was the one that god would use to
[14:31] deliver his people according to the
[14:34] promise that he made abraham
[14:36] and this is not speaking of moses faith
[14:39] this is speaking this verse of his
[14:42] mother's faith and his father's faith by
[14:45] faith moses was hid when he was born
[14:49] his wife was the daughter of levi
[14:52] her
[14:52] her name was jochebed
[14:55] and she knew that god's hand was on
[14:58] moses the bible don't tell us how but
[15:01] brother branham said he believed by
[15:02] divine revelation she knew that this was
[15:06] god's chosen
[15:09] and that because she knew that her child
[15:13] was from god she was not afraid of the
[15:16] king's commandment
[15:18] she was not afraid she was not
[15:19] intimidated she knew somehow that moses
[15:23] must come through
[15:25] because when you have faith your fear
[15:28] drops away
[15:30] amen we don't want to be controlled by
[15:32] fear we want to be controlled by faith
[15:35] in the word of god
[15:36] can you say amen
[15:38] and she knew that god would keep his
[15:40] word god can't keep not keep his word
[15:43] she knew it and she had faith burning in
[15:46] her heart according to this verse
[15:49] but the bible said that she hit him for
[15:51] three months and when she could not hide
[15:54] him any longer they had to he was like a
[15:57] hot potato they had to do something with
[16:00] moses
[16:01] and brother branham said that she was
[16:03] crying and the you remember the story
[16:05] the witches were knocking on the door
[16:08] and they said we know that you got a
[16:10] baby in there
[16:12] and brother branham said they could tell
[16:13] that she was a nurse and mother and they
[16:15] said you're just a matter of time deary
[16:17] we'll get the baby
[16:19] brother branham dramatizes it really
[16:21] nice they call them policewomen
[16:23] these are the policewomen say we'll be
[16:25] back we'll we'll find that baby they
[16:28] searched and could not find it said the
[16:30] baby would why they'd hide that they
[16:32] brother branham dramatizes it
[16:33] beautifully
[16:35] so jochebed looks to amram said honey
[16:38] what are we going to do
[16:40] oh they're going to kill the baby
[16:43] god hasn't told us what to do what he
[16:45] said honey
[16:46] how many remember brother branham taught
[16:48] amram was a prayer warrior
[16:51] he said honey i'm oh i'm going to go
[16:53] upstairs and i'm going to pray
[16:55] and he said he prayed and poured his
[16:57] heart out to god and god gave amram a
[16:59] dream
[17:01] brother branham says this he said god
[17:03] gave amram a dream and gave him
[17:05] instructions how to make the ark
[17:08] and he said he told jochebed the pattern
[17:11] and of the ark that he saw and jochebed
[17:14] by faith makes an ark for the baby
[17:18] do you remember that brother branham
[17:20] taught that now jochebed made an ark and
[17:23] covered it in pitch and that word is the
[17:26] same word in leviticus that is used for
[17:29] the word atonement
[17:31] meaning there was an atonement between
[17:34] the baby and the devil between the baby
[17:37] and the enemy you have an atonement and
[17:40] you are immortal as long as you're doing
[17:43] god's purpose on earth
[17:47] hallelujah do you love the lord
[17:51] and he said at night because they could
[17:53] hide him no longer he said jochebed and
[17:56] amram they got up miriam and aaron and
[17:59] they snuck down to the river
[18:02] and he said that the kids are crying
[18:04] they're like papa you're not going to
[18:05] put the baby in the river
[18:09] he said
[18:10] we must be strong soldiers now
[18:13] god won't let nothing harm this baby
[18:16] we're being unctioned and led and moved
[18:19] by the holy spirit
[18:21] so they snuck down the street
[18:23] they snuck down to the river
[18:26] and there he said that he said now he
[18:28] said we're going to put the baby in the
[18:30] river now remember every other baby is
[18:33] being put in the same river and the
[18:35] crocodiles are crunching them and eating
[18:37] them
[18:38] this baby is going in the same river
[18:41] but the difference between this baby and
[18:43] all the other babies is the atonement
[18:47] and so all that moses of miriam and
[18:50] aaron they kissed the baby and they
[18:52] kissed the baby said now nurse the baby
[18:54] before we put it in the ark and so mama
[18:56] nurses the baby
[18:58] and and everybody's you know just daddy
[19:01] daddy is it gonna be okay he said god
[19:03] has to he won't fail us he gave us this
[19:06] baby god and he's pumping the the family
[19:09] full of faith they close the little lid
[19:13] and at this point is where faith begins
[19:16] to move i want everyone to listen very
[19:18] closely
[19:19] because brother branham said now this is
[19:22] unnatural for a mother to put her baby
[19:25] in death
[19:27] it's completely against human nature
[19:30] a woman will go through fire to save her
[19:33] baby
[19:34] but jochebed under the inspiration of
[19:38] faith
[19:39] takes this baby and said lord i don't
[19:42] understand my situation
[19:45] all i know is you gave me this baby and
[19:48] i know your hand is upon it
[19:51] but by faith you gave it to me by faith
[19:54] i give it back
[19:56] and brother branham said that jock a bed
[20:00] her eagle eye was piercing through the
[20:02] clouds and through the worry and through
[20:05] the fear and through the unbelief and
[20:08] she saw the promise of god
[20:12] and by faith she pushed that baby into
[20:14] the water and when she pushed that baby
[20:18] heaven stood to its feet
[20:21] hallelujah now god dispatched his angels
[20:25] and angels lined all the way down the
[20:28] nile river
[20:29] hallelujah why because there was a word
[20:32] of promise given to amram and given to
[20:35] jochebed and now the armies of heaven is
[20:38] guiding them
[20:40] when you have faith in god even when you
[20:43] can't see the sun shining it's still
[20:45] shining god is still on the throne
[20:48] when you follow the word he'll send his
[20:50] angels
[20:53] how many believe that
[20:55] hallelujah and we find because of that
[20:59] brother branham said now her eyes of
[21:01] faith
[21:02] she saw what god was going to do
[21:05] she knew by faith she believed behind
[21:09] the clouds
[21:10] behind this trial behind the darkness
[21:14] there was a living god that will take
[21:16] the baby to its destination
[21:20] the same living god will take you to
[21:22] your destination
[21:24] if we can look past the clouds and the
[21:26] trials that we go through god's purpose
[21:29] cannot be defeated
[21:32] you're fearfully and wonderfully made
[21:34] with a divine purpose and god is going
[21:37] to place you where he needs you and it
[21:39] cannot be defeated
[21:41] it cannot be hindered
[21:43] it cannot stand on the word of the lord
[21:46] trials will be there
[21:48] you won't always see the presence of god
[21:51] you're not it's sometimes it's raining
[21:53] and it's storming you don't know which
[21:55] way to go
[21:58] but god is faithful to his word
[22:02] everybody love the lord
[22:04] i love it because god's eye was on baby
[22:06] moses
[22:08] god's eye guided that little baby
[22:10] through the crocodiles and all the way
[22:13] to its destination
[22:15] amen don't you love the lord with all
[22:17] your heart
[22:19] i love the way brother branham said he
[22:20] said he called gabriel he said line them
[22:23] angels out but he said don't let nothing
[22:26] touch that baby they said where will you
[22:28] be lord he said i'll be at the receiving
[22:30] end
[22:31] god is at the receiving end
[22:34] he's calling you from the other side
[22:37] how many love the lord with all their
[22:39] hearts
[22:40] see but you must look through the clouds
[22:42] to see the sun shining in its power
[22:45] shining in its glory god never
[22:47] diminishes
[22:49] the holy ghost never diminishes
[22:51] god is still god right now
[22:55] hallelujah
[22:57] god brought it right to the alligator
[22:59] beds right into the king's palace
[23:02] now brother branham said now we may not
[23:04] be able to see it
[23:06] times it gets dark
[23:09] the clouds may hide his blessed face for
[23:12] a season
[23:13] but remember the clouds may hide his
[23:16] face but it don't hide him
[23:19] it can hide the sun from you but it's
[23:21] still shining behind the clouds and
[23:24] faith sees the sun beyond the cloud
[23:29] hallelujah even in your trials you're
[23:31] looking through those trials
[23:34] he said now hear moses mother in a
[23:36] conflict
[23:37] was a testing of her faith god was
[23:40] testing her faith
[23:42] and every child every son that cometh to
[23:45] god must be tried because god will test
[23:49] your faith
[23:52] now look god could have simply bypassed
[23:54] this whole thing
[23:56] and and he said but
[23:58] it's better when god gives you a test
[24:00] isn't that interesting he could have god
[24:03] could have changed the whole thing he
[24:04] could have made moses invisible and
[24:06] every time the police women come they're
[24:09] invisible and they're blind we know god
[24:10] can do that
[24:12] see but god made a custom-made test
[24:16] and he knew she was going to pass it
[24:19] your tasks are not to hurt you it is
[24:21] because god knows you'll bring the devil
[24:24] to shame
[24:26] oh yeah stand on the word of god
[24:30] bless the mighty name of the lord
[24:33] there is a veil
[24:35] right now according to the scriptures
[24:37] angels are right in this room
[24:40] and there is a veil of the flesh we do
[24:42] not see them but our faith declares them
[24:46] and we don't see them but we feel the
[24:49] effects of their presence can you say
[24:52] amen
[24:53] it is a veil that keeps us from seeing
[24:56] god it is a veil that keeps us from
[24:59] seeing that other dimension
[25:01] but it's there anyway
[25:04] remember at dolphin how gehasa said lord
[25:06] the syrians assyrians and elijah said
[25:09] there's more of us and there is them
[25:11] lord open his eyes
[25:13] and when he opened his eyes it changed
[25:16] the scene all together
[25:18] if god could open our eyes and let us
[25:21] see we are not barely making it but we
[25:24] are a part of the army of the lord of
[25:27] hosts and god will not be defeated and
[25:30] there's more of us than there is them
[25:34] it would encourage our hearts
[25:36] to see the sun shining in its power
[25:40] hallelujah you'll never see the son of
[25:43] god shining in his power until you break
[25:46] into that faith to see it
[25:50] god open our eyes like gaheza
[25:53] let us see lord that we're not the bible
[25:56] said we don't not look at the things
[25:58] which are seen
[25:59] but we look at the things that are
[26:01] unseen
[26:03] hallelujah
[26:05] when god spoke the sun
[26:08] he set the sun in its orbit
[26:10] and every one of us here none of us
[26:12] doubt the rising of the sun tomorrow
[26:16] there ain't no one here that's biting
[26:18] their nails and anxious do you think the
[26:20] sun's going to make it tomorrow brother
[26:22] no you have a full confidence
[26:25] that sun is going to rise you got
[26:27] perfect faith in that
[26:29] why because god spoke it and god set
[26:33] that son in order
[26:36] until it must obey
[26:38] god's command
[26:41] and did you know that the son of god
[26:43] died rose again
[26:45] and sent us a pentecost
[26:48] sent us an outpouring of the holy spirit
[26:52] and that has been shining for 2 000
[26:55] years even in the dark ages
[26:59] even in the worst persecutions against
[27:02] the church
[27:03] even when the antichrist rose
[27:06] and the devil rode his horse riders
[27:09] god was still shining in his power
[27:12] because john john saw him walking in the
[27:15] midst of the seven candlesticks
[27:18] when they did not know he was there he
[27:21] was still shining
[27:24] when he didn't feel like he was there he
[27:27] was still there
[27:30] in the worst times of the church he was
[27:33] still there
[27:36] why because god promised i will never
[27:39] leave you nor forsake you
[27:42] now denomination has smothered out the
[27:45] word of god but the sun is still shining
[27:49] what trial is there
[27:51] among us what trial is there
[27:54] that would blot out the presence of god
[27:57] or break the very word of god
[28:00] god made a promise to israel and said as
[28:03] i set the sun in the heavens
[28:06] and i commanded the stars in their place
[28:09] so will israel always be my chosen
[28:13] and it is a witness that my word will
[28:16] never be broken
[28:19] is there a trial is there a place a
[28:22] depression an anxiety a spiritual
[28:25] condition that can blot god out of his
[28:29] word and and no
[28:31] he is still shining in his power
[28:36] how many can say men i believe that it
[28:39] shines every day now we don't see it
[28:43] because of the clouds
[28:47] because of our clouds
[28:51] because of our reasoning
[28:55] because of our humanity these clouds
[28:59] stand between us and god
[29:02] but he's still every bit what he was on
[29:05] the day of pentecost
[29:08] can you say amen
[29:10] and he is the same yesterday today and
[29:14] forever
[29:15] as long as there is a forever god is
[29:18] still god
[29:24] you love the lord
[29:28] what happens we get clouds of doubt
[29:31] uh greed selfishness
[29:34] clouds that actually break us away from
[29:37] the presence of god
[29:41] but what we must do is move those clouds
[29:44] away
[29:46] that's our job
[29:47] every one of us got to move these clouds
[29:50] away
[29:53] amen
[29:54] remember remember paul
[29:57] you know
[29:58] paul
[29:59] they were to loose from crete and the
[30:02] spirit of the lord said don't tell them
[30:03] warn them
[30:04] they should not loose right now
[30:07] paul said i i think there's trouble up
[30:09] ahead we should not lose ah who are you
[30:11] just a prisoner
[30:13] so they got on the boat and they hit
[30:15] troubled waters
[30:17] the bible said that they they had not
[30:20] seen the sun for 14 days and winds and
[30:23] gales and and squalls and there
[30:26] they lose all hope of even being saved
[30:29] every one of them
[30:31] brother branham said there were hundreds
[30:33] of sharks following the boat
[30:35] and they had not even seen a star or a
[30:38] moon or there was no hope at all
[30:40] sometimes we get there
[30:43] and paul was down there praying
[30:45] and the galilee brother bradham said and
[30:48] god gave him a vision and said paul
[30:51] i give you everyone on the boat not a
[30:53] hair of their head will be lost and you
[30:56] will stand before caesar
[30:59] so while the gales the boat is rocking
[31:02] and the people are vomiting over to sign
[31:04] the ship and paul comes out and said
[31:06] brother
[31:07] praise the lord
[31:11] he lost his mind he got seasickness
[31:14] he said praise the lord
[31:17] eat your heart to content
[31:20] none of us are going to be harmed
[31:24] praise the lord
[31:27] eat your sandwich brother brandon said
[31:29] he was eating on a sandwich what
[31:31] happened
[31:32] faith broke through the clouds
[31:35] of worry and fred and weary
[31:38] faith broke through till it caught the
[31:41] mind of god and god made a promise and
[31:44] said paul you will stand before caesar
[31:50] so paul he gets on an island and a viper
[31:52] bites him he shakes it off in the fire
[31:55] i've got to appear before caesar i think
[31:58] that's what we ought to do with our
[31:59] child is shake the devil off and say god
[32:03] promised me that i'm gonna make a
[32:05] rapture
[32:07] hallelujah
[32:08] but it takes your faith to rise above
[32:12] that trial
[32:15] hallelujah
[32:17] in that storm the sun was still shining
[32:21] amen
[32:23] don't that make you feel good
[32:25] makes me feel good too you're not
[32:28] looking at the wind the gales the
[32:30] panicking ship members you're not
[32:33] looking at the condition of the ship
[32:35] you're not looking at the sharks you're
[32:37] looking at a promise
[32:39] you've got to get your eyes off of
[32:42] everything and focus upon the word of
[32:46] the living god
[32:49] you know that's how brother branham made
[32:51] it through
[32:52] lost his friends didn't have a church
[32:55] even with an open door he had to keep
[32:58] his eye on the word of the lord when he
[33:00] looked dried up
[33:02] there was a promise of us coming
[33:06] amen
[33:07] but in your trials you cannot look at
[33:09] those trials focus not even meditate
[33:12] upon them you have got to meditate upon
[33:14] the word
[33:16] and what you need to do in your trial is
[33:18] say god give me a scripture that i can
[33:21] tie myself to
[33:23] and let that become your absolute in
[33:26] your trial
[33:28] said god in my trial in my heartache
[33:32] give me a word and let god give you that
[33:36] word that will anchor you in the time of
[33:38] a storm
[33:41] then it's your revelation and then you
[33:43] can look that the sun is still shining
[33:47] in its power
[33:49] hallelujah
[33:51] look beyond the shadows
[33:54] look beyond the shadows of your physical
[33:56] body of your sickness of your oppression
[34:00] of your worry look beyond it and look to
[34:03] the promise of god and let the light
[34:06] break through in your life
[34:09] let his rays send his love and his power
[34:13] into your life
[34:16] there's people standing over the grave
[34:19] of their loved ones
[34:22] weeping and crying because bad things
[34:25] happen to good people
[34:27] weeping over a lost child that suffered
[34:31] and they're crying over a dead corpse
[34:35] but by faith we can look beyond and see
[34:38] a land of immortality where there will
[34:40] be no tears and no more sorrow
[34:43] where we will be reunited with our loved
[34:45] ones we can look beyond the
[34:47] circumstances
[34:49] even when we don't have answers
[34:52] we're a people that have information at
[34:55] our fingertips google it google it it's
[34:58] ridiculous sometimes god says no google
[35:01] i want faith in my word
[35:05] he does it and he won't answer you
[35:08] because he knows you're going to pass
[35:10] he knows you're a jockbit
[35:12] he knows you're an amram that'll take
[35:14] your life and give it into god's hands
[35:19] because you know there is a living god
[35:21] that sent this message
[35:23] there is a living god that is preparing
[35:26] us for his return
[35:28] hallelujah bless the mighty name of the
[35:31] lord
[35:33] eyes of faith will tell you he's here
[35:36] right now
[35:38] how many believe that
[35:39] eyes of faith will say you know what no
[35:42] matter how i feel even on a wednesday
[35:44] night service the lord is here right now
[35:49] amen we believe that with all of our
[35:51] hearts
[35:52] i like what brother branham said in
[35:54] later seeing church age he said he is
[35:56] working all things at this moment
[35:59] according to the purpose of his own will
[36:02] he's right in the midst of us all
[36:05] he said he's right in the midst of his
[36:07] church
[36:08] the great creator savior god is
[36:12] faithfully working amongst his own right
[36:15] now as the great shepherd of the sheep
[36:17] how many say i believe that
[36:21] his very existence
[36:24] is for his own amen
[36:30] the self-existing one who always was and
[36:33] always will be his existence
[36:36] is for you
[36:40] sometimes the clouds come over and said
[36:42] but he don't love you brother
[36:45] he forgot about this one
[36:48] but his very existence for us
[36:51] how many say i received that amen
[36:55] his very existence is for his own
[36:59] he loves them he cares for them his eye
[37:02] is ever upon them
[37:05] and when the word says your lives are
[37:07] hid with christ and god it means exactly
[37:11] what it says
[37:12] hallelujah
[37:14] oh i'm so glad that my god abides
[37:17] faithful
[37:19] he is true to himself he won't lie he is
[37:22] true to the word he will back it up he
[37:25] is true to us he will lose none of us
[37:28] but he will raise us up at the last day
[37:31] and i'm glad i'm resting on his
[37:34] faithfulness
[37:36] he is shining in his glory and in his
[37:39] power but it's only to the believer
[37:44] did you know the bible said jesus was
[37:47] the light of the world
[37:48] and that he had the light of life
[37:51] i want you to think that jesus is
[37:54] shining in his power
[37:56] the sun that's what john saw i saw the
[37:59] sun
[38:00] shining in its strength
[38:02] you know the sun when god said let there
[38:04] be light
[38:06] the great sun
[38:08] came over the earth and there were seeds
[38:10] in the earth
[38:12] and that sun commanded those scenes
[38:15] seeds to bring forth of its kind
[38:18] and it brought forth wheat and fruit and
[38:22] garden to feed the earth
[38:26] because the sun equals life
[38:30] but it was only a type of a much greater
[38:33] light
[38:34] than a light that would bring forth
[38:37] earthly life mortal life or botany life
[38:41] but when the son of god rose in his
[38:44] power he brought forth immortal life he
[38:48] brought forth eternal life
[38:51] if we could only get our souls under the
[38:54] presence of that son what god put in you
[38:57] will bring forth of its kind
[39:01] he will bring forth the full
[39:03] manifestation
[39:04] of the word of the living god
[39:07] get that word in your heart and let the
[39:10] sun shine in its power it will bring
[39:13] forth a body change a bride it'll bring
[39:17] forth healing it'll bring forth miracles
[39:22] because he's shining in his power
[39:25] amen
[39:27] our alcatraz
[39:28] our patmos isn't so bad after all
[39:31] when god is only working out his own
[39:33] glory
[39:35] he's shining in his strength he is a
[39:39] healer like he's always been but brother
[39:42] brenham said look
[39:44] he said those clouds they hang over the
[39:46] sun
[39:48] it only keeps it from shining if you get
[39:51] rid of those clouds
[39:53] he will be shining like he did on the
[39:56] day of pentecost
[39:58] how many feel that way
[40:02] god's word is eternal
[40:05] god said let there be there was
[40:09] you hold to that word no matter what
[40:11] comes or goes
[40:13] he's still god
[40:15] he's still your savior he's still on the
[40:18] throne
[40:20] amen
[40:22] that's what i love about jonah
[40:24] jonah swallowed you know jonah's made a
[40:27] big blunder
[40:29] and now he's swallowed by a whale his
[40:32] sins finds him out he's in the belly of
[40:35] a whale covered in seaweed
[40:38] but brother branham said you know it's
[40:40] our conditions
[40:42] these conditions cause our faith to rise
[40:45] because human beings will always take
[40:47] the path of least resistance
[40:50] we all love us we're like oh i believe
[40:52] it but i sure don't want to go down that
[40:53] path god will force you to it
[40:56] because he wants to show the devil
[40:58] what's in his children
[41:00] and so brother branham takes up for
[41:02] jonah and said no jonah was in a
[41:05] backslid god was guiding him the whole
[41:07] time
[41:08] god was in the storm god was in the sea
[41:12] god was in the fish god was everywhere
[41:15] he looked
[41:18] but because he was running
[41:20] from the presence of the lord he
[41:23] couldn't see god
[41:25] but god got him down to where he could
[41:27] have a good old-fashioned prayer meeting
[41:30] covered in seaweed
[41:32] he turns i don't know how he found his
[41:34] direction but he found the temple and he
[41:38] began praying towards the temple
[41:42] because god now was going to show even
[41:45] in the belly of the whale my power and
[41:47] glory is still shining
[41:50] and as soon as he looked beyond the
[41:52] well's belly and beyond his own failure
[41:56] and looked to him that was in the temple
[41:59] all of a sudden the power and glory of
[42:01] god fell and brought forth one of the
[42:04] greatest types of the bible of jesus
[42:07] christ
[42:08] god can reverse your mistakes god can
[42:11] show his glory and his power
[42:15] god can reverse the devil's curse
[42:18] and turn it into a blessing in your life
[42:22] but you got to quit looking at yourself
[42:24] and everything around you and you've got
[42:26] to anchor in the word of god and look to
[42:29] a god that will not fail you
[42:34] hallelujah
[42:36] bless the mighty name of the lord
[42:39] i don't know what time it is i can't
[42:41] calculate my time
[42:43] everything okay
[42:46] brother branham told a story in germany
[42:48] once there was a big painting on the
[42:50] wall and he said just look from from
[42:52] here to that wall maybe look hideous
[42:55] look like clouds and storms and gloom
[42:58] and and so forth bad atmosphere he said
[43:01] but as he
[43:02] got closer
[43:04] and closer to the painting he said it
[43:06] ain't clouds at all
[43:09] he said no the man the painter he said
[43:11] as he made it that when you got close to
[43:14] it
[43:14] it was actually angel wings beating
[43:17] together
[43:18] your trials isn't god's wrath upon you
[43:23] you've got to get closer maybe on your
[43:25] knees where you can look upright and you
[43:28] will find brother branham said it's
[43:29] actually your trials as a blessing in
[43:32] disguise
[43:35] you'll find your trials will put you in
[43:37] a place where god will bless you from
[43:40] there
[43:41] he'll put your soul in a condition he'll
[43:44] put your attitude in a condition he'll
[43:47] put you in a place to use you so all
[43:50] things say all things
[43:52] all things work together for the good
[43:56] that god is still on the throne
[43:59] that god is still your savior
[44:02] amen he's our shepherd
[44:05] how many can say yes i've seen that in
[44:07] my my own life you know dreary times it
[44:11] actually it was not god angry it was a
[44:14] blessing in disguise god turned it
[44:16] into a blessing
[44:20] when you're discouraged the devil can
[44:21] really pour it on you
[44:24] but you know brother branham said you
[44:26] were not meant to be depressed god did
[44:28] not create you to be that way you were

[49:43] around the message he's still god
[49:46] now i want to i want to turn this just a
[49:49] bit
[49:51] because he said give thanks in
[49:52] everything and it's very important
[49:55] the word thanks is a very important word
[50:00] two thousand years ago there was a
[50:02] little brother adam said a
[50:03] fifteen-year-old girl mary virgin
[50:06] come out of nasa no good thing comes out
[50:08] of nazareth
[50:12] she's going to get married to a widower
[50:16] she's carrying a little bucket early in
[50:18] the morning to the well
[50:20] she's thinking about i'm fixing to get
[50:22] married you know how girls
[50:24] how they do
[50:28] brother branham said she saw a light
[50:30] flicker and she turned
[50:32] nobody was there
[50:34] he said he was trying to cut her off
[50:37] she come around a little narrow way
[50:39] and there was standing gabriel
[50:43] and he addresses mary
[50:46] hail mary
[50:48] thou art highly favored before god
[50:51] you will have a son
[50:54] for he that is within you shall be
[50:56] called the child of the highest
[50:59] and she said how should these things be
[51:02] i don't know a man
[51:04] he said the holy spirit shall overshadow
[51:06] thee
[51:08] she said be it to me according to thy
[51:10] word
[51:13] now
[51:14] i want you to think let's go back
[51:16] you're that 15 year old girl
[51:20] what is joseph going to think
[51:23] are you going to be able to convince
[51:26] joseph
[51:28] that this is real
[51:31] what about your family
[51:33] what about your church
[51:36] what about your closest friends you've
[51:38] always had a reputation but are they
[51:41] gonna buy this one
[51:44] can you imagine the mind battles that
[51:47] the devil would have ensued upon her
[51:50] at this moment
[51:53] but mary the bible said
[51:56] did not do that
[51:59] immediately brother branham said she
[52:01] took god at his word
[52:04] and said beat unto me according to thy
[52:07] word
[52:09] and brother branham said she started
[52:12] thanking him
[52:13] hallelujah the scripture says that
[52:16] mary said my soul doth magnify the lord
[52:20] she began to praise god and thank him
[52:24] because he took her from a low place and
[52:26] set her in a high place
[52:28] brother branham said that
[52:31] 800 years before that isaiah spoke and
[52:34] that word went down through 800 years
[52:38] until it lodged in the womb of a virgin
[52:42] and when she began to thank god and
[52:44] praise god and testify it created an
[52:48] atmosphere around the word that was in
[52:51] her
[52:55] and she began to water the word that god
[52:59] placed in her womb
[53:01] and brother branham said god give us
[53:03] more memories
[53:05] not that we're
[53:06] entertaining the clouds of doubt if god
[53:09] is going to give you a baby god will
[53:11] make a way when there is no way god will
[53:14] take care of joseph god will take care
[53:16] of your family god will take care of
[53:18] your reputation and he did because he's
[53:22] still on the throne
[53:26] but we must create an atmosphere
[53:29] upon the word that god has sown into his
[53:33] church
[53:35] many times in the healing lines and i'm
[53:37] i'm conscious of the time i don't know
[53:39] what time it is but i'm conscious can we
[53:42] go a little further
[53:44] i won't i try i'm trying not to hold you
[53:46] along
[53:47] many times in the prayer lines you watch
[53:49] i love to study the discernments brother
[53:52] branham look says now the only thing
[53:55] keeping you from your healing he said is
[53:57] a cloud of doubt that it's hanging over
[53:59] you
[54:00] whoa
[54:02] he even said it's that thin he calls it
[54:04] a thin crust
[54:07] he said that it's keeping
[54:08] paralyzed people from rising from their
[54:11] gods
[54:12] sick people with cancer that they would
[54:15] be completely healed in a moment's time
[54:18] the only thing the only thing that's
[54:21] keeping them from miracles is a thin
[54:24] layer of unbelief
[54:28] wow
[54:30] wow i wonder
[54:32] if we could look into that dimension and
[54:34] see what is clouding brother bram said
[54:36] you're clouded
[54:38] sometimes it was sickness sometimes it
[54:40] was unbelief or what it ever was
[54:44] but here mary did not accept the cloud
[54:48] mary began to create an atmosphere of
[54:52] thanksgiving
[54:54] because thanksgiving we can thank him
[54:56] for what he's done
[54:58] but real thanksgiving is faith
[55:02] that looks to what he is doing and what
[55:04] he will do it looks through the clouds
[55:07] into the sunshine and can say when i'm
[55:10] sick in my body and when i don't feel
[55:13] good that i am healed
[55:19] and we can thank god
[55:21] that our prayers are being answered
[55:25] right now that god is hearing our
[55:27] prayers right now god is moving upon my
[55:31] requests
[55:32] you must water the word of god
[55:36] with thanksgiving
[55:39] not and we have a lot to thank him for
[55:42] as far as earthly but we have a
[55:44] thanksgiving in the spirit that we call
[55:48] those things that are not as though they
[55:50] were
[55:53] and brother branham said the reason mary
[55:56] did what she did is because she was a
[55:58] seed of abraham
[56:00] and abraham his body was wore down his
[56:04] wife was wore down but god gave him a
[56:07] promise and no matter how many trembles
[56:10] how many how they felt how barren she
[56:13] was and friendless she was god's word
[56:16] was still true and god was still shining
[56:20] in his power and he called those things
[56:22] that were not as though they were and he
[56:25] praised god
[56:29] for the promise that was on its way
[56:33] hallelujah
[56:35] i'm
[56:36] thankful
[56:37] that god will never leave you nor
[56:39] forsake you
[56:40] thankful that he's bringing you to the
[56:42] full measure of christ
[56:44] how many are thankful that we are
[56:46] approaching the coming of the lord
[56:50] brother branham said the least faith
[56:53] that you feel in your heart you better
[56:54] start thanking him
[56:56] when you feel that little move upon your
[56:58] soul you need to thank god for it
[57:00] whatever you're laying claim of in the
[57:02] scriptures
[57:05] brother branham he told this woman he
[57:06] said come here sister if you believe
[57:08] with all your heart you have an awful
[57:10] trouble you're fighting every day
[57:11] hardest thing to get over his
[57:13] nervousness mental nervousness
[57:15] skipping down a little bit he said you
[57:17] got to get up here
[57:19] then you believe and you're well and you
[57:21] go
[57:22] you believe you're healed then act like
[57:24] it
[57:24] go thanking god
[57:27] don't speak any more of your nervousness
[57:30] don't accept nothing that the devil
[57:31] gives you you go on and you thank god
[57:35] amen
[57:37] how many members it was between the
[57:39] first and second poll
[57:42] brother branham speaks of a man
[57:45] that
[57:47] sold his
[57:48] cow
[57:49] drove 200 miles
[57:51] to bring his wife to brother branham
[57:54] and the woman was demon possessed
[57:57] took five men to get her into a car and
[57:59] she kicked out every window in the car
[58:02] and so they put her in a cellar and
[58:04] brother branham said i'll go see her so
[58:06] he went there
[58:07] and he said when he came down the steps
[58:09] i believe it was in a basement if i
[58:11] remember i'm pulling way back i didn't
[58:13] familiarize myself fully with the story
[58:16] but you remember the story
[58:18] but i thought i'll try to be as accurate
[58:20] as i remember
[58:21] he goes down and it called his name
[58:26] the demon called his name
[58:29] william branham have nothing to do with
[58:32] me
[58:32] something of that nature
[58:34] and brother branham said i went to take
[58:37] a hold of her hand
[58:38] and she grabbed him
[58:41] he said she was 10 times stronger
[58:44] than her normal self
[58:46] he said she would have threw me across
[58:48] the room had not i caught her chest with
[58:52] my foot
[58:53] and he said he yanked away
[58:55] jumped up on the stairs and he said it
[58:58] went on its back and began to push
[59:01] hissing
[59:02] and it began speaking it hit her head
[59:05] and knocked her scalp
[59:07] off like a piece of her head
[59:10] and
[59:11] the husband said i told you brother
[59:13] branham he said what do we do
[59:17] listen to this
[59:18] brother branham said it called my name
[59:22] he said
[59:23] she's never met me
[59:25] he said satan called my name
[59:28] listen to this he said because he
[59:30] recognizes god's gift
[59:33] and because of that she will be well
[59:37] he goes what do i do
[59:39] he said take her back to the institution
[59:42] and go thanking god for her healing
[59:50] a demon-possessed woman 10 times
[59:52] stronger
[59:55] and delivers her
[59:58] by watering the word of god
[1:00:02] the next day she came to herself and was
[1:00:05] released and they appeared three weeks
[1:00:07] later in a meeting and said she's
[1:00:08] completely healed
[1:00:12] there is a power in your thanksgiving
[1:00:16] we appreciate turkey and appreciate
[1:00:19] stuffing and all of that but let me tell
[1:00:20] you like brother aaron said this is
[1:00:22] turkey and stuffing that comes from
[1:00:24] heaven
[1:00:25] and i think we ought to eat ourselves
[1:00:27] fat
[1:00:28] i think we ought to eat on the word of
[1:00:30] god and give god thanks for the word
[1:00:33] this seven course meal of the message of
[1:00:36] the hour
[1:00:37] that tells us how to conduct ourselves
[1:00:40] and how to live hallelujah
[1:00:44] you know listen to this brother branham
[1:00:46] said
[1:00:47] brother branham said now in this great
[1:00:49] room where the power of god is bottled
[1:00:52] down
[1:00:53] satan cannot stand where faith is
[1:00:57] no more than a person can exist where
[1:01:00] tear gas is falling
[1:01:03] that's a direct quote
[1:01:06] see because in the meetings you would
[1:01:08] see darkness collect and begin to fight
[1:01:11] and that's why you see epilepsy epilepsy
[1:01:13] cancer cancer you see they they unite
[1:01:16] they're kindred
[1:01:17] but then brother branham as soon as he
[1:01:19] preached the word faith would begin to
[1:01:20] unite
[1:01:21] and when faith began to unite and live
[1:01:24] satan was powerless he said and satan
[1:01:27] cannot stand in the presence of your
[1:01:29] faith
[1:01:30] no more than if we put tear gas in this
[1:01:33] room it would make every one of us leave
[1:01:36] and in the presence of your face say my
[1:01:39] faith in the presence of your faith
[1:01:42] demon powers must scatter as the son of
[1:01:45] righteousness arises with healing in his
[1:01:48] wings and the power and glory of god
[1:01:51] shine upon his congregation
[1:01:56] he is still shining right now
[1:01:59] in your life in your church in your
[1:02:01] situation in your sickness in your trial
[1:02:04] he is shining right now
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:10] don't that make you feel good
[1:02:12] as long as there is a forever
[1:02:14] he is still shining
[1:02:17] how many say lord i'd like to see a
[1:02:18] revival in my life
[1:02:21] i'd like to come out of my negativity
[1:02:24] i like to come out of my criticisms i've
[1:02:26] gotten hard on god i want to soften up i
[1:02:29] don't want to feel this way i want to
[1:02:31] break the ice and break off this
[1:02:33] heaviness that hangs over me i'm a child
[1:02:36] of god i have been called predestinated
[1:02:39] to this hour i thank god for my calling
[1:02:42] how many can say thank you lord

[1:02:47] thank you lord for healing my body thank
[1:02:50] you lord for the revelation of the holy
[1:02:52] spirit
[1:02:54] i think we ought to be a happy people
[1:02:57] i think we ought to water the word of
[1:02:59] god with our praises and i think we
[1:03:01] ought to make the devil feel real
[1:03:03] uncomfortable in services like this
[1:03:06] i think we ought to amen the word of god
[1:03:10] i think we ought to shout and say god be
[1:03:12] praised he's a living god he's mighty in
[1:03:15] battle and the devil ain't got a chance
[1:03:20] the devil ain't got a chance and he
[1:03:21] knows it
[1:03:23] you have an atonement between you and
[1:03:26] the devil
[1:03:27] he has no right in this church he has no
[1:03:30] right in your life

[1:03:33] for his shielding power
[1:03:36] the same holy ghost that shielded john
[1:03:39] in that hot oil is the same holy ghost
[1:03:41] that shields us

[1:03:54] i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
