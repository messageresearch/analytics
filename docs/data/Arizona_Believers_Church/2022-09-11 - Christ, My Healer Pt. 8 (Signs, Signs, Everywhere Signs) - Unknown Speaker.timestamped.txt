[0:00] a few statements just to point back to
[0:02] where we were last time this is part
[0:03] eight on christ my healer
[0:05] i have been laying a foundation through
[0:07] these first eight services i could
[0:09] continue to do so i think in perpetuity
[0:12] so just today i'm desiring just the end
[0:14] off on the on the foundation if there's
[0:16] any more foundational things i'll shove
[0:18] it off to maybe another series and we
[0:20] want to uh maybe get into the aspects of
[0:23] divine healing but last time we looked
[0:25] at the subject of elevated faith and we
[0:27] saw how
[0:29] this elevated faith uh is connected with
[0:32] divine healing and so we kind of
[0:33] connected divine healing to the rapture
[0:35] or
[0:36] one way i think of really looking at it
[0:38] is the death of christ the shedding of
[0:40] his blood purchased our salvation and
[0:42] full salvation
[0:44] is more than i'm saved i'm forgiven or
[0:47] just even how we use those terminologies
[0:49] sometimes to refer to something they're
[0:51] not but it re the fullness of salvation
[0:54] is not just to live a christian life and
[0:55] then go to a grave but the fullness of
[0:57] salvation
[0:58] is full redemption and so divine healing
[1:01] is kind of that forward-looking signal
[1:03] that there's more to this there's more
[1:05] to this there is a change of the body a
[1:07] redemption of the body the fullness of
[1:09] salvation and so in connecting divine
[1:12] healing to that we saw plainly
[1:14] in the word how that the message is
[1:17] trying to elevate our faith and not only
[1:19] how but the why
[1:21] the message is trying to elevate our
[1:23] faith to believe the word only amen
[1:26] that's what brother branham is never
[1:28] dismissive about uh laying on of hands
[1:31] anointing with oil these things that are
[1:33] very scriptural but we do see this theme
[1:35] that brother branham was wanting to
[1:36] establish those things allow god to
[1:39] operate in those things but then use
[1:41] those as kind of building blocks or
[1:43] stepping stones into an elevated faith
[1:45] to where in our maturity we take god at
[1:48] his word and we don't have to revisit
[1:51] some of the elementary things or the
[1:53] fundamental things but built up in these
[1:55] things we come to a place of perfect
[1:57] faith and so divine healing
[2:00] uh is in divine healing and coming to
[2:02] this uh elevated faith we come to this
[2:05] time god meets us time and time again
[2:08] through the uh the repetition of his
[2:10] word and the daily acts of faith where
[2:12] finally we come to the place where even
[2:13] in divine healing we can take god at his
[2:15] word and that's an elevated faith
[2:18] and it's not to say that someone does
[2:19] not have faith in any other area but
[2:22] it's just kind of instructional uh to
[2:24] get us to this place where we can
[2:26] rise up to the level that we ought to be
[2:28] at
[2:29] and i hadn't uh really considered
[2:31] sharing this part at all and so maybe
[2:33] you're just all getting giddy with
[2:35] excitement but i will admit that in the
[2:38] past in in approaching this subject and
[2:40] through the many years of ministry and
[2:42] not very long i'm still considering
[2:43] myself very young in ministry
[2:45] you could take these things i mean that
[2:47] and and you could take these things and
[2:50] present them in a way to where you're
[2:52] really not doing yourself any favors
[2:53] because the critics are immediately
[2:55] going to say oh they're against divine
[2:56] healing they're against laying on of
[2:57] hands they're against prayer lines
[2:59] and and and i realized that some of the
[3:02] things that brother branham says are
[3:04] very instruct or probably more for the
[3:06] minister to consider and to take in
[3:08] consideration and be informed by than
[3:11] necessarily presenting them to the
[3:13] people because there's a way that you
[3:15] could present these things to the people
[3:16] and they go to the extremes oh well we
[3:18] don't believe in altar calls and we
[3:20] don't believe in the gifts and we don't
[3:21] believe in laying on of hands and so
[3:23] really in some ways it's more
[3:25] informative to the man of god and the
[3:26] minister to realize
[3:28] that in what you emphasize and how you
[3:30] take people's faith and you grow it and
[3:32] you build it that you're always
[3:34] conscious and aware that there's an
[3:35] ultimate and so you use things in such a
[3:38] way in the word of god to bring them to
[3:40] a place of an ultimate
[3:42] and and that's kind of what's informing
[3:43] you in the background and so i actually
[3:47] even at one time it kind of purposed in
[3:48] my heart maybe never to deal with these
[3:50] things again
[3:52] over the pulpit but god just over the
[3:54] last couple months just opening things
[3:56] up more and more to me where i realized
[3:58] wow there's just so much more to it
[4:00] where it doesn't need to get into that
[4:01] realm of sides and this this camp and
[4:04] that camp that it really it's a
[4:05] beautiful thing for all of us to be
[4:07] fully aware of that this is what god is
[4:09] doing in my life this is how all these
[4:11] things work together and he's using them
[4:13] to build my faith not kind of just
[4:15] create a little bit of a dynamic that i
[4:17] always live within but to grow me to a
[4:19] place of perfection
[4:21] and so my title today is sign signs
[4:24] everywhere signs
[4:26] and
[4:27] that's my title
[4:29] and it may seem a little bit eye-catchy
[4:31] just that uh that sign there but
[4:35] my kind of my thesis is what i'm wanting
[4:37] to look at and i think this fits in with
[4:39] these other seven parts is now when it
[4:41] comes to the things of god we're wanting
[4:42] to remove the noise
[4:45] and all the distractions so that we kind
[4:47] of catch the signal or follow the signal
[4:49] to the word
[4:51] because the word is the ultimate and
[4:53] there's a lot of things that around the
[4:55] world that create the noise and it could
[4:57] actually be kind of the word
[4:59] that is giving rise to it brother iran
[5:01] said wherever god is there's a lot of
[5:02] noise
[5:04] and we can use those quotes to really
[5:06] drum up a really nice worship service
[5:08] right wherever christ is there's a lot
[5:09] of noise but wouldn't it be a shame if
[5:11] in all the noise you never heard them
[5:14] of all the noise you never got to them
[5:15] you just kind of get caught up in the
[5:16] peripheral
[5:18] enthusiasm of something and even when
[5:21] elijah was in the cave there were signs
[5:23] signs everywhere signs but where was he
[5:25] found he was in that voice and so those
[5:28] when the lord passed by he was known in
[5:30] some of the more visible things but
[5:32] ultimately it was that voice that spoke
[5:34] to his heart so kind of what we're
[5:36] wanting to do and if i can't remember to
[5:38] come back to this to remember today in
[5:39] this title sign signs everywhere signs
[5:43] is what the
[5:44] we mentioned before signs are pointing
[5:46] to something
[5:47] and that with all the with all the noise
[5:50] can i actually follow the signal back to
[5:53] the source
[5:54] and find the through this beacon find
[5:56] where i need to be
[5:58] and so in mark chapter 16 i'm not going
[6:01] to read the whole passage again
[6:04] but we know that jesus gives the great
[6:06] commission
[6:07] and he is telling him to go into all the
[6:09] world and preach the gospel we can
[6:11] almost say just as he outlines it in
[6:13] matthew that that is the commission go
[6:16] into all the world and preach the gospel
[6:18] commanding people everywhere to obey to
[6:21] to follow the things which i have
[6:22] commanded you teaching them to observe
[6:24] all things which i have told you to do
[6:27] and then he says he that believes that
[6:29] is baptized shall be saved he that
[6:30] believes not
[6:32] it shall be damned and so faith is the
[6:34] ultimate not even the baptism uh because
[6:37] if you don't believe and are baptized
[6:39] that doesn't change anything so
[6:41] preaching the word and believing is the
[6:43] ultimate
[6:44] and and then he gives he kind of elicits
[6:46] these signs shall follow them that
[6:48] believe we'll come to that here in a
[6:49] moment
[6:50] but if i could put it this way and these
[6:52] are just my words it's kind of the order
[6:54] of the great commission and this is a
[6:56] commission that the church is still
[6:57] under
[6:58] and they are commissioned to preach
[7:00] christ to the world
[7:02] and so in the way that christ outlines
[7:04] it
[7:05] it's very easy first kind of i think
[7:07] it's very easy for us to identify this
[7:08] that hearing the word is the original
[7:10] way to receive faith because that's the
[7:12] way christ says it in in his
[7:14] introduction preach the word he that
[7:15] believeth shall be saved
[7:17] and then the way he orders it is once
[7:20] the word is preached and there's faith
[7:21] then the signs follow so it kind of
[7:24] catch the order there's a formula the
[7:26] word first faith then signs
[7:29] and and that pattern that has to be the
[7:31] pattern
[7:32] uh the signs don't interrupt that
[7:34] pattern or shouldn't interrupt that
[7:35] pattern
[7:36] and so the signs which follow the
[7:38] believer
[7:40] confirm the word
[7:43] it confirms the very promise and it's
[7:45] confirmation
[7:46] to the doubter to the sinner to the
[7:49] observer to believe the word that was
[7:51] preached
[7:52] in order to be saved
[7:54] so it doesn't become a spin-off where
[7:56] you preach the word and there's faith
[7:59] and then there's signs and then what
[8:00] could happen is people can gravitate to
[8:03] the sign and this is really just laying
[8:04] out the blueprint for the the
[8:06] breadcrumbs for today they can gravitate
[8:08] to the signs but what what what gave
[8:11] rise to the sign
[8:13] let's back up it was the word in faith
[8:15] that produced the signs and there's
[8:17] something tricky about uh human behavior
[8:20] and and about that process to where all
[8:22] now all of a sudden you get you get
[8:24] caught up in the cause and effect and
[8:26] you're you're focusing in on the sign
[8:28] but god gives those signs by his grace
[8:31] to compel the doubter or the sinner or
[8:33] the one who's struggling to come back to
[8:36] the word in order to have faith
[8:39] and so that i think that even if you can
[8:41] kind of imagine that that's really where
[8:43] my mind what i'm wanting to lay out
[8:46] because ultimately
[8:48] uh the believer even and go into all the
[8:50] world preach the gospel he that
[8:52] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[8:53] that believer does not need signs to
[8:55] believe
[8:57] it says preach the word
[8:59] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[9:01] be saved this is independent apart from
[9:03] any subsequent manifestation of the
[9:05] gifts at all it's manifestation of the
[9:06] spirit preach the word believe and you
[9:09] shall be saved so that believer does not
[9:11] need the signs to believe nor do they
[9:14] need the signs to continue to believe
[9:17] because in a way not in a way but
[9:19] there's absolutely if you turn to
[9:20] ephesians chapter one their faith is
[9:22] sealed
[9:23] and notice how paul outlines this
[9:25] ephesians chapter 1 verses 12 to 14 that
[9:28] we should be to the praise of his glory
[9:30] who first trusted in christ here's the
[9:32] real
[9:33] heart of this in whom ye also trusted
[9:35] christ you trusted
[9:37] after that you heard the word of truth
[9:38] so you trusted you believed you put your
[9:40] confidence in him how did you put your
[9:42] confidence in after you heard the word
[9:45] of truth that's god's program that's
[9:46] god's way
[9:47] the gospel of your salvation and this is
[9:50] really harkens right back to the great
[9:52] commission after you heard the word of
[9:53] truth which is the gospel in whom also
[9:56] after that ye believed you were sealed
[9:58] with that holy spirit of promise he that
[10:01] heareth the word and believeth shall be
[10:04] saved he's sealed with the holy spirit
[10:06] of promise which is the earnest of our
[10:08] inheritance until the redemption of the
[10:09] purchased possession under the praise of
[10:12] his glory so paul is going back and
[10:15] following this pattern of the commission
[10:17] you heard the gospel of your salvation
[10:19] which is the word of truth and that is
[10:22] what you believed and then after you
[10:24] believed you were sealed with the holy
[10:25] spirit of promise
[10:27] and so faith the baptismal holy ghost is
[10:30] a seal of your faith
[10:32] let's let's be very very careful to
[10:34] never misconstrue the message of the
[10:37] hour or
[10:38] the word of god to say that the baptism
[10:40] of the holy ghost is the seal of your
[10:43] discipline
[10:44] the seal of your good works or the seal
[10:47] of your training and or the seal of your
[10:49] understanding it is a seal of your faith
[10:52] and so too he that heareth and believeth
[10:55] is sealed with the holy ghost and then
[10:57] that seal is sure and now you don't need
[10:59] any more signs
[11:02] now in reality you don't need any more
[11:05] signs to be any more saved or any more
[11:07] sealed
[11:08] but still in this world in this flesh
[11:11] there's a way that our minds and even
[11:12] our bodies can kind of signal to us oh i
[11:15] need more i need more but the reality of
[11:17] it is in your soul
[11:19] and what we want to do is never lose
[11:20] contact with that
[11:22] because there's a there's a deity in you
[11:25] at the time that you were sealed wow
[11:27] it's beautiful
[11:29] the deity part not just what i said the
[11:31] deity part inside of you i'm not over
[11:33] here saying nice to my own sermons
[11:37] yeah
[11:37] and brother branham
[11:40] and i'm just going to kind of pepper
[11:41] through the sermon some statements just
[11:43] kind of one-liners that brother brown
[11:44] makes won't necessarily have everything
[11:46] on a slide but i really want you to
[11:48] hopefully just mentally grab a hold of
[11:51] some of these things and not maybe get
[11:52] distracted by the slides but in
[11:54] referring to these signs shall fall them
[11:56] that believe brother branham says mark
[11:58] 16 said these things shall follow them
[12:00] that believe
[12:01] if the church preaches different from
[12:03] that don't you
[12:05] you die to that thing
[12:07] be born again into the word of god
[12:10] so if there's a church that teaches
[12:12] different preachers different from these
[12:15] signs shall fall then that belief he's
[12:17] saying don't you preach that or don't
[12:18] you maybe it's just a fragment but he
[12:20] says you die to that thing and be born
[12:22] again into the word of god indicating
[12:24] that that kind of teaching will actually
[12:27] keep you from being birthed into the
[12:29] word of god because it creates a
[12:31] separate false paradigm
[12:34] that god's not working within and you're
[12:36] constantly seeking the holy ghost
[12:37] constantly seeking the holy ghost and
[12:39] the holy ghost is kind of presented to
[12:40] you as like a carrot being dangled oh
[12:42] you better you you're not going to get
[12:44] the seal until you prove yourself and
[12:46] you're not going to get it till you do
[12:47] this until you do that and you're you're
[12:49] kind of in this uh
[12:51] this a whole nother arena where god's
[12:53] not and he's calling you by grace no
[12:55] come over here to where you can believe
[12:57] all things are possible
[12:58] and saying all right come over here
[13:00] because all you got to do is believe the
[13:02] word
[13:03] and these signs shall follow them that
[13:04] believe but it's amazing
[13:06] how intellectual you can get to say oh
[13:08] no no just the word only and then find
[13:10] yourself in a camp where you don't
[13:12] believe the word can do anything all
[13:13] right
[13:14] it's really remarkable he says you died
[13:16] of that thing
[13:17] brother branham and the sermon ashamed
[13:19] we provided this one now we notice today
[13:21] if somebody says are you a christian
[13:23] it's very much a popular thing to say oh
[13:25] i'm a christian
[13:27] but do you believe the word of god where
[13:30] it said these signs shall follow them
[13:31] that believe
[13:33] oh even ministers faces will blush
[13:38] are you ashamed of say of divine healing
[13:42] are you ashamed of the full gospel
[13:45] are you ashamed of your
[13:47] experience
[13:49] that's being ashamed of his word
[13:52] that
[13:53] his word made flesh in you
[13:57] so the word made flesh in you divine
[13:59] healing
[14:00] the full gospel a pentecostal experience
[14:02] i believe we should understand these in
[14:04] light of how brother branham places them
[14:07] and not in somebody else's
[14:09] the super duper divine healing or some
[14:11] other fantastic that may be out there
[14:13] but these signs shall follow them that
[14:15] believe the full gospel divine healing
[14:16] the pentecostal experience he says if
[14:18] you're ashamed of that you're ashamed of
[14:20] his word that's his word made flashing
[14:22] you
[14:24] so there's there's a lot there's a lot
[14:26] in the message of the hour from 47 all
[14:29] the way believe it or not past the seals
[14:31] through 65 where brother brahms never
[14:34] taking the signs and saying up days of
[14:36] miracles are passed the the apostolic
[14:38] order his uh the apostolic doctrine has
[14:40] ceased and we kind of entered into a
[14:42] different kind of cultish area where we
[14:44] come up with our own ideas no he's kept
[14:47] these things very much alive and well
[14:49] because it was part of god's program to
[14:51] see us to full salvation
[14:54] and so mark chapter 16 verse
[14:58] verse 17
[15:00] and i think i hope i have uh yeah i have
[15:02] the 18 there i just don't have the slide
[15:04] uh accurately depicted there mark
[15:06] chapter 16 verses 17
[15:08] and 18. these signs shall follow them
[15:11] that
[15:12] believe
[15:14] them that believe the word and are
[15:15] baptized in jesus name these signs shall
[15:18] follow them what are these signs these
[15:19] are the five signs in my name they shall
[15:22] cast out devils
[15:24] they shall speak with new tongues
[15:27] they shall take up serpents
[15:29] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[15:32] not hurt them
[15:33] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[15:35] they shall recover
[15:37] these are the signs these are five signs
[15:40] that jesus defended definitively says
[15:43] will follow them that believe
[15:46] so these are more when it says they
[15:47] follow think of a more of like kind of
[15:49] the after effects or the the byproduct
[15:52] of kind of the things that are produced
[15:53] from the word and faith they come
[15:56] afterwards
[15:57] and so these things are following the
[15:59] believer and we know we heard it said
[16:00] the believers doesn't follow it but they
[16:01] follow the believer but they're casting
[16:04] out devils in the name of jesus christ
[16:05] they're speaking with new tongues they
[16:07] take up serpents
[16:09] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[16:11] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[16:12] sick and they shall recover
[16:15] now these are the signs that christ said
[16:18] will follow them that believe
[16:20] but looking at it on its face we realize
[16:23] that
[16:24] we have to be very careful to what
[16:26] extent just how far we take these signs
[16:30] and what we use them to be conclusive of
[16:32] because if we say these signs shall fall
[16:34] them that believe they shall take up
[16:36] serpents and then all we've got to do is
[16:38] go out there and grab a snake
[16:41] right
[16:42] or all we'd have and i i had the thought
[16:45] to bring
[16:46] a box and and have something that may
[16:49] seem like a snake
[16:50] and present it to somebody and have it
[16:52] kind of flying out
[16:54] i think you all have heard my snake
[16:55] story so i thought better of that
[16:57] i know what it means to be snake bit
[17:00] but we could kind of produce this
[17:02] self-confirming evidence by just passing
[17:04] out snakes
[17:06] and then if we get bit just saying see
[17:08] you're not going to die right you're
[17:09] doing good everybody's fine and then if
[17:11] we survive the snake bite we've come up
[17:13] with kind of this this evidence by
[17:16] virtue of this sign that see we've got
[17:18] it
[17:19] we're
[17:20] we are the believers that jesus spoke of
[17:21] in mark chapter 16 and we do it by snake
[17:24] handling
[17:25] anybody here from carolina
[17:27] you ever been in a snake handling church
[17:29] they got them
[17:31] they're out there and they really hyper
[17:33] focus on this particular aspect and
[17:36] they've turned this kind of into an
[17:37] evidence because it kind of reads they
[17:39] shall take up deadly serpents and they
[17:41] won't harm them they shall drink deadly
[17:42] things and it won't harm them and so
[17:44] there's a way that carnally you could
[17:46] say well if this is the sign i believe
[17:48] that i'm gonna drink a deadly poison and
[17:50] if i live that shows that i believed or
[17:53] i'm gonna handle these snakes and if i
[17:55] get bitten don't die then that shows i'm
[17:57] a believer so i i think you can look at
[18:00] this and recognize as brother matthew
[18:02] watkins put it there's kind of these
[18:04] ditches that you have to avoid in this
[18:06] in this way
[18:08] and to stay balanced because there's a
[18:10] way that these things can be manipulated
[18:13] or abused
[18:15] brother branham speaking of these signs
[18:16] says we should not seek after them
[18:20] but god gives them and i'm saying a lot
[18:22] of these statements to stay balanced
[18:25] that's his grace he gives them so we
[18:28] shouldn't seek after them but god gives
[18:30] them by his grace he says we go to
[18:32] seeking after them then that's wrong but
[18:35] when he just gives them by his grace
[18:37] that's wonderful
[18:38] in that isn't that a beautiful balance
[18:41] i'm just going to trust god i'm going to
[18:42] believe his word i'm going to die to any
[18:44] idea that tells me that the gifts don't
[18:45] work and there's nothing to this and
[18:47] there's nothing to that but i'm just
[18:48] going to stay focused on his word i'm
[18:49] not going to try to manufacture anything
[18:51] or drum up anything and i'm just going
[18:53] to believe his word and then he says if
[18:55] god gives him that's wonderful and
[18:56] that's still his grace but our mindset
[18:59] is i don't need to look any further than
[19:02] his word and this very real revelation i
[19:06] have of his word to believe these things
[19:09] when i say these things it's christ not
[19:11] necessarily the signs
[19:13] it's kind of the the misnomer
[19:15] that and i remember in the very
[19:16] beginning in the very genesis before uh
[19:19] the website believed the sign was even
[19:21] published i sat down with the the
[19:23] brothers who had the burden in their
[19:24] heart to do it and they spent a lot of
[19:27] time explaining me what they were trying
[19:28] to do and their objective behind it
[19:30] asked me to write for it and be a part
[19:32] of it and their whole idea was that you
[19:34] would believe the sign
[19:37] and their their their desire was to
[19:39] definitively prove without any doubt
[19:41] scientifically historically uh
[19:44] geographically and everything else the
[19:46] truth of the message
[19:48] right
[19:50] and so it just in its genesis it was
[19:53] just a little bit off-kilter
[19:56] so then and really i say this with
[19:58] respect you should it should help us to
[20:01] understand why someone who's who's
[20:03] driven by that would come to a place a
[20:06] little bit of disenchantment
[20:08] and kind of become
[20:12] come to a place of doubting when it
[20:13] comes to the message of the hour because
[20:15] they set out to do something you can't
[20:17] do
[20:18] and they wanted to definitively do
[20:20] something that god's never asked us
[20:22] necessarily to do to just kind of
[20:23] worship and believe the sign
[20:25] it's to believe the word
[20:27] and so i i'm in some ways i'm
[20:30] sympathetic to their plight because i
[20:31] realize it was wrong and it's beginning
[20:34] and that's why they find themselves
[20:35] where they are now god have mercy on
[20:37] them
[20:39] i i think if i could even say this
[20:41] there's a lot of insincerity associated
[20:43] with it many times
[20:44] a lot of intentional personal baggage
[20:47] and vendettas
[20:49] but be very careful in your attitude
[20:51] towards people who doubt who don't
[20:52] believe
[20:53] who who are even very critical uh many
[20:56] times if you if you take a look at what
[20:58] they've gone through you could realize
[21:00] why they've ended up where they were and
[21:02] i just say god have mercy on them
[21:05] and they're actually good people
[21:06] wonderful people that you would enjoy
[21:08] fellowshipping with that have found
[21:10] themselves very hurt or uh kind of
[21:12] discombobulated when it comes to certain
[21:14] things about the message
[21:16] did we edit that out is that is that
[21:18] still in
[21:20] so brother brad is saying that we should
[21:21] not seek after the signs
[21:24] so we do not seek signs
[21:27] because if we seek signs it places the
[21:30] signs ahead of the word
[21:33] and and and in doing so kind of upsets
[21:35] god's god's order we go back to the
[21:37] great commission in god's order if we
[21:39] start seeking the signs brother man says
[21:41] they're wonderful when god gives them so
[21:43] when we see the signs we're not like
[21:45] right
[21:46] we don't like oh there's nothing to that
[21:48] we wonderful
[21:50] god gives them isn't that wonderful but
[21:52] we don't start chasing after them and
[21:54] seeking them we just kind of rest and we
[21:56] say this is wonderful this is great
[21:57] however god uses them we receive them
[22:00] and we are blessed by them we revert our
[22:02] focus back to the word and we don't seek
[22:04] the signs because then if you seek the
[22:06] signs it's the signs that get ahead of
[22:08] you and have the preeminence instead of
[22:10] the word coming first and faith being
[22:12] birthed by that and that will never get
[22:14] you to redemption
[22:16] it's never going to grow your faith
[22:17] it'll actually disappoint your faith
[22:22] brother braham says remember he said
[22:23] that this is just referring to mark
[22:25] chapter 16 these signs shall fall in the
[22:27] belief remember he said that that has to
[22:30] be he would not have said that unless
[22:32] there was going to be somebody who could
[22:33] catch that word
[22:36] so it's in the word he said it
[22:39] and he would not have said it if there
[22:40] wasn't somebody who is going to uh be
[22:43] able to catch the word by virtue of
[22:45] those things so we don't
[22:46] and again i'm trying to stay very very
[22:48] balanced especially in the outset
[22:50] so that we don't we don't deviate from
[22:52] this course that these are god-given
[22:54] things
[22:55] and seeking after signs may lead to
[22:57] signs
[22:59] just as you mentioned kind of the
[23:00] self-confirming self-fulfilling prophecy
[23:02] i prophesy that i'm in a i'm going to
[23:05] slap
[23:06] chase
[23:07] right
[23:09] guess who's listening now
[23:11] i could prophesy that right
[23:14] and it would be really easy for it to
[23:15] come to pass and say bless god i'm a
[23:17] prophet
[23:18] right
[23:19] this is kind of
[23:20] self-fulfilling so seeking after signs
[23:23] may lead to more signs but it won't
[23:24] necessarily lead to more faith
[23:27] because this is where i referred to it
[23:28] and i didn't necessarily like the
[23:30] specific language of it because maybe
[23:33] from
[23:34] an academic or scientific even a
[23:36] business standpoint there's maybe more
[23:37] to it and it may be very easy for people
[23:39] to get very quickly into the weeds but i
[23:42] referred to as a feed that feedback loop
[23:45] and a feedback loop i was kind of just
[23:46] thinking where there's an output that
[23:48] just keeps it just the out it just keeps
[23:50] circling around
[23:52] and it just generates maybe more of an
[23:54] audio loop would be what we'd be
[23:56] thinking of to where it just generates
[23:57] this buzz or this sound where it's like
[24:01] is that what it even was to begin with
[24:03] and so i think this may be a good spot
[24:05] to use this first slide
[24:08] um and i'll try maybe to use this
[24:10] this is very rudimentary and i know some
[24:12] of you graphic designers are scoffing at
[24:14] this
[24:16] and no it wasn't like a take on the
[24:18] amazon logo i just realized that kind of
[24:19] after the fact
[24:21] and um
[24:22] uh thank you jeff for the uh permission
[24:25] to use your logo
[24:27] i i don't know if he streams but if he
[24:29] streams
[24:30] he's not tithing i can tell you that
[24:32] much
[24:36] but
[24:37] what ought to be this is the order
[24:41] i'm speaking to you brother bezos
[24:45] this is the original formula the word
[24:48] and i'm kind of looping pointing to
[24:50] faith
[24:51] and when the word has given rise to
[24:53] faith faith looks back to the word
[24:56] faith cometh by hearing the word of god
[24:58] so the word first faith is gen born and
[25:01] then faith knows whose its daddy is so
[25:03] it looks right back to the word
[25:05] like this is what faith this word comes
[25:08] faith faith always goes back to the word
[25:10] because that's what it's based on it's
[25:12] the only thing it'll feed it you could
[25:13] draw this out within the the temple of
[25:15] the body we have the soul and then there
[25:17] is the sense to those who are born again
[25:19] is the sense of faith it's the sixth
[25:21] sense it's the only thing that resides
[25:23] there the only thing that can reach that
[25:24] is the word
[25:26] and so when that comes in what is it
[25:27] that comes comes back out what's to come
[25:29] but come back out to him be protected to
[25:31] the word
[25:33] so faith has to be something that's
[25:34] directed towards it comes back to the
[25:36] word now kind of the
[25:38] offshoot of that are signs
[25:41] in this dynamic of the word faith and
[25:44] this kind of this dynamo i reached out
[25:46] to brother lucas yesterday because he he
[25:48] has a gift of
[25:50] of taking things and presenting things
[25:52] visually and even taking maybe complex
[25:54] thoughts and processes uh and he does a
[25:57] lot of teaching in his professional life
[25:59] and so i kind of just called him up to
[26:01] kind of spit ball and that was kind of
[26:03] maybe the way he even described it when
[26:04] i first mentioned it to him it's kind of
[26:06] like this dynamo that one just works
[26:07] against the other you think about that
[26:08] creates an energy right this this these
[26:11] forces working it gets going and it's
[26:13] never going to stop this eternal dynamo
[26:15] and kind of what's going to radiate from
[26:17] that are signs
[26:19] but where the power is is in the word
[26:21] faith dynamic
[26:23] what the byproduct is are signs
[26:26] right
[26:28] kind of like what they do is they um
[26:30] they're trying to produce these nuclear
[26:31] plants their goal is to produce waste
[26:34] and the byproduct is energy
[26:37] see what i did there
[26:39] and uh thank you
[26:40] and
[26:41] so this is the word this is that this is
[26:44] the dynamic and then signs follow signs
[26:46] follow but the real heart of it is in
[26:48] this word and faith relationship and so
[26:51] that would be god's formula that would
[26:53] be god's original desire there'll be all
[26:55] the things we've said through these
[26:56] several parts is that faith comes by the
[26:59] word that is what faith looks back to
[27:02] and the signs are the byproduct not the
[27:04] objective
[27:06] so word comes to faith faith then
[27:08] produces these signs and then and the
[27:11] the dynamic present then faith now isn't
[27:14] looking
[27:15] looking to the signs
[27:17] or is not toward the sign nothing
[27:19] nothing in this whole formula changes
[27:22] and so in that the signs are not the
[27:24] objective your faith is the objective of
[27:27] the word
[27:28] right this is signs come by hearing
[27:31] hearing by the word of god it's not the
[27:32] signs but faith does
[27:35] now in this other formula
[27:37] i think i kind of thought of in my mind
[27:39] kind of is the deceptive formula or the
[27:41] bezos formula
[27:43] is the
[27:44] the idea that you have over in this one
[27:47] side if you can see the in in the
[27:49] left-hand corner of that dynamic word
[27:52] faith word faith what is it going to
[27:53] spin off it's going to spin off signs
[27:55] but a whole nother
[27:57] dynamo starts
[27:59] or something kind of spins off of that
[28:02] dynamic because they're signs and that
[28:05] produces this loop of signs point to
[28:08] signs point back to signs point to signs
[28:11] point back to signs and it just gets
[28:13] going and it gets its own momentum
[28:16] and that can happen independent of this
[28:19] this other dynamic of the word in faith
[28:23] and the way that brother lucas had drawn
[28:25] it out is on the inside there is the
[28:27] word faith and then there's this outer
[28:29] ring of signs
[28:31] and and that that you could actually
[28:34] have the outer ring of signs but never
[28:35] have the inner ring of word and faith
[28:39] because all we'd have to do is pass out
[28:40] snakes every sunday think of how packed
[28:43] we'd be
[28:45] not hardly
[28:47] but you'd have the signs right
[28:49] and look how powerful we are signs point
[28:51] to signs point to signs and then you
[28:53] need it every service
[28:55] right
[28:56] we this is where brother branham says
[28:58] you can't can't hardly have a meeting
[28:59] without divine healing
[29:01] right is because that's what you look to
[29:03] and it's not really faith anymore
[29:05] because faith is starving just give me
[29:06] the word just give me the word but it's
[29:08] that sign part feeding back into signs
[29:11] feeding back into signs
[29:13] and so in this
[29:15] it's very easy for you to visually see
[29:16] this where's the problem is it's bypass
[29:19] the word
[29:21] and since it's bypassed the word it
[29:23] can't produce faith
[29:25] it just points to itself
[29:28] and it becomes circular reasoning
[29:30] how do you know your sign is right
[29:32] because it produced it produces signs
[29:34] well how do you know your signs are
[29:35] right because it produces signs signs
[29:38] and this is where using the example of
[29:40] the an audio feedback and i don't have a
[29:43] chart for this but i think this can just
[29:44] kind of signify it for you know you can
[29:46] keep that up there bill john
[29:48] is in this you have an audio feedback is
[29:51] there signal and i don't know that i
[29:53] want to produce it because it can be
[29:54] very grating and irritating
[29:56] but how many have ever heard audio
[29:57] feedback right here in this church bless
[30:00] god
[30:02] a signal my voice or
[30:04] a voice is basically because a signal to
[30:07] a microphone
[30:08] which is then amplified and sent through
[30:10] a speaker right that's how it should be
[30:12] there's there's some signal even if
[30:14] there's no voice that the microphone is
[30:16] going to be sending the signal
[30:18] to which is amplified and then pushed
[30:20] out through speakers i should i could
[30:22] just do this here pushed out through
[30:23] speakers or a speaker and then what
[30:26] happens is when that comes out of the
[30:29] speaker
[30:30] and the microphone picks it back up it
[30:33] creates a loop
[30:35] you ever ever looked at a mirror in a
[30:36] mirror
[30:38] right and it creates that image it's
[30:40] very fascinating the younger you are and
[30:42] it creates that image and and that's
[30:44] kind of like a feedback loop it's it's
[30:46] mirroring a mirror mirror mirror it
[30:47] seems like it goes on forever so what
[30:48] happens is when this signal is amplified
[30:51] and pushed out to the speaker and then
[30:52] it comes back to the same as the input
[30:56] it was the output you're hearing me
[30:59] was the output now it becomes the input
[31:02] and that's where it begins to get to the
[31:03] point where it's uh
[31:06] and it doesn't mean anything anymore
[31:08] it can sound really good in some types
[31:09] of music if you like that
[31:11] but you've got to be able to use it
[31:13] correctly right
[31:14] and so in this way it's not desirable at
[31:17] all because think about it you can get
[31:19] that loop without any voice
[31:23] that's right
[31:24] and what happens is the voice can speak
[31:27] it gets amplified sent out through the
[31:30] speaker and without ever speaking again
[31:32] it gets right back into the channel and
[31:35] that becomes the source and it just
[31:36] creates its own dynamo and you get to
[31:39] wear have you ever done it played it
[31:40] with your phones you call someone on
[31:42] another phone there in the room with you
[31:43] and you go hello hello hello hello and
[31:46] it starts going
[31:49] that's the feedback loop you can't hear
[31:50] hello anymore
[31:52] the original voice the original spoken
[31:54] word it's lost
[31:56] but it's there's this feedback that
[31:58] keeps going through and it's all by a
[31:59] signal
[32:01] now that's exactly what a sign is
[32:04] a sign in the bible even this word
[32:06] that's used here
[32:08] in
[32:09] uh in mark chapter 16 sign is translated
[32:11] to miracle wonder or even token
[32:15] and in that way we could think of a
[32:17] signed post or something that brother
[32:19] ran talks about the sign to
[32:20] jeffersonville
[32:21] and these are the definitions of a sign
[32:23] a mark
[32:24] or a token
[32:27] that by which a person or a thing is
[32:29] distinguished from others and known
[32:33] so here's a sign this is a signal this
[32:35] is signification it's distinctive
[32:37] something distinctive a distinctive mark
[32:39] that differentiates a person or thing
[32:41] from others and by which it's made known
[32:44] kind of like when cain said oh no
[32:46] they're going to kill me and god says
[32:47] well i'll put a sign i'll put a mark on
[32:49] you that people will know not to touch
[32:52] you
[32:53] and so that's what a sign is it also is
[32:55] an unusual occurrence that transcends
[32:57] the common course of nature this is what
[33:00] is meant in the word of god i will send
[33:01] signs and lo there'll be signs and
[33:03] there'll be these different signs and so
[33:05] it's something that kind of is a sign
[33:07] gets your attention because like whoa
[33:08] that doesn't normally happen
[33:10] right this is and it's to it signifies
[33:13] something it's an unused sign could be
[33:15] an unusual occurrence so let me say this
[33:17] by definition just any unusual
[33:20] occurrence will be a sign but is it
[33:22] signifying anything
[33:25] in the bible signs can be used as and
[33:28] there's just a lot of we could use in
[33:30] the message of the hour in the bible
[33:32] just showing that a sign can just be as
[33:34] uh jeffersonville five miles just
[33:36] something that's uh showing you that
[33:39] something's coming
[33:41] the flashing red lights of his signs of
[33:43] his coming the signs of the end time
[33:45] this shall be a sign of the end those
[33:46] are things then that happen
[33:49] that are not necessarily pointing back
[33:50] or anything present but telling you
[33:52] something is coming so there's different
[33:54] there's a lot of different ways that
[33:55] sign can be used and i realized that in
[33:58] the outset but was easily got could get
[34:00] lost in just the dynamic of the signs
[34:03] but it comes from the word to signify or
[34:05] to indicate which is it's a signal
[34:09] a sign gives a signal
[34:11] and so if that sign is signaling
[34:15] and that's that's some sort of output
[34:18] to kind of point you back to something
[34:20] if it feeds back into itself
[34:23] that's that's what we're looking at in
[34:24] this slide
[34:27] now
[34:28] are we all together in the same page all
[34:30] right good so in matthew chapter 12
[34:32] verses 38 to 42.
[34:34] we're gonna just we're gonna launch off
[34:36] into a um
[34:38] we took a lot of time on that
[34:40] uh we're gonna launch off into some of
[34:41] the scriptures that treat these signs
[34:43] then certain of the scribes and
[34:44] pharisees answered saying master we
[34:46] would see a sign from thee but he
[34:48] answered and said to them an evil and
[34:49] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[34:53] sign hold that phrase in mind and there
[34:54] shall be no sign given to it
[34:57] but the sign of the prophet jonas so the
[34:59] sign
[35:00] there is going to be a resurrection sign
[35:03] it's under the resurrected messiah
[35:04] there's gonna be something happen first
[35:05] jonas was three days and three nights in
[35:07] the whales belly so shall the son of man
[35:09] be three days and nights in the heart of
[35:11] the earth
[35:12] now that he's saying there shall be i
[35:15] can put there's no other sign given
[35:18] you know this is
[35:19] uh
[35:20] it will touch on it here in just a
[35:21] moment they had received signs
[35:23] so he's not saying up you haven't
[35:25] received any signs he's saying now the
[35:27] only other sign you should look for and
[35:29] the other sign there's going to be is
[35:30] this sign of the resurrection which is
[35:32] christ the son of man is going to
[35:34] resurrect in three days
[35:37] and then he said that so you're seeking
[35:39] a sign there will be no other sign given
[35:40] except the resurrection and then
[35:43] recognize how he amplifies this sign or
[35:46] their attitude towards him show us a
[35:48] sign come on come on show me a sign so
[35:51] we can believe the men of nineveh shall
[35:53] rise in judgment with this generation
[35:55] and shall condemn that generation the
[35:58] sign seeking generation because they the
[36:01] name of a generation repented at the
[36:03] preaching of jonas
[36:05] and behold a greater than jonas is here
[36:07] notice christ language he doesn't say
[36:10] they
[36:11] recognize the sign of the one who smelt
[36:13] like fish or recognize the sign of the
[36:15] one
[36:16] who demonstrated certain no he says they
[36:18] repented at the preaching
[36:21] jonah shows up in nineveh saying repent
[36:23] and they're like
[36:24] okay and general's like ah
[36:28] right
[36:29] but that generation is going to raise up
[36:31] because apart from any signs and wonders
[36:33] and miracles jonah's the one that had
[36:35] them
[36:36] for himself to vindicate the message to
[36:38] go there and preach and have that
[36:39] liberty to preach he didn't need to put
[36:41] up a chart and i want to show you what
[36:43] the inside of a specially prepared fish
[36:44] looks like and could anybody show you
[36:47] this unless they had been there
[36:49] smell me you know right
[36:51] i came out of the it's and really the
[36:53] story of jonah is remarkable when you
[36:55] think about where he would have been
[36:56] swallowed and where he probably would
[36:58] have been burped up on land and really
[37:00] scripture just how long he would have
[37:02] traveled if you just take it literally
[37:04] to get to nineveh
[37:06] and yet when he gets there the word is
[37:08] what he uses and that's what the people
[37:11] repent at and so he's using the people
[37:13] of nineveh who merely repented at the
[37:15] word as being those who would judge the
[37:17] generation receiving the messiah wanting
[37:20] more than the word
[37:24] verse 42 the queen of the south shall
[37:26] rise up in judgment with this generation
[37:28] and shall condemn it for she came from
[37:31] the uttermost parts of the earth to see
[37:33] solomon's wealth to see his gift of
[37:35] discernment to enjoy his signs
[37:38] to hear the wisdom of solomon
[37:42] and behold the greater than jonas is
[37:44] here
[37:44] and behold a greater than solomon is
[37:46] here
[37:47] [Music]
[37:48] he came from the she came to hear the
[37:52] wisdom of solomon the people of nineveh
[37:54] heard the preaching notice what the
[37:56] woman was seeking the queen of sheba
[37:58] what she was seeking the wisdom of
[38:00] solomon which is the word the wisdom
[38:03] that would be imparted that's what she
[38:05] sought what was it that the men of
[38:06] nineveh received the word and that's
[38:08] what brought forth their repentance so
[38:10] christ is actually being very direct in
[38:13] this passage about those that seek signs
[38:16] and what the ultimate is and why those
[38:18] generations will condemn the sign
[38:21] seeking generation because they took god
[38:24] at his word
[38:29] and that queen of the south is the queen
[38:31] of sheba the queen of seven
[38:33] she really represents this bride who
[38:35] raises up out of the seventh church age
[38:37] takes god at his word
[38:40] even considered to be a mythological
[38:42] character historically and geologically
[38:45] they can find no record of her they
[38:46] can't figure out where she came from it
[38:48] seems as if she has no father no mother
[38:50] no beginning of days nor ending of life
[38:53] it's a queen to king melchizedek
[38:58] seeketh when jesus says this generation
[39:00] even adulterous generation seeketh after
[39:02] a sign
[39:03] it implies the very word that is used
[39:05] implies
[39:07] they seek more the seeking is they're
[39:10] seeking more or above and beyond what
[39:12] they had had already
[39:15] so it's not that they're a sign less
[39:16] generation or they haven't seen anything
[39:18] but the language he uses this an evil
[39:20] and adulterous generation seeketh after
[39:23] a sign they want more than what they've
[39:25] already given that's what makes them
[39:27] this evil and adulterous generation is
[39:29] they have received but they still want
[39:31] more
[39:32] and jesus had already demonstrated a
[39:34] scriptural sign that he was the messiah
[39:37] already demonstrated it
[39:39] and that's why nathanael says i believe
[39:42] right
[39:44] he there was something that was
[39:45] demonstrated there's people that
[39:46] believed is this not the very messiah
[39:48] there were those that were believing and
[39:50] what it did on the one it didn't do on
[39:52] the other but now the jews sought more
[39:55] signs from christ because they weren't
[39:58] satisfied with the scriptural sign that
[40:00] was given it's like oh no we want more
[40:03] this is the uber generation this is the
[40:05] more generation this is the plus
[40:06] generation we want a subscription to
[40:09] these kind of signs and we want it
[40:11] delivered every sunday on time and we
[40:14] want to save a little bit if we
[40:15] subscribe
[40:19] that's what they were wanting they saw
[40:21] the signs over christmas
[40:24] now brother brad i'm again i'm going to
[40:25] say i'm reading this statement to be
[40:27] balanced but notice what he
[40:30] what's kind of in this give and take and
[40:32] the fundamental foundation for faith he
[40:35] says we don't have to have signs now
[40:39] remember weak and adulterous generation
[40:40] seeks after signs
[40:42] but friend
[40:44] we've been so educated two are educated
[40:46] away from the supernatural
[40:48] see that slippery slope
[40:50] right where all of a sudden you start
[40:52] you get you you tilt it certain way all
[40:54] of a sudden you just gonna stop
[40:55] believing you tilt it another way and
[40:57] then you can't believe without a sign
[41:00] it says we're educated away from the
[41:01] supernatural that's right jesus said
[41:03] these signs shall follow them that
[41:04] believe
[41:05] we are never seeking signs but god is
[41:08] always there with signs
[41:10] from the very beginning in genesis to
[41:12] revelation in the bible run of the
[41:13] church said it was constantly signs and
[41:15] there was and when there was no signs
[41:17] there was no god
[41:22] so brother when he touches on this
[41:25] particular scripture in several
[41:27] instances he emphasizes how the jews
[41:29] were not wrong to seek a sign they were
[41:31] told to seek assign
[41:33] but they missed the sign that they were
[41:35] told to look for
[41:38] they missed the scriptural sign that was
[41:40] given pointing him back to the word the
[41:42] prophet spoke here came the fulfillment
[41:45] of that prophecy a sign was being
[41:47] manifested and what ought to that sign
[41:49] done
[41:50] putting them right back to the word that
[41:52] was given so they could believe in him
[41:54] whom he hath sent god had sent and that
[41:55] that's what ought to have been happening
[41:57] and that's what happened to the
[41:57] believers
[41:58] so it happened to some of the disciples
[42:00] that say some because we know judas he
[42:02] he walked in all these other things but
[42:04] when it came to the word he couldn't go
[42:05] into that
[42:07] so they missed the sign
[42:09] so there's been a number of statements
[42:11] we've read but now that would be
[42:13] pro-sign if i could say god sends him
[42:15] it's his grace we believe in him we're
[42:17] never seeking after but god is always
[42:19] there with signs where there are no
[42:21] signs there is no god
[42:23] right so well if i want to find god i've
[42:24] got to look for signs i've got to look
[42:26] for signs no no no i got to be careful
[42:29] you've got to be very very careful so
[42:30] this is how we arrive at our conundrum
[42:32] this is where it gets to that paradox
[42:36] the signs follow but there's got to be
[42:38] caution
[42:40] the signs follow but you have to be
[42:41] careful that you're not
[42:43] you're not
[42:44] you're not getting the order reversed in
[42:47] luke chapter 11 when christ
[42:49] this same instance is mentioned in luke
[42:52] chapter 11 verses 27 to 29 notice how
[42:55] again the word
[42:57] becomes the focus and it came to pass as
[42:58] he spake these things a certain woman of
[43:00] the company lifted up her voice and said
[43:01] unto him blessed is the womb that bear
[43:04] thee and the paps which thou has sucked
[43:06] now this is
[43:07] notice the response to want to worship
[43:09] the mother
[43:10] blessed is the woman well here's a
[43:12] here's demonstrative signs being given
[43:14] she's not saying this because jesus was
[43:16] good-looking she's saying this because
[43:18] of the demonstrative signs and the
[43:20] things that he was teaching but notice
[43:21] how through that something
[43:24] is gets a little bit out of out of skew
[43:27] where now she wants to worship mary
[43:29] and the blessing is to go to the mother
[43:32] right and so in that way you have to
[43:34] realize something is very body spirit to
[43:37] that
[43:38] and not soul because their attention's
[43:41] drawn more to oh the woman that gave
[43:42] birth blessed is she but he said yea
[43:45] rather blessed are they that hear the
[43:47] word of god and keep it
[43:48] amen
[43:50] right
[43:52] in other words let's let's get it out of
[43:53] the physical and get it out of the
[43:55] emotional and get right to the heart of
[43:57] the matter the blessing is those that
[43:59] hear the word and keep it
[44:01] and that what in the remark that he made
[44:03] to thomas thomas wanted to feel
[44:05] he was doubting we call them doubting
[44:07] thomas and jesus said blessed are they
[44:09] that believe and have not seen
[44:12] this is the more blessed this is the
[44:14] higher way this is the elevated way this
[44:16] is the ultimate i would that you would
[44:18] take me at my word i would that in
[44:21] reading the word of god or hearing the
[44:22] word of god there's an energy given to
[44:24] you called faith and revelation and when
[44:27] you see it by faith and by revelation
[44:30] yes that's my absolute right
[44:33] so he says yay blessed are they that
[44:35] hear the word of god and keep it
[44:37] and then immediately it says and when
[44:38] they were gathered thick together he
[44:40] began to say
[44:42] this is an evil generation
[44:44] they seek a sign
[44:46] and there shall be no sign given it but
[44:48] the sign of jonas the prophet
[44:50] jesus emphasizes believing the word over
[44:53] believing the sign
[44:55] or he emphasizes believing the word over
[44:56] the
[45:02] sign notice the fanaticism
[45:06] that surrounds it
[45:08] to point to the flesh of mary
[45:13] which would then in turn be responsible
[45:15] in their mind right the responsible for
[45:17] the flesh of christ
[45:20] and that's the cycle they're in
[45:22] oh blessed is this woman because she
[45:24] gave birth to him so she has some causal
[45:26] connection and these are this is what
[45:28] it's related brother branham says in
[45:29] scriptural signs of the time i need to
[45:30] move on jesus here was rebuking that
[45:33] generation because they had not believed
[45:35] his scriptural sign
[45:36] right
[45:37] that's what brother brahm often visits
[45:39] in this he rebuked them because they had
[45:41] not believed a scriptural sign so catch
[45:43] this it was not a rebuke of signs period
[45:47] it was not a rebuke for them believing
[45:49] because of a sign it was not a rebuke
[45:50] for them to be expecting signs it was
[45:53] not because we could say well i believe
[45:55] and so i expect signs to follow and we
[45:57] turn that into something wrong no
[45:59] we believe and that signs will follow so
[46:02] there ought to be some expectation
[46:04] because where god is there's going to be
[46:06] signs but that can't tip into sign
[46:09] seeking
[46:10] so he says i'm not rebuking that
[46:12] generation because they were seeking a
[46:14] sign alone but because they had not
[46:16] believed the sign that had already been
[46:18] given
[46:20] so he says watch these pharisees they
[46:21] come to him and said master we would
[46:22] seek a sign from thee watch the
[46:24] blindness of them what is the blindness
[46:26] related to the sign had already been
[46:28] done and they didn't recognize it
[46:32] so could we could we be guilty of the
[46:34] same in some sort of uh by analogy in
[46:37] our own lives when god gives us the sign
[46:41] and that ought to revert us back to the
[46:43] word in order to have faith but we're
[46:45] still fleecing we're still searching
[46:47] we're still trying to find a feather and
[46:49] build a chicken while we pray for it
[46:53] he says the sign had already been done
[46:54] and they didn't recognize it and this is
[46:56] why i wanted to read this whole
[46:57] statement do you know i believe that one
[46:58] day the rapture will take place and
[47:00] people know nothing about it
[47:02] now i'm thinking real spiritual about
[47:04] this
[47:05] in light of what we ministered last time
[47:07] he's saying that christ was rebuking
[47:10] them
[47:11] for missing the sign that had already
[47:13] been given and they failed to recognize
[47:15] it and brother bannon makes this jump
[47:17] this is right in that same season april
[47:19] of 1964 we read from we referenced a lot
[47:22] of those sermons from tampa that's going
[47:23] to take place later this week he's
[47:25] saying do you know i believe that one
[47:27] day the rapture will take place and
[47:29] people know nothing about it
[47:31] now he didn't change the subject
[47:34] he's given us another
[47:36] another signal to say just as christ was
[47:40] present then
[47:41] and it demonstrated a sign
[47:44] and the next thing that was going to
[47:45] happen was a resurrection
[47:47] god had given if this is if i'm not
[47:49] mistaken this may be very near where
[47:51] he's preaching in birmingham alabama and
[47:53] he says abraham seed receive your last
[47:56] sign
[47:57] the sign had been given if we
[47:59] collectively as a bride are looking for
[48:01] a sign to ignite rapturing faith if
[48:04] we're looking for some signification to
[48:06] happen among certain group of ministers
[48:08] or in special meetings or something
[48:10] demonstrated to happen a gift of
[48:12] discernment or powerful healings if
[48:14] that's what we're looking for in order
[48:16] to be an expectation of the change of
[48:18] our body we are just as guilty of those
[48:21] in matthew chapter 12 and luke chapter
[48:24] 11 by god having already given us a
[48:27] vindicated sign and a voice following
[48:30] and now we're all hungry seeking after
[48:33] signs that's not going to get us to
[48:35] rapturing faith
[48:37] it might get you healed
[48:41] because even brother branham says in a
[48:43] very uh difficult statement to kind of
[48:45] understand sometimes is if intellectual
[48:48] faith will get healed
[48:50] so he's saying it right in connection
[48:52] with the rapture so to me that orients
[48:54] me again it catches me again
[48:58] i had several scriptures here one two
[49:00] three four five scriptures i was going
[49:01] to read very quickly but in mark chapter
[49:04] 8 matthew chapter 16 luke chapter 11
[49:06] earlier than this reference john chapter
[49:08] 2 john chapter 6 the pharisees came
[49:11] seeking of him a sign
[49:13] tempting him
[49:14] matthew 6 tempting him
[49:17] tempting him why were they why was it a
[49:19] temptation because they're trying to
[49:20] draw him astray from god's pattern
[49:23] why was it a temptation to show a sign
[49:25] it wasn't so much that christ would sin
[49:28] but a temptum tempted him to demonstrate
[49:31] something that would place the wrong
[49:32] emphasis
[49:34] the temptation was to now get the order
[49:37] reversed because christ is demonstrating
[49:38] what pattern whatever the father says he
[49:40] does whatever his father speaks he
[49:43] speaks now there's a different there's a
[49:45] different force
[49:47] trying to push him in to do signs
[49:51] for the sake of the people and that
[49:52] would interrupt god's pattern so the
[49:54] pharisees come to seeking a sign then it
[49:56] says the sadducees with the pharisees
[49:59] tempting him desiring that he would show
[50:00] them a sign and then in luke 11 others
[50:03] tempting him sought a sign from heaven
[50:05] in john the jews say what signs show us
[50:08] that one to us so it's the pharisees the
[50:10] sadducees
[50:11] the the the others the jews show us a
[50:15] sign
[50:17] john 6 that great passage that we've
[50:19] been studying a lot from what signs show
[50:22] us thou then that we may see and
[50:24] believe now catch the nature now of the
[50:27] people
[50:28] because this is what jesus is dealing
[50:29] with he's the divine one who's bypassed
[50:31] uh sinful nature so he doesn't have the
[50:34] proclivity
[50:35] to just oh science yeah this sounds
[50:37] great this is wonderful let's do signs
[50:39] he doesn't have that instinct he doesn't
[50:41] have that he can't give in to that
[50:43] temptation he's being tempted but he
[50:44] doesn't have that itch
[50:47] to show off
[50:48] he doesn't have that need to prove
[50:50] himself he doesn't have that need to say
[50:52] well i'm just kind of unsure of my
[50:54] ministry and if i could just get people
[50:55] to raise their hand and if i could just
[50:57] get people at the altar and if i could
[50:59] just he doesn't have to do that
[51:02] he doesn't feel that need he's he's
[51:04] comfortable in his calling he has a
[51:06] revelation of who he is so what we have
[51:08] to recognize christ
[51:10] if i could say being immune to that
[51:13] being tempted but having the character
[51:15] having that gift to resist it it creates
[51:19] the contrast to the people who are now
[51:22] demonstrating let's just be honest
[51:24] we
[51:26] right
[51:27] he's demonstrating humans
[51:29] that's exactly what he's doing is he's
[51:31] showing off they're showing what how we
[51:33] are and it's the nature of people to
[51:35] push it to more to more to more right so
[51:37] some of the attitude people have in
[51:39] taking medicine right if they say take
[51:41] two four is better
[51:43] shouldn't laugh so loud
[51:46] you've been found out or at least your
[51:47] spouse has
[51:48] and that's kind of the attitude people
[51:50] take you know the i i
[51:52] there's there's a joke maybe where if
[51:53] the if the turn the corner says 60 miles
[51:56] an hour on the turn it means you can
[51:57] double it
[51:58] right 30 miles in turn means you can go
[52:00] safely go 60. that's just the way some
[52:02] people think
[52:04] uh whatever it is just double it
[52:06] and that's kind of the nature more more
[52:08] more more that's why we are right now
[52:10] already planning on trading in our
[52:12] iphone 13 pro max
[52:15] for an iphone 14 pro maxer
[52:18] right
[52:19] because we want more
[52:22] and so the nature of the people is
[52:24] more what we've had is really not enough
[52:26] we want more more and so what is it sine
[52:28] sine sine sine sine
[52:30] and christ resists resisted the urge to
[52:32] make the gift and and that's a whole
[52:35] other dynamic is a gift that someone can
[52:37] have but he resisted the urge to make
[52:39] the signs the emphasis
[52:41] he didn't want the signs to become the
[52:43] attraction
[52:45] right if there's a great big marquee
[52:47] then that's the sign but what is the
[52:49] attraction what's inside
[52:52] john was the sign christ was the
[52:54] attraction jesus did not want the signs
[52:56] to become the attraction he was the word
[52:59] he was the attraction and not only do
[53:01] this did he do this when they were thick
[53:02] together but he also did it when he was
[53:05] just alone with satan being tempted in
[53:07] the wilderness who tried to make the
[53:09] fantastic and the visible and the flesh
[53:12] the preeminence and he said no i got to
[53:14] stay with the word
[53:15] i got to stay with the word
[53:18] and brother branham
[53:19] and i've read this before but i want to
[53:21] read this just to kind of emphasize
[53:23] again the nature of the people to push
[53:24] this god keeps his word but there is a
[53:26] supernatural that's been done so in the
[53:28] sermon god keeps his word there's a
[53:30] supernatural that's been done that's
[53:31] true
[53:32] but you're going wild with it
[53:35] you're going on the deep end with it the
[53:37] devil's pushing you off with it you've
[53:39] got plumb out of the bible now
[53:43] this is him whatever the circumstance
[53:45] may be i'm not trying to debate the
[53:46] actual specifics some people may say
[53:48] well brother aaron if you recognize he
[53:50] preached this in such and such church
[53:51] and the pastor there was doing this and
[53:53] doing that and get all historical and
[53:54] get try to add so much context to it
[53:56] that we kind of basically isolated it
[53:58] and just kind of punted it so it's not
[54:00] of any uh use to us but let's just kind
[54:02] of take it in what's in the if we can
[54:05] kind of look at it in its pattern
[54:06] brother brown is saying there's a way
[54:08] that you can take the supernatural
[54:10] that's been done and you can go wild
[54:12] with it
[54:14] so it's an outlier it only happened once
[54:16] well it can happen
[54:18] and go wild with it go off the deep end
[54:20] with it why because the devil's trying
[54:22] to push you to go all in on the signs go
[54:24] all in on the quote-unquote supernatural
[54:27] and you get into the super-duper divine
[54:29] heal and they make a mockery out of a
[54:31] gift they make a mockery out of a
[54:32] dynamic they make a mockery of the
[54:34] brother and so they make an idol out of
[54:35] laying out of hens
[54:38] he says i believe in the supernatural i
[54:40] believe in jesus christ i believe he's
[54:42] the same yesterday today and forever and
[54:43] does the same things that he did
[54:44] yesterday and will forever we believe in
[54:46] the supernatural we believe god placed
[54:48] gifts in the church we believe these
[54:50] signs shall fall them that believe but
[54:52] there must be a balance not for balance
[54:54] sake but for momentum and for progress
[54:58] remember there's several services that
[55:00] kind of built on
[55:01] movement and maturity and progress and
[55:03] having an elevated faith but the human
[55:05] tendency is to become a fanatic
[55:07] now i want to use peter as an example of
[55:09] all of us peter's nature is our all of
[55:11] our natures
[55:13] and in john chapter 13 verses 6 to 10
[55:15] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[55:17] said unto him lord does thou wash my
[55:19] feet and jesus said what i do is not now
[55:21] but thou
[55:22] you don't know what i do now but you
[55:24] will know hereafter and so peter says
[55:26] thou shalt never wash my feet in verse
[55:27] eight
[55:29] this is peter right
[55:30] it's basically are you gonna wash my
[55:32] feet yes and you don't understand what
[55:34] i'm doing but you will later well you're
[55:35] not going to touch my feet
[55:37] and jesus says
[55:39] well if i don't wash you you won't have
[55:40] any part with me lord wash all of me
[55:44] right not my feet only but my hands and
[55:46] my head this is peter
[55:50] i don't need any
[55:51] i want it all
[55:53] i want to be soaking i want to be
[55:54] dripping with pour it on me jesus
[55:57] it was like chill out i'm just trying to
[55:59] wash your feet
[56:01] one minute no washi at all next minute
[56:03] you want me to dunk you
[56:07] and this is what this is his
[56:09] just how dramatic he is and he says
[56:11] simon peter said lord not my feet only
[56:13] jesus says verse 10 he that is washed
[56:15] need to thought save to wash his feet
[56:16] but it's clean everywhere and you're
[56:18] clean but not at all in other words hey
[56:21] just do what i say
[56:24] let me just wash your feet
[56:26] like one minute you're just so reluctant
[56:28] it kind of shows the extremes right
[56:30] there's just there's a peter on one side
[56:32] there's a peter there's like the peter
[56:33] in this ditch and a peter at that ditch
[56:35] and they're both kind of shooting at the
[56:36] guy in the middle
[56:37] drawing their sword against the guy in
[56:39] the middle why because one doesn't want
[56:40] to have any of it the other one wants
[56:41] nothing but that
[56:44] this is peter matthew chapter 17 verses
[56:46] 3 and 5. here he is on mount
[56:48] transfiguration and a tremendous
[56:50] it's just really not even a sign in the
[56:52] sense of something uh indicating
[56:54] something later but an unusual
[56:56] occurrence that something transcends
[56:58] common course of nature takes place and
[57:00] they behold moses and elijah talking
[57:03] with christ
[57:05] that's amazing right i mean that just
[57:07] kind of
[57:08] i know that was a really poor way of
[57:09] describing mount transfiguration that is
[57:12] just
[57:14] right
[57:15] this is this is so supernatural and
[57:18] there's a recognition that peter has
[57:21] right
[57:22] this is where you realize this is
[57:23] something like who are these strange
[57:25] guys talking to jesus they know
[57:28] this is moses
[57:29] they know this is elijah if you really
[57:32] just meditated on it or pondered maybe
[57:35] the uh
[57:36] what's taking place on mount
[57:38] transfiguration this is so extraordinary
[57:43] this is a mount transfiguration
[57:44] experience this is the adoption of
[57:46] christ they are witnesses too brother i
[57:48] said the rehearsal of is coming this is
[57:51] this is so amazing and peter's catching
[57:54] it and peter's seeing it and peter's
[57:56] response is oh oh let's build a church
[58:00] let's build three of them
[58:02] one for moses one for elijah and one for
[58:05] christ and we can go to one on wednesday
[58:08] and one on saturday and one on sunday
[58:10] and we can belong to three churches
[58:12] because you know god's perfecting threes
[58:20] it's like a joke they saw the guy on an
[58:22] island and they rescued him and as
[58:23] they're leaving there was three
[58:24] buildings
[58:25] they said what are those three buildings
[58:26] well that one there's my house
[58:28] so what's that other one so that's my
[58:29] church
[58:30] and i said what's the other one says oh
[58:32] that's the church i used to go to i
[58:33] didn't like it anymore
[58:40] look what he says here
[58:42] verse 3 lord it is good for us to be
[58:43] here
[58:44] if thou wilt let us make three
[58:46] tabernacles one for thee and one for
[58:48] moses and one for elijah
[58:50] and as soon as he says it
[58:52] what does god speak from the cloud this
[58:55] is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[58:56] pleased
[58:57] hear ye him
[58:59] only
[59:01] it doesn't matter how much signs i gave
[59:03] moses it doesn't matter how much signs i
[59:05] gave elijah it doesn't matter how
[59:06] vindicated they were doesn't matter what
[59:08] types they hold and what they prophesied
[59:11] they pointed to christ hear him alone
[59:14] you don't build a religion you don't
[59:15] build a system you don't build a church
[59:17] to the prophets it's the christ
[59:20] but the nature of peter was to elevate
[59:22] the man
[59:24] brother bradham says and as i was with
[59:26] moses so will i be with thee i just want
[59:28] to take a short detour very very very
[59:30] quickly just to refer to how brother
[59:32] branham was talking about the sign that
[59:34] he was given
[59:35] and it was the gifts whether to take
[59:36] someone by the hand or the gift of
[59:38] discernment and that's as i was with
[59:40] moses moses demonstrated those
[59:41] tremendous gifts
[59:43] or had these tremendous signs that were
[59:45] given to him
[59:46] and so brother branham
[59:48] is in this sermon
[59:50] he's talking about the commission
[59:52] and the laying on of hands
[59:54] and just praying for the sick that's the
[59:56] commission and the sign he's talking
[59:57] about
[59:59] aren't necessarily the five signs
[1:00:01] associated with the great commission but
[1:00:03] a gift that he had personally
[1:00:05] which was a sign
[1:00:07] and what take what took place in brother
[1:00:09] branham's ministry where he's saying
[1:00:10] i've been wrong and we've done this
[1:00:12] wrong and we've gone too much after the
[1:00:13] sign and we're looking too much to the
[1:00:15] sign and we're waiting for someone to do
[1:00:16] a sign
[1:00:17] he's really looking at the dynamic of a
[1:00:19] gift where you can pull on the gift and
[1:00:21] you can pull someone into prophesying
[1:00:23] you could pull someone into doing this
[1:00:25] and you can use it that way brother
[1:00:26] ramon even talks about how when you use
[1:00:29] the gift it wears down the person and it
[1:00:31] wears them out and and they're drained
[1:00:34] he says but when god uses it
[1:00:37] right
[1:00:38] so whenever you see whenever a minister
[1:00:40] preaches his heart out and whatever
[1:00:42] whenever there's maybe he's praying for
[1:00:44] the sick and he's completely exhausted
[1:00:45] brother i'm saying well that's because
[1:00:47] people were pulling on that gift
[1:00:49] but when god uses it
[1:00:52] he said it was something different
[1:00:54] so now this pattern that pattern can
[1:00:56] exist today without that kind of dynamic
[1:00:58] gif that kind of prophetic gift
[1:01:00] he says but all pentecostal people like
[1:01:02] signs the pentecostal people like
[1:01:03] science it's kind of what's
[1:01:05] associated with the pentecostal people
[1:01:08] they like to see it the bible said a
[1:01:09] wicked and adulterous generation seeks
[1:01:11] after signs but the commission was
[1:01:13] prayed for the sick
[1:01:14] he just goes back to the commission
[1:01:17] and tens of thousands of times thousands
[1:01:19] i have failed to pray for because they
[1:01:21] all desired the sign
[1:01:24] that amazing
[1:01:25] because everyone wanted to see something
[1:01:27] and they wanted something demonstrated
[1:01:29] whereas he could have prayed for
[1:01:31] thousands
[1:01:32] tens of thousands times thousands so
[1:01:34] really it's kind of like whatever
[1:01:36] thousands you want to go to that he
[1:01:38] could have prayed for and he didn't
[1:01:40] because they all he says they all desire
[1:01:42] it they desired a sign
[1:01:45] what was it they wanted the gift of
[1:01:46] discernment they wanted the gift of him
[1:01:49] telling you what's wrong with you they
[1:01:50] wanted the gift to be demonstrated even
[1:01:52] if they're just a spectator one or
[1:01:54] they're in the audience lord just let
[1:01:56] them call on me lord just let them call
[1:01:58] on me lord just let them call on me and
[1:02:00] brother branham that's a true gift it
[1:02:01] was a true sign right it was this was
[1:02:03] something this is even the sign of the
[1:02:05] messiah but what did the jews want more
[1:02:08] give us more it was like it was never
[1:02:10] enough
[1:02:12] it was how many times did he need to do
[1:02:13] it
[1:02:15] how often did he have to demonstrate it
[1:02:17] and so it it flipped into that wrong
[1:02:19] feedback loop
[1:02:21] where now it was just all about the sign
[1:02:23] and let me be very careful on how i
[1:02:24] articulate this
[1:02:26] be very aware be very careful how that
[1:02:30] many times what gets the headline is
[1:02:32] that kind of gift what gets the headline
[1:02:35] is when god and i'm being very clear
[1:02:36] about this when god
[1:02:38] uses that type of gift and not to that
[1:02:41] level of brother branham but in another
[1:02:42] way oh lord if if you want me to do this
[1:02:45] or lord if i'm going to receive my
[1:02:47] healing have brother aaron just just
[1:02:49] talk today about tendinitis or let him
[1:02:51] talk about corporal tunnel syndrome lord
[1:02:53] please i want to be healed in my
[1:02:54] corporal tunnel syndrome just let
[1:02:56] brother aaron bring it up and if he
[1:02:57] could just bring it up may he mention
[1:02:58] the left hand and may he specifically
[1:03:00] talk about tennis elbow and if he can do
[1:03:02] that lord just please if he can do that
[1:03:04] and i know i'm gonna be healed god's
[1:03:05] love for you will actually cause me just
[1:03:07] all of a sudden use a hypothetical about
[1:03:08] corporal tunnel syndrome and tennis
[1:03:10] elbow
[1:03:11] on the left hand just so you can believe
[1:03:14] and you know what that gets the
[1:03:16] headlines right we tell the testimony
[1:03:17] next wednesday i was praying that god
[1:03:19] would do this and brother aaron got up
[1:03:21] there and he just said this that and the
[1:03:22] other exactly what i needed i prayed for
[1:03:24] this sign i prayed to this fleece and
[1:03:25] this is exactly what happened and
[1:03:27] everyone's listening okay what did you
[1:03:28] do you prayed for that sign god gave you
[1:03:31] the sign and you got healed okay let me
[1:03:32] try that and there's a person sitting
[1:03:34] over there going huh i just took god at
[1:03:36] his word at the beginning of service
[1:03:38] when he said whatever you have need of
[1:03:39] just lift your hand and you raise that
[1:03:40] left hand and say lord i believe for the
[1:03:42] healing of my arm and all this thing
[1:03:45] and guess what that's that testimony
[1:03:47] don't get told it's the other one that
[1:03:48] does
[1:03:49] why because those
[1:03:52] though i mean they don't they didn't
[1:03:53] create readers digest and guidepost
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:57] for that kind of faith
[1:03:59] it's the whoa that is crazy that is
[1:04:01] amazing that is a miracle
[1:04:03] that's usually what gets the headlines
[1:04:04] right so and so did this and so and so
[1:04:06] did that the gift
[1:04:08] and i took a whole portion of my notes
[1:04:10] just kind of cut them completely out
[1:04:12] where brother i'm going down that line
[1:04:14] of tommy osborne and oral roberts and
[1:04:16] all these gifts that get the preeminence
[1:04:18] and have the prims and what it becomes
[1:04:19] and the fanaticism and how luther was
[1:04:22] the remarkable thing about his ministry
[1:04:24] is he lifted his head above the
[1:04:25] fanaticism
[1:04:26] was it's lifting your head above the
[1:04:28] noise
[1:04:30] in the wrong feedback loop the echo
[1:04:32] chamber lifting your head above that
[1:04:35] matthew chapter 7 verses 21-23
[1:04:40] wherefore by their fruit you shall know
[1:04:42] them this is another
[1:04:44] remarkable instance about signs
[1:04:46] and fruits
[1:04:48] signification the fruit signifies the
[1:04:50] life of the tree wherefore by the fruits
[1:04:51] you shall know them brother said that
[1:04:53] even with respect to the fruits of the
[1:04:54] spirit and galatians brother bram said
[1:04:56] the devil can impersonate every single
[1:04:57] one of them
[1:04:59] wherefore by their fruit you shall know
[1:05:00] them okay so i'm a fruit inspector i'm
[1:05:03] looking for fruits but then watch this
[1:05:05] it's almost like a complete
[1:05:07] all right all right and then all of a
[1:05:09] sudden but
[1:05:11] he says not everyone that saith unto me
[1:05:12] lord lord shall enter in the kingdom of
[1:05:14] heaven so you're like well it's just not
[1:05:15] the fruit of lord lord
[1:05:16] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:05:18] which is in heaven now what was the
[1:05:20] great commission what are the five signs
[1:05:23] they shall cast out devils in my name
[1:05:25] they shall lay hands on the sick take up
[1:05:27] deadly surface drink any deadly thing
[1:05:29] and and and speak with new tongues these
[1:05:31] are the five signs so these are we would
[1:05:32] say these are the signs that follow them
[1:05:34] that believe we're kind of looking for
[1:05:35] these things
[1:05:36] and he says he that doeth the will of my
[1:05:38] father which is in heaven many shall say
[1:05:40] to me in that day lord lord have we not
[1:05:43] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:05:46] cast out devils in a night name done
[1:05:49] many wonderful works could it not be
[1:05:51] that he's already foreshadowing what the
[1:05:54] signs of the great commission would be
[1:05:57] lord lord this is not yo yo this isn't
[1:06:00] papa this is lord lord this is a sign of
[1:06:03] reverence this is a seems to be a sign
[1:06:05] of understanding we've prophesied in
[1:06:06] your name we cast out devils in your
[1:06:08] name we did many wonderful works in your
[1:06:10] name we are bearing the name of
[1:06:12] christian we are used in the name of
[1:06:14] jesus christ and then i will profess
[1:06:17] unto them i never knew you depart from
[1:06:21] me ye that work iniquity
[1:06:23] these are workers of iniquity for the
[1:06:25] man places and therefore in the cast of
[1:06:27] reprobates heathen like the wicked
[1:06:31] but yet here they are professing
[1:06:33] christianity brother braham said jesus
[1:06:35] does not deny that they did mighty works
[1:06:37] that only the holy ghost can accomplish
[1:06:39] by way of men
[1:06:41] didn't deny that
[1:06:42] but he did deny ever knowing them
[1:06:45] and he said they weren't backsliders
[1:06:49] is this doesn't that kind of create this
[1:06:51] real scary
[1:06:53] form of godliness
[1:06:56] has all the look and all the feel and
[1:06:58] all the representation but inside is
[1:07:00] missing word faith word faith word faith
[1:07:03] but on the outside there's a lot of
[1:07:04] activity
[1:07:05] but having the form of god's but denying
[1:07:07] the power of revelation
[1:07:09] which can only come by the word
[1:07:11] which can which boosts his faith
[1:07:13] but in another place says you can't
[1:07:14] claim the manifestation is the evidence
[1:07:16] of being spirit born or spirit-filled
[1:07:18] what are these what are these works
[1:07:20] manifestations fruits of the spirit
[1:07:22] gifts signs are manifestations of the
[1:07:24] spirit but he says you can't claim it as
[1:07:26] an evidence of being spirit-filled no
[1:07:28] sir i will admit that true manifestation
[1:07:31] is the evidence of the holy spirit doing
[1:07:33] mighty acts
[1:07:35] you realize then how we have to divide
[1:07:36] this and how we have to separate it we
[1:07:38] have to recognize that where there is a
[1:07:40] manifestation of the spirit according to
[1:07:42] the word we don't speak against that
[1:07:45] we said that's the holy spirit doing
[1:07:47] mighty acts to the extent that one is
[1:07:49] wanting to use it to point to something
[1:07:52] other than the word then we say ah
[1:07:54] you've gone too far right
[1:07:57] that's where we don't we don't have to
[1:07:58] throw the baby out with the bathwater so
[1:08:00] to speak we say oh no i believe god i
[1:08:02] believe god healed them i believe you
[1:08:03] raised them from the dead but that
[1:08:04] doesn't mean you're my prophet that
[1:08:06] doesn't mean you're my god
[1:08:08] that can only come by faith by the word
[1:08:10] so so it's not a it's a true
[1:08:11] manifestation
[1:08:12] he admits a manifestation is the
[1:08:14] evidence of the holy spirit but it is
[1:08:15] not the evidence of the individual being
[1:08:17] spirit filled even though that
[1:08:19] individual
[1:08:20] has an abundance of those
[1:08:22] manifestations
[1:08:24] by your fruit by their fruits you shall
[1:08:26] know them
[1:08:27] it takes it more than just kind of the
[1:08:29] outside when i was reading this last i
[1:08:32] guess
[1:08:32] looking at it and recognizing that there
[1:08:35] is a uh
[1:08:37] jesus is kind of calling out the first
[1:08:38] virtue signalers right
[1:08:41] they were virtue signaling in that they
[1:08:42] were talking about all their works to
[1:08:44] make it look look how good they are how
[1:08:45] virtuous they are trying to demonstrate
[1:08:47] their correctness and their
[1:08:49] righteousness by what they did but what
[1:08:51] was it it's the wrong signal
[1:08:55] because their signal loop their signs
[1:08:56] loop right back into themselves
[1:08:58] and used as the defense
[1:09:01] i cast out devils in your name we did
[1:09:03] this and it vindicated themselves not
[1:09:06] christ
[1:09:07] there's no reliance on his grace
[1:09:09] there's no but lord you said if i
[1:09:10] believed you would receive me
[1:09:13] it steps in this whole another realm we
[1:09:15] were signed to sign to sign to sign to
[1:09:16] sign a sign design
[1:09:18] how could you discount this and he said
[1:09:20] i i don't i don't know you you're you're
[1:09:21] in your own other round pen here you're
[1:09:23] doing you're not in the dynamo
[1:09:27] so they do many wonderful works and as
[1:09:29] we read in matthew chapter 24 verse 24
[1:09:31] there shall rise false christ false
[1:09:32] prophets shall show great signs and
[1:09:34] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:09:35] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:09:37] elect
[1:09:39] what was a sign an unusual occurrence
[1:09:41] something distinguishing a wonder is
[1:09:43] something exceptional something
[1:09:45] impressive they shall show great signs
[1:09:48] and wonders and he calls them false
[1:09:50] christ what is a false christ a genuine
[1:09:52] holy spirit anointing but upon a false
[1:09:55] person
[1:09:57] so the anointing is true but the person
[1:09:59] is false the teaching is false what
[1:10:00] follows is false
[1:10:02] but i said christ means the anointed
[1:10:04] ones falsely anointed they are anointed
[1:10:06] but they are false at the bottom of it
[1:10:09] and do great signs and wonders speak in
[1:10:11] tongues dance in the spirit preach the
[1:10:13] gospel
[1:10:14] now what we're i think what we're
[1:10:16] arriving to very late and i apologize in
[1:10:18] that regards
[1:10:20] and i recognize it's starting to get a
[1:10:21] little hot in here
[1:10:23] that
[1:10:24] this is where now once we've taken the
[1:10:26] signs
[1:10:27] and we seem to have placed them in a
[1:10:29] place we realized we have to accept
[1:10:30] these we receive these they follow the
[1:10:32] believer they follow the believer but
[1:10:34] now in a way we're we're shifting that
[1:10:36] from that first slide we're now looking
[1:10:38] how the second slide can develop where
[1:10:41] the sign now there's a whole other group
[1:10:43] of people that can seem to have the
[1:10:44] signs
[1:10:46] well these signs shall follow them that
[1:10:47] believe so that we should just have this
[1:10:49] comfort level are they snake handling
[1:10:50] are they speaking in new tongues are
[1:10:52] they baptizing in jesus name like okay
[1:10:53] then they're they're the believers but
[1:10:55] then all of a sudden it's like well you
[1:10:56] know what just anybody who wants to can
[1:10:59] or this is possible without having faith
[1:11:03] they do great signs and wonders speak in
[1:11:05] tongues dance in the spirit preach the
[1:11:06] gospel
[1:11:07] in second timothy chapter 3
[1:11:09] verse 8 paul tells timothy that his
[1:11:12] genesis and jamborees withstood moses
[1:11:14] these are the names commonly given to
[1:11:16] the egyptian magicians who resisted
[1:11:17] moses
[1:11:18] and if we had time we could go in the
[1:11:20] scripture how did they resist moses
[1:11:24] by impersonating moses
[1:11:27] they didn't resist them by saying well
[1:11:28] that's impossible that you're you're you
[1:11:30] know that's you know that's not how i
[1:11:32] mean you just close your eyes ignore it
[1:11:34] there's nothing to it no they're just
[1:11:35] like what a cheap trick we can do it too
[1:11:38] and they impersonated the sign they
[1:11:41] impersonated the gift they could kind of
[1:11:42] do the same thing these magicians
[1:11:45] impersonating a vindicated prophet sign
[1:11:48] and so they resisted the truth by
[1:11:50] impersonating the sign of the truth
[1:11:55] so keep that in mind the resistance to
[1:11:57] truth isn't so much an outright
[1:11:59] rejection of it but a reassembling of
[1:12:02] the signs as a way of protecting you and
[1:12:05] keeping you from truth
[1:12:07] a sign originally is given to loop you
[1:12:09] back to the word so someone fabricates a
[1:12:12] a sign and impersonates a sign so that
[1:12:15] what you go to sign to sign to sign
[1:12:18] because it's not pointing back to the
[1:12:19] word
[1:12:20] i have to go very very quickly here and
[1:12:22] he says they reprobate concerning the
[1:12:24] faith why because it's signs being
[1:12:27] impersonated not the word producing
[1:12:29] faith producing a sign pointing back to
[1:12:31] the word to repeat the cycle again or as
[1:12:33] an off spin-off of that dynamo it's
[1:12:36] become an impersonation with the intent
[1:12:38] to deceive bill abraham said satan can
[1:12:41] impersonate any gift
[1:12:44] he says the devil can impersonate any of
[1:12:46] those things talking about speaking in
[1:12:47] tongues casting out devils doing those
[1:12:49] things and preaching when he talks about
[1:12:51] this as far as an impersonation he means
[1:12:53] he these things can happen but it'd be a
[1:12:56] false anointing
[1:12:59] he even says look the divine the beatles
[1:13:01] are now going to impersonate divine
[1:13:04] healing
[1:13:04] filthy dirty rotten born out of hell
[1:13:08] so
[1:13:08] paul telling timothy in the last days
[1:13:10] second timothy 3 talks about in the last
[1:13:12] days
[1:13:13] satan is going to exhibit the same lying
[1:13:16] wonders
[1:13:18] signs miracles and wonders think very
[1:13:20] very personal now i think very very
[1:13:22] close to home because remember the the
[1:13:25] the deception
[1:13:26] and even the betrayal
[1:13:29] is from within very very close brothers
[1:13:32] in the same church that false
[1:13:34] manifestation is not we're not all
[1:13:36] worried about all of a sudden the pope
[1:13:37] having a prayer line at the vatican
[1:13:39] right
[1:13:40] we say we'd be like about time right
[1:13:43] but that's what he does all the time
[1:13:44] right kiss the ring get me give you the
[1:13:45] blessing now
[1:13:48] that the whole
[1:13:49] the whole how close it gets and can be
[1:13:51] deceiving is it comes really close to
[1:13:53] home because all the signs and wonders
[1:13:55] are create the wrong kind of feedback
[1:13:57] loop in order to distract you and lead
[1:13:59] you astray
[1:14:00] it's exactly what revelations 13 14 says
[1:14:03] that the he deceiveth them that dwell
[1:14:04] from the earth by the means of those
[1:14:06] miracles
[1:14:08] signs wonders miracles manifestations
[1:14:10] misused and then misunderstood to draw
[1:14:13] people away from the truth
[1:14:15] that's the wrong emphasis
[1:14:19] i've run out of time but in second
[1:14:20] thessalonians i say run out of time but
[1:14:22] you all are so familiar with that phrase
[1:14:24] like that just doesn't mean anything
[1:14:26] it just means we're clearly in the after
[1:14:28] hour
[1:14:29] but i i can't i'm not going to read all
[1:14:31] the scripture but in second
[1:14:32] thessalonians chapter 2 what does it
[1:14:34] speak of
[1:14:35] the antichrist working with signs and
[1:14:38] lying wonders
[1:14:40] that deceives people
[1:14:42] and why are they deceived
[1:14:44] because they have a taste for signs and
[1:14:46] not a love for the truth
[1:14:50] if they didn't have if that wasn't what
[1:14:51] they were seeking if that was is it what
[1:14:53] they were conditioned for if that wasn't
[1:14:55] what they were looking for then maybe
[1:14:57] the signs don't have the impact it's not
[1:14:59] in their dna it's not in their history
[1:15:01] it's not in their love it's not in their
[1:15:02] want
[1:15:04] they've already been quick into the fact
[1:15:05] that god operates by his word but the
[1:15:07] rest of them are left to where their
[1:15:09] more itchy ears and the sensational and
[1:15:11] signs and wonders and he demonstrates
[1:15:14] them and they lie to them and it says
[1:15:16] that they receive not a love of the
[1:15:18] truth that they might be saved that's
[1:15:20] that last verse part of verse 10 there
[1:15:22] they did not have a love of the truth
[1:15:24] that they might be saved signs won't
[1:15:26] save you signs won't even heal you it
[1:15:28] has to be a love of the truth that you
[1:15:30] might be saved because the word preached
[1:15:33] is what instigates faith to be saved and
[1:15:35] these people entered into entirely
[1:15:37] different dynamic and boy was it dynamic
[1:15:41] but it deceived them and god gives them
[1:15:42] over to a strong delusion
[1:15:44] because their system promoted the sign
[1:15:46] and since it promoted the sign it
[1:15:48] becomes their delusion
[1:15:51] brother abraham says and works his faith
[1:15:52] expressed but we want to find a way now
[1:15:55] i bring this back to divine healings we
[1:15:56] try to wrap this up what takes place the
[1:15:58] real basic of divine healing
[1:16:01] now gift just like i said last night a
[1:16:02] gift is wonderful
[1:16:04] but you can't base your eternal
[1:16:05] destination on gifts
[1:16:07] you cannot major on a minor and a gift
[1:16:09] is a minor and satan can impersonate any
[1:16:12] gift god's got he can make something
[1:16:14] just exactly like it see exactly
[1:16:16] therefore we got to watch out
[1:16:19] and i believe that maybe at least
[1:16:22] on the most basic level we can say that
[1:16:24] satan can appear
[1:16:27] right because we know satan cannot
[1:16:29] actually heal
[1:16:30] so in this way there is a
[1:16:33] an appearance of things that aren't real
[1:16:36] it says therefore we got to watch that
[1:16:38] like sometimes i express about shouting
[1:16:40] i've seen demons shout
[1:16:41] speak in tongues i've seen demons speak
[1:16:43] in tongues sure he impersonates it it
[1:16:45] isn't genuine but it impersonates it
[1:16:47] makes it look like it's real
[1:16:49] and people sometimes who don't know the
[1:16:51] difference declare to be real when it
[1:16:53] isn't real
[1:16:54] and the same thing they do about divine
[1:16:56] healing so you recognize how he
[1:16:59] just amplifies
[1:17:01] says better what i was trying to say
[1:17:03] he does the same thing about divine
[1:17:04] healing and this is where if we've
[1:17:07] looked at all these examples of divine
[1:17:09] healing to try to derive some sort of
[1:17:11] faith for the moment when we're sick
[1:17:13] and we're looking at oh well this one
[1:17:15] sister what she did is she asked that
[1:17:17] the brother would just preach on this
[1:17:19] rare disease or she just asked that they
[1:17:21] would actually call a prayer line and
[1:17:23] all whatever god did to meet that
[1:17:25] daughter and her need praise god
[1:17:27] hallelujah whatever whatever way that
[1:17:30] gideon wants to fleece the lord and god
[1:17:32] confirm whatever he's already said
[1:17:33] that's between them too but we have to
[1:17:35] be careful that it doesn't establish a
[1:17:37] pattern for our faith or the faith of
[1:17:39] god's elect or the way that the church
[1:17:41] operates or even just how that you will
[1:17:43] operate and he's saying the same thing
[1:17:45] with divine healing
[1:17:48] and this to me it kind of puts in this
[1:17:49] place i'm not trying to make you
[1:17:50] reluctant i'm not trying to make you
[1:17:52] suspicious but what it ought to do is
[1:17:54] put the real highlighter underlying bold
[1:17:57] and lights around the word
[1:18:00] as the ultimate and realize that the
[1:18:02] word will manifest what brings gifts the
[1:18:05] word brings signs it's the word that
[1:18:07] does all these things because we say
[1:18:09] well these gifts signs wonders all these
[1:18:10] different things can be impersonated
[1:18:12] well then how do we measure signs
[1:18:14] what should our attitude be towards them
[1:18:16] how do we place them
[1:18:18] and in second thessalonians they
[1:18:19] received not a love of the truth
[1:18:21] what was it
[1:18:22] the word
[1:18:24] the word is what they rejected brother
[1:18:26] branham in question and answers part one
[1:18:27] there will be false anointed ones and
[1:18:28] they'll call themselves prophets but how
[1:18:30] will you recognize them by the word
[1:18:32] that's how you'll know it by the word
[1:18:34] whether they are right how we recognize
[1:18:35] them will be by the word
[1:18:38] if they say they have the word and then
[1:18:39] deny the word then there's nothing to it
[1:18:41] no matter what they do they might heal
[1:18:43] the sick they might open the eyes of the
[1:18:45] blind
[1:18:46] and deny the word stay away from it
[1:18:49] because again it's that god will honor
[1:18:52] faith god works in gifts of healings
[1:18:55] god there's a way that the word of god
[1:18:56] can be used right
[1:18:59] and successful in certain ways and he's
[1:19:01] saying they could open the eyes of the
[1:19:03] blind they can heal the sick they can
[1:19:04] kind of tap into that and people can be
[1:19:07] actually receiving it but if they deny
[1:19:10] the word then you've got to be able to
[1:19:12] recognize that that dynamic what's
[1:19:14] taking place because he says stay away
[1:19:17] from that i don't care what it is stay
[1:19:19] with that word regardless because many
[1:19:21] times i've seen voodoo and all kinds of
[1:19:22] things take place under healing
[1:19:25] okay even in that sense that the body
[1:19:28] even the way that someone could be
[1:19:30] worked up into some sort of frenzy to
[1:19:31] have certain manifestations
[1:19:33] it it's kind of this caution wow i can't
[1:19:36] give myself over to this
[1:19:39] i i can't get that taste
[1:19:41] i can't get that bent
[1:19:43] or before you know it i'll become like
[1:19:45] peter yeah i never had any miracles at
[1:19:47] all didn't even believe in him but now i
[1:19:48] can't believe unless there are some
[1:19:51] it's the word
[1:19:52] that's why we ended in our text in verse
[1:19:54] 28 of matthew chapter 24. for
[1:19:56] wheresoever the carcass is there the
[1:19:58] eagles will be gathered together
[1:20:00] sign signs everywhere signs everyone
[1:20:02] point he's here he's there but where
[1:20:04] where is he
[1:20:05] he's where the word is
[1:20:08] where the carcass is and luke it calls
[1:20:09] it the body where the body is the eagles
[1:20:12] are gathered together
[1:20:14] and you know what a gathering of eagles
[1:20:15] is called
[1:20:20] a convocation
[1:20:24] a holy convocation
[1:20:26] that's what one or more eagles is the
[1:20:28] convocation this is the convocation
[1:20:29] today
[1:20:30] we're gathering together around the body
[1:20:32] word
[1:20:33] gathered around the word and what is
[1:20:35] brother branham when he deals with this
[1:20:36] in his ministry what is he saying not
[1:20:38] the pentecostal buzzards not the
[1:20:40] pentecostal message not luther not
[1:20:42] wesley where are we gathered together to
[1:20:44] the word not deceived by signs not
[1:20:47] deceived by oh go to this body in the
[1:20:49] desert go over here go over there no
[1:20:50] it's to the word
[1:20:52] brother bradman easter seal he says a
[1:20:54] lot of people that really think they got
[1:20:55] it when they haven't a lot of people do
[1:20:57] it because they've got false impression
[1:20:59] of what they've seen other christians do
[1:21:02] i think that's that is a perfect
[1:21:04] statement in itself just to to have
[1:21:06] weight to that sake can impersonate any
[1:21:07] of that we know that and as missionaries
[1:21:09] you can see it impersonated shouting
[1:21:11] dancing speaking in tongues and all
[1:21:12] things you can see it impersonated
[1:21:14] anywhere absolutely now i will say that
[1:21:17] a lot of these instances brother brown
[1:21:19] is pointing to some sort of heathen
[1:21:20] practices and sort of maybe a shaman or
[1:21:22] some witchcraft or some sort of idol
[1:21:24] worship manifesting the same signs but
[1:21:26] we don't just say well as long as
[1:21:28] they're naming christ it's legit as long
[1:21:29] as they're naming the message it's legit
[1:21:31] right some of the most uh charismatic
[1:21:34] demonstrative some of the best worship
[1:21:37] best worship music i got to be very
[1:21:38] careful where i'm going with this but in
[1:21:40] in the history of the message some of
[1:21:42] the most dynamic uh moving
[1:21:46] energizing uh movements are built around
[1:21:49] a man or a false kingdom or false
[1:21:51] doctrine
[1:21:52] and not the message the pure message
[1:21:57] so he says it can be a person amongst
[1:21:59] heathen people who deny there is such a
[1:22:00] thing as jesus christ being the son of
[1:22:02] god and they do all these things
[1:22:03] themselves but the real true quickening
[1:22:06] spirit that comes to a believer quickens
[1:22:08] him to god's word that's back to eagle
[1:22:10] food again right back where he lives
[1:22:13] there's there there it is the word
[1:22:15] quickens faith no matter what signs
[1:22:17] follow he comes right back to eagle's
[1:22:19] food again
[1:22:20] he knows where he got his faith
[1:22:22] he knows what energized him he knows
[1:22:24] what stimulates him it's the stimulation
[1:22:26] of revelation that gets the believers
[1:22:27] cited not the signs we believe in them
[1:22:29] they're wonderful they're great when god
[1:22:30] gives them it's his grace
[1:22:32] and we don't deny him at all but i know
[1:22:33] what produced that
[1:22:35] and so i come back to the word and
[1:22:37] that's what energizes me come right back
[1:22:39] it quickens me back to the word again
[1:22:41] so sign signs everywhere signs but what
[1:22:44] are you feeding on
[1:22:46] there are signs everywhere in this day
[1:22:47] that we're living in
[1:22:49] everywhere
[1:22:50] whether it be long-haired freaky people
[1:22:52] or whether it be people with no hair at
[1:22:54] all whatever it is out there there are
[1:22:55] signs signs everywhere signs and
[1:22:58] everyone trying to get your attention
[1:22:59] everyone trying to point you to
[1:23:00] something everyone trying to say this is
[1:23:02] it this is it this is it
[1:23:04] what are we looking to
[1:23:07] because signs are given in the original
[1:23:09] form the signs are given to cause
[1:23:10] someone to look to the promised word
[1:23:13] because it orients back to the promise
[1:23:16] it fits it's congruent he sent his word
[1:23:19] and it produced faith and it healed them
[1:23:21] so he sent his word he sent his word and
[1:23:23] we believed and lay hands on the sick
[1:23:25] and they recovered did this it's kind of
[1:23:27] it's gonna that system isn't necessarily
[1:23:30] some sort of closed loop but the way
[1:23:32] that it works is this input is gonna is
[1:23:34] gonna give us feedback that the word is
[1:23:36] real the word is true
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:41] and then
[1:23:42] in the other sense that we're pointing
[1:23:44] out and i i want to i want to close
[1:23:47] so badly but we don't always get what we
[1:23:49] want
[1:23:52] just glad you're getting what you need
[1:23:54] today
[1:23:57] signs can be impersonated
[1:24:00] and impersonating them it blind people
[1:24:02] from truth through the noise
[1:24:06] the feedback loop
[1:24:07] well what did brother branham even say
[1:24:09] anyways
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:13] right
[1:24:14] have you ever been in a meeting where
[1:24:16] everybody's shouting and saying amen and
[1:24:17] you're pretty sure they don't hear him
[1:24:18] anymore
[1:24:20] i've sat in meetings where i'm like
[1:24:23] i'm just gonna have to take y'all's word
[1:24:25] for it
[1:24:27] because i have no idea what he just said
[1:24:30] right
[1:24:33] and in that loop and i'm just going to
[1:24:36] try to be very very succinct brother
[1:24:37] branham talks about how deceiving these
[1:24:39] things are and he makes this statement
[1:24:41] right up to the very point
[1:24:43] and then drop back
[1:24:45] they go right up to the word
[1:24:46] and then drop back
[1:24:49] so what is it that happens
[1:24:51] word
[1:24:52] faith
[1:24:53] then in some level there are signs that
[1:24:54] start to be manifested
[1:24:56] and in the sign
[1:24:57] they seem to come right back to the word
[1:24:59] but drop back to the sign they're coming
[1:25:01] right back but they always go back to
[1:25:03] right up to it always drop back right up
[1:25:06] to it always drop back
[1:25:08] and brother brahma says and writes this
[1:25:10] in the church age book chapter 10. have
[1:25:11] you ever noticed that in the harvest
[1:25:13] time
[1:25:13] though there is real acceleration in the
[1:25:15] ripening there's consequently a slowing
[1:25:17] of growth until there is no growth
[1:25:20] is that not exactly what we're seeing
[1:25:21] now the false vine is losing multitudes
[1:25:23] to the communist and various other types
[1:25:25] of belief
[1:25:27] my son elliot shared with me some
[1:25:29] outstanding statements by brother adam
[1:25:30] smith
[1:25:32] the economist the writer from scotland
[1:25:33] on on communism
[1:25:35] in the 18th century and these different
[1:25:37] some of the things that he even begin to
[1:25:39] recognize with the pitfalls of communism
[1:25:42] the false fine is losing multitudes to
[1:25:43] communism and various other people types
[1:25:45] of belief her numbers are not increasing
[1:25:47] as she would like us to think
[1:25:49] her hold on to people is not what it
[1:25:51] used to be think of all these
[1:25:52] charismatic revivals calling people back
[1:25:54] to god
[1:25:56] and these um
[1:25:57] a lot of a lot of times now they're
[1:25:59] built around music
[1:26:01] right and brother steve is going around
[1:26:02] the world with his guitar i don't know
[1:26:03] how to say his last name so i'm gonna
[1:26:05] try right and just these great rallies
[1:26:07] and everyone's it seems like this great
[1:26:09] move and this call to god he goes and in
[1:26:12] many cases going to church is just a
[1:26:14] show
[1:26:16] talk about the seeds of prophecy
[1:26:19] you can't find a church anymore that
[1:26:21] doesn't have stage lighting
[1:26:24] you go and you're like wait a minute
[1:26:25] hold on let me adjust
[1:26:27] right
[1:26:28] and everything's choreographed you don't
[1:26:30] think it's choreographed i can actually
[1:26:32] find the the
[1:26:33] the audio tracks to the background of
[1:26:35] the production where they're like all
[1:26:38] right
[1:26:39] five four three two cue the smoke
[1:26:43] one you're on and then it's like done
[1:26:46] done all right bring in the drums and
[1:26:48] everyone's got a headset
[1:26:49] and they're all being told what to do
[1:26:51] right all right we're coming to the
[1:26:52] bridge now really work it bring it down
[1:26:54] bring it down now work the bridge slowly
[1:26:56] slowly all right five four gonna take up
[1:26:58] a key three two one and the person's in
[1:27:00] the back choreographing all of it
[1:27:02] it's like all right we're going to bring
[1:27:03] on pastor phil in 10 seconds and pastor
[1:27:06] phil gets queued up right he comes out
[1:27:07] with his really expensive sneakers on
[1:27:11] and
[1:27:12] anymore tell you right now anymore a lot
[1:27:14] of the most
[1:27:15] popular ministries are stand-up
[1:27:16] comedians
[1:27:19] they just get up there and they tell
[1:27:21] they tell stories and riff and they get
[1:27:23] the people laughing i'm not saying i
[1:27:25] don't make you laugh but they do all
[1:27:27] they do is tell a bunch of stories no
[1:27:29] substance whatsoever and people like
[1:27:31] this is just so raw and it's just so
[1:27:33] real and it's just so emotional
[1:27:37] it's just a show brother brown said
[1:27:40] and he says in a true vine what about
[1:27:41] her is she growing
[1:27:46] where are those vast numbers that keep
[1:27:48] coming to revivals and answer altar
[1:27:49] calls
[1:27:51] and then this is the kind of the this is
[1:27:53] the
[1:27:53] the meat here on this are not most of
[1:27:55] them merely emotional in their approach
[1:27:58] a desirous of something physical rather
[1:28:00] than desiring that which is truly
[1:28:01] spiritual
[1:28:04] there's therein lies the problem
[1:28:07] is when your taste becomes for the
[1:28:09] physical
[1:28:11] in the emotional
[1:28:13] instead of that which is truly spiritual
[1:28:15] and if our faith isn't placed right
[1:28:17] it'll stagnate while seeking signs
[1:28:19] and we'll be desperate for something
[1:28:21] from god and because our faith isn't
[1:28:23] placed right
[1:28:24] it's not given us that constant
[1:28:26] satisfaction even in the absence of what
[1:28:28] we pray for when your faith is placed
[1:28:30] right it doesn't devastate you
[1:28:32] you can believe and you can believe for
[1:28:34] your healing and you can have your if
[1:28:36] your faith is placed right then in the
[1:28:38] absence of your heal and you're like
[1:28:39] this isn't gonna this isn't i'm not
[1:28:41] worried about this
[1:28:43] god's got it all in control whatever god
[1:28:44] god's i put it in his hands i'm going
[1:28:46] forward i'm not gonna live under some
[1:28:48] sort of sentence and your faith is
[1:28:50] placed right absent any kind of
[1:28:51] manifestation any kind of confirmation
[1:28:53] but if your faith isn't placed right and
[1:28:55] you start asking god for something and
[1:28:57] your faith has been placed in something
[1:28:58] else you're gonna find you're trying to
[1:28:59] find a place to put your faith just give
[1:29:01] me a sign please i said lord i want
[1:29:04] someplace to put my foot on i want to be
[1:29:05] able to put this somewhere oh the doctor
[1:29:08] didn't give me a very good report i'm
[1:29:09] starting to feel this i'm starting to
[1:29:10] feel that and your faith your faith
[1:29:13] never really grows and gives you that
[1:29:14] constant satisfaction
[1:29:16] you're never going to come closer to
[1:29:17] christ you're never going to grow your
[1:29:19] faith
[1:29:20] that's why in this i got to wrap this up
[1:29:22] brother says come back to the word
[1:29:24] everything must come back to the word
[1:29:26] brother braham said every true sign of
[1:29:28] god is followed by the voice of god
[1:29:30] every true sign of god is followed by
[1:29:32] the voice of god let me put that in the
[1:29:34] realm of a major gift or some sort of
[1:29:35] major demonstration if there's any big
[1:29:38] sign that gets your attention that
[1:29:40] transcends some sort of common natural
[1:29:42] occurrence look for the voice behind it
[1:29:44] because any true signs followed by the
[1:29:45] voice of god and the voice of god will
[1:29:47] line up with scripture or it'll open
[1:29:49] your eyes to the reality of that
[1:29:51] scripture that's how god works that's
[1:29:53] how god moves that's like the big major
[1:29:56] major example now just in by analogy any
[1:29:59] true sign that god is using to build
[1:30:02] your faith will not point back to the
[1:30:04] sign or the preacher or the meeting or
[1:30:07] the camp but it will point you right
[1:30:09] back to the word it'll have the voice of
[1:30:12] god following it every true sign think
[1:30:14] of it these signs shall follow them that
[1:30:16] believe and what will follow a true sign
[1:30:19] right back to the voice again amen
[1:30:22] it's in the word these signs will follow
[1:30:24] them that believe and say yeah and what
[1:30:25] follows the signs is the voice of god
[1:30:27] right comes right back to it that's good
[1:30:30] and queen of sheba many people are
[1:30:31] following signs it isn't the sign it's
[1:30:33] the voice that goes with the sign
[1:30:35] moses when he was given two signs god
[1:30:36] told him if they won't hear the voice of
[1:30:38] the first sign and they'll hear the
[1:30:39] voice of the second sign
[1:30:40] each sign is just
[1:30:42] a sign
[1:30:44] uh
[1:30:45] can i just humor you for a moment not to
[1:30:46] turn this into a stand-up comedy
[1:30:50] but i honestly told myself for once i'm
[1:30:52] going to be short today
[1:30:55] i did i was like this is going to be
[1:30:56] awesome we're going to be done we're
[1:30:57] going to rest this afternoon and it's
[1:30:59] 1202.
[1:31:02] i mean at least i'm aware right
[1:31:06] very self-aware
[1:31:08] and and sometimes i be honest if if i'm
[1:31:10] ever making you uncomfortable or
[1:31:12] belaboring you or you're kind of you're
[1:31:13] fed up or
[1:31:15] there's something don't like let's just
[1:31:16] talk about it i mean not right now
[1:31:19] let's talk about it
[1:31:20] because i'm sensitive my brother and
[1:31:22] this happens that happens or it's going
[1:31:23] there's my kids this let's talk about it
[1:31:26] because this is about this really is
[1:31:27] about you because if you weren't here i
[1:31:28] wouldn't be here i'm here because of you
[1:31:31] so i'm very sensitive to what you need
[1:31:32] as a body and i may be the pastor but
[1:31:34] i'm not i'm the one that is following
[1:31:37] the christ the leadership christ and his
[1:31:39] leadership has you in mind
[1:31:42] so with that i'm going to continue to
[1:31:43] preach more than an hour and a half
[1:31:46] he says each sign is just a sign man has
[1:31:49] gifts and things but watch what's behind
[1:31:51] it i hope this is coming to that balance
[1:31:54] that signs will follow them that believe
[1:31:56] well signs can be manipulated they can
[1:31:58] be misused they can be misunderstood it
[1:32:00] can throw you into another place well
[1:32:01] then what do we do what do we do well
[1:32:03] you got to come back to the word
[1:32:05] that's what that's what it must point
[1:32:07] back to it must point back to the word
[1:32:09] you got to come back to the word the
[1:32:10] sign should point you back to the word
[1:32:12] if it's not a scriptural sign if you
[1:32:13] don't know what to do it's like that
[1:32:14] seems really odd that you prayed that in
[1:32:16] the morning if your car was upside down
[1:32:18] on its roof that that would mean this
[1:32:20] that or the other like i don't know
[1:32:21] where to place that in the scripture
[1:32:22] what you wanted or what you asked for
[1:32:24] leave it alone
[1:32:25] that's between them and whoever prayed
[1:32:28] so you're coming back to the word and
[1:32:29] then he's showing us that now because
[1:32:31] what happens it's this the voice the
[1:32:33] word will follow the sign
[1:32:35] because that's what he wanted you to do
[1:32:37] in in the end is come to him the word
[1:32:39] so he's saying
[1:32:41] he says that
[1:32:43] man has gifts but watch what's behind it
[1:32:45] satan can impersonate anything almost
[1:32:47] he's an impersonator and he can
[1:32:48] impersonate but watch the kind of voice
[1:32:50] that it is what does it do
[1:32:53] the voice of the sign
[1:32:55] take a person walk up big when they what
[1:32:57] they can do and all and all this thing
[1:32:59] don't you pay no attention to that
[1:33:02] what's he talking about that boasting
[1:33:03] that braggadocio the bragging after the
[1:33:05] signs the pointing to the person and we
[1:33:07] did this and we did that pointing to
[1:33:09] some movement trying to vindicate this
[1:33:11] right here this is this is where it's
[1:33:13] happening and this is what it is kind of
[1:33:14] something you recognize those platitudes
[1:33:16] where it's almost as if now all the
[1:33:18] attention is trying to be shifted away
[1:33:19] from the word of god to this the new
[1:33:22] shiny
[1:33:23] flashy thing
[1:33:25] watch that because he says notice this
[1:33:27] god's spirit is a meek spirit humble
[1:33:29] spirit full of love and compassion
[1:33:31] looking to all people and bringing all
[1:33:32] people to a knowledge of
[1:33:34] christ so it's that you're you're
[1:33:36] watching what follows
[1:33:39] in the voice of the sign brother man
[1:33:40] says we find out that god gave moses the
[1:33:41] signs to prove claims and callings
[1:33:43] that's what he gave him for to prove
[1:33:45] and every true sign every true sign that
[1:33:47] sent from god has a voice behind it now
[1:33:50] don't fail this is my last lesson on
[1:33:52] this every true sign
[1:33:54] now we have signs that's not from god
[1:33:57] satan can almost impersonate anything
[1:33:59] that there is but a true sign sent from
[1:34:01] god has the voice of god behind it
[1:34:06] so we're in a in a quandary well brother
[1:34:08] aaron you've really you got us all
[1:34:09] excited about signs and now we're not so
[1:34:11] sure we don't know what you should go by
[1:34:12] anymore go by the word
[1:34:14] what's the voice that follows the signs
[1:34:17] is it trying to bring you back to a
[1:34:18] pentecostal message is it kind of
[1:34:20] signaling
[1:34:21] it when you look at well this is this is
[1:34:23] what it pertains to this is what it
[1:34:24] points to this is what it leads to you
[1:34:27] can have enough discernment to recognize
[1:34:28] that isn't that what jesus cast to get
[1:34:30] him for you could discern the skies and
[1:34:31] you can do all sorts of things and
[1:34:33] predict but you can't even look at
[1:34:34] something that's happening in a
[1:34:36] spiritual realm and say well i know
[1:34:37] exactly what this is pointing to
[1:34:40] is it trying to bring you to an
[1:34:41] organization is it trying to point you
[1:34:43] to some sort of man's kingdom is it
[1:34:44] wanting you to deny the bible as the
[1:34:46] absolute is it trying to get you to deny
[1:34:47] the word of god is it wanting to add to
[1:34:49] or take away look at what it's pointing
[1:34:51] to
[1:34:55] in the message going beyond the camp
[1:34:59] the subtitled going beyond 1205.
[1:35:02] as i look and preach across the nation
[1:35:04] and watch the people i am fully
[1:35:06] persuaded that the people are not
[1:35:07] getting to christ
[1:35:10] i just focus now i got i got this
[1:35:11] statement
[1:35:12] and uh john can you just do me a favor
[1:35:14] and just cycle forward through the
[1:35:16] remaining slides we can count it's one
[1:35:19] for the next one
[1:35:22] well no i want to do it together some of
[1:35:23] us aren't good at math just kind of just
[1:35:25] arrow through here this is all we have
[1:35:26] left keep going just keep going all the
[1:35:28] way in see look
[1:35:30] all right then one more quote look at
[1:35:31] this
[1:35:34] we're almost there
[1:35:37] going beyond the camp i'm fully
[1:35:39] persuaded that people are not getting to
[1:35:40] christ and i believe that it's the enemy
[1:35:43] that's thrown this hindrance
[1:35:45] the reason i believe this is he's not
[1:35:47] the object that they have been pointed
[1:35:49] to
[1:35:52] they have either been pointed to a dogma
[1:35:54] or a doctrine or a party or experience
[1:35:56] or a sensation or something like that
[1:35:58] instead of being pointed to christ the
[1:36:00] word
[1:36:02] god let us never be guilty of this
[1:36:06] that's why i think that the people are
[1:36:08] resting their eternal destination upon
[1:36:10] some dogma or some sensation
[1:36:12] it's because of what their loop is
[1:36:14] pointing to
[1:36:16] a dogma they can be very legalistic to
[1:36:18] be very cold very formal it's the wrong
[1:36:20] kind of legalist feedback loop
[1:36:23] or it can tend to the fanaticism some
[1:36:25] sort of party or experience or sensation
[1:36:28] they're resting their eternal
[1:36:29] destination on some dogma or some
[1:36:31] sensation like some say i danced in the
[1:36:33] spirit i spoke with tongues i felt fire
[1:36:34] run over me and do you know all those
[1:36:36] things can be impersonated by the devil
[1:36:39] there's just one thing he cannot
[1:36:41] impersonate that's the word
[1:36:43] in the debate between he and jesus each
[1:36:45] time jesus defeated him it is written
[1:36:47] the word
[1:36:48] and i believe today that the reason that
[1:36:51] people are not coming to christ is
[1:36:53] because they're pointed many of them to
[1:36:55] a denomination
[1:36:56] you come join our church or you read our
[1:36:58] catechism or believe our doctrine or
[1:37:01] some system of some sort and that's what
[1:37:03] i charted in signs to signs that's a
[1:37:05] system it's a closed system
[1:37:07] it's a self-confirming feedback loop
[1:37:10] that's completely left god's system
[1:37:13] that'll always point you back to christ
[1:37:15] a major
[1:37:16] v major and a minor
[1:37:19] always going to come back to christ
[1:37:25] they are pointed
[1:37:26] in
[1:37:28] the wrong way
[1:37:30] the signs been shifted
[1:37:33] it used to say christ this way
[1:37:35] but now the sign points to another sign
[1:37:39] and you go to this sign
[1:37:40] it points you to this side and you go
[1:37:42] this side boy we're getting somewhere
[1:37:44] aren't we in this awesome
[1:37:46] i'm loving this laodicean time
[1:37:49] come on
[1:37:50] sign decide to sign to sign
[1:37:55] let us never be guilty
[1:37:58] of not pointing to christ
[1:38:01] let it be real and everything we say
[1:38:03] everything we believe in everything we
[1:38:04] do it's christ the word
[1:38:06] that has the preeminence
[1:38:09] god bless us i'm just going to read this
[1:38:11] last statement if you counted the slides
[1:38:12] you know how many are left
[1:38:15] and this will just go
[1:38:16] lord will and just
[1:38:18] sum up
[1:38:19] the foundational part
[1:38:21] of christ my healer and then i want to i
[1:38:24] want to teach things from this message
[1:38:26] to
[1:38:26] that can get us to believe all things
[1:38:28] are possible
[1:38:29] for healing
[1:38:31] there's a lot of needs that we're facing
[1:38:33] physically even in our own church or
[1:38:34] family members
[1:38:36] and i believe god's going to come on the
[1:38:37] scene for us
[1:38:40] chapter 5 of the church age book he's
[1:38:41] quoting from matthew chapter 7 verses 21
[1:38:44] to 23 many shall come to me in that day
[1:38:46] and say
[1:38:47] and he says the evidence of receiving
[1:38:48] the holy ghost today is just the same as
[1:38:50] it was back in the day of our lord it is
[1:38:52] receiving the word of truth for the day
[1:38:54] in which you live
[1:38:57] jesus never did stress the importance of
[1:38:59] the works as he did the word
[1:39:02] he knew that if the people got the word
[1:39:04] the works would follow
[1:39:06] that is bible
[1:39:10] now i want you to recognize this pattern
[1:39:12] now jesus knew that there was going to
[1:39:14] be a terrible drift away from the word
[1:39:16] in the burgundian age which was that
[1:39:19] yeah as a yet 200 years off from the
[1:39:20] patmos vision
[1:39:22] he knew that drift would cause them to
[1:39:24] go into the dark ages
[1:39:27] remember brother braham is reading this
[1:39:29] after matthew chapter 7 many shall come
[1:39:32] to me in that day and say i've done
[1:39:33] these many wonderful works so what
[1:39:36] starts the drift
[1:39:39] where does the drift begin
[1:39:42] he knew that the way man would
[1:39:44] originally get away from god was by
[1:39:46] first leaving the word and if you leave
[1:39:48] that word you've left god
[1:39:51] thus he's presented himself to the
[1:39:52] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[1:39:55] churches of all ages
[1:39:58] whether you're in a scientific age
[1:39:59] whether you're in a party age whether
[1:40:00] you're in experience camp whether
[1:40:02] whatever camp you're in whatever
[1:40:03] fanaticism you're going for whatever
[1:40:05] legalism you're in bondage to he
[1:40:07] presents himself as thus because the way
[1:40:10] that you end up in darkness is you
[1:40:11] deviate from the word and the drift can
[1:40:14] begin not just by getting cold and
[1:40:17] formal and slouching and becoming very
[1:40:20] harsh and rigid and legalistic and
[1:40:21] denying signs but you can also begin to
[1:40:24] drift when all you do is follow signs
[1:40:28] and next thing you know you've drifted
[1:40:29] from the truth he says here he is his
[1:40:31] presentation this is what we want to do
[1:40:33] this is what we want to receive i am the
[1:40:35] word
[1:40:38] i am the word
[1:40:40] if you want deity in your midst
[1:40:44] then welcome and receive the word
[1:40:46] you want healing here receive the healer
[1:40:50] don't let anyone or anything get between
[1:40:53] you and that word
[1:40:55] this which i am giving you the word is a
[1:40:57] revelation of myself i am the word
[1:40:59] remember that let us never forget this
[1:41:02] christ is the ultimate he is what we
[1:41:04] want if we want him above all recognize
[1:41:08] this that in christ
[1:41:10] he is he is in christ he is the giver
[1:41:13] therefore in him or all gifts whether it
[1:41:15] be healing whether it be salvation
[1:41:17] whatever it is it is in christ and as it
[1:41:20] is lip services paid time and time again
[1:41:23] i don't want the gifts i want the giver
[1:41:25] listen we mean it for real we are the
[1:41:27] ones who have seen the sign demonstrated
[1:41:30] we are the ones that have heard the
[1:41:32] voice crying that christ himself has
[1:41:34] descended the shout has gone forth
[1:41:37] christ the living bread of life is
[1:41:39] drawing a bride to himself and i want to
[1:41:42] receive him knowing that in him is
[1:41:44] everything
[1:41:47] and in christ is my self-sufficiency
[1:41:52] and if i have him then i have the giver
[1:41:55] of every good gift
[1:41:57] every precious thing
[1:41:59] and if i have him
[1:42:00] i have all i need
[1:42:04] and if you want deity in your midst
[1:42:05] welcome
[1:42:07] and receive the word
[1:42:09] that's why he several statements later
[1:42:12] he
[1:42:13] he poses the question i really wonder if
[1:42:15] we're sufficiently impressed
[1:42:17] with the deity that is in our midst
[1:42:21] signs can be impressive right
[1:42:25] but i want the word
[1:42:27] and i want to be sufficiently impressed
