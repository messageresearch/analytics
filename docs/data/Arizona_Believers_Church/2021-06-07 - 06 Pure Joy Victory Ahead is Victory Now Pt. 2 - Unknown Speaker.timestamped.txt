[0:00] hebrews chapter 12 verse 1
[0:03] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[0:05] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[0:07] let us lay aside every weight and the
[0:10] sin which doth so easily beset us
[0:13] and let us run with patience the race
[0:15] that is set before us
[0:17] looking unto jesus the author and
[0:19] finisher of our faith
[0:21] who for the joy that was set before him
[0:23] endured the cross
[0:24] despising the shame and is set down at
[0:26] the right hand of the throne of god
[0:29] for consider him that endured such
[0:31] contradiction of sinners it means
[0:33] bitter hostility against himself lest ye
[0:36] be wearied
[0:37] and faint in your minds amen we desire
[0:41] that god would bless
[0:42] the words which we've read you can be
[0:43] seated
[0:48] we're continuing on the subject of pure
[0:50] joy and
[0:52] the title of victory ahead is victory
[0:54] now
[0:55] and pure joy is the joy of the lord
[0:58] there's no other way of looking at it
[1:00] and we know the joy of the lord is our
[1:02] strength and the pure joy that we're
[1:03] identifying
[1:04] is the joy of the lord and it's a joy
[1:06] that he gives and we find in the
[1:08] scripture that the joy that he gives
[1:10] no man shall take away from you so it's
[1:12] a joy that you have a right to it's a
[1:14] joy that you ought to be able to believe
[1:15] is yours
[1:16] it's your possession and uh you don't
[1:18] need to let somebody steal
[1:20] that joy and we are looking at these
[1:22] three verses in
[1:24] the book of hebrews and in chapter verse
[1:27] 2 it says looking unto jesus
[1:29] the author and finisher of our faith so
[1:32] there's a beginning and there's a
[1:33] perfecting
[1:34] and so there's an in-between there's a
[1:35] process where it's developing
[1:37] and it says so we're looking to jesus
[1:39] and then paul wants us to recognize
[1:41] these two things
[1:42] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:45] endured the cross
[1:46] despising the shame disregarding it
[1:50] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:52] throne of god so
[1:53] and then in the next verse it says so
[1:55] consider him so you're looking unto him
[1:57] and you're considering him and it points
[1:59] out that he endured death he disregarded
[2:01] shame
[2:02] and he could deal with the bitter
[2:05] hostility
[2:06] all because of the joy that was set
[2:09] before him
[2:10] and so there's a joy set before him as
[2:12] he's enduring bitter hostility
[2:14] there's a joy set before him as he's
[2:15] facing death and
[2:17] with that joy set before him we see
[2:19] where he ends up he ends up
[2:20] at the right hand of the throne of god
[2:23] and we saw how that even
[2:26] with respect when we were looking at the
[2:27] scripture on wednesday night how that
[2:29] rachel had a son and called him man of
[2:31] sorrow
[2:32] but then israel says no he shall be the
[2:34] son of my right hand we see this
[2:36] expressed in christ
[2:37] a contradiction of sinners we see this
[2:40] hostility and even death and
[2:42] disregarding the shame of that death
[2:44] and he went to the cross and died with
[2:46] the joy that was set before him and now
[2:49] he's set at the right
[2:50] hand of the throne of god and we broke
[2:52] it up in this way and we're just
[2:54] backgrounding a little bit for a few
[2:55] moments here at the outset
[2:57] how the we could see this snapshot of
[3:00] his life where his present circumstances
[3:02] were bitter hostility shame and death
[3:05] that's what he was going through
[3:06] literally
[3:07] enduring those things but then his
[3:09] future circumstances was to be at the
[3:11] right hand
[3:12] of the right hand of the throne of god
[3:13] so he has his present circumstances
[3:15] and he has his future circumstances and
[3:18] so the joy of christ the source of his
[3:21] joy
[3:22] was his hope it wasn't oh he loved
[3:26] being beaten and he loved dying and he
[3:27] loved the shame and so it's instructive
[3:30] to us
[3:30] because we say well this is difficult
[3:32] and persecution is hard and rejection
[3:34] hurts and it's painful when this happens
[3:36] and
[3:36] and i don't like it when that happens
[3:38] you're not supposed to love those things
[3:40] that's not what joy means of the joy of
[3:42] the lord and if you're and well you just
[3:44] don't have any faith if that bothers you
[3:46] no that's not what faith means
[3:48] faith is not the absence of some
[3:49] contrary emotion and faith is not the
[3:51] absence of being uncomfortable
[3:53] and neither is joy the absence of pain
[3:55] or sorrow but it's having something
[3:57] deeper and more settled than any of that
[3:59] and that's what christ had is his hope
[4:02] was his the source of his joy and that's
[4:05] why paul says look to him
[4:07] look to him look to jesus look at what
[4:09] he did and how he could go through
[4:11] bitter hostility and
[4:12] and disregard the shame and even submit
[4:15] himself to death so he says
[4:16] look to him and he says consider him so
[4:19] this is what we want to do we want to
[4:21] look to jesus as
[4:22] the author and finish of our faith who
[4:24] had this particular way that he
[4:26] approached
[4:27] his difficulties and his challenges and
[4:29] it's what gave him
[4:30] the right conduct in the midst of
[4:32] everything that he was going through
[4:34] and so we we placed it this way
[4:36] something about his future
[4:39] changed the way his present was
[4:41] characterized
[4:43] he who for the joy that was set before
[4:44] him he endured in the present tense
[4:47] who for the situations that he was
[4:49] enduring and the situations that he was
[4:50] facing
[4:51] was able to go through difficulties and
[4:54] and overcome the situation he was in so
[4:56] something about his future
[4:58] was changing his present tense and
[5:00] that's why we take this statement
[5:02] victory ahead is victory now that if we
[5:05] know that we're going to ultimately win
[5:07] then there's no point we're losing
[5:09] because it's all part of the outcome i
[5:11] say oh well you were down and this was
[5:13] happened and you were behind and you
[5:14] were
[5:15] you had this take place and you had this
[5:17] taken away from you there's nothing you
[5:18] haven't lost here that's not already won
[5:20] back there
[5:21] and that's what redemption is all about
[5:23] so no matter what snapshot you might
[5:24] want to take in someone's life and said
[5:26] oh they're defeated and they're downcast
[5:28] and they're rejected no if they
[5:30] ultimately win they're always winning
[5:32] and so victory ahead if we can believe
[5:34] and be convinced
[5:35] of an ultimate victory then we can
[5:37] believe and that we are victorious now
[5:39] and conduct ourselves accordingly
[5:42] and as we were looking at how there's a
[5:44] little bit of a misunderstanding that
[5:45] perception is reality
[5:47] and how that our perception does not
[5:50] change reality
[5:51] but our perception of our circumstances
[5:53] typically
[5:54] determines our state of mind or our
[5:56] condition within that
[5:59] our reality so if we perceive something
[6:01] a certain way then we're going to react
[6:03] towards what we perceive if we perceive
[6:04] a threat
[6:05] we're going to act a fearful or we're
[6:06] going to run or we're going to flee or
[6:08] maybe get paralyzed
[6:09] or maybe we'll fight if we perceive
[6:11] something a certain way we're going to
[6:12] act accordingly
[6:14] and so that's important to understand
[6:16] that what you perceive what you
[6:17] understand and what you know
[6:19] determines how that you'll act and what
[6:21] we're wanting to identify and point to
[6:23] is that we can perceive something
[6:24] greater than the circumstances that
[6:27] we're presently in we can perceive
[6:28] something beyond
[6:30] what's natural and beyond these five
[6:32] senses to determine our state
[6:34] of mind and our condition within this
[6:36] present reality
[6:38] because our joy is not the product of
[6:40] our current circumstances
[6:42] but our joy as we're calling it the pure
[6:44] joy is a condition
[6:46] that can be influenced by your future
[6:49] and this may be seen
[6:50] where it's paradoxical and also i
[6:52] realized as i was pondering over this
[6:54] weekend
[6:55] that it may be uh stating the obvious
[6:58] and if it's stating the obvious and just
[7:00] kind of well this is not anything we
[7:02] don't already know then i would say that
[7:04] from my vantage point as i look at it if
[7:06] it's something we already know
[7:08] then it's something i want to fully
[7:10] implement and rely on and rest
[7:12] in as to the way that i conduct myself
[7:15] in my everyday relationships and the
[7:16] situations that i'm in
[7:18] to believe that right now my emotions my
[7:20] state of mind and my conduct
[7:22] can be influenced not by all the
[7:24] symptoms and circumstances that surround
[7:26] me
[7:26] in this natural world but by an eternal
[7:29] condition
[7:30] and by a truth and a promise that exists
[7:32] beyond these senses
[7:35] he said i have not seen nor ear heard
[7:37] neither entered into the heart of men
[7:38] the things which god has prepared for
[7:40] them that love him
[7:42] he says but he's revealed it to us
[7:45] by his spirit why does he reveal us
[7:47] things that are prepared why does he
[7:49] reveal us things that are
[7:50] forward-looking
[7:51] why does he reveal us things that are in
[7:52] the future so that the future can
[7:54] impact our present he reveals it to us
[7:57] now because it it ought to
[7:59] cause us to act it might ought to cause
[8:01] us to think a certain way and live a
[8:03] certain way
[8:04] that the same principle applies why he
[8:06] doesn't show us something sometimes
[8:08] you ever wondered why didn't he show me
[8:09] that why didn't he tell me this was
[8:11] going to happen it really would have
[8:12] been nice to know beforehand
[8:13] because god knew that if he showed you
[8:15] too soon you might not have the right
[8:16] response
[8:18] or he knew that if you knew that it
[8:19] would change the way that you would act
[8:21] and god is
[8:22] shaping things and forming things and
[8:24] guiding things to bring a past
[8:25] his perfect will and so the same
[8:27] principle applies and that he shows you
[8:29] things
[8:30] because he wants it to change what
[8:31] you're doing now change your mindset
[8:33] change your attitude
[8:34] and give you a hope for the future and
[8:36] so the reality of eternity should press
[8:39] itself
[8:40] into our reality now the reality of
[8:43] eternity
[8:44] ought to influence how we think how we
[8:46] act how we feel
[8:47] how we conduct ourselves in present
[8:49] tense
[8:50] because the things that are to be are
[8:51] supposed to change the way things are
[8:54] we could spend a lot of time looking at
[8:56] how that virtual reality
[8:58] synthetic reality and and the
[9:01] the the things that are presented to us
[9:04] as a replacement for
[9:06] literal contact with human beings and
[9:08] real people and real interactions
[9:10] and things becoming virtual and more
[9:12] through media
[9:13] and through the uh immersing ourselves
[9:15] in something that is
[9:16] digital how that that's actually
[9:18] changing the way we think in the way
[9:20] that we act and the way that we interact
[9:22] with real things for me i had this
[9:24] happen several years ago
[9:26] and went in that i realized just the
[9:28] impact technology was having on me
[9:30] when i was reading my bible and i did
[9:32] this
[9:35] i'm holding a physical bible and i use
[9:37] my thumb to scroll
[9:38] scroll the column and i was like wow
[9:40] this is
[9:41] this is changing the way that i interact
[9:44] i handed um
[9:45] i think i handed a picture to somebody
[9:47] one day and they tried to zoom on it
[9:48] zoom in on it
[9:50] no wow that's technology if you could
[9:53] manage to do that
[9:54] uh and it's because we it's changing the
[9:56] way that we interact it's changing the
[9:58] way that we think it's changing the way
[10:00] that people perceive themselves
[10:01] because things can be digitally altered
[10:04] and and i
[10:05] bring that up just to make this point if
[10:07] things that aren't real
[10:08] can change your actual behavior
[10:11] how much more ought things that are to
[10:14] be and are more real than the things
[10:16] that are
[10:17] change our behavior the things that are
[10:20] to be ought to
[10:20] influence and change the way that things
[10:22] are now and we ought to have this
[10:24] attitude to believe that our future
[10:26] will change our present and therefore we
[10:30] develop this
[10:31] discipline of faith where we're going to
[10:33] we're not going to reach into our past
[10:35] to define who we are now in our carnal
[10:37] past and our problems and our mistakes
[10:39] and our failures
[10:40] and our past interactions and our broken
[10:41] promises and everything that we've gone
[10:43] through we're not going to use our past
[10:45] to construct our perception of our
[10:47] reality and to define who we are
[10:49] present tense but we'll use revelation
[10:51] to be
[10:52] who we actually are and and be who we
[10:56] actually are
[10:56] even if circumstances don't change even
[10:59] if environment doesn't change if
[11:01] laodicea doesn't change if politics get
[11:03] worse
[11:03] if economics get worse if the social
[11:06] climate gets worse no matter what
[11:07] happens
[11:08] i can i can have this disposition and
[11:10] character within my heart to believe
[11:12] that i am going to become who i'm
[11:14] supposed to be
[11:15] by revelation of my future and not
[11:18] because of all the circumstances and
[11:20] symptoms that exist around me and
[11:22] therefore if i can do that i can rest
[11:24] joyfully i can joyfully rest i i can
[11:28] take rest
[11:29] in the joy of the lord and conduct
[11:30] myself in the midst of all these things
[11:32] that are taking place the right way
[11:35] and so it brings us to a statement that
[11:37] has formed part of the basis for this
[11:39] uh series on pure joy brother brown is
[11:42] talking about the love of god and how
[11:44] it's misunderstood
[11:46] and and they look to human
[11:47] characteristics and
[11:49] interpret human experience by human
[11:51] experience and even
[11:52] by your own feelings the love of god and
[11:54] how they miss the mark on god's love and
[11:56] he says we know that he loves us because
[11:58] he elected us and we'll come to that
[12:00] those points here in a moment but then
[12:02] he says how shall i prove my love to him
[12:05] by believing what he said and by
[12:07] conducting myself with joy
[12:09] admits the trials that he and his wisdom
[12:11] allows to come to pass
[12:13] now this is to me very personally a
[12:16] heavy statement
[12:17] that the proof of my love to god is the
[12:20] attitude that i carry
[12:21] when i go through something difficult i
[12:24] i'll just make the confession on my
[12:26] behalf and the neighbors next door
[12:30] there's not much proof that i love god
[12:32] at times if it's purely based upon how
[12:34] i'm going through conflict
[12:36] and how i'm handling adversity and how
[12:38] you doing brother and i don't you know i
[12:39] don't really appreciate what happened
[12:41] and i think this is bad and
[12:42] this is horrible and i can't believe
[12:43] they treated us that way and it's like
[12:45] whoa you don't really love god at all do
[12:47] you
[12:49] because this is this is actually saying
[12:50] that the proof of our love
[12:52] is that we believe what he said and we
[12:54] can all get rally around that faith
[12:55] faith yes we believe
[12:56] but then i must conduct myself with joy
[12:59] in all the trials i go through
[13:01] because all that if he permits the trial
[13:03] it's his wisdom that permitted it
[13:05] there's no
[13:06] unwise trial that slips by
[13:09] while he's over here trying to figure
[13:10] out brother mitch all of a sudden the
[13:12] trial gets onto you and oh no
[13:13] i didn't mean that to happen to sister
[13:15] so-and-so no that's not how it works
[13:17] anything he allows to happen is in his
[13:19] wisdom so then i have this
[13:21] uh instructions from the word of god it
[13:23] says in every trial
[13:25] in every situation shoulders back chin
[13:27] up
[13:29] conduct yourself with joy and then so i
[13:31] believe that there is
[13:33] an understanding then of what it means
[13:34] to conduct ourselves a joy
[13:36] and that we ought not to default to a
[13:38] bubbly personality
[13:40] or default to you know kind of a fake
[13:42] put on
[13:43] uh syrupy sappy uh you know persona when
[13:46] you're going through difficult things
[13:47] like
[13:48] how's everything going you know i just
[13:49] love it that my family hates me
[13:53] i've been waiting for this for 46 years
[13:56] and you know what it happened so you can
[13:59] you can believe
[14:00] you can believe for yourself that you'll
[14:02] be rejected and you'll be scorned and
[14:03] you'll be hated
[14:04] praying for you it doesn't it doesn't
[14:07] need to be that way
[14:08] it could just be hey you know what this
[14:11] is hard this is difficult
[14:12] but the joy of the lord is my strength i
[14:14] don't know how this is going to turn out
[14:16] and this is
[14:17] heartbreak even with tears of sorrow and
[14:19] weeping
[14:20] if if crying was a sin jesus was a
[14:22] sinner
[14:24] if sorrow was a sin then jesus was a
[14:26] sinner what if the bible teaches
[14:28] teaches he was without sin so sorrow's
[14:31] not a sin
[14:33] crying is not a sin
[14:37] and so the key then that brother branham
[14:39] connects this to and this is where i
[14:40] want to
[14:41] try to unpack and understand this
[14:43] commandment that conducting ourselves
[14:45] with joy
[14:46] the key to a joyful disposition he had
[14:49] already elicited it was god's elective
[14:51] love
[14:52] so the how can i conduct myself with joy
[14:55] without
[14:55] discussing what that might look like
[14:57] because all of us conduct ourselves
[14:58] differently
[14:59] i mentioned before brother who's a
[15:00] friend of mine that no matter what's
[15:02] taking place he kind of just is real
[15:04] even yeah
[15:04] today's the best day of my life and it
[15:07] really is
[15:08] and then years later yeah today is the
[15:10] worst day of my life i mean it's just
[15:11] even it's just the way they always are
[15:13] so it's not so much the outward
[15:14] demonstration
[15:16] but rather the inward peace and comfort
[15:18] that we all might have
[15:19] that's connected to so without getting
[15:22] into what it may look like what's it
[15:24] connected to
[15:25] what is this joy that we can have in the
[15:28] midst of the trials that he allows to
[15:29] come to pass
[15:30] it's connected with god's elective love
[15:33] and brother brahm said his love is
[15:35] elective which he had for us
[15:37] notice this phrase before the foundation
[15:40] of the world and this is where i want to
[15:42] start getting in
[15:43] identifying more how that if by being
[15:46] forward-looking we can allow the future
[15:48] and there was so much that we ministered
[15:49] on last time
[15:50] that i hope for most of you you had
[15:52] listened to that and and it's connecting
[15:54] very well
[15:54] that it's forward looking into eternity
[15:57] that bears itself on the present tense
[15:59] now
[15:59] now there's a way that i want you to
[16:00] look at that it's not so much looking
[16:03] forward in time because we're so much
[16:04] creatures of chronology and
[16:06] and how tech seconds tick off and things
[16:08] go move forward on a continuum
[16:10] but now it's something that precedes
[16:12] time
[16:14] it's something that is beyond time it's
[16:15] b it's not tied to light time and matter
[16:17] it's something that transcends those
[16:19] things
[16:20] and so the anchor for god's elective
[16:22] love and our understanding of it
[16:23] is his love which he had for us before
[16:26] the world began
[16:28] and in john chapter 3 verse 35 it writes
[16:31] this in kind of this descriptive summary
[16:34] uh introduction to the story of christ
[16:36] in the book of john the father loveth
[16:37] the son
[16:38] and have given all things into his hands
[16:41] so that god
[16:41] is characterized as loving the son
[16:45] and has given all things into his hand
[16:47] so jesus
[16:48] did not conduct himself with joy
[16:51] without a knowledge and understanding of
[16:53] the love that god had for him
[16:55] so he endured the shame he despised the
[16:57] shame he endured the cross he put up
[16:59] with bitter hostility
[17:00] for the joy that was set before him but
[17:02] that joy
[17:03] was not just kind of a hope so it was
[17:05] connected to the fact that he knew that
[17:07] god loved him
[17:08] brother madam even says about job that
[17:10] job loved god and he knew that god loved
[17:12] him
[17:14] and this is why job could endure and go
[17:15] through the things that he did is he he
[17:17] had a grip on god and hot
[17:19] god had a grip on him and he knew that
[17:21] god loved him and that he loved god
[17:23] and that could give him a particular
[17:25] attitude and no matter what he was going
[17:26] through because he was confident in the
[17:28] love of god
[17:29] jesus says in john chapter 5 verse 20
[17:31] for the father loveth the son
[17:33] and showeth him all things that himself
[17:36] doeth
[17:37] jesus is now confessing this that the
[17:39] father loves the son
[17:40] shows him all things that himself do it
[17:42] and then he this gives them confidence
[17:44] about the future
[17:45] and he will show him greater works than
[17:47] these that he may marvel
[17:49] he had this confidence in his
[17:50] relationship with the father
[17:52] that he who has shown me things before
[17:54] loves me and
[17:55] he'll continue to show me things in the
[17:57] future
[17:58] and so this confidence that existed in
[18:01] christ and how paul says looking unto
[18:03] him
[18:03] and considering him we need this type of
[18:06] confidence to conduct ourselves with
[18:08] authentic joy
[18:10] we need this kind of confidence we need
[18:12] this kind of assurance to conduct
[18:14] ourselves with joy and and it be a
[18:16] genuine joy and not a synthetic joy
[18:19] not a synthetic happiness that that we
[18:21] manufacture through dissonance and
[18:23] and we manufacture through all sorts of
[18:25] defense mechanisms but we need this kind
[18:27] of confidence
[18:28] that i fully understand that what has
[18:30] happened
[18:31] is difficult it is hard it is a loss it
[18:33] is it is
[18:34] true it is tribulation it is a trying it
[18:36] is suffering
[18:37] it is anguish it is painful but i know
[18:40] that he loves me and he will not
[18:42] suffer me to be tempted above that which
[18:44] i'm able i know that he's working all
[18:46] things for my good
[18:47] and you place your confidence in that
[18:49] nothing past present or future
[18:52] can separate me from the love of god
[18:56] that's the kind of confidence we need to
[18:58] conduct ourselves to joy
[19:00] in first john chapter 3 verses 20 to 21.
[19:09] it says for thought if our heart condemn
[19:11] us and it's talking about the love of
[19:12] god
[19:13] in in this past in these passages
[19:17] if our heart condemn us god is greater
[19:19] than our heart
[19:22] so if our heart is condemning us and
[19:24] that's condemning finds fault
[19:26] or blame or cues if your heart is
[19:28] accusing you
[19:29] if your heart is finding fault if your
[19:32] heart feels blame
[19:34] he says god is greater than our heart
[19:37] and then the next phrase is the phrase
[19:39] to me that stands out the most
[19:41] and knoweth all things because our heart
[19:45] is what retains knowledge and
[19:47] information if we could say it resides
[19:49] within our spirits and our emotions
[19:51] and so conscience memory reason and
[19:53] affection are all these elements of our
[19:55] heart
[19:56] so if all these things condemn us he
[19:58] said god is greater than our hearts
[20:01] and regardless of what you think you
[20:03] know in your mind
[20:04] he knows all things
[20:08] so the fact that what he's want us to
[20:09] understand is yes our heart may con
[20:11] your heart may condemn you but god's
[20:13] greater than that and has a knowledge
[20:15] that will cast
[20:16] down the condemnation god is greater
[20:19] than your heart
[20:20] and he knows all things and what he
[20:22] knows
[20:24] destroys the lies that your heart is
[20:26] telling
[20:29] he says beloved if our heart condemn us
[20:30] not then we have confidence towards god
[20:34] now i know that we read this and we read
[20:36] it in the sense to say
[20:37] oh well i guess i have to get rid of my
[20:39] condemning heart
[20:41] before i can have confidence with god
[20:43] and so he said oh well if i have a heart
[20:45] that convinces me then i obviously don't
[20:46] trust god and let's just be honest we
[20:48] take it that way
[20:49] right we can read the scriptures
[20:51] sometimes where it says oh well then
[20:53] if uh i don't really as we were
[20:55] mentioned before well if i
[20:56] conduct myself very poorly in a trial
[20:58] that i have well then you don't really
[20:59] love god
[21:00] no that's not that's not the point or
[21:02] the emphasis the emphasis is
[21:04] you know that he loves you and just let
[21:07] that have preeminence and you'll act
[21:09] differently
[21:10] and if you're not acting differently
[21:12] it's not because you don't love god it's
[21:13] because you're forgetting just how much
[21:15] he loves you or need to know it more
[21:18] and that which is going to be gap the
[21:19] love that you have for him so it's not
[21:21] that you don't love god if you don't
[21:22] behave well
[21:23] it's that you're not realizing the power
[21:25] and potential of the love that you have
[21:27] so instead of reading this well if your
[21:28] heart condemns you then you don't have
[21:30] confidence towards god
[21:31] let's invert it
[21:35] if you have confidence towards god don't
[21:37] let your heart condemn you
[21:39] because if your heart doesn't condemn
[21:41] you then that can only be be because you
[21:44] have a greater confidence
[21:46] in god who knows all things regardless
[21:48] of what your emotional state's telling
[21:50] you
[21:51] regardless of what your memory tells you
[21:52] your affection reason and conscience in
[21:54] these things
[21:55] if my heart is not condemning me it's
[21:57] because the confidence i have in god is
[21:59] greater
[22:01] and so our heart condemns us it finds
[22:02] fault it blames
[22:04] and listen our accusing hearts are full
[22:06] of what's called adverse knowledge
[22:08] knowledge that is against our best
[22:10] interest
[22:12] knowledge which is to our ill or to our
[22:14] bad or for our shame
[22:16] can we all admit to that and we won't
[22:18] pull up anybody's social media accounts
[22:20] right now to prove it but we have we
[22:22] have pictures we have
[22:24] posts we have memories we have all sorts
[22:26] of things we have a past
[22:27] all of us who've come here have a past
[22:29] that is not perfect and sinless
[22:32] and so we have gone through
[22:33] circumstances and situations and maybe
[22:35] not even the things that are overt
[22:37] just the thoughts that we wrestle with
[22:39] can condemn us
[22:41] yeah i haven't gone out and done it but
[22:42] boy i sure wished i could have i sure
[22:44] wish this would have happened and
[22:45] struggle with this and i struggle with
[22:46] that we have all these things which
[22:48] become
[22:49] knowledge adverse knowledge in hearts
[22:50] that become accusers and this is how i'm
[22:54] wanting to kind of understand it in
[22:56] uh this the sequence or how chronology
[22:59] can unfold
[23:00] are negative thoughts about what's to
[23:02] come
[23:04] and so we're not we're not looking
[23:05] forward to things we become apprehensive
[23:07] about the future our negative thoughts
[23:08] about
[23:09] how we are now or even about our future
[23:11] are reinforced by our painful memories
[23:14] or our past experiences
[23:16] so we we feel we we're uncomfortable
[23:18] about the future because
[23:19] what's happened in the past there's a
[23:21] statement in the law that says you owe
[23:23] you always draft according to your last
[23:25] deal so if you're a contract lawyer
[23:27] and you're drafting a contract you're
[23:29] going to draft the contract you're
[23:30] presently riding
[23:32] based upon how the last deal worked out
[23:34] based on how the last
[23:36] contract worked out so the contract that
[23:39] i
[23:39] signed for the hilton garden inn looks a
[23:41] lot different than the one i had
[23:42] previously signed
[23:44] because i'm drafting i'm drafting based
[23:47] upon that so now i have liquidated
[23:48] damages provisions i have them required
[23:50] to go i hope they're not streaming this
[23:52] they're required to go out and find me a
[23:54] replacement if they can't they need to
[23:55] pay me the difference when i rented the
[23:56] phoenix convention center
[24:00] why because prior experience is
[24:02] informing me now
[24:03] and now i'm active better cover myself
[24:05] better do this better do that
[24:06] so prior experience influences things
[24:08] you've happened things that you've been
[24:09] through think heartaches and
[24:11] disappointments and all those things
[24:12] begin to inform us how we feel now
[24:14] but then it also begins to shape our
[24:17] expectations
[24:18] and our anticipation about the future so
[24:20] it's painful memories past experiences
[24:22] these different things
[24:23] or disappointments are informing our
[24:26] perception
[24:26] as we go forward or as we think about
[24:28] going forward
[24:30] but notice how that the bible john now
[24:32] addresses this in the next chapter
[24:34] first john chapter 4 verses 16 to 19.
[24:37] and and he says it was such absolute
[24:39] terms and i believe we ought to be the
[24:40] same way
[24:41] and we have known and believed the love
[24:43] that god hath to us
[24:45] i want to have that kind of confidence i
[24:47] know and believe the love that he has
[24:49] for us
[24:49] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[24:53] dwelleth in god and god in him herein
[24:56] is our love made perfect that we may
[24:59] have boldness in the day of judgment
[25:01] this is where it pays off
[25:03] this is when it really when it really
[25:05] manifests itself wherein was faith
[25:07] abraham the faith of abraham made
[25:09] perfect when he offered isaac
[25:12] in other words it wasn't that he had
[25:13] deficient faith to that moment but
[25:15] that's when it really paid off that's
[25:16] when it really manifested
[25:18] what it was he said this is how our
[25:20] faith is made perfect our love is made
[25:21] perfect
[25:22] that we may have boldness in the day of
[25:24] judgment because as he is
[25:26] so are we in this world
[25:29] well what is he is he full of fear
[25:33] is he full of doubt and worry and
[25:34] trepidation is he anxious no
[25:37] so as he is so are we present tense in
[25:40] this world
[25:42] there is no fear in love
[25:45] but perfect love casteth out fear
[25:49] now again let's invert this in the sense
[25:51] that don't say well if i fear i don't
[25:52] have perfect love
[25:53] because that's how the devil works on us
[25:55] well if you fear you don't have perfect
[25:56] love
[25:58] but it's telling us that the perfect
[26:00] love you have
[26:01] ought to cast out fear we don't have to
[26:04] give it any place it says because fear
[26:06] have torment
[26:07] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[26:09] love we love him because he
[26:11] first loved us so our wholeness our
[26:14] wellness
[26:15] our sound mind matters and how that
[26:18] perfect love
[26:18] cast out fear because if you had perfect
[26:22] love and still feared you would be
[26:23] incomplete
[26:26] so perfect love exists to drive out fear
[26:31] fear brings the thought of punishment
[26:34] or negative consequence fear or dread of
[26:37] abandonment or or
[26:38] fear is a distressing emotion when
[26:41] you're fearful or something you're
[26:42] afraid of a negative
[26:43] impact you're not afraid of something
[26:46] that can't harm you
[26:48] you're not really worried if the stock
[26:49] market crashes unless you have some risk
[26:52] exposure in the market if you're living
[26:54] off the grid in a tent in sabino canyon
[26:57] i don't care what happens in the stock
[26:58] market hey
[27:00] i'm not tied to it but we fear if we
[27:03] recognize there's some consequence
[27:05] or negative impact based upon a certain
[27:07] outcome or a certain action
[27:08] so fear is a distressing emotion that
[27:10] brings a dread and so if we have a fear
[27:12] of rejection a fear of abandonment as it
[27:14] relates to our fear
[27:16] the wrong kind of fear towards god will
[27:18] he reject me will he abandon me
[27:20] is he going to punish me and so you live
[27:22] in the sphere that if something happens
[27:23] maybe
[27:24] god is finally calling on something and
[27:26] saying well you asked for it buddy
[27:27] you're going to get it
[27:30] we don't have to go any further than our
[27:31] childhood memories to know what that
[27:33] feels like
[27:36] and i i guess i'd like to say it this
[27:38] way it's amazing
[27:42] how that we can live in in the with this
[27:45] fear that our past is going to catch up
[27:47] to us
[27:51] and that we're constantly living right
[27:53] now and we're living in
[27:54] today present tense right now but we're
[27:57] living with this fear that somehow
[27:59] what's happened in the past
[28:01] is going to overwhelm us and catch up to
[28:03] us
[28:04] and in doing so we're letting the past
[28:06] steal our present
[28:09] it's gone it's history we can't do
[28:10] anything about it but we we use the fear
[28:13] of it our interpretation of it our
[28:15] perception of it
[28:16] we use the we let the past we're living
[28:19] under the cloud of it we're living under
[28:20] the
[28:21] the darkness of it we're living under
[28:22] the consequences of it and we can't ever
[28:24] seem to outrun it like no matter what
[28:26] happens
[28:26] i'm a victim of my past mistakes no
[28:28] matter what happens i'm always going to
[28:30] have this shadowed over me i'm always
[28:31] going to let it uh it's always
[28:33] foreboding so if you're always honored
[28:34] how can you look forward and see light
[28:36] at the end of the tunnel
[28:37] this rain cloud is always going to be
[28:39] there this feeling is always going to be
[28:41] there
[28:41] and so it's amazing how we can let the
[28:43] past continue to have power over us
[28:46] and so i want to identify this the theme
[28:48] and things that are to be or one of the
[28:49] things that
[28:50] themes that is in things that are to be
[28:52] is that eternal life
[28:55] gives purpose and meaning to our present
[28:57] lives
[28:59] when i say eternal life i i'm not only
[29:01] referring to the eternal life you
[29:02] possess now by the new birth
[29:04] but i'm also talking about the life that
[29:05] will live in eternity
[29:07] and this is something that brother
[29:08] branham's identifying that there's
[29:10] something about this eternal life
[29:12] in this life that's beyond this one that
[29:14] is so powerful and so overwhelming
[29:17] that we ought to let that
[29:20] overwhelm us and the brightness of our
[29:22] future be enough
[29:23] to chase away the clouds of our past
[29:26] like we live in fear that our past is
[29:28] going to catch up to us but we ought to
[29:30] just live with anticipation
[29:31] that our future is going to overwhelm us
[29:34] i'm not going to let my past catch up to
[29:36] me i'm catching up to my future
[29:38] why because my future in christ is a
[29:40] memory and i know it i can feel it i can
[29:43] see it i know it's real i'm coming to it
[29:46] and i don't have to worry about my past
[29:47] because it's going to be swallowed up in
[29:49] my future
[29:51] so our joy then is connected with the
[29:53] eternal not the temporal
[29:56] and let me ask you this what's greater
[30:00] what's greater 40 something years of
[30:02] human existence
[30:04] or a life that never ends what ought to
[30:07] have more power
[30:08] decades of unbelief decades of sin
[30:10] broken relationships bad mistakes
[30:13] addictions
[30:13] hostility bitterness estrangement
[30:16] decades of that
[30:17] or eternal life what's greater
[30:21] has more power and so the key scripture
[30:24] that brother of adam uses and things
[30:26] that are to be is john chapter 14
[30:28] verses one to three let not your heart
[30:30] be troubled
[30:31] you believe in god believe also and me
[30:34] and that's the first part
[30:35] of proving our love to him by believing
[30:37] what he said now
[30:38] he's talking about troubled hearts let
[30:39] not your heart be troubled it means
[30:40] inward commotion
[30:42] to lose the calmness of mind to make
[30:44] someone restless
[30:45] to to be troubled the word means to
[30:47] strike with fear or dread
[30:48] so he says don't lose your rest don't be
[30:52] troubled in mind
[30:53] don't be caused to lose don't be cause
[30:56] to have some sort of inward commotion
[30:59] be settled be at rest believe in me
[31:03] and then this is what he uses as the
[31:04] basis for this confidence
[31:06] or an untroubled heart in my father's
[31:08] house are many mansions we know these
[31:10] are not
[31:11] actually uh
[31:14] buildings but in my father's palace in
[31:16] my father's house are many bodies
[31:18] if it were not so i would have told you
[31:21] i go to prepare a place for you
[31:23] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[31:26] i will come again what is he wanting to
[31:28] set
[31:28] expectations and receive you unto myself
[31:31] that where i
[31:32] am there you may be also
[31:35] and it hit me a little bit differently
[31:37] over the last couple weeks in that
[31:39] if that's his future promise
[31:42] then as he is so are we in this world
[31:47] that there's something about this
[31:49] promise that is so
[31:50] certain and so sure that my heart ought
[31:53] not to be troubled
[31:55] just like the young girl on the ranch
[31:56] who has made the promise by the swift
[31:58] armor heir
[31:58] that i'm going to come back in a year am
[32:00] i going to marry you and so she could
[32:01] conduct herself in the midst of all the
[32:03] ridicule and sarcasm and bitterness of
[32:05] all the other girls and all the other
[32:06] cousins
[32:07] and all the other wealthy people there
[32:08] on the ranch wow because she was so
[32:10] certain that one day
[32:12] this man who had promised to take her
[32:13] away in marriage was going to come
[32:16] and so she could just the whole time say
[32:17] they have no idea
[32:20] oh karma's something else isn't it
[32:22] [Music]
[32:23] what what the look on their face and so
[32:25] oh is that really how you feel about me
[32:27] it's kind of like the whole thing when
[32:28] someone asks to speak to the manager and
[32:30] you're the manager
[32:32] say on go ahead what's your problem
[32:35] i want to talk to the owner
[32:38] i am the owner right
[32:41] it's like you can just you don't need to
[32:43] get fearful you don't need to be worried
[32:44] this is exactly how jesus is using these
[32:46] things to say look
[32:47] don't let your heart be anxious
[32:50] and it speaks to an anxiety it talks
[32:52] about this losing calmness of mine to
[32:54] make restless it's a feeling of worry or
[32:55] nervousness or unease
[32:58] and when anxiety uh becomes
[33:01] uh overwhelming and oftentimes anxieties
[33:04] relates to the imminence of an event or
[33:06] something
[33:06] about an uncertain outcome so you think
[33:09] something's gonna happen so you're
[33:10] anxious about this imminent outcome or
[33:12] you're you're uncertain about things how
[33:14] they're gonna work out it causes an
[33:15] anxiety and when it becomes excessive
[33:17] and you have this excessive
[33:18] apprehension it leads to compulsive
[33:20] behavior or even panic attacks amen all
[33:24] based upon what your perception of
[33:26] things
[33:26] and what you think the future is going
[33:28] to do or what the consequences are going
[33:29] to be
[33:30] and you have shortness of breath and
[33:31] accelerated a heartbeat and you things
[33:33] begin to
[33:33] your physical body begins to break down
[33:35] all because you're apprehensive
[33:37] and he's saying don't let that happen
[33:40] don't be anxious don't be fearful don't
[33:42] be worried
[33:42] don't be excessively apprehensive about
[33:45] things and he points to what will be
[33:47] as the source of our confidence and the
[33:50] way to allay a troubled heart
[33:53] how can we ease our fears well he goes
[33:54] ahead and he just points to something
[33:56] beyond
[33:57] whatever the outcome could be here
[33:59] notice he doesn't say hey don't let your
[34:01] heart be troubled
[34:02] none of you are going to be persecuted
[34:05] that would have been misleading hey
[34:07] don't worry from here it's a cakewalk
[34:09] and so oh awesome cakewalk
[34:13] and then things start going bad it's
[34:15] like i guess i didn't understand what
[34:16] cakewalk meant
[34:18] right and you just keep telling me this
[34:20] is really a cate walk no what you do is
[34:21] go this is no cake walk this is not a
[34:23] picnic this is war
[34:24] and so what god doesn't say he doesn't
[34:27] kind of try to oh let's just hide it
[34:28] from him he says nope you're going to be
[34:29] persecuted you can be hated you can be
[34:30] hunted down you're going to be killed
[34:33] and even to this hour we see in the word
[34:36] of god how the true bride is going to be
[34:37] hated of her brother and she's going to
[34:39] be persecuted and made fun of
[34:40] and laughed at and there's a press that
[34:43] comes against her for what she stands
[34:44] for even within the context of the
[34:46] message the confines of the message
[34:48] and so it doesn't hide the ball and say
[34:49] we're all gonna be one big happy family
[34:51] and everything's gonna be great and
[34:52] everything's gonna be wonderful he's
[34:53] just saying hey listen when it's all
[34:54] over this is what waits
[34:55] for you and not being dismissive of your
[34:59] pain
[35:00] but there's a there's a secret
[35:02] revelation there's a hidden revelation
[35:04] or let me say this
[35:04] there's a power in the revelation of
[35:07] that that can change
[35:08] how we relate to rejection and
[35:10] persecution now
[35:12] and that's why he points to the ultimate
[35:13] victory in my father's house are many
[35:15] mansions
[35:17] if it were not so i would have told you
[35:18] but i will come again i'll receive you
[35:20] that where i am there you may be also
[35:22] christ's remedy for a distressed heart
[35:24] and for someone who's going through
[35:25] something difficult was to speak to them
[35:27] about a greater reality before them
[35:30] i can't change reality that the way
[35:32] things are the circumstances
[35:34] the situation the disappointments the
[35:36] heartaches the hard trials
[35:37] all the sufferings and those things i
[35:39] can't change that but
[35:41] i want you to see something another
[35:43] reality that exists
[35:46] and that can change the way you conduct
[35:47] yourself
[35:49] brother branham says it this way and
[35:51] things that ought to be pointing to this
[35:52] very scripture he was telling them
[35:54] that after death there is life because i
[35:56] go and prepare a place
[35:58] that is to receive them shows that there
[36:01] he was speaking to them that there was a
[36:03] life after this life is ended
[36:07] and he says and what a consolation that
[36:09] ought to give all of us
[36:11] to know that after this life is over
[36:14] there's a life that we go into
[36:17] now let's think very let's just slow
[36:19] down and think about this
[36:22] how that the consolation
[36:25] is now it's not a consolation prize
[36:29] later
[36:31] in other words oh after this life is
[36:33] over that'll be a great consolation
[36:36] no i mean it just doesn't even fly with
[36:38] our we have a consolation
[36:40] prize or something like that it's for
[36:41] the guy who doesn't win like here's your
[36:43] participation trophy
[36:45] and that's that's not the way that this
[36:47] is the language is being used it means
[36:49] that ought to comfort us now
[36:52] that ought to perk us up now
[36:56] that ought to energize us now if that's
[36:58] what's coming
[36:59] then it ought to change the way things
[37:00] are now so he's not saying oh
[37:02] one day it'll feel good no he's saying
[37:04] right now it should
[37:06] because notice these i need to go a
[37:07] little bit more quickly now second
[37:08] corinthians chapter five verse one for
[37:10] we know that if our earthly house of
[37:12] this tabernacle were dissolved
[37:14] we have a building of god a house not
[37:16] made with hands eternal in the heavens
[37:18] that exists right now
[37:22] there is a body in an eternal realm that
[37:26] exists
[37:26] now so before you were ever born there
[37:28] was a representation of you
[37:30] in the eternals so it's not something
[37:32] that's going to come in existence later
[37:34] that in your most horrible state now
[37:36] even when you were lost and sinning and
[37:38] rejecting and worldly
[37:40] and ungodly even now through all your
[37:42] addictions and your
[37:43] uh battles and your frustrations there
[37:46] is a you
[37:47] that is existing now in god
[37:51] greater than this one greater than this
[37:53] reality
[37:54] in matthew chapter 18 verse 10 as he's
[37:56] talking about these little children
[37:58] and he says don't despise him he says
[38:02] that in heaven their angels do always
[38:05] behold the face of my father
[38:07] which is in heaven now and i know that
[38:10] i'm just making reference to this and
[38:12] not expounding upon
[38:13] the the conversation that's being had in
[38:15] matthew 18
[38:16] but when he makes this statement their
[38:18] angels
[38:19] he is acknowledging and pointing out
[38:22] that we all have one
[38:24] so we can say your angel beholds the
[38:28] face of the father which is in heaven
[38:30] it's a celestial reality it is what we
[38:33] call
[38:34] using language of the message it's a
[38:36] theophany
[38:38] which is a manifestation of god the
[38:40] theophant it's a manifestation of god
[38:43] which you are connected to and just to
[38:45] make
[38:46] summary of it it's a body that you will
[38:48] enter into and receive
[38:50] after this body is dissolved or changed
[38:53] right do we believe that and that exists
[38:56] now
[38:58] it's eternal now and
[39:02] jesus is pointed out in john 14. paul
[39:05] has pointed out in second corinthians 5
[39:07] jesus is making reference to it again in
[39:09] matthew 18. and we need to become more
[39:11] and more convinced of that reality
[39:14] and our position and our existence in it
[39:18] this is this is the victory ahead is
[39:21] victory now
[39:23] this is the real hope that we can have
[39:25] paul says in first corinthians 15 19 if
[39:27] in this life
[39:28] only we have hope in christ we are of
[39:31] all men most
[39:32] miserable the lack of a future hope
[39:36] imposes upon us a present misery as
[39:39] christians
[39:40] and this is the language he says if we
[39:42] in in this life
[39:43] only have the hope of christ so those
[39:45] who are hoping in christ
[39:47] only have in this life then we of
[39:49] everybody on the face of the earth would
[39:50] be the most
[39:51] miserable so then if
[39:54] only having hope in christ in this life
[39:56] makes you the most miserable person on
[39:58] earth
[39:58] then what about the assurance of a life
[40:00] after this one
[40:02] what about an assurance of a hope after
[40:03] this life what about the assurance of a
[40:05] bright future
[40:06] it ought to make you the most ambitious
[40:08] person on earth
[40:09] that ought to make you the happiest
[40:10] creature on earth regardless of what you
[40:12] go through regardless of your
[40:13] circumstances
[40:14] if with no hope in christ after this
[40:16] life makes you the most miserable
[40:18] then a revelation of my hope in christ
[40:20] after this life
[40:21] makes me the mostest happiest
[40:25] what is this hope colossians 1 5 for the
[40:27] hope which is laid up for you in heaven
[40:29] where have you heard before in the word
[40:31] of truth of the gospel
[40:33] paul is saying your confidence is born
[40:35] from experiencing what heaven holds for
[40:38] you
[40:40] he says for the hope which is laid up
[40:42] for you in heaven
[40:43] which you heard before in the word of
[40:45] truth of the gospel
[40:46] your confident hope your expectation
[40:50] your feelings now and how you feel and
[40:52] your joy and your anticipation
[40:54] and the con the the content of your
[40:57] character
[40:58] and the nature of your your conduct is
[41:01] born from experiencing
[41:02] what heaven holds for you the things we
[41:06] experience in the supernatural
[41:08] is a foretaste of what's coming the
[41:10] baptism of the holy ghost which is the
[41:12] seal of god the new birth
[41:13] is a down payment and an evidence of the
[41:17] inheritance that you're going to receive
[41:20] it is a guarantee it is the earnest it
[41:22] is the earnest the full redemption
[41:24] so you have the opportunity to begin to
[41:27] taste the eternal
[41:28] and in taste and experiencing the
[41:29] eternal it gives us a confident
[41:33] listen hope says when you heard before
[41:35] the word of truth
[41:36] we ought to be so certain of this the
[41:38] word of truth is never merely data
[41:40] the word of truth is never merely
[41:42] information the word of truth is never
[41:44] just historical
[41:46] if it's referring to information if it
[41:48] refers to data if it refers to history
[41:50] and you're only catching it that way say
[41:52] god show me the more
[41:54] because it's never merely that it's
[41:56] inspirational
[41:57] it's instructive it's it's motivating
[42:02] it is living and eternal it is your joy
[42:07] victory ahead is victory now that means
[42:11] we're anchoring in something beyond the
[42:12] temporal
[42:15] something beyond the temporal is what
[42:17] i'm anchored to i'm tethered to
[42:20] matthew chapter 5 verses 11 and 12 this
[42:22] is just an example of how
[42:24] again the future is impacting the
[42:26] present
[42:27] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[42:29] and persecute you
[42:30] and say all manner of evil against you
[42:32] falsely for my sake
[42:34] right you're blessed so really
[42:37] any if anybody ever asks us blessed
[42:41] blessed especially lately or something
[42:43] you can always if you're really going
[42:44] through it you can say even more so
[42:45] lately
[42:46] blessed are you when people revile you
[42:47] persecute you disrespect you mistreat
[42:49] you use you
[42:50] say all manner of evil against you
[42:52] falsely for my sake and then he just
[42:53] doesn't stop there
[42:54] rejoice and be exceeding gladden
[42:58] he's actually saying leap for joy this
[43:00] is the believer's exercise regime
[43:03] and as the bride walks in this truth she
[43:05] can be more and more healthy and shed
[43:06] even more calories
[43:07] because she is going to constantly be
[43:09] leaping for joy
[43:10] with everything that's happening around
[43:12] her and to her
[43:14] rejoice and be exceeding glad the
[43:15] rejoicing it means it's so
[43:17] deep it actually motivates you
[43:20] physically to exuberance
[43:24] uh because of the persecution
[43:27] well for great is your reward in heaven
[43:33] and he says for so persecuted they the
[43:35] prophets which were before you there's
[43:36] two layers to you to it
[43:38] if you're suffering now realize that
[43:39] you're suffering in the same manner that
[43:41] the prophets have
[43:42] and that christ has he says remember
[43:44] they're going to hate you
[43:45] but remember they hated me before they
[43:46] hated you and that kind of gives us some
[43:49] assurance and
[43:50] and a way to rationalize with it and
[43:52] process and say well it hurts really
[43:53] really
[43:54] bad but jesus knows what it's like and
[43:56] they hate me but they also hated him
[43:58] and it kind of helps us with these
[43:59] discomforting emotions but he just
[44:01] doesn't leave it in the past
[44:02] he projects into the future and he says
[44:04] you're rejoicing
[44:06] your exuberance your leaping your joy
[44:09] is also connected to the reward that's
[44:11] awaiting you in heaven
[44:12] so regardless of what's passed
[44:14] regardless of what's present
[44:15] there's something in the future that
[44:17] radiates back upon me now
[44:19] and i can live in the brightness of a
[44:21] future glory today
[44:26] rejoice and be a seed and gladden that's
[44:28] exactly
[44:29] because great is your reward in light of
[44:31] the hatred persecution
[44:33] reviling evil speaking lies
[44:37] but because of a great reward ahead in
[44:39] heaven it changes the way i live right
[44:40] now
[44:42] so looking under jesus causes us to be
[44:44] forward looking
[44:47] considering him we actually look back to
[44:49] him as an example
[44:50] so we can look back considering him
[44:54] and then as we look to looking back to
[44:56] him considering his example
[44:58] we realized that he was forward-looking
[45:00] so in considering him and looking at
[45:02] it's not that we're just always looking
[45:04] back but we're looking at these
[45:05] different aspects in christ
[45:06] and we can be forward looking
[45:10] in john chapter 8 verse 56 notice it
[45:12] happened with abraham your father
[45:13] abraham rejoiced to see my day
[45:15] and he saw it
[45:18] it says he rejoiced to see it means he
[45:21] gushed with excited desire
[45:24] abraham gushed with the excited desire
[45:26] to see christ's day
[45:28] and he saw it and was glad
[45:32] so you notice how this works you get
[45:35] excited about it and then he shows it to
[45:36] you
[45:38] and then once he shows it to you it's
[45:40] not a future joy it's a present joy
[45:43] abraham rejoiced to see christ's day god
[45:46] showed it to him
[45:47] and he saw it and was glad he saw it by
[45:50] revelation
[45:51] and was joyful he saw it prefigured he
[45:53] saw it
[45:54] in type and when abraham was so excited
[45:56] to see it god showed it to him so his
[45:58] excitement brought him to an experience
[46:00] to
[46:00] of a revelation of it and the revelation
[46:02] of it brought him joy
[46:04] then it wasn't yeah well one day
[46:08] one day when it's all over yeah
[46:11] but oh immediately it's like hey whoa
[46:14] yes
[46:15] yes i was under anticipation i was
[46:17] expecting it i was
[46:18] hopeful i was the rash with this
[46:20] expectation and i was longing to sit and
[46:22] then god shows it and the revelation
[46:24] brings the joy
[46:27] in first peter chapter 1 verses 19 to 21
[46:31] because considering him looking to him
[46:33] looking at his example notice how the
[46:34] scripture speaks
[46:36] of christ and how we ought to interact
[46:38] with the revelation of it
[46:40] but we have been purchased by but with
[46:42] the precious blood of christ
[46:44] as a lamb without blemish and without
[46:46] spot
[46:48] who verily was foreordained before the
[46:51] foundation of the world
[46:52] so the lamb was for ordained the
[46:56] lamb as a sacrifice the shedding of the
[46:57] blood of christ his shedding of the
[46:59] blood his
[47:00] his role and perpetuation as a sacrifice
[47:02] was for ordained notice
[47:03] before time but was manifest in these
[47:07] last times for you
[47:08] so it's maybe a paradox for ordained
[47:10] before time but the actual crucifying
[47:12] and sacrifice
[47:13] just took place before your eyes who by
[47:15] him
[47:16] do believe who by him do believe in god
[47:19] and so we believe
[47:20] by christ in god that raised him up from
[47:23] the dead and gave him glory christ
[47:25] raised up his son from the dead gave him
[47:28] glory
[47:29] that your faith and hope might be
[47:32] in god so really to me all these
[47:35] elements in this are so important
[47:37] that christ shed his blood for our sins
[47:40] and that we by believing we believe that
[47:43] god raised him from the dead and god
[47:45] gave him glory
[47:46] and that by our faith these things
[47:48] happen so that our faith is not only in
[47:50] god
[47:50] but our hope is in god so we have this
[47:53] we have faith in god but now we have
[47:55] this
[47:55] expectation joyful expectation
[47:57] anticipation
[47:59] positive expectation not the enemy of
[48:01] faith but a hope
[48:02] in god that is rooted in a truth that is
[48:04] birthed from faith that you might have
[48:06] faith
[48:07] in god and hope in god based upon the
[48:10] fact that god ordained him before the
[48:12] foundation of the world
[48:13] that it happened and now he's seated
[48:15] he's given him glory
[48:16] raised him from the dead and gave him
[48:17] glory now in romans chapter 8
[48:20] verse 28 all things work together for
[48:22] the good right to then
[48:24] love god and are called according to his
[48:26] purpose
[48:28] and this is this is connected with how
[48:30] do i conduct myself with joy
[48:32] by believing or how do i prove my loved
[48:35] one believe what he said
[48:36] conduct myself with joy and as it
[48:38] continues
[48:40] all that were foreknown are
[48:41] predestinated
[48:43] right so if you're for known uh
[48:46] you're predestined if you're elect
[48:48] you're predestinated and then you're
[48:49] brought to glory if you
[48:50] read those verses even to verse 30 it
[48:52] might be if you read in there
[48:54] it's showing foreknowledge
[48:55] predestination ultimate destination
[48:58] ultimate glory it's all connected
[48:59] together and it can't break
[49:03] there's a there is a truth to
[49:06] confess justification confession of
[49:09] sanctification
[49:10] but we can take it and kind of misalign
[49:12] it to think that you can actually be
[49:14] justified and then be lost
[49:17] now think about it i i'm not going to
[49:19] have to
[49:21] sit down and explain it to you right and
[49:23] yeah i mean because
[49:24] we'll just chew on it for a little bit
[49:25] lord will bring us maybe to another a
[49:27] greater
[49:27] teaching on it or more teaching on it if
[49:30] you are justified
[49:32] the bible says you he you're justified
[49:36] he that he has justified he is glorified
[49:40] right so if you've been justified you're
[49:42] already glorified
[49:43] if there's not a glorified
[49:44] representation you cannot truly be
[49:46] justified
[49:47] now you can be under the confession of
[49:49] justification you can have the
[49:51] confession of faith you can potentially
[49:52] be
[49:53] confessing that you believe and
[49:55] potentially seem to be under
[49:56] as judas was a justification but if you
[49:59] are truly justified you're already
[50:01] glorified because that's scripture
[50:03] then if you are sanctified the bible
[50:04] says he have perfected forever
[50:06] them that are sanctified so the believer
[50:08] having been sanctified
[50:09] is already perfected i say it to say
[50:12] this that as the elect
[50:13] you are on a different path than those
[50:16] who can appear to be justified
[50:17] and appear to be sanctified and still
[50:20] reject truth and be lost
[50:22] that cannot happen to the elect of god
[50:25] it is impossible
[50:30] and so for knowledge election and
[50:32] predestination all work together not
[50:34] independently
[50:36] you can't be elect and then not be
[50:37] predestinated so foreign knowledge
[50:39] election and predestination all working
[50:41] together
[50:42] in christ as we see in christ ordained
[50:44] before the foundational world
[50:45] and in you jesus said in john 17 24
[50:48] father i will that they also
[50:50] whom thou has given me be with me where
[50:52] i am that they may behold my glory
[50:55] so that he's praying for you that you
[50:57] may be with him where he is
[50:59] so you see this continuity that as he is
[51:01] in this world so are we
[51:02] that where i am there you may be also
[51:04] this is his prayer and he says
[51:06] that they may behold my glory we need to
[51:08] get the glory which thou hast
[51:10] given me for thou lovest me before
[51:13] the foundation of the world so christ
[51:16] was
[51:17] ordained before the foundation of the
[51:18] world and he is going to be given glory
[51:21] because the god loved him before the
[51:23] foundation of the world that's christ
[51:26] notice how paul says in ephesians 1 4.
[51:29] i i know i'm going very quickly over
[51:31] this because i only want just to point
[51:33] out
[51:33] the forward-looking aspect and these
[51:35] points in eternity
[51:37] where things are being said about you
[51:40] about christ and you i want you just to
[51:42] kind of look at look at the big this big
[51:44] picture so there's a lot more
[51:46] time that should be spent on these but i
[51:47] just wanted to point to them very
[51:49] quickly according he had
[51:50] chosen us in him so
[51:54] god loved the son before the foundation
[51:56] of the world and we were chosen
[51:58] in christ before the foundational world
[51:59] so we were chosen in love in love having
[52:01] predestinated us
[52:03] that we should be holy and without blame
[52:05] before him in love
[52:07] having predestinated which was the next
[52:08] one so we have been that we have been
[52:10] called then
[52:11] chosen us in christ before the
[52:12] foundational world with the destiny
[52:14] that we might be holding without blame
[52:16] because in love we have been
[52:18] predestinated
[52:20] are we not taught in ephesians that we
[52:22] are right now presently seated in
[52:23] heavenly places in christ jesus
[52:28] doesn't look heavenly looks like a
[52:31] courtyard by marriott to me
[52:33] looks like the generic convention hall
[52:35] carpet
[52:37] i look around but i'm seated right now
[52:39] in heavenly places
[52:41] already raised up already passed from
[52:43] death and to life
[52:44] that's a reality and i
[52:47] if i could just say this really the uh
[52:50] what we
[52:50] ought to be striving for every day is a
[52:53] greater
[52:54] understanding of that reality let me
[52:56] live in that reality let me be subject
[52:58] to that reality let me submit myself to
[53:00] that reality lord it's real it's real
[53:01] it's real it's real i believe it
[53:02] that's the that's the energy for the
[53:04] fruits of the spirit
[53:08] so in eternity before there was ever
[53:10] time god chose you
[53:14] in eternity before there was time god
[53:16] loved the son
[53:18] chose you in him before there was time
[53:21] he slewed the lamb and then destined you
[53:25] to be perfect forever
[53:27] or destined you to a perfect forever
[53:29] however you want to look at it
[53:31] so god does this the term that's used
[53:35] is foreknowledge elect according to
[53:38] the foreknowledge of god the bible says
[53:41] that's god's awareness of a thing before
[53:43] it happens or before it's manifested
[53:45] as peter said who verily was ordained
[53:47] before the foundation of the world
[53:49] that's for knowledge but was manifest in
[53:51] these last times god foreknew
[53:53] purpose formed the intent i hope this
[53:56] isn't getting
[53:57] i'm going to be getting too technical
[53:59] here i was explaining
[54:01] um i was trying to explain to sister
[54:04] elizabeth this morning
[54:05] quantum mechanics quantum superposition
[54:08] and schrodinger's cat i wouldn't even
[54:11] get into schrodinger's equation
[54:12] and she said honey you're not going to
[54:14] talk about that this morning in service
[54:15] are you
[54:16] and no no not this morning but if i get
[54:19] past noon
[54:21] i was like no i'm not going to do it um
[54:25] but there's an interesting some
[54:26] interesting things to talk about if you
[54:28] what are you what are you guys doing for
[54:29] lunch i want to hijack the open house
[54:33] but we can maybe talk about
[54:34] quantum superposition between three and
[54:36] five today
[54:41] but now there's a moment where how do i
[54:43] get into that
[54:44] oh yo i'm not i'm not going to be too
[54:45] technical but god
[54:47] there's a time when it's thought of in
[54:48] eternity it's in eternity and it
[54:50] manifest in time but it was eternal
[54:52] before it manifests here and so foreign
[54:54] knowledge of god is this awareness that
[54:56] something's going to happen it's a
[54:57] knowledge of something before it exists
[55:00] and so god's foreign knowledge about the
[55:01] future this is the part
[55:03] the part i had to skip over last time i
[55:04] left out last time god's foreknowledge
[55:06] about the future
[55:08] dictated a provision in eternity
[55:13] why did he slay the lamb
[55:17] it had to be slain as a sacrifice why
[55:19] did you need sacrifice
[55:21] for someone's sins
[55:24] so this is god in being proactive this
[55:27] is god in eternity
[55:28] god in his mind and i realize there's a
[55:29] paradox to it and there's a way that
[55:31] it's very difficult maybe to resolve
[55:32] these things
[55:33] but god's foreknowledge about your
[55:35] future condition
[55:36] and god's foreknowledge about what will
[55:38] be dictated that he had to
[55:40] in eternity form the attempt and
[55:43] actually slay the lamb
[55:45] before the foundation of the world
[55:49] so in terms of time things that would be
[55:53] necessitated that god act or purpose
[55:56] before time begin
[55:58] so in revelations chapter 13 verse 8 and
[56:00] all that dwell upon the earth shall
[56:02] worship him
[56:03] and this is not a good worship that
[56:04] we're to worship this antichrist
[56:06] whose names are not written in the book
[56:08] of life of the lamb
[56:10] slain before the foundation of the world
[56:15] now peter has said that the lamb was for
[56:18] ordained before the foundation of the
[56:19] world
[56:19] so the sacrifice was for ordained god
[56:22] formed the intent before the foundation
[56:23] of the world now the language that's
[56:24] used here in revelation
[56:27] calls him a lamb slain before the
[56:29] foundation of the world
[56:30] why based on what would later be in time
[56:34] why was he slain he wouldn't have been
[56:35] slain if there wouldn't have been a need
[56:36] for the slain
[56:37] in time so we realized now in the
[56:40] eternities god's purposing something
[56:42] beforehand
[56:43] before you even come he's already made a
[56:46] decision beforehand
[56:49] and so it's the lamb slain before the
[56:50] foundation of the world romans 5 2
[56:52] by this lamb by whom also we have access
[56:55] by faith into this grace wherein we
[56:57] stand
[56:58] and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[57:01] so christ becomes the source of our hope
[57:04] we rejoice in the hope of the glory of
[57:06] god we rejoice
[57:07] now we're joyful we're happy now in the
[57:09] glory of god because through this
[57:10] sacrifice
[57:11] we have access by faith into this grace
[57:13] wherein we stand it's your standing in
[57:15] christ
[57:16] not your present circumstances
[57:19] all because of this lamb that's slain
[57:20] before the foundation of the world
[57:22] but then there's a way that it's written
[57:24] whose names are not written in the book
[57:25] of life of the lamb slain before the
[57:27] foundation of the world
[57:29] so then there's names that are written
[57:30] in the lamb's book of life
[57:33] based upon the foreknowledge of god
[57:35] according to the future
[57:37] so no matter how you look at it whether
[57:39] it's the names or the lamb
[57:41] god by foreknowledge has written your
[57:43] name down in a record that can't be
[57:44] blotted out
[57:45] and has caused the sacrifice that would
[57:48] cover those names
[57:49] so they couldn't be blotted out so it's
[57:51] permanent and that's already settled and
[57:53] decided before there's one
[57:55] creation so that when things happen now
[57:59] in in earth just as jesus said i'm
[58:02] telling you these things beforehand
[58:03] so that in me you might have peace so
[58:05] that when they take place
[58:06] you'll take great comfort and no one
[58:07] already warned you ahead of time so we
[58:09] could take the same thing and realize
[58:11] god is making these provisions and doing
[58:12] these things
[58:13] well before time and now here i am in
[58:16] time and i'm considering him and i'm
[58:18] looking to jesus and i'm realizing
[58:20] there's something eternal that's higher
[58:23] that's greater that's more real than
[58:25] anything that happens
[58:27] in bc or a.d
[58:31] and listen to what jesus says in luke 10
[58:32] 20 as they all came back from a revival
[58:34] from a camp meeting
[58:35] and everything was really excitable and
[58:37] everything was everybody was really
[58:38] really happy because demons were cast
[58:40] out he says
[58:41] notwithstanding in this rejoice not
[58:44] that the spirits are subject unto you in
[58:46] other words what's your real joy what's
[58:48] your real rejoicing
[58:49] what are you anchored in but rather
[58:51] rejoice because your names are written
[58:52] in heaven
[58:55] the source of your joy is not whether or
[58:57] not you lay hands on the sick and they
[58:58] recover
[58:59] the source of your joy is not whether or
[59:00] not you get the experience the dead
[59:02] being raised the source of your joy is
[59:04] not in casting out devils and working
[59:05] many modern
[59:06] mighty wonderful works the source of
[59:08] your joy and your rejoicing
[59:09] is in that your name is written in
[59:11] heaven the source of your joy is in his
[59:14] election and his predestination
[59:17] brother of adam uses the phrase it's
[59:18] scoff it's in your scofield bibles where
[59:20] he takes it
[59:21] election looks back to foreign knowledge
[59:24] predestination forward to the destiny
[59:27] and they're tied together election looks
[59:29] back to foreign so
[59:30] our current state of being elect is the
[59:33] outcome of god
[59:35] electing a pr of god's foreknowledge
[59:38] and then he by the same foreign
[59:39] knowledge he's now and this is the
[59:41] practical outworking of the foreign
[59:42] knowledge
[59:42] not just election but then election
[59:44] works to reaching
[59:46] our ultimate destiny brother ram says an
[59:49] adoption
[59:49] i'm gonna i'm gonna uh turn it up to one
[59:52] point one and a half speed now
[59:54] he says god before the foundation of the
[59:56] world elected that the cocklebur is to
[59:59] become a grain of wheat that's you
[1:00:01] by election now i know i'm a grain of
[1:00:03] wheat because i'm saved how do i do it
[1:00:05] look back and see what he predestined
[1:00:07] long time ago
[1:00:09] by foreknowledge he seemed that i would
[1:00:11] love him so he made a perpetuation
[1:00:13] through his own son
[1:00:14] that through him i might become from a
[1:00:17] cocklebur to a grain of wheat now don't
[1:00:19] take that statement to mean
[1:00:20] that somehow you forced god's hands his
[1:00:23] election is
[1:00:24] independent you didn't make yourself
[1:00:28] saved you didn't make god save you it's
[1:00:30] his choice
[1:00:32] brother donnie reagan shared it with me
[1:00:33] one time fellowshipping on this subject
[1:00:35] and just to me it was like the final
[1:00:36] nail
[1:00:37] in in the in the in the coffin of your
[1:00:39] works having anything to do with your
[1:00:41] election
[1:00:41] he said adam was placed on the basis of
[1:00:43] free moral agency but he had no choice
[1:00:45] to be a son
[1:00:48] you are his son by his choice you're his
[1:00:51] daughter
[1:00:52] by his choice by foreknowledge he saw
[1:00:54] that you you would love him so he made a
[1:00:56] way for you
[1:00:57] so that through him i might become from
[1:00:59] a cocklebury to a grain of weed
[1:01:01] now where am i at now i'm saved i'm
[1:01:03] walking in the grace of god
[1:01:04] what does predestination look to destiny
[1:01:07] where will he take me to where am i
[1:01:09] going
[1:01:09] that's got you there you are
[1:01:12] so it's that it's what has been his
[1:01:15] election i'm anchored and tied to
[1:01:17] my foundation his is his election but my
[1:01:19] destiny is his predestination his
[1:01:21] calling in my future
[1:01:23] and this is what determines how i ought
[1:01:25] to conduct myself
[1:01:26] is what is coming because he's changed
[1:01:29] my nature
[1:01:31] now luke chapter 11 verses 11 to 13.
[1:01:36] he says if a natural son would ask his
[1:01:38] father for bread will he get a stone if
[1:01:39] he asks for a fish will give him a snake
[1:01:41] if he asks for a
[1:01:42] leg excuse me not a leg but an egg would
[1:01:44] he offer him a scorpion
[1:01:46] might feel like an arm and a leg when he
[1:01:48] asked for 20 bucks but
[1:01:51] if he shall ask for an egg he offers him
[1:01:52] a scorpion and basically he's saying no
[1:01:54] if you ask your dad for bread he'll give
[1:01:56] you bread if you ask for a fish he'll
[1:01:58] give you fish if you ask for an egg
[1:01:59] he'll give you
[1:02:00] an egg he says and then if you being
[1:02:02] evil or even formed from
[1:02:04] evil in the products of a sinful birth
[1:02:06] know how to give good gifts unto your
[1:02:07] children
[1:02:09] how much more shall your heavenly father
[1:02:11] give the holy spirit to them that ask
[1:02:12] him
[1:02:16] i want to quickly just focus you on this
[1:02:20] he's dealing with expectation and hopes
[1:02:22] about the future
[1:02:23] based upon relationship he's saying a
[1:02:26] son
[1:02:27] should not expect a scorpion from his
[1:02:30] dad if he asked him for an egg
[1:02:33] saying that a son should not expect a
[1:02:35] stone from his dad if he asked his dad
[1:02:37] for bread right so he's talking about
[1:02:40] what
[1:02:40] what state of apprehension or
[1:02:43] anticipation
[1:02:44] should a child be in when you ask a
[1:02:46] parent for something good
[1:02:48] he said if a natural parent knows how to
[1:02:50] give good things to his children that
[1:02:51] asks
[1:02:52] how much more shall your heavenly father
[1:02:54] so then how much more should we
[1:02:56] be in a state of anticipation rather
[1:02:59] apprehension
[1:03:01] since he's dealing about our concurrent
[1:03:03] condition of whether we
[1:03:05] be dreadful apprehension or excitable
[1:03:07] anticipation
[1:03:08] how much more are we to conduct
[1:03:10] ourselves with joy
[1:03:12] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[1:03:13] allows to come to pass based upon the
[1:03:15] fact
[1:03:16] that he loves us oh how he loves us
[1:03:20] and that's what i'm basing it on that he
[1:03:23] loves me
[1:03:24] and it's base and he's trying to use
[1:03:26] this analogy of an a of a
[1:03:28] father's love so in things that are to
[1:03:30] be
[1:03:31] he says look at how your earthly parent
[1:03:32] before you come here
[1:03:34] before they knowed you was coming made
[1:03:36] ready for your coming i hope that you
[1:03:37] could just catch
[1:03:39] this beautiful picture your parents made
[1:03:41] ready for your coming
[1:03:42] just think of that now your earthly
[1:03:44] parents
[1:03:46] so now god which an earthly parent is
[1:03:49] only a type of a heavenly parent so now
[1:03:51] look at our relationship to god and what
[1:03:53] our expectations ought to be and what is
[1:03:55] he doing and what is he forming and what
[1:03:56] is he
[1:03:57] taking care of if we know how to give
[1:03:59] good gifts to our children how much more
[1:04:00] does your heavenly father
[1:04:02] know how to give good gifts to his
[1:04:03] children jesus spoke these words
[1:04:05] they made ready your coming
[1:04:08] so when your earthly parents when the
[1:04:10] mother was pregnant
[1:04:12] the father and mother made ready for the
[1:04:14] child that was coming now notice
[1:04:16] the child's not there yet but he says
[1:04:18] they made a little crib
[1:04:20] or got some little booties or little
[1:04:22] clothes or so forth
[1:04:24] they made ready everything for you to
[1:04:26] arrive
[1:04:27] prepared before you ever even come on
[1:04:30] the earth
[1:04:31] so even before you get there things are
[1:04:34] coming to the manifestation
[1:04:36] things are coming out why because the
[1:04:38] parent's preparation
[1:04:41] is based upon their expectation of what
[1:04:43] will be
[1:04:44] so they have baby showers they paint the
[1:04:46] nursery they they they buy diapers or
[1:04:48] don't buy diapers they they get car
[1:04:50] seats they
[1:04:50] they get clothes what they're all doing
[1:04:53] this in anticipation
[1:04:54] of the arrival
[1:04:58] but catch this none of that would be
[1:05:01] sane
[1:05:03] if they didn't know a baby was coming
[1:05:07] like none of that
[1:05:08] it wouldn't make sense and we're just
[1:05:09] thinking rationally according to human
[1:05:11] thought
[1:05:11] all that behavior all that activity all
[1:05:14] that effort all that energy
[1:05:15] all these things the painting the
[1:05:17] construction the crib the booties the
[1:05:19] diapers
[1:05:19] the baby showers all these things it's
[1:05:22] all done
[1:05:23] in light of what is coming
[1:05:26] they only exist then think about the
[1:05:28] things that exist
[1:05:30] they don't exist for the parents
[1:05:35] right they exist for the baby
[1:05:39] the crib isn't for the dad who's like
[1:05:40] i'm never going to catch up on sleep
[1:05:43] and crawl into the crib the diapers
[1:05:44] aren't for the the parents the the
[1:05:46] booties all those things
[1:05:47] these are for the babies and each one of
[1:05:49] those things that come into
[1:05:50] manifestation
[1:05:52] before the baby ever arrives is related
[1:05:54] directly to something the baby's gonna
[1:05:56] need for its reality
[1:06:00] it comes into existence because of the
[1:06:02] future
[1:06:03] it comes into existence now because the
[1:06:05] need is soon going to arrive
[1:06:08] whoa amen
[1:06:11] go ahead and think spiritual we're not
[1:06:13] talking about baby showers now
[1:06:15] we're talking about a heavenly father
[1:06:18] that knows there's something coming and
[1:06:21] will bring things into manifestation now
[1:06:24] and we'll give you things now as a
[1:06:26] heavenly father now
[1:06:28] knowing that you need it now in order to
[1:06:30] be who you will be there
[1:06:33] that's what a heavenly parent an earthly
[1:06:34] parent will do so that he continues on
[1:06:37] the subject this is what really brings
[1:06:38] it home in paragraph 67
[1:06:40] notice how the expecting mother on earth
[1:06:42] today how the mother's body craves for
[1:06:45] certain things i'm speaking i guess i
[1:06:46] hope to all adults that'll understand
[1:06:48] the mother and the birth of the baby if
[1:06:50] there's something lacking in her body
[1:06:51] she begins to crave certain things
[1:06:53] i remember we raised such a poor family
[1:06:55] we didn't have hardly anything to eat
[1:06:56] when we were kids
[1:06:57] many of you suffered the same thing so
[1:07:00] how that when the before the babies
[1:07:01] would be born
[1:07:03] mother would crave something now brother
[1:07:05] branham is using
[1:07:07] this understanding that a mother's
[1:07:09] craving is related to
[1:07:11] the need of a baby right he's using this
[1:07:14] understanding
[1:07:15] to make a greater point so we're not
[1:07:17] trying to make the scientific point that
[1:07:19] a mother wanting pickles and peanut
[1:07:20] butter
[1:07:21] uh is related to the baby needing
[1:07:23] something in the pickles and peanut
[1:07:24] butter
[1:07:24] this is something that relates to a
[1:07:26] mother's cravings and what she eats and
[1:07:28] what she ingests and how she's driven to
[1:07:30] do certain things
[1:07:31] is related to something else he says
[1:07:33] before the baby would be born mother
[1:07:34] would crave something
[1:07:35] and dad would just pinch corners and
[1:07:37] everything in his poverty
[1:07:38] to get it for it's her the body her body
[1:07:42] the calcium and so forth of her body the
[1:07:44] nutrients the vitamins that she needs so
[1:07:45] all these things he says
[1:07:47] juni is being made up and he craves for
[1:07:50] things
[1:07:51] foods for the coming child
[1:07:55] so the mother's craving but the cravings
[1:07:58] are what
[1:07:58] because there's a body being formed on
[1:08:01] the inside of the mother
[1:08:03] and how parents they try to get so the
[1:08:06] baby will be born as
[1:08:08] perfectly and happy as possible
[1:08:12] this is what natural parents do wouldn't
[1:08:14] your heavenly father
[1:08:16] be doing the same thing now think about
[1:08:19] it
[1:08:20] see how your parents will do that when
[1:08:22] there's something needed the mother
[1:08:23] gives witness of it
[1:08:25] her system is made up now the baby's not
[1:08:27] here yet but that baby needs something
[1:08:30] so her system's made up toward now while
[1:08:33] in incubation while in the womb
[1:08:35] she's going to pour in nutrients into
[1:08:37] that baby that it needs he says you
[1:08:39] understand
[1:08:40] that's how that when there's something
[1:08:41] needed here to the oncoming child
[1:08:44] the mother begins to crave for that
[1:08:47] the child's not here yet but it needs it
[1:08:51] now now so the expecting parents now
[1:08:55] just
[1:08:55] try to with a few moments that we have
[1:08:57] remaining in this morning
[1:08:59] just try to really let this break open
[1:09:01] into you and have a revelation of this
[1:09:03] what he's trying to make
[1:09:04] say the expecting parents are
[1:09:07] experiencing a transformation
[1:09:09] even before the baby arrives
[1:09:13] just as the father and mother went out
[1:09:15] and bought a crib why because the baby's
[1:09:16] going to be sleeping in that crib
[1:09:18] why did they paint the nursery blue
[1:09:20] because they think they're having a boy
[1:09:22] right why do they buy diapers because
[1:09:26] babies need diapers
[1:09:29] these things are being done because the
[1:09:31] baby needs it now he uses it in this way
[1:09:33] the mother's cravings during pregnancy
[1:09:35] are
[1:09:36] not for her solely for her benefit
[1:09:39] it's not just to get her through the
[1:09:40] trimester not just to get her through
[1:09:43] the day and to
[1:09:44] knock away some cravings but she's
[1:09:46] actually eating now
[1:09:48] based upon a need that the baby has and
[1:09:50] it's calling for
[1:09:52] and it's not just to make the baby's
[1:09:54] womb experience
[1:09:56] uh a peaceful or stop it from kicking or
[1:09:58] moving around
[1:09:59] but it's actually for the proper
[1:10:01] development of the baby so that it can
[1:10:02] come into a perfect delivery
[1:10:06] it's done based upon the child's future
[1:10:09] so the preparation in the womb is for
[1:10:12] the reality that awaits the newborn
[1:10:14] why do they why is there going to be
[1:10:16] these different things why is there
[1:10:17] booties because that baby is going to
[1:10:18] have feet
[1:10:20] why is there diapers because the baby's
[1:10:21] going to have a little bottom why do you
[1:10:23] have all these things because there's
[1:10:24] going to be a body
[1:10:26] that's going to need those things
[1:10:28] hallelujah there's going to be eyes
[1:10:29] there's going to be hands there's going
[1:10:30] to be feet there's going to be a body
[1:10:32] that lays in that crib there's going to
[1:10:33] be a body that wears that onesie there's
[1:10:35] going to be a body that wears those
[1:10:36] diapers there's going to be a body that
[1:10:38] eats that baby food and the mother's
[1:10:40] preparation in the womb is developing
[1:10:42] the baby for reality
[1:10:44] outside of it and the hope of the
[1:10:47] expecting father
[1:10:48] and the excitement of an expecting
[1:10:49] mother changes the course of their
[1:10:51] entire lives
[1:10:53] changes their conduct i i welcome the
[1:10:56] sisters to give a hearty amen if this is
[1:10:58] true
[1:10:59] i i i think maybe to a sister it's even
[1:11:01] more pronounced and would be a greater
[1:11:03] type to what i'm trying to
[1:11:04] describe but a mother loves her baby
[1:11:06] long before she sees it
[1:11:09] right right mothers can we all say man
[1:11:12] mothers
[1:11:13] amen you love that thing before you ever
[1:11:16] see it
[1:11:17] before it ever cries you have deep
[1:11:19] empathy for it before it ever takes a
[1:11:21] breath you do anything to protect it
[1:11:24] you love it before you ever even see it
[1:11:26] and it's unexplainable
[1:11:30] it's hard for you to explain it unless
[1:11:31] somebody else knows this feeling
[1:11:34] right mothers because you've never seen
[1:11:36] it but you feel it
[1:11:38] you know it's there you know it's real
[1:11:43] right and it's just pushing out
[1:11:46] and everyone else knows they're under
[1:11:48] expectation
[1:11:51] they're under anticipation it's a
[1:11:53] reality deep inside you
[1:11:55] that you can't deny and so you love it
[1:11:59] even before it cries or wails even
[1:12:01] before you hold it
[1:12:02] you love it and you promise that you'll
[1:12:04] keep it to never let any harm come to it
[1:12:07] this is what brother branham is pointing
[1:12:09] to
[1:12:10] to understand god and ourselves
[1:12:14] he said that god as a heavenly parent
[1:12:17] now notice
[1:12:17] how things come into manifestation now
[1:12:19] before the baby ever arrives
[1:12:21] and there's things that the baby's
[1:12:22] receiving while in the womb getting
[1:12:24] ready to be delivered
[1:12:25] so that it can have what it needs when
[1:12:26] it arrives
[1:12:28] you don't think god's pouring stuff into
[1:12:29] you now we're not waiting for it one day
[1:12:32] we're getting it now
[1:12:34] the translation transpires when you're
[1:12:36] finally fully made up and ready to be
[1:12:37] there
[1:12:38] we're not going to be broken imperfect
[1:12:39] people that in a moment in a twinkling
[1:12:41] of an eye are changed
[1:12:42] to become perfectly whole and joyful no
[1:12:44] right now the fruits of the spirit are
[1:12:46] mending
[1:12:46] healing strengthening encouraging
[1:12:49] raising us up we're
[1:12:50] walking it now one day we're going to
[1:12:51] take that joyful last step into eternity
[1:12:53] why
[1:12:54] he's pouring into us now what we need
[1:12:56] for a perfect delivery
[1:12:57] into a new body brother braham said i
[1:12:59] believe that heaven is a place just as
[1:13:01] real as this
[1:13:02] we don't set up there to eternity just
[1:13:04] sit there on a cloud we don't just strum
[1:13:06] our harp
[1:13:06] for all here forever or from here
[1:13:09] forever but we're going to a real place
[1:13:12] and we're going to do things you got a
[1:13:14] to-do list in heaven
[1:13:16] we're going to do things activities yes
[1:13:19] we're going to live we're going to work
[1:13:21] we're going to enjoy we're going to live
[1:13:24] don't get too worried we're going to
[1:13:25] work
[1:13:27] think about it what he's beginning to
[1:13:29] describe has some
[1:13:30] sound about what's happening now we're
[1:13:32] going to live we're going to work we're
[1:13:33] going to enjoy we're going to live we're
[1:13:34] going to life to a real eternal life
[1:13:36] we're going to a heaven a paradise
[1:13:40] what am i doing here well i think i'm
[1:13:41] living i'm think i'm working i'm
[1:13:43] supposed to be enjoying
[1:13:44] and one day i'll be there i'll be living
[1:13:46] i'll be working i'll be enjoying
[1:13:48] if that's what's coming to let that be
[1:13:50] now
[1:13:51] let me live now let me work now let me
[1:13:53] enjoy now
[1:13:54] if that's coming let me have it now
[1:13:57] because remember the influence the
[1:13:58] future ought to have on you
[1:14:00] now so brother abraham describes it
[1:14:03] paragraph 59 but oh my and the kingdom
[1:14:05] of god there is no death there is no
[1:14:07] sorrow
[1:14:09] there's no need of those things these
[1:14:11] things of the world
[1:14:13] he says but we've passed from this thing
[1:14:14] into the realities of god
[1:14:16] where we struggle so far hard to find
[1:14:18] through science the more scientific we
[1:14:20] get the more death we bring ourselves
[1:14:22] we're fighting and losing battle there
[1:14:23] so turn loose of it
[1:14:26] turn loose of the natural and get a hold
[1:14:28] of the supernatural
[1:14:29] turn loose of the things that are and
[1:14:31] get a hold of the things that are to be
[1:14:34] by faith believe jesus christ is the son
[1:14:36] of god tonight
[1:14:37] and accept him he is the one
[1:14:41] a few paragraphs later he's gone to
[1:14:43] prepare a place a perfect place where no
[1:14:45] evil exists no sickness exists no old
[1:14:47] age exists
[1:14:47] no death exists
[1:14:52] if that's what exists then then i have a
[1:14:54] right to claim it now
[1:14:56] right how can you have healing now
[1:14:59] because there's a well body there
[1:15:02] he's gone to prepare a place where no
[1:15:04] evil exists no sickness exists no old
[1:15:05] age exists no death exists
[1:15:06] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[1:15:09] perfection
[1:15:10] and you have to be perfect to get there
[1:15:16] so when will your perfection come it's
[1:15:19] right now
[1:15:21] it's a perfect place calling to a
[1:15:22] perfect you
[1:15:24] and it ought to be bringing out the
[1:15:25] perfect you now
[1:15:27] why because you need it now just as a
[1:15:30] baby in the womb needs it then the
[1:15:32] mother begins to crave for it
[1:15:33] god knows you need it so he begins to
[1:15:36] send it
[1:15:37] the body begins to crave it people begin
[1:15:39] to crave it they begin to call for
[1:15:41] why they need it and god begins to send
[1:15:43] it what before the development of you
[1:15:45] now so that who you are at the time when
[1:15:48] you're fully developed and ready the
[1:15:49] baby will come when it's ready right
[1:15:52] it comes into another reality and
[1:15:54] brother is using that
[1:15:55] as a type to get us to understand the
[1:15:57] things that are to be
[1:15:58] and the life that is before us and that
[1:16:00] there's a perfect reality calling us out
[1:16:02] of this reality
[1:16:03] into that reality but we're developing
[1:16:06] into that perfection now
[1:16:09] he talked about how in the delivery of a
[1:16:11] child how that you watch that mother she
[1:16:13] could be just as ornery as she can be
[1:16:15] but just before she comes to deliver a
[1:16:18] sweetness comes over her
[1:16:20] why it's because the baby's coming you
[1:16:22] tell me how that that chain
[1:16:24] changes things so he says this and
[1:16:26] things that are to be this is my last
[1:16:27] statement from that message
[1:16:30] oh little children do you feel the need
[1:16:32] of that vitamin tonight
[1:16:34] that's something because now notice how
[1:16:37] he's placing it
[1:16:38] not we're just not sitting sitting there
[1:16:40] here twiddling our thumbs
[1:16:42] waiting for a change he says there's a
[1:16:44] body waiting yonder
[1:16:46] there's a body waiting to be received
[1:16:48] people don't be deceived don't be
[1:16:50] deceived the devil is a deceiver
[1:16:53] even the wedding garment you must wear
[1:16:56] it it must be
[1:16:59] and so i it would imp i emphasize this
[1:17:01] the devil's trying to keep you from this
[1:17:03] truth
[1:17:04] trying to hide this we're at the evening
[1:17:06] time the earthly body
[1:17:07] is now ready to be dissolved and
[1:17:11] we are preparing can i say now to enter
[1:17:14] into the heavenly and we
[1:17:16] now feel the strange call of god to go
[1:17:20] to this great eden you may not be able
[1:17:22] to have explained it you may not even be
[1:17:24] able to understand what it is
[1:17:26] but your love of this truth your desire
[1:17:28] to be in church
[1:17:29] your desire to serve your desire for joy
[1:17:32] your desire for healing your desire to
[1:17:35] follow god
[1:17:36] your desire for your loved ones is not
[1:17:38] just merely a desire
[1:17:40] to be in the message but it's a desire
[1:17:42] for changing your body
[1:17:44] it's a strong craving to be translated
[1:17:46] it's a strong craving to be liberated
[1:17:48] from this flesh
[1:17:50] strange call of god to go to this great
[1:17:51] eden and before we could be born here
[1:17:54] notice our little bodies cried for
[1:17:56] something that had to be provided
[1:18:00] or we'd be afflicted an afflicted child
[1:18:03] here if we wasn't so if the body the
[1:18:07] baby didn't get what it needed in the
[1:18:08] womb
[1:18:10] it's not going to be the baby it needs
[1:18:12] to be when it comes into this other
[1:18:13] reality
[1:18:16] you following me i can start over
[1:18:21] maybe for your own sake just start amen
[1:18:22] and real loud
[1:18:25] when you talk to somebody and that you
[1:18:26] don't understand each other's language
[1:18:27] you just smile and not right
[1:18:30] yes yes i don't mind if you told my car
[1:18:33] right you just smile and nod
[1:18:37] if the baby doesn't get what it needs
[1:18:39] here it won't be perfect there
[1:18:42] so it gets what it needs in the womb
[1:18:45] from a parent that cares to be perfect
[1:18:48] before it gets there
[1:18:50] so it's perfect when it gets there and
[1:18:53] that's what brother brahm's trying to
[1:18:54] say now
[1:18:55] there's a perfect you there
[1:18:58] and god's gonna give you what you need
[1:19:00] now
[1:19:02] to be perfect when you get there you
[1:19:05] crave it you long for it
[1:19:06] he says there's something that had to be
[1:19:08] provided or we'd be an afflicted child
[1:19:10] here if he wasn't so it must be provided
[1:19:12] now
[1:19:12] he says god has no afflictions up there
[1:19:14] so let's think about it
[1:19:16] if god has no afflictions up there then
[1:19:18] i've got to get what i need for my
[1:19:20] afflictions here
[1:19:22] if there's no afflictions there then i'm
[1:19:24] not waiting for my healing when i get
[1:19:25] there
[1:19:26] i want to claim it now i'm not waiting
[1:19:28] for my joy when i get there
[1:19:30] i want it now i'm not waiting for a
[1:19:32] sound mind
[1:19:33] beyond the curtain of time i want it now
[1:19:36] that's what i wanted now otherwise i'd
[1:19:38] be an afflicted person when i get there
[1:19:40] oh god heal my hurts heal my pains heal
[1:19:43] my disappointments
[1:19:45] now do it now lord
[1:19:48] because god has no afflictions up there
[1:19:50] there everyone perfectly lined up the
[1:19:52] bride just exactly like the groom was
[1:19:55] the word manifested in its season god
[1:19:58] grant tonight children each and every
[1:19:59] one of you
[1:20:01] granted maybe it made this bride may she
[1:20:03] be lined up may she be walking in it
[1:20:05] he said there's a heaven to go to
[1:20:07] there's a hell to stay away from
[1:20:10] and then if you listen to the sermon or
[1:20:11] read he tells
[1:20:14] about going beyond the curtain of time
[1:20:18] do you remember the vision he had
[1:20:21] going up beyond the curtain of time and
[1:20:24] in it and i i've lost
[1:20:26] i've i i've used up all my time i'm
[1:20:28] actually in overtime now
[1:20:30] what are the new overtime rules now in
[1:20:31] the pandemic
[1:20:33] i'm starting on second base how's that
[1:20:34] i'm closer to home than i would have
[1:20:35] been prior to the pandemic
[1:20:37] so i'll close sooner than i would have
[1:20:39] pre coven
[1:20:42] help me get home drive me in somebody
[1:20:44] hit a home run
[1:20:47] brother branham is laying in bed hands
[1:20:49] behind his head
[1:20:51] and he experiences this translation
[1:20:54] and he's in a condition here
[1:20:58] and can look back and see himself there
[1:21:03] see the old man his present
[1:21:04] circumstances his body his weakness
[1:21:06] everything there
[1:21:07] but he's in a different state here and
[1:21:10] and he tells the story going beyond the
[1:21:11] curtain of time
[1:21:13] and instead of maybe embellishing all
[1:21:14] the thing or expressing all the things
[1:21:16] that he says in it let me just share
[1:21:19] the phrase that comes
[1:21:22] right before god shows him this brother
[1:21:24] brahm's laying there the voice speaks to
[1:21:26] him says just keep pressing on
[1:21:28] if you only knew what it was at the end
[1:21:30] of the road
[1:21:32] just keep pressing on so grateful god
[1:21:34] gave this experience to our prophet
[1:21:36] just keep pressing on if you only knew
[1:21:39] what is at the end of the road and what
[1:21:41] does god let him see
[1:21:43] it's at the end of the road and when he
[1:21:46] gets there
[1:21:49] when he's hugging all these different
[1:21:50] people he's experiencing this and he
[1:21:52] says it's beyond sublime it's the most
[1:21:53] sublime thing ever and he's
[1:21:54] described as beyond perfection beyond
[1:21:56] perfection beyond perfection
[1:21:58] and this is what the voice says to him
[1:22:00] this is what you preached was the holy
[1:22:02] ghost
[1:22:04] think about it that's what you have now
[1:22:07] by the new birth
[1:22:08] he says this is perfect love and nothing
[1:22:11] can enter here without it
[1:22:15] now let's invert he's not trying to tell
[1:22:18] you you won't be there
[1:22:19] he's trying to tell you you're
[1:22:20] guaranteed to get there
[1:22:23] right this is your invitation it's not
[1:22:25] oh
[1:22:26] oh perfect love i don't have that
[1:22:29] no he's saying no you've that's what you
[1:22:31] have actually
[1:22:33] and the devil's trying to deceive you
[1:22:35] and make you think you don't have it so
[1:22:37] that when you struggle with contrary
[1:22:38] emotions
[1:22:39] oh i just need perfect love no you just
[1:22:41] need to kind of wake it up
[1:22:42] say i don't need to hate i don't need to
[1:22:44] be bitter
[1:22:46] i don't need to lie i don't need to
[1:22:47] cheat i don't need to worry i don't need
[1:22:48] a friend i got perfect love
[1:22:50] perfect love cast out fear that's what
[1:22:52] this love is for that's what this holy
[1:22:53] ghost is for
[1:22:54] that's what this love divine is for it's
[1:22:56] for these distressing emotions
[1:22:58] it's for times like this times like this
[1:23:00] don't prove i don't got it
[1:23:02] it's times like this when what i got can
[1:23:03] prove itself
[1:23:05] don't think for a moment your hard times
[1:23:07] are proof but in the hard times let what
[1:23:09] you have prove itself
[1:23:13] just keep pressing on if you only knew
[1:23:14] what was at the end of the road and he
[1:23:16] says this is what you preached was
[1:23:17] perfect love
[1:23:19] that's what you have that's why perfect
[1:23:22] love cast out fear
[1:23:24] because fear has torment it has to
[1:23:26] completely cast it out
[1:23:28] he said once they had made it there
[1:23:29] there was none of that no distressing
[1:23:31] emotion no lust
[1:23:32] nothing impure that was when perfect
[1:23:34] love was unrestrained
[1:23:37] and brother brown this is how brother
[1:23:38] branham wrote it and took from rejected
[1:23:40] king and he wrote it in the
[1:23:41] full gospel businesses voice and he says
[1:23:44] at the this and this is i want to end
[1:23:47] with this here
[1:23:51] the man says i said oh god help me
[1:23:54] i i know it's very late it's 11 56
[1:23:56] according to my
[1:23:57] my my clock i i just can we just wake
[1:24:00] ourselves up for a moment we can start
[1:24:02] from the front to the back just kind of
[1:24:03] shake ourselves
[1:24:05] pinch yourself wake up here wake up the
[1:24:07] neighbor in the apartment next door
[1:24:10] just try to use whatever little bit of
[1:24:12] energy you have left to focus on this
[1:24:14] and listen to how he says this because
[1:24:16] this applies to us we've got to see this
[1:24:18] we've got to catch this
[1:24:19] he says oh god help me never let me
[1:24:21] compromise with the word
[1:24:23] let me stay straight on the word i don't
[1:24:25] care what anyone else does
[1:24:27] lord let me press on to that beautiful
[1:24:30] joyful place i'm more convinced
[1:24:34] i don't have it on the slide because i
[1:24:35] just wanted you to focus in your mind's
[1:24:36] eye and in your heart just listen let it
[1:24:38] let it strike you deep within your soul
[1:24:40] i am more convinced than ever in my life
[1:24:42] that it'll take perfect love to enter
[1:24:44] that place
[1:24:45] there was no jealousy no tiredness no
[1:24:48] sickness
[1:24:49] no old age no death only supreme
[1:24:53] beauty and joy if that's what your body
[1:24:57] needs when it's going to get there
[1:24:58] then god your heavenly father knows now
[1:25:01] that he can get rid of jealousy
[1:25:03] he can get rid of tiredness he can get
[1:25:05] rid of sickness
[1:25:06] he can stop the advancement of old age
[1:25:08] and one day
[1:25:09] he will destroy death
[1:25:12] only supreme beauty and joy i'm going to
[1:25:15] be supremely beautiful there
[1:25:18] whatever you do lay aside everything
[1:25:20] else until you get perfect love
[1:25:22] get to where now this is this is instead
[1:25:25] of looking at as well i got to get rid
[1:25:26] of these things before i have perfect
[1:25:28] love no this is what perfect love can do
[1:25:30] for you
[1:25:31] get to where you can love everybody even
[1:25:32] every enemy no matter if the plane is
[1:25:35] rocking the lightning is flashing or the
[1:25:36] guns of the enemy are upon you
[1:25:38] these things do not matter get perfect
[1:25:40] love
[1:25:42] that's the place we ought to come to
[1:25:43] where we can love even our enemies and
[1:25:45] people who hate us and mock us and lie
[1:25:47] about us and offend us and hurt us
[1:25:48] we can get to that place that we love
[1:25:51] our enemies
[1:25:52] and we love those that hurt us and why
[1:25:54] why can you do that because you know
[1:25:56] what's at the end of the road
[1:25:59] because you're i know i'm his daughter i
[1:26:01] know i'm his son i know there's a throne
[1:26:03] of waiting for me
[1:26:03] how can i hate anybody if i know one day
[1:26:06] i'll be their judge
[1:26:08] how can i despise what god's what god
[1:26:10] allows to happen
[1:26:11] why would i let myself under the power
[1:26:13] of an accuser live under the power of an
[1:26:16] abuser
[1:26:16] i can forgive i can go forward i can
[1:26:19] live
[1:26:20] above it because i know at the end of
[1:26:22] the road i'm healed i'm delivered i'm
[1:26:25] pure
[1:26:25] i'm clean i'm saved i'm healed
[1:26:31] he says if you're not saved except jesus
[1:26:33] christ as your savior
[1:26:34] now if you're not baptized in water be
[1:26:37] baptized now
[1:26:38] if you've not received the baptism holy
[1:26:40] spirit receive it now
[1:26:43] press on in that perfect love
[1:26:47] which will take you to that beautiful
[1:26:48] and joyful place
[1:26:50] beyond the curtain of time
[1:26:53] see pressing into that perfect love
[1:26:55] isn't what we do to get there
[1:26:58] it's what we do before we're there if
[1:27:01] not the perfect love can enter there
[1:27:04] it's not something you're given at the
[1:27:05] door it's something you receive
[1:27:09] it's part of the invitation it's part of
[1:27:10] the earnest is part of the down payment
[1:27:15] so with our hearts just open now i want
[1:27:17] to
[1:27:18] i want to be able just to seal this
[1:27:20] thought in my heart so i could take
[1:27:22] liberty into the next step
[1:27:24] if we could just bow our heads and close
[1:27:26] our eyes
[1:27:30] i feel impressed to tell you
[1:27:35] to step out of the shadows of broken
[1:27:37] dreams
[1:27:43] to break the cycle
[1:27:46] to stop living in fear of it
[1:27:50] there's a voice calling beyond the
[1:27:52] clouds
[1:27:54] there's a tug can you feel it
[1:28:01] keep pressing towards this joy
[1:28:06] because it's worth it
[1:28:11] as abraham rejoiced to see and he was
[1:28:14] gushing with excitement
[1:28:16] and god showed him i believe that we can
[1:28:19] rejoice to see
[1:28:21] and he will show you
[1:28:24] by little and little he'll keep showing
[1:28:27] you
[1:28:29] piece by piece as you have need of it
[1:28:32] he'll keep showing you and as a heavenly
[1:28:36] father that knows there's a body waiting
[1:28:37] for you
[1:28:39] and that is brother has drawn the image
[1:28:41] and things that are to be that we're
[1:28:42] going to be delivered out of this pest
[1:28:43] house into a new body
[1:28:45] he's given you everything you need now
[1:28:48] to not be afflicted there
[1:28:52] it's things that are to be changing the
[1:28:53] way things are now
[1:28:57] i believe that we can see
[1:29:00] what god wants us to see behind the
[1:29:02] beyond the curtain of time
[1:29:05] do you believe that i have not seen nor
[1:29:08] heard neither is into the heart of men
[1:29:10] the things that god hath prepared for
[1:29:11] them that love him
[1:29:13] but he reveals them to us by his spirit
[1:29:16] and i believe we can ask god to show us
[1:29:19] what's at the end of the road
[1:29:21] he said just keep pressing on if you
[1:29:22] only knew it was at the end of the road
[1:29:24] i believe we can ask god to show us
[1:29:26] by little and little what's coming
[1:29:30] brother branham after he had experienced
[1:29:32] that he says it in different places but
[1:29:33] i just
[1:29:34] grabbed a couple where he makes it very
[1:29:36] very plain it's changed me
[1:29:38] i can never be the same anymore it's so
[1:29:42] real it's just as real as i'm looking at
[1:29:44] you
[1:29:45] just that reel so there's no fear
[1:29:48] so think of that think of that in light
[1:29:51] of what
[1:29:53] uh of what is expressed
[1:29:58] in these other statements that he's made
[1:30:00] to this point
[1:30:01] in things that are to be
[1:30:04] that it's more real there's no fear
[1:30:07] because it's real i know it's real i can
[1:30:09] never be the same no more
[1:30:10] the reality changed who he was before he
[1:30:14] comes to it
[1:30:16] he says another place the one visit
[1:30:17] there to me has made me a different man
[1:30:20] i can never never never be the same
[1:30:23] brother branham that i was
[1:30:26] i said well brother aaron does that mean
[1:30:27] i have to have a vision beyond the
[1:30:28] curtain of time no
[1:30:29] we're not prophets we don't get those
[1:30:31] kind of visions but you as a son or
[1:30:32] daughter of god he can give you a
[1:30:34] revelation
[1:30:35] and the revelation that you need to
[1:30:37] change you in your present circumstance
[1:30:39] and i believe that right now whatever
[1:30:40] you have need of you could just let it
[1:30:42] lift up within your heart
[1:30:43] and let your heart christ say lord give
[1:30:45] me the revelation i need for right now
[1:30:47] even if it's just for the next 24 hours
[1:30:50] lord give me what i need right now
[1:30:52] to conduct myself with joy and miss this
[1:30:54] trial
[1:30:55] you've allowed to come to pass let me
[1:30:58] get by
[1:30:58] minute by minute if i need to lord but i
[1:31:00] need something for now i worry too much
[1:31:02] about the future i'm burning bridges
[1:31:03] before i come to them i'm obsessing
[1:31:05] about this and i'm worried about that
[1:31:06] and i've got this plans and those plans
[1:31:08] and i'm all worried about what the
[1:31:09] future is going to be like am i going to
[1:31:10] get married can i ever afford to buy a
[1:31:12] house will i get good grades in school
[1:31:14] what about this being restored that
[1:31:15] we're all so worried about the future
[1:31:16] and we can't even live happy in the
[1:31:18] present tense oh god give me what i need
[1:31:20] right now to walk
[1:31:21] to walk free
[1:31:25] even if it's just you showing me where i
[1:31:28] am in eternity
[1:31:30] if that's all it will take to change me
[1:31:32] god show me
[1:31:33] let me be convinced of it let me know
[1:31:36] beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:31:38] that i'm coming to it and i can't miss
[1:31:40] it
[1:31:42] bless you today bless you whose hearts
[1:31:44] are bowed and heads are bout and hands
[1:31:46] are raised
[1:31:50] god let me be convinced more than ever
[1:31:52] that it's already done
[1:31:54] i need to have this kind of confidence
[1:31:56] and assurance that you love me
[1:31:58] and loving me you have what's best for
[1:32:00] me
[1:32:01] and knowing that you've chosen me
[1:32:02] beforehand that your love is elective
[1:32:04] therefore if it's victory ahead
[1:32:06] it's victory now if i'm gonna be happy
[1:32:10] and shout and rejoice and dance on those
[1:32:12] streets and i might as well cut a rug
[1:32:14] while i'm here
[1:32:16] if i'm gonna praise and shout over there
[1:32:18] i might as well start doing it now
[1:32:21] brother lucas was sharing with me how
[1:32:23] even science has tapped into the fact
[1:32:25] that if you act happy you get happy
[1:32:29] because it's an immutable truth of god's
[1:32:30] word the body's got to obey that your
[1:32:32] confession
[1:32:33] and activity and being active and doing
[1:32:36] and stepping out and being positive in
[1:32:37] those things
[1:32:38] it's not mind over matter it's you
[1:32:41] minding the things that really matter
[1:32:43] and setting your mind on the things that
[1:32:44] really matter and say god
[1:32:46] i don't know what's going to happen now
[1:32:47] persecution affliction rejection
[1:32:50] lost dreams and hopes that are dashed
[1:32:53] and things that may not
[1:32:54] i work out the way i wanted to but i'm
[1:32:56] looking over it to a joy which is set
[1:32:58] before me
[1:32:59] and you told me to rejoice and leap for
[1:33:01] joy and be exceeding
[1:33:02] god because my name is written in the
[1:33:04] lamb's book of life because i have a
[1:33:06] great reward
[1:33:06] waiting for me in heaven lord let that
[1:33:08] reality raise
[1:33:10] and raise and raise in my heart
[1:33:14] god bless you if there's a with the
[1:33:15] heads are bowed now if there'd be a
[1:33:17] broken heart or someone in a difficult
[1:33:19] situation
[1:33:20] that would want to stand up as just even
[1:33:24] activity
[1:33:25] of saying i'm leaving that which is
[1:33:26] behind behind by standing up i'm raising
[1:33:29] myself up into these heavenly places
[1:33:31] i'm taking my position in christ i'm
[1:33:33] looking to
[1:33:34] jesus i'm considering him and i'm saying
[1:33:37] lord
[1:33:37] i'm tied to something greater than my
[1:33:40] flesh i'm tied to something greater than
[1:33:42] my memories i'm tied to something
[1:33:44] greater than my affections
[1:33:45] oh god i stand in your presence now
[1:33:49] as a testimony that i'm healed that i'm
[1:33:51] saved and i'm delivered
[1:33:53] god bless you all god bless you could we
[1:33:56] stand together with these
[1:33:57] all of us together now stand let us pray
[1:34:00] our gracious heavenly father

[1:34:05] it is so beautiful lord to feel you here
[1:34:08] speaking to our hearts with such clarity
[1:34:11] lord i pray that through the the breadth
[1:34:13] of this and the length of him
[1:34:15] that you have been present near your
[1:34:17] children lord
[1:34:18] expressing to them what you would have
[1:34:20] them to hear
[1:34:22] lord one day a little boy showed up at a
[1:34:24] large gathering with
[1:34:25] two fish and five loaves of bread
[1:34:29] and he was gonna eat that for himself
[1:34:31] maybe
[1:34:32] little lunch that a mother cooked packed
[1:34:35] for her son and
[1:34:36] little did she know that she cooked for
[1:34:38] over five thousand that day
[1:34:43] but it was you that broke it up
[1:34:48] and what was meant for one was meant for
[1:34:50] all
[1:34:51] i pray lord you take these things that
[1:34:53] have been broken up and these things
[1:34:54] have been spread out and dispersed and
[1:34:56] made every single person here today
[1:34:59] receive substance from you now lord
[1:35:02] wherever they may be in this journey
[1:35:04] whatever they may be going through
[1:35:06] lord lighten their load relieve their
[1:35:09] anxious mind free their burdened hearts
[1:35:15] lord i speak to whoever would hear this
[1:35:18] may they find that tomorrow morning is
[1:35:20] lighter than mondays usually are
[1:35:22] a little bit more ambition less less of
[1:35:24] a darkness lord
[1:35:25] more motivation to get the day started
[1:35:27] and get the job done
[1:35:28] but i'm praying that for all who would
[1:35:30] hear all that are here
[1:35:31] under uh under anxiety and apprehension
[1:35:34] or they'd be loosed and freed and
[1:35:36] delivered
[1:35:37] lord surely above all we would desire
[1:35:39] that people would come to know you in
[1:35:40] the forgiveness of sins and
[1:35:43] and the baptism of the holy ghost or
[1:35:44] that's that's what we present before you
[1:35:46] but may we who might not even know you
[1:35:49] in that way first begin to experience
[1:35:51] you
[1:35:51] in deliverance and healing and joy and
[1:35:54] know
[1:35:55] that you're real give us a taste lord of
[1:35:59] the divine
[1:36:01] give us a taste of something
[1:36:03] supernatural

[1:36:07] bless them today encourage them
[1:36:11] to believe that when your son said it is
[1:36:15] finished
[1:36:18] he didn't just do it for me he did it as
[1:36:20] me
[1:36:22] and i could say it's finished it's
[1:36:24] finished it's finished
[1:36:26] for me the victory is mine
