TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know there's a lot that is expressed in this uh this phrase here and even to the point to where it might be um you know thought provoking and in large degree as far as Wonder lust and wonder lost um my thesis statement is finding the Wonder of Christ in an age of wonderlust in an age where the things of Christ are so devalued and the value of the word is being smothered over the things of God are being lost in um in apathy or just the agnostic there's a lot of uh even as it said I think it's the agnostic that just admits that you're just being lazy they don't want to wrestle with the real questions but there's a there's a lot that this age is characterized by that I feel that Christ has just lost its Grandeur it's kind of lost that attraction because we've allowed ourselves to be pulled in these other directions and so my whole thought in this is that we would be awakened to the glory of Christ and just be thrilled with him and excited about the things of God and so with Wonder lost and we're just going to track uh what we were on Wednesday night we're just going to kind of back up and go over this so with Wonder loss what we're looking at is when we lose our sense of all for the things of God uh even to the point if somebody was to testify and say um you know I this happened or I was healed of this or God did this and God did that that we kind of get jaded which the sense of Jade it is like did you see it so much it just kind of that's no big deal been there done that and kind of loses the thrill and so Wonder loss is when we lose our sense of all and even our respect and reverence um for God where we're not fearful of him and we're not thinking about him and reverencing the fact that he is a just God or we don't reverence the fact that he's a God that wants our praise and wants our fellowship and it kind of encompasses a loss of excitement for the things of God and maybe Wonder lost I'm wanting us to consider whether or not there has been some uh watering down of our amazement of Christ uh brother bam uses the statement in the church age book I wonder for efficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst so we may be impressed but if you're not impressed to the sufficiency in other words does what it's supposed to then there's some amazement that's been lost there's some benefit that we're not receiving we used Isaiah 9 6 on Wednesday night as our text and our opening scripture and how it says about Jesus Christ that his name Shall be Called wonderful it says his name Shall be Called It means he will be and I can say He is wonderful to be wonderful it means he's full of wonder and if Christ is full of wonder then there's wonder that you can experience if he's full of wonder and we're to see Jesus Christ in every verse then there should be wonder that we're experiencing if he's if he's revealing himself today and we see the revelation of Jesus Christ and he's making himself known to us then that should be full of wonder and and as wonderful speaks of something that is marvelous or a Marvel and even the word marvel itself is a miracle so Christ is a miracle Miracles ought to excite our faith Miracles vindicate God's presence and there's a lot that we could say about what a Marvel is it's something that causes astonishment it is something that would strike us with wonder to be shocked to be amazed that's what I'm thinking about in terms of this all or this Wonder of Jesus Christ and brother Brahm says about Christ and the word he said it shouldn't thrill us should be fresh every day just new to us all the time just Thrills us to feed and feast on the word of God and the way that this has struck me and I would say even the way that the word of God has been striking me is there's uh there's a way that and I can say let's just put it on ourselves and not accuse anybody who handles the word of God of doing this but we use the word as kind of a a a caudible to beat ourselves or some kind of hammer to inflict wounds and we're just constantly beating ourselves and we read this and say all the words should thrill me it doesn't then something's wrong with me or I'm not a Believer I don't have the Holy Ghost there's a way that we use the word of God to kind of measure ourselves short as opposed to using the word of God as a measure of what God's promised and so what I've taken to do and when I look into the word of God is if he says that you shall be born again that I don't lament that I'm not born again I just believe hey there's a promise of a new birth if I if I see that the new birth carries with it certain promises and I'm not experiencing them I don't say oh great I'm never going to have them I just say that's what I ought to believe for him and so when he says it should thrill us I don't believe that this is Judgment if it doesn't it's just it's opportunity Unity for us to experience the thrill of Christ on a daily basis and if it's not fresh every day it's something that you can wake up every morning and when you two you put your two feet on the ground you say Lord make it fresh I want it fresh today my brother Matthew was known at a restaurant in the Dallas Fort Worth area he was literally known as fresh fries and there was a manager of a barbecue restaurant that said he was looking through a phone book one day and there was my brother's picture and he goes Hey look it's fresh fries because my brother always says I want fresh fries wherever he's ordering it even if he's not ordering fries he says if you don't know I want fresh fries and that's something that he expects it's something that maybe you asked for when you go to fast food establishments on a daily basis is you want it fresh that's what we have every right to ask God for is it as it fresh it should be fresh every day and just thrill us to feed and feast on the word of God this is a promise and so this is what we're looking at is Awakening The Wonder of Christ something that Thrills us to be thrilled by him to find him exciting and maybe in the way of analogy for a young you know a young couple when they get they meet first meet and they first fall in love everything's new and exciting and every notification that comes through causes some sort of excitement and it used to be that you would run to the mailbox or you'd see the Western Pony or whatever it was the Pony Express coming by or the train would pull up to the train depot and you'd be out waiting for the mailbag off the train and waiting for that letter from the girl you like or the boy you like and there was always this excitement and these butterflies and this thrill to talk to him to hear him to see him and and it went through time love can mature towards not that type of love but there still should be an excitement there there should be still it should be a thrill I think that's the way it should be with Christ that we still find him exciting we still find him engaging it's wonderful to go out to dinner and you see a a couple that has been married for many many years or maybe there's ones that you know and you've watched them could be your parents or some Associates they've been married for 50 60 years but they still just they hold one another's hands and they still talk to each other and they still share things and it's it's like man they've been together in the same room for 70 years and they still have things to talk about and I think that's a beautiful thing when there's still something about somebody that intrigues you and you find exciting and that's when I'm wanting to capture with the thought of Wonder loss is let's not lose the Wonder of Christ now with wonderlust that were their Wonder lost it's that combination has the Germanic Roots it's a strong longing for impulse that would be the lust part for wondering and wondering it's this is not I'm not using wonderlust in the sense that you enjoy travel or you like going on Hikes and just seeing which way it'll take you I'm looking more to this just inclination and this Lust For pointless uh roaming for this aimless wandering aimless travel to where it's like I just feel I just want to meander I just want to go it doesn't matter to me what what the end point is I just I just want to be just Journey it's kind of a restlessness and one way I definitely want to capture this it's a fruitlessness to where all they're measuring is the journey and not the destination and so wonderlust uh is being used to look at all the different Pursuits the aimless Pursuits that we have in our lives and the things that we engage in and the wonderlust is is referring to things that we just kind of are driven to do things that we like to do that are aimless that are pointless that are fruitless that are causing the loss of Wonder for the things that are real and of God the things that are actually that are simple and and not extravagant in a worldly sense it's not the glitter but it's something that's glowing and so that's what's encompassed in the phrase wonderlust for me and we touched on this Wednesday night and I'm really just building right off of this is that there are many meaningless Pursuits that are uh that are driven by dopamine as well maybe come back to that towards the end it says dopamine cycle it's a chemical release in the brain there's things that we are doing that are triggering triggering a release of a chemical in our brain and it's causing us to kind of get into this cycle that is robbing us of The Wonder of God because we're kind of caught in this this Loop this addictive Loop in our flesh and in our minds and so restoring Wonder begins with identifying those influences that have stolen The Wonder of Christ that's where we're wanting to begin is looking at the things that have stolen The Wonder of Christ that's how we begin with restoring it so today is very very practical uh and and in that it might seem very simple and you'll be able to identify so quickly with everything that we share today but I really want you to focus because I wouldn't want the Simplicity of it to kind of lose its gravity oh well that's simple because I think this is very very heavy very very significant and my title today is the death of patience and for the doctors in the room that might make them Flinch a little bit but it's a different patience uh the the death of patients is my title and I want to give you an outline at the outset so as you consider this title write that down the death of patients I want to give you my outline and we're going to begin first by going back through what we've ministered on reward in rewards because uh I thought I was done with the subject of rewards uh it's not up to me and I think it's largely up to you and what your desires are and I had a lot of feedback from one saying man I really enjoyed that series on rewards we're excited about the next one but I saw God just bring it right back into view so we're going to be carrying on some themes from the series on rewards but patience the first thing I want to look at is patience leads to Rewards we're going to build this through scripture and you can keep that title slide up there um we'll come to this next brother brother Mitch I know I didn't give you much Direction but patience leads to rewards and what I want to look at is how that there's this process of creating motivation that God has and that he has a way of reinforcing certain things this is God's way this is a scriptural way this is God knowing how the human works and he's using this principle the principle of patience is used in the context of attaining to blessings and rewards and certain things and the next part will be patience in this morning hopefully we can get to it this morning is that patience is an essential attribute of God it is something that is intrinsic in him it's part of his very nature God is patience and as a result it's a necessary attribute as a child of God so their patience is essential to the nature of God and as his children it's essential to our nature as a Believer by birth patience is in US and then what I want to wrap up with today so I'm just kind of giving you this outline so you can kind of look at this outline to know where we're at in terms of whether or not we're close to a close uh and then the last part I want to come back to the death of patience and it's the death of patients that has resulted in wonderlust and wonder loss and if I could just say this at the outset before we go on to the next patients leads to Rewards I want to generalize the age that we're living in and maybe generalizing some of our experiences I would say that if you're not finding this experience God bless you it's wonderful but I believe that we can be characterized in this age as becoming increasingly impatient and whether it be this restlessness to experience the thrill uh this uh you know just one particular emotion it's got to be changed it's got to be some sort of pattern interrupt there's got to be something uh to where we want to experience a new emotion a new experience we want to do something else do something different and we're constantly needing something uh to kind of keep us engaged and we just easily become impatient it's kind of just the nature of the world we're living in where everything needs to be quick and needs to be ready right away and we want to experience things with the on an increased timeline I think that ties into wonderlust this impatience I just want to meander I just want to go I feel restless and to be impatient it means to be restless under existing conditions so considering existing conditions or where we're at now is someone someone is impatient and this is kind of giving the definition of Patience by inversion someone who cannot bear or endure their current state so when things are a certain way they just can't bear it they just can't stand it and it's just impatience they want to change things they want they don't want it to be the way that it is and so that's what is thought of in patience and that I see in the death of patients it results in the resurrection of impatience so now in patience leads to rewards now we're going to develop this part for a little bit here we've already covered a lot uh in terms of rewards so what I would say is as we look at the same scriptures look for a deeper connection instead of just saying this is review sometimes I do and maybe some of you may be kind of used to me going over review and tying things in so you might be like I got that I got that you're just kind of waiting for me don't do that look for a deeper connection and and for deeper understanding of these scriptures because I'm not just going over them to review them I'm going over them now because we've already gone into it I want to go deeper and if it's not deeper I just want to turn the side over and say now look at this side of it and so rewards are earned through patience and so there's a patience that leads to rewards it's through patients that we earn rewards and this being patient now this is where we're starting to get into the definition of patience and being patient is the process as as we are patient it builds in it inspiration and as patient leads to rewards it's this process of motivating us to the reward and so God has a way that patience is so critical to motivating us to rewards and so really I'm asking that you concentrate with me this morning it's a very very uh um you know concentrate and I'll say that brother Lupe I kept thinking about your amens as I was studying I was like I'm gonna need I'm looking forward to his amens I'm looking for a hit to him dragging me through this material tomorrow I was just thinking about that so it's nice just to sit right next to you there and so I'll say this draw on what you know God is already these are things you understand as a Believer we've been covering these through 10 Services 11 Services now this very similar subject you already know these things so start drawing on that for to bring you deeper into an understanding of Christ Hebrews chapter 6 verses 10 to 12 and hopefully I can just go through about a half a dozen scriptures or so or maybe a dozen real quick on this it says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love we've Amplified that so God is mindful of your work and labor of love which you have showed towards his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end so God knows your labor he won't forget it so everyone ought to show the same diligence diligently stay laboring and working and be perseverant because to the full assurance that you might receive the hope that is at the end so he says that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises so this has been a theme through all the sermons on rewards and a theme about earning rewards is through faith and patience you might inherit what God has promised as a reward to those who work in labor of love and what Paul is doing here as he says this and shares this with them he's promoting the virtue of endurance and this is a particular word here for that's translated to patience and it's combining the the Macross which is long uh when it speaks of of a place it's something that's remote or far off if it speaks of time it's something that's Long and Lasting and then it's thumas which is Passion or wrath so it puts passion or wrath off it's something that puts uh emotions at Bay so this patience is long uh of enduring and long with passion and along with anger like you put off uh things that might move you or cause you to be unsettled it says that through patience through faith and patience you might inherit the promises this use of this word patience speaks of one who's able to regulate their emotions so that you're not quick to satisfy some urge or some desire to do something through faith and patience there's some restraint there there's some either the Motions there's a certain emotion that you want to last and to endure a desire a diligence that is long lasting the perseverance that is long lasting and then the this not being quick to satisfy other urges it's really a beautiful word picture that's painted the way that it's used in Scripture but recognize how that Paul and I'll call it this the marriage of faith and patience there's a union of these two principles and it's a necessary Union in order for Faith to be expressed and for our faith to be rewarded you have faith but without the patience faith cannot be expressed you have faith but without patience your faith will wither your faith will wither under Triumph so Revelations chapter 13 verse 10 it says he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword and everybody goes that escalated quickly and so as it is speaking of the judgments that will come upon those that lead into captivity they will be led into captivity he that killed the sword will be killed by the sword it says this here is the patience and the faith of the Saints so the faith of the Saints says that God is a rewarder that God will judge and as the enemy has done unto me that my faith tells me that God is a God that rewards and God will judge the enemies by the measure that they met out but it's not just the faith of the Saints but it's also the patience of the Saints Faith would be the ability and the capacity to believe something and to believe that it's true patience would then be the ability or the capacity The Virtue to endure unto it you believe something and that's great but patience is what's going to lead you Faith then is what's going to hold you and keep that Faith kind of as a marriage it's a union faith and patience working together so that you can see what your faith believed in and so these two are working together brother Abraham says in the Statue of a perfect man you could go back and look at how he uses this that if you have real genuine Faith you have real genuine patience if you have real genuine Faith then you have real genuine patience because they work together something that they are combined so in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 36 this is looking again at this how patience leads to rewards as it said that their God is a not he will not forget your work in labor of love so show diligence unto the end to receive your reward and that look to those as examples who through faith and patience have received their reward and faith in patience now married together we see in here in verse chapter 10 verse 36 for you have needed patience that after you have done the will of God which would be Faith after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise and this is another another term for patients that is used it's the same patient's Greek word in Revelations 13. but this is something that is used that's translated to endure to preserve it speaks to something sustaining something that um is it speaks to to preserve and also to persevere that's the thought behind it and this is you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God doing the will of God is faithfulness doing the will of God is being faithful that you might receive the promise so notice you need patience that so if you look at this as you do the will of God and as you believe you need patience so that you can receive the promise brother Brandon says specifically now faithfulness and patience go together faithfulness and patience go together and now when the Bible speaks of this character of patience here and one way there's a Greek word that's translated to patients and it speaks of having something that endures and lasts but then also to where you're slow to wrath you're slow to the negative things you're you're long on the positive things maybe one way to speak of it but then it speaks this patient speaks of one who's not easily deterred speaks of one who doesn't swerve from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith despite the circumstances so if someone has patience they stay the course regardless of the opposition speaks of one who's not easily swerved from what their purpose and their loyalty is that's what patience then is this continuing of faith not being swerved from my faith not being tossed to and throw and that to and fro and that was kind of the thought behind wonderlust this that you have need of patience so you can remain deliberate that you could be preserved and persevere now in Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3 wherefore seeing you are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses which Paul can say be followers of them that through faith and patience have inherited the promises he says with with this cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and that would go back to chapter 10 you have need of patience because you have things that try to beset you and you have things that try to hinder you and let us run with patience the race that is set before us Paul does not say just run and he says run that you might obtain and in order to obtain you must run patiently this is an important characteristic and there's so many different scriptures the the real gift was being actually this past week was just finding the right ones that could be anointed and quickened because there's dozens and dozens and dozens of scriptures on long-suffering and patience and enduring that all come from the same root it's run with patience the race that is set before us having this example looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured now that word endured there is the same word that's translated to run this race with patience it's the same word and you have need of patience now if this is important principle here I think maybe my my energy and my enthusiasm is causing me maybe just to uh uh to go to go quick uh it's I've I believe that God can impress upon us a better understanding of patience today and and enduring because it's the same word you have need of patience and it says he endured the cross and I know what we immediately begin to think when he endured the cross is we think in terms of the blood and the Affliction and the weight and all the nationalists and all the physical suffering and I think that we need to have a much broader more daily view of what it means to suffer as we've touched on before and what it means to be patient he says he who for the joy which set before him was patient endured the cross despising the shame for the joy set before and speaks of the reward what was to come despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured same word for patience such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds which would speak against to the endurance the faithfulness that you would not give up that you would not lose hope that you would not uh stop pressing that you would not as he said in chapter six show the same diligence to the full Assurance of the Hope in the end be like those who through faith and patience inherited the promises go through says you have need of patience that you might receive the promise goes through the Hall of Fame by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith and then says that we ought to run this race with patients thinking of the ultimate example Jesus Christ who used patience to be to in order to carry the cross which is his burden and to sit down at the right hand of God so he says look at this example of patience lest ye lose your patience look at this example of patience unless you be wearied in faint in your minds and so that being weary and fit in your minds would be your your patience giving out so Paul is creating motivation and this might be maybe a unique unique way to say it and I don't know hopefully that this will make more senses to go forward he's created Motivation by establishing expectations full Assurance of the Hope under the end inheriting the promises uh that you might receive the promise and looking unto Jesus who for the joy was set before him he's trying to establish some expectation not immediate expectation but this expectation that for now you need to endure for now you need to be patient for now you need to be long on uh on waiting now you need to be long on perseverance you need to be long on diligence you need to be long On Believing you need to be long on faith and that needs to be your long position for all the day Traders then in Romans Chapter 2 verses 6 to 7 and I got to go quickly through these different ones on patience leads to rewards speaking of the nature of God who will render to every man according to his deeds this is what God's going to do to them who by patient continuance enduring patient continuance in well-doing seek for Glory and Honor immortality eternal life so it's going to reward them in eternal life going to reward them with life abundantly to them who by patience in doing well seek for Glory and Honor immortality now it's telling us it's okay to seek for this right now I know that it's certainly qualified within the context of scripture but by patient continuance it's not just seeking Glory not just seeking honor and immortality you can only do it by patient continuance Paul is attaching the receipt receiving of God's reward to the character of patience that when you believe that there's this patience that's going to draw you and lead you to your ultimate reward in James chapter 1 verses 2 3 and 4 it says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patients have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing now I want to see where we're at in this I had some things that okay we'll be coming to it here in a moment so I just we'll be able to move a little bit quicker here the trying of your faith so you have faith remember the marriage and the union of of faith and patience it's the trying of your faith that works patience that gives patients an opportunity if this if you think the trying of your faith gives patience a job to do right trying of your faith excites patience the trend of your faith means it's your turn patience I believe I believe I believe opposition opposition faces it's my turn patience says it's my turn let me step in let me step in now as a companion uh to Faith if you've got real genuine Faith you've got real genuine patience so faith cannot be Faith unless it has something up against it and so with that up against it I don't have to have faith that there's mud out there right the condition of my children's shoes tells me that there's mud out there but it's faith in order for it to be faith it has something against it so in the face of something against it if you have real genuine Faith you have real genuine patients that kind of steps up behind that faith it says don't worry I got your back and I'm going to hold you up I'm going to Bear you on and I'm going to keep you from swerving and I'm gonna I'm gonna make this Faith last I'm long on this I I'm going to make this Faith last and so then it says but let patience have her perfect work so now if the trying of your faith Works patience we might think oh I'm trying I'm trying oh I'm impatient be impatient don't get impatient patience has a perfect and complete work let patients have her perfect work in other words the trying of your faith gives patients a job let her finish your job let it finish that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing what a beautiful couple faith and patience working together to see that we are made complete perfect and entire lacking in nothing what a com what a connection to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end and a full reward and receiving the promises that you might find yourself perfect and entire wanting nothing says there's absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith there's no other way for it to announce itself there's no other way to have it there's no other way for it to be utilized except that our faith be tested and tried use this statement already this is where we're I think you could see the connection so easily with rewards from the church age book chapter six brother Brown says God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development you have faith you're born again still with the Holy Ghost same thing you have it you're a Son of God you're in the family and now you with that Faith there's the patience God's will for us is perfection and you have to have patience and patience is the process of character development now this is what brother Brandon's amplifying when he makes that statement and this is applies to us God's will first says Perfection waiting on God Waiting for God this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages the theatorian church age how he commends them I think maybe we'll get into it uh in a later service patience is Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they serve God that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward this is in the context again of faith and patience working together to the fullness and so patience is Central to our Perfection faith is Central uh faith is Central to Faith in patients working together uh forming this Union and this Alliance uh one supporting the other and we see that patience is perfection is patience and that's the process of character development now with all these many scriptures and I can use dozens more and you those of you have already flipped your concordance to check off all the ones I'm using no so many more scriptures that we could use and if patience and maybe maybe it's just not as much color to it as I would have wanted maybe I wanted to go deeper in this but I have to press on if patience is this critical to character development brother bam says Perfection is patient so this you know the mark of this age is perfection you think of the weight be therefore perfect as your heavenly father is perfect so patience is critical to this process of character development if patience is critical to perfect Faith then what what would be the hindrance like what would hinder that process of character development or maybe another way of putting it is if if the devil just by reading the quotes realizes that patience is necessary that faith is the gift of God and and that's more precious than gold and then he finds out that the trial of your faith is more precious than gold and so the devil feels like well man I can't win because the faith is they've already got faith that's the gift of God and then if I try their faith and and try to hinder their faith that's even more precious than gold and he's thinking so beware can I devalue their gold and he realizes ah patience if I could get if I could throw a monkey wrench into their plans it's going to be through this Avenue and this channel of being impatient or that's the way to interrupt the process on put it in the mind of a conspiring devil who's making due use of every opportunity walketh about seeking whom he may devour now if patience is that important think about what the devil would want to attack and now consider this and this is where it's very very practical as I believe Wednesday night was ultimately and as we probably will be through the remainder of this particular series consider how Modern Life thought about all the different ways I want to say Society the world whatever how Modern Life by Design is manipulating our Humanity by Design uh and and you should you should think in terms of economics when you think of the design of anything why are um uh Coke bottles round and milk carton square right someone's going I prayed about that yesterday and we're asking the real questions somebody's like I I was hoping he would get into this and the reason nice it's cheaper dry room temperature shelf storage is cheaper than refrigerator storage do you want to be able to fit more is this is this practical today or what right those of you been wanting to work at Fry's you're gonna have a leg up on the competition and so you want you want to maximize your space in the refrigerated compartments because of Economics because the cost why is there a light in the refrigerator not one in the freezer right asking the real questions it's economics it's money and so since money is a driving Factor economies economics is the driving factors fellowshipping on Wednesday night that if you're getting something for free then you're you're the commodity right you're you're the one you're the one that's being used in that process and so there's that we want to consider how life by its own design is manipulating our humanity and in doing so it's perverting our patients it's all for economies now I have to just want to refer to this very very quickly and this is not me just taking Liberty uh and kind of shoehorning this in to fit my narrative the original sin was the result of impatience there's a lot of things that are working but there's this idea that Eve is perfect everything's right Perfection Beyond Perfection it's Sublime and the Satan used this draw on her emotions and to cause her to try to act on something for an immediate gain as opposed to waiting on God in his promise brother man said Adam's bride could not wait so Satan's gospel enticed her into impatience she ought to have had faith and patience she ought to been long on the promise that it's an oncoming promise an oncoming thing as brothers said and brother bam says God promised to multiply them but they had to wait until God's time notice that seed of wonderlust took her out of that position of safety and caused her to be pulled into this through impatience drawn into an activity into something that was not a faith so there's if patience is this critical think about how things are designed to warp the quality and character of patients let patients have a perfect work right and if patients if you could get out of the way patients and let her do her thing right you're going to be perfect in the entire wanting nothing so then the whole goal is now if we could just get patients to work in perfectly you could just muddy the waters about patience then that keeps us from the Perfection I think this makes sense at least it does from my vantage point how do those those in the balcony excellent they're getting it there now this role of patients even the definition of patients as the bible translated to continual and enduring and suffering all those different terms that are kind of used as a companion to it the role of patients in Perfection I believe is to easily misunderstood and I won't accuse you of misunderstanding I'll just say it's easy to misunderstand in case you do and I want to be very blunt about this and this is drawing from another a parallel study that I'm doing right now on revisiting the history of the church and the history of Catholicism and reading in great detail through each of the centuries different things that have happened and we do not want to use Catholic theology and the shadows of that that exist in modern Christianity whether it be Protestant or message we do not want to use that to understand patience and endurance and suffering because the Catholic Church would want you to think that suffering is giving all your money to the Catholic church and suffering is you being burned at the stake because you're a heretic and all the atrocities that the Catholic Church imposed upon the Believers upon Christians where poverty was a mark of Christianity and being austere and not having things and and they wanted to use this principle of suffering so that the believer gave everything away and let the priest Live lavishly and Let the church accumulate the wealth and it was all political and they were all Hypocrites and they did not live according to things that they were wanting to impose upon the people and so if I could say this there's almost this fat this DNA within Christianity to turn ourselves into Catholics to where we deserve a Purgatory we deserve to be dark to punish ourselves we that we need to have this suffering and patience is is poverty and patience is physical suffering impatience is crawling on our knees up hundreds of steps in order to be absolved of our sins and we want to think about what patient means in a more practical way way and if you misunderstand patients and you think it means means to suffer then no wonder so many men just threw themselves on a bed of nettles and into thorns and just caused themselves to experience physical pain because they thought this is what brings perfection and that's not it patience leads to rewards now patience is an intrinsic character of God it is something we could say God is patience I think I have a prompt there on the slides patience is an essential characteristic of God it is an attribute of God and an essential attribute for the believer something that The Believer by birth if you're born again today patience is in you right that that we could just say it's a virtue that is in that Soul it is a part of that it's one of the fruits of the spirit and so now what we want is that to be placed right we want it to come to the Forefront we wanted to work out in the manifestation of the Statue of a perfect man and so patience is essential to the nature of God it is part of his inherent nature and the Bible says in second Peter chapter 3 verse 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some meant count slackness but his long-suffering this is that that where they get long suffering it's almost a direct translation of long and suffering uh to us word not willing that they should should perish but that all should come to repentance there's a number of scriptures I wanted to use but God is patient this is what God is God is patient I mean he says he's not slack his patience is not the result of him being dull his patience is not the result of him being inactive he says God is Not slack how men count slackness in other words God's not slow to appreciate what is happening and that's why he doesn't act right some of us are just dull I was like man he has so much patience he just waited to the very end to grab that he just waited the last minute to do something you notice how he held on to that investment to the last minute and finally sold it's like I couldn't remember my password right there's things people give you credit for being patient or someone just slack and you're lazy and you're lazy and you're lazy you don't do it that's not patience don't confuse laziness for patience I said that's not how God is God can fully appreciate the situation and he's not quick to judge it he's not quick to intervene he's not quick to do something but God knows what is happening so I want to say this his wisdom is manifested in his waiting his wisdom is manifested in him being a little bit hands off his wisdom is manifested in his patience so God is patient and it's through his patience that his wisdom is made manifest God says this in Exodus 34 6 of himself and the Lord passed by before him verse 5 is a doozy you should read that one and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious I don't even know what doozy means really but what I mean is it's awesome it's Wonderful Merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and Truth this is what he says himself the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant and goodness and Truth merciful and gracious abundant goodness and truth and the meat is long-suffering where would his mercy and graciousness and his abundance and goodness and Truth be unless it could last unless it was long-lasting long-suffering Peter even says it this way in second Peter 3 5 he's just jumping 3 15. after he said that God is long-suffering towards us and not slack he says an account that the long suffering of Our Lord is salvation his patience is what gives us the opportunity that that had God not been patient patient there's no salvation so it it says in such a way that you would almost say uh a equals b equals c so a equals c but he says in the account of the long suffering of the Lord is salvation it's put in his equals but it's his patience that allows for salvation and makes an opportunity for salvation look at First Corinthians chapter 13 I have Verses 4 and 7 here this is the beginning of the descriptions of Charity charity suffereth long and then in verse 7 endureth all things these the the patience is the beginning of love and the end of love because it says in the next verse charity never faileth it's it's just summarizing all these characteristics of Charity Charities suffereth long that's the one word used of patience that's translated that macrothumas and then it says and endureth all things it uses both words that are used in the New Testament for patience it uses it when describing love and patience then is the bookends of love it's forming the boundaries of Charity's character that whatever other essential attributes it might have that it's kind and Envy's not it vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up it Bears all things believes all things hopes all things and it's only able to Barrel things believe all things and hope all things because it's endurance it's endurance it's faith can allow it to its patients can allow it to Bear it can allow it to believe it can allow it to hope it can allow it to be kind and not be jealous in other words it doesn't run out it's such a beautiful picture about love charity suffereth long charity endureth all things this patience is just God is love God is this charity and notice it's bookings it's clothings it's boundaries to say it is patient and love is patient and it is kind and so patience is essential and I think it was at this in my notes I think I had um several several scriptures I wanted to use just to show the repetition and how that the importance of patience is highlighted by its emphasis and if you're Bible readers which I hope you are it would be hard not to read your Bible this week and not come across this principle of patience it's in so many different places and so I want you to recognize its importance as we're talking about it being an essential to the nature of God and to the Christian notice its emphasis how often it's emphasized in Scripture and how the purpose of suffering in patience is to bring us to Perfection to full maturity and full reward so James deals with it this way in James chapter 5 verses 7 and 8. or actually we'll go I will go to verse I don't maybe hopefully I have the slides or we'll go to verse 11. it says be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord so there's your patience behold the husbandman now the principal be patient until that day that we meet him in the air he says this is the principle he uses to encourage this patience behold the husbandman the one that looks after a Vineyard that watches after a garden waited for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it till he receive the early and latter rain looking at the process of one who cultivates the ground and sows seed and has to wait until the Harvest even after the rains are given in order to receive the precious fruit so be patient until the day that you'll meet the Lord in the air and receive your reward he says just as a husband waits for precious fruit of the Earth have long patience verse 8 be ye also patient establish your hearts that means strengthen and fix your hearts render it constantly and and and have it to be firm and fixed be patient fix your hearts let your heart be fixed and I want you to recognize how it's patience that causes our hearts to be firm and our hearts to be stable be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of Lord drawth nigh Grudge not one against another Brethren lest ye be condemned at that day behold the judge standeth before the door taken I know that we Amplified this together already in Rewards take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure that word their endure is also translated to patience and it's used patience in the next phrase you have heard of the patience of Job we count them happy which have patience you have heard of the endurance of job could have easily been translated that way it's the same word and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy so we're wanting to pay close attention to the relationship between patience and suffering and how that patience leads to reward and how this is a characteristic that Paul says we ought to admire in the prophets count them happy which have it you want to be patient just as the husbandman is patient and he works and labors with the field and the toil and this patience which allows him to toil is ultimately rewarded so if I could say this way and maybe this is putting in crude terms patience is a god-given ability to endure to the payoff it's the power to stick to something this is establish Arts fix your hearts on something yeah set it Go and stick to it yeah that you're looking out on Tien brother bam says if we just live for today we'd be miserable but live out to the end look out to the end so there's something that we fixed our hearts on this there's a prize that we stand to obtain we're keeping our eyes on the prize we're not looking down at everything around us and we keep rising and my heart's fixed to that and so patience is the powers to stick to something and to not vary from it notice how Jesus says in Luke chapter 8 verse 15 this is where we see the repeated emphasis but that on the good ground the word is the seed the word that fell on good ground he says they on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience that's the only way that it can bring forth fruit in other words the word that went into the ground it's not boom right it's not the Sea Falls boom fruit comes up it's like I did it I made it yay right it explains the process of how that first the seed in the on the on the hard ground it came on the Wayside in the hard ground it can't ever go through the process of getting Roots down deep and getting the light and the nurture nutrients something comes and gets it and snatches it or works against it even in the good ground that has other things in it it impedes the process it becomes a hindrance to patients cares of Life interrupt choke out impede the progress of the seed and he's saying they that are in good ground hear the word keep it and with patience bring forth fruit the fruit doesn't come overnight it's a process that takes time that's what James is referring to James Chapter Five have patience just like a husbandman Waits because this is a process second Timothy Chapter 2 verses 9 10 11 and 12 wherefore I suffer trouble as an evildoer even under bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I endure endure there's patience all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Jesus Christ with eternal glory so Paul has rewards in mind when he speaks of patience it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him and the believer cut themselves and the Believers sold all their possessions and walked to church in in Birkenstocks that they got at the Salvation Army and and get got rid of all their things and took to themselves some Monk or some uh Catholic priest and they're just going to live in in poverty in this suffer and suffer that's what it means if we suffer we'll Reign uh anybody want to guess what that word suffer there is translated to patience all throughout the New Testament it's the same word used of the character of one who does not swerve from their deliberate purpose it's the same word that's used of Charity that it endureth all things it's the same word referring to patients of job it's the same word that's used about Happy with which those that endure it's the same word that's used of Jesus who endured the cross it's the same word users let us run with patience it says here is the patience and the faith of the Saints you have need of patience and faith worketh patience and patience have a perfect work it's the same word if we suffer means if we have patience you know what you guys should be doing speaking in tongues you mean I don't have to bleed I don't have to cry I don't have to be in pain I don't have to be poor amen you should be getting crazy excited about it thinking that suffering doesn't mean I have to break my leg I have to lose an arm I have to go bankrupt I have to lose my family well you may have to but it's certainly not saying that the suffering is merely physical pain broken hearts the loss of blood and the loss of life and the loss of everything we love now God may call you to a suffering like he did job he may call you to death like he did Paul but he does it all with the purpose and as we might have the extremes of suffering and death and suffering but and the extremes of patient being patient we must realize that there must be a more simple daily application of this lest we forget to fully lean into and accept God's process I were waiting around for suffering for our Perfection when he's putting up before us if we're patient we shall also reign with him you know what rain means possess supremely to possess Supreme Liberty honor and blessedness to Reign means possess if we suffer we'll possess if we're patient we'll possess suffering here is simply be impatient waiting on God and waiting for God in other words it's daily opportunities it's something that we can do daily and we don't have to seek for heartache we don't have to work up conflict it comes on its own it'll be here this summer you better believe it better get that airlock in it says if we suffer if we're patient I don't know if you realize every day you have a hundred opportunities at least to be patient why haven't they fixed this why didn't they do that why is it this way what about this what about that you have so many opportunities to belong right to endure to put up with to wait to not be judging daily opportunities and so let me try to turn a little bit of a corner here I've made it a habit to no longer look at the clock I don't know if it's a good habit or a bad habit but what I want you to recognize in this is that God has ordained that things of value come at a price uh that's why any more if I'm shopping for something on Amazon I do two things I rank by price and I look for the most expensive one and then I use those websites that check for fake reviews and now I think we need a website that checks websites that check for fake reviews uh and so you look for something that's expensive because in your mind you're thinking that's where the value is if the market establishes a high price it may be related to Quality it may be related to Value don't just adopt that as a policy that's just me talking Off Script here about my Amazon habits but it's true that it's things of value come at a price part of our human psychology even that they they've tested this on a number of levels that if you have something that you've created just there's a certain way to attach value to it and you assess uh and it creates attachments to it and that's yours and this is how much it's worth or this is yours and keep it for so long this is yours and you can keep it here and they found that people who had possession of something or who people who paid more for it there were certain ways that people assessed and attached a greater worth an effort into certain things but God is saying and as we look at this if we have patience we'll possess God there's things if something has value if something has power then it has to come with the price and maybe I'm just failing to use the right words there and I apologize but if we know that power without character satanic so we understand that principle if you have power without character it's it's unfit to rule it's unfit to possess it's it's on you it's not the right use of opportunity and Power and we find that character cannot come without patience without suffering and so it's that process of suffering in this process of patience that causes us to be fit to rules the process of character development and so since power is so precious and since power is so powerful it says I'm losing my vocabulary but since power is what it is and it has and it carries with it uh the ability to change things and to judge and I just I want you to bring in the whole scope of power and authority because it is what it is God does not allow that to be easily attained to honor without suffering gain without enduring is dangerous this is where I'm moving into a little bit different area now that if you get honor without suffering and you get praise or you get gained you you receive reward without enduring or patience it's dangerous because of our Humanity because we're humans and if I could say this we need patience we need perseverance we need that we need to preserve we need to persevere we need persistence because it's part of God's process for us as his children and it's part and the way that I want to make this relevant if you could turn to Second Corinthians chapter four it's necessary for in order for us to experience his Wonder if we're going to know him in a in a greater measure continually we need patience if you knew that you could just look over a fence and see God anytime you wanted how often would you look over the fence that was just the example that came to my mind but I think that it's When Things become so available to us and so common say oh great you know look what I got look what I got oh you can get those anywhere like really I've only ever seen them at my store one time yeah they're everywhere everywhere and it loses its value when it's everywhere when it's just so easy to see and so easy to experience second Corinthians chapter four this is where our text was and he's talking about the glory of God abounding for which cause the glory of God being abounded and praise being given for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the n-word man is renewed day by day the outward man would be the human part mind the the body and the spirit but though our in our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment but for now notice what Paul idea Paul is drilling into it's just so amazing how Paul could be so contextual based upon who he was talking to and there may be some people who hear me preach and they might be like oh that's not for me and and I realize if I felt that way I'd be the most depressed preacher in the world right because we've got room right you'll be like man not everybody's here today why wasn't there six million lining up and down the 101 to get in here today but you realize it's the way that God would deal with the man it's contextual to his audience and that's why sometimes you may stream a preacher like not my cup of tea ain't your cup of tea is right was a serving that to you it's contextual to the audience and Paul is just so amazing to draw on the classics and draw from philosophers and draw from things that would be relevant to the Corinthians and he says our light Affliction is just for now what we're going through now but it's working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory so what we're going through now and we may suffer now we're having to be patient now and we're not seeing the benefits and the relief and the full blessing now but we will one day is what he's saying it works a far more exceeding Eternal way to Glory while we look not on the things which are seen which with outward man is so connected to but the things which are not seen which the inward man is drawing from for the things which are seen are temporal which is what the outward man wants but the things which are not seen are Eternal which is what the inward man is searching for looking for so now as we get into the after hour how many are familiar with the concept of delayed gratification very very large and Rich body of study and thought and a proven principle on a number of different layers but that's exactly what Paul's preaching I could show you in so many different areas in scripture walking out after the flesh walk after the spirit that you not fulfill the Deeds of the the scripture is constantly enforcing the principle of delaying gratification and that's what Paul's talking about here what we're suffering now is but for a moment we're delaying gratification because we know that it's working for a much greater reward delayed gratification is the act of resisting and impulse to take an immediately available reward in the hope of obtaining a more value valuable reward in the future catch that delayed gratification is the act of resisting the desire to satisfy to receive an immediately available reward in the hope of getting something greater later on like I'm going to forego a return now being long you may have to bleed out right until my day trading you might have to suffer daily pay but if you but you're hoping for that time there might be some certain things I'm waiting for the payoff I'm waiting for the path I guess it works and being short too but it's the act of holding off hold it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna dip now I'm not gonna take it now I'm not gonna do it now I'm gonna resist I'm gonna delay gratification knowing that something greater comes later we used it last Sunday in Hebrews chapter 11 verses 24 to 26 Moses patiently endured by refusing the present Pleasures in light of the future game delayed gratification is what Moses did he says you know what I could give in now and become take advantage of all my opportunities as a son of Pharaoh's daughter that I could get it now and I could gratify myself now according to the outward man but he delayed receiving glory honor and Prestige for the future honor that would come through Christ it was delayed gratification we just read it in Hebrews 12 Christ patiently endured by refusing present Pleasures for future gain he even in the Temptation the Wilderness was offered all the kingdoms without suffering without death and he said I will delay the glory I will delay the honor because the future Glory and Honor will be much more precious if I receive it through suffering you catch on the principle that I've been building to I hope it's starting to make a lot of sense they resisted temptation of the immediate pleasure in the hopes obtaining a future lasting more lasting Eternal reward and so as we mentioned already patience involves the regulation of emotions to where we're not quick to indulge in the desire for something we're not quick to want to get immediate return in other words the outward man perishes every day why because Paul wasn't simply interested in making sure that guy was always sensitized he's letting it die a little bit the flesh was bored he's like you should be bored he said he beat it he brought it under subjection he treated he treated it roughly because he didn't want it to rule him this is a critically important principle the ability to delay gratification is essential to self-control it's essential to perfection and so God has created us to experience rewards after effort God will not reward us unless there's been effort God will not pay us unless there's been labor he's created this in such a way the concept of rewards not the gift but God has created the experience in his own in his word and his promises that he rewards us after effort after discipline after striving after applying ourselves that's how man is let me go quickly Ecclesiastes 3 22. wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better then that a man shall rejoice in his own works for that is his portion this says in Ecclesiastes 2 4 that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor this is God's design for Humanity this is the preacher who observed everything under the earth and the one thing that he could observe that was true that there was nothing better than that labor precede rewards he didn't say there's nothing better than for a man to win the lottery it's nothing better for a man than to steal the crops from his neighbor's plot he said there's nothing in that that's vanity it's vanity to get fruit without labor it's vanity to eat without working it's vanity to receive a portion unless you've strove for it he's saying that God designed for Humanity labor comes before Rewards said this to Adam when he thrust him from the garden from the sweat of thy brow you'll eat bread I know there's a way that we looked at as a curse upon the ground but Adam himself was not cursed it was telling Adam that if you sweat you'll earn a reward if you work and you labor you'll get the fruit you need you'll get your daily bread in other words he was telling man this is how I made you in the beginning I made you to till the ground so awaken something inside of you that'll satisfy you as a man if a man Works he's worthy of eating if a man labors he deserves the fruit and there's nothing better for man to work to strive and then enjoy the fruits of that labor it's part of the design God's in sin of God's reward for the believer comes after Labor in the end this is the way God's designed it and God designed it that way because it provides for the necessary development of the person and the proper motivation to the end Ecclesiastes 7 8 better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit better to be patient than arrogant better to boast of all the uh temporary benefits and Pleasures you have now it better not to do that better to be patient than to boast oh look what I got look at this look at that I remember I remember one time right when we moved I remember we moved to Phoenix years ago and uh and everybody was bragging about how much their houses were and how little they paid for it and like we're moving in at a time when it's like yeah I bought my house for 200 000 it's worth 800 000 now and one percent I bought it for 375 it's worth 7.50 it's like you should get in on this I said anymore you think it's going to go to 1.5 million hey like I think maybe I'm in the wrong time and before we left people their houses were worth less than what they'd paid for it 15 years before better be patient right better to be patient than arrogant at saying better is the end of the thing than the beginning thereof God unfolds this truth in creation the principle want you to catch us the pr the design of God the principle of patience God is the all-powerful all-knowing he could do whatever he wants and as the as the hippies often uh conjectured can God is God's so great that he could create a rock so heavy that even he can't lift it right and they engage in these these weird debates but God could have if he wanted to just spoke and everything come into being he didn't do that start small God works six days to make creation then he rests what's the principle that God is looking at that the point at which rest is appropriate that God worked and labored and saw that it was good that this is God's design this process unfolds that he unfolds this truth in creation it was a process he unfolds this truth still yet in nature the law of conception the law of gestation the long of late the law of Labor all these things things show that things with life things with value take time and the process is just as important as the product and that patience is a necessary part of perfection this is important and if it gets lost somehow in the length of this list of this and the denseness of it uh I I'm I'm happy being able to get it out because I think it needs to be said and if you're if you're getting a little bit weary be patient just stick with this if that's God's process and and I know we're covering a lot of ground and I'm making a just a very direct point if this is God's process what's the price if we bypass it if God himself would take six days to create creation then take a rest before he enjoys it essentially then how much is it uh then how important is the process what if if God wants gain to come after Labor if there's nothing better from ending to work and work and then enjoy the fruits of it if God has ordained that the it's bet the end is better than the beginning it's better to be patient than to be arrogant if all these things point to Faith in patients working together and that it's that there's something to where man has to be deliberate and to be pressing what happens if God's process is otherwise manipulated and we try to get the reward before the labor we try to get the payoff without the patients are you with me I'm just looking for some eye contact some nodding uh you don't offend me if you fall asleep it's part of human nature it happens and I know that we we uh have long hours we got a lot of Demands and I'm I'm very empathetic uh when it when it comes to to sleeping in church because I did it for the first 12 or 13 years of my life now it may be 17 or 18 too I hope you can just uh just ready yourself because this is the this is the real thrust now if things come too easily it short circuits God's plan if things come too easily it it interrupts God's process because of the way that he's made us think about how God works in nature think about Jesus think about Moses think about all these things do I need to go back over what I've just preached because now this is momentum building this is all built hopefully it's just accumulated Community including if you could get something too easily right power apart from character satanic if you get power too quickly it's not fit doesn't work so in Proverbs chapter 20 verse 21 an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed in other words if it comes too easy without hard work it's wasted right if you're given something too soon then this quick wealth is not blessed in the end if a father has an inheritance and he gives it to you too quickly it's wasted just as quick an inheritance may be gotten quick but if it doesn't follow the process of character development if it's not following the law of God's adoption the end is not blessed these are the rules by which men govern themselves when it came to raising their children it may be theirs but if I give it to them too quickly the waste it Proverbs chapter 28 verses 20 then 22 a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent trying to get rich without patience is what it's saying but he says he that hastes to be rich shall not be uh shall not be innocent saying the faithful faithful man shall abound with blessing the one that wants to do right and do it the right way will be blessed but he that wants to get rich quick will fail he hasted verse 22 he hasted to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him he's pervert he has a perverted understanding not realize if he gets things too easily he doesn't know how to hold on to it if he gets things too easily he can lose it just the same it's such a beautiful principle that's presenting the the notion and the truth that if things come too quickly or too easily then we haven't honored God's process and we haven't really gained it says if we're patient we'll possess if you get it too quickly it's just temporary it's really not in your possession if you try to get rich without patience without the testing the trial the suffering to do it to get rich without the testing the trial and the suffering is saying is evil and leads to the loss of it you may get it but you won't hold on to it so God ordains the pressure God ordains the resistance God ordains the suffering God ordains the delayed gratification for a purpose Romans chapter 5 verses 3 to 5 and not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience you know what experience there is there Greek for proven character tribulation you know what tribulation means yeah it means burning I mean it means bleeding it means pressure stress actually word if you look up distress stress tribulation is pressure oppression or distress this is God's ordained process it's even the way he's ordained for a baby to come forth stress pressure it activates certain things in the immune system it's healthy for the baby to come that way the Natural Way says and tribulation Works patience tribulation gives patients a job to do right and patience experience or proven character and proven character hope which means for good the ACT hope there's the expectation of good it's the process of character development and being rewarded for good character summed up in one sentence a patience experience experience hope and hope make it not a shame the expectation of good maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us in other words we know that he loves us and we're not ashamed because his love is shed abroad in our hearts we're confident in his love so we can engage in this process of pressure stress tribulation because it's going to give patients a job to do and if patience has a job her job is what a perfect work and so I need pressure I need stress I need opposition to be working against me in order to give patients a job because if she doesn't have a job she can't do a perfect work and if she gets she has enough stress enough pressure her job will be working to make me perfect an entire wanting nothing so God uses the combination of pressure or stress and rewards to motivate our behavior and regulate our emotions behavioral economics and sociologists and psychologists and all the latest uh within the realm of psychology has not discovered this the Bible's been telling us this from the beginning that God is using pressure and stress and the and the receiving of a reward to motivate our behavior and to regulate our behavior and our emotions because Paul says but if we hope for that which we see not if we have the expectation of good and if we don't see it then we do with patience wait for it partaking in the good that you expect after you've endured and patiently waited for it is glorious it's a glorious Delight it is it's euphoric it's exciting it's enthusing and so patience I'm running out of time I just need to be patient I just have to fit I have to finish this if I'm still just growing as a pastor in the length of these things you uh be patient with me as I grow patience we we recognize that patience is a conscious Act that were put into a situation and therefore Paul is saying be patient be patient be patient and so there's a way that we can look at patients that is this deliberate conscious Act of the individual to endure but patience is also part of an unconscious brain process in the human and I think there's a spiritual type here but even in the spiritual type it's working off of the way God has made us that in the human brain let me show that slide I think I have a slide that just shows the human brain they're they're circuits that run through it and there's actually called the reward center of the brain a reward circuitry in the brain and so there's this circuit that runs to the prefrontal cortex there there there's and what's being demonstrated here is maybe just crude drawing of it what I want you to think about is this neural network this circuit runs through your brain and it acts as it monitors the the brain's Reward Center and it acts like a switch now I hope you could stay with me please don't let death die on a chair today that this brain this is the way God is everything's built up to this idea of patience now and this is the process and the the physical way that God has designed us there's a switch in our brain and this is just an overview if the Lord leads maybe we'll get into a little bit more details later so there's a switch in your brain that's monitoring Rewards and the way that that switch works and I'm just using very crude language to try to describe it to you in a way that's not technical if you want it technical we'll have the doctors brother Andrew Brother Scott we'll have the doctors explain it to you and what this switch does is when there's no immediate reward and this is the direct link switch prompts the brain to be patient a reward is coming there's a part of our brain that wants to get something wants to be stimulated wants to be excited and when it doesn't see it there's a part that says hold on buddy it's coming it's called patience it's a trigger it's a brain function that's there that keeps reminding your desire to have something to have excitement to have a frill thrill to be rewarded keep saying you don't need the reward now it's coming so patience Works to tell the reward that the reward part of the brain the pleasure sent to the brain don't worry it's coming and when the reward comes it comes in the form of dopamine it's the chemical reward for success and so the way that this and the reason why the way dopamine works the reason why you get such an excitement out of certain things is it's the complementary systems of stress adrenaline and Rewards the dopamine that produce your excitement that produce your Wonder that produce the feeling of satisfaction but this is where you might be thinking man you're out in the weeds brother Aaron you're out in the weeds but the right balance is necessary there must be patience that that part of the brain that says hold on hold on a reward is coming that has to be working there has to be perseverance there has to be stress meditate on this I want you to think about this use your that even just use that to ponder this patience is only built and patience is only will only work through intermittent reinforcement like a patient has a perfect work then you you have to have stress you have to have tribulation in order for patients to be working so in order for patients to have a job you can't always be rewarded this makes a lot of sense to the guy who's standing up with the balcony behind the future balcony behind them makes a lot of sense to me and I and I I want to make this very very clear so I'm not afraid to labor on it and until I kind of get the feedback that it's clear and the front row said hey man we get it but patience is only Built it's only working through intermittent reinforcement not constant stimulation if patience if we get rid of patients and the reward centers right patience is out of the picture don't have anything to do with it if we get rewards too often or too frequently then we quit when rewards aren't present if we get excited if we get happy if we get thrilled if we get the endorphin rush if we get the dopamine if we get that too often then we get begin to lose patience when we don't get rewarded soon enough is it starting to click the death of patience it's exactly where we are the death of patience has resulted in the wonderlust and the Wonder lost why because the world has reversed engine reverse engineered God's process that God has designed for our Perfection and his purpose it's the death of patience that's resulted in that aimless wondering if the death of patience that resulted in the Lost Wonder of Christ because the world has recognized the way that we are wired and the way that we work and they've engineered a process for us to experience gain without suffering and daily we're provided with the feelings of success and rewards without any real patience without any really real effort without any real development and many of our information and communication Technologies to use a technical term ICT that's your cell phones your tablets your computers it's your MP3 players anything that's going to use for information conveying information or communication they manipulate our minds many of our systems of this give us the magical effect of achieving something the magical effect of overcoming all by bypassing real patients and they've created the illusion now that you've gained something through some effort it's completely empty you can log on to Clash of Clans you could log on to Minecraft you can and find that someone's hacked you and stolen all of it all everything can be gone in a moment and say well how do I get it back you don't the server failed I had my whole life on that well it's gone now these systems have created the magical literal physiological feeling of success by bypassing the natural process our games our programs our social media interactions are all increased this dopamine give us an increase of dopamine and adrenaline in our brains right whenever there's a buzz whenever you get a notification let me say this to the 50-somethings when you heard you got mail what happened right whoa right and you went to find out to who's it from AOL wants me to renew I am but it created tension it created some stress at one point right that's the whole sound of the modem for those who had Prodigy what did it do it created this Pavlov's dog you hear that honey it's connecting to the web you were conditioned you knew something new was coming it's the way these all of these things create this to check your WhatsApp status to see how many have viewed it to look for notifications emails all these things to open up games to check the brackets all these things and and and running all the it's even the very thing that creates why Sports is so uh gets such a lock on people because it has the right balance between stress and Rewards unless you're a Browns fans it's just always stress but this is I brother Mitch if you could show this statement this is what they conclude your brain chemistry is just being fooled into thinking you're accomplishing something foreign I just put it as a quote just to say it exactly the way the author wrote it you're being fooled into thinking you're accomplishing something so your brain gives you a dopamine rush and you get the sense of satisfaction praise honor glory I've accomplished something isn't that great I I am now on level 12 and I am now I have now accomplished this and I've been able to line all these colors up and I've been able to do this and I've been able to do that and and we make sure that we accumulate and we keep the score going and I've done this and I've done that I'm a genius in spelling bee and I'm I'm able to get the the world done in three tries every time and you get this feeling of oh my goodness Graces killing it today what have you done did you close a major merger and acquisition did you pass some sort of certification no I passed a level and you know you know I finally won in Smash Bros or whatever it is I finally learned how to download fortnite on my phone there's there's things that we consider great and why do we feel that way we feel it can I get a witness and all the while patience is dying the world is destroying patience and with the death of patients impatience is born how because now you can do things a thousand times a day that give you the immediate dopamine Rush if you don't like the video you're watching don't worry it's going to end it's just a tick tock right YouTube's going to be overrun with shorts right where everything's just short little Snippets sound bites you don't have enough time to listen to a podcast you just need the sound bites right there's that's the way we're getting everything's in short everything's quick if you don't and we have enough at our disposal now but if you're watching listing or trying to read something if it doesn't get your attention and you don't get that stress and that tension working and you don't get that reward coming you just move on to the next one and what's happening our attention spans are shrinking our capacity to focus is wasting away we don't have the we don't have the patience to endure we don't have the patience to press how appropriate that I'm preaching an hour and a half this morning why because what's happening is all of our press and all of our patients is just dwelling our attention span is dwindling I wanted to use a title called chasing the dragon I wanted to allude to not the way that some would do heroin but actually allude to the the thing that the way that people get enamored with the high and the reason why they keep doing the things that they're doing is they're trying to recapture the magic they want to have that experience they want to have that feeling and you felt it through some sort of interaction or engagement one of these processes has created this dopamine effect and you're you're looking you're chasing that high you're chasing that stimulation and you're pursuing a reward but the reward is empty it's vanity because what happens and I'm talking about very very practical things in our lives whether it's your cell phone whether your tablet whether the gaming system you use whether it's the systems you're using whether it be on Pinterest or social media whatever it may be there's some gamification to it and there's some way that some Mark Zuckerberg somewhere has realized that you're the commodity and if they could just get you in that cycle of ping reward status recognition honor elevation points or whatever it'll get you in an addiction it is an addiction where now you get a dopamine rush and your dopamine gets you searching and you're searching gets you the dopamine and it puts you down the path to where now you just begin to chase more and to chase more and Chase more and then it becomes difficult becomes an addiction becomes absent-minded you could tell someone hey can you catch can you give me so-and-so's phone number and they'll grab their phone and without even thinking about it they've opened up some other app and check so many other things and they're like are you going to get that number for me like oh oh yeah and you think how do you know this brother Aaron discernment somebody's standing here right now with The Gingham tie on who's done this before and I'm talking to you You Know Who You Are see him with The Gingham tie getting ready for church so you say well how is this relevant how is this relevant I want to bring it down to home now with the death of patience our desire for Christ and our motivation for Christ is dying because our minds are being conditioned for cheap Rewards our body our mind we're craving it's an addiction we're in the cycle and we become we're we're being conditioned for substitute rewards the the dopamine Rush of a text right a like or a follow a new achievement unlocked in games and we and we have and we have all these substitute cheap rewards and they come so easy and now we're applying ourselves to all these empty Pursuits instead of The Wonder of Christ and the Bible says in Philippians 2 5 and 6 let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God God likeness is not something easily grasped thought it not Robert to be equal with God not only does it carry the context that it was he had equality a God against which there was no law but it also means it's not something easily grasp or acquired you can't just grab perfection you can't just and listen if you think if you think that you're actually achieving the things that you achieved with these games and these things that have been developed it's intentionally done a certain way to create a certain balance between stress and reward they want you to fail so many times but they also need you to succeed enough times so that you keep coming back and you think you're actually good at that game and you're the one being played and and there may not be anybody in this church that plays games I don't know so apply it to whatever is applicable but we get it's when we are too easily when it's too easy to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season when it's just too accessible and too easy to get the dopamine Rush from our devices from the programs from the shows from the podcast from the books from all these other things that we like to digest when it just becomes that too easy to enjoy the pleasures of the Mind then it's harder to patiently endure and in fact it says you can only know Christ through patience you can only known through enduring in Genesis chapter 15 verse 1 it says to Abraham after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward after what things you know what happened in verse 14 he fought against Kings he went after and saved his nephew lot and he restores him he's fighting to rescue lot and then just immediately before this chapter turns it turns to the next chapter He Turned Down The Spoils of Sodom he thought he'd labored and and he had fought things out and he had an opportunity he saw him say Hey you could keep this you can have this he says I don't want anything from your hand he turned it all down and after he turns down these spoils after he spot and after he's labored God says I am thy covering and I am thy exceeding great reward it was only after the battle that communion was served it was only after the fight it was only after resisting it was only after enduring that God could actually be the reward and we Christ has lost his Wonder because we want him to come as easy as everything else does in this life you don't even have to be a chef and you can cook four-star meals just order it in a box it'll show up it'll tell you how to cook it how to do it and it's perfect you don't you you don't have to be you don't have to have an expensive smoker anymore and know all the science of smoking and the Mildred reaction and everything all you need is just buy the right Machine push the red button put the meat on perfectly smoked brisket all right write that down somebody I know the channel next time right that's exactly how easy it is anymore and even things that we enjoy now get it comes so easy but Christ is not that way it says of Abraham in Hebrews 6 5 and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise let me say Christ is still our reward I'm closing with this Christ is still our reward but our minds are being hijacked our brains are being hacked and we've got this outward man that's not perishing the outward man's not perishing enough it's being kept Alive by all the adrenaline and dopamine and meanwhile The Wonder of Christ is being lost and in order to restore The Wonder of Christ you have to recognize the influences that have tilted the scales because I promise you it's not a matter of trying to keep this outward man fully vitalized and then somehow have a healthy spiritual man and I just want to dip in and out that's the danger of how that we've redefined religion religion is a part of a person's life whereas when Paul talked about the gospel it was their life to a Jew it was their life their religion was their life their something they revered in reverence there was something they were in all this God who manifested himself and gave him these precious promises so there was much the temple itself was a representation of Heaven on Earth everything to them was so literal and so real it's got to be the same way for us as a gentile bride he has to become the invisible has to become more real to us and more wonderful to us than everything the outward man sees and feeds on and enjoys and the only way we're going to reawaken The Wonder of Christ is to cause the outward man to perish and recognize the influences that are keeping our brain in this dopamine-induced Loop and the cycles of addiction that we're all feeding into that have caused us to forget just how wonderful Christ is brother Randall I believe it's in Christ as the mystery God revealed he says why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you Christ is wanting to reveal to you him his wonder and it's there the appetites there the desires there the inward man is built and designed to experience that and it's going to take patience to see his glory it's going to take patience to see it but we get caught in the Cheap Thrills they come too quickly they come too easily oh God help us I say that if the if the majority of you have not entered into that let me say it as a proclamation to defend against it ever happening and to protect our children's Hearts from it my how we should be so respectful of how easily the world can begin to train our young children's Minds brother bam said rock and roll rock and roll music will catch their attention that quick that was with the record that might be playing on a jukebox in a restaurant now what does the world do with all the devices that are available behind a closed door in Revelations chapter 2 verses one to five I'll close this because this will be a good you say brother Aaron why are you closing I'm running out of notes I could go to the next one but this is all I have slides for but I want to read this because I think it'll provide a nice touch point for the next service maybe we'll pick up on some of these things on Sunday unto the angel the Church of Ephesus right these things saith the he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand now keep in mind the end of laodicea crisis on the outside knocking what is he wanting to do awaken you to the Wonder that's what he wants he wants you to come into fellowship with him he walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and this is what he says I know that works and thy labor and thy patience how that cannot bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they're Apostles and are not and has found them Liars and it's born and has patience it comes later to the thyterian age and gives them a similar comment of the compliment of their patients he comes to Philadelphia compliments them on their patients patients has born and has patience and for my namesake has labor and has not fainted nevertheless I have someone against thee because thou has left thy first love it was the dying of patience so he says remember therefore from wince Thou Art fallen from what the works the labor and the patience from the bearing and the patience remember therefore from one start following and repent and do the first works or else I'll come to unto thee quickly remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent without the patience there's no reward what did the death the patients result in the cooling off of their love and as love waned so did The Wonder of Christ that's what I want us to be awakened to that's what I want us looking for every day I want us to be living for that I want us to do it as a church I want us to do it in our families I want us to do it as individuals that I want to be less enthused and enamored with the things of this world and More in Wonder of Christ that's what I want Brothers if he could come to your instruments brother Branham writes this about this very word verse in the scripture he says who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are those words when viewed in light of the scripture which describes him as Christ who's in who is our life for Christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life right now catch this on the death of patience watch how he says this without him she's simply religious Society a club a meaningless gather of the Gathering of the people a corpse Bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also and what this is the next phrase before we get to it I want you to look at this without Christ in us we're just a corpse without the Wonder of Christ alive with that Vitality we're just corpse with the death of patience comes the death of of Wonder for Christ we just become Corpses no matter what kind of club we have no matter what kind of gatherings no matter how Bejeweled and dressed we might be you're still just a corpse no matter how many rewards you can gain and how much dopamine and adrenaline you experience on a daily basis no matter how much you may feel that you're blessed if Christ isn't your life you're still just a corpse but then he says but with or him intermitted with him motivating her that calls right back to God's process of character development it goes right back to God's way of patience and incentives and you hold out an incentive this is God's way with him and her midst with him motivating her she becomes the wonderment of all is it that we become the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all when he becomes the wonderment to us when he becomes our wonder when he becomes our life when it's him that is in US motivating us when he becomes our motivation when we allow him to find the right balance of tribulation and re-blessings and the right balance of pressure and rewards the right blessing of stress and honor and and pressure in Praise let God find the right balance in our lives then we'll find that he is a Wonder and then we can become the wonderment of all Christ is still our Wonder and I hope that you can see it in a picture today that there is a death of patience and it has happened in a society that knows that we're looking for a a a chemical the reward in our brains we're looking for it and we're experiencing it in every single phase of life we're experiencing it without patience without patience and because of that whenever we do in have to endure we quit way too easily because we haven't learned to wait for it we haven't learned to wait haven't learned to wait haven't learned to wait and patience is waiting on God and waiting for God and perfection in his patience I pray that God would help us help us to to keep patients alive and awaken the Wonder of Christ in our lives
