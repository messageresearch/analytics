TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yeah we'll go ahead and read it all the way to verse 11 I think I might stop a little short I have it till verse 11 I may stop a little short of that in those days was Hezekiah sick un death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and said unto him thus sayith the Lord set thy house in order for Thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came to him saying turn again and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people thus sayith the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer and I've seen thy tears behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord It's God that's going to heal him and I will add unto thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake now remember God said he's going to heal them verse 7 and Isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered we'll just stop there they took figs laid it on the boil and he recovered you can take your seats I think I was going to be reading in a few other places to tie those other verses in but we'll just we'll leave it there my title tonight is a miracle or medicine it's a question a miracle or medicine and it's a continuation brother Chris if you have that title slide it's a continuation on a matter of faith and uh this is I realize and now it's kind of eth service on this I I feel like there's a burden that I've been chasing in this subject and some things have just been building on this this would really fit under the subject of Divine Healing this is really going to tie in a lot to what we ministered on Sunday though we won't background anything but I'm asking the question tonight a miracle or medicine and as this title is posed as a question really going to address in some ways whether it is an act of unbelief or manifestation of unbelief to use means in healing or to pursue methods or to look for things to be healed or to be cured and we could maybe put it this way if I'm sick does faith do nothing at all when I find myself ailing and I find something's wrong does faith say NOP I believe God's going to heal me and does nothing at all or does it try and I think I may even mentioned this before does it try everything that is available as a as a an affirmative act to believe I I want to be well and I want to be healed and in James chapter 5: 13-6 we've been reading this so much we don't have the provide the slide here but says if any are afflicted we've been looking at how that's in mind it tells them to pray if anyone is not happy let them sing Psalms and then it says is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick now this is a clear commandment of what we can do when we're sick and how that we could call for the Elders of the church they can anoint us with oil pray over us and it says the prayer of faith shall save the sick and you might think that even my question a miracle or medicine or even to put it in those terms that what what is it unbelief to seek out help in being healed that might seem odd to you but I use this scripture at the beginning because some have taken this scripture to mean that God expressly forbids a Christian from seeking any other remedy than to have hands laid on them to be healed and they'll quote this and say that when God is actually I'm trying to think of some of the verbiage that I have read to where they says that God has forever separated the Christian uh from Medicine by the scripture that when you're sick you can only call for the elders to anoint you with oil and pray for you and the prayer of faith shall save the sick now I don't encourage you to Google this but I'm going to read this verbatim from a a minister uh from long ago he said I used to be a member of a church where it was considered just an offense just as offensive to take medicine or go to the doctor as it was to go to the devil for health the Christian who would run to a doctor was on the level with the adulterer or the thief that is absolutely right that is according to the word of God so this is a this is a man preaching Divine Healing a man claiming to be a man of God has quite the uh checkered past but he still nonetheless was associated with Divine Healing and revered as a as a Healer and a man with the gift of healing and he's pointing out and he does this very forcefully in a number of his sermons from many many many years ago how that it would be one who would visit a doctor is on level with an adulterer or a thief and he says that's according to the word of God now so this is a position within christiandom within Christianity that takes a scripture like this and says that a Christian only has one choice when they're sick and that's to have hands laid on them and prayed for them that they may be well to do anything else is to lean on the Flesh of man is to separate yourself from God is to become an adulterer against the word of God and and it's a very that's very forceful now if I could say this we may we may not be as extreme and I'm pretty certain that those of us here tonight in this service are not that extreme but we may have uh some internal conflict that's related to that thought process that we may have somewhat of a struggle within ourselves that tells us that well I'm sick and I'm not feeling well and then maybe we go to the doctor and they give us a prescription we start taking the prescription we're not getting any better and all of a sudden we start thinking oh well did I do the wrong thing should have I not gone to the doctor and maybe there's just a question in our minds of where do we draw the line of being one who has faith faith and is believing God for all things and someone who is maybe looking to Natural Things or uh things that could be made available to us as humans uh to give us strength to give us health or to help us to cure something and I just think that some of us on some level even if we don't realize it might have some shadow of this theology that can kind of plag our thinking a little bit is is that would some of you maybe just agree that yeah that's a challenge sometimes on some level what faith looks like when it comes to believing for our healing in Mark chapter 16: 18 it says they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover just as some has taken James chapter 5 to mean that you can only ask for prayer when you're sick and nothing else I would even ask is this scripture in All or Nothing in other words if you are the only remedy available to a Christian is to do nothing at all except have someone pray for him when we are in other words when we're not feeling well does reaching for anything other than the gos pill mean that it's unbelief reaching for anything other and I know so say we when we're we get a headache we reach for the medicine cabinet instead of reaching for Mark 1618 and taking a gospel and and maybe that makes for some kind kind of energetic preaching and I'm sure we may have all stood at some point on our feet and clapped when we heard that but you have to be careful sometimes if the underly theme behind it is that any other action other than asking for prayer is indicative unbelief just think of all the things that we might do that evidence unbelief and therefore compromise our true faith that it when I'm dehydrated I I drank water I shouldn't have done that I should have just trusted God to hydrate me or and and it just sews things in there to where you begin to doubt when you really need it you really need to have faith you start thinking well have I done something wrong do I not have faith is this evidence of unbelief and again as we mentioned on Sunday I really want the word of God to expose the devil so that he can stop plaguing us with all his little tactics so my my thesis tonight is how can we maintain a a foundation of Faith while properly availing ourselves to the means at our disposal to be strengthened to be to be c not necessarily cured but to be help help our health and I believe that we can and I want to do this in a number of different scriptures I'll say this preparation for this service was was a bear a grizzly bear a a mother Grizzly protecting her Cubs this one was a tough one and I want to look into the word of God to catch his attitude towards helps and means and Medicine even and there's a and I realized now I realized later this afternoon that we'll have to chop this up into some parts but in the sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this is a real key statement and if you want to go back and read the larger portion of this I was almost going to play a portion of this tape or just read about six or seven very lengthy statements and just say if this bothers you offends you I have to get it out I want you to see what brother Brown has to say about these things but he says now in this you see so much when you speak of bodily healing so you you when you when you talk about the healing of the body there's so many ideas there's so many statements and feelings and opinions he says that there's he says the motives and objectives of people seem to be so confused and wrong many times when it comes to our healing and the matter of believing for our healing he says there's so much that's said about it and the motives and objectives of people are confused and wrong many times when it comes to your healing when it comes to your body being well when it comes to your health when it comes to you uh uh using things at your disposal to make sure that you stay healthy or treat a disease he says that the motives and objectives are confused and and sometimes wrong just outright wrong and so when what one of the things that we're trying to look at is when it comes to bodily healing with all the things that are said about it we want to be sure that our objectives are clear and that our motives are not wrong that we could use this to understand that when it comes to the body and the wellness of the body there's a lot of uh disciplines there's a lot of approaches there's a lot of ideas and there's a lot of opinions but we want to we want to be sure that whatever whatever it is that we believe is going to help us is not ultimately something that's defiling our faith or that what we're doing we actually do believe it's going to help us and not be so detached from faith when it comes to our healing now in 2 Chronicles chapter 16:12 I start here in getting into this subject now because this is one of the scriptures that's used by the if if you're going to teach that it's a sin to go to the doctor this is one of the the main scriptures you can use so if that's what you were here tonight to find out write this down I don't mind if you do uh but this is one of the main uh weapons in their uh Weaponry against doctors and against medicine is 2 Chronicles 16:12 and it's about King ASA and ASA in the 30 and9th year of his Reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not the Lord but to the Physicians I wonder anybody could ever use that against a foot doctor but trust me I've heard all the lawyer ones about time I start collecting some doctor ones but so he had a foot disease and the Bible says that in his disease he sought he did not seek God verse 13 actually tells us that he dies uh and it doesn't necessarily say that he if I recall it doesn't necessarily say that he Des died because of his feet it just says he went on he slept he went to be with the Lord but in Anyone who reads this with an eye to be critical towards the Physicians believes that he died because he went to the doctor and if I could say this in his disease he says in his disease he sought not the Lord but went to the Physicians or sought the Physicians the way that it's written and asau did not sin by going to the Physicians which's the word physician there the root is Rafa Jehovah Rafa it's the same word as a matter of fact I'll say this it would have been his duty to do so but his in his trusting in upon them expecting healing from them and not God would have been his Heir other words just going to the doctor says he did he his dis in his disease he did not seek the Lord but the Physicians so if his expectation was that the Physicians alone could heal them if if in going to the doctor he'd completely left out the the resource of God and his trust in God and faith in God that would have been a sin to him but his faith ought to been in God and trusting in God and not the skill of the Physicians and not the the faithfulness of those in his day who could treat a wound he ought to have been believing in God and trusting in God and and even then at the same time going to the doctor but having sought God at the same time John Wesley wrote it this way about this very scripture he said the help of every creature must be used with an eye to the Creator so no matter what it is you're seeking for a remedy if it be uh if it be an oil if it be uh if it be some sort of bomb or some sort of treatment a medicine a prescription and go to the doctor a specialist or or or or or maybe an alternative Remedy or therapy we ought to it says the help of every creature must be used but if I I say the but with an eye to the Creator and in dependence on him in in dependence on him who makes every creature that to us which which is without whom the most skill ful and faithful faithful are Physicians of no value other words that with whatever we would seek whatever we would pursue we do it with an eye to God depending upon him that without him the most skillful the most faithful of doctors and the best of medicines are of no value and so as we read this scripture and we begin to identify asau asa's disease and death and his seeking out Physicians but not seeking God if I could say this his Heir was not in seeking the Physicians and if you think I'm drawing my own conclusions based upon that scripture I could accept that I'll try to do more to back up what I mean in this but maybe at the beginning I'm setting this forth as what my position is and I'll substantiate it by scripture but his sin was not in seeking Physicians but in not seeking God and if you make that a one or the other proposition that's not the case you could seek God while seeking a physician knowing that that physician without God's help and without the things that God has provided and that man not in himself but with the resources that God can give and even ability God can give him his advice or his remedy is of no value to me except God stand behind it and in Proverbs chap 17:22 let's begin to look to the word of God to catch his attitude towards medicine and helps and means says a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken Spirit drith the bones that statement in itself deserves much attention tells us just how debilitating a broken spirit is but then it says a merry heart so as we've been talking about a good attitude and a good mood and and being positive in those things the right mental attitude it says it does good like a medicine even remember on Sunday the difference between the placebo effect and the no nobo effect that there's a lot of things that at the end of the day doctors can't explain the positive benefits of something because there was nothing in it but what was it it was a good attitude maybe it was a merry heart an expecting heart someone who believed that there was something good in that and it made a difference and so the Bible says a merry heart does good like a medicine now if you're reading this and if language means anything to us it's saying medicine does good right should we take a up another offering and go home I mean this is pretty this is pretty clear he says a merry heart doeth good like a medicine in other words it implies that medicine does good and that word medicine there means a cure or healing and so this is a I would say put it in the the the positive column when it comes to medicine this is a positive reference to medicine that a good a happy heart a good spirit a positive attitude does good like a medicine does good and now in Ezekiel 47: 12 says and by the this is I'm really leading up this lengthy scripture here just to the last few of the last phrase of it but it says and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaves shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed are we allowed to believe that that would be ribey and not necessarily an apple what's what's the marbling like on that and it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months because their Waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat the fruit of the tree shall be for food and the leaf thereof for medicine now what a regardless of how that this scripture is what regardless of what time period is being described or what future uh blessedness of man's existence this is described it uses a language to say that there will be a tree that's not only good for food but there's going to be a leaf that is used for medicine the word medicine there is healing for a cure so it's an once again again it's a reference to something something that God has provided something that grows something that is available that is used for healing it says a merry heart doeth good like a medicine it refers to something that's used for healing something to allow something to be made whole here it says a leaf will be used for healing we've read this here recently in Jeremiah 8: 20 and 22 the Harvest is passed the summer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black astonishment had taken hold on me and now the cry is there no balm in Gilead this is that Bal the sav as a medicine something that would heal is there no healing Sav in Gilead it's reference to something that people say oh is there no balm they would think of some sort of ointment that would be used in warding off infection or healing disease this would have been a phrase that they immediately would Associated it with something topical that's used when someone had some sort of infliction is there no balb in Gilead is there no physician there physician there comes again from Rafa why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered is there not some kind of balsom some balm a Sav is there not a physician one who can concoct and put together and mix this up and then apply it to the wound and apply it to those that are sick again this is a reference to a bomb to a physician things that would be used to promote healing heing in Luke 10:34 when Jesus has given given the parable that ended with the question who is Thy Neighbor he speaks of the man who had been wounded and left on the Wayside bleeding and beaten half naked and half dead or naked and half dead and the Good Samaritan came by and begin to tend to him in verse 34 it says and went to him and bound up his wounds I remember going into great detail on this as a church pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an in and took care of him what did the wine do it cleansed of any infection that oil would be something that would ease the pain he was doing things he bound up the wounds he poured in oil and wine all these different elements together to promote healing rehab the wound this is something that Jesus goes into detail to show how one could care for somebody when they were physically beaten or physically torn bound up his wounds poured into the oil and wine in Isaiah 1: 5-6 it says why should you be stricken anymore ye will Revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint from the soul of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it and then and I if there was if you would like were liking more context to this I really am focusing intently on a language that is used to refer to ways that wounds or sickness or infection would be treated as it says but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment again it's speaking of an injury a wound something that's disease something that's infected and how that's in God and looking at it and trying to paint the image of a condition it's referring to a natural condition and how that things uh have not been closed or bound up and mollified with ointment treated so that they can heal treated in such a way to where the infection can stop the pain can be eased and healing and The Mending process can begin to take place and however even if I could say this God made the body that some agent can now begin to work with those with the body's ability to heal itself a and given strength and given resources could then stop something from infecting it ease the pain nourish the person to a place where their body can heal itself the Bible's referring to these very things in these several scriptures and in each one of these instances and I could have used a lot more there's no direct condemnation of medicine there's no direct condemnation of using something that's procured from a leaf nor is there any direct condemnation of using a bomb there's no direct condemnation of using medicine or Physicians but rather despite the multiple references and opportunities to be negative it never is all right I remember remember when I uh copied and pasted cut and paste pasted a whole page of notes I thought I was lost for a second we're going to save that for next Wednesday or Sunday so in in these references here these were ample opportunity for God for his own children's sake who are desirous to know and want to do what's right and to please him these were ample opportunities and I realize I've got to be careful how I say this because I'm really wanting to deal with people taking too much Liberty in the absence of things so I don't want to do the same thing myself but notice given an opportunity to bring caution or balance or even to speak against these things the Bible could have said we have no need of the bomb or we have no need of Physicians we have no need of this we have no need of that and there could have been very very forceful in a way to create a healthy uh uh abhorrence for Physicians and for medicine and bals but God is not afraid to use by analogy that things that he provides and even things that we should have are like good medicine or will be like a medicine to us in 2 Kings chapter 20 and this is uh appreciate your attentiveness tonight and and patience with a very difficult subject at least it is for me it's a a difficult subject for me because there's so much that you look at and so much you're conscious of and you you don't you want to just stay faithful to the middle of the road in the word of God and so in in 2 Kings chapter 20 it says in those days Hezekiah was sick unto death and Hezekiah weeps unto the Lord so he's been given a he knows he's going to die by virtue of his sickness and he weeps unto the Lord and even Isaiah tell told him get your house in order because you're going to die so it was very very uh severe and it says in in verse I'm just trying to find the exact place where it says that he will be healed yeah it says in verse five that the word of the Lord had come to him that he heard his prayers and he says behold I will heal thee thus sayith the Lord the god of David thy father I've heard thy prayer I've seen thy tears behold I will heal thee and on the third day Thou shalt go up under the house of the Lord so now he's sick unto death the prophet confirmed them get your house in order you're going to die he beseeches the Lord and calls upon the Lord a lot more to the story different principles we can learn from but then when he calls upon the Lord and asks to be healed and give me more time God let me help me this is uh uh what in his desperation in his pleading God says I will heal thee and then verse seven now notice this because this is where it tells us that he is healed it says and Isaiah said take a lump of figs okay this is all it tells us take a lump of figs so Isaiah's given a commandment to to uh to the people to his care caregivers and they took and laid it this what we read here is a lump of figs and laid it on the boil and he recovered so we can gather from the scripture that that uh Hezekiah was sick unto death and that maybe it and that it was manifesting itself in a boil or boils and that the prophet tells them that you're going to die he beseeches the God and the Lord speaks to Isaiah thus sayith the Lord you're going to be healed and this is how the Bible tells us he was healed a lump of figs was placed upon the boil and he was it says recovered he was healed and this uh lump of figs we might think that it's just uh a lump of just fresh figs or raw figs placed upon them but it would have been a paste of herbs and plant maybe some other substances mixed in if you the some of the reading I was doing or it would have been an actual cake of figs that was made of dried cake of figs and some of the ways that they would apply this they would spread it on a warm cloth and then it would be set upon that wound or that boil or that thing that was festering and it was to help reduce inflammation and promote healing and so here's something even a remedy that may have been available in those times something that might have been applied before it's not and we we may read this and it might seem like a kind of a oneoff but when you read the history and even um some of the things that are very prevalent in other societies at that time in that region they used medicin uh things that were available to them as medicinal resources to treat wounds to treat boils to treat infections to treat sicknesses and so God in saying thus sayith the Lord I will heal them Isaiah says take this cake of dry figs take this uh uh this paste of herbs and apply it to the boil and he recovered so I can say this God chosen a natural means to Grant the healing of Hezekiah in Isaiah CH 38: 211 it says for Isaiah had said this gives us more this is the same exact uh passage same exact instance for Isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil and he shall recover so now we see that there's taking of a natural means and applying it to the the wound and the Bible says that he recovered he was healed and I want to say this as we have posed the question tonight a miracle or medicine regardless of the active ingredient regardless of the biologically active component in the figs or the lack thereof God did it amen regardless regardless of what in in science could one day uh in break into God's Great laboratory find that that well this really wasn't a healing we found that a common illness during that time period was such and such and such and such and there's this acid in the Fig uh uh from that time period that when it makes contact with the boil especially on the big toe since your pores are bigger on the big toe and it absorbs it quicker that something happened to this boil which I don't think there's any evidence that you absorb oils more quickly on the big toe but anyways I digress that they they may say that there's something in the figs that specifically treated this type of illness that was common in that time period and they discovered the active ingredients so they're going to say well so it really wasn't a miracle it was the medicine but why can't it be both right God had told him he was going to die he was certain he was going to die he beseeched the Lord and the Lord said I'll heal you and God allowed the prophet to prescribe something that remedied the thing that was going to take his life and it says that he recovered so whether you want to say it was the medicine or you want to say it was a Miracle God did it because it was his provision this is not directly to maybe this kind of application of a medicine but in 2 Kings 4: 38-41 says an Elisha came to gilgal I'm just reading the whole story it says and there was a dir there was a famine there was a dir in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant set on the great pot and see the pottage for the sons of the prophets and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild Vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lapful and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not he gathered wild gourds but didn't know that they were W wild gourds or knew what they would do they have a poisonous nature so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage they cried out and said oh thou man of God there's death in the pot so taking something that was growing naturally that was now poisonous it's causing some sort of uh seizing up they know that there's something wrong there's something that's going to cause them to die there's a poison in the pot and they could not eat thereof and now but he said the prophet now then bring meal so they brought him cornmeal or some sort of meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people and they may eat and there was no harm in the pot so a man goes and gathers something that is poisonous and he takes up this poison and this poison is put into the pot and we know that the promisees given to us you shall take drink no deadly thing you shall not drink these deadly things and it harm you this was a poisonous substance in the pot and now the prophet is told there's death in the pot he says bring me meal right throw it into the pot and in doing so then he said pour out for the people and by the act of throwing meal in the pot it says there was no harm in the pot was that medicine or Miracle right could we rationalize it to the point and say well I mean this guy he had just been keeping up in his Farmer's Almanac and he knew that with wild gourds that are shredded in that manner that the best thing for it is to make sure you put Masa in it or something else you put put it in it and it'll bind itself it's a great binder he could have been I mean this could be a euphemism for passing out charcoal right and so he put it in the pot it's going to act as a binder it's going to do this it's going to do that whatever it is it doesn't matter the science doesn't matter to me right there was no harm in the pot and we know this is a miracle that God performed so when it comes to our healing and I I'm being very introductory very surfac tonight in this subject matter when it comes to our healing we could try to divide things to say well you have a choice you either look for you could either look for Med go to medicine or you could look for a miracle you have your choice you need to go to the doctor or go to Dr Jesus you can either get chemotherapy or Christ therapy and there might a way that we just try to draw this line and cause some well I guess I've got to choose I got to choose between uh doing something that the doctor says I can do to help me I got a choice to do something that maybe I think might be able to help me or I just Stand My Ground and only and do nothing at all and believe that God will heal me and I just want to say this I do not believe the word of God forces us to that kind of choice that even in medicine there can be a miracle that even through medicine there's healing so whether it's medicine or Miracle irle what matters is the healing right isn't that what you want isn't that what you want to be well what Wellness is about like you're not looking to be able to put in a testimony you're not wanting to be able to stand before the people say oh I I had hands laid on me and this Gorder fell off or I was diagnosed with stage four cancer and I did nothing but this or I did nothing but that I did this and I did this and I was made well don't you just want to be well and regardless of how your Wellness comes are you not going to give God the glory so at the end of the day we've got to recognize why we want to be healed what our motive and objective is and if we're just seeking after glory to be Vindicated as a Believer listen I I I guess I just say this with a there's something welling up by inspiration if you need to be healed of a sickness in order to confirm your salvation you're probably on very Dangerous Grounds that if you're looking for God to intervene in your physical ailment to kind of give you some sort of confidence that you've got faith for the body change you're you're getting things a little bit backwards but if you're sick and you want to be well be desire to be well for the wellness sake that you can serve god with everything that's in you so that you can be a mother to your children you could be a husband to your wife whatever it might be what be desired to be well for the right reasons not so that you could stand there and and and Proclaim that you've got a greater Faith than everyone else what matters is the healing whether it be through medicine or a miracle because all healing is Divine Healing I keep saying it over over and over again all healing is Divine Healing all healing is a matter of faith God is the Healer so then he is at the center then he must be at the center of our faith again I say this in a way that I feel like I I I I I just trying to maintain this balance so that if you if you believe that God's going to heal you absent absent any kind of medical intervention be sure that it's faith in Christ not fear faith in Christ that has you centered upon the promise that's why we dealt with phobia on Sunday be sure that your faith is centered on Christ that even if you go to a doctor you know that you're not in the similitude of Asa that you're still seeking God doctor whatever it might be a nutritionist whatever it is you're go whoever it is you're going to you realize that I I am not abandoning my faith in God as I take this medication as I take this prescription as I use this remedy you say w you you have a vitamin D deficiency well I'm just going to lay before the Son of God right and get all the V vitamin uh D Deliverance I need okay I believe people can have faith enough to do that and I would want you to have enough Faith to do that but don't think that the person who goes and spend time in the sun to increase their vitamin D deficiency has any less Faith than you because they're trusted in the same God to give him the same results amen the god that created the Sun the very God that designed the body that vitamin D would even be necessary remember we touched on it on Sunday we'll go into it in Greater detail maybe this Sunday God's the one that made made this body he's the one that knows how to keep it healthy and Desiring to keep it healthy is not a bad desire so then when you do those things and you seek out remedies and you seek out treatments just be certain that your heart is centered upon God knowing from him as who your help comes from your expectation is from him and that's that's what your that's what you're looking for that whenever it happens andever you you you you follow some sort of protocol you go through some sort of treatment and it runs at course and they say hey guess what we we did a we did a scan there's not an ounce of cancer in you you're completely healed and you don't praise the god of science right that's my God I believed I was going to be healed I knew I was going to be well you can give the glory to God to whom it is due now I I have a number of statements I'd like to read in this this vein and I'll just I just have two maybe a third one to read to you tonight and then uh so that we're not just this is I think there's a lot to think about already that I want you to be able just to consider in your own time and be very prayerful about but I want to read some statements that brother Brandon made that tie into this particular part because I narrowed I zeroed in more on the aspect of the medicine part and left out a lot of things on the doctor part in scripture The Physician part in scripture and in the message but these are a few lengthy statements maybe just two that touch on this brother bam in the sermon a greater than Solomon is here says the next few nights we have given to praying for the sick and we are trusting that God will continue to move and to heal those that are sick and Afflicted and now before we can approach any subject it must come from God's Eternal Word now healing is an act of faith and Faith Can't cannot rest itself upon the shifting Sands of man's theologies but it can only rest upon the unmovable Rock of God's Eternal Word so that's what we're wanting to be centered on that when it comes to our healing comes to our happiness comes to our health comes to you name it our prosperity it's centered solely upon God's word therefore Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God and Divine Healing is not something that's just oh a totem pull or a Hocus Pocus it's a Divine truth written in the word of God confirmed by the Holy Spirit and it's not limited to any denomination people Creed color it's to whosoever will just a Salvation is it is a product of a finished work that we receive by faith in the great vicarious suffering in Triumph of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus that those are some beautiful words about healing and so it tells us it's it's for those who will believe in it those who will receive it now it's this statement here that I think is really zeros in and you'll find this I found it in so many different places and there's so much breadth on this and it's wonderful to read it for ourselves and hear it so I encourage you to take time to look at these things yourself in the message of the hour notice how he's looking at a particular attitude as we mentioned in the beginning the motives and objectives are so confused and wrong when it comes to bodily healing he said so much is said today about healing and different ways that it is approached and there seems to be so much confusion about healing is this true there's so much confusion about healing as I tried last night with all my heart to make it clear that there's no other healing but Divine Healing God stands Al God God Alone stands in healing so I think that this we let's let's settle that that what he's referring to is any healing because I and I and we know this because in other places he talks about if there's a cut you can put ointment on it to stop an infection but it's the body that heals itself life is the Healer how he says it in one place so we have to realize that the way that brother Brandon puts it and I I I with my with the way that my mind works when I've been reading these statements and I'm wanting to understand it for myself and I'm certainly W to understand it with some with the inspiration before I share it with you that he's identifying that we can be certain that God made the body and anything that man identifies or finds that helps the body to be cured in remission delivered or whatever is things that God has already created and made available working even if it's synthetic man has used things that God has already created beforehand and there it's using some force or some Theory some principle something and they're applying it to the human body and it responds well to that and it results in a healing or a releasing or deliverance and brother Bam's identifying that there's no man that can back up and take credit for all of it at the end of the day there's God saying I did that and so how did he do it I made the body that way I put the elements in the earth I put these things at the disposal I let man break into my laboratory I let these things happen I think I've probably told it uh here I know I've told it a number of times for many many years the the story about how just a story fictional story lest anybody write this down and try to go look it up how a scientist had got to a place where they were so certain about their abilities and science that they finally decided that they didn't eat God anymore any how many heard this story you're probably you probably are the ones that told it and and I'll go ahead and tell it for Preston since he probably hasn't heard it before but they finally decided that they didn't need God anymore so they they chose a scientist to go to God he went to God kind of you know real humbly before the Lord says look we have made so many tremendous advancements in science we are now able to clone things and just about be able to take anything and change it and do this and do that and we've made such advancements in science and DNA that we just feel that we can begin to take care of ourselves when it comes to procreation when it comes to Health and Longevity of life and all these different things so we just respectfully ask that now that we've come to this place of Science and scientific advancement could you just back off a little bit and let us be and God said that's fair that's fine but before you do in order to to determine whether or not you're able to handle this we'll go ahead and have a man-making contest and I'll make man and you make man and then and then we will and the winner of that contest and before he even finish the son say that's fine y that's fine yeah let's we can do that we'll do it we'll make man he goes but you have to do it out of dirt and the scientist said oh that's fine that's fine we can do it we can do it out of dirt and so he says all right let's do it the scientists went off told the scientists what they need to do and they begin to gather their dirt together to make a man and God said no no no no wait a minute hold on get your own dirt right go get your own dirt in other words science is only working with the materials that God has given them and their greatest successes have been when they acknowledge that right and so when brother brandham talks about this along the lines of God being the only healer healing only coming by God if you say well I I know that's not true because I had this and I took this medicine and this worked and I did this I took that no it's to God be the glory because God's the one that made all things and he's the one that made the human body in such a way to respond to that and so no matter what angles you approach he says there's one thing God Alone stands in healing says now and this is where his mind is when he's addressing these things now we certainly admire all that science has given us but science is not a healing do we admire it science isn't consistent to the body God does the healing science can set your arm science can move a tooth science can take out an appendix or a tumor but never can science produce a recreation and that's really where you would place the miraculous aspect of it healing is a recovery but even in that re Recreation that's the miraculous aspect of healing creation is God alone and God has healed every person that ever was healed no matter what hospital or doctor office what Clinic he went to God did the healing God does not share his glory with no one he said he wouldn't and he said I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases that's where we ought to place it right especially as Christians that if if if we're looking for our healing and looking for our healing we seek out remedies or treatments or some uh uh professional or somebody that we think we can heal us don't ever forget God's the Healer don't ever don't ever get to the place where I went through this prayer line and I tried this and I believed for years and now I'm just going to go do that if you do anything along those lines then you have you you better stop right if for one minute you say well I I went the prayer route I went the faith route stop right you're in Dangerous Ground when now you've created this competition but what you can do is when seeking God for prayer and for healing you can have a faith that God is leading you to your healing through things that he makes available to you listen some people can get healed just by eating right right like every time the lights on at Crispy Cream doesn't need mean you got to go through I knew some people that when Crispy Cream is given out three dozen donuts to healthc care practitioners they took advantage of it right because well it's available to me it's free and maybe there's some things that you can do and God said now I can honor that I can bless that I can I recognize the detrimental impacts that certain things may have on me and that it's not just carnal it's not just human effort but it's a mind of Faith saying I want to be at my best for God I want to be at the best for my family I want to be healthy as a man of God whatever it might be and doing the things that you know are wise and prudent when it comes to your take taking care of your body but there's no that you have to be in that position let me come back to that that if it's a weakness of faith and a letting down of Faith pause and stop and reset recalibrate and realize that God can use means to heal us that there was nothing wrong with the word of God when you were prayed for and and and there may have it may have been nothing wrong with your faith except you hadn't quite let it anchor yet I know maybe that's a mouthful but I trust that God can use that so he says I am the Lord who Health all thy diseases so we realize that many things that have been done by Hospital work and by what the Lord has sent our doctors and science to do we realize that many things have been done by Hospital work and by what the Lord has sent our doctors and science to do and to that we're thankful and grateful notice how uh kind if we could say and considerate brother brandham was of healthc Care Professionals the whole medical industry medicine um you doctors the number of different ways he refers to them to acknowledge that God has sent them to do a work that there's things that they do to help and he says we're thankful and grateful and brother Bram is very careful to not create competition among them as a matter of fact when he says the motives and objectives of the people seem to be so confused many times he's identifying that very Dynamic where there's so much competition of the osteopath and the chiropractor and the surgeon and the medical doctor and each one wants there wants to get the money and each one wants the credit and we'll get into this in Greater detail later he says that's where the problem is and brother brandham knew that money would be the problem when it came to our health way back back then he knew 60 years ago listen it's going to come down to where money is the problem you think money is just the ones that are in the hospitals and the pharmacies they're also the ones that are pedaling their Wares online we think oh well heal Pharmaceuticals it's a billion dollar industry so are all the alternate alternatives to Pharmaceuticals multi-billion dollar industry and if you leave here going I don't know what to look for anymore well that's great got you right where need to be look up Look to Him trust him for all things but he says I'm thankful to God for the hospital work and all that the Lord has sent our doctors and scientists to do and to that we're thankful and grateful in this time this age where there's so much talk and the motives and objectives of people are so confused and wrong many times he says in one place he says it's a moneymaking thing he says if everything is right and a man has got his right motive and his right objective to it I think that each of us and all know that operation does good medicine does good the Bible said so and you know a chiropract and osteopathic many times help people we know that that's a good a to help but he says it's the money part that's the problem it's the motive and objective that's the problem my final statement tonight for the message perseverance you know many people say Oh Glory to God I just we've read part of these both of these statements I think we've read before part of it but then taking this next step and seeing what he's dealing with to me it's so beautiful he says you know many people say Oh Glory to God brother so and so laid hands on me Hallelujah I got well that kind of looks like the brother had something to do with it right that kind of looks like the brother had something to do with it now if you can just recognize the presence of Jesus Christ see and let it's his hands that count see and just accept him then nobody laid hands on you but Christ you touched him and his hands touched you and no man gets praise anywhere it's all the praise because that's all can be done anyhow this is this is focusing our faith now that even in the act of laying hands on the sick and they shall recover that it's very easy to make an idol out of the hands it's very easy to put the emphasis on the oil and not the fact that the prayer of faith and The God Who made the promise shall save the sick and so he takes us IM balances a so well it looks like the brother had something to do with it but that's but God you touched him now he says if we take any praise we're robbing God from it because God is the one that does the healing and remember there is no such thing as any man be a doctor or Minister that's a Healer I am the Lord thy God that heals all thy diseases see all and he says no medicine heals there's not no doctor claims medicine to heal no no now I if you argue semantics I I would say that doctors even acknowledge that they only make observations most of the time they're making observations all right I got to look at the doctors and make sure I'm getting this right they make observations about what's happening and don't always know exactly what's happening sometimes they do but that there's times when they say we know that this works it's proven to work is not theoretical we know that 95% of the time if you use this agent in this particular situation it works and they can talk about this and that and they can see the results but sometimes they say you know what we're not quite sure what's happening behind the curtain we just know that it works he says there's there's no doctor claims medicine to heal he says medicine only keeps clean while God heals medicine cannot build tissue cannot mend a bone you might cut an appendix out but who's going to heal the place that came out of from might pull a tooth but who's going to heal the place it came out of God is the Healer he's the only healer the scriptures don't lie they're perfectly right so he is the Healer again now now remember what he's referring to in that it's not that science may not apply a balm it may not it's not that there's not stitches but at the end of the day what is science even relying upon the body's own ability to repair itself to respond positive ly to the treatment says I'm very grateful for all things that we got like medicines that they can think of that will kill germs nothing against that but brother brandham you never lived in 2020 nothing against that I pray constantly for that now if you think this is just a oneoff he says statements to this effect so often to where you know he's not being dish inous he really did pray for doctors he prayed for medicine he was for anything that would help in this vein he says I pray constantly for that things that'll kill germs he's not against anything like that but we get someplace we don't have any medicine to help the case notice how that there's even some there's a part of him that acknowledges that there's a place for these things to help in in the areas that it can definitively help in and it kills germs and it takes care of this and it's preventative and there's ways that we could take care of ourselves to keep ourselves from experiencing certain infections and certain diseases and we ought to do those things that we should do and there's things that we can do to to set a bone and to stitch something up he says but then there's some cases that medicine cannot help all right here's your chance to amen some of you and then another thing sometimes a medicine that'll help one will kill the other one so it's not always the same thing doesn't always work for everyone he says but I know a toxin that's absolutely not a remedy but a cure and that's the blood of Jesus Christ faith in that blood is that not something we we can all agree on whether you only eat cornfed beef or grass-fed beef don't we all agree that this word is the best meat there is right isn't there something we can agree on isn't there something at the end of the day we agree that if you get your healing through this and you get your healing through that at the end of the day it says we know who healed you we know who healed you we both know it's him that's the Healer whatever it is that God uses because of our how peculiar our faith is or unique experiences or even how God's made our body up there's some people who bodies are not the same as other people's bodies they will not respond to this there's some people who can't do that there's there's so many different ways that our body needs to be helped and whatever someone can do by faith to get help and whatever helps somebody Lord help us to not be the critic Lord help us to not say anything that would weaken their Faith Lord help us be a voice that can say praise God because healing only comes from God and encourage one another and support one another in these things so that we can have the kind of faith that whether it be a medicine or a miracle it's a matter of believing God and we have faith in God for these things and we believe it's him that makes the difference
