[0:00] amen god bless your friends
[0:02] god bless you good to see you
[0:04] amen again in the house of the lord uh
[0:06] we're going to go to
[0:09] hebrews chapter 12. sorry to get that to
[0:12] you brother john hebrews 12.
[0:16] paul is going to draw a stark contrast
[0:19] between what israel faced at sinai
[0:22] and where what we are called to today
[0:29] i certainly enjoyed my time this morning
[0:33] and i just can tell you that i felt so
[0:35] at home
[0:36] here brother aaron uh gives me such a
[0:39] spirit of freedom and liberty just to be
[0:41] me
[0:42] and uh and i just felt like i was at
[0:44] home amen so just a relaxing time for me
[0:48] in the word i feel that same exact way
[0:51] again uh that okay with you or does
[0:53] relaxing be myself amen praise god i
[0:56] sure have enjoyed our time here in
[0:59] arizona and all the fellowship of all
[1:01] the friends
[1:02] amen saints of light precious faith
[1:05] nothing like it
[1:06] amen so god bless you we're going to
[1:08] carry on this afternoon
[1:11] in our thought
[1:13] about the purpose
[1:15] of the church of god in the earth and
[1:19] we'll be taking
[1:20] part two whoops wrong app we'll be
[1:23] taking part two
[1:25] of that and just trying to pick up here
[1:27] we're going to begin in verse
[1:29] uh
[1:30] did i say 20 yes
[1:33] um 22. so paul let me just quickly
[1:37] capture your minds we got a lot of
[1:38] ground to cover and i i i'm going to go
[1:42] at a at a an even pace this evening
[1:46] because i think that you're going to
[1:48] realize here especially if you were if
[1:50] you were able to be here this morning
[1:52] you're going to see that this morning
[1:53] was just a foundation to get to this
[1:56] amen
[1:57] so we're looking to do that and we're
[1:59] just going to move into it and let the
[2:01] lord
[2:02] set the pace for us amen so paul here is
[2:06] going to draw this sharp contrast to
[2:08] those who met him at sinai you remember
[2:11] the mountain's on fire and
[2:13] the sight of him even moses said even i
[2:15] quake and tremble and the people you
[2:18] know recoiled they here god went to all
[2:21] this to get them there and sent moses
[2:24] and brought them out and it was
[2:25] everything was to come to this mountain
[2:27] that's what god told moses you're going
[2:28] to go to pharaoh and you're going to say
[2:30] let my people go and when you get them
[2:32] you're going to bring them back here
[2:34] and i'm going to talk to them and i'm
[2:36] going to make a covenant with them and
[2:37] you know everybody loved the sound of
[2:39] that but uh you know it's kind of like
[2:41] john you know when he ate the book it
[2:43] was sweet in his mouth but in his belly
[2:45] my goodness you know to brother branham
[2:48] said it it's sweet in your mouth but
[2:50] when the persecution comes and the
[2:52] rejection comes and the trials come and
[2:54] the tribulation because you know you
[2:56] don't have the greatest battle ever
[2:58] fault you think you got battles become a
[3:00] christian one time
[3:03] say oh i thought being christian may a
[3:04] flowery bed
[3:05] thing but
[3:06] it's just the opposite of that you
[3:08] actually start the greatest battle ever
[3:11] fought because now you're a target of
[3:13] the enemy and so you know but just
[3:16] remember as i made a comment to you this
[3:18] morning this life is not about this life
[3:21] please remember that it's about the next
[3:22] one
[3:23] and this is we're here as a we're going
[3:26] to rule and reign with him as kings so
[3:28] our training days are now amen we've got
[3:31] to learn say what i got to learn you got
[3:32] to learn to take god at his word
[3:34] you got to learn to say amen to every
[3:36] word no matter what it costs no matter
[3:38] what the cost is you got to say i value
[3:40] god's word above everything
[3:42] amen god values his word above his own
[3:45] name the bible shows us and because his
[3:47] name was progressively you know his name
[3:49] constantly uh gave was given new names
[3:52] to show the progression but the word is
[3:55] never changing the word is unfailing and
[3:58] so his word is his is the original seed
[4:02] so if you miss
[4:04] if you miss the word for your day call
[4:06] him by whatever name you want it's
[4:08] pointless
[4:09] it's an exercise in futility because
[4:11] you've missed the key you've missed the
[4:14] most important thing and that is that
[4:16] his word is a seed that brings forth of
[4:19] its kind all right so paul is trying to
[4:21] get the church here uh these hebrews
[4:24] which were his countrymen he's trying to
[4:26] get them to understand you think that
[4:28] that was something back there you talk
[4:30] about sinai all the time i talked about
[4:33] it too i was a pharisee the pharisees
[4:34] well i'm about to tell you you're called
[4:36] to something much grander and greater
[4:38] and in some ways more terrifying than
[4:41] that see all right so he says watch this
[4:44] so you not been called to that verse 22
[4:49] verse 21 and so terrible was the sight
[4:52] that moses said i exceedingly fear and
[4:54] quake but ye now watch him ye are come
[4:56] unto mount zion and unto the city of the
[4:59] living god the heavenly jerusalem and to
[5:02] an innumerable company of angels isn't
[5:04] that eye-opening
[5:06] i mean you just thought you just were
[5:07] here and had a job and took vacations
[5:09] raised kids and lived a life no
[5:11] no
[5:12] you know oh that it were that simple but
[5:15] life here your life has much greater
[5:18] meaning behind it you need to own that
[5:19] that's what preaching is about to get
[5:21] you to own your position in christ and
[5:23] take responsibility for it see because
[5:26] the lord is counting on you brother
[5:27] branham taught us very clearly it's
[5:29] right off the tape he said there are
[5:30] some things that god will not do he's
[5:32] looking for you to do it
[5:34] see he's going to do it through you but
[5:36] he's looking for you to do it all right
[5:39] so
[5:40] but you're not but you're not called
[5:41] moses said i exceedingly fair and quake
[5:43] but year come unto mount zion and under
[5:45] the city of the living god the heavenly
[5:47] jerusalem i mean wake up and smell the
[5:49] coffee you've come to an innumerable
[5:51] company of angels you're not just here
[5:54] living out a meandering life
[5:56] to the general assembly and church of
[5:58] the firstborn which are written in
[6:00] heaven and to the god the judge and to
[6:03] god the judge of all and to the spirits
[6:05] of just men made perfect i mean you want
[6:07] to just go
[6:09] wow and to jesus the mediator of the new
[6:13] covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[6:15] that speaketh better things than that of
[6:17] abel so it's not
[6:20] the blood of abel called for vengeance
[6:22] so this is a better covenant than that
[6:24] this isn't calling this is calling for
[6:25] grace
[6:27] see
[6:27] and so see that you refuse not him that
[6:30] speaketh for if they escaped not who
[6:33] refused him that spake on earth much
[6:35] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[6:38] from him that speaketh from heaven whose
[6:41] voice then shook the earth now he's
[6:42] going to go out pick up haggai's
[6:44] prophecy in haggai chapter 2. and now
[6:47] brother branham's going to come in world
[6:48] falling apart
[6:50] and world is again falling apart
[6:52] remember those both of those messages
[6:54] and brother branham's going to come to
[6:56] hebrews 12 and and show you haggai's
[6:58] prophecy in hebrews 12 and say that this
[7:01] is now
[7:02] this is what's happening haggai's
[7:04] prophecy is right now paul picked it up
[7:07] to the hebrews and you're living it all
[7:09] right
[7:10] and whose voice then shook the earth but
[7:13] now he hath promised saying yet once
[7:16] more
[7:17] somewhere in the future
[7:19] there you read the book of revelation
[7:21] and it talks about a prophet from the
[7:23] future
[7:24] and there's going to be a prophet from
[7:26] the future who's going to appear to john
[7:29] and so much so christ like john will
[7:31] mistakenly try to worship him and he'll
[7:34] have to stop him two or three times say
[7:36] don't do that i'm only one of thy
[7:39] brethren the fellow prophets we're here
[7:41] to worship god
[7:42] and so this prophet from the future
[7:45] arrived in our day
[7:47] and so he's identifying now that what
[7:50] paul was saying
[7:52] some this is coming haggai said this is
[7:55] coming paul picks it up and said yes
[7:57] amen this is coming and a prophet elijah
[8:00] stands in this day and says now it's
[8:02] here
[8:03] what's here watch
[8:05] and and whose voice then shook the
[8:07] heaven but now he hath promised saying
[8:10] yet once more i shake not the earth only
[8:13] but also heaven and this word yet once
[8:16] more this phrase
[8:18] signifieth the removing of those things
[8:21] that are shaken
[8:22] as of the things that are made here's
[8:25] why he does it that those things we
[8:27] don't always like our lives to be shaken
[8:30] amen shaking isn't fun
[8:33] see but here's why he does it that those
[8:36] things which cannot be shaken may remain
[8:40] now the only thing that can't be shaken
[8:42] or moved is the word and that's in you
[8:44] and god's reducing you to everything but
[8:46] that
[8:48] amen that's what's happening in our
[8:50] lives he's reducing you to his word
[8:53] all right
[8:54] and your your compliance or resistance
[8:57] to that will turn will decide the
[8:59] smoothness sailing of your life or the
[9:01] rough seas it's up to you all right
[9:05] now
[9:06] wherefore
[9:07] we receive a kingdom which cannot be
[9:09] moved isn't that a great accomplishment
[9:11] so at least you have you you should you
[9:13] should love it because you can say well
[9:15] then i'm gonna receive a kingdom
[9:18] all right this is the reward a kingdom
[9:20] that cannot be moved let us have grace
[9:22] whereby we may serve god acceptably with
[9:26] reverence and godly fear for our god is
[9:28] a consuming fire that can be good or bad
[9:30] depending on which side you're on
[9:32] all right so to to egypt that pillar of
[9:35] fire was a thick darkness that scared
[9:37] them
[9:38] but to the israel it was light and
[9:40] showed the way across the red sea
[9:42] all right so
[9:44] but either way it consumes
[9:46] so it's going to it's either going to
[9:49] consume everything
[9:51] off of you that god wants off of you
[9:54] but if you resist it'll start consuming
[9:56] you
[9:57] because he's not going to lose brother
[9:59] branham taught us that that when he saw
[10:01] his image face down in genesis he said
[10:04] he he he he wasn't he wasn't content to
[10:07] see his creation laying there ruined
[10:10] because he's god and he won't be
[10:12] defeated
[10:13] and so he started building back
[10:15] and he's building now he's almost
[10:17] finished and here we are oh man all
[10:20] right let god bless the reading of his
[10:22] word as you are seated
[10:28] so this is a kingdom that cannot be
[10:30] moved i've been preaching at home a
[10:32] number of sermons and got quite a few
[10:35] more to go
[10:36] uh on on the kingdom
[10:38] and and so it looks like the lord's
[10:40] gonna force me into some uh areas that
[10:43] i've not even got to at home maybe we'll
[10:45] see i'm not sure how it's going to go
[10:46] tonight but
[10:48] but so brother branham comes here in the
[10:50] world falling apart now he's going to
[10:52] he's going to make it clear that this
[10:54] kingdom that paul is referencing that
[10:56] god is perfecting you for
[10:58] it's it's happening in real time right
[11:00] now
[11:01] and brother branham says what are we
[11:03] looking for friends this is what the
[11:05] world falling apart april 1963.
[11:08] what what are we looking for friends
[11:10] what are we the real church now how many
[11:13] are the real church
[11:14] the real church so remember i'm
[11:16] preaching on the purpose of the church
[11:18] in the earth all right the real church
[11:21] is looking not for denomination not
[11:24] looking for a president not looking for
[11:26] a genius to rise up so i i couldn't care
[11:30] less whether trump wins the white house
[11:33] back
[11:34] i know i have a republican suit on but i
[11:36] couldn't care less
[11:38] if trump wins reelection or if sleepy
[11:40] joe carries on it's immaterial to me
[11:43] because they're not in control of
[11:44] anything
[11:45] prophecy as we prove to you today
[11:47] prophecy is in control of everything so
[11:49] i want to look at the right i want to
[11:51] look at the right barometer i want to
[11:53] look at prophecy see
[11:55] and so the real church is looking not
[11:58] for a denomination not looking for a
[12:00] president not looking for a genius to
[12:01] rise up but they're looking for a
[12:04] kingdom
[12:05] and a king to come
[12:07] what is the kingdom it's on earth now
[12:10] it's a spirit mystical body of christ
[12:14] are you in it
[12:16] the good thing about it is friends think
[12:18] of this
[12:19] before we get to this kingdom in a
[12:21] millennium meaning in a millennium
[12:23] before we get to this kingdom
[12:25] before this king comes
[12:27] now we can sit together in heavenly
[12:30] places in christ jesus already see
[12:32] in christ jesus lifted up above all the
[12:35] shadows all the corruption of the world
[12:39] all their television programs all these
[12:41] other nonsense they got on the earth
[12:43] today all their rotten pollution and
[12:45] systems and everything be lifted up in
[12:48] heavenly places and the holy spirit
[12:50] himself come upon us and speak out and
[12:54] call to us our sins and tell us how to
[12:56] get straightened up and what we've done
[12:58] in life and what we're doing isn't that
[13:01] what we want
[13:02] i mean listen jesus said that the
[13:05] children who love darkness they don't
[13:08] want to come to the light because it
[13:11] exposes their sin to themselves they
[13:13] don't want to face who they really are
[13:15] by the child of god that's exactly what
[13:18] we want to know i want to know if i'm
[13:20] wrong i want to know if i'm not pleasing
[13:22] to him i want to be ex i want to be
[13:24] exposed to me now i don't want to be
[13:26] exposed to you but i want to be exposed
[13:28] to me i want to know when i look in the
[13:30] mirror of god's word that god is pleased
[13:33] with my life
[13:35] and his kingdom is now right now
[13:38] being established in the hearts of his
[13:41] people here on earth so it's all about a
[13:45] kingdom there there i'll make this
[13:48] statement to you there is there is a if
[13:50] you have a kingdom then then our lives
[13:54] if we're headed for a kingdom of god and
[13:56] we're of god then our lives ought to
[13:59] have kingdom order
[14:01] our marriages should have kingdom order
[14:04] there's a kingdom order to marry there's
[14:05] a right way and the wrong way there's a
[14:07] kingdom order and a not kingdom order
[14:10] all right there are our our our
[14:13] teenagers should be living kingdom order
[14:15] our churches should have kingdom order
[14:17] our preaching should have kingdom order
[14:19] our finances should have kingdom order
[14:22] because we're children of the king
[14:25] and we we don't have to wait for a
[14:28] millennium we that's what brother madam
[14:30] is excited about by the holy ghost you
[14:32] can go ahead and start enjoying the
[14:34] benefits of the kingdom
[14:36] what benefit is it to
[14:38] to have kingdom power because that means
[14:40] i have authority over the devil
[14:43] i have authority in my home over the
[14:44] devil over my children over the devil
[14:46] see he can't get to them because i have
[14:49] a kingdom order set in place see
[14:53] so we are a seed of god we are a light
[14:56] seed brother branham talks about how
[14:58] that you know he he references a
[15:01] narrative about this this darkness and
[15:04] he says but he says in in the in the
[15:07] vision he he sees uh i think it's a
[15:10] vision he had or someone was telling him
[15:11] a dream and he says but every once in a
[15:13] while you'd see a little streak of light
[15:16] going through that darkness he said
[15:17] that's a child of god see and so we're
[15:21] we're a we're a light seed and so here
[15:24] we are a multi-cultural race of people
[15:28] uh and and we're made of a different
[15:31] material
[15:32] than the sons of men we're sons of god
[15:35] see and so we find that that we're made
[15:38] of a material that doesn't buckle down
[15:41] to the god of this age because you're
[15:43] kingdom material you've got a light seed
[15:46] inside of you see
[15:48] we finished today concluded our we we
[15:51] hit the pause button today making the
[15:53] point that god has dropped you down in
[15:55] the middle of the darkest age ever to
[15:57] shine the light to show the world the
[16:00] deception that they've misunderstood who
[16:02] god is they've misunderstood what the
[16:03] new birth is they've misunderstood what
[16:06] he expects out of mankind
[16:09] and we're here to let our light shine to
[16:11] set the record straight to be the final
[16:13] testimony
[16:14] see to be the final voice we're not
[16:16] brother god doesn't need you or me to go
[16:18] and redo the shout
[16:20] i don't need to redo brother branham's
[16:22] message brother branham doesn't come
[16:23] back doesn't need to come back and redo
[16:25] it you understand about that we're we're
[16:28] what is our job now to become that shout
[16:31] behind skin
[16:33] to be the living word see
[16:35] and so
[16:36] so we find that we're we're the material
[16:39] that we're made of in this kingdom this
[16:41] mystical union we don't buckle down to
[16:43] the god of this age because that's a
[16:46] different kingdom
[16:48] we don't march to that kingdom
[16:50] we i'm not from here i'm from above see
[16:54] i'm an emissary from i said to you today
[16:57] that's our mission is to be in the earth
[17:00] and represent brother branham said we
[17:03] represent the the the the life of our
[17:05] rebirth
[17:07] see which is in heaven i'm not here to
[17:09] act like laodicea i'm act i'm here to
[17:12] demonstrate the life of my rebirth amen
[17:15] and be a light to the world and so we
[17:17] finally say well but i but i'm elected
[17:20] but i'm but i'm the elected child of god
[17:22] well
[17:24] first of all you've got to remember that
[17:25] brother branham taught us that it's not
[17:27] the man that comes predestinated it's
[17:29] the seed in him
[17:31] because there's only one elected son
[17:33] isaiah 42 1. there's only one elected
[17:36] son in the world ever in history that's
[17:39] christ
[17:40] say well then how am i elected because i
[17:42] was in him
[17:43] i come from him i go back to him i'm
[17:45] part of him and life is life seed of the
[17:46] seed word of his word
[17:48] life of his life
[17:50] that's what that's we are elected in
[17:52] christ see
[17:54] and so so we realize friends that that
[17:57] there's only one man
[17:59] that is leaving in the translation when
[18:02] the dead in christ shall rise and we
[18:04] which are alive and remain shall be
[18:05] caught up we'll be changed in a moment
[18:07] there's only one man leaving here and
[18:10] that's the full man christ that's you in
[18:14] the full complete image the full man in
[18:18] the image of christ that's the people
[18:21] going in the rapture
[18:23] see
[18:24] because we come to his very image and
[18:25] these elements can't be held in this
[18:27] dimension any longer
[18:29] brother branham says in sirs we would
[18:31] see jesus sir we would see jesus
[18:34] that's the only way the gospel of
[18:36] salvation
[18:38] that's the only way to be the gospel of
[18:40] salvation the gospel of deliverance the
[18:42] full gospel
[18:44] for the full man
[18:45] for the full son
[18:47] for the full daughter paradox 1965
[18:51] you've got to come back to the entire
[18:53] full gospel it was made for the full man
[18:57] by a complete god
[18:59] see so so not a part of him uh you know
[19:04] it's not a part of him taking in a
[19:05] rapture but brother branham said he's
[19:08] not coming for a deformed bride you know
[19:11] that's not made up in his very image
[19:13] he's coming for a full complete image of
[19:16] his bride which is the image of the word
[19:19] amen this is jesus christ and so it's a
[19:21] bride
[19:22] in his very image the in the fullness of
[19:25] him thousands of lived voices echoing
[19:28] amen in our daily lives do you have an
[19:31] amen in your daily life
[19:35] a man means more than mental assent
[19:39] means more than i agree with the
[19:40] theology
[19:41] it means that whatever the word calls
[19:43] for me in my life i say amen
[19:46] whatever the sacrifice whatever i got to
[19:48] give up whatever got to change if i got
[19:49] to change friends change jobs change
[19:51] locations change careers change whatever
[19:53] got to change i will say amen to the
[19:55] word of god see
[19:57] and so so we realize then that there's
[20:00] only one race leaving the earth before
[20:03] the tribulation sets in and that's the
[20:06] christ race the the light seed of god
[20:09] those who have surrendered their lives
[20:13] to kingdom order all right because we're
[20:15] we're looking for a king and we have his
[20:17] kingdom right now in the earth so
[20:19] naturally there's a kingdom order all
[20:21] right so the rapture then then you say
[20:23] well then then put the rapture in simple
[20:26] terms in the context of your sermon
[20:28] tonight it's easy to do the rapture is
[20:32] when god has all the pieces perfectly
[20:35] formed all the pieces brought into their
[20:39] position in christ then all the pieces
[20:42] are assembled suddenly and taken off the
[20:44] earth
[20:46] see
[20:47] the rapture's not
[20:49] god
[20:50] sprinkling pixie dust on you or waving a
[20:53] magic wand over you
[20:55] you know this is an assemblage this is
[20:58] this is god bringing all of his elements
[21:00] together into his order and so you you
[21:04] and this is a double negative i get it
[21:06] you can't not go in the rapture
[21:10] you will go in the rapture your body
[21:11] will change see you are going in the
[21:14] rapture as you believe this word you are
[21:17] going in the rapture and there's nothing
[21:19] you can do about it
[21:22] i love saying that
[21:24] amen
[21:26] so then there should be a kingdom order
[21:28] to all of this every facet of our lives
[21:32] would you agree with me have i made a
[21:34] scriptural case to show you this is a
[21:36] kingdom coming there's a kingdom now and
[21:38] that calls for kingdom order
[21:41] kingdom faith
[21:42] see kingdom obedience kingdom action
[21:45] kingdom reaction which is generally
[21:46] always what gets us in more trouble than
[21:48] our actions christians rarely get in
[21:50] trouble by their actions because they
[21:52] live sanctified lives it's more often
[21:53] our reactions that get us in trouble see
[21:56] but we've got to bring our spirit
[21:58] subject to the word of god bringing
[21:59] every thought subject
[22:02] people sometimes can't do that and they
[22:04] suffer from double mindedness is their
[22:05] problem
[22:06] and their faith is weak and when that
[22:08] happens you just look in the in the
[22:10] circle of your life and you'll be
[22:11] unstable in nearly every part of it
[22:14] when you when you can't when you can't
[22:16] say amen to every word and bring your
[22:18] spirit and your flesh and your mind
[22:21] subject to the thoughts of god and agree
[22:23] with god's word you're double-minded see
[22:26] because if you were really sure that it
[22:28] was true you'd adopt it
[22:30] see but you're you're you you realize
[22:32] god is leading you in one direction and
[22:34] you're trying to go in another you're
[22:35] determined to go in a different
[22:37] direction and i'm here to tell you god
[22:39] won't have it
[22:41] god won't have it
[22:42] he has ways
[22:44] all right has ways and means he'll need
[22:46] a ways and means committee he is the
[22:48] committee
[22:50] so
[22:51] you know there's this kingdom order in
[22:53] our life and there's a kingdom order in
[22:56] our service to the lord every facet of
[22:58] our lives and i can just tell you now
[23:01] without following you around
[23:03] without you know hiring a spy company to
[23:06] fly a drone over you and track your
[23:08] movements without talking to your pastor
[23:10] without doing anything without bugging
[23:12] your phone or tapping anything i can
[23:14] already tell you one aspect of your life
[23:17] for sure that satan is moving in your
[23:20] life trying to move in your life right
[23:23] now whether it might be a job a career
[23:26] an education a friendship
[23:29] a relationship
[23:31] habits you know what whatever
[23:33] satan is doing everything he can to pull
[23:37] you off of the kingdom path
[23:41] he will put everything in your life
[23:43] he'll put people he'll put careers he'll
[23:46] put finances he'll put he'll put
[23:49] opportunities in your way and and his
[23:52] just remember friends that when satan
[23:54] gives you a thought you teenagers
[23:56] remember this please
[23:58] when satan get puts a thought in your
[24:00] mind you just remember this there's a
[24:04] plan behind that
[24:06] he doesn't run around willy-nilly just
[24:08] trying to whisper thoughts into your
[24:10] head he has a plan that if he can get
[24:13] you to act on what you heard then he has
[24:16] a plan to pull you off of your path to a
[24:18] kingdom
[24:20] because then he robs you of kingdom
[24:22] power robs you of all the victory he
[24:24] satan remember satan doesn't care how
[24:26] religious you are
[24:28] and he doesn't even care this is how
[24:30] audacious he is he doesn't care that you
[24:32] come to this church he doesn't care that
[24:34] you're under a seasoned ministry he
[24:36] doesn't care how right you are in your
[24:37] doctrine
[24:39] because he knows a secret that if he can
[24:42] cause you to miss that life of the holy
[24:44] spirit and living according to the to
[24:46] the dictates of the holy spirit trying
[24:48] to lead you then he knows he'll win in
[24:50] the end anyhow you won't come up see and
[24:53] so so you realize friends you know you
[24:55] you have you you're going to take a
[24:57] journey i i heard a brother friend of
[24:59] mine give this example it meant so much
[25:01] to me it's it's noteworthy and worth
[25:03] repeating that you know when you're
[25:05] going to take a journey and you're going
[25:06] to catch a train and you've got all
[25:07] these brochures and all of these things
[25:09] and you're you're looking at where i'm
[25:11] going my when i get there it's going to
[25:13] be so beautiful and i'm going to have
[25:15] such a good time and i'm going to take a
[25:17] vacation and it's going to be grand and
[25:19] i'm going to have memories and you're
[25:20] you're excited just looking at the
[25:22] brochures
[25:24] and and but somehow you get on the
[25:26] journey and the train's going to take
[25:28] you there if you just stay on it
[25:30] but sometimes you get impatient you look
[25:32] out the window you see something oh i
[25:34] just need to jump off for a minute and
[25:36] you know what happens people get
[25:38] impatient they jump off the train and
[25:40] the train heads on and you're just left
[25:41] with a brochure
[25:43] and you're wondering where's all the
[25:44] victory
[25:46] where was all this that i was promised
[25:48] well you're you're impatient you didn't
[25:50] let god work it out because the the
[25:53] point is you're going somewhere
[25:56] i think i made that case effectively
[25:58] today you're going somewhere your life
[26:00] isn't an accident
[26:03] there's no accidents there's only god
[26:05] sides
[26:07] in your life there's no accidents
[26:09] there's only god sides
[26:11] in the life of his family
[26:15] we're headed somewhere all right
[26:17] so hebrews 12 and to jesus the mediator
[26:21] of the new covenant and to the blood of
[26:23] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[26:26] than that of abel so it's going to speak
[26:29] of forgiveness instead of crying out for
[26:32] vengeance like the like the blood of
[26:34] abel did all right so verse 28 wherefore
[26:37] we receive a kingdom which cannot be
[26:40] moved see so let us have grace whereby
[26:43] we may serve god acceptably
[26:46] because our god with godly fear because
[26:48] he's a consuming fire so this means that
[26:50] all creation will be shaken
[26:53] and removed so that only unshakeable
[26:56] things will remain
[26:58] since we are receiving a kingdom that is
[27:02] unshakable then let us live a life of
[27:05] grace let us be thankful let us please
[27:08] god by worshiping him in holiness and
[27:11] righteousness why because we are we're
[27:14] being we're becoming part of a kingdom
[27:17] which cannot be
[27:18] moved haggai in his prophecy you don't
[27:22] have to put it up brother john because
[27:23] i'm going to read it from the nlt unless
[27:24] you happen to have that res
[27:26] that version uh the new living
[27:28] translation haggai 2 6-9
[27:32] for this is what the lord of heaven's
[27:34] armies says
[27:36] in just a little while i will again
[27:39] shake the heavens and the earth the
[27:41] oceans and the dry land
[27:45] i will shake all the nations
[27:48] and the treasure of all the nations
[27:51] will be brought to this temple so you
[27:53] can see god is moving by the time this
[27:55] prophecy comes on the scene this is why
[27:56] it's significant that brother branham
[27:58] picks it up in a world falling apart
[28:00] because now that we're nearing the
[28:01] millennium we're nearing home friends
[28:04] and so it's time to don't wait to look
[28:06] like a king's child there start looking
[28:08] like a king's child here see
[28:11] so i will shake all the nations and the
[28:13] treasures of all the nations will be
[28:15] brought to this temple
[28:17] i will fill this place with glory says
[28:20] the lord of heaven's armies
[28:22] the silver is mine and the gold is mine
[28:24] says the lord of heaven's armies the
[28:27] future glory of this temple will be
[28:29] greater than its past glory says the
[28:32] lord of heaven's armies and in this
[28:34] place i will bring peace i the lord of
[28:37] heaven's armies have spoken
[28:40] so you can see of course you can see we
[28:43] know who the armies of heaven are
[28:46] it's god's family it's his kingdom you
[28:48] don't have a kingdom without people and
[28:51] so god has a kingdom of saints
[28:53] paul
[28:54] told them that in hebrews 12 you haven't
[28:56] come to sinai that's just a mountain
[28:58] that shook but you've actually come to
[29:00] the place the spirits of
[29:02] just men made perfect you've come to
[29:04] jesus the mediator you've come to the
[29:05] heavenly jerusalem see yeah and so
[29:08] you've come to an innumerable host see
[29:11] and now you you see that you see that in
[29:13] zechariah because when zechariah and
[29:16] zechariah when joshua the high priest
[29:18] was standing there at at the trial
[29:21] israel was in israel had been indicted
[29:23] by satan and and satan is bringing an
[29:26] accusation against them that
[29:29] that they can't be your people now if he
[29:30] can win his case he's he's suing he's
[29:32] suing god
[29:34] and if he can win his case then he gets
[29:36] to take over because then god's word
[29:38] will fail because god has said these are
[29:40] my people and satan's saying based on
[29:42] their conduct they can't be your people
[29:44] it's impossible you have failed to make
[29:46] them your people therefore you have to
[29:47] give up the throne and let me have it
[29:49] and god now he had all the evidence he
[29:51] had them dead to rights he had the dna
[29:53] he had the instant replay he had
[29:55] eyewitnesses he had fingerprints he had
[29:57] everything that you had ever done
[29:59] everything that was ever guilty of
[30:00] that's why joshua was the high priest
[30:02] satan that satan didn't have to sue the
[30:04] whole nation
[30:05] see and that whole nation didn't have to
[30:07] appear at the courtroom before the one
[30:09] seated on the throne remember in daniel
[30:11] 9 he's seated and and we find that
[30:14] satan's bringing his case
[30:15] and he's saying they're guilty and i've
[30:18] got the evidence to prove it and god
[30:20] dismisses his charges completely out of
[30:23] hand based on one simple principle this
[30:27] is my people whom i have chosen
[30:30] based on elections satan all your claims
[30:32] all your evidence is worthless
[30:35] there is now therefore no condemnation
[30:37] to them which are in christ jesus no
[30:40] indictment is possible they can't be
[30:41] charged they can't be arrested you can't
[30:43] they have full diplomatic immunity
[30:45] because they're not from here they're
[30:46] from another kingdom
[30:48] and they enjoy of immunity from
[30:51] prosecution therefore your case is
[30:53] summarily dismissed get out of my
[30:54] courtroom and that and and and that's
[30:56] why
[30:58] that's why zachariah got so excited and
[30:59] put a fair miter on his head because
[31:01] brother m said you know that's a that's
[31:03] an authority and brother brandon said i
[31:04] don't call you church anymore i call you
[31:06] bride it's a whole sermon i want to get
[31:07] preaching on it but but i'm here to tell
[31:09] you that that that because of election
[31:12] because you came from god
[31:15] and you're part of god
[31:17] and christ is your representative you
[31:19] see and so he's he's your total
[31:22] satisfaction he both sides he was your
[31:25] atonement because he his life was virgin
[31:29] born and worthy to be a sacrifice to be
[31:32] the sacrificial lamb but there also had
[31:35] to be the perceptive side lived out
[31:36] because precept must be upon precept and
[31:39] god couldn't accept a halfway life now
[31:41] you can't you were never able to
[31:43] accomplish it i haven't been able to
[31:45] accomplish it so christ was not only our
[31:47] atonement but he lived the perceptive
[31:50] side on my behalf and therefore he's my
[31:52] total satisfaction in christ
[31:56] see
[31:56] and so so we realized then that that you
[31:59] see this army he says to to to joshua
[32:03] that if you'll keep my statutes and obey
[32:05] my word then i'll give you the right to
[32:07] stand among all these you see and then
[32:09] you see them again there's many places
[32:11] in the bible where prophets saw that
[32:12] great host john saw it in revelation 5.
[32:16] see
[32:17] john saw the heavenly host saw the
[32:19] angels saw one seat on the throne see a
[32:20] glass here's a strong angel representing
[32:23] the elijah ministry here's john
[32:24] representing the bride here's the 424
[32:27] elder the 24 elders you know 12 in the
[32:29] old testament 12 in the new testament
[32:31] here's one of those elders saying to
[32:32] john don't we the lion of tribe of judah
[32:35] remember all that in revelation 5
[32:36] notice everybody's there except one
[32:38] person
[32:39] the accuser
[32:42] you know why because he got dismissed in
[32:43] zechariah 3.
[32:45] see his his position to accuse the
[32:47] saints now he he can he still has the
[32:50] right to cause his trouble he's he's a
[32:53] puppet in the hands of god he's not
[32:55] literally cast out physically until
[32:56] revelation 12 we see
[32:59] him cast down because brother brown said
[33:01] when the bride goes up satan comes down
[33:03] but don't lose the sight of the fact
[33:06] that he's already been he's already been
[33:08] cast down from his ability to accuse you
[33:11] he can accuse you but it don't count
[33:13] it's already settled in heaven
[33:16] and when the book is claimed god just
[33:18] wasn't even going to have that loud
[33:20] mouth around the book is claimed the
[33:22] seals are broken and john is now eating
[33:24] the book and satan has no say
[33:29] no involvement see
[33:31] and then of course you see them fully
[33:33] assembled
[33:35] armies translated into glorified bodies
[33:37] in revelation 19
[33:39] following christ out
[33:41] at the end of the
[33:43] tribulation period to take our part with
[33:46] christ in the final uh judgment of
[33:49] armageddon so
[33:50] so then so so so we realize then that
[33:53] this reference to haggai 2 6
[33:56] is understood as speaking of the
[33:58] ultimate remaking of heavens and earth
[34:02] and which because even even that's going
[34:04] to follow the millennial kingdom and so
[34:07] therefore what remains after this
[34:10] cataclysmic event
[34:12] of the shaking
[34:13] will be eternal
[34:16] so when when god finishes shaking the
[34:19] world in the world is falling apart as
[34:22] brother rams said and then he said the
[34:24] world is again falling apart and it's
[34:27] going to go into a tribulation and
[34:29] armageddon is going to finish the matter
[34:31] and when god sets up a millennium and
[34:33] then he comes out to the millennium and
[34:35] breaks into a new heavens and a new
[34:36] earth that everything that he shook
[34:39] down is now going to leave only what's
[34:42] eternal which is his family back in the
[34:45] eternal earth
[34:47] now that's beautiful friends because
[34:49] that means that whatever was that that
[34:52] that means that whatever was original is
[34:55] coming back so what so so what so the
[34:58] power of this new covenant
[35:01] this new covenant he said i'm i've shook
[35:03] the earth but at the end time i'm going
[35:06] to send a prophet and he's going to
[35:07] identify this prophecy that i'm not only
[35:10] shaking earth but i'm shaking heaven i'm
[35:13] shaking everything and whatever whatever
[35:15] can be shaken from my people i'm gonna
[35:18] shake it from them and the power of this
[35:20] new covenant is to restore you and
[35:23] restore me back to original
[35:27] back to eternal thank god for that that
[35:30] means that nothing that this sin birth
[35:32] hang hang on hung on me will survive
[35:36] think of that friends nothing the sin
[35:38] birth hung on you will survive nothing
[35:40] that that circumstances in life put on
[35:42] you complexes weaknesses even things you
[35:45] did to your own self i'm here to tell
[35:47] you this message is shaking it all off
[35:50] of me
[35:51] it's returning us back to a virgin
[35:54] condition as though we never did it in
[35:55] the first place
[35:58] nothing that happened to me in my life
[36:02] that created a weakness for satan to
[36:03] exploit
[36:05] none of the things i've even done to
[36:06] myself that causes me harm today
[36:09] get to
[36:10] survive thank you lord
[36:13] so brother branham comes to the pulpit
[36:15] there in those closing months
[36:17] of 1963 and he preaches the world
[36:20] is falling apart see
[36:23] and now here's an interesting thing
[36:25] believers look at the chaos of the world
[36:28] and they easily accept that the time of
[36:31] shaking in heav of heaven and earth is
[36:33] here you can look at the chaos and say
[36:35] yeah i get that but but all but
[36:37] believers are too often afraid to
[36:39] realize
[36:40] that there's another half to the promise
[36:42] that not everything is destroyed
[36:46] what can't be shaken
[36:48] will remain
[36:50] so why is that important because there's
[36:51] too many times that we let the devil get
[36:54] us over a barrel and let him and get in
[36:56] our mind get to thinking there's no hope
[36:59] for me i can't beat it i can't get but i
[37:02] can't survive it this is going to take
[37:03] me out this is too much of a weakness if
[37:05] he only knew my problem if you only knew
[37:07] what happened to me forget it i'm here
[37:09] to tell you that when this prophecy of
[37:11] haggai comes to pass
[37:13] nothing that the enemy has ever put on
[37:15] you is going to survive this
[37:18] god is going to have a kingdom of free
[37:21] people there is a kingdom people who
[37:24] will stand up and rise up in this hour
[37:27] recognize their day and its message a
[37:29] kingdom people who will leave here as
[37:32] overcomers how many want to be an
[37:33] overcomer
[37:35] see and so it has so i all i need to do
[37:38] then is surrender to live under the
[37:41] power of this new covenant it has power
[37:45] to allow me to let those things go
[37:48] and live free do you believe that
[37:50] friends i'm here to tell you the power
[37:52] of the holy ghost i don't care how many
[37:53] times it's got you how weak you feel
[37:55] against it battles of your mind battles
[37:58] of your flesh battles battles in your
[38:00] spirit i don't care what it is i'm i'm
[38:03] trying to put you on notice that the
[38:05] remedies arrived
[38:07] the remedy is here
[38:09] this is the time when hagia's prophecy
[38:11] that paul carried on it's now
[38:13] and god is bringing this anointing upon
[38:16] us sure of course it's always a battle
[38:19] but i can win it now
[38:21] because why because i got a new covenant
[38:24] i don't have to be victim to it god has
[38:26] a kingdom power released to the church
[38:29] to get zion into a kingdom position that
[38:32] cannot be moved and so he's shaking
[38:35] everything loose from our lives to
[38:37] prepare us for the millennium that is a
[38:40] kingdom that will never end
[38:43] so this is literally restoring the
[38:45] genesis image of you when you stood
[38:48] perfect in the view of god and that's
[38:51] brother branham called it the first
[38:52] place i never sinned in the first place
[38:55] in the first place i was in christ and i
[38:57] was flawless that's what this anointing
[39:00] that's what this message this new
[39:03] covenant that paul recognized in his day
[39:06] that's now been restored in our day
[39:08] that's what it brings to you it doesn't
[39:11] bring you the ability to join a church
[39:14] it doesn't bring you an ability just to
[39:16] sing in a choir or just to say the bible
[39:18] taught this or the prophet taught this
[39:20] it's so much more than that friends it
[39:22] gives you the ability to become kingdom
[39:25] family
[39:28] in the first place see
[39:31] all of our accumulated
[39:33] you know life of failures and
[39:36] i've accumulated too many myself i'm
[39:38] here to tell you the lord is shaking off
[39:39] their effect in me amen satan is losing
[39:42] his grip
[39:44] because i've recognized what this
[39:46] message came to do see
[39:48] now
[39:49] paul says
[39:52] i'll just read a portion of this 14th
[39:55] verse of the fourth chapter to ephesians
[39:58] here's a part of why the gospel has come
[40:00] to us
[40:01] here's why this kingdom covenant is
[40:04] among us
[40:05] that we henceforth be no more children
[40:08] tossed to and fro
[40:10] and carried about
[40:12] and it's it's a sad reality
[40:15] when a believer has to be carried
[40:19] see when a
[40:20] a wife has to carry the husband because
[40:22] he's so weak
[40:24] mentally emotionally
[40:26] see spiritually and she's got to carry
[40:29] the load or vice versa see it's it's a
[40:32] shame when a pastor has to carry the
[40:35] people
[40:36] because they're they're like children
[40:39] and if he doesn't carry them they just
[40:40] get tossed around
[40:42] see and so so the gospel has come that
[40:46] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[40:49] to and fro that you know trials don't
[40:52] knock you off pace
[40:54] satan can't doesn't satan satan loses
[40:57] the ability uh you know he can
[41:00] anything can terrify a child because
[41:02] they don't understand the world
[41:04] you know the grown-up can just look out
[41:06] the window and make up a whole story oh
[41:07] it's a monster and the child will go
[41:09] screaming because the child doesn't have
[41:11] the common sense to look out the window
[41:12] and see mom's kidding
[41:14] amen so a child you you can do things
[41:17] that a child your what you're doing is
[41:19] good for them
[41:20] you're uh honey you know give me that
[41:23] knife no don't give it here
[41:25] but i want it but no no i know better
[41:27] you don't need to be carrying that
[41:29] through the house see that child doesn't
[41:31] understand to him it's a trial why is
[41:34] mom being so cruel to me but mom is an
[41:37] adult she's not a child she's mature she
[41:39] knows he needs to have that taken from
[41:41] him
[41:42] so so this gospel has come into this
[41:44] hour to not to not have us be children
[41:48] that we can be mature god christ isn't
[41:51] coming back to marry a little girl the
[41:54] this word born bride was an infant in
[41:56] one time but now she's mature he's
[41:58] coming back to mary the full word the
[42:01] image of himself grown matured ready can
[42:04] handle anything see
[42:11] david says in psalms 42 if you want to
[42:13] put it up brother john you can psalms 42
[42:16] 1-7 as the heart as the deer we would
[42:18] say
[42:19] as the heart panteth after the water
[42:21] brooks
[42:22] so penteth my soul after thee o god
[42:25] my soul thirsteth for god for the living
[42:28] god
[42:29] when shall i come
[42:30] and appear before god
[42:33] psalms 42 3 my tears
[42:36] have been my meat day and night while
[42:37] they continually say to me where is thy
[42:39] god see david had known great
[42:41] wonderful victories in god but this was
[42:43] a time when he had known terrible defeat
[42:47] and now david's life had went in a
[42:49] direction
[42:50] opposite of god's intention
[42:54] god has
[42:55] a pace and a direction and a destination
[42:58] for your life
[43:00] and when you go off of that path or you
[43:04] might even stay kind of on the path but
[43:06] you're going too slow
[43:08] you're not maturing quickly enough
[43:09] because maybe you don't come to church
[43:11] enough maybe you don't read your bible
[43:13] enough maybe you don't pray enough maybe
[43:15] you don't do any all of the above enough
[43:18] and you're a believer and you're moving
[43:19] along but you're not making progress i'm
[43:21] going to here to tell you something
[43:22] friends god has ways of bringing things
[43:25] upon you to speed you up
[43:28] to bring you back onto the path that he
[43:30] has for you david got off that path
[43:33] verse 4
[43:34] when i remember these things i pour out
[43:36] my soul in me for i had gone with the
[43:39] multitude i went with him to the house
[43:41] of god with the voice of joy and praise
[43:44] with a multitude that kept holy day see
[43:46] he tried to he tried to just you know
[43:49] psyche his self out i'll just go to
[43:50] church and sing some songs clap my hand
[43:52] and tap my foot and get my blood moving
[43:53] and i'm going to get victory over this
[43:55] you're not going to get victory over it
[43:56] till you repent
[43:57] until you come back to god humbly and
[43:59] ask god to restore you see
[44:02] and why he comes right to the next verse
[44:04] to show that that didn't work verse 5
[44:07] why art thou cast down o my soul
[44:10] why art thou disquieted in me hope thou
[44:12] and god come on for i shall yet praise
[44:15] him for the help of his countenance oh
[44:18] my god my soul
[44:20] is cast down within me therefore will i
[44:23] remember thee from the land of jordan
[44:26] and of the hermenites from the hill of
[44:28] mazar
[44:29] deep calleth unto the deep at the noise
[44:33] of thy waterspouts all thy waves now
[44:36] catch this
[44:37] all thy waves and thy billows
[44:40] are gone over me
[44:43] so david is describing he's trying to
[44:45] fight against it he's trying to
[44:47] encourage himself he's trying to go to
[44:48] church but he's he you know it what he
[44:51] did is gonna take some some
[44:54] some fruit some meat of repentance he's
[44:57] he's committed a horrible failure and
[44:59] now he's got to work his way back to god
[45:02] and he's got to show his dedication and
[45:05] you know what when you get in that
[45:06] condition you say well i go to church
[45:08] and i don't i don't really feel better
[45:10] just keep coming
[45:11] so when i pray but my prayers don't get
[45:13] higher than the ceiling just keep
[45:14] praying
[45:16] god is looking to see how serious you
[45:18] are he's not here you know to just pat
[45:20] you on the head and say oh i'm sure
[45:21] you'll do better next time okay go ahead
[45:23] no
[45:24] this is a heavenly father who's trying
[45:26] to train you stay on the train the train
[45:29] is taking you somewhere see
[45:35] jonah comes in jonah chapter 2
[45:38] verse 1 and 3 then jonah prayed unto the
[45:40] lord his god
[45:42] out of the fish's belly
[45:44] and said i cried by reason of mine
[45:47] affliction unto the lord and he heard me
[45:50] out of the belly of hell cried i
[45:53] and thou heardest my voice
[45:55] for thou hast cast me into the deep in
[45:58] the midst of the seas and the floods
[46:01] compass me about and here's this curious
[46:04] word again
[46:05] all thy billows and thy waves passed
[46:09] over me that's the word right where
[46:10] david was that's what exactly what david
[46:13] said thy billows are going over me all
[46:15] thy waves and thy billows are gone over
[46:18] me here's job saying all thy billows and
[46:20] thy waves passed over me
[46:24] now i don't i don't i'm going to show
[46:25] you a demonstration tonight and it's
[46:28] called the calvin helmholtz instability
[46:31] experiment all right it's brief i'm
[46:33] going to show you two clips of it one is
[46:35] less than a minute one's about a minute
[46:37] and a half and i'm going to show you
[46:39] this because it'll give you a really
[46:40] good visual
[46:42] image of what's of what can be happening
[46:45] sometimes in our lives now let me
[46:46] explain some of the science to you
[46:48] before i do
[46:49] all right
[46:51] now
[46:52] we're going to be dealing specifically
[46:55] with shear that gets created over the
[46:58] surface of water and there's a number of
[47:00] things that can that can cause shear now
[47:03] that's a broad term uh captain john has
[47:06] to deal with sheer and wind currents and
[47:08] you know he can be he can be coming in
[47:10] at a you know coming in for a landing up
[47:12] in this and he's got a headwind and that
[47:14] headwind now he's got his speed and his
[47:16] angle of his flaps and it's all good and
[47:18] he's he's got his approach and then he
[47:20] has to be careful because when he drops
[47:22] down then he'll drop down and then he
[47:23] loses that headwind it's a different
[47:25] atmosphere it's running the the wind is
[47:27] not coming head-on at him and now
[47:28] suddenly the plane is falling and he's
[47:30] got to spool up the engines adjust the
[47:31] flaps you ever been coming in on a final
[47:33] approach and you're getting lower and
[47:35] you're getting lower and all of a sudden
[47:36] you hear the engines go cranking
[47:38] that's the pilot because he's he's
[47:40] working on those wind currents and he's
[47:42] got to be careful of a microburst
[47:44] because which
[47:45] i guess doppler radars handled a lot of
[47:47] that for you brother john but back
[47:49] before they used to have that they'd
[47:51] have a microburst that would come down
[47:52] and if it and if it came on the end they
[47:54] approach into the runway it's very
[47:56] deadly because it comes straight down
[47:58] and hits it and then it goes like that
[48:00] and it'll throw an up current out here
[48:02] and here comes the pilot with his speed
[48:04] set and he hits that updraft and you
[48:06] know what he's trying to land he don't
[48:07] want to go up so you know what he does
[48:09] naturally he pulls back on the power i
[48:11] got to get this thing on the ground and
[48:13] then suddenly that that up current is
[48:15] gone he hits the microburst and it slams
[48:17] him into the ground and there's no way
[48:18] he has time to spool the engines back up
[48:21] many planes i landed at charlotte and
[48:24] just a few weeks ahead of when i was
[48:26] landing even the whole ground was still
[48:27] burning the fence was knocked down where
[48:29] that very exact same thing happened
[48:31] before they installed the doppler radar
[48:32] at charlotte douglas and they didn't see
[48:34] it it hit right at the end of the runway
[48:36] and he he flew into it and he powered
[48:39] back and it drifted down and then he hit
[48:41] the downdraft and there's no way to get
[48:43] it and the plane hit the ground probably
[48:45] 50 yards ahead of the runway and blew up
[48:46] and killed everybody
[48:48] see
[48:49] and so
[48:50] so that's that's sheer
[48:52] you know you can have winds like this
[48:54] and winds like this and then and in that
[48:56] line of demarcation between winds going
[48:58] this way and winds going that way it
[48:59] creates a sheer you have winds up here
[49:02] and winds down here and there's a shear
[49:04] line well
[49:05] when wind blows over water
[49:07] if the water's trying to go this way and
[49:10] the wind's trying to go that way it
[49:12] creates a sheer
[49:13] and then that you see white caps you see
[49:16] waves you see you see oceans and billows
[49:19] and storms what's happened the wind is
[49:21] moving over the water and it's moving
[49:23] faster than the water and the water gets
[49:25] all in a turmoil amen it's called bill
[49:28] as you can see bill is in cloud
[49:29] formations and and and there's a famous
[49:32] painting about builders i forget which
[49:33] which artist uh that that did it and um
[49:37] and and you'll you'll see these billows
[49:39] of clouds or billows of waves and here
[49:42] here david is saying all thy waves and
[49:44] thy billows and jonah's saying all thy
[49:46] billows and thy waves
[49:48] have gone over me
[49:49] now
[49:51] what causes that and i'm going to show
[49:52] you this this this instability
[49:55] experiment
[49:56] what they're going to do is they're
[49:58] going to take
[49:59] uh
[50:00] a tank a sealed tank
[50:03] and they're going to put
[50:04] fresh water in first
[50:06] which is heavier and is going to stay on
[50:08] the bottom
[50:09] then they're going to slowly move salt
[50:11] water in and the salt water is lighter
[50:13] so it'll go above the fresh water and
[50:15] and it'll be two different kinds of
[50:17] water salt water and fresh water and
[50:19] they'll actually put a dye in the fresh
[50:21] water so you can see the lower water in
[50:23] the upper water all right it's both
[50:24] water but one salt one's fresh and they
[50:26] do it slow so that they don't disturb it
[50:28] because they want that perfect
[50:31] that perfect line between the two
[50:34] amen
[50:35] now what what they do then
[50:38] is they
[50:39] tilt the tank
[50:41] now
[50:42] because the fresh water is heavy it
[50:46] wants to run downhill
[50:48] but because the salt water is light it
[50:50] wants to get back floating on the top it
[50:52] goes uphill
[50:53] and that
[50:55] like that when it does that it creates
[50:57] sheer and you're going to see
[51:00] what happens in your life
[51:03] when god's got this direction for you
[51:06] but you want to go this way
[51:09] amen
[51:11] let's see it brothers
[51:18] there's no sound and i've got it that
[51:19] way on purpose this one doesn't even
[51:21] have it anyway this is the experiment
[51:22] now you're going to see it
[51:24] salt water above fresh water on the
[51:26] bottom with dye color he tilts it
[51:28] everything looks fine right it doesn't
[51:30] happen immediately see the fresh water
[51:32] trying to go downhill now watch what
[51:34] happens to your life watch
[51:37] wait for it
[51:38] boom
[51:40] billows
[51:41] it's a phenomenon of the physical world
[51:44] all right let's watch it again let's
[51:46] watch it again they're going to do it in
[51:47] slow mo everything's fine oh my life is
[51:49] going along wow something's going on
[51:52] lord what are you doing oh let me just
[51:53] pray harder lord i'm sure it'll get
[51:54] better lord you'll take care of me right
[51:56] oh lord i believe your word what's going
[51:58] on in my life lord what's happening what
[52:00] are you doing to me why is my life in
[52:02] turmoil and this is what happens in
[52:04] people's lives
[52:06] all right let's go let's here here here
[52:08] they're going to show it again on a
[52:09] graph and that's what happens
[52:12] billows that's what you see on water you
[52:14] see a seed tossed in turbulence see it's
[52:17] because of sheer over the water has
[52:19] caused that all right go ahead and take
[52:21] that down and pull up the next one
[52:24] same thing again a little bit of a
[52:25] longer a little bit longer of one just
[52:27] to give you a really good visual because
[52:29] i think that's important i think you'll
[52:31] be able to see
[52:33] you're going to be able to explain to
[52:34] yourself and if you can't get it i'm
[52:36] going to help you
[52:38] i'm going to show you why sometimes the
[52:40] things in our lives and we wonder why is
[52:43] god doing this to me it might not be god
[52:48] all right
[52:50] let's keep watching here's our scientist
[52:52] lady
[52:53] she's got fresh water on the bottom with
[52:55] blue dye she's got salt water now she
[52:57] tilts it same thing she's showing this
[53:00] instability experiment they're zooming
[53:03] in boom
[53:05] there's your life
[53:07] topsy-turvy turmoil flipping you don't
[53:10] understand what's going on uh and and
[53:13] watch they'll keep doing it again i
[53:15] think they'll go there's a slo-mo
[53:17] there's a slo-mo that's your life when
[53:20] you're when god tries to go this way for
[53:22] you because you're a kingdom child yes
[53:25] amen god's god's trying to make you a
[53:27] kingdom child but you're determined to
[53:29] go like this
[53:30] see
[53:31] watch
[53:33] turmoil that's that's what happens here
[53:35] we go again here's a nice slo-mo
[53:37] right oh what's going on lord you'll
[53:40] help me surely you help me lord i know
[53:42] you'll do it i know you're my joy and my
[53:43] whole life lord what are you doing to me
[53:46] i thought i was a christian i i thought
[53:48] i could depend on you i thought you were
[53:51] you're a very present help in time for
[53:52] trouble what are you doing
[53:54] well i was surely it'll get better
[53:55] tomorrow to be better tomorrow oh sunday
[53:57] it'll be better i'll get further there
[53:58] and i'll have right there and pray for
[53:59] me why is it getting worse
[54:02] god you don't love me oh it can't get
[54:04] any worse now i'm sure that's as bad as
[54:05] it can get until it does
[54:08] it can't get any worse until it does
[54:12] i think we've seen enough brothers
[54:15] it makes you uncomfortable to look at
[54:17] that doesn't it
[54:23] it's not always the devil causing
[54:25] billows in your life
[54:30] it's not always the devil
[54:32] causing billows in your life
[54:35] if god has a vision for your life that's
[54:39] the upper stream
[54:42] if your lower life
[54:45] is going in the opposite direction
[54:48] you get me
[54:50] you're creating the shear
[54:54] you're causing the turmoil
[54:57] if you're languishing
[54:59] if you're failing to make progress and
[55:02] the wind of god's determination say well
[55:04] i am a christian i'm going in god's way
[55:06] but you're moving along and the wind is
[55:08] trying to get you to move faster and you
[55:10] don't you create sheer
[55:13] you bring billows and turmoil in your
[55:16] life
[55:17] you're because you're living out of time
[55:19] your life isn't in time and harmony and
[55:21] rhythm and that's what brother branham
[55:22] brings to us in shalom that it's all a
[55:24] great drama that it's a symphony that
[55:26] it's a great musical drama he says where
[55:30] you know music's so amazing brother
[55:32] branham said you can close your eyes and
[55:34] live in it
[55:37] and that's god looking at your life
[55:40] god wants to look at your life and live
[55:43] in your life
[55:44] god wants to make you a kingdom child
[55:47] this is the hour of shaking not only the
[55:51] earth but shaking heaven and earth your
[55:55] your billows then are brought on by you
[55:58] and i want to say this
[56:00] it may not be god punishing you
[56:04] it's likely god actually acting in
[56:07] faithfulness toward you
[56:10] those billows can be god's faithfulness
[56:13] acting towards you in love
[56:16] you see this is why
[56:18] put put verse three of jonah back up for
[56:20] me
[56:21] brother john jonah uh where we in uh we
[56:23] were in uh in jonah chapter two and
[56:26] let's look at verse three again
[56:28] oh my
[56:30] for thou
[56:32] he says here let me let me let me catch
[56:34] the one above it and and said i cried by
[56:37] reason of my affliction unto the lord
[56:39] and he heard me out of the belly of hell
[56:40] cried i and thou heard us my voice watch
[56:44] this third verse
[56:45] for thou
[56:46] hast cast me into the deep see
[56:51] in the midst of the seas
[56:53] and the floods compass me about all thy
[56:56] billows and thy waves passed over me for
[56:59] thou
[57:00] hast cast me
[57:02] into the deep
[57:09] jonah realized god had thrown him
[57:10] overboard
[57:12] not his shipmates
[57:14] it wasn't the ship's crew that threw
[57:16] jonah over
[57:17] they physically acted out but jonah
[57:20] realized that it was god
[57:23] it was not his shipmates sometimes
[57:26] friends it's not your you say oh they
[57:28] said this against me they did this i
[57:30] know that pastor is preaching on me i
[57:31] know the church i know that people are
[57:32] looking thinking laughing i know my wife
[57:34] i know my husband i know what's
[57:35] happening this is somebody's fault
[57:40] it might not be the pastor that threw
[57:42] you overboard
[57:43] might not be your spouse that threw you
[57:45] overboard might be god
[57:48] it might be god that threw you overboard
[57:51] see
[57:52] might not be your shipmates
[57:55] at all
[57:57] it was god to jonah
[58:00] it was god acting in faithfulness toward
[58:04] his son
[58:07] that's where i want to be yielded today
[58:10] that's where you need to be yielded
[58:12] today i've proven to you by
[58:14] bible prophecy by a prophet in this day
[58:16] showing you this is the hour of hebrews
[58:19] 12. this is the hour of haggai chapter
[58:22] 2. this is what's he doing bringing on a
[58:24] kingdom
[58:25] what are we looking for we're not
[58:27] looking for a superman brother abraham
[58:28] said don't chase super stop doing that
[58:30] don't chase supers don't worry about a
[58:33] superman or a super doctrine or super
[58:34] revelation or super revival we're not
[58:37] after presidents or great geniuses
[58:39] that's not what we're chasing
[58:41] see that's not even why we're here we're
[58:43] not to be enamored by those kinds of
[58:45] things whose voice then shook the earth
[58:47] but now he hath promised saying once
[58:51] more i shake not the earth only but also
[58:54] heaven the the because why it's the
[58:56] removing of those things that are shaken
[59:00] so it's removing the loose things in our
[59:03] lives so that those things which cannot
[59:06] be shaken may remain what will remain
[59:10] everything that's the word of god in my
[59:12] life will remain i don't care what
[59:14] happens to you in life that word of god
[59:16] will keep you
[59:18] it will strengthen you it will it will
[59:20] be your harbor it will be your shalom it
[59:23] will be your safety
[59:25] it'll be a covert from storm
[59:30] that those things which cannot be shaken
[59:32] may remain listen friends when the
[59:34] heavenly father sees you are still
[59:35] easily unsettled in your mind
[59:38] unsettled in your maturity unsettled in
[59:40] your spiritual growth just know that
[59:42] he'll keep shaking
[59:44] he will keep shaking because the power
[59:48] of god behind the coming kingdom is here
[59:52] today
[59:53] it's here right now it's moving in real
[59:57] time it's all in preparation to do what

[1:00:13] friends my whole life has one goal to
[1:00:16] become unmovable
[1:00:19] to become mature in christ like paul

[1:00:24] going to happen and prophecy tells me
[1:00:26] that chains await me and
[1:00:28] my countrymen are going to betray me and
[1:00:30] all these things are happening but paul
[1:00:31] said but none of these things

[1:00:38] what the devil throws no matter what the
[1:00:40] world shakes no matter what happens in
[1:00:42] the election no matter what happens in

[1:00:55] to call it i will not be moved i have my
[1:00:58] feet on the rock and i'm not moved i'm

[1:02:23] father we thank you
[1:02:25] for your word this evening
[1:02:28] and lord and we
[1:02:30] had had a glorious time in your word
[1:02:33] this morning's service lord and
[1:02:36] so that we could see where we are in
[1:02:38] time we could see that our lives are
[1:02:40] driven by a purpose of god
[1:02:42] we can see that nothing is accidental we
[1:02:45] can see that you have a direction for us
[1:02:47] you can we can see now tonight
[1:02:50] we can look back over our lives and we
[1:02:52] wonder why did this happen why did that
[1:02:53] storm why this billow i felt like jonah
[1:02:56] i felt like david there's times preacher
[1:02:58] when the waves just seemed to be going
[1:03:00] over my head i was just being swept and
[1:03:02] tossed in in turmoil and billows and i
[1:03:05] kept praying and it got worse and i
[1:03:06] prayed some more and then it got worse
[1:03:08] again and i tried to have everybody
[1:03:09] praying and it kept getting worse and it
[1:03:11] kept getting worse and i i thought god
[1:03:13] had forsaken me i thought i i must have
[1:03:15] lost out i thought i must have not been
[1:03:17] elected had nothing to do with that
[1:03:19] friends
[1:03:20] it was god in loving kindness
[1:03:23] changing the direction of your life
[1:03:26] it was god bringing you lord
[1:03:28] you brought us into compliance
[1:03:31] you brought our lives into the into the
[1:03:34] direction that you wanted you had a
[1:03:36] vision for us lord
[1:03:38] you had a vision before there was
[1:03:39] stardust you had a vision of me
[1:03:42] you see me on the other side perfected
[1:03:44] in christ you see me standing in victory
[1:03:47] smiling breathing free air with my hands
[1:03:49] in the air praising god you see me
[1:03:52] standing there lord around your throne
[1:03:54] sometimes i have a hard time seeing it
[1:03:56] but you see it clear
[1:03:58] and therefore lord you're acting upon my
[1:04:00] life and faithfulness to bring me to
[1:04:02] that image i say lord today
[1:04:06] today
[1:04:08] i want to i want to say to you lord on
[1:04:10] on behalf of me
[1:04:12] and behalf of all these people
[1:04:15] bring us today
[1:04:17] a little closer
[1:04:18] to the image you saw of us before the
[1:04:22] foundation of the world
[1:04:24] and whatever it takes
[1:04:27] lord i i'm sorry that you had to throw
[1:04:29] me overboard so many times

[1:04:34] cried out to you and and and the waves
[1:04:36] and the billows just like david i i kept
[1:04:39] crying and i wet my pillow and cried all
[1:04:42] night and how long you gonna hold out

[1:05:00] you love us too much lord you found us
[1:05:03] in a condition
[1:05:04] you you it wasn't
[1:05:06] meeting us at an altar and saying okay
[1:05:08] you're saved see you in heaven no lord
[1:05:10] you you put us on a path of
[1:05:13] a path of development
[1:05:15] a path of growth a path of maturity and
[1:05:18] it's only when we it's only when we try
[1:05:21] to take a different direction or or our
[1:05:23] lives slow down maybe because we we we
[1:05:27] started prioritizing other things ahead
[1:05:30] of our spirituality
[1:05:32] we we went after a career we went after
[1:05:34] an education we went after money went
[1:05:36] after friends went after this went after
[1:05:38] that and it we stayed a christian we
[1:05:40] stayed a believer but somehow it slowed
[1:05:43] us down lord and we lost the time and
[1:05:45] the rhythm of the music
[1:05:49] he bound us up and pitched us overboard
[1:05:52] many times lord we've sank down and it
[1:05:55] felt like we were in the belly of of
[1:05:57] hell as jonah said
[1:05:59] no end in sight

[1:06:03] those billows
