TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sowed under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i now i just want to say just before we begin to read this it's incredible when you read that you can back up to the title slide there brother john and just hold it on that when you read this romans 7 and i appreciate the liberty brother aaron's given me because it would take a long foundation for me to lay but i i just want to jump right in just from what the lord has but when you read this romans 7 it's amazing i'm not going to get into the doctrinal application of who paul was speaking about and where it applies we know that paul was speaking about himself when he begins to say that i'm carnal sold under sin he's speaking personally this is to him but it's amazing when you read this because it's it's almost as if you've stumbled upon a diary of the apostle paul and he wasn't expecting anybody to read it but he was just almost expressing his thoughts you'll pick up on the way that he writes this is he's almost like he's it's the dawning on him as he writes it so if i can accomplish and do anything here tonight i've just got something very simple but maybe i could help you help us to understand us the lord understands every part about us he knows us from our inside all the way to the outside he knows all the pretense he knows all the facade he knows who we really are but this is what's this is what what romans 7 reveals is it helps us to understand if you've ever wondered or thought to yourself how i i know that i love the lord i know i've been born of a spirit i know that god's did something in my life i could say like the woman i'm not who i want to be but i know this i'm not who i used to be and i know the lord has done something i love his word but yet i still even even within that there's still a constant struggle or a constant battle i'm in a war always with myself to do that what i really want to do and if you've ever felt that way well you're right at home with the apostle paul here so we're going to understand ourselves just a little bit better here tonight let's just begin reading again at verse 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but i'm carnal soul under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know now notice when paul uses the word me because you have to understand that can have many contexts what part of paul and he specifies is he speaking of let's pick it up here for i know that in me parentheses that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me nella's going to talk about another part of himself for i delight in the law of god after the inward man so what is paul saying there's more to you than what you see in the mirror there's more to you than what you deal with on a daily basis there's another part in fact there's two of you you say brother matt are you schizophrenic multiple personalities went away you really are brother branham said a man is triune being he's made up of body soul spirit inside of that body is five senses inside of that spirit is five senses your memory your conscience your reasoning imagination your affection and all of those make up who you are now but down on the inside the prophet said but there's a soul down inside of there and that's the real you don't ever let the devil point to something in your flesh and say that's who you are really that's not who i am who i really am is that inside man down on the bottom of my heart that's what the prophet said and we're going to read that here in a moment now notice he says for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and we can say with paul i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then when so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin lord we're so grateful to be here tonight i just look to you now jesus as humbly as i can lord fully aware of my own failures humanly of lord my own weaknesses lord i stand here in the right with this group of people that's gathered here tonight in great need of you lord great need of your word of your spirit lord to come and speak to these people lord and would you give them something that would have an eternal value something lord that would benefit them in their journey i pray that you'd bless brother aaron sister elizabeth their family this church god may you answer their prayers may you set the captives free heal the sick lord i pray that every hindrance would be removed that satan tries to block lord i pray that you would have your way in everything that's done tonight and then in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you can be seated so brother branham answers this in questions and answers i'm so glad we had a vindicated prophet and we don't have to ask questions many of them are answered already for us and so the prophet of god begins here and he asks this man asked this question and if you go to the next slide you'll see that it's romans 7 14 through 18 and bold because that's how the question was labeled and he comes and he quotes all of this all the way down we know that law is spiritual what we just now read and then he comes to his question and he just asks brother branham this question after he quotes romans 7 and he says this i cannot understand so brother branham gives him an answer and he answers this romans 7. let me kind of just polish it up so you can see in me is two persons one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do and brother branham is gonna say right every time i start to do right then the wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interviews this afternoon has run that same thing this morning isn't incredible brother branham is going to relate the interviews that he has people are privately coming to the prophet asking not great deep mysterious ethereal things about the seals this is their question is romans 7 that i have a desire i know i've been born again brother branham i know something has changed me but yet i still have a struggle with things that i don't want to have a struggle with i'm going to be honest and say i still make mistakes i still have hindrances i still fall i still have trouble come on christians i still have issues and brother adam says even in the interviews you're asking to run into the same thing we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we are a spirit man soul inside and that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what god said right so he says there's two people inside of you how can i be born of the spirit of god i know i've come into the a new life i know i'm a new creature i can say all things are passed away all things are becoming new but yet brother man i can still backslide uh i can still get so low in my spirit that i can even question if i've ever even known god in the first place how many people would be honest enough to say i've been right there and the prophet of god said see there's two there's two parts of you there's two persons so the holy ghost and i want to emphasize this the holy spirit by the new birth brings a total change in your life so much that the apostle paul would say all things are passed away behold all things are become new so the holy ghost changes everything in your life but let me say it this way it doesn't change everything they say brother matt now how can we say that are you sure that you're you're correct on the well i'm still living in a body and i had a headache this morning actually rolled out of bed had a lower back some lower back pain so the holy ghost changes but it doesn't change everything i'm preaching to you tonight on being changed so the holy spirit comes in your life but yet there's a part of you that the holy ghost because you only have the earnest you don't have the full inheritance of adoption yet but you have a down payment you've received heaven on earth and that's why you're here tonight that's why you believe the word of god that's why you're attracted to the attraction it's because god's put something on the inside he's quick in life but yet you still live in a human body that's rotting that's dying that still has trouble that still has issues brother branham says that that way there's two creatures inside of you two persons let's just keep reading here just for a moment and he says we we bring it under subjection next slide it says how can i take a cockle burr and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cockle burr has been transmitted from a cocklebur wheat a cocklebur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cocklebur and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right because there has been a life of wheat put in the cucumber and the life of the cocklebur has been taken out notice but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again now i just want to stop here for a moment because you notice that brother brandon begins to speak about this and he even makes the statement and he talks about how that we're made up the bible takes a long time to to we we could spend a long time speaking about this and we're just we're not going to we're going to skip some of this just to save time but if you really think about this you're if you thought you were a weirdo you are i can just go ahead and clear that up for you tonight if you thought you're an oddball or a strange person it's true i wish i had different news but it's very true you're the bible says you're made up and brother branham even begins to speak about this in the greatest battle of her fault we're going to read some quotes from that but if you look at it there's two distinct life forces there's two distinct spirits there's two distinct powers that are always trying to influence you remember the prophet of god says even when he was a little boy he says i came to the baptism of the holy ghost and i was born of the spirit he said but i should have came to that long before i did but there was a spirit that hung over my life that hindered me or prevented me brother branham would answer the question do you believe in that there could be a a guardian angel is that just a myth and the prophet answers and says no he says absolutely that when it when a baby's born there's an angel there waiting to receive that life of that child and the prophet says there's an angel that's with you that protects you that walks with you there's an there's an influence from heaven that is always there trying to influence you trying to impact you it was what led you to an altar or in a hotel room or driving in your car when the lord started dealing with your heart there was an angel that was always trying to get a hold of you and woo you and bring you to god that angel followed you to the altar that was that spirit of god trying to reach the seed down inside the god place there before the foundation of the world but the prophet said also as much as there was an angel there was also a demon spirit that hung over him now imagine that i can't emphasize this enough those two spirits are there all the time even after you're born of the spirit of god there is an angel that is always trying to influence you the spirit of god that's always there trying to speak to you and there's always a spirit there trying to destroy you there's always a spirit there trying to discourage you you can be born of the spirit of god filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and they're still in a spirit that is trying to discourage the family of god he tries to talk to you he whispers to you he's the one telling you all the lies that you're not good enough you'll never make it you'll never overcome look at you look at yourself he's always there trying to hinder the word of god from coming to birth or to full fruition in your life can you say amen and so brother madam talks about a person he says even a person who's not born again and he says they're under the dominion of sin they're always under the dominion remember the prophet says he even draws it on the future home and he draws and he says here's one heart there's a snake a serpent inside that heart and he says then here's a heart over here and there's a dove down inside that heart and he said notice what's changed in the control room of the heart when that man's born of the spirit of god the snake nature has been removed from the control room and the nature of the dove or the holy ghost is now there pulling the levers and pushing the buttons hallelujah i'm thankful for that so he says there's always notice here he's brother branham says there's there's talks about a person he says but a man who's never been born again he says a christian remember he says a christian is the only one who sins right a sinner is just sin there there he says that's what they are but a christian is the one who has the ability to backslide he's the one who has the die daily and the prophet says but notice that man who's never been born of the spirit of god he's just controlled or dominated by this by the devil because he says because that evil nature is on the throne room of his heart he's the one on the throne he's the one pushing the buttons he's the one pulling the levers you can change the outside of that man give him a good home raise him with a good family he'll have good morals you can get him to in a perfect you can construct that man to drive wear the right clothes talk the right talk have an image in front of people but until god changes the inside of that man the devil is still the one pushing the buttons and controlling the levers but brother baron says but when a man is born of the spirit of god the spirit of god comes in and it he says by a fiery experience it burns out that old nature it removes satan from the throne room and he says but it takes him from a place of dominion he said brother matt what's the difference between a man who's born again and a person who's not if we're two people the difference is is a person who's not been born of the spirit the control he's he's under the dominion of sin but when you're born again you remove satan from the position of throne room and he moves to a place of influence and now he's not the one in control but he'll always tell you that he is he's not the one in control but he's always the one there to try to influence you and to tell you to do the wrong things to look at the wrong things to say the wrong things to make the wrong choices and so brother madam says only a christian is the only one who says now i know people categorize sin you know they put pornography up here and then pride is somewhere down on the scale and an addiction to alcohol is way up here and then lying is somewhere down here and then bitterness is somewhere down here you know people love to categorize sin but did you know in god's eyes they're all the same right that's right and god's eyes how god views it it's all brother of adam said there's only one sin the sin of unbelief so you you remove you come out of satan's dominion from what's controlling you and then satan moves to a place of influence in your life the holy ghost comes in and removes that snake off the throne and now the dove is in control so listen to how brother and we're just going to go through this and we'll we'll continue through some of this and skip we'll go back and forth i hope that's okay here tonight but i want you to notice here the the prophet of god let's just pick up the powerpoint if you could brother john he says when it comes forth and he says the i mean yeah when it comes forth and it's no more cockaburra but wheat but while it's here on earth go back to the previous slide if you could that's where i wanted to be and he says but notice the bold but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cuckleber but wheat but while it's here on earth and in the out of the earth and a cocklebur it's still sticky prickly for arizonians and sticky for humid south carolina it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of wheat and as long as you're in this life how many still in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and what's he speaking of raised up in the resurrection that's why paul said we know not what we shall be when he shall appear but we know this we shall be like him in his very image because now it's not just a change that happens in the soul but the whole body's been changed and so brother the man says but as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky but on the inside he says when you're raised up you say to the man when's that going to happen when am i really going to be fully changed brother branham says when the life has fully been developed in other words when you turn 18 for the second time that's when some of you say i'm just waiting to turn 18. don't worry you'll you will one day 18 19 years old when brother branham says when that when that life has fully been developed he says again christ all the sin is going from you that's the thing so the prophet of god uh takes the time here and even the the scripture i'm just gonna stop here for a moment just to pause that if you could just for a moment the prophet of god begins to talk about this and the the way you say how did i how do i end up this way and i'm a i'm a strange creature and i've got parts of me if i'd be honest if i'd be honest really honest with myself i have the potential inside of my carnal flesh to be carnal to not live like not live like the word i can get cold i can get i could get distant from the lord my prayer life can get stale well maybe not in arizona but i'm just going to be honest that's how it is back home are you you guys the same way so listen to what the bible says and you can you can say well brother man how did i get that way well you know we can talk about the the the beginning of the origin of sin and how sin began and in the fall in the garden of eden and how you know the plan of redemption and you know we could we could analyze and people love to analyze and say how am i this way and break me down but brother branham makes it very simple you're made up of body you're made up of soul you're made up of spirit and inside of that soul there's the real you but the struggle comes with this war between what's on the inside and what's on the outside and people who get cancer they're not they're not interested in how did i get cancer and where did it start and let's get a microscope and let's analyze cancer and how does it begin and it talks about a cell how that a cell crashes into another cell and then you know but a person who has cancer they don't want to know how to they how they got it they just want to know how can i be free and i believe a true son or daughter of god can say i i just want to be free i want to have freedom in christ so brother branham the the scripture here the bible says in romans 3 verse 9 it says all men somebody say oh with me all men alike are sinners whether jew or gentile all men all humanity everybody alike everybody's included no big eye no little you no last names doesn't matter all men alike are sinners the bible sets the record straight no one is innocent no one no one is good romans 3 10 and this is the living bible it says no one is good no one in all the world is innocent no one has really ever truly followed god's paths or even truly wanted to everyone has turned away all have gone wrong love how this man professor jordan peterson that you can read you can watch his conversion through his wife's testimony was once an atheist now believes in god and it's pretty powerful when you watch his testimonies he begins to break down and cry and he made a profound statement he said you know the truth of the matter is is that no one has really ever truly been a christian except christ the only true christian was christ no one has anywhere has ever kept no one is innocent no one is followed he says everyone is turned away this is romans 3 10. all have gone wrong no one anywhere has kept on doing what is right not no not one from the soul of the feet isaiah 1 6 even unto the head there is no soundness about us jeremiah 17 the heart is deceitful and desperately wicked above all else who can know it listen friends we're all grouped in this thing together there's not one of us that is better than the next one come on be honest sometimes we need to lose our pride and our dignity of who we are and make an honest confession within me as two people and within the flesh there's nothing good clean up on all three all those halos and angel wings could the deacons go and clean those up no one he says there's no one that's good brother random answers this and you can pull up the powerpoint here notice how he says this he says somebody told me this is he's speaking about the indian chief and he goes through a prayer line and and billy's only taking the serious cases and brother madam's instructed him only give cards out to the people with real diseases and and the man comes up and brother billy paul asks what's wrong and he says me sick me sick and he said that's the only english he knew and he comes through and brother madam says years later the man he heard he was converted and he said someone told me at one time he's converted received the holy ghost and he said to him how are you getting along and he said pretty good and pretty bad if you'd be honest if i asked you how you're doing tonight that's how you'd answer too how's your life how's your spiritual life doing pretty good and pretty bad and he says and he's a pretty good pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty good and pretty bad and pretty good he said well since me received the holy ghost he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them a black dog and one of them a white dog and said they argue all the time said they growl and fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good and the black dog wants me to do bad he said well chief which one of them wins the fight said that depends on which one chief feeds the most so that's that said it depends on which one chief feeds the most so i think that's a good answer listen this is how brother branham answers romans 7. we're not talking about now i know you say brother matt what about the part of you i'm not talking about romans 8 the part of you that there is there now no condemnation which to them which are in christ who walked on after the flesh but walk after the spirit for the flesh is dead that's a part of you but this is the other part of you and he says it i think that's a good answer there just depends i love this on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of god that does it and i believe that's what does it today which one do you choose to feed will determine how healthy you are spiritually and how much victory you have what's the problem i don't understand which one are you feeding which one are you catering to the most the prophet of god says that does it listen ellie says this if you went into a doctor's office you can go to the next slide that's just fine he says if you were if you went into a doctor's office and told him you were sick and told him your symptoms and he was in a hurry let me let me pause that thank you brother brother john sorry i'm gonna i'm just gonna read you something that i have here on my notes i didn't have time to put this but i just want to take the time to read it to you listen what brother branham says and he says a devil is almost this is the greatest battle ever fought 1962 in march devil is almost harmless unless he can have something to work in you remember those devils that were cast out of legion they wanted to do more mischievousness so they wanted to go into the hogs so devils must have something to work in somebody to work through so i'm born of the spirit of god how much access does the devil have to me as much as you give him how much can the devil get in me even after i'm born of the spirit of god as much as you allow him as much channels you open up and avenues you say well i've never i'm not going down to the bar i'm not going down to meet the guy on the street to buy drugs yeah but are you allowing the conscience through grudges or through bitterness or through jealousies and you allow avenues for the devil to get in and the prophet of god says what's wrong with so many blown up christians they don't clean out the channels you're made up of more so what are you saying brother matt there's a part of you that's not the person in the mirror you're more than the person you see and he says he must have something to work in somebody to work through so the devil's tactic comes from within notice what does he use our memory our conscience our reasoning the past complexes memories pains hurts tribulations a believer goes through tribulations if he's a believer he does and satan can only his power he's got is the perverted power of god it isn't no real power adultery is an act misused a righteous act missed you see everything that satan has got is something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today sitting here one or the other power is going to control us i love this so let's cast out the evil one let's take our position like the stars of heaven and he says inside the body is a soul and in that soul is controlled by imaginations he's speaking of the spirit and he says it's controlled by imaginations conscience memory reasoning affections that's the thing that controls so what controls you maybe not your eyes but your temper maybe something deeper and this is what i'm trying to get to you i'm preaching on being changed here tonight something inside of you that's never really been surrendered fully to the lord jesus maybe something that inner man that control man doesn't have the lever to because you won't let him control it then what does that listen from the middle of the heart from there goes forth he speaks of it he says here from the middle of the heart the soul which we know brother what brother adam's meaning here and he says from there goes forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing here with a lot of doubt trying to accept what's out there you're trying to accept the promise of god for you he says but you're standing here with a lot of doubt or a lot of complexes or a lot of fears or a lot of pressure that people have put on you and expectations people have of you come on you've got to stop that and come down that channel with the true word of god what channel my memory my conscience my imagination my affection you've got to not feed it with the wrong things but feed it with the word of god he says then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts as the inside he says satan's approach is from the inside aha aha now i know he's not going to get me down to the local bar down here he knows that he's not going to get me you know addicted to sudden you find me some that there's some certain part of you that's crossed over from death unto life and he knows he can't even reach you there so what does he do he starts like he did with legion brother branham says remember that wasn't his name he was a man had a family a children he had kids and his brother branham says maybe temper or something that he never really got under control and he starts with one and then it leads to two three four five six seven eight nine ten spirits twelve spirits fourteen two thousand demon spirits and where did it start from notice it starts brother adam says there's only one avenue listen to this there's only one avenue that can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency by your thoughts as a man thank us in his heart thinketh in his heart so is he if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you've said will come to pass you could have what you have you get it congregation says amen there's the battleground if you'd only get started first see what it's covered over with you say well well these conscience a man says well this conscience and senses and so forth don't have anything to do with it brother branham certainly it does but if you let the word come in and cover it over with the cover of the conscience then it can grow you see he says then he says if you let it cover it over he says if you let the word let me reread that if you let the word come in and then cover it over with memory and conscience and hurt feelings and complexes then it can't grow it'll be a deformed word did you ever see a crooked plant brother branham says and he says a corn of wheat and he says a corn a corn planted in the ground and let a stick fall over it it'll grow crooked any vine anything that grows up because something has hindered it you see crops and every single one of them straight up and straight up and straight up but then he says i notice one and another place brother branham talks about this and he says i seen one and it was he says it was just grown and it sort of went this way then it weaved around this way and it went up this way and it went over here and brother venom says somewhere in its life a branch had fallen down over top of it and he says and then what happened he says it affected or hindered the growth of that plant now the miracle is that it survived the miracle is that it was living the miracles that its hands was reached up to heaven in spite of all the crookedness and all the branches that it didn't ask for it didn't ask for that pain i didn't ask for that to happen when it was two or three years old and mom and dad got divorced and had no decision coming into it they grew up without a father father was an alcoholic what happened all those branches that that fell upon it deformed its life it didn't ask for any of those but the miracle is it's still alive and don't you ever let the devil discourage you over crooked plants and the things that have fallen upon your life the miracle is look around you you're still here you ought to rejoice and say in spite of everything i've came through in spite of every rock the devil's thrown at me he threw the everything he had at me but i'm still here i've got a desire to serve the lord i've got a desire to move on that's the miracle in spite of everything satan has thrown my way i still want to serve you lord. and he says he says it must be accepted in the mind now notice this and we we're we've got to move on from this but let's just let's just go back if you could brother john there in the powerpoint if you went into a doctor's office and told him you were sick and told him your symptoms and he was in a hurry he'd probably give you a little prescription with some anesthetic in it or some sort of aspirin the doctor is merely trying to get rid of you just at that time because he hasn't time but a real good doctor before he give you the medicine would diagnose that case thoroughly till he found out what was wrong then give you the medicine i'm afraid that's how people have treated uh how sometimes if we'd be honest how we treat other people we don't have time for you you know just take the gospel and that's all you need and i don't really have time for that we just take it brother man says the doctor who do that he doesn't care about you he doesn't care about you i've got enough well people i don't have time for all your problems and all the things going on in your life just give me some people that have that are problem free jesus didn't come to the well he came to the sick that's why he said does the whale need a physician why are you there with the drunks and the alcoholics and the prostitutes does the well need a physician no he came for the broken he came for the crooked he came for the messed up with issues can you say amen and he says he says but he'll thoroughly he'll thoroughly diagnose the case until he found out was what was wrong and then give you the medicine you can go to the next line and sometimes we find people going through these prayer lines out across the nations and they just run up and think that the lord ought to heal them right then but then there's something maybe down in there and we set before the lord until he reveals that that what it is there's something and i want you to key in on the statement i almost gave this my subtitle and just remember it throughout the rest of the sermon there's a reason for everything there's a reason for everything why am i this way why am i built this why does this trip me up and why am i this certain thing agitates me and i don't even you know a lot of times you don't understand yourself but remember there's a reason for everything and he says and you've got to find the reason first and then you can find out what to work on server that matt why why is that i want to just i want to say this because i believe it's so important to the substance of what i what the lord has put upon my heart in case i miss it i'm preaching to you on being changed being changed not just that you were changed one time but that you were you are being changed and let me just stop here and say when when you receive the spirit of god you're changed but there's a part of you that must of necessity be constantly be being changed you must you must you must you can't stop you can't stop and sit down you can't stop and pause for a moment you must constantly say lord continue to change me continue to grow me i don't care how far the lord has brought you in your marriage or your mind or your church or your spiritual life i don't care what place you've ever achieved and what height you've ever went to there's got to be something inside of you that says lord i've went this far but i need to go further i've climbed this high but i want to go higher lord you've got to constantly be in being evolved and changed and cleaned what are you saying brother matt the experience with god is not just a one-time event it's got to be a daily pouring out daily dying out a daily emptying out to say lord clean my mind clean my conscience clean my spirit if i've ingested something that you that's not according to your word let me cast it down lord that's why paul would say you did run well what did hinder you you've stopped be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage wherewith christ has already set you free you've got it constantly brother adam says clean out the channels and we didn't take time to read it brother adam says that's the what's wrong with so many blowed up christians like a boiler and he says you take a boiler and it says if the flu pipe if the exhaust is clogged up with things he says it builds up pressure and pressure and because life has a tendency if you haven't noticed your life as you get older you get more pressure and more pressure and more pressure and he says that boiler if he said if the flu is clogged and he says it just builds up and builds up and then boom and it blows and he says that's what's wrong with so many blowed up christians they never cleaned out the channels brother branham says what channels memory conscience reasoning imagination affection and he says you've got to clean them out you've got to let the spirit of the lord go in there and do a surgery sometimes open heart surgery sometimes it's got to open you back up and take something that you've never really fully listen there is a tool bag doctors have and they could take a touch they could come and and help you and and in ways uh and do and do things for you but there are certain tools that man doesn't have and only god has those tools and only god can come into the parts of your heart and heal the pieces of you that are that are causing issues and if we'd be honest we all have them and brother branham says to let everything it's got to be cleaned out you've got to be constantly cleaning out constantly clearing out right constantly growing constantly moving you can't stop ever moving on i've tasted of the lord but you've got to need more you've got to have more i've been filled with the spirit but you have many refillings of his spirit i'd say give me one every day lord every day i put my feet on this earth refill me again lord so brother branham says this here and he comes to this and i just want to come here it's not a one-off and so let's let's go back to the slides that's that's good we'll go back brother branham says and sometimes we find people going through these prayer lines out across the nation we've read that there's a reason for everything and he says you've got to find the reason first and then you can find what to work on i found someone not program excuse me on the interviews this morning says questions and answers august 30th i guess they're still here in the building about speaking with tongues that person is a genuine person a real person and they've lived right they've heard me say the evidence of the holy ghost wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't notice this but i advise that person to ask god to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy why brother branham because it's the nature now you've just spent the entire service that morning brother branham spends and talks about the evidence of the holy ghost isn't speaking in tongues and he says but now i've told this lady she's a genuine person a real person lived right and he says but i told her i advise you to ask the lord to let you speak in tongues or prophesy why would you advise that person because it's the nature so he's seen something inside of this woman that he knew that the nature that was inside of her maybe you're not that way but she was built a certain way to where until something outwardly took place in her life brother branham knew she would always live in constant questioning and struggling and always wondering so you know what we do with those kind of cases we complicate them and make them some kind of mystery but brother branham is just so simple says just ask the lord to let you speak in tongues let him ask the lord i'd advise you to do that why because it's the nature the first thing i went to that person and found their birthplace ah clue so you mean your birthplace and where you're born can have an effect on how you are and who you are as a person how you view god how you react to his word how you even receive a sermon that's preached and you hear certain things and you hear through your own experience and someone hears completely different than you and one person says he said this no i don't i've never heard brother matt say that well that's because the the filter of that person's history and their past and what this the things that god has had to bring them through they received something entirely different than what you did and he says i went to that person and found their birthplace and what sign they were born under and could tell what their birth was which way it set in their natural nature set them in a certain line what house she was you say brother matt the birth has where you're born has absolutely what house she was born in the mother and father she had the teachers that she had in her life you say that's important oh absolutely brother and preachers the message leadership and remember he says now you started out as a little baby and he says you started out in the arms of your mother and he says and in the arms of that mother you experience the love of god you know what the real love of a real mother is experiencing that baby's experiencing the love of god through that mom and brother branham says that was your first time you came in contact to a true mother who truly loves that baby and brother bannon says then from the mother's arms eventually you you change dispensations and you go into the dispensation of your father and he says now he still loves you dad dad's he said it's still the love of god but maybe a little more corrective than what mama was his brother diggs says every family has law and grace and his mom was a police officer so yeah she had law and brother adam says then you go from there from your mother then you go into the father and he says then you go from the father and you graduate from there and all all of those things from your father is passing down unto you are passed from his father and then things and trade and teaching and principles of life are passed from their father and you're you're taking all of those things in and then you move from the mother to the father then you move to the teacher brother branham says maybe your sunday school teacher received you then or your teacher's in class and they molded you the experiences that you went through the things that you've seen that others didn't see the feelings that you felt that others didn't feel and he says and you you go from there and you move from dispensation all of those things then your employer then your career then your job and all of those things make up who you are and brother branham says now watch what happens if that child never receives the love of the mother he says that void that child was created with a void in his heart you're born in sin you're created with a void and brother branham says if that child never receives the love from that mother a true mother's love or the father and you never really portray the love of christ to that child brother branham says it this way he says then that child will go and fill that void with some violent substitute that the devil gives him and you watch people that have strayed away from the lord because they were never filled with that's why it's so important as parents that we say lord let my projection of you be a projection that's true that's pure that's undefiled let me express the love of christ how many would say that let me project the love of christ to my children so that i leave an imprint not of my complexes and not of my struggles and not of my troubles and not of my issues i don't want to imprint them i'm going to by default already i'm going to but lord let me imprint them with the love of christ and so brother branham says notice what happened her birthplace which way set their nature natural way sets them in a certain line where they're born the leaders that they came under so notice he says then when they're born again they're over here in another nature then when you find in this nature that's the inside in conscience inside conscience go to the next slide it's been one of the most amazing things that i've noticed along the lines of my ministry for our lord jesus is the peculiarity of people and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch nature of people go to the next line and the different parts of the nations and the worlds to see where you go you'll notice that there's a difference there's a different attitude that people take towards christ towards his servants towards a service towards his servants towards worship and one of the things has been that one type of meeting would just be wonderful in one part of the country where it won't work in the other part of the country because people are different right notice how he begins to say this in the next slide you can go brother he says excuse me sister let me just pull it up here excuse me sister i have to relax my mind once in a while now we'll be strangers i see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're far from you're from away from here you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart it's the first thing he sees you get a lot of trouble on your heart and you've got heart trouble to begin with is that right this is 20th century prophet you can go back and watch this and the ladies saying yes brother branham is that right you got a lot of trouble there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheet keep following you like that remember that brother branham says that spirit that hung over him he says i see a black sheep following you like that oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and that man was professing divine healing you hear the woman that sister says yes sir he said you was a witch yes is that true and you've got a whole stir in your church or something another about it is that right your pastor's sick right now he's got polio is that right yes sir sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're lying the only thing's wrong with your heart is that nervous condition got your heart worked up go home in peace and god bless you you're all right god bless you you're not a witch so notice what happens this woman who's a believer who's a child of god a child of god a daughter of god has now ingested something in her spirit through a lie that was told on her and there's a black sheet she had no idea there was a spirit following her and influencing her and filtering everything in life and it was something someone told about her and where did it go not in her flesh when in her spirit and she's a child of god and brother branham now realizes that and something in her spirit is now causing something to be affected on her body so doctors have figured out with heart trouble with stress and anxiety and all the pressure that you're under that can eventually affect your body and the woman is living with a heart condition and it's not hereditary it's not something from bad diet it's from a spirit she took into a lie and now it's affecting her so much she's in a prayer line and notice it's not some hocus what does brother branham do it's not some great build up and some great hocus pocus he simply exposes the devil and you say what healing did the sister need all she needed was for the light of the word of god to shine on that lie with truth and she was free you say what do we need brother matt we need the light of the word to say god shine in every part of my being shine in my memory my conscience my reasoning and expose the devil for every lie that i've believed and taken into myself you're not a witch so simple that's a lie that's not who you are and just like that she's free you believe with all your heart believe god will heal you with that tbs holy praise foreign ask him lord jesus i pray you'll heal the woman may she get completely whole he cares do you care 1963 and then strangely i went to a place where i made an odd turn notice this instead of turning around there i went up to make a turn the lights flashed on a lovely couple on the outside two fine young ladies that i had just married two fine young ministers and satan after seeing the minister one of them was ministry being said and he took a life's companion right there at this altar they went away happily on their honeymoon and the enemy jumped on this young man now i'm saying this to express what i'm saying does he care you take a man a woman here you have a boy you have a girl so they get married two families two lives come together everything that's made up of those two lives their memory both have memory conscience reasoning imagination affection they're both made up of their past their history their home the atmosphere of their home their father their mother if they lived in a holy home if they lived in a home maybe a dad who didn't know the lord maybe mom who strayed maybe a divorced home all of those things their their complexes did the family come through this boy maybe his dad they had sorrow and maybe they lost a loved one through disease or some great horrible tragic thing and maybe this man was from another country and you take all of these things and you mold them all together and all of these all of this light these two lives and then you marry them together and with all of that baggage the devil now has avenues and they're one happily couple and they lived happily ever after but there was always those avenues of this young man of things that he never cleared out things that he never really let the healer come in and heal in his heart remember what brother brandon says if the doctor is merely trying to get away with get get he doesn't have time he'll just say just take an aspirin get out of my office here's the here's the pill and you know sometimes we're so quick to oh you just need the holy ghost you just need to go through a prayer line you just need an experience with god maybe they need all of the above but remember there's a reason for everything and a person who really cares i'm glad jesus really cared for me and he wasn't just there to say just accept it but he said i'm going to deal with you on whatever level that you're at we're going to go through and uncover all of the baggage and if you let me i'm going to heal every single part of it and this man this woman there all of these things and they come now the devil jumps on this man all of those all of those strains from the family and all of those complexes and i'm saying this to express what i'm saying does he care somehow with faith that wouldn't take no turn back return back here knowing that it was all the way over way in the east and he says in next next slide if you could all the way in the east here somewhere on their honeymoon we turned back and was sitting waiting i walked in find handsome young man his wife sitting on the outside crying hearing their little companion the other man and the other brother coming running which is a friend of this young man said oh brother branham such and such has happened went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life a leader of young men sitting there and satan bound him he never noticed but i took my hand to shake his hand his left to shake his hand with his hand right to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting upon the lord the anointing of the holy spirit was there and that's why it led us see and then seeing the shadow of darkness there it is again the shadow of darkness over him i never said what i was doing but in less than a couple of moments time it was all gone the coldness of his hands had left he was shouting and praising god notice a few minutes to find himself he goes on a honeymoon something jumps upon him now there's a stirred brother random doesn't give us the details of what it is but there's this blow up and then in a few minutes in an interview privately brother branham no doubt starts discerning things notice what he says and he says few minutes to find himself and here they sit right here this morning sit in the audience see how satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him of some complex to be built back so something you say brother matt something that the lord has set me free from can be built oh trust me the devil will take any victory that you have any jericho's that are laying ruined and crushed in bricks and tatter you better believe it satan will start taking bricks and putting mortar and bricks and trying to rebuild that problem that god had set you free from and if you don't clean out the channels and if you don't obey what does the word say casting down every vain imagination and every thought that exalts itself above the knowledge of the word cast it down because if you don't you'll be right back in those same chains god set you free from some complex people back which the holy spirit knew and i seen it by vision but god cared for that man god cared for that young boy just coming a few moments ago a lady i seen her sitting here in the aisle with no just got a seat got her a seat some way and sat down she said nine years brother branham i've tried to get a hold of you and she said i'm so desperate nine years could you imagine i'm so desperate i hear laden couldn't even get a prayer card to be in the line the lady moved back and she said brother branham just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman seemed that her heart was burdened and she was trying to work to make a living and a great thing happened back way back in the time of her parents that it caused this great thing to happen to her so something in the past was now affecting the present and for nine years she lives with this present problem that was something in the time of her parents brother branham says that it calls this great thing the lord jesus revealed and showed what it was and there in a moment's time took it from the woman she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience with us rejoicing with tears as she's wiping her eyes now knowing that the truth of the thing was made known and that what that poor little neurotic woman that was so nervous she didn't know what to do with herself and thinking she was gone and there was no holy spirit and this is her last day if you ever felt the devil tell you there's no holy spirit for you and you've send your day of grace away you're not the only person the devil has tried to tell that lie to she had tried for nine years and was just about at the end of despair god cared for that little woman no one cares for what a time he does care when he was here on earth i say he cared for people so much till he healed their sick comforted their hearts told them about a place where he would go to prepare for them and would come again to receive them unto himself he cared for them and noticed he cared so much until when he knew he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i'll send the holy spirit he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's no one cares like jesus knowing that he sent back the holy spirit to continue his comfort for people does he care certainly he does he was to continue to care for the people his people here on earth in the same manner that he cared for them when he was here does he care oh how he cares brother branham says something comes in on this man we we use multiple examples of this this spirit that was following them can i have just a few more minutes okay we're all right and he says something that came in on him something had some complex he was trying to build back up remember what brother bannon says there's a reason for everything as i've heard it said it's a powerful statement that your entire adult life that you live as an adult is just a reaction of your childhood so everything that you're made up all the good that happened all the bad that happened all of the good things all of the bad things things that you should have received that maybe you didn't like love or nurture or care things that you shouldn't have received that you did things you should have never seen or ever had to go through you know i believe that any person who goes through divorce any child who's the product of that is a living miracle it's what i believe to go through the brokenness of a home where there's not a dad or not a mom or there's an absent non-present remember brother branham says there's a reason for everything and sometimes you see what you see in a person sometimes it's just the tip of the iceberg it wasn't what sunk the titanic was not the tip of that iceberg it wasn't what you could see it's what you couldn't see it's what was underneath the water where they couldn't see is what took the titanic down and brother madam says remember there's a reason for everything they never clean out the channels the flu gets clogged up and then it builds pressure and it builds pressure and it may build pressure for one year two year three year four year five ten year anniversary 12 year anniversary 15 years married and that that black spirit that blackness is always there following you notice it's incredible because if you watch and it's a popular statement hurt people hurt people and you watch it's so so so amazing how pain becomes transcended pain and it just moves from one generation to the next generation to the next to the next even the prophet of god would say things like in cancer and he talks about how that all sin uh all is a result of sin and then brother adam says now maybe not your sin maybe not something that you ever did but generations past and and the prophet of god says he says there's a there's a there as we as we read it you've got to find the reason then you know what to work on you watch a child i was speaking with a brother back home single now and just lived a very hard life troubled from the time he was 13 or 14 years old was some things that had taken place that should have never happened by a boy 13 or 14 years old and he grew up and and even even things today that he realizes that he's he's affected a certain way and he didn't understand why begin another man begin to describe how that he was he he couldn't understand himself because he would uh his his wife would begin to cry and what was incredible is that he goes back in his history and as a as a little boy has lived in a troubled home and the mom the dad was always gone and the mom would just begin to weep and he'd always come in the room not really knowing what was wrong but there's mom she's crying she's at her bed and and and and and he's comforting her and he's telling her ally you know mom it's okay and he's i think he's at that time uh eight or nine years old and saying mom it's okay it's all right it's gonna be okay and she's just weeping and is there comforting and comforting and comforting and comforting this mom and then they go through that the life he lives up that way and years go on and he's older and he's 19 20 years old and he gets married and he loves his wife and she loves him and he just adores her and they're just a beautiful couple but every time she would go to start crying immediately he would just become he couldn't understand it he was embarrassed to even say it i don't know why i should never get irritated right you know and she's crying he says that should never bother me but for some reason i didn't understand why was it that i was so bothered by this and i'd never admit it but i would almost just want to say no no no don't don't stop crying don't cry and he didn't realize that because he had spent as a boy comforting a mother and that wasn't the job of that boy remember first corinthians 2 corinthians 12 i think it is it says behold the child children should not ought not to provide for the parents but the parents ought to provide for the children that's not just speaking of a job or financially but it's in every way that the parents are to provide a child shouldn't have to provide comfort for a mother but the mother should for the children and he said i didn't understand it brother maddie says but as a boy he says i was completely empty my tank was empty of comfort because i had given it all to my mom and i said well what did you do brother he said that's all he said all it took was for me to realize the issue i asked the lord lord would you change it would you heal that part of me and he said it was gone just like that nether never bothered me again why why because he's a man made up of memory conscience reason imagination affection two of me it's incredible brother branham begins to talk about this and if you could just go can i have ten minutes is that okay i heard the pastor say okay say amen so good all right all right that's good enough for me i'll take it pull up the the other one that you have brother john i want you to notice how brother brandon begins to deal with a very similar situation and just watch how the prophet of god just answers this question as a man and woman come to the prophet and they ask him ask brother branham about their boy and they're asking him saying what's we just don't know what's a matter with him he's a good he's good he loves the lord you know he's he's been to the altar and brother branham says this in a paradox perfect title you're going to see why here in a minute he says for instance a few days ago i was called in the scene on a little something going on there was a fine young man very fine young boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl on a fine family and this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and just walked away he did something wrong with the little girl and as much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't in him to do it to do what to apologize just wasn't in him to do it the father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire to know what's wrong with our boy now it's not easy to do something but you must be truthful and honest therefore the boy notice was a christian as far as a believer he had repented and had been baptized he had had his position among believers but yet had not received the baptism of the holy spirit no matter how much he thought he had you thinking you have and have in it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensations speaking in tongues or shouting whatever you might lay it upon which is all right i believe in all that but unless your life copes with your testimony you still haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is jesus said by their fruits you shall know them now this young fellow's parents his mother is german no reflection on the german but there is a strain in that family and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare stare you right in the face this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister i've come down the street many morning and this young lady sitting out in the yard i'd say good morning to you and she'd just look at me [Music] i'd say sure a fine morning she would just stand and look right at you an intelligent woman i'd say come up to see us sometime she'd just stand and look a lot of people in church do that too well our brothers are that way notice the father and mother is that way now the father of the boy is strictly an irishman moody high tempered brother branham's family is actually who he's talking about here hi strong this is his this is brother adam's family he doesn't tell that on tape he does but brother billy paul says this is this is actually who he's speaking of is his own family the boy's family he's irish he's moody he's high temper notice the mother's german she stares he says now the father of the mo of the boy is strictly an irishman moody high tempered high strung that's his whole family's like that except one other out of the family converted now in this boy this father and mother both are christians filled with the holy ghost and they have brought this young man up in some and he says brought this man up in the way of the lord and now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along there very fine kid he's been a real model boy at home nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother's family lives close to a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no they know it they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning there's a good church but they won't go to it because it's not in them to say can you forgive me now what's incredible is brother branham's ass they're asked about this boy he has this issue and he has this issue with this girl and rather than brother branham even dylan he just takes the boy and sets him to the side and said no no let's not talk about the boy let's talk about his mom let's talk about his dad because he's a product of everything that's been put inside of him and you're a product of everything that was put inside of them they know it's right it's just not in them to ask for forgiveness or ask party they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes in this father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where the boy stands now i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth he looks at the mom he says now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there and won't speak very independent and so forth irreverent to religion but i said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and your sweet kind forgiving i love this what does that and your tree part of the family tree yet you have received the holy ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet i love this it's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives in you it's not your people anymore what changes you it's your christ that lives inside of you i said to the boy look at you look at your family practically all of them are drunks and so forth i said and how moody and how high tempered and how i strung but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you're no more what you are hallelujah it's christ in you now i said that same thing has to happen to your son it's not your people any more all of the crooked all of the things that have fallen on me all of the things that has been passed generationally all of the complexes all of the things i've ingested all of the things i've taken in here's the news tonight you can be free of every single last one of them you don't have to live with them another moment it's not your people anymore well i'm just this way brother matt i was just born that don't you believe a lie from the devil to get you to accept that to rebuild that complex back in your life well i'm just from this part of the country i'm just i'm i'm listen you're not an american hello somebody you're from a citizenship above you're you're you're you say where's my character come from my father which is in heaven he says and the father raised up said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ water baptism in the pool i know my son has come to christ i said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he's been regenerated born again i'd advise the young man never to marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for her being changed there's a necessity a need to say lord i need to be changed oh that's my message so simple i want you just to receive it here tonight something where a heart would just say lord i need to be changed i'm going to admit it i'm going to own it the first sign of the first step to deliverance is recognition that lord i'm the one in need of prayer i'm the one in need brother adam says he'd make hell on earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in i read those words and i just raised up my hand and said lord let that gentle sweet kind humble spirit until it comes in and changes me then that'll be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he let collects christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of god i wonder if you could bow your heads we're out of time by your heads with me every head bowed ever i closed every one of those channels brother adam says it's got to be cleaned just like an old boiler with the flu stopped up you put a fire and it'll blow up that's what's matter with so many blown up christians they don't clean the channels they don't go down to the inside you've got to clean conscience memory thoughts laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with that unadulterated word of god see it's your mind that opens up the door closes the door and listens to your conscience to your memory your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and lets god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out how many want to say lord i want you to come in and blow everything out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan can't battle against that he says no sir he can't there's the battle there's the battle there's the front there's the fl the front line let's not use some 22 rifle let's get an atomic bomb let's do the job right what is it brother branham faith in his word that's god's atomic bomb it blows sickness and devils right and left it annihilates them it destroys and disintegrates everything that's ungodly when that bomb of faith drops in there with the word of god behind it it blows out every devil every sickness every disease how many want to say lord that's what i need here tonight every head belt ever had closed say lord i want you to come in and do a surgery on me i may not even be able to tell me what's wrong with me why am i made that way why do i a certain way and something maybe a certain something bothers me i may not be able to do it lord i may be able not to go down memory lane and that's not what even what you're asking me to do here tonight lord all you're asking us to do is to open every channel open every door give him the key of every room and say lord would you come great healer and would you come and heal every part every spot every place i just give it all hands up hands raised over the building i wonder if you could raise those hands and stand to your feet raise those hands and say lord i want to surrender it to you right now i've been changed by your spirit but i need to be changed lord i need to clean out every channel i want you to come by your word by your spirit and i surrender it how many can do that say lord i surrender it now i let go of it i i let go right now you know you can do that you can do that sister you can do that brother yes god may not what god may be asking for you to do is just let go of it and say lord i release it right now i don't need any kind of we don't need any kind of buildup or some kind of great emotion or some kind of great explosion all we need is the word to expose the devil and tonight the devil has been exposed that woman that sister didn't need anything special she was just told that's a lie that's what's following you it's haunting you but it's a lie sister you're not a witch you're a daughter of god and here the words came tonight friend and it's speaking to you and telling you that's not who you are all you got to do is let go of it and say lord i want you to come in and i give you every place i give you dominion of every place in my heart in my mind jesus lord i just stand here with every heart lord every heart every head that's about every every lord every child son daughter lord that's here they're your children they didn't came here tonight lord not for any ill purpose or any ill reason or bad motive everyone that's gathered here tonight lord has a desire in their heart something down on the inside that you place there that we've surrendered to to say lord i want to be more like you i want to walk in your footsteps i want to live like you i want your spirit to be projected through me in my attitude in the way that i i present you in the love that i share to my children to my wife to my husband lord you're concerned you you care about that lord and i want to say lord let my nature not reflect be a reflection of my complexes or my past or my family the atmospheres of yesterday but let me project a new create a new nature that you've placed inside of me so that the imprint i leave on those around me is an imprint of christ where there's humility and there's love and there's meekness and there lord there's a love that reaches out beyond conditions there's a love that reaches on beyond sir reaches out past circumstances only lord a true love that comes from christ can look beyond conditions of others and still have a true love inside of their heart for his soul as your prophet said lord that your body's not worth even just just 50 cents all of it put it all togethers not worth much you put so much on it we put it takes so much time to spend so much time to better ourselves and brother branham's lord your prophet said he's not even why are you your body's not even worth 50 cents but you've got a soul inside of there that scores 10 000 worlds you got a soul in there that the devil wants you got an enemy an enemy who does everything he can and uses any avenue any channel he can to try to disrupt and try to hinder he's out to destroy and hinder homes he's out to wreck and bring carnage to marriages and relationships between mothers and fathers and daughters and sons the bible says he's a he's a thief he comes to steal kill and destroy but i've come you said they might have life so lord i pray that you would rebuke the enemy tonight in our life i want to say satan i'm not going to allow you to steal anything from me anything you've taken i'm here to claim it in the name of the lord jesus i take back every part of me that i might have lost in a complex i might have lost it in some battle that i lost but tonight i'd say you might have taken it for years but i claim it in the name of the lord that i'm going to take it back for my family you might have tried to make me bitter but tonight i've got victory over bitterness might have tried to make me jealous but i've got i've got victory over jealousy i've got victory over hatred i've got victory over anger because there's been a new nature down inside and it's not mine it's not my people anymore it's my christ that granted to your lives bring healing lord god to your children may ask may we lord i just say lord as i close now change my heart oh god change every part of me lord i pray that you would take what i can't as their prophet said about the boys trying his best to overcome it lord you see that we try our best intellectually lord but would you come and do a work on our heart that we can't do all you ask from us is to surrender to open up open up our hearts [Music]
