[0:00] or we could say the jewish church ages
[0:02] and he revealed christ revealed the
[0:04] mystery of god no matter how much the
[0:06] jews thought they knew him when christ
[0:08] came he was the very revelation of god
[0:11] brother man said god was manifesting
[0:13] himself before the ending of the jewish
[0:15] dispensation
[0:16] so i'm wanting to look at this in
[0:17] parallel our type for our time that in
[0:19] the climax of the jews his this coming
[0:23] he came in the climax for the jews it
[0:24] was the crowning of what the prophets
[0:26] prophesied what the prophets wrote you
[0:29] put it in this way it was their capstone
[0:30] not in the sense that they had a literal
[0:32] capstone but just in the sense of it was
[0:34] the crown in culmination of the old
[0:36] testament so we could use this language
[0:38] to say the old testament became a new
[0:40] book the scrolls became alive the
[0:42] scrolls are living and breathing
[0:44] and in galatians chapter 4 verses 4 and
[0:46] 5 it says but when the fullness of the
[0:48] time was come
[0:49] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[0:52] made under the law to redeem that them
[0:55] that were under the law that we might
[0:56] receive the adoption of sons this is
[0:58] speaking about israel when the fullness
[1:00] of time was come at the end of the
[1:02] jewish ages
[1:04] uh we could say the fullness of time we
[1:05] think about gentiles no or we think of
[1:07] the end of time no this is specifically
[1:10] for the jews it was the fullness of the
[1:12] time appointed by god something started
[1:15] in genesis 3 15 and that very prophecy
[1:18] of a man born of a woman to crush the
[1:20] serpent's head it climaxes in jesus
[1:22] christ and it culminates the very reason
[1:26] why god called abraham in the beginnings
[1:28] this is the end of the jewish ages it
[1:30] says in romans 10 4 christ is the end of
[1:33] the law
[1:34] i want you to think of it this way
[1:35] christ was the mystery of the law all
[1:37] the law pointed to christ all the law uh
[1:40] was typing christ the sacrifices the
[1:42] feast days all these things pointed to
[1:44] christ we could say that christ was
[1:46] bound up in those scrolls
[1:48] he was he was embodied in it the very
[1:51] letters written in it and that's why we
[1:52] could say even today that when you read
[1:54] the bible you should see jesus christ in
[1:56] every verse
[1:57] because he was bound up in the writings
[1:59] he was bound up in the law and the
[2:01] prophets he's rolled up in the scroll as
[2:03] we've been using that language
[2:05] and so the scriptures were made flesh in
[2:08] jesus christ the old testament
[2:10] was made flesh in jesus christ he was
[2:13] the revelation of the i am
[2:15] to israel that's what we're continuing
[2:16] on i am an open book
[2:19] now
[2:20] this we're just jumping right into this
[2:21] and this is um
[2:23] i would say i don't mean this maybe in a
[2:25] disparaging way or even in a um
[2:29] crude way but this is upper level
[2:30] message uh
[2:32] teaching if i could say that that i'm
[2:34] wanting i'm gonna be using a lot of
[2:35] statements and lengthy statements um
[2:38] from brother branham in the sermon
[2:39] question and answers on the seals and
[2:41] you kind of have to have an
[2:42] understanding of what this brother
[2:44] branham taught um and so we're
[2:46] reinforcing a lot of things that we
[2:47] believe today
[2:48] but to review a few statements that
[2:50] we've used already but since the open of
[2:52] those seven seals this is in god's power
[2:54] to transform he says since the open of
[2:55] those seven seals of them angels just
[2:58] beyond the mountain yonder this has
[2:59] become a new book
[3:01] so he's saying the seals have been
[3:03] opened right because all seven seals are
[3:05] opened
[3:06] uh and everything is ready to those who
[3:08] can receive it so we believe that and he
[3:10] says that in doing so the bible becomes
[3:13] a new book so in referencing those
[3:15] scriptures he's taking what is
[3:17] represented uh as john is caught up in
[3:20] the spirit of the lord's day in
[3:21] revelations chapter 5
[3:23] verse 1 and he sees a book as it says i
[3:25] saw on the right hand of him that sat on
[3:27] the throne a book written and on the
[3:29] backside sealed written within and on
[3:32] the backside sealed with seven seals so
[3:34] this book the scroll is sealed with
[3:36] seven seals when brother brahman says
[3:38] since the open of those seven seals he's
[3:40] talking about this sealed book and those
[3:42] seven seals being loosed
[3:44] and the one that opened it is christ as
[3:46] it says in verse 5 and one of the elders
[3:48] saith unto me weep not behold the lion
[3:51] of the tribe of judah the root of david
[3:53] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[3:56] loose the seven seals thereof so as
[3:58] you're reading six seven and eight and
[4:00] you find the opening of those seals and
[4:02] the loose end of each one of those seals
[4:04] but this is what brother i'm saying has
[4:06] happened if john saw if john was caught
[4:08] up in the spirit in the lord's day and
[4:10] he's he's seen these things literally
[4:11] happen and he writes it in symbolic form
[4:13] it's represented in symbolic form
[4:15] whatever was written whatever he saw
[4:18] now we're where we are today we're
[4:20] saying that which was referenced in
[4:22] these scriptures has been fulfilled it
[4:24] has happened
[4:25] and brother branham says in the message
[4:26] souls that are in prison now
[4:28] and we may come to it here soon on the
[4:31] prophet's prison ministry but he
[4:32] preaches the souls that are in prison
[4:34] now when the these seal seven seals were
[4:36] opened that opened up the entire bible
[4:39] so this is something significant to use
[4:41] that kind of language that now the bible
[4:43] became a new book and maybe you could
[4:45] say that to somebody in the sense i went
[4:47] over to israel and i visited these
[4:49] different sites and the bible became a
[4:50] new book to me it's a different kind of
[4:51] perspective it it broadened your
[4:53] understanding and people maybe could
[4:55] accept that but if you just try it
[4:57] tomorrow at work
[4:58] and just tell somebody that the seals
[5:00] have been opened and the bible's become
[5:01] a new book to you i'm sure you might be
[5:03] getting some very interesting looks or
[5:06] uh or someone may you may have some
[5:07] camaraderie with some people they may
[5:08] feel that they uh have seen the very
[5:10] opening themselves as well but brother
[5:12] man makes this statement when the seven
[5:14] seals were opened that opened up the
[5:15] entire bible the seven seals it was
[5:17] sealed with seven mysteries and in these
[5:20] seven seals held the entire mystery of
[5:23] it this is in november of 1963 we're
[5:25] drawing heavily from christ as the
[5:26] mystery of god revealed you'll find
[5:28] there's this tremendous continuity
[5:30] between these two sermons and he says
[5:31] and it was the book of redemption new
[5:34] testament
[5:35] he says not the old it only proclaimed
[5:38] for the new testament so i think that's
[5:40] important to understand that the what's
[5:43] happening in the climax of these ages
[5:45] aren't the same things that climaxed at
[5:47] the end of the old testament we don't
[5:49] need to come as a sacrifice we don't
[5:51] it's not a one-man ministry there's just
[5:53] certain things that are important to
[5:55] distinguish when he says it's not
[5:57] the old it only proclaimed for the new
[6:00] testament it's the book of redemption so
[6:03] the seven seals being loosed the entire
[6:05] bible becomes a new book
[6:07] because it's revealing to us christ who
[6:08] is the old testament it's revealing this
[6:10] christ who is the new testament but
[6:12] these prophecies are specific to the
[6:15] thrust and the goal and the purpose of
[6:17] the new testament in that christ was the
[6:20] thrust the design and the purpose of the
[6:22] law there is a design and a purpose of
[6:24] the new testament it's to produce
[6:25] something it's to bring it to pass
[6:27] something the fullness of redemption so
[6:29] the fullness of redemption the second
[6:31] part of redemption is embodied in this
[6:34] in the seals the seals are contained the
[6:36] mystery of redemption and we're looking
[6:38] at the new testament so you kind of
[6:39] realize where i'm looking at why we
[6:41] spent the time looking at the old
[6:43] testament and christ fulfilling it
[6:44] because i'm not trying to hide anything
[6:46] you're the fulfillment of the new
[6:48] testament
[6:49] and by looking at how that christ came
[6:51] and fulfilled the old
[6:52] we're understanding this is what we've
[6:54] got to do ourselves
[6:56] and so brother man says now his bride
[6:57] will fulfill everything that's in the
[6:59] new testament quite a statement and in
[7:02] harvest time and this may have been the
[7:03] last statement we used last time as noah
[7:06] moses and david reflected the coming of
[7:08] this perfect bridegroom and you could
[7:10] say not just noah moses and david but
[7:13] he's making reference to the old
[7:14] testament characters and their
[7:16] reflection and their types abraham even
[7:18] to joseph and these different ones they
[7:20] reflected they foreshadowed they typed
[7:22] the coming of a perfect bridegroom so as
[7:25] luther wesleyan pentecost reflected the
[7:27] coming of a perfect bride so the move of
[7:30] god in the church ages the bride in each
[7:32] age was looking was projecting forward
[7:35] and reflecting the coming of a perfect
[7:37] bride we've had churches churches brides
[7:39] brides we've had believers through all
[7:40] ages but there is something that they
[7:43] were projecting towards that's why it's
[7:46] even said that this is the golden age
[7:47] this is the age when all the prophets
[7:49] wanted to live
[7:50] that's because they were only
[7:51] foreshadowing and pointing to a time
[7:54] when there would be those even in the
[7:56] way that paul used that they without us
[7:58] could not be made perfect
[8:00] in these ages
[8:01] and brother branham and that's the new
[8:03] testament the new testament reflects
[8:05] this and
[8:06] i realize now that there's a lot of
[8:08] things i'm looking at and may have um
[8:11] it's at this point here i'm really i'm
[8:13] thinking upon reading it now
[8:15] that um i took what i was going to
[8:17] preach this morning and just moved it
[8:19] over to easter
[8:21] and so i thought no that's this is i
[8:23] could just see the lord building it to
[8:24] being just a wonderful easter
[8:27] appropriate for easter and so there may
[8:29] be some things that i've leaving out
[8:31] here
[8:32] that when you talk about noah moses and
[8:34] david we find that written in the word
[8:37] now where do we find luther wesley and
[8:38] pentecost written
[8:40] revelations chapter two and chapter
[8:42] three in symbolic form but they're there
[8:45] and so you see you see then even in that
[8:47] way that these these were written in the
[8:49] old testament but they're also
[8:50] prophesied of and written in the new
[8:52] testament and we have those things
[8:54] unfolding brother braham says the seven
[8:56] seals closes the new testament and
[8:58] sealed it up
[8:59] so it's the seven says it close up the
[9:00] new testament seal it up and this is
[9:02] what the uh open of the seals reveals is
[9:05] satan working down through the church
[9:07] ages and places each one of these
[9:08] churches in their position and it aligns
[9:10] certain things it's very wonderful to
[9:12] see how the word of god did that
[9:15] so now
[9:16] i can say this
[9:18] when i say i am
[9:19] an open book
[9:21] and and we've expressed it in the i am
[9:23] being god and how that he was shrouded
[9:26] in mystery and the the scrolls were
[9:27] mysterious and probed at and though
[9:29] copied they were misunderstood and
[9:31] though believed and adhered to a very
[9:33] festively by certain people it was
[9:35] interp it misinterpreted and traditions
[9:37] made it ineffective and then the i am
[9:39] became flesh in jesus christ he said
[9:41] before abraham was i am and the i am
[9:44] became an open book
[9:45] but i think when we first mentioned it
[9:48] to you the way that you took it is the
[9:50] way that i intended it that i am an open
[9:52] book
[9:53] and it's when you come to say i am i and
[9:56] my father are one when you come to the
[9:58] revelation understand that i am i am
[10:00] fulfilling the word of god i'm walking
[10:02] in the fulfillment of scripture and so i
[10:05] think that each one of you should come
[10:07] to the place to believe that god has
[10:09] called you to fulfill the word of god
[10:11] and that you're fulfilling a purpose in
[10:13] the word of god and so you can say i am
[10:14] an open book i am the interpretation of
[10:17] this sealed book
[10:19] and is that is that quite a statement
[10:21] you are an interpretation of the sealed
[10:23] book
[10:24] you are the mystery of god we say christ
[10:26] is the mystery of god revealed i believe
[10:28] the bride is the mystery of god finished
[10:31] and this is the mystery of redemption
[10:33] because there's two parts to redemption
[10:34] the purchase and the claim and here you
[10:37] are being claimed
[10:39] and and so
[10:41] uh
[10:42] this uh those are that brings us just
[10:44] right to what's in my heart for us to
[10:46] recognize our calling today
[10:49] now this is um where i'm going to begin
[10:51] to read several things and i don't know
[10:54] if the slideshow is working or not but i
[10:56] didn't have the slides completely in
[10:57] there but i give you the i'm giving you
[11:00] the paragraph numbers question and
[11:01] answers on the seals
[11:03] and
[11:04] um and starting with paragraph nine i'm
[11:06] going to be reading in this instance to
[11:08] paragraph 27. that may seem like a lot
[11:10] and it is a lot of reading
[11:13] but
[11:14] i've i've wanted to be able to do this
[11:16] for some time
[11:17] and these are principles that i know
[11:18] you're very familiar with but i love the
[11:20] opportunity just to go through the
[11:22] breadth of it as a church together on
[11:24] knowing that we'll be together again on
[11:25] wednesday we'll be together on sunday
[11:26] and if uh if the the rapture takes place
[11:30] then we're not going to care that we
[11:31] miss part seven
[11:33] right
[11:35] and so in question and answers on the
[11:36] seals he says and then also knowing
[11:40] that right among you things are
[11:41] happening
[11:43] that and he says i know that you don't
[11:45] see it
[11:47] that's uh significant here on
[11:50] march 24th in the morning before he
[11:52] preaches the seventh seal in the evening
[11:53] having just preached the sixth seal the
[11:55] day prior i'm just positive that you
[11:57] don't see it and you say brother branham
[11:59] that's a hard thing for you to say that
[12:00] i know it is but look
[12:02] let me just say this now i suppose this
[12:04] is just tapes for ourselves and so forth
[12:06] but let me say this that you don't get
[12:08] it and you're not supposed to get it
[12:11] and i think some people just stopped
[12:12] there and they never listened any
[12:14] further
[12:15] but what he begins to say is so
[12:17] important because he's talking about
[12:18] this is he's preaching the seals he's
[12:19] saying the seals are being open one one
[12:21] day after another very significant
[12:23] things especially if you go back and
[12:24] listen to sirs is this the time or is
[12:26] this the assigned to the end sirs and
[12:27] what he says there about the thunders
[12:29] and the revelations 10 and could this be
[12:31] the end and
[12:32] and this is this the end of my ministry
[12:34] all the profound significant things so
[12:36] now he's coming and he's doing he's
[12:38] fulfilling this what the prophecies were
[12:40] so this is a tremendous time
[12:43] and he says
[12:44] but let me say this now you're not
[12:45] supposed to get it so don't try to
[12:48] interpret anything
[12:50] don't try to put your interpretation to
[12:52] it
[12:54] you only get further away
[12:56] so when you try to put your
[12:57] interpretation to it you're going to get
[12:59] further away
[13:01] and and and maybe if we could just say
[13:02] even if you guessed it right
[13:05] if it's your interpretation you're
[13:06] getting further away because you're
[13:08] somehow going to take ownership of it
[13:10] and the real spirit of it's going to be
[13:11] missed
[13:13] and that's why we see the wisdom and the
[13:14] way that brother branham proceeded to
[13:16] preach
[13:17] the third pool in the open of the word
[13:18] is he he said it in such a way to where
[13:20] the elect will catch it
[13:22] and that and then where maybe a lot of
[13:24] things have intervened in the meantime
[13:26] as those who received it by revelation
[13:28] tried to get others to receive it by
[13:30] explanation and a lot of people like
[13:31] that's a good explanation that guy does
[13:33] a tremendous job explaining it and they
[13:35] walked away with an education of the
[13:37] explanation that was somebody else's
[13:39] revelation and they could never get to
[13:40] the manifestation
[13:42] because it was only impersonation
[13:45] in one nation under god
[13:46] indivisible with liberty and justice for
[13:49] all
[13:49] so it says don't try to interpret
[13:51] anything don't try to put your
[13:52] interpretation but you only get further
[13:54] away he says just take my advice and
[13:56] i'll take a prophet's advice
[13:58] if you believe me now if god has given
[13:59] me faith in your sight and you know that
[14:00] the revelations and things i've been
[14:02] here with you a long time and it's
[14:03] always been right and now to double
[14:05] prove it right it hooks right in with
[14:07] the word so you know it's thus saith the
[14:09] lord that's exactly it's proved to you
[14:12] now take my advice as your brother don't
[14:16] put your own interpretation to anything
[14:20] notice he's saying your own
[14:22] interpretation he's not saying in such a
[14:24] way to where there will not be an
[14:25] interpretation because we'll come to it
[14:27] later maybe wednesday night that he's
[14:28] talking about the seventh seal as it
[14:30] unfolds there's still a part that needs
[14:33] to be interpreted he never says it won't
[14:34] be he's just saying don't you try to do
[14:37] it
[14:37] don't put your interpretation to
[14:39] anything here's the key you just go on
[14:42] and live a good christian life
[14:45] because you'll only wind yourself away
[14:47] from the real thing when you do it
[14:50] when you put your own interpretation to
[14:52] it and you don't continue to live a good
[14:54] christian life you're getting away from
[14:56] the real thing you'll only wind your way
[14:59] again away from the thing
[15:02] if i could say this the thing being
[15:04] the interpretation the true
[15:05] interpretation the reality of it he says
[15:08] and all of you so that's real important
[15:10] to keep keep in mind because you'll
[15:12] don't interpret it live a good christian
[15:14] life because if you don't live a good
[15:15] christian life you're going to get
[15:16] further away from the real thing
[15:18] it says and all of you are conscious and
[15:20] know that there's something mysterious
[15:22] happening and it is happening
[15:24] and i know
[15:26] what it is
[15:30] it's been told to you before
[15:32] so just don't try to put any
[15:34] interpretation
[15:35] but just believe me as your brother and
[15:38] listen to how he says this we're living
[15:39] in a great hour
[15:41] we're living in a time when the
[15:43] well we are
[15:44] well you just be real humble
[15:48] all right you think he wanted to say
[15:49] something
[15:51] we're living in the ti he says and we've
[15:52] already told you before i think what
[15:54] he's wanting to do is connect the dots
[15:56] explain it perfectly know what's
[15:57] happening and he's feeling this check in
[16:00] his heart he says well we're just well
[16:02] you just be real humble
[16:04] be a christian and try to live for god
[16:07] and live honest with your fellow man and
[16:10] love those who don't love you
[16:12] now when he says this i believe that he
[16:14] is using a tremendous amount of
[16:16] discipline to not try to say too much or
[16:19] explain things as he was cautioned not
[16:20] to do and that he is saying something
[16:23] that becomes a key
[16:25] to walking in the interpretation or
[16:27] walking in the unfolding or being in a
[16:29] position where you don't miss it
[16:32] and that you become
[16:34] he's wanting you to remain humble so
[16:36] that you can see these things he says
[16:38] don't try to make any
[16:39] you see
[16:41] you do you only make it a mysterious
[16:44] something and mess the real program of
[16:47] god up
[16:49] so if you try to make it mysterious you
[16:50] try to make something just any
[16:52] interpretation and you try to make it a
[16:54] mysterious something
[16:56] and you when you do that you mess the
[16:58] real program of god up now i want you to
[17:00] make the connection that the real thing
[17:03] the thing
[17:05] and the the mysterious things that are
[17:07] happening
[17:09] he's referring to the real program of
[17:10] god
[17:11] in the opening of the word these things
[17:13] that are transpiring so these things are
[17:14] connected together real be humble try to
[17:17] live for god live honest love those who
[17:19] don't love you um
[17:22] you just go on and live a good christian
[17:24] life and then he starts making some
[17:26] comments
[17:27] uh around paragraphs 14 and 15 or more
[17:29] 15 about how the
[17:31] these things that have been happening
[17:33] and he'll never get past it he'll never
[17:35] be able to
[17:36] uh
[17:36] forget
[17:38] the events that are transpiring this
[17:39] week and so he says in paragraph 16 and
[17:41] so
[17:43] but if the church he says you're not
[17:45] supposed to know these things
[17:47] so don't put no interpretation to
[17:49] anything and i do find that a curious
[17:50] statement but if the church you're not
[17:52] supposed to know these things when you
[17:54] listen to it when you ponder it um you
[17:56] wonder if he's referring there's
[17:58] supposed to know it or whether the
[18:00] people that are they're present there's
[18:02] certain things they're not supposed to
[18:03] know uh especially just yet as he said
[18:05] these things aren't revealed yet but
[18:07] it's moving into that cycle he says so
[18:09] don't put no interpretation to anything
[18:12] you just go ahead and just remember what
[18:14] you are told
[18:16] live a christian life
[18:18] go to your church
[18:20] be a real light wherever you are just
[18:22] burn for christ and tell the people how
[18:25] you love him and just let your testimony
[18:27] be with love all the time with the
[18:29] people
[18:30] now
[18:32] this is
[18:33] if i haven't hinted to it to this point
[18:35] let me just say that is the seventh seal
[18:39] i mean that's what he's pointing to
[18:41] this is exactly it's like he's found the
[18:43] perfect way to just come right out and
[18:44] say it without coming right out and
[18:46] saying it and he's almost saying in such
[18:47] a way to where it's like a little bit of
[18:49] a head fake people say you can't
[18:50] interpret this i can't tell you what it
[18:52] is but just go ahead and live the life
[18:53] of christ
[18:56] right
[18:58] because then you'll get it because if
[18:59] you could just live the life of christ
[19:00] because he is the seals he's the one
[19:02] that looses the seals it's his life
[19:03] that's made available so you just fall
[19:05] in love and live his life and you're
[19:06] gonna be the interpretation of it
[19:10] so he says and just let your testimony
[19:12] be with love all the time with the
[19:13] people because if you don't
[19:15] you twist yourself out into something
[19:17] there and then you're off the beaten
[19:19] track
[19:20] just love how the prophet's putting this
[19:23] and it's amazing how some people have
[19:24] actually read this and they got that got
[19:26] out the machete and just started carving
[19:28] their own path with this don't like the
[19:29] seals don't need the seals read it once
[19:31] close the book forget about it and just
[19:33] move on and it's like wait a minute
[19:35] you're off the beaten track he's
[19:36] actually telling us that this is the
[19:39] path
[19:41] of what's been opened up this is the
[19:42] real program of god because if you don't
[19:44] do that you twist yourself
[19:47] into something and you're off the beaten
[19:49] track you're off the path that is being
[19:51] made
[19:52] so he says so every time you try to do
[19:54] it you've done that
[19:56] so just don't try to make no
[19:58] interpretation every time you've tried
[20:00] to interpret and you've tweaked and
[20:01] you've left living the life he says
[20:04] you've gotten off the beaten path he
[20:05] says so don't just try to make
[20:08] just don't try to make no interpretation
[20:12] just any interpretation don't don't do
[20:14] that especially tonight when that seal
[20:17] comes up in front of you
[20:18] just don't try to interpret it he's
[20:20] talking about our efforts to interpret
[20:22] explains things he says just go ahead
[20:25] just go ahead and be just be humble and
[20:28] go right on with the same plain message
[20:32] and i'm reading this all together just
[20:33] to see how his how much he's emphasizing
[20:36] this on the outset of question and
[20:37] answers on the seals now you say brother
[20:39] branham is that
[20:40] we've been the church of the living god
[20:42] shouldn't we why can't i i ought to have
[20:46] he said he's it's kind of what he's
[20:47] looking at we're the church of the
[20:48] living god shouldn't we be doing this
[20:49] and we ought to have this and there's
[20:51] this idea of what it ought to look like
[20:54] and how it ought to be expressed
[20:56] and we be in the church of living god
[20:58] shouldn't we why can't i i ought to have
[21:01] and
[21:02] he doesn't answer it and maybe it's
[21:03] important because it needs to hit ev
[21:05] whatever bias is in your heart
[21:07] that you think the bride of christ
[21:08] should be doing whatever you think
[21:09] whatever our own interpretation is he
[21:12] says no no you remember i'm saying this
[21:14] for your good i'm saying it so that
[21:16] you'll understand
[21:18] if you believe me now listen to what i
[21:20] tell you he's sincere
[21:23] he's he's not playing a game with us but
[21:25] as a prophet he's got to be very
[21:26] faithful to what he has been tasked to
[21:29] do and he can't he can't say too much
[21:31] and if you recall we'll use maybe
[21:32] wednesday night i think we'll come to
[21:33] this where brother branham actually
[21:35] preaches the sev he's preaching the
[21:36] seventh century goes i've said too much
[21:39] i'm gonna stop
[21:41] the next day he records a different part
[21:45] to replace what he said
[21:49] why because he's like oh no i can't say
[21:51] too much i can't explain this
[21:54] and i tell you brother branham went
[21:55] through a lot to come to that place
[21:57] where he knew there was a price to pay
[22:00] and god trained his prophet and
[22:02] uh took him to the paces and the crises
[22:05] and the and the losses so when it came
[22:07] to this he couldn't miss being there and
[22:09] he couldn't mess the delivery of it he
[22:11] had to be faithful to it and he found
[22:13] one that was faithful
[22:14] and god found one that was faithful
[22:17] he says
[22:18] listen what i tell you now this is to me
[22:24] i'm going to take brother bram's advice
[22:25] and try not to interpret it to you
[22:27] or i'm not going to interpret it to you
[22:29] but i want you to i want you to think
[22:31] very deeply about what he's saying
[22:33] because he's saying there's something
[22:35] mysterious happening these seals are
[22:36] opening
[22:38] you you don't understand it i can't say
[22:40] too much but just live a christian life
[22:42] because that's going to be in the path
[22:44] that's that's going to be the program of
[22:45] god that's the real thing
[22:47] and he says so just listen to what i
[22:49] tell you you might be thinking oh we're
[22:50] the church of god we should be doing
[22:51] this but just listen to what i tell you
[22:53] and he uses this example now here now
[22:55] here's a post and we'll call that a
[22:57] listening post and it is a radio
[23:00] and there's warnings and things can be
[23:02] done
[23:03] through this listening post and you
[23:04] could even maybe look at this post right
[23:06] here there's things that can be
[23:07] broadcast from it there's things that
[23:08] could come out of it he says like a
[23:10] sword in your hand
[23:12] it can pick from evil
[23:14] or pick from
[23:16] a pick from the evil or pick from only
[23:19] as it gets its message
[23:22] so a sword can be used for evil it can
[23:23] be used for good a listening post can
[23:25] receive things that are positive or or
[23:28] are negative it says it can pick only as
[23:30] it gets its message the listening post
[23:33] now for instance to the ordinary man
[23:36] there's been so much cults and clans
[23:39] rise up over little outpourings of the
[23:41] spirit
[23:42] until people get all worked up in a
[23:44] bunch of stuff go out and start another
[23:47] little move and you know in things see
[23:50] you don't want to do that now
[23:52] he's described 60 years of message
[23:55] history
[23:57] people getting worked up in a bunch of
[23:58] moves and a bunch of stuff little
[24:00] outpouring of the spirit they become
[24:02] cults and cleanse
[24:04] there's people now that believe that god
[24:05] has revealed his name
[24:09] and who would have thought that that
[24:10] would have been the name of god you know
[24:11] if we had a million guesses we never
[24:13] would have come up with so many hard uh
[24:15] um sounds in the name like that but
[24:17] there's they sing in the name of these
[24:18] people and they worship these people and
[24:20] they bow down before them and it happens
[24:21] all over the place they've lifted up men
[24:23] they've lifted up there's been cults and
[24:25] clans they even do it with the message
[24:26] of the hour they do it with brother
[24:27] branham little outpourings and the
[24:29] people get all worked up in a bunch of
[24:31] stuff
[24:32] and starts another little move
[24:34] and people this is it this is the move
[24:37] this is going to be bring rapturing
[24:38] faith not not what brother branham said
[24:40] was going to do it this is going to do
[24:42] it
[24:45] he says now just remember just stay the
[24:46] way you are
[24:48] and you say well the lord showed
[24:50] no now just be careful
[24:52] we were talking about this with somebody
[24:54] uh last week and some people
[24:56] say god told me so much that they have
[24:59] they have more conversations with god
[25:00] than moses or brother branham
[25:04] he says now look here
[25:06] let me show you something
[25:08] did you know there's ten thousands of
[25:09] voices in this room right now
[25:11] literally voices of people that's coming
[25:13] through the electronic waves of radio
[25:15] it's absolutely beautiful how brother
[25:18] bran was trying to
[25:19] uh
[25:20] give the give the message without just
[25:22] coming right out and saying it
[25:25] because listen what are you saying why
[25:26] don't you hear them their voices is that
[25:29] right
[25:29] they're waving right through here now
[25:32] there's people forms and bodies moving
[25:34] right through this room now
[25:37] is that right
[25:39] well why don't you see them
[25:42] they're here
[25:43] actual voices like my voice well why
[25:46] don't you hear it
[25:50] it's got to strike something first to
[25:52] reveal it
[25:55] now do you understand
[25:57] and brother brandon probably said nope
[25:59] i mean just right but think of how
[26:01] beautiful that is how he's saying he's
[26:04] preaching things he's expressing things
[26:06] and he wants to come around and say
[26:07] certain things but he realizes i can't
[26:09] go too far i can't say too much so he
[26:11] says let me just give you an example
[26:13] moving through this room right now he's
[26:15] referring to radial radio waves or
[26:17] television waves and and how there's
[26:19] certain things and in certain spectrums
[26:20] and dimensions there's things that can
[26:22] be tapped into and that can be used to
[26:24] broadcast and he's saying
[26:26] there's
[26:27] voices like my voice there's bodies
[26:30] there's forms he says why don't you hear
[26:32] it or see it it's got to strike
[26:34] something first to reveal it
[26:37] so it's got to come to something then
[26:38] that's going to express it manifest it
[26:40] it says now do you understand
[26:43] so just don't interpret nothing
[26:46] if god wants you to know anything he'll
[26:48] send it to you
[26:50] so
[26:51] just be real real solid now hold still
[26:55] something has happened
[26:58] and now just be real
[27:01] you understand what i mean don't you
[27:03] so he's asking
[27:05] just be real solid he says don't try to
[27:08] make yourself odd to be a christian
[27:11] because you just take yourself away from
[27:13] god
[27:14] and if you understand it this is that
[27:16] third pool
[27:18] that should cause that should catch
[27:20] everybody
[27:21] that he's not varied from the path he
[27:23] hasn't varied from the program he hasn't
[27:24] varied from the manifestation and he
[27:26] just says
[27:28] be real humble be a real christian
[27:30] uh try to live for god live honest with
[27:32] your fellow man love those who don't
[27:33] love you live a christian life go to
[27:35] your church be a real light wherever you
[27:36] are just burn for christ
[27:38] uh live a christian life tell the people
[27:39] how you love him just let your testimony
[27:41] be with love all the time with the
[27:42] people you go ahead and just be humble
[27:44] go right on with the plain message just
[27:46] be real real solid now hold still
[27:49] because if you understand it this is
[27:50] that third pool
[27:53] he says you should have caught that the
[27:54] other day you remember there'll be no
[27:56] impersonation like there was of the
[27:58] other two
[28:00] so that's as far as you should know
[28:03] now just remember that you see now
[28:06] there's something taking place in this
[28:08] room so now he comes back to the
[28:09] listening post
[28:11] and the scientific the scientific
[28:13] analogy but now he brings it back to the
[28:15] spiritual supernatural happening this
[28:17] dimension this uh way opened up
[28:21] he said there's something taking place
[28:22] in this room remember he said just like
[28:24] right now there's bodies and forms in
[28:25] the room but now he said there's
[28:26] something in this room and there's
[28:28] something here there's
[28:30] actual in this room angel's voice of god
[28:37] if you can't hear the natural voice
[28:39] without something to send it out
[28:41] how are you going to hear the spiritual
[28:43] voice
[28:50] we're listening to the listening post
[28:53] something that that voice of god was
[28:55] striking
[28:56] to sound it out paragraph 27 we've read
[28:59] from paragraph 9 now to 27. now you
[29:01] might make that
[29:03] you might make believe that somebody is
[29:05] singing this certain song that might not
[29:07] even be there
[29:11] but when it actually strikes the crystal
[29:13] that it's supposed to strike then it
[29:15] gives a true interpretation and
[29:18] vindicates it by showing the picture
[29:22] john wants us to draw on this now do we
[29:23] understand what's happening something
[29:25] happened it's got to strike the crystal
[29:27] and i want you to think even beyond
[29:28] brother branham speaking these things
[29:30] because something is there to strike the
[29:32] crystal something to reveal it
[29:36] to interpret it to bring it to pass
[29:38] there's something here he says when it
[29:39] strikes the crystal that it's supposed
[29:41] to strike so elected ordained crystals
[29:43] that this revelation is supposed to
[29:45] strike then it gives a true
[29:46] interpretation and vindicates it by
[29:48] showing the picture
[29:50] now the spirit of god when it speaks
[29:52] through the true word it vindicates
[29:54] itself to show itself that it's right
[29:57] so when the true word strikes a crystal
[30:00] it proves it and shows it it shows the
[30:02] picture it manifests and when it speaks
[30:04] the true word of god when the true word
[30:06] of god is spoken it vindicates itself to
[30:08] show that it is right
[30:13] now that's
[30:14] don't try interpret it don't try to
[30:15] interpret it i i have it just
[30:16] highlighted for me so i can see it the
[30:18] number of times he comes back to it one
[30:21] two three four five six seven times
[30:26] glory that he comes to it he says don't
[30:29] interpret it don't interpret it don't
[30:30] interpret it
[30:33] now in john chapter 14
[30:35] as we read this in our text
[30:38] i want you to recognize what christ is
[30:40] saying here
[30:44] i believe is thou not that i am in the
[30:46] father and the father and me do you
[30:47] believe that i am in the father and the
[30:48] father and me
[30:50] even if we can't necessarily be a
[30:52] paradox how both could be in the other
[30:54] he said the words that i speak unto you
[30:56] i speak not of myself but the father
[30:58] that dwelleth in me he doeth the work so
[31:01] there's the word and the works
[31:02] believe me that i am in the father and
[31:05] the father in me but i'm telling you
[31:07] this so believe it
[31:09] or else believe me for the very work's
[31:11] sake
[31:13] now you could just believe him because
[31:14] he says it the father is in me he but he
[31:16] says the works that you see and that are
[31:18] made manifest are declaring to you
[31:21] something
[31:22] because it's this is following on
[31:24] show us the father and we'll be happy
[31:26] have i been so long with you that you
[31:28] don't
[31:28] you don't know who i am when you've seen
[31:30] me you've seen the father
[31:32] and he says have i been i've been
[31:35] witness i've been with you a long time
[31:36] you've seen my manner of life you've
[31:38] seen my burden you know my conversation
[31:40] you know how i treat people you know how
[31:41] i live you know how humble i am
[31:43] you know the love that i have for people
[31:45] you've seen my life if you've seen my
[31:48] life you've seen the father so then he
[31:50] brings it to this verily verily i said
[31:52] to you he that believeth on me the works
[31:54] that i do shall he do also
[31:56] that's a mouthful
[31:58] he says the father in me that does the
[32:00] works and then he says this and greater
[32:04] work than these shall he do because i go
[32:06] unto my father
[32:08] that's that's that's prophecy of the end
[32:10] time these greater works now he says
[32:12] believe me when i tell you or believe
[32:15] the works
[32:17] in other words the works of christ
[32:20] well maybe there's a little bit of a
[32:22] jump here but it's retiring on the first
[32:24] four parts the works of christ
[32:26] interpreted the written word amen
[32:29] brother adam said jesus is life
[32:31] interpreted
[32:33] it's the life that interpreted it's not
[32:35] it's not so much the sermon on the mount
[32:37] it's not so much
[32:38] the parables but his life jesus's life
[32:41] interpreted because he says believe me
[32:45] for the very work's sake a work is a
[32:47] deed or a labor
[32:49] it's even used in the sense of business
[32:50] i must be about my father's business i
[32:52] must be about his employment but a work
[32:55] is also used in this sense of a deed of
[32:57] labor or something that's being done a
[32:58] business or employment but it's also the
[33:00] product that is accomplished
[33:03] look at the product look what's accompli
[33:05] look at the fruits of my life believe me
[33:07] for my product
[33:10] believe me for what's coming out of this
[33:12] the accomplish what's being accomplished
[33:14] and brother branham says he was the word
[33:16] made manifest
[33:18] he was god's interpretation of the word
[33:23] because he said search the scriptures
[33:24] for in them you think you have eternal
[33:26] life and they are they that testify of
[33:29] me there you are he was the
[33:31] interpretation of the word
[33:35] so when he makes reference to his works
[33:37] or else believe me for the very work's
[33:39] sake because the works were interpreting
[33:42] the written word
[33:43] they had their scrolls he said search
[33:45] the scriptures this day this scripture
[33:47] is fulfilled in your ears search the
[33:49] scriptures for in them you believe you
[33:50] have eternal life they are they that
[33:51] testify of me he was god's
[33:53] interpretation of the written word he
[33:56] says he was the interpretation of the
[33:58] word
[34:00] now in the message doors and door
[34:02] preached in flagstaff
[34:03] praise the lord that's where i was born
[34:06] he says he interprets his own words
[34:08] on april 16th he interprets his own
[34:11] words by making it live and vindicating
[34:14] it to be so
[34:16] you catch that it's worth writing down
[34:18] he interprets his own words by making it
[34:21] live and vindicating it to be so
[34:25] don't try to interpret anything don't
[34:26] put your own interpretation to it you
[34:28] only get further away don't put your own
[34:29] interpretation on anything so don't put
[34:30] no interpretation on anything just don't
[34:32] try to make no interpretation just don't
[34:33] try to interpret it so just don't turn
[34:35] up in nothing because god interprets his
[34:37] own word by making it live
[34:40] so just live a christian life just be
[34:42] humble love everybody live humble live
[34:45] live live live live live
[34:48] because god interprets his own word by
[34:50] making it live and vindicating it to be
[34:53] so
[34:54] just as christ's life interpreted the
[34:57] written word now that the seals are
[34:59] being opened the bible's becoming a new
[35:01] book he's saying that don't put any
[35:03] interpretation to it but as he continues
[35:05] to preach through 63 64 and 65 he's
[35:08] saying god interprets his word by
[35:10] bringing it to pass the manifestation is
[35:12] the vindication of the interpretation
[35:14] he's bringing it to we've got to realize
[35:16] this god interprets his word by making
[35:18] it live
[35:19] god said let there be light what does
[35:20] that mean the light shining that's what
[35:22] it means when god says let it be and it
[35:24] is that's the interpretation of what god
[35:26] said
[35:27] and i want you to think of this this is
[35:29] something that i i've just been
[35:30] pondering lately that's been really
[35:32] thrilling me that that the speaking that
[35:35] in the beginning god said that's divine
[35:39] the dysfunction of speech to clearly
[35:41] articulate a purpose and an ambition
[35:45] that has thought and it's caught let
[35:48] there be light that's divine
[35:51] so he interprets his own word by making
[35:52] him live and vindicate it to be so so he
[35:54] says my works testify the father
[35:57] my what i'm doing is interpreting the
[35:59] written word so the written word says a
[36:01] lot of stuff about the messiah
[36:03] and israel has all their thoughts on who
[36:06] the messiah ought to be and what he
[36:07] ought to look like but now he's actually
[36:10] interpreting the prophets
[36:13] so then you come to the forerunner and i
[36:15] love using this example because the
[36:16] forerunner now is very close he's very
[36:19] near the bridegroom he's the friend of
[36:21] the bridegroom and he even makes the
[36:23] declaration that thus my joy is
[36:25] fulfilled
[36:28] and he's happy to see the messiah with
[36:30] the people his own followers moving from
[36:32] the prophet to his prophecy he wasn't
[36:35] this was something he was glad to
[36:36] introduce and declare behold the lamb of
[36:38] god that takes away the sins of the
[36:40] world follow him
[36:42] and many of his followers did
[36:44] but now john goes into prison
[36:47] and this is even a prophet's prison
[36:49] ministry this is his conjectures his
[36:51] thoughts his wrestling with the
[36:52] consequences now that some time has gone
[36:55] by
[36:56] john had heard and prisoned the works of
[36:58] christ now having read john 14 and these
[37:00] other things and knowing what we know
[37:02] we'd be like yes
[37:04] he heard he's got to be so happy
[37:07] right like this prophet must just be in
[37:09] there going you know what i don't care
[37:11] where i'm at i don't care what happens
[37:13] i've done it i've done good i wasn't
[37:14] just a runner i was a forerunner
[37:17] and he must have been so happy
[37:19] and he sent just two of his disciples he
[37:22] sent two of his disciples and said unto
[37:23] him
[37:24] art thou he that should come or do we
[37:26] look for another
[37:28] that's staggering
[37:30] i mean that really i want it to really
[37:32] get in your face
[37:34] that the forerunner john the baptist the
[37:36] one who saw these things prophesied
[37:39] these things announced these things the
[37:40] very forerunner is now saying well maybe
[37:44] i was building a platform for somebody
[37:45] else and maybe he's not the one and
[37:47] maybe there's another and i'm not so
[37:49] sure i'm not i just don't i'm just not
[37:51] quite sure how this is unfolding how
[37:53] this is happening
[37:56] this is the question that the prophet
[37:57] has
[37:58] and jesus answered and said to them go
[38:00] and show john again
[38:02] those things which you do here and see
[38:05] blind receive their sight in a lame walk
[38:07] the lepers are cleansed the death here
[38:08] the dead are raised up and the poor have
[38:10] the gospel preached to them
[38:12] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[38:15] offended in
[38:16] me he says this because the
[38:20] interpretation was incongruent with the
[38:22] expectation
[38:24] it didn't it didn't fit
[38:27] now we're not just talking about you
[38:29] know the the the orthodox who are
[38:31] twisting their curls right
[38:33] and the jews that were pulling on their
[38:35] beard or whatever
[38:36] it wasn't the sadducees and the
[38:38] pharisees it was john the baptist who
[38:41] bypassed all the systems that foreign
[38:44] jesus christ jesus is saying he's
[38:47] offended
[38:50] he's identifying that john had an
[38:53] expectation according to the prophecy
[38:56] and the living interpretation of the
[38:58] prophecy didn't match his expectation
[39:00] they're
[39:01] discouraged
[39:03] if you want to listen to some very
[39:05] detailed things that brother branham
[39:06] says about it listen in 61 april 25th
[39:09] forgotten beatitude
[39:11] brother brown really gets into the
[39:12] thought process of them and it's
[39:14] remarkable it's striking how precise
[39:17] brother branham is about the feelings of
[39:18] john he says but he found out the works
[39:20] of jesus he was meek and lowly so it
[39:23] worried him he didn't know what to say
[39:26] he thought maybe something went wrong
[39:29] he's the messiah shouldn't he ought he
[39:31] shouldn't what this should be happening
[39:33] that should be happening but it was meek
[39:35] and lowly it was just real humble just
[39:38] real solid
[39:42] the works of christ were simple
[39:45] humble
[39:46] the ministry
[39:48] was very unexpected
[39:52] they
[39:52] the idea even to the scale that maybe
[39:55] some would have thought that the gift of
[39:57] healing ought to be made manifest
[39:59] where shouldn't he be emptying out
[40:01] hospitals shouldn't everyone at the pull
[40:02] of bethesda been healed but no it was
[40:04] just it was
[40:06] he's hanging out with publicans and and
[40:08] he's
[40:09] teaching things and he's his whole
[40:11] manner of life would just caught them
[40:13] off guard
[40:16] so now do you recognize how those two
[40:18] scriptures
[40:19] kind of begin to relate to one another
[40:21] and move against each other the works of
[40:23] christ testify of the father and believe
[40:26] me from my works and the forerunner is
[40:30] stumbling at the works
[40:32] he's offended by the works
[40:36] the manifestation the interpretation was
[40:38] offensive
[40:40] so brother branham is going to use this
[40:43] and in question answers on the seals
[40:44] i've skipped some and i just
[40:47] uh i did i just i originally maybe set
[40:50] it up so i would just read through it
[40:52] chronologically in order as he addresses
[40:53] this in question and answers on the
[40:55] seals
[40:56] but as i just labored and labored and
[40:58] you prayed god just worked things to
[41:00] where i wanted to present it to you this
[41:01] way i want to pick up on it wednesday
[41:03] hopefully come to the easter message on
[41:06] sunday that fits right into this theme
[41:09] but he's asked the question question
[41:10] answers on the seals it's question 22.
[41:12] paragraph 233 i think i have these
[41:14] paragraphs marked there um i'm going to
[41:16] be reading all the way to paragraph 265.
[41:18] would the bride of christ have a
[41:19] ministry before the rapture
[41:22] he says sure
[41:24] that's what's going on right now
[41:26] it is the message of the hour
[41:28] the bride of christ sure she consists of
[41:31] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[41:34] and pastors
[41:36] that's the bride of christ now i know
[41:39] that uh
[41:40] maybe apostles prophets teaches
[41:41] evangelism pastors want to say glory to
[41:43] god stop there
[41:45] but there's more to it
[41:47] that's the bride of christ it's
[41:48] important for him to say that knowing
[41:50] what people would do with the message
[41:51] later so
[41:52] i i believe the prophet's not just
[41:53] stumbling on these things but this is
[41:55] the spirit of god leading him to be very
[41:57] precise yes the bride has a ministry and
[41:59] it it includes
[42:01] actual gifts according to ephesians 4.
[42:04] that's the bride of christ sure and then
[42:06] he's continuing he's still answering the
[42:07] question he goes all the way to
[42:08] paragraph 265 to answer the question
[42:10] she's got a ministry a great ministry
[42:13] it's the minister of the hour
[42:15] it'll be so humble
[42:18] and and maybe the minister should read
[42:20] to that part at least right before they
[42:22] stop and say praise the lord it'll be so
[42:24] humble now remember how many was here
[42:27] last sunday
[42:30] got some people raised their hands
[42:31] brother branham asked that for the
[42:32] people there
[42:34] how many were there on the 17th when he
[42:36] preached
[42:37] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[42:38] revealing himself in the same so he's
[42:40] wanting to bring this thought up again
[42:42] about simplicity it'll be so humble
[42:45] remember god hiding himself with
[42:46] simplicity humility
[42:48] humble simple
[42:50] he says remember what i preached on
[42:52] humility oh don't forget that i'm going
[42:55] to stop a minute to warn that again
[42:58] remember when god predicts anything
[43:00] great to happen why is he saying this
[43:01] because the bride's gonna have a great
[43:02] ministry
[43:04] so he says when god predicts anything
[43:05] great to happen the people are looking
[43:06] so far away by their wisdom till they
[43:09] miss what happens i can draw from the
[43:11] fifth seal the sixth seal the seventh
[43:13] seal question um and uh the
[43:16] uh
[43:18] the breach and even god hiding himself
[43:20] simplicity where brother-in-law touches
[43:21] kind of on this similar thought
[43:23] they're looking so far by their wisdom
[43:25] they miss what happens god when god says
[43:28] anything is great the world laughs at it
[43:31] god says that's great and the world's
[43:32] like he says that bunch of ignoramuses
[43:34] he said that's what the world says
[43:36] the world looks at what god calls great
[43:38] and they say it's just a bunch of
[43:39] ignoramuses that's right but when the
[43:41] great world and the great high church
[43:43] said boy that's glorious god says a
[43:45] bunch of ignoramuses
[43:47] right you know tit for tat there there's
[43:49] so he's saying and this ignoramus is
[43:51] just it's no good it's it's dope dopey
[43:55] it's simple it there's nothing to it
[43:57] there's no wisdom there's no power
[43:59] behind it however each one they say oh
[44:01] this is great this is great and god's
[44:03] saying no it's not
[44:04] but when god says something great the
[44:06] world's like no that's not it he goes i
[44:08] don't mean it maybe of that way exactly
[44:10] that way but that's the way it is so we
[44:11] get his thought maybe if it's not
[44:13] exactly god calling people ignoramuses
[44:15] or the world calling god's things
[44:16] ignoramuses but he's just saying there's
[44:17] this derision
[44:19] and this criticism about what god does
[44:22] look here was a great holy orthodox
[44:25] church
[44:26] now
[44:28] the time is very very great we're doing
[44:31] really good on time
[44:34] so that means we might want to get
[44:35] another bottle of water ready
[44:38] because we're at home now we don't have
[44:39] to leave
[44:41] you all showed up thinking there was
[44:42] going to be a business meeting today
[44:43] that we were going to be here to at
[44:44] least for anyways
[44:46] thank god for uber eats
[44:48] if necessary he says here was a great
[44:51] holy orthodox church now listen to what
[44:54] he says because this is so important the
[44:55] bride's gonna have a great ministry
[44:57] remember what he just said in paragraph
[44:59] 26 to 27 or 9-27
[45:02] we know the word we've got schools and
[45:04] we've got seminaries we've got our men
[45:05] so polished why for hundreds of years
[45:07] we've been loyal to jehovah
[45:10] we are the church we're the sanhedrin we
[45:11] got the council churches here both
[45:13] pharisees sadducees and all the
[45:14] denominations gathers up together he
[45:17] says like we're getting so now he's
[45:19] bringing
[45:20] he's showing the gathering together the
[45:22] collection in jesus day the type of
[45:25] today he says like we're getting we're
[45:26] all in the council church where are the
[45:29] big shots we know that scripture watch
[45:31] some little ignorant guy down there on
[45:33] the river with the beard hanging over
[45:34] his face and a piece of sheepskin
[45:36] telling us
[45:37] was he referring to
[45:39] john the baptist
[45:40] certainly they wouldn't listen to it but
[45:42] the bible said in malachi 3 the third
[45:45] chapter i'll send my messenger before my
[45:47] face to prepare the way for me
[45:49] 712 years before there the great prophet
[45:51] isaiah stood there and said so now
[45:53] malachi said isaiah said there'll be a
[45:54] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[45:56] prepare the way of the lord and make his
[45:57] path straight that's right oh many of
[46:00] them said every high place will be
[46:01] brought down oh they said are you
[46:03] listening this is what they said when
[46:05] this man comes he'll point his finger
[46:07] and he'll move mountains
[46:09] and all the low places the ditches will
[46:10] be brought up and all the rough places
[46:12] will be smoothed out brother we'll plant
[46:13] corn in every field around here and oh
[46:15] we're going to do great things when this
[46:17] man comes
[46:21] they were expecting god to take the
[46:23] crank and turn it on bring the corridor
[46:25] down say come on down you great
[46:26] forerunner of my messiah and then as
[46:28] soon as he's done they pull it back up
[46:30] his ministry is over they crank it down
[46:31] again and put it right down here beside
[46:33] the seminary and say all right my
[46:35] beloved son walk down and tell them
[46:38] this is what they're expecting
[46:39] whether it be the forerunner or the
[46:41] actual messiah himself they have these
[46:43] great expectations of what the ministry
[46:46] is supposed to look like both forerunner
[46:48] and that which comes after it
[46:50] he says look when he come by
[46:52] whatever happened
[46:54] here came a man that knowed none of
[46:55] their schools didn't even have a
[46:56] fellowship card didn't have any
[46:57] credentials no nobody ever knew he ever
[47:00] went to school a day in his life
[47:03] and we'll skip some for time's sake
[47:06] and he begins to describe the ministry
[47:07] of john
[47:08] he used acts laid to the root of the
[47:10] tree and the vipers and he uses this
[47:12] language and how we dress and how we act
[47:14] a wilderness person
[47:16] and he was cut completely out of the the
[47:18] present day mold
[47:20] of what they would expect of the messiah
[47:22] suddenly he'll come to his temple and
[47:24] and to be of a certain lineage a
[47:26] prestige
[47:28] and brother bram describes the ministry
[47:30] of the forerunner and he says god in
[47:32] simplicity working
[47:34] in simplicity
[47:39] then
[47:40] paragraph 248 god in simplicity work and
[47:42] simplicity then the first thing you know
[47:45] he's standing there one day here's john
[47:47] the baptist he's standing there one day
[47:48] and he said yes he's standing in your
[47:50] midst
[47:52] he was so sure he was that runner and
[47:55] again i'm i'm i don't i'm wanting to
[47:57] preach a sermon entitled along the lines
[48:00] of was he a runner or a forerunner
[48:05] because if we're not careful we've made
[48:06] brother brown out just to be a runner
[48:11] i had something to chew on
[48:12] i believe he was a forerunner
[48:15] but let's not make him a runner
[48:17] but he does say he was that runner the
[48:19] forerunner he knowed who he was that's
[48:22] the reason he could shake the height off
[48:23] of him he said now don't tremble but
[48:25] just go ahead and continue on this is
[48:27] what he says
[48:29] listen what he's telling him don't
[48:30] tremble just go ahead and continue on
[48:32] you soldiers you obey your masters and
[48:34] if you've done any evil you take that
[48:36] what shall we do shall we quit doing
[48:38] this shall we stop doing this he said
[48:40] just go on like you are continue on
[48:42] continue on go ahead if you're raising
[48:44] potatoes raise them
[48:46] right he's saying this is what john the
[48:48] baptist said in his first coming
[48:50] you soldiers don't do no violence you do
[48:52] this and whatever it be just continue on
[48:54] as your obey your masters and so forth
[48:56] rabbi what should we do just continue on
[48:58] as you are
[48:59] but there's one in your midst that you
[49:01] don't know where that sounds really
[49:04] familiar
[49:05] where did we just read about this
[49:08] he realized the language he's using
[49:11] he's dramatizing it through john the
[49:12] baptist there's one in your myths that
[49:14] you don't know
[49:15] he knew the mess hour of his message he
[49:17] knew he was to introduce that person he
[49:19] knew he was there
[49:21] one in your midst you don't see him
[49:22] things are gonna going on you know
[49:24] nothing about
[49:26] there's something going to happen
[49:28] let me just find it where he says
[49:30] earlier
[49:32] there's something here
[49:35] something happening
[49:37] he's using the same language earlier but
[49:39] now he's bringing up the context of the
[49:40] forerunner john the baptist he says
[49:44] there's something going to happen he
[49:45] says you see and he will be here and
[49:47] i'll know him and finally one day he
[49:48] said behold there is there's the lamb of
[49:52] god that takes away the sin of the world
[49:54] and he said now you have to catch this
[49:56] part this is very very important my
[49:59] time's up now i've introduced you to him
[50:01] i must decrease now i must go off the
[50:03] scene he'll take over from here the
[50:06] millennium will be right on away the
[50:08] time is at hand
[50:10] this is what john was saying
[50:14] the language to me is so uh direct so
[50:16] precise even as brother branham used the
[50:18] same things about himself
[50:20] how he must decrease
[50:22] i must decrease so he can increase and
[50:24] now this is the thoughts of john the
[50:26] baptist i'm done my time's up i've
[50:28] introduced him i gotta decrease i must
[50:29] go off the scene he'll take over from
[50:31] here and the millennium will be on right
[50:33] away the time is at hand so this is what
[50:35] john's expectation was
[50:37] then when he come john said he's good
[50:39] and this is john i'm just going to
[50:40] dramatize it john's over there whoo he's
[50:42] going to shuck the height off
[50:44] he's going to separate the wheat from
[50:45] the chaff he's going to burn it up he's
[50:47] going to thoroughly purge his floors
[50:48] with the fan in his hand because john's
[50:50] just like oh he's going to get him
[50:52] you're going to get what's coming to you
[50:54] you just wait till my messiah shows up
[50:56] he's gonna get you i mean he was excited
[50:58] about it right
[51:00] and he says but what was he
[51:02] little bitty
[51:03] so brother says little bitty it's a
[51:04] fragment
[51:06] now they had all drawed up and john the
[51:08] baptist is guilty as well according to
[51:10] what brother ram saying he will have a
[51:12] spear that will reach a mile long he'll
[51:14] stand back over here in palestine just
[51:16] stand up there in one of those little
[51:17] white clouds and pick up all these
[51:18] romans like this and cast them into hell
[51:20] just keep on doing that till he gets
[51:22] them all over
[51:23] why they had it all fixed up
[51:26] a messiah with a i've never come across
[51:28] in all the commentaries i've read maybe
[51:30] i need to ask some of my uh jewish
[51:32] lawyer friends i
[51:33] talk to your rabbis i want to know about
[51:34] this mile-long spirit
[51:37] i just pick up all the romans and flip
[51:39] them over into hell he says what it was
[51:41] was a little lamb
[51:43] come moving out among them meek and
[51:46] gentle
[51:47] pushed around this way in that way
[51:49] the little lamb speaking of christ the
[51:51] one that was to come after the fourth
[51:53] forerunner a little lamb moving out
[51:55] among them meek and gentle pushed around
[51:56] this way in that way and what does he
[51:58] keep telling us to be humble christians
[52:00] live for god live honest love those who
[52:03] don't love you
[52:04] live a christian life go to church be a
[52:07] real light wherever you are just burn
[52:08] for christ tell the people how you love
[52:10] them let your testimony be with love all
[52:12] the time
[52:14] he says you just go ahead be humble and
[52:16] go right on with the same plain message
[52:18] be real real solid now hold still
[52:22] god in humility god working in
[52:23] simplicity
[52:26] and he said that's what it was it was a
[52:27] little lamb came moving out among them
[52:30] meek and gentle pushed around this way
[52:31] in that way
[52:33] even john said and i'm reading right
[52:35] that's straight from paragraph 254 right
[52:37] into 255 even john said now look at john
[52:41] the prophet he said
[52:43] go ask him
[52:45] is actually he the one
[52:48] these are brother bram's words if to
[52:50] this point you thought i was treading on
[52:51] thin ice i think this will thicken it up
[52:52] a little bit so humble till that prophet
[52:55] missed it
[52:59] the forerunner actually began to think
[53:01] he was just a runner
[53:04] i ran with something i didn't see
[53:08] i spoke of something that i was wrong
[53:10] maybe i was wrong maybe i didn't know
[53:13] maybe something's amiss something didn't
[53:15] happen why because it was so humble that
[53:18] prophet missed it said is he the one or
[53:20] do we seek for another
[53:23] now this is this is a i've read over
[53:25] this read over this read over this
[53:26] trying to understand it i almost took it
[53:28] out just because i felt like
[53:30] way brother branham expresses it um
[53:33] maybe the there's a fragment in here
[53:34] that just in the
[53:36] in the transcription of it it leaves
[53:38] something to be desired so just listen
[53:40] and hopefully it'll strike you he said
[53:41] now he never gave give him a book for
[53:44] them disciples in matthew 11.
[53:46] so the disciples come and say is this
[53:48] the one or should we look for another he
[53:50] says he didn't give him a book
[53:52] he says come and ask him when john's
[53:54] disciples john was in prison so he had
[53:56] been all scrupled up till i believe his
[53:59] pember said his eagle eye got filmed
[54:01] over down there
[54:02] so the disciples came to matthew 11 at
[54:05] john's request after his eagle eye has
[54:07] been all filmed over he's all scrupled
[54:08] up
[54:09] and he's saying jesus didn't give him a
[54:11] book
[54:15] he's done come down to the earth the
[54:17] prophet has he'd been up in the air but
[54:19] when this prophecy was over he dropped
[54:20] back down to the ground again because
[54:22] they put him in prison he didn't have no
[54:23] use for them big wings anymore so he
[54:25] just laid down there
[54:27] but he flew higher than any of the rest
[54:29] of them
[54:30] because
[54:31] jesus even says more than a prophet he
[54:33] says let me show you something god used
[54:34] him
[54:36] and jesus knew because that was the
[54:37] incarnate god there now he never give
[54:40] him a book on how to behave himself in
[54:42] jail
[54:45] so what he said
[54:46] never gave him a book on how to behave
[54:47] himself in jail
[54:49] he said now wait a minute and
[54:52] i'll write a little essay here
[54:54] and you take back and tell john how to
[54:56] behave himself when he's in jail for my
[54:58] sake
[54:59] no he never said that right
[55:02] i think this is a caution on any of you
[55:03] who are wanting to write another book
[55:05] right because that's what we need is
[55:07] another book
[55:08] he says he didn't say that go tell john
[55:10] that he ought to have got his phd degree
[55:12] before he come out in in his
[55:15] if he would he would have been with like
[55:16] the rest of them he would have been a
[55:18] rejecter john was honest and asked a
[55:20] question
[55:23] he was honest and asked a question is
[55:24] this it
[55:26] could this be
[55:29] he said and just wait till the meeting
[55:31] is over this is what he told his
[55:33] disciples john's disciples
[55:36] and it is remarkable that
[55:39] the disciples of the forerunner argued
[55:42] with
[55:43] the manifestation
[55:45] of the forerunners ministry using the
[55:47] quotes of the forerunner
[55:49] you ever notice that in scripture
[55:52] well christ
[55:53] john said
[55:55] and use john's quotes
[55:57] to argue with the christ
[56:00] oh doesn't it sound like some of us
[56:01] sometime
[56:05] he said just wait till the meeting is
[56:06] over then go show john what happened
[56:08] then he'll know if you tell him what's
[56:10] going on then he will know he's in
[56:11] prison and couldn't be here but you sat
[56:13] in the meeting and you've seen what
[56:14] happened you go tell them
[56:16] so the disciples said very well master
[56:18] and over the hill they went jesus set it
[56:20] on this rock just watching them till
[56:22] they crossed over went up over the hill
[56:24] he turned around the car and greece and
[56:25] said who'd you go out and see the time
[56:27] of john what were you out to see did you
[56:29] go see a man that's got his collar
[56:30] turned around and soft clothes and
[56:31] highly polished and educated is that the
[56:34] kind of man you went out to see no you
[56:36] know what kind them are they kiss the
[56:38] babies you know work in king's palace is
[56:40] not the type john was then what did you
[56:42] go see a man that's been given a
[56:44] ministry with a hook into right into it
[56:47] you know hook right into organization
[56:48] and something like that shaking with
[56:50] every he says then if the oneness don't
[56:52] want it he'll go over to the trinity and
[56:53] with the trinity don't want it he'll go
[56:54] over to the church of god anywhere is
[56:56] that the kind of man you went to see
[56:57] shaking with every reed oh no not john
[57:00] he said then what did you go to see a
[57:02] prophet and i say that's right but i'm
[57:04] going to tell you something you don't
[57:04] know he was more than a prophet if you
[57:06] can receive it this is who was written
[57:08] of the bible back there in the scripture
[57:10] i'll send my messenger before my face
[57:11] malachi 3 and he'll prepare the way
[57:13] before me see and they didn't understand
[57:17] it even the disciples didn't get it
[57:19] simplicity be humble
[57:24] simplicity be humble go right down
[57:27] when god promises something big it's big
[57:30] in his sight
[57:34] now if you want to always keep this in
[57:36] mind i want you to you keep this in mind
[57:39] and when this happens then you can
[57:40] change it this is
[57:42] some of you may know exactly what he's
[57:44] saying here
[57:45] you reach down and pick up one of those
[57:47] little spring flowers that's coming this
[57:49] year
[57:50] or get a common blade of grass and hold
[57:52] it in your hand and say now this is what
[57:54] he wants you to keep in mind
[57:56] but if this happens you can change your
[57:58] mind
[57:59] i'm going to hold this now and see that
[58:02] something so simple has made this
[58:05] and i want the brain that can send a
[58:07] rocket to the moon make this blade of
[58:09] grass
[58:12] you always have it you can rest assured
[58:15] on that and you'll always have it
[58:18] in other words if you take that blade of
[58:20] grasses i'm going to hold it
[58:21] until
[58:22] man
[58:23] who can send a rocket to the moon
[58:26] can produce life
[58:28] and have it
[58:30] allow to have a seed come to life he
[58:32] says when they can when they can to take
[58:34] their own and come to this make this
[58:37] blade of grass he's and he's not just
[58:38] saying
[58:40] using what's already there he's saying
[58:41] to make something from nothing
[58:44] he said then if you if you say you'll
[58:46] get rid of it until man does it he says
[58:47] you'll hold on to that life forever
[58:50] because there's no substitute for it
[58:52] there's only an impersonation there's
[58:53] only a perversion of it
[58:55] he says the blade of grass has life in
[58:58] it
[58:59] it's so simple and humble
[59:03] you see if a man is a big man all right
[59:06] but if he's big enough that he can
[59:07] become simple he will find god
[59:10] but if you don't become simple he'll
[59:12] never see him
[59:14] so you've got to become simple
[59:17] you see where i'm going with this
[59:19] what brother bannon was saying and seals
[59:21] are being opened and he told us just to
[59:23] live a christian life to live simply to
[59:25] be he's telling us to be that blade of
[59:26] grass
[59:28] because that's something that a rocket
[59:29] scientist can't
[59:30] produce but it's something that god
[59:32] produces
[59:34] and and i love the continuity with how
[59:37] he brings in the myth the the ministry
[59:39] of john
[59:41] and the forerunner of christ
[59:43] in answering the question about the
[59:44] bride's ministry
[59:47] because here's our forerunner
[59:50] here's the one that's bringing to us the
[59:52] message and wanting us to not try to
[59:54] look so big to where we miss it
[59:57] and so he ends
[59:59] i'm going to skip to the end of question
[1:00:00] and answers on the seals
[1:00:02] paragraph 425
[1:00:04] he's ending this is the very closing
[1:00:07] statement just in the question and
[1:00:08] answers that says oh isn't this this
[1:00:10] wonderful
[1:00:12] i believe that if every person that come
[1:00:14] by here this morning under this
[1:00:15] tremendous anointing i believe if you'll
[1:00:17] just
[1:00:18] now don't look up for something
[1:00:20] some great big something
[1:00:22] just remember the simple thing of
[1:00:25] believing what he
[1:00:26] promised so he says let's say it all
[1:00:29] together and you can say we can all say
[1:00:31] we
[1:00:32] do not look
[1:00:34] for something big
[1:00:36] but in jesus name we receive his promise
[1:00:41] he wanted everyone to confess it he
[1:00:42] wanted him to say it at the close of
[1:00:44] this question and answers we're so much
[1:00:46] as we'll go back into wednesday night i
[1:00:48] want to pick back on some very
[1:00:49] statements from this even come into the
[1:00:50] seventh seal that night because they
[1:00:52] connect perfectly together he's saying
[1:00:54] let's remember this before we step into
[1:00:56] this seventh seal which the seventh seal
[1:00:59] is christ and the things he says about
[1:01:00] the seventh seal is related to the seven
[1:01:02] thunders related to the coming of the
[1:01:03] lord related to the third poll he says
[1:01:06] let's just remember this we do not look
[1:01:08] for something big but in jesus name we
[1:01:10] receive his promise
[1:01:12] that's where he that's what he wanted us
[1:01:14] to where he wanted to leave it why this
[1:01:15] is coming now to the end of the book the
[1:01:18] very book of revelation the sealed book
[1:01:20] in revelations 5 which becomes an open
[1:01:22] book in revelations chapter 10. here we
[1:01:25] are these seals are unfolding the
[1:01:26] thunders are uttering their voices this
[1:01:28] is a very significant profound time
[1:01:30] scripture but people are looking
[1:01:31] shouldn't this be shouldn't this happen
[1:01:33] shouldn't that happen so oh no just stay
[1:01:35] humble just stay simple live a christian
[1:01:37] life be a christian don't be weird
[1:01:41] don't try to be odd don't be cultists
[1:01:43] don't be clandest don't just run off
[1:01:45] into the wilderness somewhere and try to
[1:01:46] get everybody together and live off the
[1:01:48] land and avoid your responsibilities no
[1:01:50] don't do that if you do they you twist
[1:01:52] away from the real thing
[1:01:56] and just as christ came as the
[1:01:58] perfect bridegroom
[1:02:00] that was reflected in the old testament
[1:02:02] and the bride comes
[1:02:04] as the perfect bride reflect in the new
[1:02:05] testament
[1:02:06] he says also in the harvest time he says
[1:02:08] the son of man so now it's luke 17 30.
[1:02:11] the word living itself again among the
[1:02:13] people
[1:02:15] now this is
[1:02:17] you have to make this personal
[1:02:20] the word itself made flesh in you
[1:02:23] luke 17 30 is the word
[1:02:25] made flesh
[1:02:27] in you
[1:02:28] you are a reflection of this hour
[1:02:31] the message reflection of it
[1:02:33] you live again and notice where he's
[1:02:36] bringing this down to he says you live
[1:02:38] again what are you going to live again
[1:02:39] what are you going to manifest what are
[1:02:40] you going to express he says you live
[1:02:42] again
[1:02:44] the life that was in jesus christ
[1:02:49] if i could connect it back to what we
[1:02:50] were reading question and answers
[1:02:52] and these statements i guess i won't
[1:02:53] read read them all over again but your
[1:02:55] life will be the interpretation of the
[1:02:56] open book
[1:03:00] and they can deny it
[1:03:03] but you're the proof of it
[1:03:06] by the way lawson shared with me one
[1:03:07] time i just can't remember exactly i
[1:03:09] think we're fellowshipping on the bright
[1:03:10] age
[1:03:12] and
[1:03:13] and he was
[1:03:15] why that ever became a controversy i
[1:03:16] don't know but
[1:03:18] he was we were fellowship on the bright
[1:03:19] age and he made the comment to me
[1:03:22] he said it's just like people who deny
[1:03:24] the holocaust
[1:03:26] you can deny it all you want
[1:03:28] but israel's back in their homeland
[1:03:31] and and you can deny you can deny the
[1:03:34] seals you can deny christ you can deny
[1:03:36] the message of the hour but the bride is
[1:03:38] here
[1:03:40] you're the proof of it even though they
[1:03:42] deny it but makes the same and interpret
[1:03:45] it by making it manifest and proving it
[1:03:47] it's the truth
[1:03:49] that's what you're to do
[1:03:52] god interprets it by making it manifest
[1:03:54] and he said every born-again son and
[1:03:56] daughter of god of this age is the
[1:03:59] interpretation of the word
[1:04:01] every born-again son and daughter god
[1:04:04] of this age
[1:04:05] is the interpretation of
[1:04:09] the word
[1:04:11] as musicians as you're coming i want to
[1:04:13] share something just to make reference
[1:04:14] to it
[1:04:16] and i would even encourage you maybe to
[1:04:17] go and study and listen to christ as the
[1:04:19] mystery of god revealed
[1:04:22] but brother branham as just as jesus
[1:04:24] christ and his life was the
[1:04:26] interpretation of
[1:04:27] the written word
[1:04:29] and he says that he he was god's
[1:04:31] interpretation of the word he was the
[1:04:33] interpretation word he says that his
[1:04:35] jesus life interpreted it
[1:04:38] brother branham says now you see the
[1:04:39] seals
[1:04:41] and he's wanting us to think about when
[1:04:43] you see the seals and he talks about the
[1:04:45] book
[1:04:46] and he says
[1:04:48] in all that's in this book the words in
[1:04:51] the book he says that's the believer
[1:04:57] that's what was in this book
[1:05:00] what was sealed up
[1:05:02] was you
[1:05:05] it was only in part what was in part was
[1:05:07] you your story
[1:05:09] you realize that's why john wept when he
[1:05:11] did
[1:05:12] as he knew part of the story
[1:05:14] but if the rest of it remained sealed
[1:05:16] there was always this question
[1:05:19] even in some ways john the baptist when
[1:05:22] he found himself questioning whether or
[1:05:23] not christ was the one there was
[1:05:25] something his ego eye got filmed over
[1:05:27] something was hidden to him
[1:05:30] the words in the book are the bride
[1:05:33] and now we are living out the word of
[1:05:35] god the bride
[1:05:36] is the new testament he said that's all
[1:05:38] we are fulfilling
[1:05:40] the new testament
[1:05:42] thank you so much for your attentiveness
[1:05:43] today
