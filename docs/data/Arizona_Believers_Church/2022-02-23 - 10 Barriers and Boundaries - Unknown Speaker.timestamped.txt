[0:00] that Matthew chapter 7 verse 1, judge
[0:03] not that you be not judged. For with
[0:06] what judgment ye judge, ye shall be
[0:08] judged. With what measure ye, it shall
[0:11] be measured to you again. Why beholdest
[0:13] thou the moat that is in thy brother's
[0:15] eye? But consider not the beam that is
[0:17] in thine own eye. Or how will thou say
[0:19] to thy brother, Let me pull out the moat
[0:21] out of thine eye, and behold, the beam
[0:23] is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite,
[0:25] first cast out the beam out of thine own
[0:27] eye. Then thou shalt see clearly to cast
[0:29] out the moat of thy brother's eye. Give
[0:32] not that which is holy unto the dogs,
[0:34] neither cast ye your pearls before
[0:35] swine, lest they trample them under
[0:37] their feet, and turn again and rend you.
[0:41] Man, you could take your seats.
[0:48] As I mentioned, we're going to continue
[0:49] on the thought of love has limits. And I
[0:53] as much as I would love to go back over
[0:55] some of the principles that we were
[0:56] expressing on Sunday, I just will say
[0:59] that the word defines the parameters,
[1:02] the borders um you know the the heming
[1:05] in and behind of what love is. And we've
[1:08] taken it in Corinthians where it tells
[1:11] us what love is and what it does, what
[1:12] it isn't, what it doesn't. We've kind of
[1:14] been using that uh to define what the
[1:18] limits of love are. that love just isn't
[1:20] going to act any way and it acts a
[1:21] particular way, it expresses itself in a
[1:23] particular way. And we were touching on
[1:27] how at the at the second portion of the
[1:29] service on Sunday, how the the type of
[1:31] how the body when the body says no to
[1:33] something and the body's nearing a limit
[1:35] or it's suffering something. So, the
[1:37] body begins to signal and we use the
[1:39] example of the death zone uh in mountain
[1:41] climbing that you're not meant to live.
[1:43] You cannot live in that zone. You can
[1:45] never get used to it. you can never
[1:46] acclimatize to that lack of oxygen. So,
[1:49] the body uh begins to manifest certain
[1:52] symptoms and what you need to do is get
[1:53] out of the death zone in order to
[1:55] survive. So, those are some of the
[1:56] things that we were talking about. And
[1:58] I'm just going to jump into uh I want
[2:01] you to kind of have that in mind that
[2:02] we've been using this thought of love
[2:04] and the parameters of love. You'll turn
[2:06] to Matthew chapter 22. I'm going to
[2:09] start with verse 34
[2:11] and read a particular passage that uh
[2:15] we'll just take a deep breath. We'll
[2:16] start with this and if we uh run out of
[2:19] time we'll pick it up at another time.
[2:23] It says in Matthew chapter 22 34 to 40.
[2:27] But the Pharisees when they heard that
[2:29] he had put the Sadducees to silence. And
[2:31] it's a wonderful wonderful to read these
[2:33] exchanges that he has with these people
[2:35] who are coming to question him in order
[2:37] to trip them up. And Pharisees find out
[2:39] that he kind of he shut the mouth of the
[2:41] Sadducees. And to some, you know, to
[2:43] some extent they might have been fist
[2:44] bumping a little bit like, "Yeah, he got
[2:46] him. He really showed him, but let's
[2:47] show that we can trip them up." And it
[2:49] says they gather themselves together.
[2:51] And one of them, a lawyer, those
[2:52] lawyers, they're always going to get you
[2:54] in trouble, asked him a question, trying
[2:56] him, trying to tempt him, trying to get
[2:58] him to to stumble. Teacher, which is the
[3:01] great commandment in the law. Now, think
[3:04] about that. Going to ask Jesus, uh, this
[3:08] teacher, this one who's developed this
[3:10] following, this one who's just put the
[3:11] Sadducees to silence, uh, kind of look
[3:14] at the law and if you could, if you
[3:15] could for us, what's the what's could
[3:17] you rank them? What's your top 10 or
[3:20] what's the number one? what's the
[3:21] greatest commandment of them all? Some
[3:23] look at the scripture and they say that
[3:25] uh he was actually asking him to rank
[3:28] the ten commandments. Which one would be
[3:29] the greatest? Which one would be the
[3:30] least? And if you were to rearrange it,
[3:32] what's your top 10? But it is an
[3:34] interesting question to challenge Jesus
[3:36] to go into the law and pull out the one
[3:40] that would be the greatest. And he
[3:42] answers and he said unto him, "Thou
[3:45] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[3:47] heart, with all thy soul, and with all
[3:48] thy mind. This is the great and first
[3:52] commandment and a second like unto it is
[3:56] this. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[3:58] thyself. On these two commandments the
[4:01] whole law hangeth and the prophets. Uh
[4:05] this is uh these scriptures are worthy
[4:08] of a lot more time than we'll give it
[4:09] tonight. Maybe uh the time that we might
[4:12] give it in the next service in referring
[4:14] back to this. And so I don't mean to do
[4:16] it any disservice at all if in using
[4:18] this at the outset um you're expecting
[4:20] maybe a real deep dive into these
[4:22] things. I just let you know right now I
[4:24] just want to pull something out very
[4:26] quickly in this a and and with the
[4:29] context of this exchange and this
[4:31] challenge that's being made to Jesus to
[4:33] rank the rank the commandments and he
[4:35] zeros in on this one and another place
[4:37] in the reading it says it kind of shut
[4:39] their mouths. They they they ded not
[4:41] asked him any more questions after this.
[4:43] In one of the readings, it kind of
[4:44] silenced them. And his answer in one of
[4:48] the readings, they say, "Wow, you've
[4:49] said well. You've spoken very well to
[4:51] these things." But notice how Jesus
[4:53] says, "The first commandment is, thou
[4:55] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[4:57] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[4:59] thy mind." So that's the that's the love
[5:02] of God that we must first have. And then
[5:04] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[5:07] If we look at this, these are three
[5:08] different manifestations of love and
[5:10] it's all the same love. the verb that's
[5:12] being used. But you have a love for God,
[5:14] which was with all thy heart, soul, and
[5:16] mind. But then you also have a love for
[5:18] yourself. You recognize that in this?
[5:20] And then you have a love for your
[5:22] neighbor. And the first love is to God.
[5:24] The first love is for God. And then he
[5:27] says that the second commandment is like
[5:29] to this and it's uh part of this. It's
[5:31] together with this. And we see Paul
[5:33] coming back later and blending these two
[5:35] together and how all the law and the
[5:37] prophets hang on these things. Thou
[5:39] shalt love thy neighbor. But it says how
[5:42] thy also how you also love yourself. So
[5:44] love is first to God and then you have a
[5:47] love for yourself and then a love for
[5:49] your neighbor. And if I could put it
[5:51] this way in the beginning, this is how I
[5:52] want you to start thinking about where
[5:54] we're uh examining this and love has
[5:56] limits. You cannot love yourself
[6:00] correctly or love your neighbor
[6:02] correctly unless you first love God. Uh
[6:05] there's a lot of people that do things
[6:06] for the sake of self and and I want to
[6:08] be me. I want to be true to myself and I
[6:10] I I want I want to be I want to be
[6:12] identified with who I really am and my
[6:14] nature and uh what I feel that I am. But
[6:16] you cannot truly love yourself unless
[6:18] you first love God. You're never going
[6:20] to be able to accurately love your
[6:22] neighbor as you love yourself until you
[6:24] first love God. In 1 John 4:es 19, 20,
[6:28] and 21, it says we love him because he
[6:31] first loved us. We can never argue with
[6:34] God that we we I said I love you first
[6:36] or I loved you first. I was attracted to
[6:38] you first. I asked you out. No, he's
[6:39] wooed us from the beginning. His love
[6:41] was first to us, and we love him because
[6:44] he first loved us. If a man say, I love
[6:46] God and hateth his neighbor, he is a
[6:48] liar. Hateth his brother, he is a liar.
[6:51] For he that loveth not his brother whom
[6:53] he hath seen, how can he love God whom
[6:55] he hath not seen? Want you to recognize
[6:58] kind of the order of this that it's the
[7:00] love of God that is evidenced in loving
[7:03] our brother? Because if we hate our
[7:04] brother, he said the conclusion is you
[7:06] don't have the love of God. So we're
[7:08] we're able to love our brother through
[7:10] the love of God that we have in our
[7:11] hearts. And this commandment have we
[7:13] from him that he who loveth God love his
[7:17] brother also.
[7:19] So to say that uh thou shalt love thy
[7:22] neighbor as thyself, the love for
[7:24] yourself and the love of your neighbor
[7:26] is an expression of the love of God.
[7:29] That you you love the God with love God
[7:31] with all your heart, with all your soul
[7:33] and with all your mind and with this
[7:35] love that you have towards God. That
[7:37] would be that would maybe be a love
[7:38] that's uh within within heart, soul, and
[7:41] mind. It it's a love that you're very
[7:44] conscious of. It's a love that's
[7:45] projected towards God. a love that's
[7:48] coming towards you and then we could see
[7:50] this love then for thy neighbor there'd
[7:52] be some manifestation there'd be some
[7:54] expression of this that you love your
[7:56] neighbor but it's you love your neighbor
[7:59] with the love you have for yourself you
[8:01] following me in that I I feel like this
[8:03] is something I just want to kind of I
[8:04] want to break down says we say love thy
[8:06] neighbor as thyself you recognize then
[8:09] you have to have a love for yourself
[8:11] that has if you can say well then how do
[8:13] I love how do I love my neighbor well
[8:14] how do you love yourself
[8:16] and the Bible believe in it kind of
[8:17] hints at the way that the flesh
[8:19] instinctively act says no man no man has
[8:21] ever hated his own flesh. So in some
[8:23] ways there's some idea about myself and
[8:26] what I would prefer and what I would
[8:27] want. I'm reminded of a story one time
[8:29] where a mother uh had made a cake and
[8:32] asked the kids to come in and get a
[8:34] piece of cake and and they ran in and
[8:36] the one that got there first grabbed the
[8:38] biggest piece. And so the younger one
[8:40] getting there second got the smaller
[8:41] piece and the the one sitting there
[8:43] holding the smaller piece said, "Well,
[8:45] if I had gotten here first, I would have
[8:47] given you the bigger piece." And he
[8:48] said, "Well, you ended up with the one
[8:50] you were going to have. What are you
[8:51] what are you what are you complaining
[8:52] about?" Right? Because there's, you
[8:54] know, there that's kind of the way we
[8:56] think sometimes is I want the big piece
[8:58] and well, if it was me, I would have
[8:59] given you the big piece. Well, you got
[9:00] what you would have gotten to begin
[9:01] with. What are we complaining for?
[9:03] That's why you have one person cut and
[9:04] the other person choose. And that's how
[9:07] that's how you keep people honest. I did
[9:08] one time, this is a good story. I don't
[9:11] know if we need to stop the tape, but
[9:13] this is a good story. I got to share it.
[9:14] We went to a dinner uh it was for my
[9:17] brother was getting married and we went
[9:18] to a dinner, really, really nice
[9:20] steakhouse. And at the end of the
[9:21] dinner, we were going to split dessert.
[9:23] And I was sitting next to a brother,
[9:25] wonderful brother. He will go, he who
[9:27] will not be mentioned by name.
[9:30] And he is not my blood brother either,
[9:32] but we were going to split a carrot
[9:34] cake. I love carrot cake. And what's
[9:36] what's one of the best parts of the
[9:37] carrot cake besides the carrot, right?
[9:40] Icing. So I I said, "You go ahead and
[9:43] split it, Brother Kyle."
[9:45] and he took the carrot cake and cut it
[9:49] in half,
[9:51] took the top part with all the icing and
[9:54] handed me the rest. And I was like,
[9:56] "What in the world? How do you split
[9:58] cake?" I was like, "That was one of the
[10:00] that was the that was when the only
[10:02] child really really he had never split a
[10:05] cake before, ever in his whole life. He
[10:06] didn't know how to split a cake." And so
[10:09] there's a if that's what you would do to
[10:10] your we're thinking I don't know how we
[10:12] got on carrot cake but I'm starting to
[10:13] get a hankering for good carrot cake.
[10:16] But there's there's this thought process
[10:18] if I'm to love my neighbor as I love
[10:20] myself. The first maybe you back up and
[10:22] say well then how do I what do I think
[10:23] of myself? How do I love myself? Because
[10:26] I may be treating others. I'm kind of
[10:28] getting way ahead of myself in this. I
[10:30] may be treating others kind of through
[10:32] this instinct of how I treat myself. And
[10:35] that's never going to be right until you
[10:37] first find disharmony with your heart,
[10:38] soul, and mind in your in love with God.
[10:41] There's if there's some discontinuity
[10:42] with your peace at with God and in some
[10:44] unrest and some fear in that
[10:46] relationship, it's going to tend to
[10:48] project in uh towards yourself and
[10:50] towards others. So, kind of just if you
[10:52] feel like you can check out at this
[10:54] point, um there's some real gold in
[10:55] that. If you could jot it down fast
[10:56] enough, you can go to um a place that
[10:59] serves carrot cake before it closes
[11:00] because I'm just going to amplify that
[11:03] uh as we continue. So this love for
[11:04] yourself, this love for your neighbor is
[11:06] an expression of the love of God. Jesus
[11:08] says in John 13:es 34-35, a new
[11:12] commandment I give unto you, that's a
[11:13] very bold statement in light of the fact
[11:15] that what is the great commandment and
[11:17] we we we believe in the law and all the
[11:19] law and the prophets. And he said, I'm
[11:20] going to give you a new commandment that
[11:22] you love one another as I have loved you
[11:25] that you also love one another. So it's
[11:27] this love in harmony and continuity with
[11:29] the love of Christ. By this shall all
[11:31] men know that you are my disciples if
[11:33] you have love one to another. So love
[11:36] for God is made manifest in our love
[11:38] towards one another. That this is how
[11:40] men are going to know that you are my
[11:41] disciples. That you that you love you
[11:44] love your brother. A man that loves God
[11:46] loves his brother also. You cannot hate
[11:48] your brother, mistreat your neighbor and
[11:49] then claim that you're doing it in the
[11:51] love of God and in the name of God. So
[11:53] if you love one another, this is an
[11:55] expression of family, the family of God
[11:58] and the blood of Jesus Christ. And to
[12:02] say that thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[12:04] thyself together with love the Lord thy
[12:05] God with all thy heart, soul, and mind.
[12:08] This there's this rem wonderful
[12:10] remarkable interaction between the love
[12:13] of yourself and the love of your
[12:14] neighbor. And I want to look at if we
[12:17] could look at where we begin with
[12:18] Matthew 7:es 1:2 to start looking how
[12:22] these things relate to one another. He
[12:24] says, "Judge not that you be not judged.
[12:26] For with what judgment ye judge, ye
[12:28] shall be judged, and with what measure
[12:30] ye meet, it shall be measured to you."
[12:32] Again,
[12:34] there is so much um to be expressed in
[12:39] this on this judge not that you be not
[12:43] judged. But it's saying with the measure
[12:45] that you measure by, you'll be measured
[12:47] by it also. And and it's part of your
[12:49] testimony. Uh kind of the way that you
[12:52] measure things a and your opinion of
[12:54] things and your measure of things,
[12:55] you're also going to be measured by it
[12:57] as well. And there's there's ways that
[12:58] you can begin to ponder this and think
[13:00] about how that if you have a particular
[13:02] testimony and you always do things a
[13:04] certain way or you do things very
[13:05] harshly, then people are going to react
[13:07] and respond to you in terms of the
[13:09] measure, the way that you are measured,
[13:11] the way that you are expressed. And it
[13:13] fits very beautifully within the context
[13:15] of barriers and boundaries because a
[13:17] boundary is a measure of something. It's
[13:18] the extent of something. It's the limits
[13:20] of something. So judge not that you be
[13:22] not judged because with whatever measure
[13:24] or judgment that you judge with or
[13:27] measure with, you're also going to be
[13:28] measured as well. So it's talking about
[13:30] some sort of limits of something, the
[13:32] reach of something and even the extent
[13:35] to which you do something. So it's
[13:37] expressive of how how you respect
[13:40] things, how you judge things, how you
[13:42] relate to things and it stands for the
[13:45] principle that if you are and I I'll use
[13:47] it in this context if you're severe and
[13:49] harsh with other people then it'll
[13:51] instigate the same to you. Bible teaches
[13:54] us that a soft answer turneth away
[13:56] wrath. Why? Because it's in the softness
[13:59] and the appropriateness and the
[14:00] reasonleness of that answer. It's not
[14:02] provoking and instigating something to
[14:05] respond in kind. It's why Jesus says
[14:07] that if you they smite you on the cheek,
[14:09] that kind of condescending h uh action
[14:12] towards you, if you fight back, uh uh
[14:15] then you're escalating things. When when
[14:17] you confront something, you're
[14:18] escalating it. But here, uh so that's
[14:21] kind of what the idea is. If whatever
[14:22] you're measuring out, you're probably
[14:24] instigating the same to you. Well,
[14:25] you're always hard on everybody else and
[14:27] you're always doing this and you're
[14:28] always doing that. then other people are
[14:29] going to measure you by the same thing.
[14:32] Says it this way in Luke chapter 6 two
[14:34] verses in verses 37 and 38. Judge not
[14:38] and you shall not be judged. So I think
[14:41] sometimes there's a very like the
[14:43] cliffnotes of it is don't judge. Don't
[14:45] judge. Don't judge. But you take the
[14:46] whole word of God and we are required to
[14:49] judge. So there's a judging not that you
[14:51] do and there's a judging that you must
[14:52] also do. But then in this light he's
[14:54] saying if you don't judge you won't be
[14:56] judged. And so then it speaks to this
[14:59] principle that it's not that we don't
[15:01] ever want to judge, but if you're going
[15:02] to judge, you better be judging with the
[15:04] right thing,
[15:05] the right standard. Judge not, you shall
[15:06] not be judged. Condemn not, and you
[15:08] shall not be condemned. Forgive and you
[15:09] shall be forgiven. Give and it shall be
[15:12] given unto you. Good measure, pressed
[15:14] down and shaken together and running
[15:16] over. It's a beautiful poetry that
[15:19] Christ uses here in terms of something
[15:21] being measured, but it's actually being
[15:23] compacted down, pressed down so that
[15:24] whatever vessel would be measuring,
[15:26] you're getting the fullest of it. You're
[15:27] you're you're not being defraed. You're
[15:29] not nothing's being withheld from you
[15:31] and shaken. And even running over,
[15:33] something was to be filled up to the
[15:34] point where it's running over. You're
[15:36] not being cheated on what you're getting
[15:38] in return. Nothing's being held back
[15:41] from you. No blessing is being
[15:42] restrained. some sort of affection or or
[15:45] giving, offering in some way to do
[15:48] something for someone else. He says,
[15:49] "Give and it shall be given to you good
[15:51] measure, pressed down, shaken together,
[15:53] running over a lot of different images
[15:54] that are coming up in terms of
[15:56] measurements and and and fluids and
[15:58] spices and things." He says, "And shall
[16:00] and these things," he says, "shall men
[16:01] give into your bosom. For with the same
[16:04] measure that you meet with all, it shall
[16:06] be measured to you again." If you
[16:09] exhibit a grace and patience to others,
[16:11] in time they will likewise exhibit a
[16:13] grace and patience towards you. If you
[16:16] have ever been very short or very curt
[16:18] or impatient with somebody else,
[16:19] ultimately they will likewise begin to
[16:22] measure you the same way or measure the
[16:24] relationship the same way because at the
[16:26] very least you're establishing the
[16:28] parameters of how we react to one
[16:30] another and relate to one another within
[16:32] the context of this relationship. Oh,
[16:34] this is how we do things. When we want
[16:36] to get something done, we raise our
[16:37] voice. when we want to get something to
[16:38] done, we just do it ourselves and
[16:39] apologize for it later. You're kind of
[16:41] establishing the standard operating
[16:43] procedures by the way that you act. And
[16:45] Jesus saying that whatever measure you
[16:46] meet out, it'll be measured to you
[16:48] again. So, we we begin to become very
[16:50] circumspect with the way that we act,
[16:53] way that we think.
[16:55] Jesus says it this way in verse 12 of
[16:57] Matthew chapter 7. I was going to read
[16:58] all the way to this point uh but in in
[17:01] our text but I felt just jumping to it
[17:03] would be wonderful even though it is
[17:05] dealing with asking and receiving which
[17:08] fits very well with these uh things that
[17:11] we're reading. It says therefore all
[17:13] things whatsoever you would that men
[17:15] should do to you do ye even so to them
[17:18] for this is the law and the prophets.
[17:22] In Matthew chapter 22, the whole law
[17:25] hangeth and the prophets hangeth on
[17:28] these two commandments. Thou shalt love
[17:29] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[17:31] with all thy soul and with all thy mind.
[17:33] And thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[17:35] thyself. Jesus puts it this way in these
[17:38] in the sermon on the mount that to do
[17:41] whatever you would want someone to do to
[17:43] you, you do to them also. And somehow
[17:47] this is summarizing
[17:49] and in and capturing the law and the
[17:52] prophets in the same way that we would
[17:54] love the Lord thy God with all our
[17:55] heart, soul, and mind and that we would
[17:57] love our neighbors as ourselves. It's
[17:58] somehow embodied in in summed up in this
[18:01] principle that do to others as you would
[18:05] have them do unto you.
[18:07] Are you thinking about this?
[18:14] Would you agree that that's a good
[18:16] principle to live by? Is this is what
[18:18] they call the golden rule. Am I right
[18:19] about that? Golden rule. Do unto others
[18:21] as they would have them do unto you. It
[18:22] exists in a lot of different other
[18:24] theologies and religions and uh and
[18:26] belief systems. And and for us, those of
[18:28] us in Christianity, we would derive
[18:30] maybe the golden rule from this. Do ye
[18:32] even so to them. For this is the law and
[18:35] the prophets. Whatever someone you would
[18:37] want someone to do to you, you do to
[18:39] someone else. I know there's some
[18:41] different takes on this in that there's
[18:43] a platinum rule. They kind of take the
[18:44] golden rule and what has to be more
[18:46] valuable than that. They come up with
[18:47] the platinum rule and um some of them I
[18:51] think some of the teachings on it is
[18:52] that the platinum rule is do to somebody
[18:55] else treat someone how they would want
[18:57] to be treated. And then I think maybe
[18:59] another take on it is treat others. The
[19:01] platinum rule would be treat others as
[19:02] Christ would treat them. And those those
[19:05] are those are some nice principles that
[19:08] would certainly be applicable. But the
[19:10] Bible, Christ, whether you want to call
[19:12] this a golden rule or not, he's saying
[19:14] this is the law and the prophets. Treat
[19:17] others how you want to be treated.
[19:19] That's that that's that's significant.
[19:21] That's very substantial. And I know
[19:22] maybe in our minds we're thinking, well,
[19:23] brother Aaron, where's that how does
[19:25] that fit into the third pull? I well
[19:28] it's it's uh it's the word of God
[19:32] that's instructing the soul for a
[19:35] purpose and this the word of God em
[19:38] embodies redemption and there there
[19:40] shouldn't be anything in this word of
[19:41] God that we would be very that we'd be
[19:43] quick to dismiss and just say well
[19:45] that's for the Baptist or that's for the
[19:46] Methodist and let the others have that
[19:48] let the Pentecostals have this. We want
[19:50] it all. Right? We want it all. We want
[19:53] all the word of God. So, if there's a if
[19:55] there's a particular itch that you want
[19:56] scratched in terms of the deep things,
[19:58] let me tell you, there's depth in this.
[20:00] There's tremendous depth in looking at
[20:02] this that we do unto others as you'd
[20:03] have them do unto you. And we will treat
[20:06] others,
[20:08] if I could put it this way, and this
[20:09] might be the little bit of the catch
[20:10] that I want you to consider, because in
[20:13] the in the evolution of humanity and in
[20:17] the the nature and nurture of our lives,
[20:20] we don't think perfectly. We don't react
[20:22] perfectly. We don't process things the
[20:24] right way. We see things and perceive
[20:25] them inaccurately. We judge others and
[20:28] we're very quick just to kind of relate
[20:30] to our environment through our
[20:31] experiences. And so it's not always, it
[20:35] wouldn't always be a perfect principle
[20:37] to do to somebody else what you would do
[20:40] to yourself.
[20:42] And that's maybe where people try to
[20:44] come up with these other levels of these
[20:45] rules because they recognize the flaw in
[20:47] the carnal application of it. And so if
[20:50] I can say this way, we will treat others
[20:51] in the manner that we believe we ought
[20:53] to be treated.
[20:56] Does that can you make an application of
[20:57] that? I'm not trying to say change
[20:58] what's been said, but often we will
[21:02] treat others, whether it be with
[21:05] kindness or contempt or however we might
[21:07] treat others. We're we're often treating
[21:09] others in a situation the way that we
[21:12] think we should be treated if we did the
[21:14] same thing. And it's not necessarily
[21:16] always the right way because we think
[21:18] that we deserve something. We deserve a
[21:20] harshness. We deserve a a a
[21:22] mistreatment. And there's those that
[21:24] come to relate to correction and love
[21:27] and relationships, the particular
[21:29] paradigm like love is hard and love is
[21:31] harsh and and this is how we do things
[21:33] culturally or this is this is how my dad
[21:36] talked to my mom or this is how I
[21:37] learned I learned tough love and fear is
[21:39] a great motivator and this is just the
[21:41] way that someone's learned it. So when
[21:43] something happens, they respond saying,
[21:45] "Oh, this is the way that this is the
[21:47] way love is expressed or this is the way
[21:49] that we handle things. This is way we
[21:50] deal with things in the message." and
[21:52] and you do it because in your mind
[21:53] you're thinking if that was me this is
[21:55] what I would deserve.
[21:57] And in Matthew chapter 18 and this is
[22:00] where I would have loved to have spent
[22:02] uh more time reading through this
[22:04] because in Matthew chapter 18 it's
[22:06] giving us these tremendous principles on
[22:09] how to deal with somebody when they've
[22:11] offended you when your brother
[22:13] trespasses against you. And it says, you
[22:16] know, the question comes up, well, how
[22:18] many times should we forgive our brother
[22:20] when he trespasses us? And he says,
[22:22] until seven times, but until 70* 7.
[22:26] And I'd like to come back to this, and
[22:28] if I don't, at least I will have been
[22:30] able to say it. Now, some of us have
[22:32] taken that to mean that we've got a
[22:34] demolition permit every day against any
[22:37] brother that at least 70* 7 I can do
[22:39] whatever I want. or that we feel like,
[22:42] well, if I've got to def if I've got to
[22:44] forgive my brother 70 times seven, then
[22:47] I've got to give him an opportunity to
[22:49] offend and trespass 70* 7. But there's
[22:52] no way you can correctly read that to
[22:54] mean that you ought to offer yourself to
[22:56] be defrauded and trespassed against 70*
[22:58] 7. It's just if he does, forgive them.
[23:02] And if anybody starts getting very
[23:03] anxious, forgiveness has never
[23:05] necessitated reconciliation
[23:09] or the restoration of the same kind of
[23:11] conduct. Right? To forgive somebody, if
[23:14] somebody's done something to deeply hurt
[23:16] you, forgiveness does not require that
[23:18] you take a hold of their hand again and
[23:20] give them another opportunity to hurt
[23:21] you. You can forgive and you can go
[23:25] forward. And there need not be
[23:27] reconciliation as evidence of your
[23:29] forgiveness.
[23:30] The evidence of your forgiveness is to
[23:32] let go any bitterness and and the and
[23:34] justice and Lord bring this down upon
[23:36] them and let them pay the price.
[23:37] Forgiveness is expressed. You say,
[23:39] "Lord, forgive them. I'm free. My
[23:41] offender no longer has power over me. I
[23:44] go forward in forgiveness." And there's
[23:45] no the word is not saying, "Well, if you
[23:48] really forgave them, you'd be able to go
[23:49] right back there in the right place you
[23:51] were before and put yourself in the
[23:53] position for it to happen again." That's
[23:55] not the wisdom of forgiveness.
[23:58] So just um that probably merits much
[24:01] more than that. But I just I say that
[24:03] because I know sometimes there's an
[24:04] anxiety that comes with in the talk
[24:06] speaking about forgiveness. We think oh
[24:08] if I forgive them then I have to just I
[24:10] got to put myself right back in the same
[24:11] place again. And that's not true.
[24:14] So in the uh but in
[24:18] I think it's a wonderful preface to the
[24:20] parable of the unforgiving servant
[24:22] because in the in Matthew chapter 18
[24:25] Jesus is saying that the kingdom of
[24:26] heaven is likened under a certain king
[24:28] and he he's kind of going through his
[24:29] accounting and he finds somebody that
[24:30] owes him some money owed him 10,000
[24:33] talents and he goes to him and the the
[24:36] man kind of pleads before him and
[24:37] humbles himself and he says please have
[24:39] patience with me. I I will pay you
[24:41] everything. And it and it kind of moved
[24:43] the king. He thought, "Oh my, what
[24:44] humility
[24:46] he offered to pay me. He humbled himself
[24:48] before me." And the Bible says that he
[24:49] had compassion and loosed him and
[24:51] forgave him all his debt. And do you
[24:53] remember the rest of the story? This one
[24:56] who had just was owed owed owed the king
[24:58] 10,000 talents humbled himself. Oh,
[25:01] forgive me. I'll pay you everything
[25:02] back. And the king move with compassion
[25:04] forgives him all of his debts. He leaves
[25:06] and he goes and he finds a servant that
[25:08] owes him a hundred p.
[25:11] and and he and he lays his hands on him.
[25:13] It says it took him by the throat and
[25:16] said, "Pay me what thou."
[25:18] The fellow servant fell down at his feet
[25:20] beside him said, "Have patience with me
[25:21] and I I'll pay thee all." And he would
[25:23] not. Now, the the the individual does
[25:25] exactly what the one who owed the most
[25:27] did before and he falls down. He says,
[25:28] "Oh, pay me. I I please have patience
[25:30] with me." But the one who had been
[25:32] forgiven, it says he would not. And he
[25:33] cast him into prison till he should pay
[25:35] the debt. Now, skip to verse 32. Then
[25:38] his lord, after that, he had called him.
[25:40] He saw what had happened. When he'd
[25:41] heard what had happened, he said, "Oh,
[25:43] thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all
[25:46] that debt because thou desireest me. You
[25:48] humbled yourself. You said, "Please be
[25:50] patient with me. A, and I had
[25:52] compassion." He says, "Shouldn't you
[25:54] have had compassion on thy fellow
[25:56] servant even as I had pity on thee?"
[25:59] I'm not trying to psychoanalyze what was
[26:01] going on in this servant's heart who had
[26:03] been forgiven and who could have should
[26:05] have walked out and then seen somebody
[26:07] else who owed him money and said, "You
[26:09] know what? I just got forgiven a
[26:11] thousand talons. I'm going to forgive
[26:12] you a hundred pence because I'm I've
[26:15] just been loved and I've been forgiven
[26:17] much and and I've been loved much and
[26:19] therefore I want to express the same.
[26:21] But something didn't connect in what
[26:24] this individual this mercy he received
[26:26] from the king so that when he went out
[26:28] to deal with someone that owed him
[26:29] money, he treated the one that owed him
[26:32] money the way that he thought he ought
[26:33] to have been treated by the king.
[26:37] And you say, "Well, how do you know
[26:38] that?" Okay, perhaps perhaps he did to
[26:41] the one who owed him a hundred what he
[26:42] thought he deserved from the king and he
[26:46] so he's behaving and he's acting out
[26:47] towards somebody who owes him money the
[26:49] way that he felt he he ought to have
[26:51] been treated whenever the king dealt
[26:54] with him with p grace and with patience.
[26:56] And think about it for ourselves. Has
[26:58] God ever been impatient with you?
[27:01] Be careful now.
[27:03] Has he ever been late? He's always
[27:05] demonstrated there should have been a
[27:07] lot more amens. Help me out, brother
[27:08] Loy. If they're not going to amen, you
[27:09] have to make up, brother. You guys are
[27:10] going to make up for the rest of it. But
[27:12] if there's if God has been so patient
[27:14] with us, so gracious to us, so merciful
[27:16] to us, they're renewed every morning,
[27:18] says his grace is this stubborn,
[27:20] relentless force,
[27:23] that when we've tried to push it away
[27:24] and say we don't want it and acted all
[27:26] sorts of and tried to outrun it, his
[27:28] grace always outruns us and catches us
[27:30] by surprise. You can't get away from me.
[27:32] Right? And that's how his grace and his
[27:35] patience and his mercy is. It never runs
[27:37] out for us. We've always been the
[27:39] beneficiaries of it. But why is it it's
[27:41] so hard for us to sometimes do the same
[27:45] thing for others
[27:46] to have grace and have patience. Not to
[27:48] the extent that it would be this
[27:49] unending
[27:51] grace that God has, but sometimes we
[27:53] can't show any of it
[27:56] when we've been forgiven much and we
[27:58] can't forgive. When we've been loved
[28:00] much and we can't love. When we find
[28:01] ourselves being a recipient of so much
[28:03] goodness from God, but yet it's not
[28:05] internalized and expressed back out, is
[28:07] there some disconnect in how we're
[28:09] relating to the love we've received from
[28:11] God? Is there some part of our thought
[28:13] process that says, "Yeah, well, I'm
[28:15] going to get it eventually, or this is
[28:17] going to run out, or there's something
[28:18] fraudulent about it." Are we not fully
[28:20] accepting and receiving the love of God
[28:22] for ourselves and feeling that even
[28:24] though I will never be worthy, he deemed
[28:27] me valuable enough to save? He deemed me
[28:30] valuable enough to pay a price. And that
[28:32] I I I I have some sense of worth in his
[28:35] eyes. I have a sense of value in his
[28:37] eyes. That everything that God has been
[28:39] doing from the moment that he formed
[28:40] himself, I find myself today with all
[28:42] the momentum of all the love that is of
[28:45] God that's ever been expressed and it's
[28:46] being projected towards me.
[28:50] This is his love for me. This is
[28:51] something very real for me. And if
[28:53] there's some disconnect in that, that's
[28:55] what would make it easy for someone to
[28:57] come out from the presence of the king
[28:59] and then find yourself in the position
[29:01] of the king now with the opportunity to
[29:04] forgive and show grace and show
[29:05] compassion as this king put it. I
[29:08] forgave your debt. Shouldn't you have
[29:09] also had compassion and had pity as I
[29:12] had pity? It's because we don't relate
[29:14] to the mercy we've received the right
[29:16] way. So, we treat others the way that we
[29:19] think we ought to be treated.
[29:23] If that's a a unique thought for you to
[29:25] kind of chew on, it's just something the
[29:28] Lord's been doing with my heart and
[29:29] perhaps you could just let the Lord work
[29:31] it into your heart the way that he would
[29:33] want to. in Philippians chapter 1:9
[29:38] because this is part of judging.
[29:41] Whatever measure you meet out, you'll be
[29:43] measured with
[29:45] whatever
[29:47] whatever however you measure other
[29:49] people by, we should be honest with
[29:50] ourselves and measure ourselves as well.
[29:52] You say, "I can't believe they did that.
[29:54] That's that's just awful." And I mean,
[29:56] there should be some if somebody stands
[29:57] say, "Well, you did the same thing. Why
[30:00] is it awful that they did it?" And we
[30:01] should be like, "Oh, you know what?
[30:02] You're right. I'm wrong. you know, I
[30:04] need to apologize. At some point, I need
[30:05] to apologize either for judging that or
[30:06] for what I've done before. And so,
[30:09] there's a way that also we're measuring
[30:10] ourselves by these things. And and
[30:12] there's a certain idea that we have of
[30:14] ourselves. In Philippians 1:9, now I
[30:17] might be kind of moving to something
[30:18] else that's orbiting in this. And I do
[30:20] see them as related to one another, but
[30:22] I've got to kind of move down in this
[30:24] path a little bit further. He says, "And
[30:25] this I pray that your love may abound
[30:28] yet more and more." So love can abound.
[30:30] It can grow. we can increase in
[30:32] knowledge and in all judgment.
[30:36] We quite often reference how let your
[30:38] love be without dissimulation. Let it be
[30:40] without hypocrisy. Ahore that which is
[30:42] evil, cleave to that which is good. If
[30:44] you if you say that you love the God and
[30:46] and love the things of the world, the
[30:48] love of God is not in you. So there's
[30:50] something there's something distinct
[30:52] about the love of God that cannot spill
[30:54] over into wickedness. There's a the love
[30:56] of God will go to a point where it
[30:58] stops. And you can't say that you love
[31:00] God and still love the things of the
[31:02] world. You can't say that you love God
[31:04] and hate your brother. Right? So there's
[31:06] there's a limit to it. There's there's a
[31:08] there's an indicator. Say, "Oh,
[31:09] something's been flipped around.
[31:10] Something's missing." That's that's not
[31:12] what the love of God does. And so he's
[31:13] saying, "I pray that your love would
[31:15] abound more and more, grow to be more
[31:17] complete, more full in knowledge and in
[31:20] all judgments." Discernment. And so if I
[31:23] could say this, love is is decisive. And
[31:26] love is about decisions. Love is about
[31:29] judgments. Love is about understanding.
[31:31] He said, I would that your love would
[31:33] abound more and more in more floral
[31:35] arrangements and boxes of chocolates a a
[31:38] and forgiveness and mercy and grace. But
[31:40] it's not in those terms. He says it's in
[31:43] knowledge and in judgment. Because in
[31:46] order to meet out mercy, you have to
[31:49] have the correct kind of discernment. In
[31:52] order to really meet out grace and
[31:54] patience, in order for some of these
[31:55] other characteristics, if I can say it
[31:57] this way, well, if there's going to be a
[31:59] proper expression of it, it has to be an
[32:02] accurate measure. It has to be it has to
[32:04] be in truth and in reality. This can't
[32:07] be guesswork where you're just a a blind
[32:09] squirrel finding a nut every once in a
[32:11] while. It has to be I know what I'm
[32:13] doing. This is very precise. This is
[32:15] this is responsive. I'm reacting to this
[32:18] in a particular way. And so love is
[32:21] about judgment, discernment, knowledge,
[32:23] decisions. And love, true love
[32:28] is manifested in in deliberate
[32:31] informed conduct informed. It's it's
[32:35] knowledgeable. We talked before about uh
[32:38] the difference between felo love and
[32:40] agape love. Felio love doesn't have any
[32:42] higher purpose attached to it. It's just
[32:44] I want this. I love this. I have a
[32:46] feeling for this. I want to satisfy this
[32:48] affection. I want to satisfy this
[32:49] emotion. There's no higher purpose
[32:51] associated with it. There's no higher
[32:52] intelligence. That's agape has a higher
[32:55] intelligence. Has a has a higher motive
[32:57] and objective. His ways are higher than
[32:59] our ways. And so this kind of love that
[33:01] Paul was praying to the Philippians that
[33:03] would become would abound more and more
[33:05] and more comprehensive discernment and
[33:07] more knowledge. It is something that's
[33:08] manifested in a a purposeful conduct,
[33:11] deliberate conduct, something that's
[33:13] attached to a higher intelligence. And
[33:16] again, this is where love is so easily
[33:18] misunderstood. It's not warm feelings.
[33:20] It's not the fuzziness. It's not the
[33:22] tingly, but it's re it's manifested in
[33:25] proper judgment.
[33:28] There's a way that and I want to
[33:29] reference this because I I I just don't
[33:30] know where I would find the place to be
[33:32] able to amplify this in in the context
[33:35] of this, but we say love covers and love
[33:37] hides a hides a multitude of sins.
[33:41] It it doesn't mean that love buries its
[33:43] head in the sand so that it can see no
[33:45] evil, hear no evil, and never know.
[33:48] When love hides a multitude of sins, it
[33:50] must first say that's wrong.
[33:54] To hide it doesn't mean to justify it.
[33:57] doesn't mean to. It means it's not going
[33:59] to bring dishonor. It's not going to try
[34:01] to shame inappropriate. It's it's going
[34:04] to love is going to respond the right
[34:06] way to wrong. It's not going to say it's
[34:08] not wrong.
[34:10] Sometimes we think that's what love is.
[34:11] Love is just compromise, compromise,
[34:13] compromise, compromise. No, that's not
[34:15] what love is. Love is something that is
[34:17] about judgment.
[34:20] And coming back to love thy neighbor as
[34:23] thyself.
[34:26] What does it mean to love your your
[34:28] neighbor as yourself? To love yourself
[34:31] is to see yourself as you truly are.
[34:34] You I if to love your neighbor as
[34:37] yourself,
[34:39] you cannot to love your neighbor is a
[34:41] reflection of the love you have for
[34:43] yourself. So I feel I'm wanting to put
[34:44] it this way. First, we receive the love
[34:46] of God and we love God with all our
[34:48] mind, soul, and and body, our mind,
[34:50] soul, and spirit. We have this love of
[34:52] God and now I'm to love my neighbor, but
[34:56] the measure is how I love myself.
[35:00] So then I'm look I'm looking at how that
[35:02] I love God and now how how I view myself
[35:05] and how I love myself. And to love
[35:07] yourself is remember the pride paradox.
[35:11] To love yourself is to have the proper
[35:13] view of yourself. Not one that's
[35:16] inflated, but also one that's not
[35:17] deflated, one that's not out of out of
[35:20] bounds, either too much or not enough,
[35:22] is to really see yourself as you are in
[35:24] what your need is, but also in your the
[35:27] value that you have. If if if we just
[35:30] kind of buy this this aspect that we're
[35:32] worthless, we're sinful, we're garbage,
[35:34] we're trash, and we're filthy, and and
[35:37] we just buy into that paradigm, then
[35:40] we're we're never going to be able to
[35:42] transition into you are worthy, you're a
[35:44] daughter of God, you're forgiven, you're
[35:47] justified, you you the price was been
[35:49] has been paid for you, you are you are
[35:52] um unique, precious jewels. I mean, all
[35:54] the different things that the scripture
[35:56] has to say about us that there's a way
[35:57] that we have to realize this is where I
[35:59] was in my need. This is what the word of
[36:01] God has done for me. And by supernatural
[36:04] transformation, I have now been birthed
[36:05] into the kingdom of God. Not as an
[36:07] orphan, not as a beggar, not as somebody
[36:10] who at any moment can be kicked out, but
[36:12] as joint hes with Jesus Christ. So you
[36:14] to tr to love yourself at some point is
[36:17] to see yourself for what you need, but
[36:19] then to also see the value in yourself.
[36:23] To love yourself is to see yourself for
[36:25] who you are.
[36:27] And to love your neighbor is to see him
[36:28] in his need. Also,
[36:31] to not heap upon him what you think
[36:33] would be right, not to give him what you
[36:35] think would be uh gracious and kind, and
[36:37] to not pour upon him or bestow upon him
[36:40] the things that you think would make him
[36:41] feel warm and fuzzy and endear him to
[36:43] you, but to love your neighbor is to see
[36:45] his need, but then to also recognize his
[36:47] value.
[36:49] I think the if I could say this is just
[36:51] personally that it's so we take the the
[36:55] the doctrine of election and because we
[36:58] know that there's souls that are elect
[37:00] and there's souls that are not we just
[37:02] start doing the calculations every day
[37:03] and we say well that soul may not be
[37:04] worth it and that soul may not be worth
[37:06] it that soul's worth it
[37:09] right instead of thinking there's value
[37:12] in every soul
[37:14] there's a value in that person
[37:17] I I don't want to read it for time sake.
[37:18] But in Matthew, as we're reading in our
[37:20] text, it says, "Why don't you remove the
[37:23] the beam from your eye before you remove
[37:25] the one from your brother, the moat, the
[37:30] splinter from your brother's eye. You're
[37:32] you're you're wanting to do something
[37:34] for your brother a and to remedy
[37:36] something and do something for him. I I
[37:38] want to get that sliver out." But he
[37:39] says, "Why don't you slow down?" Because
[37:40] he said, "You're being a little bit
[37:42] hypocritical. Maybe you need to address
[37:43] something in your own vision before you
[37:46] move very quickly to remove a splinter
[37:48] for someone else's eye. Remove first the
[37:50] beam from your eye. Then he says you'll
[37:52] be able to see clearly.
[37:55] And as we touched on that before, and I
[37:56] think it was in the pride paradoxes, we
[37:58] touched on that before. It was something
[37:59] where you're not castigated for having
[38:01] the wrong discernment. He says, "But
[38:02] once you've addressed that, you'll be
[38:04] able to see clearly to remove the
[38:05] splinter from your brother's eyes." So
[38:07] there is some sort of you're you're
[38:08] thinking the right way. You're wanting
[38:10] to do the right thing, but you have to
[38:11] have things in it be done in order.
[38:17] There's a in loving your neighbor,
[38:24] we c we can't render to him
[38:27] things that that we feel relate to
[38:30] kindness and and joy and happiness and
[38:33] good things
[38:35] and not be giving him what he's due and
[38:38] still be loving him. Like in other
[38:39] words, we you love has to render what is
[38:41] due.
[38:44] In Proverbs chapter 19 verse8,
[38:47] to love yourself is to see yourself as
[38:48] you truly are. To love yourself is what
[38:50] we're looking at. To love your neighbor
[38:51] as yourself, you have to love yourself
[38:53] and love yourself correctly. Proverbs
[38:55] chapter 19:8, he that getth wisdom
[38:57] loveth his own soul. He that keepeth
[39:00] understanding shall find good. This is a
[39:02] beautiful scripture.
[39:04] One translation I think renders it, a
[39:06] wise man loves himself.
[39:10] And you obviously that might be kind of
[39:12] uh condensing down what is being said,
[39:15] but he that pursues wisdom and gets
[39:17] wisdom loves his own soul.
[39:21] And then there's a and that's kind of
[39:23] the reciprocal response that the more
[39:25] wisdom I have, the more I'm going to
[39:27] love my soul, the more value I'm going
[39:29] to see in myself. It's a it's it's a
[39:31] beautiful uh it's a beautiful picture
[39:34] that in getting wisdom it's beneficial
[39:37] to the soul. It's valuable to the soul.
[39:39] He that gets wisdom loves his own soul
[39:41] and he that keepeth understanding shall
[39:43] find good. This is lifting up somebody
[39:46] who recognizes that there's value in
[39:48] wisdom and the and in wisdom there's a
[39:50] love for the soul. It's being projected
[39:52] to the soul. There's a value and a worth
[39:54] in the person. And we must act. I I I
[39:58] want to get this out out to you tonight.
[40:01] We must act in a manner that it
[40:04] harmonizes with we must act in a way
[40:06] that comports with the love for our
[40:08] souls. Our actions have to demonstrate
[40:11] that there's a care and a concern for
[40:13] our soul.
[40:15] That this is a way to moderate all
[40:17] behavior. This is a way to process
[40:18] decisions. This is a way to think about
[40:20] our children's character. This is a way
[40:22] to think about not only how we're
[40:23] treating others, but what we're
[40:24] subjecting ourselves to. I must act in a
[40:26] manner that demonstrates that I do love
[40:29] my soul. And therefore, by extension, by
[40:31] having a love for my soul, I act in a
[40:34] manner that that shows that I am
[40:37] conscious and aware of the preciousness
[40:39] of my spirit and my body.
[40:42] We've tried to emphasize this uh to this
[40:44] point in several of these services that
[40:46] this body is a temple of the Holy Ghost.
[40:49] The spirit I is is something that is
[40:52] that we are to protect and we'll come to
[40:53] it in a moment. something that is
[40:55] important to God. And so the word of God
[40:58] is teaching us to not only see that our
[41:00] soul will be sealed, but a love for our
[41:03] soul causes us to act in a way that
[41:05] demonstrates that our soul is valuable
[41:07] and that we love our souls, but then by
[41:09] extension also the sanctity and the
[41:12] cleanness of our spirits and the
[41:14] preservation of our bodies.
[41:18] So we must we ought to act towards
[41:20] others then in a manner that
[41:23] demonstrates we value the soul
[41:27] that there's a there's there's a soul
[41:29] there's a soul at issue with everyone
[41:32] and we act in a way that speaks that
[41:35] there is a concern in a love for someone
[41:37] else's soul.
[41:40] It's in that way sometimes that the love
[41:42] of the truth gets missed to where we're
[41:44] just trying to prove to people we're
[41:45] right
[41:47] instead of really caring about their
[41:48] soul.
[41:50] We're we're too often trying to defend
[41:54] our our correctness
[41:56] as opposed to thinking of they're wrong
[41:59] and the ramifications to the soul are
[42:01] tremendous.
[42:03] So I'm not going to approach this from
[42:04] the standpoint of you need to know I'm
[42:06] right and you're wrong. I need to
[42:07] approach this from the standpoint that
[42:08] there's a soul at issue.
[42:10] And the reason why I'm compelled to
[42:12] stand for truth is because my my soul is
[42:16] at rest in truth.
[42:18] And any soul that is not resting in
[42:19] truth is subject to judgment. And so I'm
[42:22] not arguing this and I'm not forceful
[42:24] about this to prove I'm right, but I do
[42:26] it because I love your soul.
[42:29] Hopefully we'll be able to touch on that
[42:31] maybe on Sunday on force, the use of
[42:32] force to accomplish something instead of
[42:34] love.
[42:36] Now notice how the scripture then brings
[42:37] it from the other side. Proverbs 29:24.
[42:39] Whoso is a partner with a thief hateth
[42:42] his own soul.
[42:44] Thieves LLC. Whosoever is a partner with
[42:47] a thief hateth his own soul. He heareth
[42:51] cursing and berth it not.
[42:55] There's a series in this.
[42:59] But notice he that gets wisdom loves his
[43:02] soul. But now somebody who is a partner
[43:04] with a thief, something dishonest and is
[43:07] joining together with something that is
[43:09] wicked that harms others. That's
[43:11] probably the most pro uh profound the
[43:15] most important aspect of this. Who
[43:17] someone who is a partner with a thief
[43:19] hateth his own soul. Someone who's going
[43:20] to join in with somebody else that harms
[43:23] somebody else hates his own soul.
[43:25] Doesn't love his soul properly. So then
[43:28] he whosoever gets wisdom loves his own
[43:30] soul. Love thy neighbor as thyself. If
[43:33] you are a partner with a thief and you
[43:34] would harm somebody else and not treat
[43:36] somebody else by by reverse, it shows
[43:39] that you don't love your own soul. You
[43:41] hate your own soul. He hears cursing and
[43:43] bereaith it not. He does not risk the
[43:46] consequences or he risks the
[43:47] consequences of the theft. He rises risk
[43:50] the consequences to himself and to
[43:52] others by not revealing the truth.
[43:56] By not stopping the fraud. He
[43:58] participates. He doesn't make it right.
[44:00] He he he hears the cursing. Oh, the
[44:02] loss, the harm. I've been agrieved. I've
[44:04] been harmed. What happened to my stuff?
[44:05] And he doesn't say, "Oh, I know. We took
[44:07] it in the middle of the night. Oh, I
[44:08] know. I'm sorry. Let us make you whole."
[44:10] He that is a partner with the thief
[44:12] hateth his own soul. He risk the damage.
[44:15] He risks the consequence to the person
[44:18] who's been robbed and the consequence to
[44:20] himself. And he participates. Instead of
[44:22] making it right, he says he betrayeth it
[44:24] not. Instead of revealing the truth, I'm
[44:25] sorry. Let me make it right.
[44:28] Wow.
[44:30] partner with a thief hates his own soul.
[44:32] But someone who gets wisdom, oh that
[44:34] your love would abound, yet get more and
[44:35] more and more knowledge and more
[44:36] judgment. To get wisdom is to love your
[44:39] own soul. To be a partner with something
[44:41] that harms somebody else betrays a
[44:44] hatred for your own soul.
[44:48] And you're talking about loving
[44:50] ourselves.
[44:52] I would be remiss to not mention 2
[44:54] Timothy chapter 3:es 1:2. Maybe this
[44:57] would be a footnote that someone could
[45:00] refer to if I was writing, but we'll
[45:02] we'll enter it into the record by
[45:04] reading it. This know also that in the
[45:06] last days perilous times shall come for
[45:08] men shall be lovers of their own selves.
[45:12] The lovers of their own selves. It's a
[45:14] phrasing. It's a word that does not
[45:16] relate in any way to agape love, but it
[45:18] is this selfish felio love. It's a love
[45:21] that is selfishly projected towards
[45:23] self. And as you continue to read the
[45:24] other characteristics of men in the last
[45:26] days, you'll find that Paul is
[45:28] correcting the selfish love, the bad
[45:31] pride, the kind of pride that acts to
[45:34] solely preserve the individual and would
[45:36] be willing to defraud somebody else in
[45:38] order to get what they felt like they
[45:40] deserved
[45:41] and that they want. And so this is
[45:43] something that would deprive and defraud
[45:45] and to cheat and to take away and even
[45:47] resort to to deceit if necessary because
[45:49] it always the ends justifies the means.
[45:52] This is to love yourself in a bad way,
[45:55] in a way that is not the kind of love
[45:57] that you would have for your neighbor.
[45:59] You take this, well, the men shall be
[46:02] lovers of themselves. Well, I I um I I I
[46:05] I love myself and I'd be willing to
[46:07] cheat and I'd be willing to rob and I'd
[46:08] be willing to steal to get whatever I
[46:10] want. That this is not the love of self
[46:12] that Jesus says we ought to have when we
[46:14] love our neighbors.
[46:17] You can see how there would certainly be
[46:18] an inongruence with that.
[46:20] So, Proverbs chapter 4 23 again maybe
[46:23] we're moving to another component. These
[46:24] things I feel just re so beautifully
[46:26] relate to the subject of barriers and
[46:28] boundaries.
[46:30] We touched on this on Sunday. Keep thy
[46:32] heart with all diligence for out of it
[46:34] are the issues of life.
[46:37] The issue of eternal life springs forth
[46:39] from the soul. Right.
[46:43] Uh oh.
[46:46] I think I'm starting a new series
[46:48] tomorrow morning. join my YouTube
[46:49] channel.
[46:51] We need to get on this very quickly.
[46:53] Eternal life exists within the soul.
[46:55] That's where it resides. When a man is
[46:57] born again by the baptism of the Holy
[46:58] Ghost, he the eternal life is sealed
[47:01] within the soul. And it thundered when I
[47:03] said that. And and so that's where
[47:06] that's where eternal life exists. That's
[47:08] where it resides. It resides within the
[47:10] soul. But now there is a sealing of the
[47:12] soul. But yet there's still a
[47:14] demonstration of guarding. Keep guard.
[47:16] Watch over your spirit, your heart with
[47:19] all diligence. Because now the issues of
[47:21] life come forward from the heart. We are
[47:24] tasked as parents to be protectors of
[47:26] and keepers of not so much our child's
[47:29] souls because the Holy Ghost is going to
[47:31] take care of that one day. We're to take
[47:33] care of the garden of their spirit
[47:35] because that's going to determine how
[47:36] effective the word can deal with the
[47:38] child's soul to be born again. How many
[47:40] things am I in the spirit am I having to
[47:42] root out? How many channels am I having
[47:43] to open back up? So we're protectors and
[47:45] we care for not the soul necessarily but
[47:48] the spirit of our children. And
[47:49] therefore we likewise as adults that we
[47:51] would have oversight over the nature of
[47:53] our children. We have the responsibility
[47:55] as Christians to guard our hearts to
[47:58] keep it blockaded to guard with fidelity
[48:01] to keep from dangers our spirits.
[48:04] The whole subject of barriers and
[48:06] boundaries is guarding your heart and
[48:07] controlling yourself. The entire subject
[48:10] this has been a this has been a
[48:11] scripture. This very next one I want to
[48:12] read in Proverbs 25 has been it before
[48:15] me from the very very beginning. These
[48:17] scriptures have been right before me.
[48:18] That the whole idea of barriers and
[48:20] boundaries revolves around this idea
[48:22] that I am required to by the word of God
[48:25] to keep my spirit from dangers. That
[48:28] there must be walls of protection that
[48:30] are built up about my heart that keep me
[48:32] pure in my thinking so I can be pure in
[48:34] my acting. That that keep me pure in my
[48:36] motives and pure in my objectives and
[48:38] pure in my spirit. And I must have
[48:40] protective boundaries set up, walled
[48:42] behind the word of God where I'm
[48:44] channeled correctly, I'm feeding
[48:45] correctly, so I can give the proper
[48:47] expression of the nature of Christ
[48:48] towards other people so that one day we
[48:50] can get out of here in a body change.
[48:55] And the other part is controlling
[48:56] yourself boundaries. It's about
[48:58] self-control.
[49:02] Proverbs chapter 25 27 to 28.
[49:06] It is not good to eat much honey.
[49:10] It's it's it's not it's good not to eat
[49:12] much honey. Not honey. It's it's good
[49:14] not to eat too much. It's not good to
[49:16] eat much honey. So for men to search
[49:20] their own glory is not glory.
[49:23] And in that eat too much honey, you're
[49:25] going to get sick. You seek after your
[49:27] own glory. That's not good. Going to
[49:29] make you sick. Comes back to that pride
[49:32] paradox.
[49:34] It it relates back to remove the beam
[49:37] from your own eye before you remove the
[49:38] moat from your brothers. The be the it's
[49:42] it's it's a it's a balancing. Verse 27,
[49:45] you could say it speaks of humility.
[49:46] It's good not to eat much honey. In the
[49:48] same way, it's good that you not search
[49:50] your own glory. It's a it's a good pride
[49:52] that recognizes limits. It's a good
[49:53] pride that doesn't want to elevate
[49:55] yourself beyond what you are. It's it's
[49:57] a pride that also sets boundaries. It's
[49:59] good not to eat too much honey, right?
[50:02] They say enough's enough. There needs to
[50:04] be moderation. There can't be excess and
[50:06] things can be okay, but there's a
[50:08] tipping point where it spills over into
[50:09] frivvality. It spills over into excess.
[50:11] So, I want to have the proper measure of
[50:13] things. Verse 27 is identifying in very
[50:16] few words a moderation, a a humility, a
[50:19] lack of excess. It's not good to eat
[50:21] much honey. So, for men to search their
[50:23] own glory is not glory.
[50:26] And this beautiful verse, he that
[50:28] ruleth, he that hath no rule over his
[50:31] own spirit is like a city that is broken
[50:34] down and without walls.
[50:36] I believe that they're necessarily
[50:38] connected together because verse 27's
[50:40] kind of to eat too much honey. You don't
[50:41] have any control.
[50:43] Oh, it tastes good, it tastes good. If
[50:44] it tastes good, it must be good. And
[50:45] it's kind of a point at which it spills
[50:47] over into excess that becomes
[50:49] detrimental. And and for men to seek
[50:51] their own glory is not glory. It's it's
[50:54] a something exceeding a bound. It
[50:57] exceeds a limit. So it says he that has
[50:59] no rule over his own spirit. That means
[51:01] he who has no self-control
[51:05] there. There's no fetterss on him.
[51:07] There's no fence about him there. He
[51:08] He's not within the due bounds. It's
[51:10] just like anything goes. No holds
[51:12] barred. However far this can take you,
[51:15] let it take you. A man who has no rule
[51:17] over spirit has no self-control.
[51:21] Just going to say whatever he wants to
[51:22] say. do whatever he wants to do and
[51:24] generally probably find an excuse for it
[51:26] in retrospect.
[51:29] But this self-government, this
[51:31] self-control is a mark of wisdom.
[51:33] Self-control, he that hath no rule over
[51:35] his own spirit. You read it in the
[51:37] context of the Proverbs, you find that
[51:38] it is lifting up this attribute of
[51:39] wisdom. This is essential to exercising
[51:42] wisdom. This is essential to a love
[51:44] which is abounding yet more and more in
[51:46] all knowledge and in all judgment. I
[51:48] have control over myself. Both to keep
[51:51] me from
[51:54] doing to keep me from doing something
[51:56] that's not right, but also to keep
[51:58] myself from harm.
[52:01] It says, "He that has control over his
[52:03] own spirit, he that ruleth his own
[52:04] spirit, he that hath no rule over his
[52:06] own spirit or no self-control is like a
[52:08] city without walls."
[52:11] That that's no, there's no distinction.
[52:13] Where does a city begin? Where does it
[52:14] end?
[52:16] There's no form of protection. There's
[52:17] no distinction of distinction of
[52:19] boundaries. There's no distinction of
[52:20] responsibility. There's no distinction
[52:22] of rights or privileges. It's like,
[52:23] well, do you have a right to do that? Is
[52:25] that yours? Is that something that you
[52:27] it's okay for you to do? Is this proper?
[52:29] Is this appropriate? Where there's a
[52:31] city without walls and there's no
[52:32] boundary that says this is the this is
[52:35] the area of jurisdiction. This is where
[52:37] you belong. Somebody without
[52:39] self-control, notice, has no protective
[52:42] barriers or protective boundaries and
[52:44] then has nothing stopping them from
[52:46] hurting others and infringing upon
[52:48] somebody else's rights.
[52:51] Walls represent fortification. It
[52:52] represents protection, safety, but also
[52:55] speaks of restraint and control.
[52:58] When you have a wall about a city, it's
[52:59] like this is where you live. This is
[53:00] what your house has walls. Your property
[53:02] has boundaries to establish this is
[53:04] where you respond. You cut the grass
[53:06] here. You rake the rocks here. Whatever
[53:07] it is you do, this is what you're
[53:09] responsible over. Without the fence,
[53:11] without the boundary line, somebody can
[53:12] infringe upon that. Somebody can build
[53:15] over that, cross over that. The
[53:17] boundary, the city without walls means I
[53:20] don't have protection, but I also don't
[53:21] have proper restraint.
[53:29] This guard of our hearts, look at these
[53:30] two scriptures together. Keep thy heart
[53:32] with all diligence
[53:34] and ruling our spirit like a city with
[53:36] walls. Guarding our hearts is part of
[53:38] ruling our spirits.
[53:41] It's part of building the right walls
[53:42] around our city, the habitation of the
[53:45] Holy Ghost, the the guardian of our
[53:47] spirits. Like I'm going to I'm going to
[53:49] be somebody who knows how to build walls
[53:52] in a positive way. I'm going to be
[53:54] somebody who knows how to define I want
[53:55] God to define who I am. I want God to
[53:57] define my calling. I want God to define
[53:59] my gift. It cannot be. Christianity is
[54:02] not just a free-for-all. Hey, who wants
[54:04] to preach Sunday? Hey, anybody, any
[54:05] sister, you want to preach? Okay, great.
[54:07] Wonderful. We got you down. I mean, just
[54:09] in the body of Christ, there are
[54:11] distinctions, different administrations,
[54:13] different gifts, different operations,
[54:14] different callings, different
[54:15] manifestations. Why? This is exactly how
[54:18] God has structured himself and manifest
[54:20] himself from the beginning. So, in order
[54:22] for you to be effective, you've got to
[54:23] know your place.
[54:26] And in my place, I can I can I I have a
[54:29] I'm tasked with responsibility. I must
[54:32] care for I'm a mother. I must care for
[54:34] the hearts of my children. I'm a
[54:36] husband. I must care for the wife, the
[54:38] heart of my wife. There's a there's a
[54:39] awakening awareness. I have this
[54:41] responsibility by the way that I'm being
[54:43] defined.
[54:46] Now, very very quickly, Jeremiah chapter
[54:49] 39,
[54:51] Jeremiah records the fall of Jerusalem
[54:53] in 586 BC. And the story, if you want to
[54:56] read it in Jeremiah 39, and where it's
[54:58] also uh elicited in the scripture,
[55:01] Zedekiah is is captured. His son is
[55:04] murdered. I believe Zedekiah is blinded.
[55:07] He's bound. He's dragged out of
[55:09] Jerusalem and carried away into Babylon.
[55:12] And it's not just the king, but the
[55:13] families are taken captive.
[55:16] A and person after person is being
[55:19] carried away into Babylon. And this is
[55:20] how it's described in verse 8. And the
[55:21] Calaldanss burned the king's house and
[55:23] the houses of the people with fire. And
[55:25] this is a very symbolic act. And break
[55:27] down the walls of Jerusalem.
[55:30] This is a this is a symbolic act by the
[55:33] Caldanss to say you are destroyed.
[55:37] You do not you no longer exist. When the
[55:40] walls are torn down, the identity is
[55:42] lost. The protection's gone. The res the
[55:44] the power is gone. The restraint is
[55:46] gone. The definition is gone to break
[55:48] down the walls of Jerusalem. uh if they
[55:50] had not even taken all the lives and
[55:52] carried the children out then and left
[55:54] them there but tore down the walls that
[55:56] in itself is symbolic of you have been
[55:58] conquered you have been destroyed
[56:01] and the Bible is telling us that if you
[56:03] have rule over your spirit the inverse
[56:06] is that you are like a city that has
[56:08] walls that are not broken down but he
[56:10] that cannot rule over his own spirit is
[56:12] like a city that is broken down and
[56:14] without walls this is the state of
[56:15] Jerusalem
[56:17] the enemy besets it tears down the walls
[56:19] to to demonstrate you are now powerless.
[56:22] You are now you do not have protection.
[56:24] You are no longer clearly defined. You
[56:26] are now laid waste as rubble. Where did
[56:28] it begin? Where does it end? Where where
[56:29] was this? Where was that? It's been
[56:31] destroyed just as Jericho was.
[56:34] And I'd like for you to think very
[56:36] quickly and maybe I'm going to be using
[56:38] quickly a lot now just to try to hurry
[56:39] your thinking, but to think that
[56:42] Jerusalem then I'd like to identify it
[56:45] as a type of our life.
[56:48] that in this sense, Jerusalem is
[56:49] representative of our life. But you're
[56:50] you're person. You are Jerusalem. You
[56:52] are the you are the dwelling place of
[56:54] the Holy Ghost. Jerusalem can be
[56:56] reflective of our homes and our
[56:57] families. There's a beautiful image that
[56:59] is expressed in Jerusalem. It is a post
[57:02] of duty. It's representative of of
[57:04] responsibility.
[57:05] When when the exiles were going back in
[57:07] the book of Ezra and Nehemiah to go back
[57:10] to worship, what was the first thing
[57:11] they built back up? The walls.
[57:15] uh because it represented it rep it's
[57:17] the symbolic nature of it what it
[57:18] represents ownership and restoration and
[57:21] protection and they all were gathered
[57:23] along on the wall and they each had a
[57:25] place on the wall and they each had a
[57:26] responsibility from the dung gate to the
[57:28] fish gate and each one had this ch you
[57:29] have to be in your place working each
[57:32] one along the wall to accomplish this
[57:34] restoration of Jerusalem and so there's
[57:36] a there's this image that Jerusalem
[57:38] represents for me my responsibility
[57:42] Jesus even says in Luke 24:47 and that
[57:44] repentance or remissions of sins should
[57:46] be preached in his name among all
[57:48] nations. But where does it start?
[57:50] Beginning at Jerusalem. Before you can
[57:53] ever be effective in another nation, you
[57:55] have to first be effective in your fir
[57:57] where you are.
[57:59] You have to start with yourself. We have
[58:01] to as a church, I I would desire that we
[58:04] could develop a very healthy vision for
[58:06] missions. But we cannot get it out of
[58:09] order to where we become so focused on
[58:11] missions and all about missions and
[58:12] lifting up missions. But we haven't
[58:14] first established our calling and our
[58:17] faithfulness here in Jerusalem.
[58:20] Those in Tucson may call us Jericho, but
[58:23] we have a responsibility to Jerusalem
[58:26] first, beginning at Jerusalem. Charity
[58:28] begins at home. Our responsibility first
[58:31] begins with our self. So if you want to
[58:34] look at it as an individual, if you want
[58:36] to look at it as a family, if you want
[58:37] to look at it as a church, however it is
[58:38] you want to look at it, we must build
[58:40] our walls,
[58:42] we must control ourselves
[58:45] because if you can control yourself, you
[58:47] you can control others without being
[58:49] manipulative,
[58:50] right? If you can't control yourself,
[58:52] you're more than likely going to try to
[58:54] uh in a in an impure way control others.
[58:57] We must control ourselves. We must
[58:59] protect our hearts. We must build our
[59:00] walls. I build a wall to protect myself.
[59:03] But I also build a wall to remind myself
[59:06] this is my place. This is my calling. I
[59:08] can't step outside of that because if I
[59:10] do, I infringe upon somebody else or I
[59:12] grieve the Holy Spirit or I do something
[59:14] to offend.
[59:16] That's what the walls do to me.
[59:19] It keeps our hearts, it keeps our
[59:21] spirits free, our hearts clean.
[59:25] Remember this. We referenced it here
[59:28] recently. It's the reason why the word
[59:30] of God, reason why the Bible, the
[59:32] message emphasizes so often requires a
[59:35] sanctification.
[59:37] It's why there's so many things that are
[59:38] very precise and detailed in the message
[59:40] of the hour as it relates to applying
[59:42] the token as it relates to certain
[59:44] entertainments as it relates to certain
[59:45] conduct as Paul would outline it. The
[59:47] reason why the Bible requires requires
[59:49] sanctification, it's so that our spirits
[59:51] remain free.
[59:54] the love of God in our heart, the power
[59:56] of God, eternal life, the word of God in
[59:57] our in our souls, it wants to act and it
[1:00:01] cannot run up against a barrier in our
[1:00:03] spirit that's been placed there has been
[1:00:06] swn there by the things of this world.
[1:00:10] It's important that our spirits remain
[1:00:12] free. In Proverbs chapter 16:32,
[1:00:15] he that is slow to anger is better than
[1:00:17] the mighty.
[1:00:19] And he that ruleth his spirit than he
[1:00:21] that taketh the city.
[1:00:23] Notice the continuity with Proverbs 25.
[1:00:26] He that hath no rule over his own spirit
[1:00:28] is like a city that is broken down and
[1:00:29] without walls. Earlier the proverb had
[1:00:32] been written that if you're slow to
[1:00:33] anger, you're you're better than the
[1:00:35] mighty. If you're not quick quickly
[1:00:37] angered, self-control, this temperance I
[1:00:40] I if you can't be easily incited, if
[1:00:43] you're slow to anger, you're better,
[1:00:46] more powerful, more skilled, however
[1:00:49] you'd want to use, but you're better
[1:00:50] than someone who's strong or powerful.
[1:00:51] Someone who might have might, someone
[1:00:53] who might have a loud voice, someone who
[1:00:54] might be able to bite your head off,
[1:00:56] someone who can always kind of get you
[1:00:57] back, you know, somebody who's uh uh uh
[1:01:00] who can push you over. If you're slow to
[1:01:02] anger, you're stronger than somebody who
[1:01:04] thinks they can push you over. And he
[1:01:07] that controls has self-control. He that
[1:01:10] ruleth the spirit is better than he that
[1:01:12] taketh a city.
[1:01:15] Again, I do not mean to do these verses
[1:01:17] any disservice by quickly making an
[1:01:20] application of it. But he that is slow
[1:01:22] to anger and can control his spirit. He
[1:01:24] who sets boundaries and stays within him
[1:01:27] is stronger than one who can disrespect
[1:01:29] him and try to push him down.
[1:01:32] It says you're you're you're better than
[1:01:33] someone who can take a city. You're
[1:01:35] better than someone who can tear down a
[1:01:36] wall. You're better than someone who can
[1:01:37] leap over a wall. You're better than
[1:01:38] somebody who has a way of tearing
[1:01:40] something down in violating and
[1:01:41] trespassing. He who can tear down the
[1:01:43] walls of a city. Oh my, that's somebody
[1:01:45] who's powerful. But the person who can
[1:01:47] set a boundary and stay within it is
[1:01:49] mightier and better than somebody who
[1:01:51] knows how to get around it. But I know
[1:01:53] it's the ones that get around it that
[1:01:54] get all the air time. But the one who
[1:01:56] knows how to stay in his lane and stay
[1:01:57] in his place, he's better.
[1:02:02] So David in Psalms 51:18
[1:02:15] just weighing if I should continue but I
[1:02:17] will use this Psalm 51:18
[1:02:20] in your Bibles it may say the Psalm of
[1:02:22] David you're reading look at the top
[1:02:24] whatever reference it it's the Psalm of
[1:02:26] David when Nathan the prophet came to
[1:02:30] And what did he tell him? That man is
[1:02:32] you, David.
[1:02:34] You're the one who had all the sheep and
[1:02:36] took the one from the man who only had
[1:02:37] one. You're the one what you did to
[1:02:39] Uriah, what you did to Ba' Sheba. This
[1:02:41] is Na after Nathan the prophet had come
[1:02:43] to him after he'd gone into Ba'ath
[1:02:44] Sheba. So think of this failure, this
[1:02:46] sinning of a king and the time when
[1:02:48] kings went to war. David stayed behind
[1:02:50] his men are on the battlefield. Just
[1:02:52] think of this sin, this trespass of
[1:02:54] David. And notice what his prayer is.
[1:02:56] Psalm 51:18. Do good in thy good
[1:03:00] pleasure unto Zion.
[1:03:02] Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
[1:03:06] David recognized that some something had
[1:03:08] been transgressed. Something had been
[1:03:11] torn down. It's symbolic of a a
[1:03:14] violation. It's symbolic of a a lack of
[1:03:16] protection. Oh, he's saying, "Build back
[1:03:18] up the walls.
[1:03:20] Build them up again."
[1:03:27] That's how we ought to be.
[1:03:31] We are responsible for guarding our
[1:03:32] hearts.
[1:03:34] We're responsible for keeping our
[1:03:35] spirits clean. We are responsible for
[1:03:38] preserving virtue.
[1:03:40] I have to just make very quick reference
[1:03:42] to it in verse 6. Matthew chapter 7
[1:03:44] verse 6. Give not that which is holy
[1:03:45] unto dogs, neither cast you your pearls
[1:03:47] before swine, lest they trample them
[1:03:49] under their feet and turn again and rend
[1:03:51] you.
[1:03:53] Now, I'm I would be I would be more than
[1:03:57] happy to sign up to hear like brother
[1:03:59] Tim Dodd do a series on that. I want to
[1:04:01] know more about what this means. I want
[1:04:03] to understand better. Uh, you know, kind
[1:04:05] of develop this for me. I want to know
[1:04:08] exactly what this means. But just
[1:04:09] looking at it at its face, we have a
[1:04:12] commandment. We have a commission to
[1:04:14] project love correctly.
[1:04:17] That there there has to be something
[1:04:18] very accurate in how we're dispersing
[1:04:20] that. give not that which is holy unto
[1:04:22] dogs. That means we we can't just be
[1:04:25] indiscriminate there. This is this is
[1:04:27] the moderation and the measurement of
[1:04:29] conduct on some level. If I'm not
[1:04:31] getting the specifics of it, we look at
[1:04:33] it and say, "Oh, look at this. I'm being
[1:04:35] told to measure myself. Once I've
[1:04:37] removed the beam from my eye, now I can
[1:04:39] see without hypocrisy. So now I'm not to
[1:04:42] give that which is holy to dogs. I'm not
[1:04:44] to cast my pearls before swine, lest
[1:04:46] they trample under their feet, and turn
[1:04:47] again and rend you." Jesus is using this
[1:04:51] in the subject of reproof. And he's
[1:04:52] saying that we should be cautious. We
[1:04:54] should be very prudent. Whom we rebuke,
[1:04:56] who we commend, who we admonish. You
[1:04:58] have to be very careful because it's not
[1:04:59] like, oh, let's just all hold hands and
[1:05:01] sing kumbaya. You've got to know what
[1:05:03] you're doing.
[1:05:05] You've got to know exactly what you're
[1:05:06] doing. You can't you can't have a a beam
[1:05:09] in your eye trying to remove someone's
[1:05:11] mo. Once you've gotten that hypocrisy
[1:05:12] out of the way, once you can love
[1:05:14] yourself, now you can project love of
[1:05:16] God correctly and know that it's not
[1:05:18] just this warm fuzzy feeling because I
[1:05:20] know the love that God has for me. I
[1:05:22] know the love I have for him. And it's
[1:05:24] zealous about the word. It's zealous
[1:05:26] about truth and it's concerned about the
[1:05:28] soul. So Jesus when he looked at the
[1:05:29] rich young ruler and it says he loved
[1:05:31] him, it doesn't mean he loved him like a
[1:05:33] father does a son. The verb, it's a word
[1:05:35] saying he projected love to him. How did
[1:05:38] he project love to him? by telling him
[1:05:40] what he lacked.
[1:05:52] You know, when he says, "Give not that
[1:05:54] which is holy unto dogs, neither cast
[1:05:56] your pearls before swine," does that not
[1:05:58] give you pause? Now, I know we use this
[1:06:00] a lot in in in not doing something nice.
[1:06:03] Well, I'm not going to cast my pearls
[1:06:04] before swine. Well, you better be sure
[1:06:06] you're doing it right. You better be be
[1:06:08] sure you know what you're talking about.
[1:06:10] You can't just be withholding what is
[1:06:12] due, what someone deserves, and what
[1:06:13] what's proper, what's right, and say,
[1:06:15] "I'm not c I'm not going to cast my
[1:06:16] pearls before swine
[1:06:19] a and and act as if you fulfilled the
[1:06:22] word of God." When you're defrauding
[1:06:24] somebody,
[1:06:26] when you're doing it out of spite,
[1:06:27] you're doing it for all the wrong
[1:06:28] reasons. Because then you turn right
[1:06:29] around and you're just heaping coals on
[1:06:31] someone's head, right? When you do
[1:06:32] something right, go, "I'm just doing it
[1:06:33] to heap coals on their head." Well,
[1:06:34] maybe you shouldn't have cast your
[1:06:35] pearls before it's swine.
[1:06:43] We We insult people when we try to force
[1:06:45] truth on those who can't value it.
[1:06:56] So, you got to know when to say yes.
[1:06:58] You got to know when to say no.
[1:07:01] It's exactly what Jesus is talking
[1:07:03] about. I've got that which is holy. I've
[1:07:05] got pearls. I got to know when to give,
[1:07:09] when to cast, and when not to. I've got
[1:07:12] to know that. How in the world am I ever
[1:07:15] going to know to do that correctly
[1:07:16] unless I'm able to see my neighbor in
[1:07:18] his need and what he requires and what's
[1:07:21] necessary?
[1:07:23] As I've fellowshipped on it with some
[1:07:24] this week, as you've pondered it maybe
[1:07:27] yourselves, is this Moses at the Red Sea
[1:07:31] or Elijah under the juniper tree?
[1:07:33] Who am I dealing with? What do they
[1:07:36] need? What's right, Lord? Lord, I can
[1:07:37] think of so many things to say. I could
[1:07:39] think of so many things to do. I I I'm
[1:07:41] getting this righteous indignation. I'm
[1:07:43] feeling very, very weak and restrained.
[1:07:44] Lord, what how should I act in this
[1:07:46] situation? Is it time to speak or is it
[1:07:48] time to hold my peace?
[1:07:51] There's a time to say yes. There's a
[1:07:52] time to say no. And Jesus said, "Let
[1:07:55] your yay be yay and your nay be nay."
[1:07:58] Be clear. Be decisive. Don't equivocate.
[1:08:00] Don't don't blur the lines. Stand
[1:08:02] steadfast, but let your communication be
[1:08:04] yay yay nay nay. For whatsoever is more
[1:08:07] than these cometh of evil. I thought I
[1:08:10] wasn't going to I thought I was going to
[1:08:11] skip this. I'm just going to get through
[1:08:12] it. Uh uh and and I'm and I'm I'm
[1:08:15] grateful to be able to just touch on
[1:08:16] this. If it deserves more attention, we
[1:08:18] could circle back to it. Jesus is is
[1:08:22] talking about something much deeper than
[1:08:23] this, much broader than this. But notice
[1:08:25] the principle he's using to express
[1:08:28] this. Let your yay be yay, your nay be
[1:08:30] nay. For whatsoever is more than yes and
[1:08:33] no
[1:08:35] comes comes evil. In other words, the
[1:08:38] yes or no is enough,
[1:08:40] right?
[1:08:40] To be clear, to be decisive, to not
[1:08:43] hemhaul and and to offer other excuses
[1:08:45] and try to come up with all these
[1:08:47] reasons. There's no need to go beyond
[1:08:49] what is necessary to to go beyond a yes,
[1:08:52] to go beyond a no. To go beyond the yes
[1:08:54] of the word that come, you're going to
[1:08:55] get into evil. to go beyond the no of
[1:08:57] the word, you're going to get an evil.
[1:08:58] You if to go beyond the yay and the nay
[1:09:01] is is leads into unnecessary
[1:09:04] justifications that then kind of survive
[1:09:07] and get misused.
[1:09:10] I really I really I I'm I'm going to
[1:09:13] apologize even though I shouldn't for
[1:09:15] kind of putting that out there because
[1:09:16] that's a large chunk to chew on. If we
[1:09:18] go beyond the yay of the word and the
[1:09:20] nay of the word with these unnecessary
[1:09:23] justifications, the unnecessary
[1:09:24] justifications survive and then are
[1:09:26] misused.
[1:09:30] We wait we we try to turn something
[1:09:31] around. Well, also this. If he said this
[1:09:33] about that, then couldn't we also say it
[1:09:35] about this? And then that kind of that
[1:09:36] kind of shadow, that myth survives. And
[1:09:38] what does that become? It becomes a
[1:09:40] barrier to the yay. It becomes a barrier
[1:09:42] to the nay. It becomes a barrier to
[1:09:44] fully appreciate that when God says
[1:09:46] something, he means it. And that's what
[1:09:48] it is
[1:09:50] without our rationalization,
[1:09:51] justification, without our trying to
[1:09:53] figure it out.
[1:09:56] As James comes back to it in James
[1:09:57] chapter 5:12, again, in the context of
[1:09:59] this, it merits much more attention. But
[1:10:01] above all things, my brethren, swear
[1:10:03] not, neither by heaven, neither by
[1:10:04] earth, neither by any other oath, but
[1:10:06] let your yay be yay, and your nay nay,
[1:10:09] lest ye fall into condemnation.
[1:10:12] Let your word stand firm. Let your
[1:10:15] decision be clearcut. Let it be
[1:10:17] decisive. Let let it be let people know
[1:10:20] where you stand on something. And if
[1:10:22] you're talking about judgment and and
[1:10:24] right and correctness, be sure you know
[1:10:26] where you're standing because by
[1:10:28] whatever measurement you're going to
[1:10:29] measure out, you're going to be measured
[1:10:30] by also. So therefore, Lord, I measure
[1:10:32] myself by your word. Let the plum line
[1:10:35] of your word, may I be measured up
[1:10:37] against it. May that be what I measure
[1:10:39] others by because it is inescapable and
[1:10:41] unavoidable that I myself am going to be
[1:10:44] measured by the word. I'm going to be
[1:10:46] judged by the word. So that's the
[1:10:48] standard by which I will measure my life
[1:10:50] and others.
[1:10:52] Therefore, let my yay be yay and your
[1:10:54] nay nay. You got to know when to say
[1:10:56] yes. You got to know when to say no. And
[1:10:58] you got to be sure that you stick with
[1:11:00] the yes and stick with the no because
[1:11:02] anything else becomes a barrier, not a
[1:11:04] boundary.
[1:11:06] I've said it many, many times and my
[1:11:08] lovely wife and I have been talking a
[1:11:10] lot about it just through personal
[1:11:11] things and decisions we have to face and
[1:11:13] circumstances we find ourselves in that
[1:11:15] the barriers are always so quickly to
[1:11:17] grab a hold of right there. They're just
[1:11:21] they're just right they're everywhere.
[1:11:22] Oh, I don't want that throw barrier up.
[1:11:24] I don't want that throw a barrier up.
[1:11:25] But if you're ever going to properly
[1:11:26] guide your children's heart, if you're
[1:11:28] ever going to find that place where you
[1:11:29] can thrive, you got to know where the
[1:11:30] boundaries are because those remain.
[1:11:34] The Bible tells us we can run through a
[1:11:36] troop and leap over a wall. We're made
[1:11:38] We're made We're made to to leap over
[1:11:41] things that are in the way of progress.
[1:11:42] We're made to power through things and
[1:11:44] to fly above things and work through
[1:11:46] things that stand in the way of
[1:11:47] progress. And so if we signal the wrong
[1:11:49] thing to a brother or sister who means
[1:11:51] well and we throw up a barrier, they're
[1:11:52] going to say, "Brother or sister, no,
[1:11:53] that's a barrier. I'm coming after you.
[1:11:55] I'm going to come into that. I'm going
[1:11:56] to rescue you. I want to help you." And
[1:11:58] what we do is we throw up a barrier and
[1:11:59] we give the wrong signal when we should
[1:12:01] be yay or nay. And they know that's a
[1:12:03] boundary, not a barrier.
[1:12:11] We are responsible for guarding our
[1:12:13] hearts. We are responsible for keeping
[1:12:14] our spirits. We are responsible. I've
[1:12:17] been chasing after this quote from the
[1:12:18] very beginning. We are responsible to
[1:12:21] protect something,
[1:12:24] something very precious. How in the
[1:12:26] world could Jesus ask us to love our
[1:12:29] neighbor as we love oursel if there
[1:12:31] wasn't a beautiful mystery in who you
[1:12:33] are?
[1:12:35] How could he do it? How could he say
[1:12:36] that that there would be any merit and
[1:12:38] value in loving God with your soul,
[1:12:40] mind, and spirit? What what would there
[1:12:42] be any merit and value in that unless
[1:12:44] there was something precious and how God
[1:12:46] made you and formed you? And how is it
[1:12:49] he could ask you to love your neighbor
[1:12:51] as you love yourself if there was a be
[1:12:54] wasn't a beautiful mystery in who you
[1:12:55] are
[1:12:58] and that in loving myself correctly and
[1:13:00] loving God correctly that there there's
[1:13:02] these omnipotence are meeting and
[1:13:04] there's something that can be expressed
[1:13:06] and there's something that can be
[1:13:07] conveyed. How how many have gone back
[1:13:09] over the last few weeks and maybe
[1:13:10] listened to when divine love is
[1:13:11] projected or when love is projected or
[1:13:13] pondered these stories of when brother
[1:13:15] Brandham found himself in a difficult
[1:13:17] situation. He stirred up a hornets's
[1:13:19] nest or he angry a he angered a bull and
[1:13:21] he could actually project love and it
[1:13:24] changed things when there's been a
[1:13:26] violation when there's been an upsetting
[1:13:28] when something's been transgressed that
[1:13:30] love can be projected. Oh, there's a
[1:13:32] love that must be project from projected
[1:13:34] from our hearts
[1:13:38] and it's all it's about love having
[1:13:40] these limits. It's about loving myself
[1:13:42] correctly and then loving the nature and
[1:13:44] the soul of somebody else to where I
[1:13:46] just don't want them to feel good about
[1:13:47] themselves. I just don't want them this
[1:13:48] warm fuzzy feeling. I don't just want us
[1:13:50] all to get along, but oh God, there's a
[1:13:52] there's something at stake here. There's
[1:13:54] a loss. There's a there's something.
[1:13:56] It's a burden that we ought to have for
[1:13:57] lost souls. It's a burden we ought to
[1:13:59] have for families that we don't see.
[1:14:01] Maybe they come by and then they're
[1:14:02] missing. It's a burden we ought to have
[1:14:03] for family. It's a burden. Not because
[1:14:05] we're offended or not because we
[1:14:07] shouldn't be treated some way, but
[1:14:09] that's not that's not going to give them
[1:14:11] the kingdom.
[1:14:13] I found myself in a situation one time
[1:14:15] where I wanted to run. I wanted to run.
[1:14:17] I just wanted to disappear in the middle
[1:14:18] of the night. And God smoked my heart
[1:14:19] and said, "If you do that, you they risk
[1:14:22] the loss of their soul." You have to
[1:14:25] stand and face some things sometimes,
[1:14:27] not for your own integrity, but out of
[1:14:29] love for someone's soul.
[1:14:36] and invisible union. I I you're pulling
[1:14:40] me unto these things. Maybe I've taken a
[1:14:42] step beyond this, but let me come back
[1:14:44] to it. We have something we must
[1:14:46] protect. There's something beautiful
[1:14:47] about the love of God that's been placed
[1:14:49] in your soul. There's something
[1:14:50] beautiful about what he's doing in your
[1:14:51] spirit and we must preserve it.
[1:14:54] Brother Benham says in the message
[1:14:55] invisible union about the bride about
[1:14:58] the woman well about the woman and then
[1:15:00] by uh analogy to the elect she has a
[1:15:04] sacred trust of virtue that's given her
[1:15:07] trusted to her by the Lord.
[1:15:10] God gave her that virtue just as it was
[1:15:12] in the garden of Eden. She can say yes
[1:15:14] or no.
[1:15:16] Notice that the virtue is protected. The
[1:15:20] virtue is guarded by a yay or a nay. She
[1:15:24] has a sacred trust of womanhood
[1:15:26] committed to her that she must not
[1:15:29] break. If I could put it this way, every
[1:15:32] single one of us, man or woman, boy or
[1:15:34] girl, son or daughter of God, you have
[1:15:36] been entrusted with a virtue. There's a
[1:15:39] sacred trust of virtue. There's a sacred
[1:15:41] trust of Christianhood. There's a sacred
[1:15:43] trust of deity. There's a sacred trust
[1:15:45] of Christianity that's been granted to
[1:15:47] you that we must not break and we
[1:15:50] protect it in the yes or the no.
[1:15:54] He says in paragraph 77, I apologize I
[1:15:56] don't have these here. She has also been
[1:15:58] given a sacred charge from God. And you
[1:16:01] should be able to finish this for
[1:16:02] redemption.
[1:16:04] The bride, the woman, the the the the
[1:16:06] place that the elect have today is a
[1:16:08] sacred charge from God. I have a sacred
[1:16:11] charge. I must guard this. I might must
[1:16:13] protect this. Well, why? Because
[1:16:15] redemption's bound up in it. If I don't
[1:16:17] protect it, there is no redemption. I am
[1:16:20] a bedding ground. I'm the place from
[1:16:21] which life's going to come forth. If the
[1:16:23] full word's going to be born into
[1:16:25] manifestation, it's going to come from
[1:16:26] the bedding ground of who I am as a son
[1:16:29] or daughter of God. So, I must protect
[1:16:31] this.
[1:16:32] I must guard this. I must be very, very
[1:16:35] uh circumspect about it. I can't be f
[1:16:38] frivolous. I can't be uh I I can't be
[1:16:40] loose in the way that I think and the
[1:16:42] way that I live because I have been
[1:16:44] given a charge in this end time to
[1:16:47] express something very valuable and very
[1:16:48] precious.
[1:16:51] A sacred charge from God for redemption.
[1:16:53] She's got character she must not defile.
[1:16:55] You're familiar with these statements,
[1:16:56] are you not?
[1:16:58] And he says in paragraph 101, "What a
[1:17:00] sacred trust. What a responsibility to a
[1:17:02] woman." Now see why she's a type of the
[1:17:05] church which has the same
[1:17:07] responsibility.
[1:17:09] And what's the church? Is it the Hilton
[1:17:11] Garden end in this conference room that
[1:17:12] we have here? Is that it? No. It's you.
[1:17:15] It's your heart. It's your testimony.
[1:17:17] It's your character.
[1:17:19] We spoke at a ministers meeting here
[1:17:21] last year on the the the subject matter
[1:17:24] was the five true identificate
[1:17:27] identifications of the true church of
[1:17:29] the living God. A and and my thesis was
[1:17:33] the local church is not the true church,
[1:17:36] but it exists to serve those who are
[1:17:39] part of it.
[1:17:42] And you are individually those that make
[1:17:44] up the true church of the living God.
[1:17:46] Therefore, you have a responsibility.
[1:17:49] You have a sacred trust of virtue, a
[1:17:51] sacred trust of Christianity, a sacred
[1:17:54] charge from God for redemption,
[1:17:55] characters that you must not defile.
[1:17:57] When we when we're discussing the
[1:18:00] importance of having boundaries, it's
[1:18:02] not so that you can somehow protect your
[1:18:04] spirit so that you're navigating
[1:18:06] relationships without bitterness and
[1:18:07] jealousy alone. It's because you have a
[1:18:09] sacred charge from God for redemption.
[1:18:12] Know ye not that you judge are going to
[1:18:14] judge the world? Do you not realize that
[1:18:16] you stand in place right now where
[1:18:18] you're being judged by the word of God
[1:18:20] right now? This is where you take your
[1:18:22] judgment. This is where you're being
[1:18:24] corrected. Oh, I want to feel. I want to
[1:18:26] know. I want to experience this
[1:18:28] corrective love that's coming forth from
[1:18:31] this open book. And I want to relate to
[1:18:32] it. I want to know it. I want to feel
[1:18:34] it. I want to I want to take it into my
[1:18:36] bosom and say, "God, I'm not afraid of
[1:18:39] how you might correct me. I'm not afraid
[1:18:41] of how you might guide me. I'm not
[1:18:42] afraid of your love for me. Therefore, I
[1:18:44] am not afraid to love others as I love
[1:18:47] myself
[1:18:49] because I have a sacred charge. I have a
[1:18:52] I have a virtue that I must protect. Uh,
[1:18:54] please stand together with me.
[1:18:57] Brothers, if you could come to your
[1:18:59] instruments.
[1:19:01] Brother Matthew, if you could come and
[1:19:04] play. Brother Michael, if you could get
[1:19:05] ready. I've just turned it over maybe
[1:19:08] here in a moment.
[1:19:10] I'm just uh
[1:19:16] I I I said it was gumbo
[1:19:19] before I started, but that's because I
[1:19:21] was looking at it carnally. As God put
[1:19:24] it all together, I say it's beautiful.
[1:19:28] I I I I see something precious for
[1:19:30] myself in this.
[1:19:32] And I hope that you can you can take all
[1:19:35] the all the ingredients and find
[1:19:38] something very very precious and
[1:19:41] strength-giving in this. Can you
[1:19:42] tonight? There's something you can take
[1:19:44] and say, "Lord, this this resonates
[1:19:46] within my within my person of something
[1:19:50] very precious and valuable."
[1:19:53] And and we may emphasize it quite a bit
[1:19:55] here,
[1:19:57] but this is
[1:20:00] what else is meant when brother Brandham
[1:20:03] talks about recognizing who we are.
[1:20:07] What else is meant than to see yourself
[1:20:10] as he sees you in all your glory and all
[1:20:13] your splendor and all your perfectness?
[1:20:17] What else would be meant by it? Is it to
[1:20:19] is it to see yourself exactly as you are
[1:20:21] and you kind of look back through your
[1:20:22] Facebook history and your timeline like
[1:20:25] oh man
[1:20:27] and you you become the sum of all your
[1:20:29] posts.
[1:20:31] You become a sum of all your pictures.
[1:20:32] You become a sum of all your past. And
[1:20:34] here I stand here today kind of like,
[1:20:36] well, I'm just the sum of all my
[1:20:37] failures. I'm always living under the
[1:20:39] under the the shadow of my past
[1:20:41] mistakes. I'm defined by the decisions I
[1:20:44] made when I didn't know better. defined
[1:20:46] by the the my weak moments when I gave
[1:20:48] in to temptation. I'm I'm defined by all
[1:20:51] these things. Or is there something
[1:20:52] that's happened that's opened up to you
[1:20:55] that translates you beyond the history
[1:20:59] that the memory can recall into the mind
[1:21:02] of God and say there there's my identity
[1:21:05] not in the flesh but in that part that
[1:21:07] came elected from God.
[1:21:09] Pray for me if God would allow me. I
[1:21:11] want to very soon start a subject of I
[1:21:13] am an open book.
[1:21:16] and to see ourselves in the word of God
[1:21:18] for what he's called us to be. And
[1:21:20] that's the only place to live. The only
[1:21:24] place to live is is who you are in God's
[1:21:27] word. And oh, with that, please help me
[1:21:31] to see others the right way. Heavenly
[1:21:34] Father,
[1:21:35] when it's so hard to get beyond
[1:21:37] ourselves, our own emotions, our own
[1:21:39] feelings, our own hurts and
[1:21:40] frustrations,
[1:21:43] it's as if we turned away from the
[1:21:45] looking glass,
[1:21:48] and we let our minds
[1:21:50] paint a picture that's so cruel and
[1:21:53] dark.
[1:21:57] Lord, I'm willing to look back in that
[1:21:59] mirror tonight
[1:22:03] and to see myself in your word,
[1:22:07] not feelings, not
[1:22:11] anxiety.
[1:22:15] And I I I'm personally expressing this
[1:22:18] to you, Lord, as your son, that as I've
[1:22:20] mentioned it to our church.
[1:22:24] I I want to I want to see others
[1:22:27] I want to see the people I preach to,
[1:22:29] how you see them.
[1:22:33] I want to be I want to be faithful
[1:22:36] to
[1:22:38] to how you would treat them, Lord.
[1:22:43] And how can I ever get around to that
[1:22:48] if something's out of place
[1:22:52] in my love for you.
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:23:01] Take every every veil, every curtain,
[1:23:04] every barrier, every door.
[1:23:08] tear them down, Lord,
[1:23:11] that I could see you face to face.
[1:23:15] And in the awesomeness of your presence
[1:23:17] tonight, Lord, I desire that there could
[1:23:19] be a healing
[1:23:22] and a
[1:23:24] a
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:29] restoration of strength and virtue
[1:23:32] that would give us more courage. Lord,
[1:23:39] Lord, as I fellowshipped with the
[1:23:42] pastor yesterday in a phone call
[1:23:46] just burying his heart and sharing
[1:23:50] this picture of a husband and wife that
[1:23:53] face difficult a difficult challenge and
[1:23:56] can take one another by the hand and
[1:23:58] say, "Let us face this bravely with the
[1:24:01] character of Christ. Let us love as you
[1:24:04] would love and let us be the very
[1:24:06] heartbeat of God, the very the very
[1:24:08] pulse and the very rhythm of your word
[1:24:10] that it would speak something to the
[1:24:13] other person
[1:24:15] that would that would not only express
[1:24:17] and indicate the confidence that they
[1:24:19] would have that couple would have in you
[1:24:21] and that confidence they would have in
[1:24:22] your word and their position in Christ,
[1:24:24] but it it could exude something to the
[1:24:26] other that they could realize something
[1:24:29] that's lacking in themselves.
[1:24:32] Because Lord, we would never want to act
[1:24:33] to shame somebody for the purpose of
[1:24:35] shame alone. We would never lay them
[1:24:37] bare and strip them naked to to mock
[1:24:40] their nakedness, Lord. But there are
[1:24:42] things that we would want them to lose
[1:24:46] so that they could find you.
[1:24:50] And may we not be afraid to to go
[1:24:53] forward, Lord. And I I I wrestle in my
[1:24:56] heart, Lord, and
[1:24:59] fight up against so many different
[1:25:01] things. is looking at this subject
[1:25:02] matter and I know in my spirit I'm very
[1:25:04] near just moving beyond this but there
[1:25:07] there there's specifics and there's
[1:25:09] applications of this and Lord I feel
[1:25:12] restrained and not be too precise and
[1:25:14] too specific lest the whole the the
[1:25:16] general principle be lost. So I ask now,
[1:25:18] Lord, that you could enlighten your
[1:25:21] children to what this looks like in
[1:25:24] everyday life.
[1:25:28] I'm going to commit it to you now, Lord,
[1:25:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:31] Amen.
[1:25:33] Amen. God bless you.
