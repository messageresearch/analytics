TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is the I think it's the 14th service that we've had on the subject of the house of the Lord and I'm hoping that there's some continuity among the different parts that we've gone through and the different subjects that we've addressed um I've just kind of been looking back over it we've covered a lot there's still a lot of things in my heart that I feel the Lord would like us to look at but I'd like to at the very outset today quickly go back over two principles one of headship uh that we've been looking at over the last several services on the role of the husband and the father and then just quickly revisit the context of the subject the house of the Lord in terms of a home so those are two things I'd like to review very quickly and then U I'll give you my title here just in a few moments and if you could just stay close to me um it's a close enough facility to where you everyone's within Arms Reach it seems but just stay with me as we go forward uh and focus as much as possible the fewer distractions and the less getting up and down the the I say this to the kids the quicker we'll get out of here and uh and so there's some incentive to stay in their seats and then my luck I'll preach longer than I ever have before and they'll like that didn't work but first Corinthians 11:3 says but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God and we can see that this verse here establishes order very very quickly and whether it be Christ man and the woman all are under headship that's definitely something we want to take from this the head of Christ is God Christ is the head of the man the man is the head of the woman everyone is under headship and as it says the head is uh a Christ of the church and of the man the woman those things and and we look at those that meaning of head it speaks of the Supreme the very word means the supreme or the chief uh The prominent and when you think of that the chief of the woman is the man and the chief of the man is Christ and maybe there's some people that really like that especially Chiefs and there's uh there's this emphasis of the minent one the powerful one the Supreme one and it it does allude to supremeness and chiefess and that's uh the god to Christ Christ to the man man to the woman so we see there's some order established there then Ephesians 5: 23 and 24 it says the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is Christ is the savior of the body so again we see uh just using these two scriptures to look at the image of Christ as the head of the church and now the man as the head of the woman and that parallel that Paul is drawing and saying the as the Christ is a savior and is a nourisher a and a an an adorer of the church and one that serves and washes and cleanses the man should be that to the woman and I'm saying by extension to his children to the family and so the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church Christ is the head of the church he's priest and King over his body he is a servant he is uh he is sacrificial and we see that example in the scripture so the man is to be a priest in the home he's to be the head of his home and those are two things we've covered in great detail so there's the man as the head as the chief as a supreme and the role that he has to his wife and to his children and it's like that of Christ and we catch that this is the this is the standard for uh headship as a man and then as uh this is kind of going back quite a ways earlier in the year the house of the Lord when we began this some of the subjects we looked at is how there's a three- room house or there's three different houses and we looked at you as a house your home as a house and also your church so there's ways that you could say well you are the house of God your family is the house of God or it's the household and this church is a house and we want to make all these houses homes those are some of the things that we were looking at and whether it be you your home your family or this church reflection of Christ and his body so Christ and his bride or that image of Christ is what we reflect and we are a type of in our families in our homes and as a church and we uh those very things about Christ were foreshadowed in the Tabernacle in the wilderness and the temple that those things spoke of Christ Christ being a three room house and Christ uh being the Fulfillment of all those sacrifices and all those images and I hope you can remember that that the house house of the Lord in the Old Testament was foreshadowing Jesus Christ so something in the way that those things were structured and built that spoke of Christ now that's my review portion how' I do in two minutes I don't think that's too bad if or maybe it was five minutes but I want to explore the subjects of Foundations and beginnings and as we look at um and now you have it uh there in the title as we've looking at the house of the Lord and we talk about foundations and Beginnings there's a lot of things you could begin to entertain in that but I want to draw from the image of the h a house and the house of the Lord and uh from in headship I want to look at those two things together and my title is the foundational principle of headship and hopefully kind of tie together some of these recent uh subjects on headship and the role of the man and so you could jot this down you could write this the foundational principle of headship maybe a longer title than normal but this is to me really captures what I'm trying to emphasize on if there's a foundational principle I want to look at it in terms of headship and I'm going to cover a lot of scripture so this in some of it review but in doing so I think you'll understand what I mean by this title what we're pointing to now if you could just look at our text again 1 Corinthians chapter 3 we'll start with verse 9 we'll go to verse 13 I believe it says for we are labors together with God you're God's husbandry you're God's Building now this is about you as an individual the statement you are his Vineyard that he's going to dress he's going to keep he's going to see that it's fruitful you're also his building that he's building up to a finish and so he says according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation Paul is this prophet in that first church age if you want to look at it that way Apostle he is laying the foundation and once the foundation is laid he says there's going to be those that build upon this foundation and so every man ought to take heed how he builds upon that Foundation we use the scripture in looking make your heart a home for Christ and make your uh make your house a home make this church a home for Christ we looked at all those different uh things using this scripture and even referred to how men are to be homebuilders and women are to be home makers and so this was a scripture that we've used and Paul says I've laid the foundation it speaks of the foundation of a building or a wall or a city and it has its roots in the beginnings of something I've laid the foundation or the first principles of something and that's uh that's what's meant I have laid the beginning I've laid the foundation of this for other foundation in verse 11 this is the foundation that Paul has laid for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ is the foundation that Paul laid I'm going to emphasize this maybe for the next half hour Jesus Christ is the foundation he is the beginning he is the first principle uh uh that is laid down and now he says for If any man build upon this Foundation of Christ and he says build gold silver precious stones he's saying that that work is going to be made manifest but then also if they build wood hay and stubble that's going to be tried it's going to be revealed by fire for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is and so the gold the silver the precious stones those are things that will survive the trial but wood hay and stubble will be burned up and it will not remain uh once it's examined and once it's been tried by fire now I want to say this as it kind of struck me yesterday as I was looking at this uh in great detail that if Christ is the foundation and he's perfect if the structure fails it's not because of the the foundation it's because of how a man built and that's what Paul is saying he's saying I've laid the foundation and Christ is the perfect foundation and so if something is failing or something is rickety or something's out of kilter it's not because the found Foundation it's because the the structure was built incorrectly proper Foundation but as it begin to grow and build thereupon the right kind of things weren't being added whether it be gold silver and precious stones maybe too much wood hay and stubble a and maybe you're not following the blueprint so the foundation is good but the way that we build upon it is weakening the intended structure but Christ is the foundation in Ephesians chapter 2: 19-22 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God you are his family you are the household of God his Dwelling Place you are his husbandry you are his building and are built upon the foundation so now you are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstones this is just an image now he says Christ is the foundation he's saying the apostles and Prophets are part of that Foundation which brother brandham teaches us that uh Moses was in Christ and Joseph was in Christ because Christ comes as the Fulfillment he even calls him a Capstone to the to that Jewish time period the Jewish Church ages and so we see that the apostles and Prophets are represented in Jesus Christ but Christ is called the Chief Cornerstone there's that Chief again this prominent one this Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fit framed together groweth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit I hope those words are plain English though they're written in that old English style that you are part of the habitation of God you are the dwelling place of God together we make the entire habitation of God through his Spirit we all together become the Holy Temple of the Lord so Christ is the foundation we are built upon the foundation of Christ Christ Christ is now described as the Chief Cornerstone and we are built on that built means to build upon or to build up and it means to finish the structure of which the foundation has already been laid so as we read this there's this constant increase in the knowledge of Christ there's this constant expression of Christ that's taking place as you grow up and as you build up so the foundation is there and then there's this continuing finish of the structure upon which the foundation uh which is built upon a foundation does that make sense that we we're built upon a foundation so it is the finishing of the structure that is built upon the foundation that is already laid and Christ is it says the Chief Cornerstone of the foundation in whom all the building so this is speaks of a foundation stone or the setting Stone and and it's used it's used just to help us to understand what Christ means and and what this Foundation means and to call it the Chief Cornerstone it's the first stone that's set in the construction of a foundation and you'll find that in masonry and in construction there's a lot of ceremony that's even given to the Cornerstone and a lot of things that relate to it not necessarily wanting to get into those things because I think the meaning is is fairly obvious and what it means to be the Cornerstone and once you have the foundation stone or the setting Stone if we could even maybe there's a little bit of a distraction in me referring during the ceremony this had significance in masonry especially back then because when they would use this foundation stone of the setting Stone it became the very reference point for everything else all other Stones were set in reference to the Cornerstone that had to go down first you couldn't just start in the middle and work your way to the Cornerstone you started with the beginning the the beginning was the Chief Cornerstone and then everything else in the foundation would have to be set according to that foundation stone therefore it it determines the position of the entire structure so if you don't have a Chief Cornerstone you're just guessing at the the position of the entire structure but using the Chief Cornerstone it would determine the position of the entire thing and with the Chief Cornerstone all the building fit fitly framed together grow with so all the building grows so from the foundation it's built up to a full structure so once you have the Cornerstone you're like Oh What a Beautiful Cornerstone and you're happy with the Cornerstone and you and you go on and you don't just get the foundation say Oh What a Beautiful Foundation it has the building growth so it's from Foundation to full structure so when we look at the house of the Lord It's from the beginning and the foundation to the finishing or the Perfection Perfection different elements but from that very beginning Christ is the Chief Cornerstone he's set as the reference point for everything else you get him wrong everything else is wrong everything else is a guess and so this is the the the the beginning is the foundation and the finishing is the perfecting now to substantiate my my emphasis this morning is on the foundation and Christ being the foundation is and in Zechariah chap 10:4 just a short verse but it speaks of Christ it says out of him and it's speaking of Judah we know the Messiah was going to come from Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah there's a lot of prophecies that speak to this King that would arise from Judah out of him Judah cometh came forth the corner out of him the nail out of him the battle bow out of him every oppressor together now as it's spoken out of him came forth the corner out of him the nail it's prophecy there's some historical application uh in the days of Zachariah but this this is prophecy of Jesus Christ out of him out of Judah will come forth the Cornerstone it says out of him the nail in Isaiah 22: 22- 24 says and the key of the House of David will lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut he shall shut and None Shall open we know this is speaking of Christ the Messiah and I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place this is this is an image of a building this is the image of a structure he's going to be a nail in a sure place and he shall be for glorious Throne to his father's house this is something thick something permanent and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house The Offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity from the vessels of Cups even to all the vessels of flaggin and so there's a a lot that's expressed in this and I had a much lengthier reading and I just cut it down to these few verses to see how that out of Judah will come this nail he's going to be the strength of the house he's going to be the thing that holds it together I'll fasten him as a nail in a sure place he's going to be for the glory of the Throne of the father's house we're going to hang upon him all the glory of the father's house so that it will not fail it will not fall and that's what Christ is he's this he's the one that's holding it all together he is the he is the Cornerstone and he's also looked at as the nail something that's fastening it all together so out of Judah will come the corner and that's the Corner Stone that foundation stone the setting Stone of a foundation or the beginning of a structure the beginning as it says here of the father's house or his father's house of the house of the Lord as I would like to say now in Isaiah chap 28:1 16 speaking again of Christ therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste so there's going to be a stability to those that believeth upon this Foundation I will lay in Zion now we could say Zion is the brightest brother says always I will lay in Zion for a foundation stone I'm going to lay a foundation stone a Cornerstone and it's going to be a tried Stone a precious stone a sure foundation so there's going to be a foundation that Foundation or that beginning this is going to be a beginning I will lay for a beginning a stone which is a tried Stone a COR press ious Cornerstone a sure foundation and who is that Jesus Christ is the beginning Christ is the first he is the sure Foundation I will lay in Zion for a foundation stone a tried Stone Christ was tried he was a precious stone he is a sure Foundation Jesus says in Matthew 16:18 he's speaking about who do men say that I am and Peter who do you say that I am Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he says Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter which is Stone and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it this rock is the revelation of Jesus Christ and that is the foundation upon which we are built and when he says Thou Art Peter and he's changing his name to Stone because the church is built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone so now Christ is the foundation the stone and then it's Stone upon stone that builds up the entire body that builds up the church Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock the revelation of Jesus Christ I I will build my church I'm not just building a foundation I'm building a building I'm not just tilling the ground I want a I want a Vineyard I I want a planting and this Christ is a foundation that is so sure he's a nail and a sure place he's going to be the glory of the Throne of his father's house the glory of the father's house everything shall hang on him it's going to be so sure that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it it's a sure Foundation it's unassailable it's permanent it's solid it's not shifting the Cornerstone I lay a a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone that's that foundation stone it had to be laid first brother Brandon when he's touching on this I've just been studying the way he approaches this Cornerstone this foundational Stone and he makes reference to how he had to be received first before they could go on he had to be accepted first other words God has these great plans for Israel but God's never going to fulfill those plans unless they receive the foundation stone if they don't receive the beginning they can't have them in the end or they can't have the finished product and so Jesus Christ must first be revealed or laid in order to build the church or even the individual so we we have to have a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to us in order for us to be built into the statue of a perfect man we have to have the beginning of faith in Jesus Christ he's the foundation Jesus Christ must first be revealed in order for Christ to be built in us he is this foundation stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation good man we're making awesome time you guys are going to get to Portillos before 2 o'clock in Psalms 118:22 and again as I mentioned there's a lot of lot of scripture here I want to look at this in detail the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner so this phrase the stone which the builders refused this is Jesus Christ in the beginning the stone is the tried Stone the precious Cornerstone the sure found found out of him come forth the corner this is the Chief Cornerstone as Paul said it this is the foundation that no one else can lay and which is late as Jesus Christ in notice it is refused that's interesting because that's what we're referring to him brother said he had to be accepted first or received first before they could go on but he's been rejected so if you reject the Cornerstone you can't build the building you got to find something else to build around you have to find something else to orient yourself to he's the true he's the tried he's the precious he's the one that comes and they refuse him now in Matthew chap 21: 42 43 and 44 Jesus saith unto them did you ever read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner and then he also repeats verse 23 this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes see have you read what the psalmist wrote and they wouldn't have necessarily said Psalms 118: 22 and 23 but this would have been something the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in her eyes and they' say okay all right we know what we're referring to therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof in other words I come to my own and my own is receiving me not I am the stone and you're rejecting me you were called to be a kingdom of priests you were called to build up the name of God this was your calling so you're to receive me as the foundational Stone upon which the kingdom of God was going to be built that everything's been foreshadowing to this moment but now you're going You're rejecting me and because you're rejected me the kingdom is going to be taken from you and given to a gentile bride and then he says and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken but upon whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder quite quite an image but if you could if I'm careful how I point to this if you could think about this whoever this Stone whoever falls on this stone is going to be broken and whomever this Stone Falls on it'll grind him to powder so even in that statement it shows something foundational but then something coming now Christ here identifies himself as the rejected foundation stone very clearly says you know Psalms 18:22 and 23 you're rejecting me this word is going to go this kingdom is going to be given to somebody else a and this Stone me if you fall on you'll be broken and it'll grind to powder him that it falls upon in Acts 4: 8-12 this is where I think some of the reading I just want to read it I think it's obvious what's being mentioned but I want you to see the repetition these principles of Jesus Christ being the foundation stone then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the import imp impotent Man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all of the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you oh quite a quite a statement you remember Jesus Christ the one you crucified the one you rejected it's by that name one whom God raised from the dead that this man this impotent man is made whole and he says this very plainly this is the stone which was said at not of you Builders which is become the head of the corner so he's he's quoting Psalms 18:22 and quoting Jesus Christ who said that he was that stone this is the stone which was said at not by the by you build ERS you've rejected them he says which has become the head of the corner and then he says neither is their salvation and any other for there's none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Christ is the rejected Cornerstone and he's foundational and it says in this beautiful image of him being the Cornerstone but it says there's not salvation in any other name under Heaven except that name Jesus Christ so if there's the banner of Heaven you have to have this basement this Foundation uh uh this footer this beginning of Jesus Christ and if he's rejected there's no salvation because he's the beginning he's that trid stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation this is Jesus Christ the stone which was set at not by the Jews now Peter again visits this in his first epistle 1 Peter chapter 2: 5 to10 says ye also as as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house again this is looking at the very things as Paul said that you are a household of God you are the building of God uh I've laid a foundation take heat how you build thereup but we're all part of the temple of God being built up so Peter's language is perfectly in line with Paul's teaching you are Lively Stone so you are part of God's habitation you're part of his building a holy priesthood so now not only are you the house but you're the priesthood that offers spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ in the house of the Lord so you're all these types are being fulfilled in this beautiful relationship that we have through our Union with Christ where all wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious now this is Isaiah 28 and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded so this is he that believeth shall not make haste he's not going to be ashamed he's not going to be confounded he's not going to be disappointed so he that believeth in this elect precious Cornerstone Chief Cornerstone unto you therefore which believe he is precious that's what he is right to us who believe because we shall not make case we will not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he's precious and I want I'm transitioning a little bit now I'm going a little bit further to those who who see him and he's been foundation's been laid and therefore you have having accepted him you can go on he's precious but then the language changes but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the Builder disallowed so he is there's the Disobedience that reject him the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner now there's there's a lot that was just said there but to you he's the precious Foundation but then this is the stone which the builders rejected to the disobedient they've rejected him he's not precious he's not their orientation he's not determining their bounds and their and the the the the remaining structure they have he he hasn't determined he's not a fixed point that they determine them judge themselves by they're disobedient now having been rejected verse 8 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient wherein to also they were appointed so I'm thank God we have a different appointed of election to receive the chief Cornerstone but to the disobedient now he's still a stone but it's a stone of stumbling he's still a rock but it's a rock of offense and what do they stumble at the word and they're they're appointed to this but ye are a chosen generation and this phrase I hope this phrase just begins to mean more to you in its paradoxical structure a royal priesthood in the Old Testament there was such a division between the throne and the temp the altar uh a king and the priest but yet through Christ we are made Kings and Priests in order to be a royal priesthood we're not forbidden as royalty to enter into the most holy place and offer up a spiritual sacrifices we can present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice and it's acceptable to God you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but now but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy with beautiful prophecies about the body of Christ this Gentile bride it's not the house of Israel that has rejected Christ but it's the elect of God who have received him it's the very ones that Jesus said I will take the kingdom of God and give it to a nation that's going to bring forth fruits thereof going to show forth the Praises of him who called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light we have obtained Mercy to us he is precious amen think of that to to some a stone of stumbling but a stepping stone to others a rock of offense to others a building block to someone else the very thing that causes some to stumble becomes the very thing that causes someone to be to stand firm the very thing that is an offense is the very thing that somebody else is being built up by these are some of the scriptures that are being referred to I realize maybe I out have trunc this a little bit but in Isaiah veres 8:14 he shall be for a sanctuary that's what he is to us but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the house of houses of Israel for a Jin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem he's a sanctuary to some a snare to others it's a safe place to to some a a rock in which we hide but a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to others this is what Peter's pointing back to is Isaiah 8 and then Paul picks it up in Romans 9:33 as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of off fence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed it's it's it's interesting language I'm going to put a stumbling Stone in an offensive Rock it's going to bring it right out into Le oysa and it's going to be offensive and it's going to stumble but whosoever believes on him is not going to be confounded not going to be disappointed doesn't have to make haste they can stand secure so Christ is offensive he is a stumbling Stone he is a rock of offense he has always been and will always will be this is what he is in the Cornerstone this is the very thing that they reject now this is I I I want to I guess I don't really need to hide anything but I want to be careful that I don't open up the door a door prematurely but if you reject a stone in the corner you're not going to use it's a a stone rejected the corner is is not deemed worthy maybe you'll find another place for it use it somewhere else you're going to give some thought to that Cornerstone and so it being rejected as a Cornerstone the phrase is just even more outstanding in Psalms 18:22 the stone which the builders refused who is that Christ the psalm says is become The Headstone of the corner now when we read that we think the the stone that's refused has become the Cornerstone and that's true they rejected him but he began to lay another Foundation which was his church wasn't going to be Israel it's going to be his body it's going to be a bride but it says is become The Headstone of the corner it means The Headstone or the Capstone now there is a lot of things that we could bring out in quotations from the message of the hour a lot of teaching I hope you're able to uh that you're listening to the word of God you've studied it I know you all have been well taught in your different assemblies and as God has brought us together here we have the benefit of the labor of Ministries for decades in your lives in your own personal studies so I realize we're working with good material but as it says the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner this is prophecy and this verse contains two entirely different dispensations the foundation stone is rejected and the foundation stone has become the Capstone and I and I want you to see this want do this very quickly how that you could have within one sentence uh two different dispensations separated by hundreds of thousands of years in Isaiah chapter 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon a shoulder so we see that in Christ he came he was a child he was a son but this fullness of the government being upon his shoulder this is something that happens later so when you have this colon and this is a separation it's a space between one fulfillment and another fulfillment Isaiah chapter 61:2 is he Jesus stood up in the temple and began to open up where it was written I come to bind up the Brokenhearted and I've sent to do these things says to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and he says he closed the book and he stopped comma and this is a gap and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn so here's uh 2,000 year comma and So within the same sentence you have one fulfillment but then and and it's true it's Christ it's one thing but then he comes later and fulfills another part so in Psalms 118 Verse 22 the foundation has been refused but the very one that was refused to the foundation will become the head stone to the Cornerstone he will become the head of the corner or the top Stone not only bonding the walls together but completing the building and so the one that they rejected in the beginning would never be considered as the finishing Stone so the statement is this the one that you refuse to even use as a Cornerstone is the one that's going to be the actual capping and finishing Stone of the entire thing Christ is the foundational Stone he is the one that sets everything in its bounds he's the one that everything is fixed in relation to he's the one that determines the position of the entire structure he is the beginning but he's also going to be the finishing he is the Chief Cornerstone and he is to become the Capstone Zachariah 4: 6 7 8 and 9 then he answered and spake unto me saying these are the the scriptures that we point to in this saying this is the word of the Lord UND deseral saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts the one that's going to build back up the temple build up the walls lay the foundation again who art thou oh great Mountain before zerel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with he shouting is crying Grace Grace Uno it this shows a Capstone coming headstone verse n the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house now in this foundation and whether we want to talk about the foundation of the word the foundation of Faith the foundation of Jesus Christ there's a foundation that's laid his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you he shall bring forth The Headstone is his hand shall also finish it those two things connected together to finish it means to complete to accomplish so The Headstone is the finishing it is the capping Stone it's what caps it off so Christ is the beginning Stone but Christ is the finishing Stone you see what's happening here he's the Cornerstone he's the foundation but he's also the head that comes in the end The Headstone Revelations 18 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayeth the Lord this is what he the Lord which is the which was which is and is to come the almighty so the foundation stone that was rejected if it's rejected as a foundation stone maybe you'll use it somewhere else but if it wasn't fit to be a Cornerstone it's not fit to be a Capstone and it's saying the very one you rejected to be a Cornerstone is the perfecting of it all he is the Capstone so Christ is the Chief Cornerstone he's the base the basis the most critical to the subsequent building and therefore to the building itself but he's also the Capstone the final piece that perfects it and holds it all together in Colossians chap 1: 17 and 18 and he is before all things he's the foundation and by him all things consist I want to come back to that and he is the head of the body in the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence he is before in other words he's the beginning he's the foundation and he is the from the beginning notice he's from the beginning and he's the head he is before all things but by him all things consist that all things consist means by him all things are held together beh by him all things are united or banded together by him everything becomes capped and perfected finished complete amen words there must be there must come one who becomes that Keystone as it were there there must be something that comes that's going to hold it all together you have the right kind of foundation and Paul says be careful how you build because how you build that that part may fail so there's a foundation that comes there's a building that comes he says now kind of like the last thing that secures it and seals it and makes it sure is the Capstone he is the one before all things and he's the one that's going to have preeminence in all things now at this point at this stage what time is I don't have a clock there it is I got it right in front of me wake up your neighbor your spouse I know it's getting a little hot I don't know if it needs to be cold whatever it needs to be but I'm almost done and I'd really hate for you guys to miss this part you've missed the first part some of you but don't miss this part please do not miss this part and if this part doesn't make sense you'll have to get the tapes Christ is the Chief Cornerstone Christ is the Capstone this is the foundational principle of headship Jesus Christ was the first he is the foundation and the campstone the head is the foundation first so some of you when I said the foundational principle of headship might have thought it's not how you spell it but I meant it this way the foundational principle of headship as an adjective it's the main the chief the dominant the greatest the most important the principal theme or the principle of the flock the way the scripture the chief The prominent the principal H uh of something as an adjective but then as a noun it's the chief man the leading representative the one who takes the lead so the foundational principle of headship is the one who is Chief the greatest the most important the the principles that leading representative the one who takes the lead Christ is the foundational principle of headship the one who takes the lead he was the captain of our Salvation the one that takes the lead in something remember how brother Brown talked about the Jeffersonville fire department squirt a little there squirt a little there yeah and then the captain from Louisville showed up and he said come on boys and he led the charge that's what a captain does he takes the lead in something amen and in John 13: 15 to 17 after Christ had humbled himself and knelt before his disciples and washed their feet and we could see in Peter's reaction saying whoa you're the master you're the teacher we should be washing your feet and Peter wants to refuse uh this service but he says I have given you an example that you should do as I've done to you he's the master he's the teacher he's the head he's the Chief and he's kneeling debasing himself dering putting on a a towel and washing their feet as an example so he says verily verily i s to you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him and if you know these things happy are you if you do them I'm teaching you I'm demonstrating to you humility I'm demonstrating to you service I'm demonstrating to you as the master how I can get beneath you and serve you and wash your feet and I've given you example that you also o should do so being the principal Foundation you understand the principle of the foundation he was able to become the head of the church you following this I'm I'm just just a few more moments here and we're going to be done that's why I woke you up I didn't want you to miss the dismissal song and John 10: 14 and 15 he says I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of Mind of mine as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and I laay down my life for the Sheep am if you could please just focus with me a few more moments this is some of the clo this is this is my I've got one thing I want to use at the very end about a Shepherd but right now I've built this this thought to this point this foundational principle of headship he says I'm the Good Shepherd Christ could be the Good Shepherd and I know we've mentioned this before but I want to mention this context with this kind of foundation he could be a good shepherd because he was first first he became a lamb he says I I am a good shepherd and I laid down my life for the Sheep yes the Bible says that the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book but the lion that conquered and prevailed was first the lamb that had been slain so there's there's this image of Christ The Lion but he's a lion after he had become a lamb he is Christ the Good Shepherd but he first lays down his life for his sheep so he teaches the foundational principle of headship he demonstrates himself to be the foundational principle of headship him being the principal him being the chief but he's also given us a principle this is another word you might have thought that I should have spelled at this way the foundational principle that's the origin the source of the beginning or that rule of conduct that basic assumption this is a fundamental truth upon which everything else is established so when we talk about building the house of the Lord you as an individual or your family or your house becoming a home or this church there's got to be a basic principle a fundamental truth upon which the home is established we must have that amen we have to have some as we talked about the family you know the wisdom of a the instructions the Commandment of a father well what is it there has to be some foundational element to these things something that serves as a Bedrock for shaping values in the character of the home so for us if I'm speaking to heads and I could speak to all of us before we can be a lion we must first be a lamb and to be the head you have to learn to be the floor if you're ever going to be the head you have to first be the floor to be to be the Principal to be the chief to be the great one to be the dominant one to be the head of the home you have to first be the Bedrock because that's how Christ came he he he didn't come as a head first he came as a foundation he came meek and lowly came humble he he he came in a certain way and because he's the foundation he could become the head before this is what I'm saying in this foundational principle of headship to be the head you must first become the foundation to be the head the ruler the most prent you have to first become the basis amen does I hope you see the picture in this the the the Cornerstone that was laid in the beginning becomes the Capstone but it's not aead and a Capstone first it's a beginning point it's the solidifying force it's the thing that orients and gives position the entire thing you can't be out of your place as a foundation you can't be out of your place as a Ro and try to impose yourself as a head you first have to be a foundation before you can ever be ahead am Revelations 3:12 he that overcometh I make a pillar in the temple of my God he begins to talk about the name of my God which is Jesus Christ the city of my God the New Jerusalem this is the bride she's in this she's in this picture and you are to be a pillar in the temple to be a pillar in the temple you become part of the foundation a pillar in the house of the Lord you can look at those three rooms those three houses this the Temple of my God and its application I to him that overcometh I will make a pillar I want I'm using this just to point back to what a what it means to be a c a Cornerstone what it means to be a foundation brother Bram writes this in chapter 8 of the church age book now he's not only giv crowns but he says that these and the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was Destroy This Temple and I'll raise it up it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us now he's going to make the Overcomer a pillar in the temple but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the super structure amen if we are to be pillars in the house of God if we're to be pillars in our in our home life as husbands and and fathers if we're to be a pillar we have to be part of the foundation that holds up that holds up the rest of the structure so the first Principle as a as a that principle with the IPL that first principle of headship is we must be a sure Foundation we can think of headship in a certain way the chief the Supreme The prominent one the ruler the leader and that's the principle one but we have to first become that principle of the foundation we have to be a support we have to be a strength we have to be one that's a lifter the entire structure is depending on us I guess listen I this is I I have some scriptures here I want to read and I'll say this before I get there because i' been holding off on this part it it had some context and the man of the home and the priest in the Home and these other places but there's this idea of headship where it kind of gets real topheavy right you have this great one at the top and he's like well I'm so unstable because you sheep you guys are worthless you guys are horrible you guys are awful you need to hold me up what are you doing you need to hold me up and there's this idea that the head is lifted up by the body and and and and if there's any weakness in the head it's your fault and if the head does this it's because you did this and you made me do it and the whole idea it becomes topheavy because it's all about the head and and we don't realize that that whole system is built upon the fact that you're not the head unless you're the foundation and therefore the foundation is ones that's lifting up the super structure and you've got to be a good foundation and this is a challenge to us as men if there's some weakness somewhere in the family maybe it's not because everyone else is out of their place maybe you're trying trying to be a head when you need to be a flooor maybe you're trying to be a Capstone when you need to be a foundation and the instability is where you're trying to position yourself and you've got to get in position first and become stable amen you'll never be able to lead running around that's right says he that Shall Believe will not make haste and you can't you can't you can't try to lead out in front I'm going to SC the blaz of TR just to go you got to become stable now in Zechariah 13:7 this will kind of tie into what I was just saying about this everything's on the head and well I'm not going to argue it all goes to Christ and it all goes to him and we're going to give him our best and we're going to grow into the him which is the head but where do you start you start in him he's not asking you to grow into the head which is Christ and not be in you not be beneath you building you up planting you making you secure we we know we're going to make it to the top because he's got us and he's in us working through us to get us to the top he's not at the top lording over saying come on man get up here he's behind you saying you got this I'm going to get you there you're going to make it to the top oh you're going to be perfect you're going to be complete ah the Lord will do this and he's holding you up lifting you and oh no I'm afraid no I got you don't don't worry don't worry this is going to we're going to make this and Zechariah 13:7 awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow sayith the Lord of hosts Smite the shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn my hand upon the little ones God so supernaturally confirmed this to me I that I just I can say it with confidence no one that's going to hit home in some way maybe uniquely for everyone else but as I close this Smite the head the body d he says Smite the shepherd the Sheep scatter and now we say oh that that we look at that and you say oh W the shepherd now the shepherd but notice how Christ uses this Matthew 26:31 then said Jesus said unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad the shepherd is he to whose care and control others have committed themselves the sheep have committed themselves to the care of the shepherd and being under the care of the shepherd there there's this vulnerability but remember Christ just wasn't a Shepherd lording over the flock he was a servant to it and he said that he would give himself up for the Sheep sake not that they would be scattered though they would be offended and though they would be fearful he was going to lay his life down he was going to be smitten and being smitten they were going to scatter and as Christ is crucified and later on in this same chapter it gives us some great detail it says all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled so all the disciples fleed now I'm wanting to use Christ as the shepherd because in him we see a Good Shepherd he's a chief Shepherd because he was a lamb he's the Good Shepherd because he was sheep something that we should never lose sight of when it comes to leadership if you're going to be a good leader you should have been a good follower if you're ever going to be a head you have to first learn to be the feet there's a way that we have to look at this in a way that is a complete picture so Christ was their leader he was the head he was the shepherd but he first became their foundation and when Christ was smitten their Foundation was shaken their protection their support the one that was serving them the one that was leading them the one that was guiding them so when we say Smite the shepherd this isn't some kind of Mantra uh uh to be used to be protective of the head oh Smite the shepherd this is an attack on the shepherd oh the they're trying to attack the pastor trying to attack the Shepherd no no no no no no the goal is to scatter the Sheep the goal is to get to you to get to the body and so it's not a manster to be protective of the top it's a reminder to us that that that this is a reminder of just how important our headship is to those that we're leading and this is this is this is a mantra to the heads and to the heads of households and the heads of the family to the heads of the church that if the shepherd are smitten he's the one that's the foundation he should be the protector he should be the lifter he should be the one that's looking out after him and so if you forsake your duties as a foundation they're going to scatter just the same Jeremiah says wo and you who scattered the flock so there's a work there's a sacrifice to be done by the founding principle the foundational principle of headship is that principle has got to be in the foundation I know it's a little bit of a word play and some of you probably thought I got it wrong in the beginning but you've got to be the founding principle if you're going to be if there's ever going to be any headship if you're ever going to be at the top you got to start at the very bottom and say this is where it begins and there's work to be done amen a lot of work to be done in the beginning and God may be having some of us work back a little and come back to the foundation to the Bedrock let's stand
