[0:01] turn to second corinthians chapter one
[0:03] i'd like to read verses 1 to 11
[0:08] and mention that
[0:10] uh what we're reading here i want to
[0:11] come back to
[0:13] and if you could maybe take notice as we
[0:16] read today that there's a lot of um
[0:20] acting together of the first and second
[0:22] corinthians a lot of
[0:24] principles
[0:25] that paul expresses to the corinthian
[0:27] church
[0:28] and we're going to be touching on i want
[0:30] you kind of see this theme and some
[0:31] continuity in that second corinthians
[0:34] chapter 1
[0:35] verses 1 to 11
[0:37] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[0:39] will of god and timothy our brother
[0:42] under the church of god who is at
[0:43] corinth with all the saints which are
[0:46] in all acaiah grace be to you and peace
[0:49] from god our father and from the lord
[0:51] jesus christ
[0:53] blessed be god even the father of our
[0:54] lord jesus christ the father of mercies
[0:56] and the god of all comfort i just love
[0:59] that phrase the god of all comforter
[1:01] and then who comfort us in all our
[1:03] tribulation that we may be able to
[1:05] comfort them which are in any trouble by
[1:08] the comfort where we we ourselves are
[1:10] comforted of god so notice that god the
[1:12] god of all comfort comforts us but then
[1:14] we are a source of comfort for others
[1:17] for as the sufferings of christ abound
[1:19] in us so our consolation also aboundeth
[1:21] by christ and whether we be afflicted it
[1:23] is for your consolation and salvation
[1:25] which is effectual in the enduring of
[1:27] the same sufferings which we also
[1:29] suffered or whatever we be comforted it
[1:31] is for your consolation and salvation
[1:33] and our hope of you is steadfast by the
[1:36] law minister on steadfast faith here's
[1:38] the steadfastness
[1:40] that bring that steadfast faith bringing
[1:42] a steadfast hope knowing that as you're
[1:44] partakers of the suffering so shall you
[1:46] be also of the consolation this is where
[1:49] i'd like to focus on he says for we
[1:51] would not brethren have you ignorant of
[1:53] our trouble which came to us in asia
[1:55] from his other writings
[1:57] is speaking of
[1:58] some
[1:59] difficulty he had in lystra where he was
[2:02] facing death as he explicitly
[2:05] lays it out here that we were pressed
[2:06] out of measure of strength in so much
[2:08] that we despaired even of life but we
[2:11] had the sentence of death on ourselves
[2:14] that we should not trust in ourselves
[2:15] but in god which raiseth the dead
[2:18] who delivered us from so great at death
[2:20] and doth deliver in whom we trust that
[2:22] he will yet deliver us
[2:25] ye also helping together by prayer force
[2:27] that for the gift bestowed upon us by
[2:29] the means of many persons thanks may be
[2:31] given by many on our behalf
[2:34] god bless you you can be seated
[2:36] continue on the subject this is part
[2:38] nine of barriers and boundaries we've
[2:41] started a
[2:42] sub-subject on
[2:45] love has limits
[2:47] and i know it is kind of maybe a little
[2:49] bit of a catchy
[2:50] uh
[2:51] phrase or title to say love has limits
[2:54] because i think there is a little bit of
[2:55] uh
[2:57] even in the nominal world today there's
[2:59] uh kind of a message and agenda that
[3:01] love has no limits and it's kind of used
[3:03] to express the idea that love can exist
[3:06] in many different expressions and
[3:08] relationships and many different forms
[3:10] and that we should not uh redefine love
[3:12] to exclude certain affinities affections
[3:15] lust or desires from the definition of
[3:18] love and so i'm not this isn't a counter
[3:20] attack against
[3:21] uh those yard signs but it is
[3:24] uh more looking to the love of god and
[3:27] how god's love is expressed to us and
[3:30] it's kind of when you think about
[3:32] barriers and boundaries it's we've
[3:34] mentioned this before that we're trying
[3:36] to
[3:37] express things in a way that you can
[3:39] better understand your relationship to
[3:40] god and then there's kind of we can
[3:42] extrapolate from that principles to help
[3:44] our relationships with each other
[3:46] but when we say love has limits we're
[3:48] explicitly saying that it has boundaries
[3:51] in that
[3:52] it is defined a certain way so that it
[3:54] expresses itself in a very specific
[3:57] manner
[3:58] that uh
[3:59] when that love is identifiable and that
[4:02] there's things that we can say is are
[4:04] not love or not expressive of love
[4:07] and so there's a framework within it
[4:08] within the it acts like it's going to
[4:10] act in a certain way it's going to look
[4:12] a certain way has parameters that it
[4:14] moves within and it's also it provokes
[4:17] as the bible says provoke one another
[4:19] unto love and to good works there's a
[4:21] way that when it's provoked
[4:23] it's when love is expressed it provokes
[4:25] something and brother brown talks about
[4:27] and ministers at a number of occasions
[4:29] on divine love projected when love
[4:31] projects and so there's a way that it
[4:33] projects and in those sermons
[4:35] he's identifying how that when that love
[4:38] went forth it brought something out the
[4:40] object of that was responded back and
[4:43] came back
[4:44] and so we are called and you can find
[4:46] this
[4:47] in the scripture
[4:49] that we are to project divine love that
[4:51] we're called to project it ourselves
[4:53] that's what christ did is he projected
[4:54] love and it's not in the same sense that
[4:57] we have to love everybody in the uh the
[5:00] worldly way in which they try to
[5:02] characterize christian love or love but
[5:04] we're to project the love of god and
[5:06] that's what christ did so love has a
[5:07] certain way that it acts and when love
[5:09] is acting as a certain thing that it
[5:11] ought to provoke
[5:12] and we were looking in first corinthians
[5:15] chapter 13 and i've just provided verses
[5:17] four to eight here
[5:19] so that you could look at this and this
[5:20] is the way that we broke it out how that
[5:22] what love is it suffers long so love is
[5:25] patient and love is kind
[5:27] and what it does it rejoices in truth it
[5:30] bears all things believes all things
[5:32] hope it their trust all things and
[5:34] endures all things these are the
[5:36] characteristics of charity divine love
[5:38] agape love and then what love isn't it
[5:41] is not puffed up it's not arrogant has
[5:44] an inflated erroneous view of itself
[5:46] it's not easily provoked means it's not
[5:48] easily irritated or angered
[5:51] and then what love doesn't it does not
[5:53] envy it does not vaunt itself does not
[5:55] behave indecently does not seek her own
[5:58] does not think evil does not rejoice in
[6:01] iniquity and charity does not fail
[6:03] charity never faileth and it loops us
[6:06] back in
[6:07] to how charity suffers long it kind of
[6:09] creates this picture that rounds out and
[6:11] i've used even that that
[6:14] symbol of eternity even when i was
[6:15] thinking how love have limits and you
[6:17] think about eternity how it's expressed
[6:19] that it rounds out and cuts out certain
[6:22] things this is what love is and
[6:24] everything else exists on the outside of
[6:26] that
[6:27] and on the subject of love it's so vast
[6:31] that you could you could start with love
[6:32] part one and we could preach about love
[6:34] until the body change
[6:36] he's well how in the world would you
[6:38] pull that off the bible says god is love
[6:40] right god is his word so you can just
[6:42] from that just like we're preaching
[6:43] jesus christ uh part 1 billion or
[6:46] whatever it might be in terms of all the
[6:48] sermons that have ever been preached
[6:49] we're always preaching jesus christ and
[6:51] none other that's who we preach and at
[6:53] first john 4 8 he that loveth not
[6:55] knoweth not god for god is love
[6:59] so there's if god has bound himself if
[7:01] god has things he cannot do and god is
[7:04] not man that he should lie and there's
[7:05] certain things that god has expressed
[7:07] himself in
[7:09] and god is loved and that that's just a
[7:11] very simple way for you to begin to
[7:12] think about what's in my heart when i
[7:15] say that love has limits it's not that
[7:17] we are strictly defining it as carnal
[7:19] people to fit a paradigm that meets our
[7:22] needs but it's to begin to think more
[7:24] directly and specifically about god's
[7:26] love towards us and how that ought to be
[7:28] projected from us so that it can be
[7:30] effective
[7:32] and i want to
[7:33] mention this briefly and i went back
[7:36] last night and just took out um
[7:38] all the scriptures and
[7:40] quotes that i had on this subject to say
[7:42] for another time and so i want to
[7:44] mention it now and hopefully we'll
[7:46] repeat these things in the near future
[7:48] but i want to speak for a moment just on
[7:49] the sovereignty of god
[7:51] because when we talk about love and how
[7:53] it's expressed and we begin to ponder
[7:56] the the uh the attributes and
[7:58] characteristics of love and what it is
[8:00] and what it isn't then there's a way
[8:01] that we could kind of make assumptions
[8:03] about it and be like oh well then this
[8:05] is the template this is the figure of
[8:07] love this is how love acts and we try to
[8:09] impose that on god himself and we when
[8:12] we when we do that we've missed
[8:14] something somewhere if it doesn't fit
[8:17] if god's not fitting the image if his
[8:19] actions and his words aren't fitting the
[8:21] image that we have of love then we don't
[8:23] try to change god to fit our image we've
[8:25] got to change
[8:26] what we what we see and
[8:28] how what we understand about love
[8:30] and so on the sovereignty of god we
[8:31] cannot force an image of love or
[8:33] kindness or decency and these things
[8:36] upon god that would make him evil
[8:38] or that make him act contrary to the
[8:41] nature of love because god is love
[8:44] and his providence and when we talk
[8:46] about his providence his purpose
[8:48] and his uh what he produces his purpose
[8:51] and that even his product is far beyond
[8:53] our understanding his ways are higher
[8:55] his thoughts are higher it's beyond
[8:57] ourselves it's beyond our comprehension
[9:00] and to us what might appear to be cruel
[9:02] uh uh unfair even just indifferent
[9:06] cannot be so with god's word
[9:08] if it seems cruel and indifferent if it
[9:10] seems unjust uh that you cannot
[9:13] associate those terms in their truth and
[9:16] in their purity to god's actions because
[9:18] the bible teaches us that no wickedness
[9:20] or no evil is attributed attributable to
[9:23] god
[9:24] you cannot attach evil mode to evil to
[9:27] his motives you cannot attach wickedness
[9:29] to his objective
[9:31] and as we we remind you quite often we
[9:33] cannot take our sense of decency and
[9:36] fairness and equity and justice
[9:38] and then expect god to abide by that
[9:41] just look at mankind and i'd love to
[9:43] spend more time on justice and on this
[9:44] subject of the sovereignty of god
[9:46] but just think of all the ways that we
[9:48] have as humans have tried to come up
[9:50] with a way to measure fairness
[9:54] right in a criminal justice system we
[9:55] have a jury of peers and in a
[9:58] civil justice system you have a judge
[10:00] and a trier of fact and even a jury in
[10:02] those situations as well and even in
[10:04] economics what's a fair price
[10:07] right if you're a seller a high one's
[10:09] fair
[10:10] if you're a buyer a low one's fair so
[10:12] they leave it to market dynamics to
[10:14] produce a medium that would be a fair
[10:17] market value is what they call it and
[10:18] these are just all the efforts of man to
[10:20] determine what's fair but when it comes
[10:22] to god whatever he says is truth and
[10:24] whatever he does is just
[10:26] because god is right he is good all the
[10:29] time and this is this so we can't just
[10:31] take god's actions like oh well that
[10:33] doesn't fit this and that doesn't fit
[10:34] that but what you want to do is have an
[10:37] understanding of the word of god and the
[10:39] knowledge of jesus christ and then know
[10:41] that god is going to act in harmony with
[10:43] his word and if something doesn't seem
[10:45] to act then maybe you're not looking at
[10:47] god
[10:48] what you've attributed to god maybe
[10:50] that's not god or maybe what you have
[10:52] taken as an assumption of what the
[10:53] nature and character of the word is
[10:55] maybe it's not right because it's not
[10:57] fitting what god does who god is and as
[11:00] the bible says that charity does not
[11:02] behave indecently unseemly as the word
[11:05] that's translated in the king james
[11:06] version
[11:07] it means it does not act in a way that's
[11:09] unfitting or inappropriate
[11:12] and
[11:12] i feel like i'm wanting to express
[11:14] something
[11:15] now to moderate uh kind of the way that
[11:17] we defined it on sunday
[11:19] don't get nervous i'm not going to
[11:20] retract anything uh necessarily but i
[11:23] want to uh kind of
[11:25] be a little bit more precise in my
[11:27] language because it means it's not it
[11:29] does not behave in a way that's
[11:31] unfitting or inappropriate it does not
[11:33] behave dishonorably
[11:34] i think we talked about it doesn't it's
[11:36] not disrespectful and i use the phrase
[11:39] uh intentionally uh
[11:42] involuntarily offensive
[11:44] and as i was studying this week i felt
[11:46] that that word offense or offended
[11:48] offended or offensive
[11:51] takes on a little bit broader meaning in
[11:52] society today and maybe the way that we
[11:54] use it and we must realize that jesus
[11:56] christ is offensive
[11:59] the word is offensive and and that we
[12:01] ought not to take too much issue with
[12:03] what is offensive
[12:05] and just realize that everyone has a
[12:06] right to offend and you have a right to
[12:08] be offended
[12:09] and so it's not that love is not
[12:11] offensive
[12:12] uh but it is not intentionally hurtful
[12:16] and it's not doing it for the purpose of
[12:17] spite and for the purpose of disrespect
[12:20] and saying because people do that all
[12:21] the time they take the word of god they
[12:22] take the message of the hour and they
[12:24] use it
[12:25] to cause harm they do it intentionally
[12:28] to be offensive when the word is
[12:30] offensive and it's in just its purity
[12:32] you don't need to defile it to make it
[12:34] offensive
[12:36] just keep it pure and it'll offend on
[12:38] its own so it's in that sense that it's
[12:40] not disrespectful or inappropriate or
[12:42] unfitting so if it's appropriate it can
[12:44] still be offensive but we're talking
[12:46] more of hurts
[12:47] that intend harm or that are meant to
[12:50] afflict
[12:51] and so we looked at that in the sense of
[12:52] what's appropriate it said love renders
[12:54] what is due
[12:56] so it is it does what is appropriate and
[12:58] what is just
[13:00] and what is righteous is not always what
[13:02] is nice
[13:04] right
[13:05] what it what is what is uh comports with
[13:07] the nature of god is not always what we
[13:09] think is uh cordial or kind
[13:13] and so love is proper love is decent is
[13:16] what the scripture is saying but not
[13:18] necessarily inoffensive
[13:20] if it's proper and decent if it's
[13:22] appropriate it means it's in harmony
[13:24] with the word of god the nature of god
[13:25] the word of god that's what it means and
[13:27] so if the word is offensive then
[13:29] offenses must be
[13:31] brother ron peterson shares what to me
[13:33] is one of the one of the funnier stories
[13:34] you'll hear about witnessing
[13:36] and he said when they were first serving
[13:38] the lord and he
[13:39] i was sharing with they were out on the
[13:41] beach and they found a hippie with long
[13:42] hair and i believe it was brother ron
[13:44] who might have challenged him and said
[13:45] you know don't you know the bible
[13:47] teaches that it's a shame for a man to
[13:49] have long hair and the guy just said so
[13:51] i'm ashamed
[13:53] you know it's like where do we go from
[13:54] there
[13:55] and so we don't necessarily we're not
[13:57] just we don't want to just shame people
[13:59] we don't want to just provoke these
[14:00] feelings of condemnation and guilt but
[14:02] the word can
[14:04] produce those kind of results and those
[14:07] kind of feelings but as long as it's the
[14:09] word you've got to leave the word is
[14:10] what does the cutting it's what does the
[14:12] uh does the work and does the tearing
[14:15] down and building up we don't need to
[14:16] try to do it ourselves
[14:18] and so god is righteous in his conduct
[14:21] they're just wanting to just get this
[14:22] idea of the sovereignty of god
[14:24] and it's never evil though it might be
[14:27] offensive
[14:28] so if there's things that transpire in
[14:30] your life or you see things happen in
[14:32] the lives of others we can't begin to
[14:34] try to figure out god's love because
[14:36] it's not always going to fit our figure
[14:38] of love
[14:39] and we have to realize that if it's god
[14:42] then it has a purpose if it's god then
[14:44] he has an objective and you cannot
[14:45] attach any evil product or any evil
[14:48] motive to that
[14:51] and so there's that's just a little
[14:53] snippet on the sovereignty of god that i
[14:55] want to be a part of
[14:57] this so now love has limits
[15:00] and as we've used this idea of the
[15:02] sovereignty of god it doesn't always act
[15:04] the way that we think it should it does
[15:05] not always look in the way that we think
[15:07] it should look and we ended with this
[15:09] and we're just picking up with this um
[15:12] this morning
[15:13] love is not does not manipulate
[15:17] and
[15:18] and
[15:19] is not manipulated
[15:21] so if if you can be manipulated that
[15:24] it's not love that's going to be
[15:25] manipulated
[15:26] if you are manipulative that's not
[15:28] really love that's acting i know that's
[15:30] maybe just food for thought and we could
[15:32] have a breakout session and just kind of
[15:34] stare at each other for a while thinking
[15:35] um
[15:36] you know there's a lot there but the
[15:38] bible says about charity it seeks not
[15:40] her own this is what i want when we talk
[15:42] about manipulation
[15:44] uh even the the the word manipulate uh
[15:47] has an innocent meaning to it or it has
[15:49] a way of just thinking something being
[15:51] handled and used for a particular
[15:52] purpose and so manipulation in one sense
[15:55] isn't wrong except that it's come to
[15:57] mean and i'm using in this sense because
[15:59] it's kind of the the tones that the word
[16:01] is used for that it's something that's
[16:03] done for its own advantage or gain when
[16:05] you manipulate somebody you're wanting
[16:08] them to do something essentially for
[16:09] your own gain
[16:11] but then there's a way that you can act
[16:12] to motivate somebody and what you're
[16:13] wanting them to do is accomplish
[16:15] something for their own benefit so
[16:16] there's a difference between being
[16:17] manipulated and motivated
[16:19] it'd be really good to know when that's
[16:21] happening right at all time lord give me
[16:23] the gift of knowing the difference
[16:25] between manipulation and motivation and
[16:27] give you the courage to act upon it
[16:28] accordingly and so then the bible says
[16:31] that charity seeks not her own it's
[16:32] selfless
[16:34] it's selfless in that it does not act
[16:36] for its own advantage it does not act
[16:39] solely for its own gain but it will act
[16:41] also for your benefit and for your gain
[16:44] so it's not just merely if you look at
[16:46] god and his objective and his plan he's
[16:48] not looking that everything would just
[16:49] work out so that he is magnified and he
[16:52] is great and he is exalted and christ
[16:54] has declared the ruler and the king of
[16:56] all but that he might also share his
[16:59] glory with you
[17:01] and so it's not it's it's when it says
[17:03] that charity seeks not her own we cannot
[17:05] say oh well charity is so selfless and
[17:07] so unselfish that it can be completely
[17:10] manipulated and taken advantage of and
[17:12] left wasted to where nothing exists but
[17:15] it means more that it will not solely
[17:17] act for its own benefit but it acts for
[17:19] your benefit as well
[17:22] as paul writes in second corinthians
[17:24] chapter 5 verse 14
[17:26] we're drawing a lot from first and
[17:27] second corinthians he says for the love
[17:29] of christ constraineth us and we used
[17:32] this last time the love of christ
[17:34] constraineth us it means it holds us
[17:36] together lest we would fall to pieces it
[17:39] means it presses me in and holds me
[17:40] together on every side it holds complete
[17:42] it binds me
[17:44] it sets boundaries about me and holds me
[17:47] together and paul is saying my conduct
[17:49] has been restrained because of the love
[17:51] of christ the love of christ can
[17:52] actually say
[17:53] stop there
[17:55] the love of christ is holding me
[17:56] together and keeping me from flowing out
[17:58] into this and gushing about that or
[18:00] being too harsh about this paul is
[18:02] saying that i am
[18:03] i'm restrained by love because i have to
[18:05] act according to the word and also for
[18:08] your benefit
[18:10] we cannot be
[18:12] masters of tearing things down
[18:15] without also being a master of building
[18:18] back up
[18:19] what was one of the things that we
[18:21] identified in the series on who is my
[18:23] neighbor where this
[18:25] this robber was left we talked about are
[18:27] we the thieves
[18:29] we take somebody and strip them of
[18:30] everything they believe and all their
[18:32] convictions and you strip them from
[18:33] their wilderness and you strip them from
[18:35] everything that's wrong but you give
[18:37] them nothing
[18:38] to be clothed with you give them no
[18:39] truth and we have to be very careful
[18:41] that we're not thieves where we're just
[18:43] constantly taking things away from
[18:44] people
[18:45] and stripping them and laying them bare
[18:47] and so paul is saying my conduct is
[18:49] restrained to act according to the word
[18:51] but then that word must also be
[18:53] effective and beneficial for its
[18:55] intended recipient
[18:57] and we were making reference to this
[18:59] that love is is protective of god's
[19:02] purpose
[19:04] so if it's going to act it always keeps
[19:06] in mind what the overall objective is
[19:09] and you find that in some organizations
[19:12] and
[19:13] certain maybe it's more corporate
[19:15] dynamics and maybe certain operating
[19:16] groups
[19:19] and maybe just at a loss for the word
[19:20] that maybe would kind of gather a lot of
[19:22] these different situations in but they
[19:25] have kind of an overall objective
[19:28] and so they don't need to necessarily
[19:29] give all the specifics of what you
[19:31] should do in this situation what you
[19:32] should do in that situation and they
[19:34] don't have to answer everything and have
[19:36] a manual that says well when this
[19:37] happens do this but they can just give
[19:39] kind of an overarching theme and say you
[19:41] know what at the end of the day our goal
[19:43] is to accomplish this and so in
[19:45] everything you do ask yourself will it
[19:48] meet that objective in the end is this
[19:50] is this being accomplished is this
[19:52] purpose and this vision and this
[19:54] objective being supported through these
[19:55] activities we say that love is the same
[19:58] way in that it acts fiercely protective
[20:00] of god's purpose and it's always it
[20:03] always looks back to what god's intent
[20:06] is and looks forward to what the outcome
[20:08] will be in god's eyes
[20:11] and it may be
[20:13] offensive and as you can see i'm wanting
[20:16] to be sure that we kind of recognize
[20:18] that there can be what is offense
[20:21] but it is it never harms god's objective
[20:25] romans 13 10 says love worketh no ill to
[20:28] his neighbor
[20:30] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[20:32] law
[20:34] i mean that's
[20:35] that's heavy stuff isn't it
[20:37] to think that even paul is he's picking
[20:39] up what jesus says and and all the laws
[20:42] and all the prophets hang on this
[20:44] these commandments love worketh no ill
[20:47] no evil
[20:49] to his neighbor therefore love is the
[20:51] fulfilling of the law there's something
[20:53] so remarkable expressed in that
[20:57] that
[20:57] it's worth pondering and it was one of
[20:59] the things that god immediately remember
[21:01] it was in june of 2020 brother mike i'm
[21:04] thinking of when we were in happy
[21:06] belated birthday i was thinking about
[21:08] how we were sitting down and just it
[21:10] crystallized god has called me to start
[21:12] a church here
[21:13] in phoenix and immediately god began to
[21:16] deal with martyr who is my neighbor
[21:18] and and when i look back and see that
[21:20] it's the that the working no ill to your
[21:23] neighbor is it shows that love is the
[21:25] fulfilling
[21:26] of the law this is something that has a
[21:28] lot of weight to it a lot of depth to it
[21:30] not this shallow
[21:32] ecclesiastical love not the shallow
[21:34] theological love not not the christian
[21:36] scientist kind of love and and not the
[21:39] love that has no limits in the world
[21:40] today but something that's rooted in the
[21:42] character of god
[21:45] love restrains us from evil he says love
[21:47] worketh no ill to his neighbor it does
[21:48] not injure does not defile does not a
[21:51] defraud does not deprive
[21:54] love is not going to defraud somebody
[21:57] else love is not going to deprive
[21:59] someone else what they're do
[22:02] love will also not
[22:04] grant to one
[22:05] something that would
[22:07] harm them
[22:10] unreasonably so we talked
[22:13] we mentioned i think it was as we were
[22:14] closing last time how that love is not
[22:16] pushy
[22:18] uh sometimes we we say well i'm doing
[22:20] this out of love you're like really
[22:22] well you could have smiled
[22:25] oh
[22:26] and uh maybe you say brother aaron take
[22:27] some of your own medicine because i i
[22:29] think uh sometimes i preach and i'm
[22:30] preaching about the love of god and it's
[22:32] almost like i have my teeth clenched
[22:34] but love is not pushy now there's a
[22:36] there's not a pressure and i that the
[22:37] world would use this force and i find
[22:40] myself kind of chasing something where
[22:42] brother branham identifies it the church
[22:44] age book and it's something that i've
[22:45] been very very moved by
[22:47] how that we could use this idea of love
[22:49] but you find at the end of the day it's
[22:51] this force that's being used to
[22:53] accomplish something
[22:54] i had a coach in high school baseball
[22:57] that used fear as a motivator
[22:59] and that's what he felt fear is a great
[23:00] motivator fear's a great motivator and
[23:02] you find that god does not use fear to
[23:05] motivate
[23:06] he uses he motivates by faith
[23:09] and so if fear is being used it's not
[23:11] really at the end of the day the
[23:13] motivation of god but it's the
[23:14] manipulation of emotions and and other
[23:17] factors if we couldn't say maybe just an
[23:19] evil at worst it's the devil at best
[23:21] it's yourself or your friend or whatever
[23:23] it is but love is not doesn't have that
[23:25] kind of force to manipulate
[23:27] and it's not a pushover
[23:29] in that it can be pressured itself or
[23:31] coerced or manipulated into doing
[23:34] something that doesn't reflect the
[23:36] nature and character of a christian and
[23:38] that way i'm saying love has limits
[23:40] the love of god is in your heart the
[23:42] bible says if you if the love of god is
[23:44] in you but you love you know if you love
[23:46] the things of the world and you and you
[23:47] have a love for the things it says the
[23:48] love of god is not in you okay
[23:52] that's that's signaling something that
[23:53] man there's a context for love that we
[23:55] have to grasp and understand
[23:58] now whether we realize it or not you
[23:59] might recognize
[24:01] a little bit of a transition here
[24:03] whether we realize it or not we all have
[24:05] personal thresholds
[24:09] anybody heard the phrase pain tolerance
[24:14] i feel like i've got a high pain
[24:15] tolerance but i still don't like pain
[24:19] i i never quite understood the concept
[24:20] of a haunted house
[24:23] why would i want to walk through
[24:25] something and scare myself to death why
[24:27] do i don't subject myself to that but
[24:28] some other people like man
[24:30] can they not come up with a message
[24:31] haunted house like a christian themed
[24:34] haunted house i mean i really want to
[24:35] spit you know i want to really want to
[24:37] lean into halloween or whatever horror
[24:39] movies is there a christian horror genre
[24:41] and i'm like why would you even want to
[24:42] do that
[24:43] what's the point
[24:45] and so some people have different
[24:46] thresholds and what they consider to be
[24:48] fun and what they consider to be uh
[24:51] enjoyable and so it's in that way i want
[24:53] you to begin to think that some people
[24:55] like like hot stuff right
[24:58] you know and they give say wow i like it
[24:59] hot and you realize they don't care
[25:01] about the taste
[25:02] they just don't want to feel anything
[25:04] once this thing just bites into them so
[25:06] hard
[25:07] it's like yeah that's really hot it has
[25:08] no taste no flavor it's just there to
[25:10] inflict pain
[25:12] and there's some people that really like
[25:13] that
[25:14] and i'm like you know what i like spicy
[25:16] but i don't like that
[25:19] and so that's just saying that there's
[25:20] people have thresholds they have um
[25:23] things and i mention it in an external
[25:25] way but what i want you to begin to
[25:27] think about is more of internal
[25:29] boundaries that we all have these
[25:30] personal thresholds that may not be
[25:32] obvious on the outside
[25:34] defining our physical boundaries is very
[25:36] easy
[25:37] right this body's wearing this suit you
[25:39] know exactly where i'm at you know i'm
[25:41] not walking up and down the aisles right
[25:43] now you can see me and so this is
[25:45] defining my space we have physical
[25:47] boundaries and it's easier to recognize
[25:49] those because we can recognize our
[25:51] external limits even if you want to
[25:53] think it turns out how high you can jump
[25:54] or how fast you can run or how far you
[25:56] can see we have all sorts of ways of
[25:58] defining what are our boundaries and our
[26:00] limits and our extent of of existence
[26:04] and that would extend to as a church we
[26:06] don't have a physical building that we
[26:08] own but we gather here uh and we're
[26:10] within these four walls and there's a
[26:12] way that we can define space to say yeah
[26:14] these are boundaries
[26:16] and we can readily identify structures
[26:19] as establishing someone's personal space
[26:21] personal property the external things
[26:24] the tangible things the physical things
[26:26] but what's harder to see are the
[26:27] boundaries that are related to personal
[26:29] limits
[26:30] you realize that if i'm here i can't be
[26:32] there at the same time if i'm here
[26:34] behind the pulp and i can't be in my car
[26:36] uh um if you're at home streaming you're
[26:38] not here in church there's a way that
[26:40] you immediately begin to recognize these
[26:42] are limits but what are harder to
[26:44] recognize is things that are not seen
[26:48] there's uh ways that we even we begin to
[26:51] look at somebody and we're trying to
[26:52] gauge their response and how are they
[26:54] reacting and how are they responding and
[26:56] i remember in high school there was
[26:58] i had a friend that i joked in a
[26:59] particular way with them and he always
[27:01] seemed to kind of laugh and and he never
[27:03] seemed to be offended but i asked him
[27:05] one day i said david does that bother
[27:06] you and he said oh yeah every time and i
[27:08] felt mortified i was like wow this guy
[27:10] played it off as if we're just having
[27:12] fun you know tell all the jokes you want
[27:14] about me and you realize no that's not
[27:17] everybody it may seem like they're
[27:19] rolling with it it may seem like they're
[27:20] fine but they have something inside of
[27:23] them that's responding to it and you
[27:25] don't see it physically but you're about
[27:27] you're you're crossing some boundary in
[27:29] their heart
[27:31] and so we're talking about things that
[27:33] might be emotional limits spiritual
[27:35] spiritual limits
[27:37] that individuals have
[27:39] and you you know there's there's some
[27:41] people that have a nature about them
[27:43] that they can subject themselves to
[27:44] certain circumstances like i can't do
[27:46] that
[27:47] i i i or that's so or you think other
[27:50] people say why can't you do this and why
[27:51] don't you do that there's just certain
[27:52] things that people are natured a
[27:54] particular way and not everybody's
[27:56] called to the same calling now that
[27:57] one's asked to do the same thing
[27:59] and i'm re we're identifying things that
[28:01] aren't readily identifiable we're
[28:03] talking about things that we may not see
[28:05] on the outside but yet a boundary exists
[28:07] inside
[28:08] the bible says in proverbs 4 23. i want
[28:11] this to be a
[28:13] a critical part
[28:14] of this subject
[28:17] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[28:19] out of it out of the heart are the
[28:22] issues of life
[28:24] we could just get uh
[28:27] deeper and i wanted to say lost but in a
[28:30] real positive way
[28:32] uh jack the other day said something was
[28:34] sick and i was like really and he goes
[28:36] yeah you know like dad in a good way
[28:37] though i'm like
[28:40] my seven-year-old saying something sick
[28:42] but in a good way though dad
[28:44] you got to get hip dad you got to figure
[28:46] out what we're talking about like i feel
[28:48] you i feel you
[28:49] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[28:50] out of it are the issues of life we
[28:52] could get lost in that whole subject how
[28:54] out of the heart are the issues of life
[28:56] but
[28:57] just can you see it that that phrase is
[28:59] very large
[29:00] out of the heart are all every all the
[29:03] issues of life
[29:04] where does god begin in dealing with us
[29:06] to accept his word your heart i mean
[29:08] it's just however you want to look at it
[29:10] what are we forming in our children as
[29:11] we raise them the heart what is it that
[29:13] we act from as adults the heart there's
[29:15] so much that's expressed to this for out
[29:17] of the heart of the issues of life so
[29:18] the bible says keep your heart with all
[29:21] diligence
[29:22] we can spend the rest of the service
[29:23] just on diligence but it says keep it
[29:25] means guard watch over keep blockaded
[29:29] put boundaries around your heart guard
[29:30] with fidelity keep from dangers we're
[29:33] actually told not to not to open up our
[29:36] hearts to harm and not open up our
[29:38] hearts to things that aren't righteous
[29:39] and open up our hearts to evil and say
[29:41] well you're a christian you should rip
[29:43] your chest cavity open and invite the
[29:46] spears like you're some sort of william
[29:47] wallace
[29:49] and take them all into you but you have
[29:50] the sense of no i've got to guard my
[29:52] heart i have to keep it from dangers
[29:57] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 13
[30:00] i had had these in the slide last time
[30:02] and couldn't get to them there have
[30:05] no temptation taken you but such is
[30:07] common to man
[30:09] don't ever think you're going through
[30:10] something that somebody else hasn't gone
[30:12] through
[30:13] it may not have the specific uh details
[30:16] in terms of date time temperature zip
[30:19] code names faces blood relations
[30:21] whatever it might be but there is no
[30:23] temptation that has taken you
[30:26] that hasn't been common that is not
[30:27] common to man
[30:29] but god is faithful
[30:31] remember this phrase god is faithful who
[30:34] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[30:37] that ye are able
[30:39] but will with the temptation also make a
[30:42] way to escape that you may be able to
[30:45] bear it
[30:46] can i paraphrase it god will not push
[30:48] you beyond your limit
[30:50] it says god is faithful so this is this
[30:53] is the attribute of characteristic of
[30:54] god god who is love is faithful and in
[30:57] his faithfulness he will not allow you
[30:59] to be tempted beyond what you can bear
[31:02] beyond what you can handle now notice
[31:05] that doesn't mean he doesn't allow
[31:07] something to come
[31:09] that would push
[31:11] you that would that would bring you to
[31:13] the brink but says that god as you would
[31:16] approach that he makes a way of escape
[31:19] you recognize that this is god's love
[31:22] he's very conscious and aware of limits
[31:25] he knows he knows your boundaries
[31:27] and he also knows your barriers
[31:29] he knows the things that you should not
[31:31] shrink from
[31:32] that there's ways that we have
[31:34] uh if you can think of it this way if we
[31:37] have
[31:38] uh
[31:39] promises that we want to possess we want
[31:41] to grow to a hundredfold there's things
[31:43] in the word of god that are we ought to
[31:45] ask god is scripturally to expand
[31:47] enlarge my heart expand my borders lord
[31:50] there's a way that we can live in our
[31:52] lives we've just retreated down
[31:54] to something very very small
[31:57] and we're not living in the fullness of
[31:58] the promises we're not advancing forward
[32:00] in possessing the promised land we're
[32:02] not seeing that our hearts are being
[32:04] enlarged and but we don't see
[32:06] necessarily any barriers you've just
[32:07] retreated you've just shrunk back
[32:10] and god oh your boundaries are also
[32:12] conscious of your barriers
[32:14] and so it says god is faithful who not
[32:16] suffer you he will not allow you he will
[32:18] not stuff you to be tempted above that
[32:19] you are able to bear there is a measure
[32:22] that god has determined he's determined
[32:24] to measure that god is faithful that
[32:26] there's a point at which he says now at
[32:28] this point here at this extent
[32:31] i'm giving you a a a relief
[32:34] i'm giving you a deliverance a way to
[32:36] escape
[32:37] and the way to escape we could envision
[32:39] it as you're being pressed in you're
[32:40] being pressed in and also there's a door
[32:42] that you could get out of it and
[32:44] there's there's nothing wrong with that
[32:45] analogy in the sense that just whatever
[32:47] it is to relieve you
[32:50] from this pressure
[32:52] looking as if it's going to push you and
[32:54] spill you over
[32:56] into harm or push you into something
[32:59] that is beyond what you're able to bear
[33:02] and and so the scripture says a way of
[33:04] escape that you may be able to bear it
[33:07] it means that you are you have power to
[33:08] bear up against it
[33:11] so it it the way of escape isn't always
[33:14] oh come here i come oh no oh no it's
[33:16] going to destroy me and it's going
[33:18] where'd it go
[33:19] where did it go it's all gone isn't that
[33:21] awesome it's all gone but you you come
[33:23] up and you're able to just
[33:25] submit yourself to the lord and resist
[33:27] the devil and you find yourself there
[33:29] with that power of resistance you find
[33:30] yourself there with power to bear up
[33:32] against it
[33:35] and so god permits temptation he allows
[33:38] the affliction
[33:39] but he also
[33:41] limits
[33:42] how far it can go he has a limit in
[33:44] other words he says i'm going to give
[33:46] you a way of escape power to bear up
[33:47] against it it can only go so far
[33:49] in acts chapter 15 verse 28 for it
[33:51] seemed good to the holy ghost and
[33:54] lay upon you no greater burden than
[33:56] these necessary things and the
[33:58] establishment of the christian church
[33:59] and how the the gentiles are coming to
[34:02] the truth and mike could you imagine if
[34:03] you're a gentile like i got to catch up
[34:05] on all this judaism i got to keep all
[34:07] these different ordinances and all these
[34:08] different laws and there's one for
[34:10] everything and i've got to cut my beard
[34:11] a certain way and i've got to do this i
[34:12] got to do that i've got to wash pots and
[34:14] this and wash pots and that and i can't
[34:16] eat this and i can't
[34:17] there's a lot that's being expressed in
[34:19] this principle but he says we it seemed
[34:21] good to the holy ghost
[34:24] to not lay upon you no greater burden
[34:27] than these necessary things
[34:30] so necessary things may be
[34:32] burdensome but we're not going to put
[34:35] anything more on you
[34:37] than what is necessary
[34:39] this is the love of god that we keep his
[34:41] commandments and his commandments though
[34:42] burdensome are not grievous
[34:46] and so there's something being expressed
[34:47] here where the holy ghost thought said
[34:49] it was good it seemed good to the holy
[34:51] ghost and they concurred in their
[34:52] spirits that they were not going to lay
[34:54] upon them anything greater than what was
[34:55] necessary because if it's beyond what's
[34:58] necessary it's a burden too great
[35:01] revelations chapter 2 verse 24. i know
[35:03] there's more to unpack in these but i
[35:04] want you just to see this phrasing will
[35:06] not suffer to be tempted above that
[35:08] which you're able to bear
[35:10] lay upon you no greater burden
[35:13] revelations 2 24 but i say
[35:15] but unto you i say and unto the rest in
[35:18] thy torah as many as have not this
[35:20] doctrine which have not known the depths
[35:22] of satan as they speak
[35:23] so this doctrine and knowing the depths
[35:25] is a certain
[35:26] understanding they have i will put upon
[35:28] you none other burden
[35:32] i will not place upon you no more
[35:34] affliction i will put on you no more
[35:36] tribulation
[35:37] i will not put upon you any more
[35:40] requirement beyond your reach
[35:42] you know this doctrine you know this
[35:44] depth of satan i will not require more
[35:46] of you than that in this age
[35:49] there's a there's a something being
[35:51] measured out and
[35:53] i
[35:54] i had these i had these
[35:56] scriptures to use at the beginning and i
[36:00] pushed them forward maybe to use next
[36:02] service
[36:03] that whatever but whatever judgment you
[36:05] judge you'll be judged with and there's
[36:06] great teaching that christ uses on
[36:08] judgment
[36:09] actually saying that in this age and
[36:11] this time this is the measure that i'm
[36:13] going to require of you and i won't
[36:14] require more
[36:16] there's there's certainly more
[36:18] right but this is i'm not going to put
[36:20] on you no greater burden no more
[36:22] affliction no more tribulation no more
[36:23] requirement beyond your reach beyond
[36:25] what you're able beyond what you
[36:26] understand i'm only going to judge you
[36:28] by what i've shown you
[36:30] what beautiful grace is being expressed
[36:32] in this i will not suffer you god has
[36:34] faith i won't suffer you to be tempted
[36:36] above that which you're able to bear i
[36:37] will place upon you no greater burn than
[36:39] is necessary i will put on you none
[36:41] other burden god recognizes thresholds
[36:46] god recognizes limits and if i can say
[36:48] this his love knows your limits
[36:51] just just allow your hearts to grab a
[36:52] hold of that this morning is i hope just
[36:54] to uh maybe catch some momentum and
[36:56] preach through this his love knows your
[36:59] limits
[37:01] and his love for you and his knowledge
[37:03] of your heart and who you are and what
[37:05] you can endure and what you can go
[37:07] through that is the protection that we
[37:09] must seek that is that is what we must
[37:11] submit to you're not submitting to this
[37:14] uh to these rules and regulations you're
[37:16] not submitting to an impersonal god
[37:18] you're not submitting to a dictator
[37:21] you're not submitting to a bro he's
[37:22] god's let's just serve him but it's a
[37:24] god that loves you and it's a god that
[37:27] you must that's the protection you must
[37:29] seek and that's what we must submit to
[37:34] it's a love that we
[37:36] so
[37:38] often fail to see
[37:41] in people who profess christ
[37:44] there's times in my life where all i
[37:46] wanted to see was christ no matter how
[37:48] it felt no matter what it was i just
[37:50] wanted to see christ
[37:52] and it's the worst feeling
[37:55] to not see it or feel it
[37:59] god recognized his limits in a genesis
[38:01] chapter 22 verse 14 we've used this a
[38:03] lot as a church the last few months
[38:06] there he is
[38:08] on the mount mount moriah and here's
[38:09] abraham called the name of that place
[38:11] jehovah jireh
[38:13] what did god ask abraham to do
[38:15] take your son your only son isaac the
[38:17] fulfillment of all my prophecies to you
[38:19] and the culmination of all these decades
[38:21] of journey and kill him on the mountain
[38:24] and you know what
[38:26] abraham was able to do it
[38:28] because he's not going to tempt abraham
[38:29] beyond what he's able to bear he was not
[38:31] going to put abraham in a position where
[38:33] he's going to despair of his faith and
[38:34] abandon his faith and say oh no there's
[38:36] nothing to it i can't do this. and be
[38:37] protective of the program be protective
[38:39] of his own son be protective of the
[38:41] ideas but he could abandon himself to
[38:43] the cause of god believing you know what
[38:45] god gave me the promise he must be
[38:47] raising up isaac and i have confidence
[38:50] that god knows things and he sees things
[38:52] and he understands so he called that
[38:54] place jehovah jireh as it is said to
[38:56] this day in the mount of lord it shall
[38:59] be seen
[39:00] so it's not just jehovah jireh my
[39:02] provider but it's the god who sees
[39:05] it's the god who knows it's the god who
[39:07] knew what was abraham in abraham's heart
[39:09] it was a god who knew what it would take
[39:11] to bring these things out of abraham he
[39:13] knew abraham was there basking in the
[39:14] glory of the promise of isaac being
[39:16] fulfilled here he is in the flesh but
[39:18] knowing that abraham had one more step
[39:21] to take to come into perfect faith he
[39:23] had one more step to take to come into
[39:25] supreme faith and his faith to be made
[39:27] perfect and his love to be made perfect
[39:30] so god knew just exactly what him to put
[39:32] him through to where that next
[39:34] expression could unfold and so god was a
[39:36] god who sees
[39:39] so he knew not just abraham's limits in
[39:42] the sense that god the love love knows
[39:44] your limits and we say love has no limit
[39:45] so god knows your limits and what you're
[39:47] able to bear but he also knows just
[39:49] really how far you can go
[39:53] because maybe we just want well god you
[39:54] just have to see me as this limited
[39:56] frail weak
[39:58] deplorable person that i am who's bound
[40:00] by sin and lust and and god can say yeah
[40:03] i see that
[40:04] i see what you've been through i know
[40:05] your limits but i also know your
[40:07] potential
[40:09] i know your barriers
[40:11] to your potential
[40:13] love has limits
[40:16] we're talking about identifying a
[40:17] boundary that can be crossed
[40:19] or even barriers
[40:22] to fulfilling limits to filling up our
[40:24] expression but talking about looking at
[40:26] identifying things
[40:28] a line that can be crossed that spills
[40:31] into that greater burden unnecessary
[40:34] things that cause hurt and harm
[40:36] in 2nd corinthians chapter 2 verses 5 to
[40:39] 8 again if you could just
[40:41] recognize that there's this continuity
[40:44] with these things that paul wrote in
[40:45] first corinthians and second corinthians
[40:51] we've already read how the love of
[40:52] christ constrainteth us
[40:54] and i haven't really alluded to it i
[40:56] think most of you would recognize that
[40:57] paul
[40:59] had to deal with some pretty crazy stuff
[41:01] right in the corinthian church we don't
[41:02] have to talk about it this morning
[41:05] i'm speaking of family and um there's
[41:08] this
[41:09] paul has had to deal with it very
[41:10] bluntly this is the love of god acting
[41:12] but now
[41:13] as he's come through it he doesn't want
[41:15] there to be any confusion that love is
[41:17] just this this harsh thing that yeah i
[41:20] really i kicked his teeth in just i had
[41:22] to show him tough love
[41:23] but paul is recognizing uh these i
[41:27] as god
[41:28] recognized it and paul says love has
[41:30] constrained me i've got to act in a way
[41:32] that doesn't cause harm and not not
[41:34] gonna say that it wouldn't be offensive
[41:35] but that it wouldn't cause harm second
[41:36] corinthians chapter two verses five to
[41:38] eight but if any have caused grief he
[41:40] hath not grieved me
[41:42] so i i'm not grieved he's he's wanting
[41:44] them to understand that he's not mad
[41:45] he's not angry he's not grieved
[41:47] part that i may not overcharge you all
[41:51] there's such grace being expressed in
[41:53] his language sufficient to such a man is
[41:55] this punishment
[41:57] which was afflicted of many so he's been
[41:58] afflicted he's been punished been dealt
[42:00] with severely so that contrary-wise you
[42:02] ought rather to forgive him and comfort
[42:04] him
[42:06] all right you've dealt with it but you
[42:08] ought to forgive him and comfort him
[42:10] sometimes we just want people who are
[42:12] wrong to stay wrong right
[42:14] they made a mistake you always want them
[42:15] to be bearing the curse they're wearing
[42:17] the scarlet letter of that mistake
[42:19] sufficient such a man is this punishment
[42:20] which was afflicted of many so that
[42:22] contrary wise you ought rather to
[42:24] forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps
[42:27] oh it's so beautiful let's perhaps such
[42:30] a one should be swallowed up with over
[42:33] much sorrow
[42:34] but he deserves it right
[42:36] i mean seriously he deserves it
[42:39] wherefore i beseech you that you would
[42:41] confirm your love to him
[42:45] he's saying i'm not grieved if he have
[42:46] caused grief he hath not grieved me
[42:49] he has not grieved me i i am not
[42:52] uh
[42:53] mad at him i'm not angry i'm not i
[42:55] haven't crossed some
[42:57] personal i haven't reached the tipping
[43:00] point where i've just fed up pulling my
[43:01] hair out and he says that i may not
[43:03] overcharge which means to put a burden
[43:05] upon someone to load them up to be
[43:07] burdensome and it but it says to
[43:09] overcharge it means to burden beyond
[43:11] some limit
[43:13] and he wants to charge them but he
[43:15] doesn't want to overcharge them and
[43:17] notice how he says lest perhaps he says
[43:19] you ought to forgive him and comfort him
[43:21] forgive him comfort him as he opened up
[43:22] the very chapter with the comfort of god
[43:25] and whereby we're comforted one another
[43:26] and affliction in these things the theme
[43:27] is continuing he says that he should not
[43:30] perhaps such a one would be you have to
[43:32] act this way forgive and comfort unless
[43:34] perhaps such one should be swallowed up
[43:37] that means drown
[43:39] be devoured or destroyed with over much
[43:41] that means exceeding some measure you
[43:43] get it not that he would experience
[43:46] sorrow but he would be swallowed up
[43:48] devoured and destroyed by too much
[43:51] sorrow or something that exceeds the
[43:52] measure and the star means grief for
[43:53] heaviness
[43:55] so whenever you address the situation
[43:56] and we recognize this as parents that
[43:58] when we we were dealing with the child
[44:00] and addressing an offense we want them
[44:02] to feel sorrow
[44:04] we want them to feel remorse we want
[44:05] them to recognize that what they have
[44:07] done is hurtful or it's not right it's
[44:09] not appropriate they must feel that but
[44:11] what we don't want them to be take place
[44:13] is for them to be swallowed up or
[44:15] drowned with too much grief too much
[44:19] heaviness we don't want them to be
[44:20] broken we don't want them to be
[44:21] frustrated so there's a measure that
[44:24] you're wanting to
[44:25] bring them to in terms of sorrow and
[44:28] recognition of wrong recognition of
[44:29] offense but there's a point there's a
[44:31] limit
[44:34] because if you push it too far paul is
[44:35] saying he could be swallowed up drowned
[44:37] with too much grief too much heaviness
[44:39] like but he's wrong look what he did can
[44:41] you not see that this this deserves the
[44:43] harshest the severest severest the
[44:46] punishment punishment must fit the crime
[44:48] he said yeah then it can't go too far
[44:52] it doesn't mean that once once you've
[44:54] done this and then all is fair and the
[44:56] punishment so he says confirm your love
[45:02] you ought to rather forgive him and
[45:03] comfort him that you would confirm your
[45:05] love to them in other words enough is
[45:07] enough
[45:09] you've punished them enough you've
[45:10] ostracized them enough you've ridiculed
[45:11] them enough and may i know i'm putting
[45:13] words in paul's mouth but however you
[45:15] think you would deal with a situation
[45:16] like that in whatever self-righteous way
[45:19] that we would want to make ourselves
[45:20] feel better for not doing what he did
[45:22] however the politics were playing out in
[45:24] that church and however they might have
[45:25] played out in your life or how you would
[45:27] handle it yourself he's saying confirm
[45:29] your love in other words enough is
[45:31] enough now is the time to reinforce
[45:33] support now is the time to express love
[45:36] no more cold treatment no more
[45:38] gaslighting no more ghosting no more uh
[45:41] ostracizing no more manipulation or
[45:43] abuse or control uh but now is a time
[45:46] for him to understand that he has
[45:48] forgiven and he is loved
[45:51] and this is only appropriate after it
[45:52] has been addressed and
[45:54] and uh
[45:55] he says that there's a grief there
[45:56] there's a sorrow there he's acknowledged
[45:58] it and you look at what zeal and what
[46:00] enthusiasm he paul identifies the way it
[46:02] was handled so he says hey enough's
[46:04] enough
[46:06] and this is love manifested
[46:08] it's manifested in the same enough
[46:12] it's manifest in the way that paul is
[46:13] saying you know what
[46:14] maybe this no more
[46:17] now change
[46:19] and sufficient is his punishment and
[46:20] enough's been done i don't want to
[46:22] overcharge you all so i'm letting you
[46:23] know where i stand and you ought to also
[46:26] forgive him and comfort him don't let it
[46:28] exceed this boundary don't let it exceed
[46:30] this threshold no more paul is saying
[46:33] i'm very conscious of what this man's
[46:35] limits are
[46:37] and this is the line that you shouldn't
[46:39] cross now is the time to confirm your
[46:41] love towards them
[46:44] i hope that you've stayed with me to
[46:46] this point and you
[46:47] can see these things scripturally
[46:49] because i want to use another example so
[46:51] that we could recognize this god has
[46:53] designed our bodies and our spirit being
[46:55] three part being soul spirit body notice
[46:58] how even god has set boundaries and
[47:00] parameters to your person
[47:02] you're not just this malaise and mixture
[47:04] and this amalgamation of different
[47:06] things like what part is that well i'm
[47:07] not really sure where the soul is and
[47:08] where the spirit is where the body is
[47:10] we're just kind of these blobs right
[47:11] these free-floating shape-shifting
[47:13] lizards
[47:15] but we are uh we are
[47:17] carefully curated by god and designed by
[47:20] god
[47:21] and so god has designed our body and our
[47:24] spirit in such a way
[47:25] that it has limits
[47:28] outlets channels and you see where i
[47:29] could go with this to just be very
[47:31] precise the way that we define our body
[47:32] and our spirit now what i want to just
[47:35] zero in on very very precisely very in a
[47:38] very detailed way is how that god has
[47:41] designed both the spirit and the body
[47:43] with certain ways that it responds to
[47:46] things
[47:47] to indicate harm or to warn us of danger
[47:51] that's what the feeling of pain is in
[47:53] the body
[47:55] ooh don't touch that like don't let you
[47:58] set your hand on that any longer than
[47:59] that it's going to start
[48:01] uh burning up your skin so oh that's hot
[48:04] right oh don't do that or there's danger
[48:06] there's a sense of danger notice in our
[48:08] family that some of our children have a
[48:10] very robust sense of danger and if you
[48:12] put them in a precarious situation like
[48:13] whoa whoa whoa no and then another one
[48:15] just kind of takes to it like
[48:17] i like this feeling oh that's danger
[48:19] danger good right there's just if if
[48:22] there's a if there's a swimming pool i
[48:24] don't know how to swim but let me jump
[48:25] in it because that's what water is for
[48:26] if there's a if there's a ledge let me
[48:28] climb up to it if there's and it's just
[48:30] a different barometer different kind of
[48:32] sense of something but god gives us
[48:35] these things to to warn us of danger
[48:38] and the bible says to
[48:39] keep thy heart with all diligence
[48:42] it also tells us that our body is a
[48:44] temple
[48:45] and there's and this principle is so
[48:48] important
[48:50] and i want to mention it and hopefully
[48:52] come
[48:53] come to it later
[48:55] that we must we must and the word of god
[48:58] exist
[48:59] so that we protect our bodies and we
[49:01] protect our spirits
[49:03] like sanctification just isn't for the
[49:04] sake of being different
[49:06] right
[49:08] physical sanctification spiritual
[49:09] sanctification isn't just so we can be
[49:10] like
[49:12] the mormons got nothing on us right
[49:15] we there's a it's for it's for our
[49:17] ultimate protection
[49:19] and so the bible is telling us that it
[49:20] to the body is a temple and to guard our
[49:23] hearts it's saying that there are harms
[49:25] that we must avoid keep thy heart with
[49:26] all diligence keep away from dangers
[49:29] others some of you may have heard of dr
[49:31] gabor mate
[49:32] he wrote a book when the body says no
[49:35] i think in the united states the book
[49:37] was like
[49:38] something about
[49:39] stress and disease a correlation a
[49:41] connection to stress and disease but
[49:42] more globally it was the hidden cost of
[49:44] stress
[49:46] is the title of the book when the body
[49:48] says no the hidden cost of stress
[49:50] anybody heard this book before
[49:53] awesome
[49:54] okay i think my wife raised her hand
[49:56] nobody else
[49:59] so i'm not endorsing the book
[50:00] necessarily so don't go on amazon right
[50:02] now and have it delivered
[50:04] immediately
[50:06] it's coming in the door 12 copies for
[50:08] everyone to chat fact check me
[50:12] but the principle of this book
[50:14] is kind of one of the uh
[50:15] i want to express this in a very narrow
[50:18] way to under just make the point so this
[50:19] isn't gospel this is an analogy within
[50:22] the body that science
[50:24] um uh you know medical science is kind
[50:28] of looking at and recognizing very
[50:30] interesting swing in this
[50:32] this view
[50:33] but kind of the premises that our our
[50:35] body our immune system doesn't exist
[50:37] doesn't exist in isolation from our
[50:39] daily experience
[50:41] so you have an immune system and you
[50:42] can't just look at that
[50:44] uh
[50:45] as it's something of itself and like
[50:47] well this is the immune system that's
[50:48] the way it should operate this is how it
[50:49] should respond to something and kind of
[50:51] isolate it from what you're going
[50:52] through every day
[50:54] that's why people start getting sick and
[50:56] like well school just started right or
[50:58] this happened or that happened and
[51:00] there's certain things that take place i
[51:01] ever get the feeling you start getting a
[51:03] sore throat and what do you say i'm run
[51:05] down
[51:06] right there's something where you're
[51:07] kind of recognizing that my immune
[51:09] system exists within my daily experience
[51:11] my environment
[51:13] and
[51:14] the principle that's being expressed in
[51:15] this or some of the things that's uh
[51:17] being
[51:19] um
[51:20] introduced is how our body can become
[51:22] sick
[51:24] because we endure some excessive harm
[51:27] that there's there's some sort of
[51:29] violation that you go through it so much
[51:31] that eventually it's emotional and it's
[51:34] environmental but eventually it impacts
[51:36] your health
[51:37] and that's what this doctor's saying
[51:39] well we can't look at people's physical
[51:41] uh
[51:42] disabilities and their sicknesses and be
[51:44] like well let's just treat it clinically
[51:46] just based upon
[51:47] what we're looking at scientifically but
[51:49] maybe we should look at it in a broader
[51:50] sense of what's their what are the
[51:52] environmental factors what are the
[51:53] relationship factors what are the things
[51:55] you're going through
[51:56] there was uh
[51:57] and this is very personal
[51:59] but my wife was going through
[52:02] some
[52:03] very very terrible pain and i i hope
[52:05] it's okay it's your heart to say this
[52:07] but she actually thought she was going
[52:09] to diet and she got to so it was so
[52:11] severe that she began to worry
[52:14] am i going to die i'm a wife i'm a
[52:16] mother of young children where is this
[52:18] going to end because it was torment it
[52:19] was debilitating it was very very
[52:20] difficult and so specialist after
[52:22] specialist after specialist even went
[52:24] out of state went to places trying to
[52:25] figure out and every single one of them
[52:27] one after another said it's stress
[52:29] it's stress
[52:31] and then one day
[52:32] one of the doctors said are you in an
[52:34] abusive relationship
[52:36] and i said honey
[52:39] let me answer that question for you
[52:41] no she's not
[52:44] uh and she had to be honest about her
[52:46] situation and thankfully i was absolved
[52:48] i was vindicated i was not the abuser
[52:50] but she had to acknowledge that there
[52:52] were situations she was going through
[52:54] that were abusive emotionally and
[52:55] spiritually
[52:57] and so this is her body's responding to
[52:59] all these other things say well what's
[53:01] your dna what's your family history
[53:02] what's this what's that and they're
[53:03] trying to dig into it scientifically and
[53:05] these doctors are reckoning these are
[53:07] symptoms of stress
[53:09] these are symptoms of things that you're
[53:11] going through that are that are
[53:13] violating something internally and
[53:14] something's being upset and so it starts
[53:16] manifesting itself in the body
[53:18] so the body has a way of signaling hey
[53:20] enough
[53:22] the body has a way of saying this isn't
[53:24] right it doesn't feel good a limit has
[53:27] been reached so you're reaching some
[53:29] physical you could say in a physical
[53:30] sense like that that's hot avoid it or
[53:32] this is this is a dangerous place to be
[53:35] uh you're mentioning some physical
[53:36] threshold but then i want you look at
[53:38] the personal limitations
[53:40] right if you're running and you see
[53:41] something you got to get there and like
[53:42] i i'm not i can't jump over that right
[53:45] you say well i got to swim across this
[53:47] pond to get to the other side i can't do
[53:50] that that's a physical limitation so i'm
[53:51] going to go around it but what about the
[53:53] internal things
[53:55] you're reaching some threshold so the
[53:57] body starts telling you
[53:59] i don't think you can do that
[54:01] there's some people that just don't have
[54:03] that right
[54:04] think i can do it i bet i could jump to
[54:06] that rock how are you going to get back
[54:08] i'll worry about it when i get there
[54:09] right
[54:10] and they just feel like anything's
[54:11] possible in this physical sense but then
[54:13] there's this emotional side
[54:15] i want to use this as an example it's
[54:17] called the death zone
[54:19] for you mountain
[54:20] mountain climbers you immediately
[54:22] recognize this peak as
[54:26] k2
[54:28] the savage mountain
[54:29] i hate to do that to you because i won't
[54:31] get an amen from those dozen people who
[54:32] said everest
[54:35] but this is the second highest mountain
[54:36] and they say it's actually the most
[54:37] difficult to climb
[54:40] but there's 14 peaks that are over 8 000
[54:42] meters they're the 8 000 is what they're
[54:44] called for us
[54:47] and my fellow alpinist
[54:49] call them the 8 thousanders and there's
[54:52] a there's a zone above 8 000 meters
[54:54] that's called the death zone it's called
[54:56] the death zone because it's an altitude
[54:58] the specific altitude where oxygen
[55:00] pressure
[55:01] is insufficient to sustain life human
[55:04] life
[55:06] at this point you cannot live above this
[55:08] threshold
[55:09] sleeping becomes very difficult
[55:11] digesting food they say is nearly
[55:12] impossible the body is unable to
[55:15] acclimatize it means that once you reach
[55:17] go beyond this zone this line and that
[55:20] we're pretty much looking at it here in
[55:21] this k2 picture
[55:24] above 8 000 you can't you can't exist
[55:26] there long enough to the body to finally
[55:28] get used to it
[55:30] and actually climb this mountain k2 you
[55:32] actually have to be there for weeks
[55:34] ahead of time and there's base camp
[55:35] that's so so many thousand meters and
[55:37] there's another camp and you gradually
[55:39] work your way up over a process of weeks
[55:41] it actually takes seven days just to
[55:42] walk in
[55:44] to the base camp anybody want to go
[55:46] mountain climbing with me and there's uh
[55:50] the body you have to take time and your
[55:52] body has to get used to it and it's
[55:53] called acclimatizing and they're
[55:55] adapting to the elevation but then
[55:57] there's a point at which no you know
[55:58] what you you cannot acclimatize
[56:01] you can't spend weeks or days or
[56:03] whatever at that level your body's
[56:05] finding like oh you know what i don't
[56:06] need oxygen anymore we're going to be
[56:07] fine
[56:09] because the body uses oxygen quicker
[56:11] than it can be replenished
[56:14] and so there's a lot of people who use
[56:15] supplemental oxygen when they get above
[56:17] 8 000 meters there's also kind of this
[56:18] niche of people who do it without
[56:20] supplemental oxygen
[56:21] but they realize that in this zone the
[56:24] death zone the body begins to lose
[56:25] certain functions
[56:28] even the mind begins to deteriorate
[56:30] it's the same thing that can happen on
[56:32] the airplane with altitude sickness and
[56:34] the reason why they give you oxygen and
[56:35] you put it on the you put it on yourself
[56:37] first and then help others because
[56:38] you're going to start making wrong kind
[56:40] of judgments and
[56:41] and things are being misperceived and
[56:43] you can't
[56:44] you can't assess risk appropriately and
[56:46] there's so many things begin to break
[56:48] down in the body that ultimately leads
[56:50] to death
[56:52] either by
[56:53] the physical symptoms the lack of oxygen
[56:55] or poor decision making
[56:58] and they have what's called
[56:58] high-altitude cerebral edema
[57:01] i know you guys knew i was going there
[57:02] and you already had it in your notes
[57:05] the haze it's this brain swelling that
[57:07] begins to take place at this above this
[57:09] 8 000 meters and as the brain begins to
[57:11] swell and fluid begins to build and
[57:13] there's also one for the
[57:15] the lungs and the heart where the fluid
[57:16] builds up but this is in the mind i want
[57:18] to think of it in the mind where the
[57:20] mind begins to get disorientated
[57:22] it gets very lethargic
[57:25] gets nauseous
[57:26] well it sounds a lot like depression
[57:28] doesn't it
[57:29] that you come to this place there's so
[57:30] much pressure there's so many things
[57:32] swelling there's so much over burning
[57:33] and taxing because you begin to get
[57:35] disorientated you get lethargic you get
[57:37] nauseous it's all in this danger zone
[57:40] called the death zone
[57:42] you've gone past a certain altitude it's
[57:44] like no man is meant to live there
[57:47] you can perform a time and there can be
[57:49] something that's given to you and you
[57:51] even for a purpose
[57:53] back into the death zone to save other
[57:55] climbers and really kind of the rule is
[57:57] you have to fend for yourself you have
[57:58] to look out after yourself but there's
[58:00] some that will do it for a moment i'm
[58:02] doing it for the purpose of getting to
[58:03] the summit but i can't live here
[58:06] i may be able to exist for a moment but
[58:08] i can't go too far
[58:10] and so this is we're using these
[58:11] examples the body has a way of saying no
[58:14] enough's enough there's this death zone
[58:16] that we could look at in the natural how
[58:17] the human is not meant to live there
[58:19] there's not enough oxygen you cannot get
[58:21] used to it you cannot acclimatize you
[58:23] can't just get thicker skin and get to
[58:25] the place where it doesn't bother you
[58:26] anymore
[58:28] we must recognize the signals the body
[58:30] is sending before it's too late
[58:33] because there's always a price
[58:35] it's always a cost
[58:41] this is a statement from this book when
[58:43] the body says no to have the copies
[58:45] arrived did we have 30 minute prime
[58:47] delivery on that each of us must reclaim
[58:49] the autonomy we lost when we parted
[58:51] company
[58:52] with our ability to feel what was
[58:53] happening within
[58:55] we must take back
[58:57] this individual
[58:59] control
[59:02] uh uh the the take back
[59:06] our right to feel things
[59:08] when they're happening
[59:10] remember last year we ministered on the
[59:11] subject of being numb
[59:12] it was a bad place to be
[59:15] it says that lost capacity for physical
[59:17] and emotional self-awareness is at the
[59:18] root of much of the stress that
[59:20] chronically debilitates health and
[59:22] prepares the ground for disease
[59:25] really this is very very narrow uh i
[59:27] don't say narrow thinking but it's
[59:29] focused it's a very uh um
[59:32] very narrow focus
[59:35] on the cause of disease
[59:37] and and it's substantiated
[59:38] scientifically and i believe if anything
[59:40] it substantiated the message in terms of
[59:42] the factors that cause diseases brother
[59:44] brandon many times could tell that the
[59:46] disease you're experiencing now can be
[59:47] directly related to a stressor a trauma
[59:50] an event
[59:52] and so
[59:53] and even how brother of adam said
[59:55] they're finding that those who hold
[59:56] bitterness in their heart and resentment
[59:59] it leads to sicknesses and disease and
[1:00:00] then there's been a plethora of studies
[1:00:02] ever since then that has substantiated
[1:00:04] those who bear resentments and hurts and
[1:00:06] hold these things within have a greater
[1:00:08] or greater uh more subject to heart
[1:00:10] disease and heart failure and other
[1:00:12] diseases
[1:00:13] so i said that the to not be able to be
[1:00:16] aware of pain to not be able to be aware
[1:00:19] of hurts and harms
[1:00:20] and and to recognize stress that it
[1:00:23] debilitates our health and prepares the
[1:00:25] ground for other diseases he says we we
[1:00:27] can't lose that capacity
[1:00:30] i'm going to use another example of it's
[1:00:31] called hypoglycemia unawareness
[1:00:35] and i know it's a very big word but
[1:00:37] hypoglycemia unawareness is when the
[1:00:39] brain has trouble recognizing low blood
[1:00:42] sugar
[1:00:45] i think my well how in the world does
[1:00:46] that happen
[1:00:47] well because
[1:00:49] the reason what takes place
[1:00:51] is and hypoglycemic unawareness is the
[1:00:54] body doesn't trigger the early symptoms
[1:00:56] of low blood sugar
[1:00:58] because the body's like hey blood
[1:01:00] sugar's low and you might find yourself
[1:01:01] getting a little shaky a little are
[1:01:03] there anybody here that has low blood
[1:01:04] sugar you get kind of clammy you start
[1:01:06] sweating and you your body might start
[1:01:08] shaking a little bit you might begin to
[1:01:09] experience some nausea and all these
[1:01:11] things are kind of saying hey guess what
[1:01:13] your blood sugar is low i mean anybody
[1:01:15] going to get a witness there you go
[1:01:17] and uh and and we have it in our family
[1:01:20] in my extended family so something very
[1:01:23] uh very personally familiar with and i
[1:01:26] know just even the the trauma and the
[1:01:28] anxiety when you get a phone call
[1:01:30] and you don't recognize the number and
[1:01:31] you've something has happened because of
[1:01:33] low blood sugar
[1:01:34] it's something that can happen the body
[1:01:37] usually signals hey this is this is
[1:01:39] happening and that's happening and and
[1:01:42] it's telling you your blood sugar's low
[1:01:45] but
[1:01:46] hypoglycemia unawareness occurs because
[1:01:49] of repeated low blood sugar events
[1:01:52] it happens so frequently it happens so
[1:01:54] often that the body stops recognizing it
[1:01:58] or put another way it stops telling you
[1:02:01] it stops making you nauseous you don't
[1:02:03] get clammy anymore you don't begin to
[1:02:05] experience the symptoms and so your
[1:02:07] body's not saying hey buddy you need
[1:02:09] sugar you just pass out
[1:02:12] and nothing's happened to wake you out
[1:02:14] of sleep nothing's happened to alert you
[1:02:15] hey something's wrong i feel this has
[1:02:17] happened because over and over again you
[1:02:19] have not addressed the problem you do
[1:02:21] not you do not uh moderate and control
[1:02:25] and even through a dietary approach or
[1:02:27] whatever it might be the body constantly
[1:02:29] being afflicted with this trauma
[1:02:30] constantly enduring these low blood
[1:02:32] sugar levels finally stop sending the
[1:02:34] signal
[1:02:35] but the damage is still being done
[1:02:38] it's not like the body says hey you know
[1:02:39] what he's not paying attention no no low
[1:02:41] blood sugar anymore like i beat it i
[1:02:43] beat it
[1:02:44] oh you're gonna die one day
[1:02:48] the body sends the signal but if
[1:02:49] frequently ignored ignored the less the
[1:02:51] body gives the warning
[1:02:55] let's think let's think spiritually
[1:02:56] about this
[1:03:00] dr mate uses an example i believe it's
[1:03:02] in the first chapter of his book of a
[1:03:03] patient named mary
[1:03:05] with these very very difficult uh
[1:03:07] medical symptoms and
[1:03:10] things that were trying to be diagnosed
[1:03:11] and he took time with her one day and
[1:03:13] said tell me your whole story and begin
[1:03:14] to find out things about her childhood
[1:03:16] and things she went through and the kind
[1:03:17] of character
[1:03:18] kind of way she responded to things and
[1:03:22] the the abuses and even the
[1:03:25] um
[1:03:27] things that she was
[1:03:28] endured and he concluded with this he
[1:03:31] says i've often wondered many times how
[1:03:32] mary's life might have turned out
[1:03:35] and and i don't want you to get kind of
[1:03:37] lost in his verbage but just the
[1:03:39] principle i turned out if someone had
[1:03:41] been there to hear see and understand
[1:03:42] her when she was a small child abused
[1:03:45] frightened feeling responsible for her
[1:03:47] little sisters
[1:03:49] he says perhaps had someone been there
[1:03:51] consistently and dependably
[1:03:53] she could have learned to value herself
[1:03:56] to express her feelings
[1:03:58] he says to assert her anger and i think
[1:04:01] that that's
[1:04:02] that's uh to establishing a limit
[1:04:05] when people invaded her boundaries
[1:04:07] physically or emotionally
[1:04:10] he's saying i'm looking at this woman
[1:04:11] and she ultimately died he's saying man
[1:04:13] i wonder how things would have been
[1:04:15] different if she had been able to defend
[1:04:17] her boundaries
[1:04:19] if she had the kind of love and support
[1:04:21] and something had been consistent and
[1:04:22] dependable there'd been some kind of
[1:04:24] comfort there that would have taught her
[1:04:26] to value herself and then have an outlet
[1:04:29] for her feelings and to be able to
[1:04:30] assert her her her rights
[1:04:33] as a person to not be
[1:04:36] trespassed emotionally or physically
[1:04:40] this is a doctor
[1:04:42] kind of with this conjecture about the
[1:04:44] outcome of this person's life
[1:04:47] he said maybe everything that caused her
[1:04:48] to die physically ultimately could be
[1:04:50] traced back to her boundaries
[1:04:52] internally not some environmental toxin
[1:04:56] uh she worked in a factory breathed this
[1:04:57] in she got lung disease and she died not
[1:05:00] not well there was lead in the water not
[1:05:02] not a genetic factor well every you know
[1:05:04] all for generations they all died of
[1:05:06] pancreatic cancer no this is someone as
[1:05:08] a young girl began to endure things
[1:05:10] that led to sickness in the future
[1:05:12] the message teaches us this right
[1:05:14] this isn't foreign to us
[1:05:18] conclusion a direct statement when we
[1:05:21] have been prevented this is actually
[1:05:22] from an article that he wrote when we
[1:05:24] have been prevented from learning how to
[1:05:26] say no our bodies may end up saying it
[1:05:28] for us
[1:05:30] when you have been prevented from saying
[1:05:32] no
[1:05:33] your body starts saying it for you
[1:05:36] when you're not making the decision
[1:05:38] yourself when you're not exercising the
[1:05:40] discernment
[1:05:41] and the the right kind of con your body
[1:05:43] begins to tell you something's not right
[1:05:44] something's not right your spirit's
[1:05:46] being defiled you're a little bit edgy
[1:05:47] you're getting frustrated you're getting
[1:05:48] out you're having these outbursts think
[1:05:50] spiritually now we're not thinking about
[1:05:51] all of us trying to diagnose and google
[1:05:53] and find out we have cancer you're going
[1:05:54] to die we're talking about emotions and
[1:05:56] feelings and being circumspect and being
[1:05:58] uh having a soft answer turn away wrap
[1:06:00] we're talking about the character of
[1:06:02] christ being inhibited barriers to
[1:06:04] expressing the word of god in this hour
[1:06:06] and we have to recognize that maybe
[1:06:08] there's some threshold some limit some
[1:06:10] way that i need to scale back or i need
[1:06:12] to advance forward in when we have been
[1:06:14] prevented from saying no our bodies may
[1:06:16] be saying it for us
[1:06:19] we have we all have limits
[1:06:22] and we must recognize when limits are
[1:06:24] being reached we must recognize when
[1:06:26] something's being exceeded we must
[1:06:28] recognize when not just our body is
[1:06:29] saying no in a physical sense but when
[1:06:31] our heart is saying no
[1:06:33] it's not right i it doesn't feel right
[1:06:35] this isn't who i am this isn't what i
[1:06:37] want to experience
[1:06:40] it's i've been preaching now for an hour
[1:06:42] and i'm going to go into the
[1:06:44] hour after hour here
[1:06:46] as we arrive to our text but this is
[1:06:48] just going to be a very
[1:06:50] very direct line to our clothes
[1:06:53] and second corinthians chapter
[1:06:55] 1 verses to just read verses 8 to 10
[1:06:59] paul experienced this trouble in like
[1:07:01] lystra
[1:07:02] where the persecution was so great and
[1:07:04] even physically how he was
[1:07:07] beset
[1:07:08] he thought they're going to kill me
[1:07:10] i'm dead
[1:07:11] i'm good as a dead man but they'll take
[1:07:13] my body and they'll throw it to the side
[1:07:16] put in a ditch buried in the grave but
[1:07:17] he knew what god had called him to see
[1:07:20] confidence in god's calling
[1:07:22] and so instead of trusting that he could
[1:07:23] escape the persecution figure out a way
[1:07:25] out he just knew
[1:07:27] that god would have to raise him from
[1:07:29] the dead that's a pretty remarkable way
[1:07:30] to look at this but this is exactly what
[1:07:32] he expresses for we would not brother
[1:07:33] and have you ignorant of our trouble
[1:07:34] which came to us in asia
[1:07:36] and this is the phrase that i find so
[1:07:37] unique that we were pressed out of
[1:07:39] measure
[1:07:41] above strength
[1:07:42] in so much that we despaired even of
[1:07:44] life i i don't often maybe use a
[1:07:47] language to express this but god came to
[1:07:50] me multiple times last week to confirm
[1:07:53] that when the body is saying no in this
[1:07:55] scripture and just put them together
[1:07:57] and in very personal ways for me to
[1:07:58] recognize this is the lord this is the
[1:07:59] lord you have liberty to use this
[1:08:01] uh very directly and that there'll be a
[1:08:03] grace for the people to not you know run
[1:08:06] out and buy the book and start living by
[1:08:07] some discipline or have some kind of new
[1:08:10] way of viewing things but just to bring
[1:08:11] it back to the word
[1:08:12] paul saying i want you to know i don't
[1:08:14] want you to be ignorant the fact that we
[1:08:15] were pressed out of measure above
[1:08:17] strength
[1:08:18] in so much that we despaired even of
[1:08:20] life listen to the words of the first
[1:08:22] age
[1:08:23] first church age messenger we were
[1:08:25] pressed out of measure above strength we
[1:08:27] despaired of our lives but we had the
[1:08:29] sentence of death in ourselves we're
[1:08:31] going to die that we should not trust in
[1:08:33] ourselves
[1:08:34] but in god which raiseth the dead it's
[1:08:37] to the point where it wasn't a god who
[1:08:39] would allow him to escape but a god
[1:08:40] remember this is the same one who wrote
[1:08:42] that god will not allow you to be
[1:08:43] tempted above that which you're able but
[1:08:44] with the temptation make a way of escape
[1:08:46] his situation was so dire he thought the
[1:08:48] way of escape was a resurrection
[1:08:52] but in a god which raiseth the dead
[1:08:54] beautiful phrase here in verse 10
[1:08:55] beautiful beautiful make this apply on
[1:08:57] many different levels who delivered us
[1:08:59] from so great of death
[1:09:01] god delivered him
[1:09:03] from that physical death and then he
[1:09:04] testifies and deliver yet still
[1:09:08] the same yesterday and today in whom we
[1:09:10] trust he will yet deliver us
[1:09:13] three-dimensional deliverance full total
[1:09:14] complete perfect deliverance of soul
[1:09:16] spirit and body
[1:09:18] soul has been delivered from sin the
[1:09:20] body one day will be delivered into a
[1:09:21] new body and god wants to deliver your
[1:09:23] spirits also
[1:09:26] he says we were pressed out of measure
[1:09:28] burned beyond what he could bear he's
[1:09:30] saying i reached my limit
[1:09:32] this was more than i could handle he
[1:09:34] says above strength this is beyond my
[1:09:35] own strength paul is being open and
[1:09:38] admitting he was crossed he had crossed
[1:09:39] a threshold
[1:09:41] i said god will not allow you to be
[1:09:43] tempted above that which you're able
[1:09:45] beyond this measure be honest so as paul
[1:09:48] found himself crossing it he then turned
[1:09:51] his direction when it went beyond what
[1:09:52] he could handle he looked to god for the
[1:09:54] way of escape
[1:09:56] because he knew that god is not going to
[1:09:57] put me put me through something that's
[1:09:59] going to devour me destroy me he's
[1:10:01] telling the corinthian church enough
[1:10:03] enough don't do any more because you do
[1:10:05] not want this person to be devoured and
[1:10:07] swallowed up with over much sorrow paul
[1:10:09] i do not want you to be devoured with
[1:10:11] fear and trem tr a trepidation that
[1:10:14] you're going to be destroyed and there's
[1:10:15] going to be a loss of purpose and no
[1:10:16] value to your life he was going to give
[1:10:18] him some comfort to know that all things
[1:10:20] worked together for the good so then he
[1:10:22] began to look to god for deliverance
[1:10:24] because of the revelation that he had
[1:10:26] and i love it as paul wrote it he wasn't
[1:10:28] too proud to express his despair
[1:10:32] he said that we
[1:10:33] despaired even of life
[1:10:36] he said i'm destitute of measure i don't
[1:10:38] have anything else i'm hopeless i've got
[1:10:40] nothing
[1:10:42] and he's and he's he's being honest that
[1:10:45] he's despairing
[1:10:47] but he knew god's promise
[1:10:50] because though he recognized that he had
[1:10:52] his limits and he was pressed
[1:10:54] out of measure above
[1:10:56] strength to where he despaired he feels
[1:10:59] hopeless he had confidence
[1:11:01] that not only did he realize
[1:11:04] that he was crossing this threshold into
[1:11:06] despair but he knew that god knew his
[1:11:08] limits too
[1:11:12] just as this doctor expressed this
[1:11:13] thought about mary says what if she
[1:11:15] would have had somebody dependable
[1:11:17] somebody consistent
[1:11:19] who could guide somebody through their
[1:11:20] pain and their hurts
[1:11:22] what if she had somebody
[1:11:24] who could be there
[1:11:28] he knew that god knew his bounds
[1:11:31] he knew that god was an ever-present
[1:11:32] help in a time of trouble
[1:11:35] and paul was not too proud
[1:11:38] to say i despaired
[1:11:41] i i was reaching my limit i didn't know
[1:11:43] what to do i was hopeless but
[1:11:45] but i trusted in god
[1:11:47] you notice what paul didn't do
[1:11:49] everything's fine right i'm fine
[1:11:52] house is burning down got my coffee
[1:11:54] it's fine
[1:11:56] no paul's a house is on fire this
[1:11:58] coffee's horrible let's get out of here
[1:11:59] we're all gonna die
[1:12:00] paul was honest about it
[1:12:03] and i i want to say this it's very very
[1:12:05] pointed
[1:12:06] may god give me grace to say it
[1:12:09] i'll just say we're all guilty so we can
[1:12:10] take exception personally later we've
[1:12:12] become too good
[1:12:14] at positive thinking
[1:12:17] we've become so good at positive
[1:12:19] thinking this positive thinking to where
[1:12:21] we call all hurts good
[1:12:23] that's fine that's good this is good
[1:12:25] that's good
[1:12:26] and we start misusing scripture and
[1:12:28] promises and certain attributes and
[1:12:30] characteristics of a christian like well
[1:12:31] this is fine this is good that's okay
[1:12:34] and there's a positivity and i could put
[1:12:37] that in air quotes
[1:12:39] for those streaming
[1:12:40] that put it in air quotes where there's
[1:12:41] this positivity that can become a
[1:12:43] harmful coping mechanism
[1:12:46] it's it's not really this robust faith
[1:12:49] and i see the good and you're standing
[1:12:50] on this faith and
[1:12:52] and you're you're very strong and
[1:12:54] courageous this steadfastness where you
[1:12:56] can endure unto the end and you see
[1:12:58] these promises we just kind of get to
[1:13:00] this idea where it's positive thinking
[1:13:01] it's positive thinking disregard the
[1:13:03] hurt disregard the sorrow disregard the
[1:13:05] signals disregard the signs
[1:13:07] and what we don't realize is the
[1:13:08] negative emotions could be signaling
[1:13:10] that something isn't right there's been
[1:13:12] some hurt there's some big violation
[1:13:14] you're in a death zone
[1:13:15] get out of here and go oh no okay
[1:13:18] used to it
[1:13:21] and you think you're going to be fine
[1:13:25] brother you use this statement on
[1:13:27] wednesday night just and i'm not
[1:13:29] recasting a different light i'm just
[1:13:30] bringing it back up in the same way that
[1:13:32] he brought it out and the message how
[1:13:33] can i overcome he says you can't say i
[1:13:35] got a sickness and i don't believe it is
[1:13:37] a sickness
[1:13:38] there's a little bit of whiplash there
[1:13:40] you say well if you had cancer and
[1:13:42] didn't know it never have a negative
[1:13:43] testimony and so this idea we build this
[1:13:45] this sense of
[1:13:46] ignoring the symptoms
[1:13:49] ignoring the circumstances right
[1:13:51] and peter wasn't able to walk on water
[1:13:53] because he ignored the waves he just
[1:13:54] kept his eyes on christ and he knew i'm
[1:13:57] walking on a tumultuous sea
[1:13:59] he didn't envision it as glass
[1:14:02] i'm walking on ice
[1:14:05] he knew the he knew what was going on he
[1:14:07] felt it
[1:14:08] he could see it the billows and but he
[1:14:11] kept his eyes on christ and then when he
[1:14:13] started looking at the circumstances and
[1:14:14] the waves were saying but you can't walk
[1:14:16] on me that's scientifically impossible
[1:14:17] you're right
[1:14:20] so it's not ignoring the symptoms that's
[1:14:21] not faith that's not positive thinking
[1:14:23] that's not confessing the positive
[1:14:26] he says you can't say i got a sickness
[1:14:28] and i don't believe it is a sickness oh
[1:14:29] yes it is a sickness you got cancer i
[1:14:32] know this kind of flies in the face of
[1:14:34] our positive testimony our positive
[1:14:35] confession he says i you don't believe
[1:14:38] it is a cancer it is a cancer it is a
[1:14:40] cancer but remember
[1:14:44] there's an acknowledgement there's a yes
[1:14:45] it's there i see it yes yes but greater
[1:14:48] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:14:50] the world that's the positive testimony
[1:14:53] that's the positive thinking not that
[1:14:54] you trust in yourself and i'm going to
[1:14:56] will myself out of it there's really not
[1:14:57] there doctor you don't know what you're
[1:14:58] talking about whatever you can say i
[1:15:00] know that's what the chart says i know
[1:15:02] that's what the symptoms say i know
[1:15:03] that's what i've got but greater is he
[1:15:05] that is in me than he that is in the
[1:15:07] world sister laura collins cannot be
[1:15:09] laying in her bed right now denying that
[1:15:11] she's sick she knows that she's sick but
[1:15:14] she can say greater is he that is in me
[1:15:16] than he that is in the world you must
[1:15:18] realize that the holy spirit that is in
[1:15:21] you has already overcome this thing
[1:15:24] paul wasn't saying well i'm good enough
[1:15:25] i'm strong enough and when i come up
[1:15:27] against my limits i just dig down deep
[1:15:29] and get him guppy and i can overcome
[1:15:30] this no he's at that point says god
[1:15:32] there's got to be something greater than
[1:15:33] me there's got to be something beyond me
[1:15:36] these are my limits with man this is
[1:15:38] impossible but with god all things are
[1:15:41] possible
[1:15:44] i want to ask you this how many cancers
[1:15:46] have you dealt with and tried to defeat
[1:15:48] by ignoring them instead of using the
[1:15:50] word many cancers
[1:15:53] do we just live with
[1:15:56] how many toxic things how many abuses
[1:15:58] how many things are we just willing to
[1:16:00] live with by ignoring them and using
[1:16:03] positive thinking instead of using the
[1:16:04] word
[1:16:06] you can never defend your boundaries by
[1:16:07] crossing a line
[1:16:10] you can never defend against cancer by
[1:16:12] being a cancer yourself i think i
[1:16:13] mentioned it earlier
[1:16:14] you can't use love and kick somebody in
[1:16:16] the teeth
[1:16:18] you just perpetuate the cycle
[1:16:20] you cannot set your boundaries and
[1:16:22] violate somebody else's at the same time
[1:16:25] enough's enough i gotta say no but you
[1:16:27] cannot be doing it properly
[1:16:29] if you've now crossed somebody else's
[1:16:31] threshold
[1:16:32] now they may not recognize it and you
[1:16:33] may think they deserve a whole lot of
[1:16:35] abuse for what they've done to you or
[1:16:36] you might feel like this is enough's
[1:16:38] enough this is what i got to do but
[1:16:39] listen
[1:16:40] you have to first submit yourself to god
[1:16:42] you've established your parameters you
[1:16:44] you found your place of safety you're
[1:16:47] firmly rooted and planted in this then
[1:16:49] the divine love is projected and saying
[1:16:51] enough's enough
[1:16:53] and you just perpetuate the cycle if you
[1:16:56] then
[1:16:56] in the name of setting
[1:16:58] saying enough's enough you kind of do it
[1:17:00] with the fist
[1:17:02] instead of the heart
[1:17:04] we should never resort to offensiveness
[1:17:06] but we just look to god's word
[1:17:08] god's word will make a way of defense
[1:17:11] the way of escape
[1:17:15] the word is our protection
[1:17:18] the word is our defender
[1:17:21] the word is our healer
[1:17:24] it's a god that heals all your diseases
[1:17:26] body spirit
[1:17:28] he healed the sin disease
[1:17:30] right
[1:17:31] how many have had divine healing
[1:17:34] incredible testimonies of divine healing
[1:17:36] he heals the spirit too he heals the
[1:17:38] mind
[1:17:40] i want to use this last example in first
[1:17:42] kings chapter 19.
[1:17:47] and i
[1:17:48] i want to
[1:17:49] we had used this
[1:17:51] recently after elijah's challenge and
[1:17:53] his sacrifice
[1:17:57] and then after god
[1:18:00] you know there
[1:18:02] on mount carmel
[1:18:04] such an incredible
[1:18:07] vindication
[1:18:08] a showdown
[1:18:11] and after this
[1:18:12] this
[1:18:13] uh
[1:18:14] move of god
[1:18:16] elijah's running from jezebel
[1:18:19] and he's running for his life his bible
[1:18:22] says he went for his life he's running
[1:18:23] for his life he's the spirit of life and
[1:18:25] he's running
[1:18:26] and he comes to a place in verse four
[1:18:28] first kings chapter 19 verse four this
[1:18:30] is my my final scriptures and i just
[1:18:32] have a it's a couple statements i want
[1:18:33] to weave into this but he went in
[1:18:38] and
[1:18:40] his love knows your limits
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:43] we all have a threshold
[1:18:45] we we all have these
[1:18:47] things barriers that are holding us back
[1:18:49] and god knows them
[1:18:50] so he's not just going to just push you
[1:18:52] past it god wants to do it wants to deal
[1:18:53] with it
[1:18:55] what's the beauty of the crossing the
[1:18:56] red sea
[1:18:58] god could have just brought him through
[1:18:59] and got him over there and they would
[1:19:00] have lived every day looking to the
[1:19:02] horizon for pharaoh's chariots to come
[1:19:04] after him
[1:19:06] so god does it in such a way to where
[1:19:08] that enemy would drown
[1:19:10] and they would never fear him anymore if
[1:19:11] he built the bridge they could cross the
[1:19:13] bridge too
[1:19:14] it allowed them to survive and not let
[1:19:16] the enemy pursue him to the point where
[1:19:18] they could be overcome with the flood
[1:19:19] they'd always remember fair has got a
[1:19:20] great army they'll figure out a way
[1:19:22] around eventually
[1:19:24] they'll build the bridge they'll they'll
[1:19:25] come and get us but god had a way of
[1:19:27] bringing you to a place it has a way of
[1:19:29] bringing you to a place where your enemy
[1:19:31] was going to drown in the very thing you
[1:19:33] were afraid of
[1:19:36] and so here's elijah
[1:19:38] keep that in mind even this idea that if
[1:19:40] there could just be something there to
[1:19:42] guide you and comfort you and love you
[1:19:45] protect you
[1:19:47] elijah himself went a day's journey into
[1:19:49] the wilderness and he came and sat under
[1:19:51] a juniper tree
[1:19:54] and listened to the words and he
[1:19:56] requested for himself that he might die
[1:19:59] he's suicidal
[1:20:01] he doesn't want to live anymore
[1:20:02] instead it is enough
[1:20:05] now oh lord take away my life
[1:20:09] for i am not better than my father's
[1:20:12] he looked at who he was
[1:20:13] even what had been
[1:20:15] his family history whatever it might be
[1:20:17] however you want to look at it he says
[1:20:19] it's enough i can't go anymore
[1:20:21] i don't want to live anymore when he
[1:20:22] says it's enough he said it's more than
[1:20:24] i can handle
[1:20:26] and he's actually saying let me die
[1:20:30] how can i be on the mount carmel and now
[1:20:32] run for my life from jezebel and what
[1:20:34] what is what's this mixture of
[1:20:36] vindication and the presence of god and
[1:20:38] fire the slaying of false prophets and
[1:20:40] now look at me i'm no better than anyone
[1:20:42] else i'm running away scared i don't
[1:20:44] even want to live anymore and he says
[1:20:45] it's enough
[1:20:46] it's more than i can handle
[1:20:48] i ask you was elijah weak in faith
[1:20:53] with some deep weakness and his
[1:20:54] confidence exposed and ah elijah's a
[1:20:57] fraud look at him look at the way he's
[1:20:58] acting running from jezebel this proves
[1:21:00] he's just a neurotic this proved he's
[1:21:02] not really a problem this proves there's
[1:21:03] nothing to him look at what he's going
[1:21:05] through personally look what he's
[1:21:06] enduring
[1:21:07] so here he is suicidal under a juniper
[1:21:09] tree feeling sorry for himself wanting
[1:21:11] to die
[1:21:12] and we could think back about moses and
[1:21:14] how moses came to a place where the he's
[1:21:17] crying out to god and god says hey i
[1:21:19] gave you a promise why cries thou unto
[1:21:21] me speak to the people that they go
[1:21:23] forward so here's a situation a prophet
[1:21:25] i don't know what to do and all this
[1:21:27] pressure and everything and he goes to
[1:21:28] god he says oh and he's crying out to
[1:21:30] god and god says stop crying speak to
[1:21:32] the people go forward
[1:21:36] and this is moses in his time of despair
[1:21:38] moses in his time of i'm reaching a
[1:21:40] limit i don't know what to do and god
[1:21:41] says hey i gave you the word i made it
[1:21:43] very very clear why are you crying to me
[1:21:45] i speak to the people that they go
[1:21:47] forward and we can kind of say hey god
[1:21:49] sometimes wants to kick us when we're
[1:21:50] down
[1:21:52] you know and we want to afflict the
[1:21:54] comfort and there's this language you
[1:21:56] begin to use and we can create a
[1:21:57] template of tough love right
[1:21:59] kick him kick him around be tough
[1:22:02] be strong be a man
[1:22:04] come on be a christian
[1:22:06] and there's a way that we're trying to
[1:22:08] uh we're wanting people to be rugged and
[1:22:10] burly and kind of in your face this is
[1:22:12] what a believer do this is a christian
[1:22:14] you don't have enough faith to do this
[1:22:15] then you can't be a christian
[1:22:16] you all need to be baptized again to
[1:22:18] 2022.
[1:22:20] and all these things that we get
[1:22:22] bombarded with and bombarded with and
[1:22:24] god's looking at this situation he dealt
[1:22:26] with moses one way and said hey you know
[1:22:27] what
[1:22:29] quit crying speak and go forward but
[1:22:31] listen to what brother brahman says in
[1:22:32] the message why christ speak many times
[1:22:34] when we look at the scriptures in our
[1:22:36] own way of looking this is an important
[1:22:38] principle i recommend you listen to this
[1:22:40] sermon in july 1463 in our own way of
[1:22:43] thinking it seems very hard
[1:22:45] in our own way of thinking but if we
[1:22:47] study it a little while
[1:22:49] we find out that the all-wise god knows
[1:22:52] just what he's doing
[1:22:54] watch this and he knows how to do these
[1:22:56] things
[1:22:57] and how to deal with man
[1:23:00] he knows what's in man
[1:23:02] he knows him
[1:23:04] we don't
[1:23:06] he knew moses
[1:23:08] he knew his childhood he knew his
[1:23:10] upbringing he knew his training he knew
[1:23:12] his mistakes he knew his deserting and
[1:23:14] running into the wilderness he knew his
[1:23:15] coming back he knew he'd met him on a
[1:23:17] mountain he knew he'd equipped him to
[1:23:18] advance him he knew everything about
[1:23:19] moses so he knew where this man was
[1:23:22] built and where he was standing and he
[1:23:23] knew with moses he said stop crying
[1:23:25] speak and go forward
[1:23:27] he knows him we don't we only know from
[1:23:29] the intellectual side he knows what's
[1:23:32] really in the man
[1:23:37] can you say that for yourself
[1:23:39] he knows what's really in you
[1:23:42] even if you don't see it
[1:23:44] he knows what's really in you and so
[1:23:46] notice how god deals with the gender the
[1:23:48] juniper tree oh lord take away my life
[1:23:51] i'm no better than my father's is it
[1:23:53] enough just let me die and god came by
[1:23:55] says you
[1:23:56] prophet you
[1:23:58] get up
[1:23:59] haven't i vindicated you enough did i
[1:24:01] not just prove myself on mount carmel is
[1:24:03] that the way that god responded
[1:24:07] why cry to me get up and go forward go
[1:24:09] shake your fist in the face of jezebel
[1:24:10] he said and as he lay and slept under a
[1:24:12] juniper tree behold then an angel
[1:24:15] touched him
[1:24:16] and said unto him arise and eat
[1:24:19] and he looked and behold there was a
[1:24:20] cake bacon on the coals and a cruce of
[1:24:22] water at his head and he did eat
[1:24:25] and drink
[1:24:26] and laid him down
[1:24:28] again
[1:24:30] gave him a little bit
[1:24:32] and then said why don't you lay down
[1:24:33] again and the angel lord came again the
[1:24:35] second time
[1:24:37] and touched him
[1:24:38] and said arise and eat notice what the
[1:24:41] message is because the journey is too
[1:24:43] great for thee
[1:24:45] he knew
[1:24:47] with moses like stop crying speak to the
[1:24:49] people that go forward the journey is
[1:24:50] not too great i've done what i need to
[1:24:52] do you just need to at this moment speak
[1:24:55] the word and go forward and sometimes
[1:24:57] like oh speak the word speak the word
[1:25:00] speak the word third pool create them
[1:25:01] squirrels move those mountains and yes
[1:25:03] there's a place that god wants to bring
[1:25:05] us to where we our faith is loose to
[1:25:07] operate in that but some of us need
[1:25:09] first to rise and eat and be ministered
[1:25:13] to and nourished and to grow up and then
[1:25:15] maybe he needs to lay us down again to
[1:25:17] rest and heal a little while and then he
[1:25:19] comes to us to a second time to say
[1:25:21] arise and he because still the journey's
[1:25:23] too great for thee you still need more
[1:25:27] and he arose and did eat and drink
[1:25:30] and went in the strength of that meat
[1:25:33] not just the first time but even with
[1:25:34] the second i'm the strength of that meat
[1:25:36] 40 days and 40 nights unto horeb
[1:25:38] the mount of god
[1:25:40] that was god's response
[1:25:43] when he was looking at a man he knew
[1:25:45] what was in a man
[1:25:47] he knows him
[1:25:48] not from the intellectual side
[1:25:50] not from the side of looking a prophet
[1:25:52] on a mountain doing this and think about
[1:25:53] the way people view prophets and even
[1:25:55] brother branham and how we view one
[1:25:57] another sometimes we're only looking at
[1:25:59] from the intellectual side
[1:26:00] but god sees inside
[1:26:04] and the message if you could all just
[1:26:05] focus
[1:26:07] now
[1:26:08] i read this fast enough i'll finish this
[1:26:11] he said what hearst thou elijah he said
[1:26:13] i imagine
[1:26:16] there's ten thousand angels watching him
[1:26:17] sleep
[1:26:20] there's one assurance the believer has
[1:26:21] though the world turned him down
[1:26:23] yet god loves him
[1:26:26] the world may call you a holy roller
[1:26:27] they may call you a fanatic
[1:26:29] but if you're true to god there's one
[1:26:31] sure thing god loves you
[1:26:33] and his angels are encamped about those
[1:26:35] who fear him
[1:26:37] i'd imagine on every limb all around
[1:26:40] through the place were swarms of angels
[1:26:43] and god came down and he said my poor
[1:26:45] little tired servant
[1:26:47] he's so nervous and tore up he didn't
[1:26:49] know what to do
[1:26:51] i want to pick out the angel standing
[1:26:52] here that's got the softest hands
[1:26:56] where's your tough love now
[1:26:59] the angel with the softest hand elijah
[1:27:01] he's rugged he's burly he's wilderness
[1:27:04] man
[1:27:05] get the angel with the softest hands
[1:27:06] don't you scare him and walk over walk
[1:27:08] over and stroke his brow right easy
[1:27:12] and i want the best cook among you go up
[1:27:14] there
[1:27:15] and get all the vitamins you can find
[1:27:16] and put in his cornmeal the world's
[1:27:19] turned him down
[1:27:20] but i'm gonna treat him right
[1:27:24] he says bring forth the best that we got
[1:27:26] cook him a corn cake and set him down
[1:27:28] some water and this soft-handed angel
[1:27:31] went over and stroked the little servant
[1:27:33] of god on the brow
[1:27:35] remember if you've done your best god
[1:27:38] still got those angels in order
[1:27:41] he loves you just the same as he loved
[1:27:44] elijah and i thought that was so
[1:27:46] beautiful with the elijah type that
[1:27:48] god's love for his bride in this end
[1:27:51] time is the same love that he has for
[1:27:53] elijah and elijah went from this place
[1:27:55] later on in this chapter and where did
[1:27:57] he find god god said go before the
[1:27:58] mountain then i'll meet you there he
[1:28:00] wasn't in the wind he wasn't in the
[1:28:01] earthquake he wasn't in the fire he was
[1:28:03] in the still small voice why the angel
[1:28:06] with the softest hands not the loudest
[1:28:08] voice not the boldest flavors but that
[1:28:10] was nourishing him and ministered to him
[1:28:13] he had been conditioned to know what
[1:28:14] god's love was like and he could
[1:28:16] recognize him in the still small voice
[1:28:20] he loves you just the same as he loved
[1:28:22] elijah
[1:28:23] if you think that what i've been
[1:28:25] expressing through these nine services
[1:28:27] that i'm gonna give you you know 12
[1:28:29] rules to be able to defend yourself at
[1:28:30] thanksgiving and just give you rules to
[1:28:32] navigate difficult interpersonal
[1:28:34] relationships that would be the
[1:28:36] shallowest thing to express in these
[1:28:38] things is to get rid of all the barriers
[1:28:40] that are keeping us from open up every
[1:28:43] door to god and say i trust you
[1:28:45] completely here i am here's all of me
[1:28:50] and knowing that he's the one that we
[1:28:51] can trust when everybody else has let us
[1:28:54] down when everyone else who profess love
[1:28:56] and we ourselves who profess love and
[1:28:57] express it imperfectly and say that god
[1:29:00] i know that you love me and i can trust
[1:29:02] you
[1:29:03] it's a still small voice not something
[1:29:05] extravagant but perfectly sufficient
[1:29:11] he said i know
[1:29:12] he says he's expressed this love
[1:29:15] and what was it brother brahm said about
[1:29:17] job
[1:29:18] he knew that he loved god and god loved
[1:29:20] him
[1:29:21] so that's why he went through what he
[1:29:23] went through
[1:29:25] because he knew love had limits
[1:29:28] and that doesn't limit god it looses god
[1:29:32] god's not pushing us out in this
[1:29:34] you know behold i send you out in the
[1:29:36] midst of wolves good luck
[1:29:38] be wise as serpents harmless as doves
[1:29:41] what limits
[1:29:42] boundaries
[1:29:44] barriers
[1:29:45] it's the love of god to us i mentioned
[1:29:47] it in my prayer
[1:29:49] at the outset
[1:29:50] but with elijah when he's laying there
[1:29:53] paul despairing of life
[1:29:56] moses
[1:29:58] fearing the people
[1:30:01] elijah under the juniper tree suicidal
[1:30:08] even jesus
[1:30:11] despaired
[1:30:12] of life
[1:30:15] and
[1:30:16] you have this
[1:30:18] this moment
[1:30:21] we could say oh
[1:30:23] then what i'm seeing isn't the evidence
[1:30:26] of faith
[1:30:28] right
[1:30:30] we say where's faith now
[1:30:33] but it's not faith that's at issue
[1:30:36] it's love
[1:30:39] because the bible says that perfect love
[1:30:41] casteth out fear
[1:30:43] and that's not an indictment of our
[1:30:45] faith
[1:30:46] it's just in that moment when we are
[1:30:48] afraid what the bible say that when i am
[1:30:50] afraid i will trust in you
[1:30:53] and that moment when all hope is lost i
[1:30:56] will hope in you in that moment where
[1:30:58] i'm not sure where to turn and what to
[1:31:00] go through and though yes i have faith
[1:31:02] and yes i i believe in you but now i'm
[1:31:04] in a moment where i'm fearful i don't
[1:31:06] let the devil interpret the
[1:31:08] circumstances and that experience this
[1:31:11] listen fear is no evidence of anything
[1:31:14] faith alone is evidence if you have
[1:31:15] faith that's an evidence fear isn't
[1:31:17] inevitable we give too much weight to
[1:31:19] fear and we make fear the evidence of
[1:31:20] the lack of faith and the evidence of
[1:31:22] the of of having no faith but in the
[1:31:24] moment that we are afraid in the moment
[1:31:26] that we have fear it's then that god's
[1:31:29] perfect love can cast out fear
[1:31:33] and make us whole
[1:31:36] i want you in this moment now with your
[1:31:39] heads bowed
[1:31:40] taking it all letting it all accumulate
[1:31:42] together in your heart i have so much
[1:31:44] more that i would like to express on
[1:31:46] this subject but i feel that god has
[1:31:48] brought us to a point right now in our
[1:31:50] hearts
[1:31:51] to where we could we could take
[1:31:53] inventory of our lives
[1:31:55] and not in the sense that we would need
[1:31:57] to
[1:31:58] uh beat ourselves
[1:32:01] and make ourselves feel guilty and make
[1:32:03] ourselves feel
[1:32:05] uh
[1:32:06] sinful and unworthy
[1:32:09] but let the love of god
[1:32:13] be expressed to us to see
[1:32:15] the true value of ourselves
[1:32:18] in his eyes
[1:32:21] to recognize
[1:32:22] that he loves you just the
[1:32:24] same as he loved elijah
[1:32:30] and in the moment when we're looking
[1:32:32] around and expecting god to beat us and
[1:32:34] to chastise us and to rebuke us
[1:32:38] maybe you've been looking for the angel
[1:32:39] with the hardest backhand
[1:32:43] you've been looking for a god with the
[1:32:44] sword
[1:32:45] you've been looking for a a judgment a
[1:32:48] harshness a cruelty
[1:32:50] and god's wanting you to relent
[1:32:53] to the softest hands this may not be for
[1:32:55] everybody there may be some moses here
[1:32:57] today that just need to speak and go
[1:32:58] forward
[1:32:59] and i say with everything that's in me
[1:33:01] child of god speak and go forward
[1:33:04] but if you find yourself in your life
[1:33:06] under a juniper tree i say submit
[1:33:07] yourself to the soft hands of jehovah
[1:33:11] accept his forgiveness
[1:33:13] open up your heart to him
[1:33:16] i challenge anyone here now i admonish
[1:33:19] you i compel you as paul would even
[1:33:21] speak to those children and say i'm i'm
[1:33:23] now
[1:33:24] i'm directing you i'm asking you that
[1:33:26] you would
[1:33:28] act
[1:33:32] then i encourage you now to respond
[1:33:36] to his love today
[1:33:39] you know how he spoke to you
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:44] you know what's in your heart
[1:33:49] with our heads bowed
[1:33:55] you're not on camera people aren't
[1:33:56] looking around
[1:33:58] but in sincerity today i'll just even
[1:34:01] bound my head
[1:34:02] in sincerity today
[1:34:07] if you want to know that love and feel
[1:34:09] that love
[1:34:11] if you need the healing that only his
[1:34:12] word can bring
[1:34:16] if you need the courage that elijah
[1:34:18] received to go in the strength of meat
[1:34:21] under the mount
[1:34:22] form
[1:34:24] i invite you to stand
[1:34:27] and say it's me today lord
[1:34:32] it's me today
[1:34:35] yielding to your love
[1:34:38] you say i relent lord i've resisted i've
[1:34:41] resisted i've
[1:34:43] strived and i've pushed
[1:34:46] and i've kicked against but today lord
[1:34:50] i give up
[1:34:53] i'm not running from you anymore
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:35:02] i'm gonna give in lord
[1:35:10] heavenly father
[1:35:15] i'm done with my own devices
[1:35:21] i'm done with my own coping mechanisms
[1:35:26] done with the cycles
[1:35:30] i'm done with the excuses
[1:35:33] i'm done using barriers
[1:35:38] give up lord
[1:35:40] i'm all yours
[1:35:44] i'm all yours lord
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:48] take me lord
[1:35:50] here i am
[1:35:52] i'm not afraid anymore
[1:35:56] i'm not afraid of where this word's
[1:35:58] going to take me
[1:36:00] i'm not afraid of the change in my
[1:36:01] theology i'm not afraid
[1:36:04] of the change in my circumstances i
[1:36:06] trust you lord
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:13] and i realized father that i have
[1:36:15] gone through paces in my life and i've
[1:36:18] experienced things that create the wrong
[1:36:20] image of love and create scars and
[1:36:23] complexes and negative tendencies i see
[1:36:26] them expressed in my relationship with
[1:36:28] my wife i see it expressed in the
[1:36:30] interactions with my children
[1:36:33] but lord i recognize today that what it
[1:36:35] has done is it's brought a contrast for
[1:36:37] me
[1:36:39] of what love is and what it does and
[1:36:42] what love isn't and what it doesn't
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:45] and i love you lord
[1:36:48] i love your love for me
[1:36:50] it's so pure it's so clean it's so right
[1:36:55] and i don't want to be afraid of anymore
[1:36:57] i don't want to
[1:36:58] i don't want to feel like i've got to do
[1:37:00] the protecting that i've got to do the
[1:37:01] healing that i've got to do the striving
[1:37:05] but take take my hand lord and lead me
[1:37:09] and guide me
[1:37:12] and give me the meat lord that i need in
[1:37:14] this moment that
[1:37:16] oh you're such a good cook lord why
[1:37:19] would i be afraid of what you want to
[1:37:20] feed me
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:23] lord if i'm going to lodge under a
[1:37:25] juniper tree today then i
[1:37:27] i welcome the soft hands i won't shrink
[1:37:30] back i won't run and hide further out of
[1:37:33] reach into a cave or a juniper tree but
[1:37:35] i'll say lord i
[1:37:37] i need you every hour
[1:37:41] but if i'm a moses that's standing in
[1:37:43] the middle of an exodus that's had
[1:37:44] enough vindication
[1:37:46] enough turns enough cycles
[1:37:50] enough vindication
[1:37:52] to speak and go forward and let me not
[1:37:55] be a coward lord
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:38:01] we can look at the word of god and
[1:38:03] sometimes take it to be very hard even
[1:38:06] your response to moses why christ thou
[1:38:09] unto me speak bow to the children that
[1:38:12] they would go forward
[1:38:16] and we could think that that's really
[1:38:17] hard but the principle of why christ
[1:38:20] speak lord is you know me
[1:38:22] you know me
[1:38:24] you know what i need lord
[1:38:26] you know what's best
[1:38:28] so i'll trust you lord
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:32] and i
[1:38:33] i'm thankful that you
[1:38:36] will not allow me to endure
[1:38:41] without providing a way of escape a
[1:38:43] power to bear up against it you will
[1:38:44] place upon me no greater burden you will
[1:38:46] not
[1:38:48] burden me beyond what is necessary for
[1:38:50] this moment in this time
[1:38:53] bless your people all those that stood
[1:38:54] lord
[1:38:56] even now i just would invite everyone to
[1:38:58] stand together
[1:39:00] if you were not already standing we just
[1:39:02] unite together standing now and lord we
[1:39:05] pray
[1:39:06] that you
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:10] so fill us with your love
[1:39:12] that's being projected into our souls
[1:39:14] that we too can project
[1:39:16] divine love
[1:39:18] bless your people today may there be
[1:39:20] real healing that transpires
[1:39:22] i pray lord now
[1:39:24] that not only would there be a healing
[1:39:26] of the hearts and minds of your people
[1:39:29] but that it would be manifested in the
[1:39:30] healing of the body
[1:39:32] that has been brought low by these
[1:39:33] things
[1:39:34] and likewise lord may it give life
[1:39:37] power to this body this church
[1:39:40] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:46] [Music]
