[0:00] as you could tell from this scripture
[0:02] slide that we're going to continue on
[0:04] the subject of the house of the Lord and
[0:08] I trust that there's some continuity to
[0:09] these different subjects that we've been
[0:11] covering and the way that we've
[0:12] approached them I was getting some
[0:14] feedback here recently Somebody went
[0:15] back and listen to kind of a subsection
[0:17] of services uh in this and they found
[0:20] just uh you know continuity and the the
[0:22] way that they work just in principles
[0:24] and themselves but I hope it's painting
[0:26] a picture we have some other subjects
[0:28] we're hoping to get to here soon
[0:30] but I want to wrap up what's been maybe
[0:32] I think it's a six parts on Liberty and
[0:35] in looking at Liberty been taking that
[0:37] scripture where the spirit of the Lord
[0:38] is there's liberty and kind of what led
[0:40] me there was the Simplicity that is in
[0:42] Christ and this Liberty is often
[0:45] misunderstood and so tonight we're
[0:47] preaching on patient Liberty and brother
[0:49] Scott told me he was really excited uh
[0:51] for the service that we're speaking on
[0:53] uh patient autonomy or patient Liberty
[0:56] and I was like I think you got the wrong
[0:57] patient uh and so uh but I appreciated
[1:01] the humor but we're preaching on patient
[1:03] Liberty and I felt to put this and I'm
[1:06] realizing now we don't have the proper
[1:07] fonting in our slideshow computer but I
[1:11] was usually I used our church logo and
[1:14] so that's not the right font and I feel
[1:15] like I should just start all over
[1:16] anybody got a song special I can go fix
[1:18] this real quick but in the uh our church
[1:22] logo Arizona Believers Church and then
[1:23] the whatever tag we want to use at the
[1:25] bottom it's I'm used I used a similar
[1:27] format to say patient Liberty because
[1:30] I'm hoping that that's what we can have
[1:32] as a church I wanted just to kind of
[1:34] identify this with us as a church in
[1:36] looking at this subject of patient
[1:38] Liberty I I'm going to be using a very
[1:41] specific theme that fits with the
[1:43] impatient Liberty and the imperfect
[1:44] Liberty that we've already examined and
[1:48] in uh it kind of the theme has it's
[1:51] related maybe to more a spiritual
[1:53] operation of gifts and maybe church
[1:54] services the way brother brandham
[1:56] addressed a lot of fanaticism and
[1:58] disorder in those ways I I want to
[2:00] continue in that line but I'm I'm using
[2:03] those things just as an example of
[2:06] impatience and the importance of
[2:08] patience and I think that we can apply
[2:10] these principles to everyday life
[2:12] especially in a time where it just seems
[2:14] to be it's easier to get Edge on edge
[2:16] where we can be a little bit edgy or uh
[2:18] maybe getting agitated impatient and one
[2:22] thing that keeps recurring to me in my
[2:23] mind as I've studied on these things
[2:25] this week is just how we can get
[2:26] emotionally worked up about things
[2:28] something happens and we become
[2:30] emotionally invested in and we get
[2:31] worked up somebody says something
[2:33] somebody does something and things are
[2:35] happening around us maybe real genuine
[2:37] offenses or uh boundary violations
[2:40] however you want to look at it and we
[2:42] get emotionally worked up and it's in
[2:44] those moments that we need to kind of
[2:45] tap into something very very important
[2:47] and that's just waiting on the Lord
[2:49] being at rest and trusting him in not
[2:52] pressing in not uh uh trying to address
[2:56] something and end doing it we're just
[2:57] confronting it and we're making it worse
[2:59] so I think there's just a lot lot of
[3:00] ways that this can apply and apply to
[3:03] your heart as an individual to our homes
[3:05] as families and to this church now I'm
[3:08] going to continue a little bit on
[3:10] impatient Liberty I want to say some
[3:11] things just to reset that and then as we
[3:13] go forward I will be covering uh some
[3:16] things that we administered on a couple
[3:18] weeks ago on impatient Liberty but I'll
[3:20] just weave it into tonight's subject but
[3:23] with this impatient Liberty I wanted to
[3:25] use this idea of a Restless desire for
[3:27] change or this Restless desire for
[3:29] excitement and it's kind of this
[3:31] Restless desire for change or excitement
[3:33] that leads into air leads into US acting
[3:36] out of order doing something that's not
[3:38] right with God's word we've looked at
[3:40] the Temptation in the garden the
[3:42] Temptation in the wilderness and we
[3:43] could look in general in our lives that
[3:45] when we are tempted uh Satan's
[3:47] Temptations are aimed at producing this
[3:50] restlessness this Restless longing this
[3:53] anxious desire that we feel that we need
[3:55] to act we need to do something and so
[3:57] it's kind of at the core of how Satan
[3:59] was deal with Jesus he was causing him
[4:01] to tempt God to act impatiently and take
[4:04] things sooner and out of order and even
[4:06] with the woman we saw that a Eve's
[4:09] impatience birthed an ill-tempered
[4:11] selfish emotional son uh and it was not
[4:14] the proper son saw the same thing with
[4:16] Sarah her impatience brought ishmail a
[4:18] wild man a one that caused conflict and
[4:22] persecution one that was very
[4:24] erasable but in Hebrews chap 6: 13 14
[4:28] and 15 says for when God made promise to
[4:31] Abraham because he could swear by no
[4:33] greater he swear by himself saying
[4:36] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[4:38] multiply and I'll multiply thee and so
[4:41] after he had patiently endured he
[4:44] obtained the promise now we're we're
[4:46] deep into our subject tonight after he
[4:48] patiently endured he obtained the
[4:50] promise God swore by himself when he
[4:53] said that I Will Bless thee and I will
[4:55] multiply thee he could not swear swear
[4:57] by anyone greater so the promise was
[5:00] sure God swearing by it but it says
[5:02] after Abraham had patiently endured he
[5:05] obtained the promise this is if I can
[5:08] say this is the Simplicity in Christ
[5:10] just believe just rest just wait just
[5:13] trust him he swore by himself it's an
[5:15] unconditional Covenant nothing that we
[5:17] have to do except receive it and so
[5:20] Abraham as the father of our faith isn't
[5:22] the father of trying to make it happen
[5:24] and acting out of fear and and and
[5:27] taking the wife's Alternatives his his
[5:29] faith alone was to patiently endure and
[5:33] through that patient endurance he
[5:35] obtained the promise notice how at the
[5:38] core of Abraham receiving the promise
[5:40] was patience uh you may recall and I
[5:42] know all of you do with perfect recall
[5:44] the sermon we preached uh I think he was
[5:46] in the series on wonder lust and wonder
[5:48] loss on the death of patience and it
[5:51] made Brother Scott very fearful and I
[5:54] was like no it's a different kind of
[5:55] patient and so then the death of
[5:58] patience we looked at how that patient
[5:59] patience will lead us to the Fulfillment
[6:01] of the promise and how that patience is
[6:03] an essential attribute of God and
[6:05] therefore it's an essential attribute
[6:06] for his children but how that in the
[6:09] death of patients and the way things are
[6:10] designed in this day and age and the
[6:12] cycles of U the dopamine uh loops and
[6:16] those things we're always looking to be
[6:17] sensitized that we're we've been made to
[6:19] be constantly impatient and we're
[6:22] Restless to experience a thrill rest to
[6:24] experience and emotion and I would
[6:26] venture to say that many of us are
[6:28] unable to just sit on our couch for very
[6:31] long without wanting to reach for a
[6:33] device or reach for something to start
[6:35] that that that dopamine release and so
[6:37] we've become impatient to be impatient
[6:40] you're Restless under existence existing
[6:42] conditions like the way they are you
[6:44] want them to change you're not happy
[6:46] with just sitting there being bored and
[6:47] there's a uh you cannot bear any longer
[6:50] in your current state but what Abraham
[6:52] did is he patiently endured he was
[6:55] willing to as long as necessary remain
[6:58] in his
[7:00] believing that God made the promise no
[7:02] matter what that state would be he
[7:04] wanted just to remain in that state in
[7:07] order to receive the promise so this
[7:10] patient uh we're talking about patient
[7:12] Liberty tonight and and just looking
[7:15] again at this idea of how critical
[7:16] patience is in Revelations chap
[7:20] 13:1 I'm kind of skipping over you know
[7:23] burying the lead a little bit here and
[7:25] skipping over the real heaviness to this
[7:27] but it says he that leadth into
[7:28] captivity cap capity shall go into
[7:30] captivity he that kth with the sword
[7:32] must be killed with the sword there's a
[7:34] lot going on in Revelations 13 but then
[7:36] it says here is the patience and the
[7:38] faith of the Saints out looking at those
[7:41] two together it's saying the patience
[7:44] and the faith of the saints that faith
[7:46] is that we can say whether it be our
[7:48] ability to believe our capacity that
[7:50] gift to believe the things of God but
[7:52] then it's not just the faith but then
[7:54] the patience The Virtue to be able to
[7:57] endure unto it so faith is the evidence
[8:00] faith is a substance and we have it and
[8:03] the faith of the Saints is that the
[8:05] promise will be fulfilled and patience
[8:08] is what we have to see it happen so
[8:11] patience is very important in Hebrews
[8:13] chapter 6:12 he's writing that you be
[8:16] not slothful but followers of them who
[8:18] through faith and patience inherit the
[8:21] promises this patience has to do with
[8:24] government of our emotions uh keeping
[8:27] into check certain instincts and
[8:29] functions of the Flesh and desires and
[8:32] to where we want to be quick to satisfy
[8:33] our desire for something but he's saying
[8:35] we shouldn't be slothful but followers
[8:37] of those who faith and
[8:39] patience notice how that Faith must be
[8:42] joined with patience in order for the
[8:44] word to be fully expressed can have
[8:46] faith but it's got to be joined with
[8:48] patience in order for it to come to its
[8:50] fullness with faith can see it faith can
[8:53] feel it Faith Can Know It faith can be
[8:54] the substance and the evidence but for
[8:56] it to actually become
[8:58] materialized and the F promise fulfilled
[9:01] it requires patience so this idea of
[9:04] patience it's it's keeping in check
[9:05] emotions it's not just being L astray by
[9:08] our flesh and our excitement and our our
[9:10] need for certain things we're just
[9:11] willing to wait on the Lord Revelations
[9:15] 3:10 I believe we did use this a couple
[9:17] weeks ago because thou Hast kept the
[9:19] word of my patience I also will keep
[9:22] thee from the hour of Temptation which
[9:24] shall come upon all the world to try
[9:26] them that dwell upon the Earth notice
[9:28] how key keeping his word of patience the
[9:32] word of his patience gives us power in
[9:35] the hour of Temptation so faith and
[9:37] patience will keep you in the hour of
[9:39] Temptation they say well I have faith to
[9:41] believe but if you don't have patience
[9:42] and there's a certain wearing down there
[9:45] there's a certain War of Attrition
[9:46] you're going to engage in and you may
[9:48] still have faith but your faith will
[9:50] only go so far there's a point at which
[9:51] you've got to completely anch yourself
[9:53] in his faith and so there's this battle
[9:55] in our minds this war of attrition that
[9:57] if we don't have faith together with
[9:59] patience if we don't have this virtue of
[10:02] patience that can come in this hour and
[10:04] keep the word of my patience he will
[10:06] keep us in the hour of Temptation if we
[10:08] don't have patience temptation is easier
[10:10] to yield
[10:11] to you remember temptation is at the
[10:13] heart of these several services on
[10:15] Liberty and the Temptation Of Christ and
[10:18] how that he was offered he was wanting
[10:20] him to do something extravagant and
[10:22] something Visual and something uh uh and
[10:25] Jesus even brother brand equated it to
[10:27] snake handling and drinking poison says
[10:29] Don't Tempt God so there's this
[10:31] temptation to
[10:33] tempt in the Philadelphian Church age
[10:36] chapter age of the church age book
[10:37] brother brandham writes to wait for the
[10:39] Fulfillment of that word required
[10:41] patience even as it did in the case of
[10:43] Abraham and this is commentary on
[10:44] Revelations
[10:46] 3:10 he endured and seing him who is
[10:48] invisible he was patient and then the
[10:50] word was finally fulfilled this is the
[10:53] way God teaches his people
[10:55] patience why why does he teach his
[10:58] patience if he fulfilled his word in
[11:00] physical manifestations the very instant
[11:02] you prayed you would never learn
[11:04] patience but would become even more
[11:07] impatient with
[11:09] life anybody ever had a spoiled child or
[11:12] know we all know of a spoiled child I'm
[11:14] sure right we could just start naming
[11:16] off nieces and nephews and cousins uh
[11:19] but never our
[11:21] own but there's there's a what spoils
[11:24] them is when they get what they want
[11:25] immediately then they expect it
[11:27] immediately and if it doesn't come
[11:29] immediately they feel that something's
[11:30] wrong or you know the the the the Rhythm
[11:33] in life has been interrupted and things
[11:35] are going to be completely fall apart
[11:37] and God knows better than anybody the
[11:40] human nature and how we we're learning
[11:42] character and we're growing and how that
[11:45] he allows a certain rhythm of
[11:46] fulfillment of his word and even How He
[11:49] blesses us and then sometimes we don't
[11:51] feel like we're being blessed and it's
[11:52] all for the purpose of growing us into
[11:55] that mature character in love with
[11:57] Christ to where it's like he knows that
[11:59] we get
[12:00] him right to know him as he knows us he
[12:03] knows he can see in the way that we live
[12:05] the way that we act the way that we
[12:06] respond and that we are securing his
[12:09] love for us that we get him we know his
[12:11] promises we know they're true we know
[12:12] the how he works we understand if he's
[12:14] allowing something to happen we're like
[12:16] ah I really thought I wanted that but
[12:19] God must have something better right you
[12:22] you you realize that he's re recognizing
[12:25] okay this person gets it and so if we
[12:28] did if we go always gave us physical
[12:32] manifestations every time then we would
[12:34] never learn patience said we would
[12:36] become even more impatient with
[12:39] life that's not that we would become
[12:41] impatient with God said God I prayed for
[12:43] that you gave it to me immediately now
[12:44] I'm praying it's not happen he said just
[12:45] in life we become more impatient we'
[12:48] become more impatient with each other we
[12:50] become more impatient with things and we
[12:52] become just impatient uh Restless people
[12:56] there's the wisdom of God so it writes
[12:58] Paul writes in Hebrews 10:36 for ye have
[13:02] need of patience that after you've done
[13:04] the will of God you might receive the
[13:07] promise there's your patience again that
[13:09] enduring that persevering that
[13:11] sustaining and that uh to preserve
[13:14] something to hold on to it you have need
[13:17] of patience that after you've done the
[13:18] will of God you might receive the
[13:21] promise Revelations 2:19 he says I Know
[13:24] Thy works and charity and service and
[13:26] faith and thy patience in thy Work works
[13:29] and the last to be more than the first
[13:32] when God is giving this recitation of
[13:34] what he's seen your Works your charity
[13:35] your service faith and thy patience
[13:38] brother bandam teaches us in the church
[13:39] age book that faithfulness and patience
[13:41] go together he says in fact patience is
[13:44] the outcome of
[13:45] faithfulness if you have real Faith
[13:48] patience is the result of it patience he
[13:51] says that fa patience is the outcome of
[13:55] faithfulness it seems sometimes that
[13:57] we've confused real faith
[13:59] for being that overt aggressive pushy
[14:04] demeanor right man that person who's
[14:06] just pushing they're the ones with real
[14:08] faith when the person the person with
[14:10] real faith is the one that's just kind
[14:11] of sitting back Waiting for God to do it
[14:14] it's kind of kind of like the guy who
[14:15] doesn't talk a lot he's just real quiet
[14:17] when things start getting built up we
[14:19] mentioned it before we've all
[14:20] experienced it where people are talking
[14:22] trash and they're pushing and they're
[14:24] yelling and there's a guy over there
[14:25] saying I don't want any problems he's
[14:26] the one trying to get away from cuz he's
[14:28] the one that knows he can whip everybody
[14:30] in the room so he doesn't have to prove
[14:32] anything but it's the guy over there
[14:34] kicking off his flipflops and ripping
[14:36] his shirt off who screaming and yelling
[14:37] that's the guy that's going to end up
[14:38] with a bloody nose CU he's asking for it
[14:41] and he can't back up what he's talking
[14:43] but the guy who could just sit back and
[14:45] wait he's not trying to cover anything
[14:47] up I sometimes have to go in those
[14:49] realms for certain people who live there
[14:51] for so long that's the only way that
[14:52] they can relate to certain
[14:54] things people are wondering who's he
[14:56] talking about well let me just
[15:01] but there's a a patience that we need
[15:04] you have faith and patience he says
[15:05] patience is the outcome of faithfulness
[15:08] he writes there is absolutely no other
[15:09] way in which to gain patience it has to
[15:11] come by the trial of our faith so for if
[15:15] if our faith isn't tried there is no
[15:16] patience as it says in James 1:3 knowing
[15:18] this that the trying of your faith
[15:19] worketh patience so faith is it's faith
[15:23] is the seeds or it's the foundation it's
[15:25] the Genesis of patience and once faith
[15:27] can be married with patience the the
[15:29] outcome is
[15:31] certain with no intervening detours or
[15:35] mistakes because you'll just wait on the
[15:37] Fulfillment of God's promised
[15:39] word adding to that Faith patience in
[15:43] second Peter chapter 1 verses 3 to9 I'd
[15:46] like to read this uh these several
[15:49] verses a as an effort of just getting us
[15:53] to consider the full stature of a
[15:54] perfect man and how all these things are
[15:57] working together especially with some
[15:59] statements one particular statement we
[16:01] read before and some other statements
[16:03] we'd like to read
[16:04] tonight Peter writes according as his
[16:06] divine power hath given unto us all
[16:08] things that pertaineth unto life and
[16:10] godliness through the knowledge of him
[16:12] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[16:15] there's this beautiful Cemetery with
[16:16] Ephesians 1 where this is to those who
[16:18] are in Christ this is to those who have
[16:22] been born again who have his Spirit we
[16:24] have been given divine power he's given
[16:25] us all things that pertain to life and
[16:27] godliness through the knowledge of him
[16:28] that called us to glory and virtue so he
[16:30] says whereby are given unto us exceeding
[16:33] great and precious promises that by
[16:35] these you might be partakers of divine
[16:38] nature having escaped the corruption
[16:40] that is in the world through lust now we
[16:42] realize the world that is the corruption
[16:44] that is in the world through lust goes
[16:45] back to the original sin and how that
[16:48] Satan worked on the woman causing this
[16:50] impatience and she acted out of turn and
[16:52] out of season and engaged in an activity
[16:55] that brought death upon All Mankind and
[16:57] thrust them out of the garden now we all
[16:58] come into this world uh into corruption
[17:02] but by the new birth we've escaped
[17:04] corruption that is in the world through
[17:06] that original sin and so this all he's
[17:08] speaking to people who've been born
[17:10] again and he says and beside this giving
[17:11] all diligence there's some kind of
[17:15] persistence add to your faith
[17:17] virtue and to your virtue knowledge and
[17:20] to knowledge Temperance and to
[17:21] Temperance patience and to patience
[17:24] godliness there's these things that are
[17:25] just working together into godliness
[17:27] brotherly kindness into brotherly
[17:28] kindness charity for if these things be
[17:31] in you and abound the abounding comes
[17:34] through the addition if you add to your
[17:37] faith virtue you have abounded your
[17:39] faith when you add to your virtue
[17:41] knowledge you've abounded that when
[17:43] these things begin to marry and join
[17:45] together and coal house there's there's
[17:47] an abounding for these things be in you
[17:48] and abound they make you that you shall
[17:50] neither be bare nor UNR fruitful in the
[17:52] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[17:54] he that lacketh these
[17:56] things is blind
[17:59] and cannot see a far off and hath
[18:00] forgotten that he was purged from his
[18:03] old sins there are those who are the
[18:05] forgetful hearers those that do not do
[18:08] those who uh cherry-pick or see it their
[18:11] own way he says those who lack these
[18:12] things are blind and cannot see a far
[18:15] off and have actually forgotten what
[18:17] nature they were of before brother
[18:19] Brenham writes in the chapter age of
[18:21] chapter 8 of the church age book God
[18:22] gives us exceeding in great precious
[18:25] promises exceeding great in Precious
[18:27] promises you see this
[18:29] fit in with second Peter there said he
[18:31] has promised to fulfill them he will but
[18:35] from the time we pray into the time we
[18:37] get the answer we must learn to receive
[18:39] patience into our souls for only in
[18:41] patience do we possess life only in
[18:44] patience do we possess life may God help
[18:46] us to learn this lesson even as we know
[18:48] the people of the sixth age learned
[18:50] patients we read the history of the
[18:52] lives of these great
[18:54] Christians and what a contrast we see
[18:56] between their lives and Ours for they
[18:59] were so patient and
[19:00] quiet and today we are all but overcome
[19:03] and over impatience and
[19:05] haste if somebody had a real reason
[19:07] maybe just to kind of lose it maybe they
[19:09] did in the sixth Church age and here we
[19:12] are with all of our luxuries and
[19:13] fineries and everything that we have and
[19:16] you know it's when when the air
[19:17] conditioner doesn't get below 72 we're
[19:19] over there checking it with the radar
[19:21] gun and like man this thing won't blow
[19:22] cold air and it's like well it's 67
[19:24] that's not bad it used to blow 63 and
[19:27] and we're getting oh should we should we
[19:28] go out of town should we get a hotel
[19:30] what should we do should we call Brother
[19:31] David we're just all panicking and
[19:34] meanwhile people in other ages are
[19:35] losing their lives right and they're
[19:38] just kind of like hey if this is what
[19:40] God has for me 78 degrees in my living
[19:43] room then I'll take it whatever he has
[19:47] they were patient and quiet and today
[19:49] we're all but overcome in over
[19:51] impatience and haste and ain't nothing
[19:54] but the truth it's what we're living in
[19:57] it's the time we're living in brother
[19:59] Bram is saying that if God is going to
[20:02] fulfill his word it requires patience if
[20:05] he gave it to you sooner than he ought
[20:07] to it would seow seeds of impatience we
[20:10] would become even more impatient with
[20:12] life we would never lve patience we
[20:14] wouldn't have this critical virtue that
[20:15] holds things together that's part of our
[20:17] abounding in Christ that it's what
[20:20] strengthens our relationships in our
[20:22] relationships to one another whether it
[20:24] be as Pastor to congregation or
[20:25] congregation to Pastor husband to wife
[20:27] parents to children children to parents
[20:28] brother to sister in a church and family
[20:30] relationships uncles to nieces whatever
[20:32] it is there's two no greater attributes
[20:34] we could have for one another than grace
[20:36] and
[20:37] patience and where those two things are
[20:39] lacking it's going to be Strife it's
[20:41] going to be quit time it's going to be
[20:42] it's going to be war and so we need
[20:45] these if we're going to see uh promises
[20:47] fulfilled and potential
[20:49] fulfilled so we' read already in
[20:51] reference in James chap 1: 2 3 and 4 my
[20:55] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[20:57] into many diverse
[20:59] Temptations knowing this that the Trine
[21:02] of your faith worketh patience there's
[21:04] simply this patience is this product
[21:07] there's no other way in which to gain
[21:08] patience except that your faith be tried
[21:12] but then notice this product of patience
[21:14] but let patience have her perfect work
[21:16] there's this
[21:17] handoff Faith secures it and possesses
[21:19] it it trusts it to patience and patience
[21:22] says give me a moment or two or three or
[21:25] four hold tight but let me do my perfect
[21:27] work that may be perfect and entire
[21:30] wanting nothing anxious for nothing
[21:34] Restless for nothing let patience have
[21:36] her perfect work this to me is just at
[21:38] the heart and the core of the importance
[21:41] of patience and how the death of
[21:43] patience is the ruin of us all is it
[21:45] robs us of our trust in Christ Our Rest
[21:48] In Christ and really what's the point in
[21:49] being a
[21:50] Christian right like if we can't just
[21:53] trust God if we don't just aren't just
[21:55] happy with what he's done for us and we
[21:56] let everything else agitate us and C us
[21:58] to act out of his character then what's
[22:00] the real benefit of the Cross what what
[22:02] has his blood done for us what where is
[22:05] his love pain dividends in my personal
[22:07] life and in my relationship with others
[22:09] if I'm not letting patience have her
[22:11] perfect
[22:13] work now as we've read from second Peter
[22:16] chapter
[22:17] 1 notice what brother brandham says here
[22:21] in the Statue of a perfect man when he
[22:23] looks at this adding to your faith
[22:25] patience he says if you've got faith it
[22:27] worketh patience
[22:30] the Bible said so this is patience and
[22:33] that focus with me I have um I have a
[22:37] lengthy statement from where I think
[22:38] Pentecost failed I'd like to I'm going
[22:40] to try to finish on that it's a very
[22:42] long statement I want to read through it
[22:44] I just felt like I had to keep intact so
[22:45] we're getting very close to that now I
[22:47] want you just to very Focus intently on
[22:50] what brother bam is saying now that's
[22:52] the next thing is going to build this
[22:54] stature you know God has got real
[22:56] material in his building see how short
[22:58] we are brother sister and I read that
[23:01] I'm like come on brother Brown's making
[23:02] short jokes like I can't avoid it he
[23:05] says see how short we are brother sister
[23:07] see where we're at we have Glory have
[23:09] shouts and things because we've got
[23:11] faith but when we come down to these
[23:13] things here God can't build us into that
[23:16] stature so there's this maturing there's
[23:18] this growing he says we have these
[23:20] things because Faith but we we're trying
[23:23] to come into an image we're trying to
[23:25] grow and mature and he says he can't
[23:27] build this stature says he can't he
[23:29] can't make us up that kind of place we
[23:32] got all these other things we fall slide
[23:34] off with it we can't build his church he
[23:36] can't build his church patience with
[23:38] what what kind of patience first thing
[23:40] is have patience with god notice this
[23:43] statement how profound it is if you've
[23:45] got real genuine faith you'll have real
[23:47] genuine patience because Faith worketh
[23:49] patience if you have real genuine faith
[23:52] you'll have real genuine patience maybe
[23:55] the way some people act is not not
[23:58] because they have faith but because they
[24:01] lack
[24:02] faith and some people sit back as
[24:04] Spectators thinking I must not have
[24:06] faith because I'm not as
[24:07] demonstrative I'm not as loud I'm not as
[24:10] vocal I'm not as active I'm not as
[24:13] aggressive I'm not as showy I'm not
[24:15] doing all these other things maybe I
[24:17] don't have
[24:19] faith but he's saying if you have real
[24:21] genuine faith you'll have
[24:22] patience because Faith worketh patience
[24:25] that trying of your faith When God says
[24:26] anything you believe it notice what this
[24:28] anchors in his word that's all you got
[24:30] patience say well I asked him last night
[24:32] to heal me and I'm just as sick this
[24:34] morning oh my what patience God told
[24:36] Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't
[24:38] even one sign he was still believing he
[24:42] was patient with God here's the secret
[24:45] put him always before you let him be the
[24:48] next Crossing thing you can't cross him
[24:51] so just keep him before you he said so
[24:54] and it's going to happen keep him before
[24:57] you amen
[24:59] that's what you do did he make the
[25:00] promise keep it before you don't lose
[25:03] sight of the promise make that keep that
[25:05] before you it's when we take our eyes
[25:06] off the promise he said it would happen
[25:08] and instead of just trusting him like
[25:10] well maybe if I did this and maybe if I
[25:12] did that and maybe if I did this and
[25:13] maybe I did that and it's not Faith
[25:16] anymore it's you trying to make it work
[25:17] that
[25:20] workup the statue of a perfect man it's
[25:22] this maturing it's this growing it's a
[25:25] process of character development in our
[25:27] text we we read from Ephesians 1:
[25:30] 3-6 brother benam uses this in his text
[25:33] and what where I think Pentecost
[25:35] failed if you're familiar with the
[25:37] sermon whether you've listened to it
[25:39] recently or it kind of stuck in your
[25:40] minds or if you'd like to go listen to
[25:42] it or read it uh here in the future he's
[25:45] preaching in some ways his teaching on
[25:47] adoption which I believe was very clear
[25:50] that your adoption is not your birth
[25:53] that when you're born again you receive
[25:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[25:56] Holy Ghost is an inside teacher to bring
[25:58] you to a place of maturity to place you
[26:01] and if there is
[26:03] some uh intangible aspects to that I
[26:06] think that remains it remains that way
[26:08] for each person to individually grow
[26:11] into who God's called them to be into
[26:13] your particular calling in placing so it
[26:16] says this in Ephesians chapter 1
[26:18] starting with verse three blessed be the
[26:19] God and the father of our Lord Jesus
[26:21] Christ who have blessed us with all
[26:22] spiritual blessings and Heavenly places
[26:24] in Christ this is to the born- again
[26:26] believer those who have the Holy Ghost
[26:28] according as Heath chosen Us in him
[26:30] before the foundation of the world that
[26:31] we should be holy and Without Blame
[26:33] before him in love having predestinated
[26:37] us unto the adoption of children by
[26:39] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[26:42] good pleasure of his will this isn't so
[26:44] much our election to New Life this isn't
[26:46] the seed germ inside of us being brought
[26:48] to life through a quickening of the Holy
[26:50] Spirit but it is that life now growing
[26:53] and possessing this vessel and maturing
[26:56] it's these things being in you and
[26:57] abounding it's adding to Faith virtue
[26:59] and placing all these things to where
[27:01] Christ is being manifested in our flesh
[27:04] as we mature and grow up into him who is
[27:06] the
[27:07] head having predestined us unto adoption
[27:11] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[27:13] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[27:15] Beloved this is a scripture that
[27:18] specifically uh brother vam used when
[27:20] preaching the hear ye hymns and
[27:22] blasphemous names and other things he
[27:23] took this concept and this idea also
[27:25] from Galatians of what adoption is now
[27:28] we've never taken it just as a subject
[27:30] in itself I think it's certainly worthy
[27:31] of a decade of teaching uh it's been
[27:34] worthy of you know nearly three decades
[27:35] of study for me but it's a very
[27:37] important subject and we've touched on
[27:40] it in different places and once again
[27:41] we'll just kind of throw it in there in
[27:43] this particular part of the sermon of
[27:45] what brother brandham taught on adoption
[27:48] what he taught on adoption is that
[27:49] you're born again by the Holy Ghost and
[27:50] then there's this growing into this
[27:52] place of trust to where your name on the
[27:54] check is just as good as your daddy's
[27:56] does it take anything away from a born
[27:58] son or a daughter of God because they
[27:59] have access to the same power the same
[28:01] Capital by The Authority that's given
[28:03] them as a son but this growing into
[28:05] maturity is when power becomes fully
[28:08] vested in the sun to sign the check
[28:10] himself and now he has power not just a
[28:13] policeman with the badge but now he's
[28:14] come to a place where I am you and you
[28:16] are me there's this Oneness there's this
[28:18] maturity it's where the father says you
[28:20] know whatever he says goes brother mam
[28:23] went to Great Links to bring this law of
[28:25] adoption out of the Old Testament he
[28:26] went to Great Links to show it in the
[28:27] life of Jesus Jesus Christ so it is
[28:29] something that I believe is
[28:33] important but yet the devil likes to
[28:36] mess with it and I'll say this messing
[28:40] with it will eventually cause
[28:43] problems in the moment it might make a
[28:45] lot of sense well why does he say this
[28:47] when this and he says this here and in
[28:49] the moment it it might you might feel
[28:52] the need to Tinker with it a little bit
[28:53] especially when people use it as an
[28:55] excuse well I cheated on my wife because
[28:56] I'm not adopted okay well let's just
[28:58] change everything brother B taught on
[28:59] adoption so that people don't have that
[29:00] as an excuse and it might make some
[29:02] sense at the time but mess with it and
[29:05] there's
[29:06] consequences and recognize how brother
[29:08] brandom is addressing
[29:10] this and what it leads to because if you
[29:13] do change the IDE if you change the word
[29:14] in one place trust
[29:16] me it's G to it's going to show
[29:19] up you will deviate just a little bit
[29:21] you you you're going to it's going to
[29:23] manifest in other areas and if you
[29:24] reject the bride age you can only become
[29:27] lowercase pent costal if you reject
[29:29] adoption you can only become you'll only
[29:31] return back to your uh to your vomit
[29:33] there's a lot of things in there that if
[29:35] you mess with you're left with fleshly
[29:37] carnal glare of another age things so in
[29:41] where I think Pentecost failed he says I
[29:43] believe in shouting speaking in tongues
[29:46] and we all say Amen we believe in it of
[29:50] course we believe in it right otherwise
[29:53] I'd have been wrong we believe in
[29:54] shouting speaking in tongues but I'm
[29:56] trying to play something to you says you
[29:59] may be mad at me now but you won't be up
[30:03] there I like that you may be mad at me
[30:07] now you may not like me now but
[30:10] eventually you'll see that I'm
[30:11] correcting an erir in your way and it'll
[30:14] it'll give you true Liberty you'll make
[30:16] it he says notice it's true now watch
[30:18] what happened when this father after
[30:21] this child had been born into the family
[30:23] yet he did not inherit anything until
[30:25] his life proved out to be the right kind
[30:26] of a child and the tutor which is the
[30:29] holy spirit in our case brought word to
[30:31] the father all the time how this child
[30:34] was
[30:35] progressing now do you you does that is
[30:38] that familiar with us what brother mam
[30:39] taught on the obedient son he uses the
[30:43] tutor as the uh the Holy Ghost as the
[30:46] tutor in the examples he used in ancient
[30:49] times of the law of adoption he referred
[30:50] to it in the Old Testament a son was
[30:52] born into the family so he has the life
[30:54] of the father he's a son just the same
[30:56] and he's given a tutor to train him in
[30:58] the ways of the father and there comes a
[31:01] certain time that when the tutor reports
[31:03] back and says he's a chip off the old
[31:04] block he's great he's just like you and
[31:06] he has the ceremony of
[31:08] adoption now where the hangup is for a
[31:10] lot of people when they study the
[31:12] message of the hour brother Bram starts
[31:13] talking about a disobedient son and he
[31:16] says how that disobedient son doesn't go
[31:17] to church he doesn't believe in laying
[31:18] hands on the sick he stays out of church
[31:20] to watch I love Susi he smokes he drinks
[31:22] he cheats he does all these things and
[31:24] yet he's a son and brother R said he's a
[31:26] son but that son can't be adopted
[31:28] and the Instinct knowing what we know is
[31:30] to say well then he never had the Holy
[31:32] Ghost what he really needs is the Holy
[31:34] Ghost right and that wouldn't be
[31:37] illogical we reading all the things that
[31:39] brother brandham said that this
[31:40] Disobedience son did we wouldn't
[31:42] attribute that to the Holy Ghost so
[31:44] because that son needs adoption we could
[31:46] say then what he needs is an actual New
[31:49] Birth experience and then he won't do
[31:50] those things anymore and if we only stop
[31:54] there I'm wanting to preach a decade's
[31:56] worth of sermons right now if we only
[31:58] stop
[31:59] there then there there's some logic to
[32:02] it but brother Brenham always said let's
[32:05] change the picture but on the other hand
[32:08] let's look at the other son and this
[32:10] other son believes in laying hands on
[32:13] the sick he goes to the meting and he
[32:14] casts out Devils he goes to church he
[32:17] says what the father says he believes he
[32:18] does everything he's told to do and the
[32:20] tutor keeps coming back saying that's
[32:21] your boy he's a chip off the old block
[32:23] he's just like his daddy and he says
[32:25] that son needs a doctor
[32:30] if we're if we don't follow in the conu
[32:32] what brother br's trying to teach and
[32:33] present to the church especially in the
[32:34] hour and the age of adoption out of a
[32:37] Pentecostal age into a bride age out of
[32:38] a church age cycle into the open of the
[32:40] word if we don't catch the time he's
[32:42] trying to bring us to he's saying
[32:43] there's a time when the Holy Ghost Field
[32:45] are going to be placed to fulfill God's
[32:47] ultimate purpose to bring forth a
[32:49] translation and a change of our bodies
[32:52] an adoption time and brother says that
[32:55] son also needs adoption
[32:58] so the adoption is not your birth it's
[32:59] your placing that son who needs adoption
[33:02] that son who can be placed is not one
[33:05] who did all those things because of his
[33:09] own effort and discipline naturally
[33:11] brother said the evidence of the Holy
[33:12] Ghost is to believe your word that's
[33:13] what he says the obedient son does over
[33:15] and over again he says Amen to the word
[33:16] he says Amen to the word he has the Holy
[33:18] Ghost and because he's been patient
[33:20] because he's been faithful he comes to a
[33:22] place of maturity and adoption and
[33:24] placing and that's what brother bram's
[33:26] referring to here when he say says the
[33:28] Holy Ghost is a tutor in our case now
[33:31] we've tried to jump the fence we've
[33:33] tried to stick the cart before the horse
[33:36] you tried to claim things and do things
[33:38] before God did it and got a lot of Flesh
[33:41] worked up into it and that's what's the
[33:43] matter with the
[33:45] church notice where he's identifying the
[33:48] problem with the church has something to
[33:50] do with the beginning of things the holy
[33:54] ghost moving but not a trusting the
[33:56] faith not being join with
[33:58] patience he says I believe in these
[34:01] things but I'm trying to place something
[34:02] before you we've jumped the fence got
[34:03] the cart before the horse claim things
[34:05] do things get a lot of work up in the
[34:07] flesh he said that's what's the matter
[34:08] with the church his title is where I
[34:11] think Pentecost failed so I was looking
[34:12] at this from the stpoint this week of
[34:15] well how does he really Define Pentecost
[34:17] and he says earlier in the message there
[34:19] was a a group of people called
[34:20] themselves Pentecost saw the pillar fire
[34:23] received the Holy Ghost received the
[34:25] gifts of the Spirit speaking in tongues
[34:27] and so forth and away they went moved
[34:29] right on out and caused a
[34:32] Revival this is that genuine outpouring
[34:35] of the Holy Spirit into the leot Dean
[34:37] age the restoration of the gifts it is
[34:41] is this Mark and this characterization
[34:43] as Pentecost but brother R is saying
[34:45] they failed somewhere along the
[34:48] way and he's talking about being adopted
[34:51] he's talking about this process and
[34:52] having the Holy Spirit he says you don't
[34:54] have to talk so much about it God does
[34:57] his own talk
[34:58] talking now I'm trying to summarize an
[35:01] entire Sermon Just even not just where
[35:03] Pentecost failed
[35:05] but this idea of patient Liberty Faith
[35:09] being married together with patience
[35:10] producing the
[35:12] promise and the concept of adoption
[35:16] brother says we've tried to claim things
[35:18] do things before God did it got a lot of
[35:20] work up in the
[35:21] flesh and he and he's talking about how
[35:23] that we gone out we've moved out cause
[35:25] Revival but he says God does his own
[35:28] talking God testifies of his gifts but
[35:32] all those gifts are
[35:34] wonderful they are
[35:36] Dandy and we love them all
[35:40] better right you're not a better more
[35:43] revelated Christian if you despise the
[35:45] gifts if you talk bad about people who
[35:47] are more emotional and you make fun of
[35:49] churches that have a certain way of
[35:50] expressing themselves in worship you're
[35:52] you're not a better Christian than those
[35:54] who say that we're not a good church
[35:56] because we don't have those things we're
[35:58] just as bad so they're Dandy we love
[36:00] them they're
[36:02] wonderful God grant that every one of us
[36:04] would have every
[36:06] gift but I'd rather have the giver than
[36:08] all the
[36:09] gifts I'd rather have the giver than all
[36:12] the gifts Paul said though I have the
[36:13] gifts without the giver he says now if
[36:16] we have been went to if we had went to
[36:19] seeking the giver instead of the gifts I
[36:22] believe the church would have been
[36:23] farther up the
[36:24] road now if you could recognize this
[36:27] within the continuity of the message of
[36:28] the hour that brother Brandon brought
[36:30] the church to a place where we came up
[36:32] higher to see God in his program that at
[36:34] the open of the word from then on comes
[36:36] the word and the word only Look Away to
[36:38] Jesus we're now having our spiritual
[36:40] Amnesia removed we're coming to know the
[36:42] our mate the revealed word we're
[36:44] believing that we're in this cycle of a
[36:46] change we know we're going to meet him
[36:47] one day in the air but just let a little
[36:50] time pass and we get a little bit
[36:51] anxious instead of continuing to seek
[36:54] his face instead of staying in his
[36:56] presence we chased after the
[36:59] gifts instead of The Giver the Holy
[37:03] Ghost and those gifts that got poured
[37:04] out made away for the Holy Ghost himself
[37:06] but after time we get impatient and we
[37:09] chase after the
[37:11] gifts he says if we would have just
[37:13] sought the giver instead of the gifts
[37:14] we'd be further down the road he says
[37:16] don't you think
[37:17] so if we'd stayed close to God and loved
[37:21] him here's the Simplicity that is in
[37:22] Christ and just kept living for him and
[37:25] not trying to push things over just live
[37:28] for God and live a pure holy life and
[37:30] live and pray every day and keep
[37:32] yourself refreshed in his presence God
[37:34] will take care of the rest of it isn't
[37:37] that just isn't that
[37:38] awesome I'm not saying this is just easy
[37:40] that in the morning all you got to do is
[37:41] pop a pill and you're going to do this
[37:44] it's a fight to do it but man this is
[37:46] the way to live don't try to push things
[37:48] over just live for God live a holy life
[37:51] pray every day keep yourself in his
[37:53] presence God will take care of the
[37:56] rest what the rest of what everything
[37:58] else do this believe God trust him with
[38:01] your life stay in his presence pray read
[38:03] your Bible God will take care of the
[38:05] rest and then he says now you could get
[38:07] by with anything in
[38:10] America everybody still awake let's hear
[38:13] this let's listen to this he says now
[38:15] you can get by with anything in
[38:18] America I went to a service here not
[38:21] long ago now let's see if you can guess
[38:23] what service he was in I went to a
[38:25] service here not long ago and they were
[38:26] supposed to be practicing Divine Healing
[38:28] the fellow was jumping up and down
[38:30] screaming to the top of his voice and
[38:32] kicking the pulpit as hard as he could
[38:34] and said God I demand
[38:36] you oh mercy I thought God be merciful
[38:40] to my brother he doesn't understand who
[38:43] are we to demand God do anything he's
[38:46] already done it just believe him that's
[38:49] all had an old fellow in a sheet shaking
[38:52] him back and forth like this a man with
[38:53] heart trouble I felt sorry for him
[38:55] another man come up with rheumatism he
[38:57] shook that away and hit he hit him just
[38:59] as hard as he could with his hand and
[39:00] said I hate rheumatism said that don't
[39:03] take Devils
[39:04] out Devils don't care how much you
[39:07] holler he's not hard of
[39:10] hearing but he certainly knows where
[39:12] Faith lays and that's one thing that'll
[39:15] make him
[39:16] move remember how brother baram
[39:19] conducted his prayer because we believe
[39:20] in prayer lines I preached this uh not
[39:23] this past weekend the weekend before
[39:25] last time I preached on a weekend was in
[39:26] flag step and just I thought there were
[39:28] wonderful meetings there in Flagstaff
[39:31] and we preached on the union of the
[39:34] visible with the
[39:35] invisible and we we preaching on just
[39:38] the open of the word Gentile faith and
[39:40] those things and i' preached on Saturday
[39:42] night and in the office the next morning
[39:43] one of the pastors from Denver said
[39:45] brother Aaron what do you think about
[39:46] prayer lines and I was like who's been
[39:48] peeking at my notes and brother Jim Ed
[39:51] Dalton said we believe in prayer lines I
[39:53] just deferred to him he said we believe
[39:54] in it brother brandham did it and I
[39:55] believe we can do it and I say Amen to
[39:57] that I believe in it I absolutely
[39:59] believe in the laying on of hands I
[40:00] think it's important but my what I said
[40:02] is I think sometimes the context is
[40:04] missing where we don't have the
[40:06] appropriate context that we're laying
[40:08] hands on the sick according to the word
[40:10] of
[40:11] God and when you're healed through this
[40:13] Dynamic is because God made a promise
[40:15] and with the proper context we don't
[40:17] create the negative Dynamic of relying
[40:19] on an evangelist hands or the mechanics
[40:22] of the prayer line because there's times
[40:25] when brother brandham has said would
[40:26] call a prayer line or that brother Bram
[40:28] and his prayer lines they were done away
[40:30] in a particular way that was
[40:32] reverent and there's times when he
[40:34] manifested a gift in a very profound
[40:36] staggering way of looking into people's
[40:38] hearts and lives but then he would also
[40:40] say come through the prayer line now and
[40:42] he'd say Lord give her her healing Lord
[40:44] grant her healing now you tell me you
[40:47] tell me was one better than the other
[40:51] can both be just as
[40:52] effective and and there was a way that
[40:54] he was doing it where he wasn't trying
[40:56] to scare the devil he wasn't yelling and
[40:58] screaming he wasn't getting all worked
[40:59] up but it was done in such a way to
[41:02] where the people could take God at his
[41:04] word and not the
[41:05] Charisma the Riz of the
[41:15] Prophet that don't take out
[41:18] Devils he says continue I'm just reading
[41:21] this directly in all the these
[41:22] paragraphs in a row here he says Jesus
[41:25] had the greatest anointing of any man
[41:27] that was ever on the earth anybody want
[41:29] to guess when that
[41:33] was is that right one day he went into
[41:37] the temple anybody want to guess now was
[41:40] it when he braided the Whip and got
[41:42] angry and shouted and screamed and
[41:43] kipped over tables right that had to be
[41:45] it right they gave him the scroll he
[41:48] picked it up with his hand he sat down
[41:50] and he read over in Isaiah where it said
[41:51] the spirit of the Lord is upon me to
[41:52] preach the acceptable year and so forth
[41:54] the Jubilee year and he took the scroll
[41:56] and handed it back back and set down
[41:58] precious words proceed from his mouth
[42:00] the greatest anointing that was ever in
[42:02] the world on the Lord Jesus
[42:05] Christ while he
[42:09] was
[42:11] teaching I said it that's where the
[42:14] greatest anointing
[42:15] was he says oh sometimes we methodists
[42:18] get noise confused with anointing didn't
[42:21] realize we knew so many
[42:22] methodists sometimes we get noise
[42:24] confused with anointing noise ain't an
[42:27] oting no no I've seen where there's a
[42:29] lot of noise and not enough Faith to
[42:30] cure a toothache you've got to come
[42:32] solemnly to the father you've got to to
[42:34] know exactly where you are standing
[42:36] that's right I believe it with all my
[42:38] heart and I think that's where the
[42:40] church has
[42:42] failed I mean he's he's he's diagnosing
[42:46] things he's recognizing where the church
[42:49] failed now there's not some failure in
[42:53] the gifts the gifts are real there's not
[42:55] failure in shouting there's not failure
[42:57] in speaking in tongues there's not
[42:58] failure in laying hands on the sick
[42:59] there's not failure in believing that
[43:00] God's a Divine healer but it's that
[43:03] going it's that getting worked up and
[43:05] flesh getting worked into it and he's
[43:08] I'm going to show you as we keep reading
[43:09] here how brother Bram is identifying
[43:11] that there was this I want to say it in
[43:14] my words it's
[43:16] impatience I'm not trying to put words
[43:18] in brother Ram's mouth but it's this
[43:20] impatience he says I believe it with all
[43:22] my
[43:23] heart he said uh
[43:28] that's right I believe with all my heart
[43:29] I think that's where the church failed
[43:31] now listen I think we failed to bring
[43:33] love Among Us and to bring Fellowship
[43:36] among the groups and things like that
[43:39] and we've tried to push oursel into
[43:41] something that God has not
[43:43] ordained and I believe that we could
[43:45] just walk back down the line to God and
[43:47] say God here I
[43:48] stand nothing at all I have to offer you
[43:51] but my life but God I pray that you'll
[43:53] let me live so that I'll find Grace in
[43:55] your sight now you're coming along
[43:57] getting pretty close to the
[44:00] kingdom that's right then you'll see a
[44:02] real healing
[44:03] meeting it's there it's our
[44:06] promise when you come up to the altar
[44:09] don't come glory to God I received the
[44:11] Holy Ghost 40 years ago praise God
[44:13] hallelujah that don't do no good Satan
[44:17] don't care how much you say that the
[44:19] thing of it is to walk up with a true
[44:21] Assurance in your heart that you know
[44:23] where you are standing
[44:28] let's stay stay focused here we're doing
[44:31] really really good on
[44:32] time continuing he says' I was amazed
[44:35] here long ago not long ago at a little
[44:36] woman came down to the platform there
[44:38] were two of them together and one of
[44:40] them come through and said how do you do
[44:41] sister the brother B's addressing her in
[44:43] the prayer line he says now remember I
[44:46] believe in all the spiritual
[44:48] demonstrations yes sir I've received the
[44:51] baptism Holy Ghost and I know what I
[44:52] speak of and I trust you believe in them
[44:55] too we believe in it we have the Holy
[44:58] Ghost we know what we're talking about
[44:59] we when someone speaks in tongu which
[45:01] has happened in this church when someone
[45:02] shouts and cries it happens in this
[45:04] church when it happens it doesn't send a
[45:06] chill down our spine we love it we
[45:09] believe in it but there is brother bam
[45:12] is trying to place the church
[45:14] recognizing where they failed and he
[45:16] says and they come down the line and the
[45:18] little lady come up to the prayer line
[45:20] and she started dancing around real fast
[45:22] and I said would you stand still just a
[45:24] minute so I could speak to you she
[45:26] couldn't do it and she just kept dancing
[45:28] around well I thought I'll try the next
[45:31] one and I got the next one to come down
[45:33] and I tried to take a ho of her hand and
[45:34] I said oh I'd like to talk to you a
[45:36] little bit sister and then she started
[45:38] dancing around I said oh I love that
[45:40] it's it's beautiful I know Mariam danc
[45:43] in the spirit I believe in it yes sir
[45:46] all right so is there's a correction to
[45:47] any kind of attitude that would look at
[45:48] that and try to cast that out as an
[45:50] unclean SP cast that as an unclean
[45:51] Spirit we want to be very careful with
[45:53] that but yet we realize that in doing
[45:56] that alone it's zero Vindication at all
[45:59] about what's down inside of somebody's
[46:00] heart that's why brother Brandon most
[46:02] often identified the physical
[46:05] demonstration of the spirit through
[46:06] gifts and he called out cut hair and
[46:09] ungodly living and it follows in every
[46:12] movement that emphasizes it even in the
[46:18] message he says I believe in it yes sir
[46:21] but there's times for all
[46:23] things and when you're coming up here
[46:26] come come soberly in the presence of God
[46:29] come with a perfect assured heart that
[46:31] God's going to keep his word and melt
[46:33] yourself down by the Holy Spirit don't
[46:36] puff yourself up melt yourself down
[46:41] humility
[46:43] yielding and this is a staggering
[46:45] statement and the little lady I don't
[46:46] know what happened and one of them I'm
[46:48] sure had cancer she's probably dead
[46:51] tonight well that escalated
[46:54] quickly right she didn't just miss out
[46:56] on a Prayer
[46:57] she missed out on life I'm sure he says
[47:00] she had cancer she's probably dead
[47:03] tonight why but she just wouldn't stand
[47:08] still what did Brother bam say it was
[47:10] critical to dress in the bride with the
[47:12] word if she just sit still long
[47:14] enough you couldn't get anywhere because
[47:17] the woman had been taught wrong a
[47:19] wonderful person no doubt the wrong kind
[47:22] of teaching the wrong kind of emphasis
[47:25] and I we're looking at where Pentecost
[47:27] failed we're talking about patient
[47:28] Liberty we're wrapping this up tonight
[47:31] he said that woman was taught wrong she
[47:33] felt like she had to dance and push out
[47:35] things and do things and get all excited
[47:36] he saids now that was a Pentecostal
[47:38] woman so he's wanting us to understand
[47:40] what he means by
[47:42] Pentecost and here stood a little woman
[47:44] behind me that belonged to what we call
[47:46] a formal
[47:48] denomination standing back there with a
[47:50] little girl and she wasn't making a move
[47:52] at all and she had her prayer card and
[47:54] she walked standing there waiting what a
[47:56] beautiful picture of two kinds of
[47:58] message Believers right the the uh the
[48:01] fundamental the formal you know maybe
[48:04] the one that or looks that way and the
[48:07] others that may be more
[48:08] charismatic I can't remember how brother
[48:11] kidra digs you know used the language to
[48:13] express it but there's that fundamental
[48:15] Faith but then there's the Pentecostal
[48:17] experience and and there's a genuine of
[48:19] that but what a different picture
[48:21] someone coming they they obviously
[48:23] believe they're they're in the prayer
[48:24] line they're just too busy doing a jig
[48:26] and time for the prophet to pray for
[48:28] them to get their healing and they'
[48:29] danced danced and shouted and brother B
[48:31] said they're
[48:33] dead probably dead tonight but here's
[48:36] one who seems to be more of a formal
[48:39] sort and she wasn't making a move at
[48:42] all after a while they give time for her
[48:45] to come the little lady walked out the
[48:47] little girl walked up there took a hold
[48:48] of my hand she said look at here mother
[48:50] began to raise her leg and her mother
[48:52] began crying wilted down she said
[48:54] brother bandam I know it would happen
[48:56] just knew it would happen she said I
[48:58] believe with all my heart I said what
[49:00] was wrong with the child she said she
[49:02] was paralyzed in both legs there it was
[49:05] there you
[49:06] are before before she even got there got
[49:09] up there says look here mama been it'
[49:12] been
[49:13] resolved she come the appropriate
[49:16] way she come fearing God God believing
[49:21] walking up there reverent before God
[49:23] believing his promise do you realize how
[49:26] the devil is trying to shake something
[49:28] in front of us and get us all excited
[49:30] and bring us out of that real sober
[49:32] God-fearing
[49:34] Faith he said where a real saintly
[49:37] little woman just m mistaught came
[49:40] across the plat platform I couldn't even
[49:42] pray for and the woman thought she was
[49:45] in the spirit she was in the
[49:48] flesh but of course she was there she
[49:51] should have stayed showed what was in
[49:53] that Spirit the fruits prove what it was
[49:56] when you come to God you must come
[49:58] soberly sanely believing
[50:01] asking then if God heals you sure then
[50:03] raise your hands and give him praise
[50:04] that's right that little woman walked
[50:07] down there and hugged that little girl
[50:08] the father came running out of the
[50:09] audience like that he said brother I've
[50:11] been a sinner for years my wife's a
[50:12] Christian can I find Jesus right now I
[50:15] said yes my brother just kneel right
[50:16] here see that's the way we want the
[50:18] meeting isn't that
[50:20] right that's
[50:22] something that's sane solid and is sound
[50:26] that's the kind of church we
[50:28] want that's the kind of church I want I
[50:32] want a church that believes God that's
[50:35] God-fearing godb believing that's
[50:37] reverent before God believes his
[50:39] promises where there's liberty for God
[50:41] to heal there's liberty for someone to
[50:43] come and get prayed for if they need to
[50:45] there's liberty for them to shout and to
[50:47] praise God when they're healed but not
[50:48] this oppressive Dynamic of making
[50:51] everyone feel compelled to fit a certain
[50:55] image and every everyone feeling like
[50:57] they failed because they don't fit it
[51:00] something's lacking something's
[51:04] wrong The Other Woman this Pentecostal
[51:07] woman was thought she was in the spirit
[51:09] but she was in the
[51:10] flesh but this mom this maybe more
[51:13] formal the more reserved type she just
[51:15] stood there believing she wasn't moved
[51:17] at
[51:17] all and before she even get before
[51:20] brother brandom healing had taken
[51:23] place she came the appropriated way
[51:27] God-fearing God
[51:32] believing those who are playing could
[51:34] come to their instruments in Psalms
[51:36] 46:10 be
[51:38] still and know that I am
[51:43] God I will be exalted among the Heathen
[51:46] I will be exalted in the earth he will
[51:47] be
[51:48] exalted he will manifestly declare his
[51:51] presence he will prove himself to be the
[51:53] same yesterday today and forever he will
[51:55] move in our midst whether it be ways of
[51:57] Divine Healing or even a refreshing or
[51:59] Reviving in our physical Spirits there
[52:01] can be crying there can be weeping there
[52:02] can be dancing there can be shouting
[52:04] there could be people slay in the spirit
[52:06] but we must first be still and know that
[52:09] he is God resting trusting
[52:14] patient brother brand in the sermon
[52:16] experiences says now I do not wish for
[52:18] anyone to be in a hurry he's talking
[52:20] about how when Jesus's name was first
[52:22] mentioned it caused the baby to jump in
[52:24] the womb of Elizabeth he says now I do
[52:26] not not wish for anyone to be in a hurry
[52:29] you write this down this to make a great
[52:30] uh you can make it for the Graham do
[52:33] some really nice
[52:34] watercolor uh fating and a beautiful
[52:37] sunset in the background and manifesting
[52:39] abundance he says I do not wish for
[52:42] anyone to be in a hurry always be just
[52:45] as quiet and just as calm and
[52:48] cool be quiet be calm and cool this is
[52:54] what brother BR is saying before you
[52:55] come to a prayer line don't get worked
[52:57] up don't become fanatical just be quiet
[53:02] calm and
[53:11] cool I'm wanting to be I want to
[53:15] be in the center of God's perfect will
[53:19] and I go to Great Links uh in speaking
[53:21] on this to where I'm not I don't feel
[53:23] that I need to
[53:25] emphasize uh
[53:27] well my emphasis is trying to bring a
[53:28] balance away from some of the the fear
[53:31] factors the devil uses the Temptation
[53:33] he's using that enticement of our flesh
[53:35] the the the impatience of things need to
[53:38] be excitable things need to change and
[53:40] we're not just setting hearing the word
[53:42] of God we're not just uh receiving the
[53:44] anointing of the word and we're not
[53:46] growing and being more mature and and
[53:48] letting God do the rest there's a lot of
[53:50] emotional workup and things so I feel
[53:51] like there's maybe this need to uh uh to
[53:54] call to away from one side but in doing
[53:56] doing so I'm not I don't want to be
[54:00] identified with those that point the
[54:01] finger at the other
[54:03] group and make fun of and laugh and poke
[54:05] and
[54:06] ridicule I think it just eventually what
[54:09] it just polarizes right and both sides
[54:11] start drawing swords and they start
[54:13] taking shots and eventually it's the one
[54:14] in the middle that takes all the
[54:16] shots and and if that's so I'm just glad
[54:19] that there's people in the
[54:20] middle that are willing to call to both
[54:23] sides and say come back to the balance
[54:24] of what the prophet taught take God at
[54:27] his word believe all things are possible
[54:29] but recognize the day and age we're
[54:30] living in and the promise for this hour
[54:32] and what the emphasis needs to be in
[54:34] this time and how God is bringing a
[54:36] bride to Perfection and what her true
[54:38] Revival is and not try to rework message
[54:41] history massage the message and make
[54:43] things work this way so that it fits
[54:45] your particular Paradigm or can justify
[54:47] a certain way that you feel that things
[54:49] should be emphasized just take God at
[54:51] his
[54:52] word be still and know that I am God
[54:57] the power of transformation says now
[54:58] that's what we're here for he's talking
[54:59] about the word the word the word the
[55:01] word he said that's my message has been
[55:02] all along is the word of God we must
[55:04] hold to that regardless of what other
[55:06] things take
[55:08] place always stay with that
[55:12] word always check out your motives and
[55:14] objectives if it's according to the word
[55:16] of God if it isn't leave it
[55:19] alone but if it's with the word of God
[55:21] and lines up with the word of God then
[55:24] you hold to that
[55:29] patience because he says God sometimes
[55:31] just like our little group here this
[55:32] morning he lets it not happen just
[55:35] overnight we're the ones that get in a
[55:38] hurry God is never in a hurry he just
[55:43] says it and it's going to be for when he
[55:47] says anything it's got to be it's just
[55:50] going to be he lets it take its
[55:54] time it's going to happen Saints
[55:58] whatever he's promised is going to
[55:59] happen let's just be patient trust him
[56:03] at every turn in every moment believing
[56:07] Lord you made the promise no matter how
[56:10] dark it gets you made the promise I will
[56:13] see it through to the
[56:15] end that's the message that it's been
[56:18] all along it's the word of God hold to
[56:19] that stay with
[56:21] that there's a lot for you to consider
[56:23] in these things I trust that if you're
[56:24] listening to these things you go back
[56:27] and think about them take them all
[56:28] together on the subject of Liberty
[56:31] because this is what we want in our
[56:32] lives is true Liberty perfect Liberty
[56:34] and I started with perfect Liberty and
[56:36] then we dealt with imperfect Liberty and
[56:38] impatient Liberty and today we finish
[56:41] with patient Liberty there's your
[56:43] patience let patience have her perfect
[56:45] work that you may be perfect and entire
[56:48] wanting nothing Brother David if you
[56:49] could just get ready maybe to lead in
[56:51] worship after we begin worship let's
[56:53] just stand together
