[0:00] Hebrews chapter 13 I start with verse 7
[0:02] verse 7 I think is an important
[0:04] scripture before a very familiar
[0:06] scripture verse 8 and it says remember
[0:08] them which have the rule over you who
[0:11] have spoken unto you the word of God
[0:13] whose Faith follow considering the end
[0:15] of their conversation and the statement
[0:18] that is so familiar to all of us Jesus
[0:20] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[0:24] forever so in this admonishment to
[0:27] remember them that speak unto you the
[0:29] word of God who have some sort of
[0:30] oversight over you it's you're following
[0:33] in their faith or their example because
[0:35] you are considering their testimony the
[0:37] end the results the product of their
[0:39] lives and it leads to this Jesus Christ
[0:42] the same yesterday today and forever you
[0:46] could be seated as you're looking at
[0:48] this title slide and we'll just hold it
[0:50] there uh for a few moments looking at
[0:52] the statement Jesus Christ this same
[0:54] yesterday today and forever I've titled
[0:58] this uh original reality
[1:01] and and maybe phrase that we'll use
[1:02] later is in present context I think I
[1:06] just have it here and and as far as a
[1:08] title for this sermon original reality
[1:11] present context and you could even tell
[1:13] just by the graphic that we have up here
[1:15] of the picture that trying to convey
[1:17] something that would be original
[1:19] something that would be what we would
[1:21] imagined Christ to be even in the
[1:23] beginning uh but yet in a present
[1:25] context because the Bible says he is the
[1:28] same Jesus Christ is the same yeser
[1:29] today today and forever and if we could
[1:33] look at the statement in Christ
[1:35] identified the same in all
[1:38] generations and I believe it was on
[1:40] Sunday that we shared this and uh you'll
[1:43] probably remember this this subject in
[1:45] Christ ident is identified in the same
[1:47] in all generations there's several
[1:49] sermons that brother man preaches in
[1:51] 1964 that build around this and so
[1:55] there's a lot of different things you
[1:56] could go to and listen and he says now
[1:58] what was Jesus the same yesterday today
[2:01] and forever now in answering that
[2:04] question it doesn't give us much details
[2:06] to go by we just know that whatever he
[2:08] was he's going to be the same now if he
[2:11] stood wear here wearing this suit that I
[2:13] got on that he gave me now if the woman
[2:16] is sick could he heal her and he's
[2:18] wanting to look at it from a different
[2:20] angle he's given this example of being
[2:23] in a prayer line as you go through some
[2:24] of these sermons he says look at this
[2:26] picture that we have here this picture's
[2:28] a lot like it was in John chapter 4 and
[2:31] he uses this scene of him being on the
[2:33] platform in those 1964 in these meetings
[2:37] wearing a suit in a modern-day attire
[2:39] and saying if Jesus was here wearing
[2:41] this suit I have on what what could he
[2:43] do and he says could he heal her and he
[2:45] cautions and he says be careful now be
[2:47] careful no he couldn't do it he's
[2:50] already done it and he brings into the
[2:53] scripture he was wounded for our
[2:54] transgressions by his stripes we were
[2:56] healed he has already done it now that
[3:00] speaks to an act in the wounding and the
[3:03] bleeding in the giving of his life that
[3:05] Christ it is not necessary for him to
[3:08] come and do that again uh to heal her
[3:10] it's something he's already uh promised
[3:12] so he says the only thing he could do
[3:14] would just identify himself to her is
[3:17] that right and make it known that he's
[3:19] raised from the dead and alive and now
[3:21] that he would identify himself and this
[3:26] goes back to the subject matter on
[3:27] Sunday this title God hidden in
[3:30] profanity and we are using the emphasis
[3:32] that God the word this great God who
[3:34] spans all time and space that it would
[3:36] become a reality in just ordinary
[3:39] everyday life not in uh religion not in
[3:42] pretense not in some glare of another
[3:44] age and I believe I used the statement
[3:46] The Challenge and I think the way that I
[3:49] phrased it and I I hope that it went
[3:50] across the right way I got some
[3:52] tremendous feedback and had good
[3:53] Fellowship on it but I think it was says
[3:55] live Godly enough uh uh to be separate
[3:58] and uh but be human enough uh to be able
[4:01] to be identified or people be able to
[4:03] see it and I thought well maybe the the
[4:05] limiting language to say live live Godly
[4:08] enough wasn't exactly right but it's
[4:10] living Godly as humans that we want to
[4:13] live Godly as human beings in the
[4:15] context of this modern world that that's
[4:18] what our challenge is is to live Godly
[4:20] as humans still being natural beings in
[4:23] this modern world that we're living in
[4:25] and if we could look at this statement
[4:28] this way and I appreciate your attention
[4:29] eness tonight I can tell you just really
[4:32] uh really focused on what it is I'm I'm
[4:34] trying to express brother B says if
[4:36] Jesus Christ was standing here with this
[4:39] suit that I have on now when he says
[4:41] that that orients us to that time period
[4:43] here was April 15th 1964 and the suit
[4:47] begins to frame context of today at that
[4:50] time when he's speaking it it's not a
[4:52] yesterday because he doesn't say if
[4:53] Jesus was standing here in a robe or
[4:56] with crowns or sandals but he says if
[4:58] Jesus Christ was standing here to today
[4:59] with this suit I have on not yesterday
[5:02] not in the future uh he doesn't describe
[5:04] maybe a future attire but it's something
[5:06] in a modern setting and he says he
[5:09] couldn't he says what would he do now
[5:12] because Jesus Christ is the same
[5:13] yesterday today and forever so he's
[5:15] looking at the present tense he says
[5:17] what would he do now not yesterday and
[5:19] when he mentions the cross he's already
[5:21] paid the price on the cross that
[5:23] references yesterday he shed his blood
[5:25] he gave his life for our healing and our
[5:27] Salvation that's been purchased he did
[5:30] that yesterday and having been done
[5:33] yesterday we have salvation today we
[5:36] have healing today but not through
[5:38] anything that we need to do now to
[5:40] purchase it to accomplish it he just
[5:43] needs to identify himself today and make
[5:45] himself known today to Quicken our faith
[5:47] to believe in those things and one of
[5:50] the themes that brother Bram is using in
[5:52] these different sermons that Christ is
[5:53] identified the same in all generations
[5:56] and then there's several other sermons
[5:57] along these lines I have uh
[6:00] a list of sermons for those who would
[6:02] like like to listen to them or study
[6:04] them or at least maybe search through
[6:05] them or browse through them there's
[6:07] several that fit this uh theme in
[6:10] 1964 but God will he's teaching and I've
[6:13] gone through these sermons just to find
[6:15] these themes God will identify himself
[6:17] in every
[6:18] generation and it's not a matter of
[6:21] recollection and saying oh he was this
[6:23] or he was that uh the Bible would be
[6:25] good enough for historical record but he
[6:28] will identify himself in every age by
[6:30] his character it's not that he comes in
[6:33] the same image brother brandom says in
[6:35] see the discrepancy that Jesus Christ is
[6:37] the same in every detail except the
[6:39] physical body so there's something maybe
[6:42] in what would literally strike the eye
[6:44] that wouldn't necessarily be in the same
[6:45] form that it was yesterday but there's
[6:47] something today that is the same
[6:50] character that it was before he uses
[6:52] this phrase that he would identify
[6:54] himself this is the phrase in a line of
[6:56] the word for that age for the age that
[6:59] they were living
[7:01] in so his character will be the same
[7:04] today in the present world as it was
[7:07] yesterday in history ancient world
[7:09] through the church ages in the Bible his
[7:11] character will be the same today in the
[7:13] present world as it was yesterday in
[7:16] ages gone by and that's why I use this
[7:19] phrase as a title original reality in
[7:23] present context the original reality
[7:25] would be what was manifested what was
[7:27] real what was true what was accurate
[7:29] that that full expression of God and
[7:31] Christ and how it unfolded that first
[7:33] perfect expression now we could we could
[7:36] say that was in Jesus Christ but we
[7:38] could also say all the way back to the
[7:39] beginning whatever that original reality
[7:42] was that was foreshadowed or portrayed
[7:44] that that first expression that original
[7:47] intent of God that character that he
[7:48] displayed being restored today that
[7:52] there's something that comes forth fresh
[7:55] and real and genuine today uh that is an
[7:57] expression of that original re but it's
[8:00] in the present day context one way that
[8:03] we've been emphasizing this is that God
[8:05] is the artist he's the one that creates
[8:07] he's the Creator and you are the
[8:10] creation you are the created so he is
[8:12] the one that is authoring you are the
[8:14] one that he is finishing and the setting
[8:17] that he has placed Us in is this modern
[8:19] world I know we sometimes dream for days
[8:22] gone you know days past and I find
[8:24] myself uh just through my the season of
[8:27] life that I've been in over the last
[8:28] several years as I've tried to go back
[8:30] through my life and piece together
[8:31] certain things and try to maybe answer
[8:33] questions for today and why I am the way
[8:35] that I am and things that have happened
[8:37] and spend a lot of times just trying to
[8:38] piece together my childhood and young uh
[8:41] uh my adolescence and teenage years and
[8:43] young adulthood and there's times where
[8:45] it's like man if you could just go back
[8:47] to that the way things were then and
[8:50] have a little bit different experience
[8:51] based upon where I am now and sometimes
[8:53] we have a Nostalgia for things gone by
[8:56] oh if we could just lived in this time
[8:57] and lived in that time well uh that's
[8:59] not possible right now and so we have to
[9:02] live where we are we're living in this
[9:05] time and age that we're in and being
[9:08] what God has created and being new
[9:10] creatures in Christ Jesus for the time
[9:12] that we're living in now there we have
[9:14] to be able to look at the context of
[9:17] where God is placing us if we were to
[9:20] say wow uh we're we're Before Time even
[9:23] begins and let's say we know the whole
[9:24] story and he says I'm going to send you
[9:27] and you're going to be Noah then we
[9:28] immediately begin to build the context
[9:30] for what our life would look like say
[9:32] well I'm going to be tasked with uh
[9:34] marrying and having these sons and I'm
[9:35] going to have to build an ark and I'm
[9:36] going to do this and I'm going to do
[9:37] that and you would have more a very a
[9:40] great catalog if you knew all things of
[9:42] what your life would look like and so
[9:45] art can only be fully appreciated if the
[9:48] context is understood you can really
[9:51] only re appreciate what it is and fully
[9:54] understand it in its proper context if
[9:56] we were just looking at Natural Art
[9:57] you'd want to know uh what time per
[9:59] period it was uh painted in you'd want
[10:01] to even know what his historical period
[10:03] it represents you'd want to know the
[10:04] culture the person that's that was
[10:07] creating it the materials that were used
[10:09] all those things form the context of
[10:12] what you're looking at and what is being
[10:14] portrayed the environment the situation
[10:16] uh or even the atmosphere in which the
[10:18] art was created how it was spread and
[10:20] how one experiences it that all forms
[10:23] one's perception or helps you to
[10:25] understand the art as I've been uh
[10:28] appreciating art more more and more
[10:29] these days and a and wanting to uh learn
[10:33] from it and experience it in a way that
[10:34] it can convey what what the meaning that
[10:36] was intended you find that there's a lot
[10:38] you can learn about the artist that
[10:40] unlocks what you're looking at there's a
[10:42] lot that you learn about where they were
[10:44] when they were painting at the time
[10:45] period And so context is important to be
[10:47] able to fully understand and appreciate
[10:50] what is being created so if we look at
[10:52] ourselves as being the creation then
[10:54] there's things that we want to know
[10:55] about the Creator there's things we want
[10:57] to know about us who's being created and
[10:59] then the context is very important to
[11:02] understand what the artist has in mind
[11:04] for his
[11:06] creation Now if this seems to be
[11:09] somewhat of a uh a you know hard
[11:12] right-and turn here just buckle up or
[11:14] hold tight but let's turn to Titus
[11:17] Chapter 2 and verses 2 to8 and I I
[11:21] remember originally I was going to use
[11:23] this as my text and so maybe there's uh
[11:26] skipping a little bit here but he's
[11:27] speaking about Paul giv his introduction
[11:30] in verse one that he's a servant of God
[11:32] and according to the faith of God's
[11:34] elect and he's telling him but speak
[11:36] thou those things which become sound
[11:38] Doctrine so he's he's admonishing to
[11:40] speak these things which are sound
[11:43] Doctrine and he says that here's the
[11:44] sound Doctrine now if we could start to
[11:48] get a little bit more practical or focus
[11:51] in because zero in a little bit more
[11:53] precisely on what I would say is my
[11:56] thesis statement through these first
[11:57] several services this year
[11:59] and what is meant by this original
[12:01] reality it's real we may not and let's
[12:05] say it's hidden it's a mystery that is
[12:07] going to be expressed in present context
[12:10] and what would it look like if this
[12:12] original reality begin to manifest
[12:14] itself and unfold itself where we are
[12:16] today this zeros in a little bit on what
[12:19] I mean by this here as he is expounding
[12:23] teaching that he should have sound
[12:25] Doctrine this is what you should teach
[12:26] and these are the things that are taught
[12:28] that the Aged men be sober grave
[12:30] temperate sound in faith and charity in
[12:32] patience the aged women likewise that
[12:35] they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness
[12:37] not false accusers not giving to much
[12:39] wine teachers of good things that they
[12:41] may teach the young women to be sober to
[12:43] love their husbands to love their
[12:44] children to be discreet chaste keepers
[12:46] at home good obedient to their own
[12:48] husbands that the word of God be not
[12:50] blasphemed young men likewise exhort to
[12:53] be sober minded in all things showing
[12:55] thyself a good pattern excuse me showing
[12:57] thyself a pattern of good Works in
[13:00] Doctrine showing uncorrupt this gravity
[13:03] sincerity sound speech that cannot be
[13:06] condemned that he that is of the
[13:08] contrary part may be ashamed having no
[13:10] evil thing to say of you that's a a
[13:14] mouthful a lot there there's so many
[13:17] things there that uh we could begin to
[13:20] focus in on in uh great detail very
[13:24] granular as it applies to aged men aged
[13:26] women young men young ladies and and in
[13:29] all so there's a lot here that we could
[13:30] look at so I'm going to take this I took
[13:32] it this week and was studying each one
[13:34] of these things and trying to put it in
[13:36] maybe a modern context or language I
[13:38] just want to do it very very fast that
[13:40] if we are to look at this today he would
[13:43] say that the men ought to be learning to
[13:45] be
[13:46] self-controlled to exhibit uh you know a
[13:50] strong uh self-control control your
[13:52] emotions control your behavior that they
[13:55] be in the habit of Good Deeds that they
[13:57] be they have integrity and dignity in
[13:59] their way that they speak that they're
[14:01] honest in their disagreements with
[14:03] others so that the adversary the one
[14:06] with which they have a disagreement or
[14:08] on the contrary part has no cause to
[14:11] speak evil these are things that young
[14:14] men ought to be learning because you're
[14:15] to exhort them to be self-controlled in
[14:18] the habit of Good Works have integrity
[14:20] and dignity in the in the way that you
[14:22] speak and handle situations if there be
[14:24] some contention or disagreement be
[14:26] honest so that those that you have a
[14:28] disagreement with and some could say
[14:30] those who are disbelievers or be of the
[14:32] opposition you're not giving them a
[14:34] reason to speak
[14:36] evil that we we are going to give people
[14:39] reason to disagree with us whether we
[14:41] put it in the context of being Believers
[14:42] or not people will disagree but you can
[14:45] handle disagreement you could handle
[14:47] variance in such a way to where they're
[14:48] not just saying he's wrong and I
[14:50] disagree with them they say they're evil
[14:53] they're Liars they're condescending
[14:54] they're they don't know how to handle
[14:57] adversity so there's these are the
[14:58] things that you're to teach young men or
[15:01] that young men and I'd say to Rowan and
[15:03] Elliot and Preston the different ones
[15:04] here these are things that they ought to
[15:06] be learning now so that the character
[15:08] that results is what he said that men
[15:11] ought to be these aged men they would
[15:13] demonstrate self-control this is their
[15:16] character now they would be honest they
[15:18] would have strong faith they would have
[15:19] an unselfish love and they'd be patient
[15:22] so there's things that you should be
[15:24] teaching young men and these are the
[15:26] things that they're learning so that
[15:28] when they become aged and whatever that
[15:30] would mean they would have this kind of
[15:33] character they're they're disciplined
[15:34] they show self-control they're honest
[15:36] they have a strong faith they have an
[15:37] unselfish love and they're patient
[15:40] that's the image of how young men are to
[15:43] be taught and this is the character that
[15:45] results from that teaching then to the
[15:48] women so the young women are to be
[15:49] learning how to love uh their husband
[15:51] and
[15:52] children this is something that ought to
[15:54] be taught something that they take have
[15:56] these young ladies to be learning is to
[15:58] to do these things to be self-controlled
[16:01] pure Homemakers good submitted to their
[16:04] own husbands so that the word of God is
[16:06] Not Dishonored now it says submitted to
[16:09] their own husband so there is this
[16:11] teaching this emphasis that a woman is
[16:14] to be this willfully submitted to her
[16:16] husband not somebody else's husband not
[16:19] to some other authority but there's this
[16:21] working together in that relationship so
[16:24] that somebody else on the outside or
[16:26] somebody who's not a Believer would say
[16:28] my good they claim to believe this
[16:30] document and the woman has no respect to
[16:32] her husband it's not a very good
[16:34] testimony so there's a lot that's being
[16:36] used in that and that these things are
[16:38] to be taught so that this character that
[16:41] results it's described of these aged
[16:43] women or these women who are mature that
[16:46] they have since they're learning how to
[16:48] do these things that they have a
[16:49] character of Sanctified Behavior this
[16:51] Holiness they're not backbiters they
[16:54] have this they're tempered in their in
[16:56] their with their tongues they don't
[16:57] gossip they're not Bounder in bondage to
[17:00] intoxicants and maybe there's just a a
[17:03] broad way that you could spell that out
[17:04] they're teachers of good these are the
[17:07] this is the resulting character of young
[17:09] ladies being taught a certain way uh
[17:12] this is the character that it ought to
[17:14] manifest and in each one of these things
[17:16] where you say sober temperate sound in
[17:18] faith and not giving to much wine and
[17:21] and loving their husbands there's a lot
[17:22] of things that we could say are in
[17:24] general terms we say well it's kind of
[17:26] in an Old English slant well you could
[17:28] go and read it in modern language and
[17:30] it's going to present some of these very
[17:31] same ideals and we could paint a picture
[17:33] in our mind of what that ought to look
[17:35] like and we could imagine we might even
[17:37] see examples of it and regardless of the
[17:40] examples we've seen and how it literally
[17:42] expresses itself we recognize that what
[17:44] it would have looked like in Titus 2 is
[17:47] not going to be the exact same uh
[17:50] setting because that was a in a
[17:52] different age in a different time but
[17:54] it's going to have a proper
[17:55] manifestation in the time that we're
[17:57] living in now you don't just say oh well
[17:59] that's that's before that's when there
[18:00] was just two genders nowadays I mean we
[18:03] need we need Titus 1 2 third fourth
[18:05] fifth and sixth Titus uh to be able just
[18:07] to be a little bit more inclusive but
[18:10] this is a this is expressing principles
[18:13] and ideals that are in our Bible that is
[18:16] you know hundreds thousands of years old
[18:18] but yet can still ring true
[18:21] today now in the uh midrash Proverbs uh
[18:26] when it's addressing there's some Rich
[18:29] uh oral storytelling around the Queen of
[18:32] Sheba and they broke it down into
[18:35] several different riddles and different
[18:37] ways that uh she was testing Solomon's
[18:40] wisdom and brother bradam in the sermon
[18:42] God identifying himself by his
[18:44] characteristics in March uh 20th of 1964
[18:47] he refers to one of these riddles or
[18:49] these Parables and he refers to the one
[18:52] where uh the Queen of Sheba presented
[18:54] children who are of the same height the
[18:57] same attire so they looked the same and
[18:59] they were dressed the same and asked
[19:01] distinguish between the male and females
[19:04] so children were presented looking
[19:06] relatively the same and now Solomon was
[19:09] going to use his wisdom to find out
[19:10] whether one was a woman or one was a man
[19:12] or the boy or girl uh maybe be the more
[19:14] appropriate language and so Solomon had
[19:17] uh his servants put nuts and and roasted
[19:20] ears of corn on the ground before the
[19:22] children and they were told to collect
[19:24] them and as the the midrash describes it
[19:27] that the the boy collected them and then
[19:29] tied them within the hyms of their
[19:31] garments they weren't really concerned
[19:33] about how they looked they just wanted
[19:34] to get the food and they tied it up and
[19:36] they gathered it and they were able to
[19:38] collect it in such a way to where it's
[19:39] like all right I've got I've got my corn
[19:41] I've got these nuts uh this I've done
[19:43] what you've asked me to do but it says
[19:45] the girls tied them within their outer
[19:48] garments that if they had layered
[19:50] clothing maybe an apron or something
[19:51] that they didn't just go and hurriedly
[19:53] start to gather it in their garment they
[19:54] were very particular about doing it in
[19:56] their outer garment because they were
[19:58] bashful about their bodies that there
[20:01] was they were very careful not to expose
[20:03] their undergarments so the boys by
[20:06] nature but the boys expressed this
[20:07] unabashed about themselves but whereas
[20:10] the girls were a little bit more Meek
[20:12] and uh ashamed uh to act in a way that
[20:15] would dis discover their undergarment
[20:18] and it's by that that salmon said these
[20:20] are the boys and these are the girls and
[20:22] brother man refers to this Parable and
[20:24] he talks about men and women and he
[20:26] refers to how the men dress like women
[20:28] dress like man he says wow wouldn't that
[20:29] be on point today he said then it would
[20:32] would have been really weird and more of
[20:34] a challenge he says but today this is
[20:35] what's happening every day is I'm sorry
[20:37] ma'am sir I don't I don't know what you
[20:40] are what you identify as please don't
[20:42] judge me if I get it wrong and it's hard
[20:45] to distinguish anymore but the fact is
[20:47] and to me I think it speaks to the
[20:49] agenda that the world has or Satan has
[20:52] in removing these distinctions and
[20:55] making them more confusing but brother
[20:57] Brown points out that Solomon identified
[20:59] them by their
[21:00] characteristics and even in the context
[21:02] of the parable where in the next one uh
[21:05] the Queen of Sheba uh it it says to
[21:08] distinguish among these men uh who were
[21:11] circumcised and uncircumcised and the
[21:13] way that Solomon did it is he had them
[21:15] the priest in the parable priest bring
[21:17] the Ark of the Covenant and the Heathen
[21:19] laid down in a certain way but the Jew
[21:22] the circumcised bowed in a certain way
[21:26] and it showed the difference of learned
[21:29] behavior and so there are certain things
[21:31] that were innate or inherent to a boy
[21:34] and certain things inherent in a
[21:35] believer that they or that they were
[21:36] taught and so it's by their
[21:38] characteristics their nature that has
[21:40] been nurtured you teach women to to be
[21:42] shamefaced to be sober and to be H uh
[21:45] Meek and there's a certain respect that
[21:47] they'd have for their bodies whereas a
[21:48] man he's more he's less as shamed less
[21:50] ashamed he has things he needs to do and
[21:53] it's by their nature and the character
[21:54] that they've been taught that they
[21:55] disclose what they are these are the
[21:58] very things that Titus is drawing on
[22:00] aged men this is how you should be and
[22:02] since this is how you should be this is
[22:03] how you teach the young
[22:05] men and Solomon and brother bam using
[22:07] this uh Parable in God identifying
[22:10] himself by his characteristics says
[22:12] that's how you know something is by its
[22:14] characteristics at where we live I've
[22:16] been uh watching what could be Ravens or
[22:19] crows and what could be Hawks or Falcons
[22:22] fight on a regular basis in the air and
[22:24] I get my binoculars out and I watch them
[22:26] and I'm trying to learn by their
[22:27] behavior what they look like and their
[22:29] color and their size to say what are
[22:31] these are these Ravens fighting with the
[22:32] Falcon and what's happening and you know
[22:35] if you can know what what the nature and
[22:37] attributes are and then identify it and
[22:40] this is part of that theme that brother
[22:42] B's using in these several sermons
[22:44] whether be identification God is
[22:46] identified by his characteristics God
[22:47] identifying himself uh by his
[22:50] characteristics the identified Christ of
[22:52] all ages the identification of Christ in
[22:54] all ages Christ is identified the same
[22:56] in all generations the unveiling of God
[22:58] the identifi Christ in all ages and he's
[23:00] several sermons that he leads even to
[23:02] the Masterpiece and the identified
[23:04] Masterpiece all these sermons just
[23:06] building in the same
[23:08] thought now as
[23:10] we've kind of summarized these things in
[23:13] verses 2 to8 let's look at verse n and
[23:16] this is where uh kind of the plot
[23:18] thickens or it escalates exhort servants
[23:20] that word there I think does a
[23:22] disservice to what was originally meant
[23:24] to say servants because the word is
[23:27] slave exhorts servants exhort slaves to
[23:30] be obedient unto their own masters and
[23:32] to please them well in all things not
[23:34] answering again this word servant is a
[23:37] bond slave it's not one who is uh
[23:39] voluntarily rendering service or one
[23:41] that's paid it speaks of one who's uh uh
[23:43] indentured or otherwise owned exhort
[23:46] slaves to be obedience to their owners
[23:48] their own masters and to please them
[23:49] well in all things not answering again
[23:52] not purloining but showing all good
[23:54] Fidelity that they may Adorn the
[23:56] doctrine of God our savior in all things
[23:59] these are instructions to Slaves be
[24:02] loyal be of benefit to your owners in
[24:04] other words behave in such a way toward
[24:06] where it's profitable to them beneficial
[24:08] to them do not talk back that's not
[24:11] answer again don't talk back and this
[24:13] word there're not pining do not steal no
[24:16] matter how
[24:17] Petty in other words no purloining now
[24:19] don't think well this is a field full of
[24:21] corn I'll just take a couple ears Paul
[24:23] is telling them look don't take
[24:25] advantage of them don't don't be a petty
[24:27] Thief
[24:30] there's ways that it's expressing
[24:32] behavior for those who are uh owned by
[24:36] somebody else be of good character so
[24:38] that your good character would emanate
[24:40] from your actions and in doing so it
[24:42] would add a glory to the word of God or
[24:44] add glory to
[24:46] God one commentator said the slaves
[24:49] become the savior's Representatives
[24:51] responsible for conduct that can lead to
[24:53] their Master's
[24:55] salvation this is what expressed in the
[24:57] New Testament is reading some other
[24:58] places where Paul is is speaking to the
[25:02] believer who is the slave and whether
[25:04] their owner was a Believer or
[25:06] non-believer this is the kind of course
[25:07] of conduct for each one to engage in and
[25:11] say that the unbelieving master is at a
[25:13] disadvantage because the believing slave
[25:16] the one who is a slave has the
[25:17] Privileges of Eternity you'll find this
[25:20] in other teachings in the New Testament
[25:22] now and um and I'm not nervous and some
[25:25] of you may be getting really really
[25:26] nervous and saying stop the tape we
[25:28] about to get canceled but if you read
[25:31] the Bible and even read in great detail
[25:33] the Old Testament has its rules re
[25:34] revolving around uh slavery and very
[25:37] specifically uh how it operate within
[25:39] the context of the law and there was
[25:41] always this out there was always they
[25:43] were not to mistreat them and abuse them
[25:44] and so there was a certain context to
[25:46] slavery in the Old Testament very
[25:48] different than the slavery that is
[25:50] represented here that Paul is addressing
[25:52] whereas under the law the Israelite
[25:53] would be like well I I stand to be the
[25:55] owner but now when Paul is writing his
[25:57] letters Bond slaves were a reality in
[25:59] yesterday's Roman Empire these were a
[26:02] reality and Paul is writing and so what
[26:04] he does is he addresses the believer
[26:06] who's part of that reality he doesn't
[26:09] condone slavery he doesn't say it's okay
[26:11] and a lot of people have misused these
[26:13] scriptures to justify slavery and
[26:15] there's really it takes quite a
[26:17] contortion and perversion to use these
[26:19] scriptures to advocate for any kind of
[26:21] slavery but knowing this the situation
[26:24] that presently existed Paul addresses
[26:26] the believer who would be in it
[26:29] and doesn't advocate for them to
[26:30] overthrow it and use politics and use
[26:33] Force to overthrow an oppressive regime
[26:36] because the Bible is not interested in
[26:38] changing governments and politics and
[26:39] institutions the Bible and the gospel is
[26:42] about changing a man's heart and so if
[26:44] God could change the servant's heart it
[26:46] was more of a case to overthrow slavery
[26:49] than it would be to overthrow the
[26:50] institution without anyone's Hearts
[26:52] being overturn
[26:53] changed so I I know that I just uh kind
[26:58] of like a hornets nest I just kicked and
[27:01] so I'll probably drive home tonight just
[27:02] going what have I done and so I'm always
[27:05] open to more questions or as necessary
[27:07] clarifying myself but I believe that
[27:11] this The Scourge even the mark on
[27:14] America to use the Bible to justify
[27:16] owning somebody else and slavery that we
[27:19] we see now clearly that those things are
[27:21] wrong but some of the greatest Advocates
[27:25] and the motivators of change were men of
[27:28] God who preached the gospel and that
[27:31] became the ground swell of overturning
[27:35] an oppressive
[27:36] institution so as we read this and we if
[27:38] we read it to say slaves obey your
[27:42] owners what would this look like
[27:44] today right now if we would read it
[27:48] slaves obey your
[27:49] owners and we'd say well this is to
[27:51] Slaves who are owned by another human
[27:53] being we might just say well that
[27:56] doesn't apply
[27:59] but Paul is addressing an a reality a
[28:02] condition something that existed at the
[28:04] time and so if there is I can say it
[28:06] this way is there an original reality in
[28:09] our present
[28:10] context and I believe that there
[28:13] are ways that this can be applied Even
[28:16] in our employee employer relationship
[28:19] and the relationship we would have to
[28:20] others we have a duty these things could
[28:23] apply now let me bring this quote back
[28:25] into view again because we'd read it
[28:28] here recently and I want to use it again
[28:31] to uh kind of use some momentum of
[28:35] things we've talked about before and
[28:36] Christ is identified the same in all
[28:37] generations this is from the sermon we
[28:39] read in the beginning he says now
[28:41] remember don't forget our theme is and
[28:44] our text that Jesus Christ is the same
[28:48] yesterday today and forever he says now
[28:50] my text subject for tonight is Christ is
[28:53] identified the same in all
[28:55] generations and again if we begin to
[28:58] paint a picture in our mind of how he
[29:00] identifies himself there's a way that we
[29:02] could draw from a first century context
[29:04] and want to see him like that today and
[29:06] what we see in this statement and some
[29:08] of the other ones we used a couple weeks
[29:09] ago was that if that's what you're
[29:11] looking for you're going to miss them
[29:13] and there's actually very specific
[29:14] things that you might be looking for
[29:16] that if that's the next Jesus you see
[29:18] you're in big
[29:20] trouble right because you've missed it
[29:23] so he says now the Bible said he's the
[29:25] same yesterday today and forever and we
[29:27] want to know how he could be how we'd
[29:30] recognize him these are good questions
[29:33] if he's the same yesterday today and
[29:34] forever we want to know what he would
[29:36] look
[29:37] like and we' think well then could we
[29:40] just run some facial recognition AI on
[29:43] all the all the pictures and paintings
[29:46] and photographs in the world today and
[29:47] see if we could find them embedded in
[29:49] pictures and say he there he is right
[29:50] there there he is right there there he
[29:52] is right there all based upon facial
[29:53] features and certain uh uh uh things
[29:56] that he might look like he said what
[29:58] would he look like if he's here just as
[30:00] he was any other time then we'd like to
[30:02] know how he is recognized Among Us
[30:06] there's so many people have so many
[30:07] different ideas about him each one as an
[30:11] individual try to draw up our idea about
[30:14] Christ what he was what he looks like
[30:16] and how the psychologist has painted the
[30:19] picture like Hoffman's head of Christ at
[30:21] 33 and Salomon and different ones but we
[30:25] don't know he looked like that
[30:33] so we could never understand or what he
[30:35] looked like and by painting some picture
[30:39] this is again I I just want to refer
[30:41] back to what we were expressing before
[30:43] on this but people have come up with
[30:45] representations of what they think he
[30:47] looks like brother B says psychologist
[30:49] and Painters and these artists have
[30:51] painted pictures and if we take from
[30:53] that picture the reality of Christ that
[30:56] we're looking at the painting to form
[30:58] some sort of expectation and reality
[31:00] then this is not what he's going to look
[31:03] like and miss and not seeing this
[31:06] certain expression or this certain image
[31:07] we're going to miss them all together
[31:09] but he says we have to learn to know
[31:10] what he is this is what he arrives at he
[31:13] says we have to learn to know what he is
[31:16] what is he referring to not so much a
[31:18] robe not so much long hair not so much a
[31:20] beard but we're to learn to know his
[31:22] character his nature that this is how
[31:25] one this is how Christ would act this is
[31:28] how these are things that would form his
[31:30] character and his nature these are
[31:31] things that we would expect him to do in
[31:32] this end time and and what I know that
[31:35] each one of you as message students know
[31:37] is that brother bam used this in many
[31:40] ways to point to this sign of
[31:41] discernment and this gift to where there
[31:44] was a sign given where there's something
[31:46] Beyond man there's something Beyond
[31:47] brother brandham and he's Discerning
[31:49] thoughts and he's giving these H uh
[31:51] descriptions of things that only the
[31:53] Holy Spirit would know and that was a
[31:55] sign to declare the Supernatural is
[31:57] Among Us
[31:58] and I would say that that was Christ
[32:02] yesterday I'm just using it only in
[32:05] terms of chronology that what brother
[32:07] brandham was doing then we don't try to
[32:09] mimic and duplicate now to say see he's
[32:12] the same but we've got to find what our
[32:14] role is in the same pattern to say he
[32:17] did his part to awaken me to my part
[32:21] he's played his part now I come into the
[32:23] scene now I'm on the move now I want to
[32:26] know what he's like I want to learn what
[32:28] he is now so that I could be him
[32:32] now if we were to all be like brother
[32:35] brandham I got some things you could
[32:37] subscribe to and there's there's
[32:40] philosophies and ideologies and ways
[32:42] that we could try to just fit ourselves
[32:44] into this particular pattern brother
[32:46] Kevin that's what I was referring to
[32:48] when I said Indiana it was no no dig on
[32:50] Lafayette or anything like that it was
[32:53] not until later that my kids reminded me
[32:54] that you were visiting and I was like oh
[32:56] I really got him now that was was my
[32:58] shot but you're back here tonight so I'm
[32:59] going to go on Indiana all I want but no
[33:02] there's not a character of a Believer
[33:05] with the STS and hat the belt buckle
[33:06] that we're trying to fit into an image
[33:08] of but we want to know the character the
[33:11] character that is on
[33:13] display continuing to verse 11 of Titus
[33:16] Chapter 2 notice this it says for the
[33:18] grace of God that bringeth salvation
[33:20] hath appeared to all men when Grace
[33:23] appears it brings salvation and
[33:26] teaching when Grace appears the grace of
[33:28] God that bringeth salvation ha appeared
[33:30] to all men teaching us that so notice
[33:32] how it appears to produce a certain
[33:34] character Grace has appeared in this
[33:36] hour it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[33:38] there's this revealing of the Capstone
[33:40] this uh even one thing I thought for you
[33:42] to consider a little bit the
[33:43] intelligence has come the intelligence
[33:45] is being manifested not an artificial
[33:48] intelligence but a real genuine
[33:50] intelligence is being manifested and so
[33:52] the grace of God that brings full
[33:54] deliverance and full salvation has
[33:55] appeared and it's teaching and this
[33:58] teaching produces a character and and
[34:00] you could fit this into how he's
[34:02] teaching aged men aged women young men
[34:04] young women even servants when it
[34:06] appears it teaches us that denying
[34:08] ungodliness and worldly lust we should
[34:10] live soberly righteously and godly in
[34:12] this present world this is this applies
[34:14] for all when Grace appears it teaches us
[34:19] to reject
[34:20] ungodliness that we are to reject and to
[34:23] shun and have nothing to do with these
[34:24] worldly immoral desires
[34:28] the language that's being used that we
[34:29] should live sensible we should live
[34:31] upright and have Godly lives that there
[34:35] very deliberate in how that we live and
[34:37] how that we act that we have certain
[34:39] things that we measure things by and
[34:41] there's a certain consistency and we
[34:42] seem to be very per purposeful and it's
[34:45] so that it's reflecting this uh
[34:46] spiritually mature life the spiritual
[34:48] maturity and it says in this present
[34:53] World in other words the grace of God
[34:56] comes and when it does it teaches and
[34:58] it's going to teach you to deny
[35:00] worldliness to deny ungodliness to deny
[35:02] immorality to live sensibly and upright
[35:05] and godly to be deliberate to have a
[35:07] purpose and what we're doing is we're
[35:09] showing ourselves to be spiritually
[35:10] mature a and and that we're making
[35:13] decisions because in such a way to where
[35:15] we're and I'm drawing from something
[35:17] that was very very important last year
[35:19] is reducing things to Simplicity of
[35:22] what's valuable a a and identifying
[35:24] valuable and reducing it to that so that
[35:26] when you make a decision you view it
[35:28] through a certain
[35:29] parameter you narrow the scope of what
[35:32] you're looking at by frame and you have
[35:33] these boundaries and it makes it easier
[35:35] to make a decision and you realize oh
[35:37] does that it's a no it's a hard no if
[35:39] that's the case it's a no and then when
[35:41] the next situation comes up again you
[35:43] don't need to be like well well well no
[35:45] you know it's a no and you you give
[35:48] thought to decisions and examples I I
[35:50] can say this as a as a weakness that is
[35:53] my inconsistency and my lack of clarity
[35:55] as a father that causes more problems
[35:57] for my children than their own
[35:59] stubbornness or Disobedience and my
[36:01] children said okay you can have screen
[36:03] time
[36:04] tomorrow
[36:05] except right there's an inconsistency of
[36:08] the parents I I'm just saying for me you
[36:10] guys are doing great I'm learning from
[36:11] you that it's the lack of clarity it's
[36:13] the lack of a something to measure
[36:15] things by my son presses really good at
[36:18] trying to dig into it and find out what
[36:20] makes sense and what are the parameters
[36:23] and it's good for us to think about it
[36:24] it's like well I said not to do this and
[36:25] not to do that and what does it look
[36:26] like and how does it unfold and how it
[36:28] works this is how we ought to be growing
[36:30] and learning these things and all these
[36:32] things it says in this current age that
[36:36] we're in
[36:38] now not trying to draw ourselves back to
[36:40] Titus Chapter 2 in this day when Paul
[36:42] wrote this epistle to Titus and to try
[36:45] to figure contort ourselves to what it
[36:47] would look like in this traditional
[36:50] scenario uh anybody know what a Trad
[36:53] wife
[36:54] is I'm not asking for answers but these
[36:57] things that have come up in our popular
[36:59] culture and these certain images that
[37:01] people try to portray and now there's
[37:03] these women that by all appearances
[37:05] don't look traditional but they think
[37:07] they're acting traditional by behaving a
[37:09] certain way towards their husband and
[37:12] it's a very unscriptural traditional
[37:15] wife but yet they feel like they're
[37:17] giving this image and paying uh uh some
[37:20] service to a virtue and The Virtue is
[37:22] actually
[37:23] lacking because the the original reality
[37:26] is not being dis displayed in present
[37:28] context I can appreciate the the the the
[37:31] desire to take something that is
[37:32] scriptural and represent it in present
[37:34] context but they've moved so many other
[37:37] barriers and or boundaries and mov so
[37:39] many other things to where it doesn't
[37:42] translate and so instead of just
[37:44] rejecting Titus Chapter 2 wholesale or
[37:48] uh uh or trying to go back and live in
[37:51] Titus Chapter 2 I want an original
[37:53] reality in the present
[37:55] context as an aged who's getting ready
[37:58] to turn 50 I want to know what that
[37:59] looks like and I realize as I judge
[38:01] Myself by it that there's a lot of ways
[38:03] I joke around there's a lot of things
[38:04] that I maybe pay a little bit of
[38:06] attention to or wink wink nudge nudge or
[38:08] even sometimes when you're just a little
[38:09] bit H uh cutting it up with the kids
[38:12] real no one would look at me and guess
[38:13] how old I am and he realized there's
[38:16] maybe things that you could be more
[38:17] mature in things you could be a little
[38:18] bit more stable in and that's how it
[38:21] speaks these things I want to be a
[38:23] reflection of Christ in the present age
[38:25] I live in now and I like oh well that's
[38:27] just oldfashioned that's just this
[38:28] that's Titus Chapter 2 or that's just
[38:30] the 50s that's just the 60s what does it
[38:32] look like
[38:34] today in the sermon looking for Jesus I
[38:37] thought that was such a good title he
[38:38] preaches it in 1954 he says Where would
[38:41] he be I don't believe I've provided the
[38:43] statement I think the next slide is
[38:45] Titus 213 right so he says Where would
[38:48] he
[38:49] be out in the great shining lights no he
[38:54] would be amongst the
[38:55] humble the common people heard him
[38:57] gladly said the scripture when you think
[39:00] about the image of Christ and how we use
[39:04] that scripture on Sunday he was amongst
[39:05] the common people there's
[39:08] this and and I think that there's
[39:12] a
[39:13] well it's just it's difficult for me to
[39:16] express it and I hope that I'm just
[39:17] doing it piece by piece by
[39:19] piece in no way am I suggesting that
[39:23] well the best way we could be uh a
[39:25] witness is in Vegas you catch my drift
[39:28] right let's just go to Nevada where all
[39:29] everything's legal and let's just kind
[39:31] of be amongst them and show them that
[39:33] there's a I mean there's a there's a
[39:35] good way to get high or whatever or be a
[39:37] glutton and just just try to identify
[39:38] ourselves with the Sinners as a way of s
[39:40] I'm fulfilling the scripture that's not
[39:42] it right that that that's not that's not
[39:45] what the scripture is advocating for but
[39:47] if we turn that around there's a way
[39:49] that we're if we're not being very clear
[39:52] in our messaging I mean kind of there's
[39:54] this dog whistle so to speak of
[39:58] being so
[40:00] cultish and so
[40:02] Elite to where there's this hard
[40:04] division and there's absolutely zero way
[40:06] you can testify zero way you can be a
[40:09] witness zero way that anyone's everever
[40:11] going to know what Christ is because you
[40:14] can't have anything to do with it
[40:16] whatsoever at all and there's like this
[40:19] top down hierarchy which forbids certain
[40:21] things and doesn't allow certain things
[40:23] to where we're just kind of like all
[40:24] dumb driven cattle I got to go to this
[40:26] church thing I got go that church think
[40:27] I got to do this got to do that can't
[40:28] have my family here can't do this can't
[40:29] do that and so the light's never being
[40:32] expressed because we kind of put force
[40:34] it into this image that's not even a
[40:37] scriptural one and we lose the original
[40:39] reality uh because we can't even regard
[40:42] the per present context so he's saying
[40:45] where would he be he'd be humble he'd be
[40:47] amongst the common
[40:48] people now again it's saying that
[40:51] there's some traversing through the
[40:54] world there's some living a life and
[40:56] having a job
[40:57] and and sending your kids to school
[40:59] there's certain things that we just do
[41:01] this is what humans do that it's not
[41:03] advocating for finding the the most
[41:05] temperate climate in good soil living
[41:08] off the grid planting your food and
[41:10] eating it and if we all somehow everyone
[41:12] who had the holy goh somehow could
[41:14] successfully relocate to that place
[41:17] there'd be no more
[41:18] salvation unless somebody just fell out
[41:21] of the
[41:23] sky and they land they survive and we're
[41:26] like oh my goodness what's going on here
[41:27] and they're like go I've never seen
[41:28] people like this I want to be saved how
[41:31] would the gospel be preached how would
[41:32] it ever contact a
[41:34] life where would he be amongst the
[41:36] common people they heard him gladly the
[41:38] priest and so forth wouldn't listen to
[41:40] him so here's that we're more righteous
[41:42] we're more holy this uh this construct
[41:45] that they had he said they had their own
[41:48] ideas their own churches their own setup
[41:50] so they didn't listen what kind of man
[41:52] would he be then would he be a real
[41:55] overbearing sort of person no I don't
[41:58] believe he would so all the overbearing
[42:01] people he say well write that down need
[42:04] to pray for that I believe he'd be a
[42:06] kind person and I believe he'd be so
[42:09] kind that when he spoke to you you'd
[42:10] know it was him speaking and yet he'd be
[42:12] firm enough till you would know
[42:14] that and kind of it's to me it's a
[42:16] little bit of a fragment but as he
[42:18] described what he looked like in those
[42:19] Visions when he saw him he said just
[42:21] like you'd want to cry when he spoke he
[42:24] had such tenderness and such meekness
[42:25] and kindness but you saw all power was
[42:27] in him and he says like when he platted
[42:30] the ropes together and beat them out of
[42:31] the temple for doing something wrong he
[42:33] says no I don't believe no artist could
[42:36] paint his
[42:39] character he's describing in another
[42:41] place he said there's just too many
[42:42] characteristics that an artist's brush
[42:45] could never
[42:47] catch the seed is not air with a shook
[42:49] he said his face had characters that no
[42:51] artist could draw or paint they could
[42:53] not do it and characters could never be
[42:55] caught by an artist
[42:58] notice just how rich that makes it
[43:01] there's something about you can't just
[43:03] kind take a a a
[43:05] Polaroid just take a picture just have a
[43:08] profile picture just have an Instagram
[43:10] account just put something online listen
[43:12] the most effective witness of this
[43:14] church is not our
[43:16] sermons it's not trying to come up with
[43:18] a way to use certain tools to produce
[43:20] you know short content that expresses a
[43:22] lot I mean anymore that you could have
[43:25] me up there talking in front of a green
[43:26] screen I it's not even me or my voice
[43:28] it's just a learned model and it can say
[43:30] all sorts of nice flowery things and
[43:32] really really profound things and we
[43:34] could start a podcast there's a lot of
[43:35] stuff we could do from a social media
[43:37] context but that can only go so far the
[43:39] most effective witness is when you are
[43:42] living in 3D in
[43:45] reality in a way that
[43:48] artist natural means and natural media
[43:51] can never express but God as an artist
[43:55] knows just how to paint it
[43:58] we should live Godly in this present
[44:02] World an original reality of the way
[44:06] that Christ is the same yesterday today
[44:08] and forever we should be living it
[44:10] today verse 13 looking for that blessed
[44:13] hope and the Glorious appearing of the
[44:15] great God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[44:17] who gave himself for us that he might
[44:19] redeem us from all iniquity and
[44:21] purifying unto himself a peculiar people
[44:27] there's a lot of things that brother
[44:28] badam says in these God identifying
[44:31] himself by his characteristics in all
[44:32] ages and those sermons where he brings
[44:35] out how that his rep the way that he
[44:37] expresses himself confounds the
[44:40] norm that it it's against kind of the
[44:43] the original way of thinking the
[44:44] original way of doing things so to say
[44:47] that it's the original reality in
[44:48] present context doesn't mean that we
[44:50] blend in as Comm
[44:51] Millions doesn't mean that it just
[44:54] completely goes unnoticed because we've
[44:56] been able to camou ourselves in the
[44:58] world just like the story that's told
[45:00] about the boy that went to the logging
[45:01] camp and the mother was really worried
[45:03] what they would do to him and they found
[45:04] out that he was a Christian and he comes
[45:05] back and she says oh he comes like oh
[45:07] man what did they do to you how did they
[45:09] treat say oh uh it was great mama and
[45:12] she said well what did they do when they
[45:13] found out you're a Christian said oh
[45:14] they never found
[45:15] out and so that's not the that's not
[45:17] what we're trying to do is make our way
[45:19] through this world without anyone ever
[45:20] be going thinking that's
[45:23] different the original reality in the
[45:25] present context
[45:28] is enough in itself than us trying to be
[45:31] weird or different remember the
[45:32] teachings in the seven seal Seven Seals
[45:35] if us trying to be weird if we just
[45:38] Express the original reality in the
[45:39] present context it's going to be
[45:40] different enough without us
[45:43] trying peculiar people zealous of Good
[45:47] Works our Zeal should be towards
[45:49] righteousness and Holiness and
[45:50] uprightness we should be pattering after
[45:52] these things that Paul said to Titus
[45:54] that aged men should be so as young men
[45:57] we're learning to be that as young women
[45:59] we're learning to be that that we ought
[46:00] to have this Zeal for good works and so
[46:04] this is the admonition to the teacher
[46:05] these things speak and exhort and rebuke
[46:07] with all authority let no man despise
[46:10] thee and this is our commission today to
[46:13] fathers and the homes it's a commission
[46:15] to to parents and grandparents it's a
[46:17] commission to us as a church that we are
[46:19] modeling ourselves and what we're trying
[46:21] to produce after these scriptures that
[46:23] we want people to be uh uh images of
[46:26] Christ
[46:27] as
[46:29] individuals and it says A peculiar
[46:32] people they are
[46:38] unique I think I've mentioned this
[46:41] before but with the proliferation of
[46:42] media and just how I could be listening
[46:46] to something today in Phoenix that
[46:50] people all around the world are
[46:51] listening to at the same exact moment we
[46:54] can enjoy things instantaneously at the
[46:56] same time and so in doing so there
[46:59] there's a har there's a I guess you
[47:01] could say it's a harmonizing um I've
[47:03] been studying on the places where
[47:04] brother BR talks about the symphony
[47:06] calls it a sympathy and he uses Peter
[47:08] and the Wolf so there's and some sermons
[47:09] there's I got a list of sermons if you
[47:11] want to listen to those for that
[47:12] particular line of thinking on a
[47:14] symphony we're all being conducted and
[47:16] brother bam talks about those
[47:17] disconcordant parts or those parts of
[47:19] the unbeliever and he says they have a
[47:21] part in the symphony and so there is a
[47:23] Harmony or there's these certain things
[47:25] I think it's even some worldly artists
[47:28] say that you need those um or it's like
[47:31] watching a movie with no bad guy or
[47:32] eating cottage cheese and so there's a
[47:35] certain thing to where those bad things
[47:37] create this
[47:38] contrast and they have their part so
[47:41] there is kind of this harmonizing this
[47:43] uniting through these worldly means and
[47:47] in doing so everyone starts to sound the
[47:49] same and look the
[47:50] same and there is a little bit of a
[47:54] that's misleading because the world is
[47:57] going to unite under the wrong
[47:58] thing and so I know for Brother John
[48:01] you've been seeing this in my slides for
[48:03] a few weeks and I'm finally getting to
[48:05] it but in the sermon the identified
[48:08] Masterpiece of God and I have a couple
[48:10] slides here at the beginning without the
[48:12] words but I'm just want you to look at
[48:13] this Starry Night Over the rone uh by
[48:16] Van go in heaven we look at the
[48:18] celestial bodies the Bible says that
[48:21] even one star differs from the other
[48:23] there is Sirius and the different ones
[48:24] and Mars and Jupiter all those different
[48:27] ones they're different one from the
[48:30] other the sun is different from the Moon
[48:32] and the moon from the
[48:34] stars look at that uh the art just a
[48:38] painter is trying to capture what this
[48:40] the night looks like and and my son
[48:43] Elliott sent me an excerpt from his a
[48:45] philosophy class today his college
[48:46] philosophy course and I was like I could
[48:49] just take these to the pulpit and not
[48:50] preach philosophy but on the context of
[48:53] Art and the and how that God there's
[48:55] these theories and philosophy of these
[48:57] original forms that's the god I think
[48:59] the example that was used was a bed
[49:01] there's a a bed in heaven that that is
[49:04] the perfect bed and then the the
[49:06] carpenter can make a bed that's like
[49:09] that and so that's just one level
[49:11] removed and then someone could paint the
[49:12] bed and that's a a a a replication of a
[49:16] replication of the original kind of
[49:19] getting some extra credit for philosophy
[49:20] now and what we see here and many people
[49:23] are mesmerized by this would paid
[49:25] Millions for it and I think it's a it's
[49:27] an engaging work of art and the way that
[49:29] it's captured and the way that it's
[49:30] painted but you realize this is just
[49:32] only telling part of the story and
[49:35] there's so many different stars and
[49:37] different uh uh distances away and
[49:39] different purposes and uses and brother
[49:41] B say they all differ from one
[49:43] another and then he says the same thing
[49:45] about angels and there are angels such
[49:48] as their seraphim and cherubims and the
[49:50] angels and great angels in
[49:53] degrees and even in the new world to
[49:56] come the king of the earth bring their
[49:57] AR honor into the
[50:00] city there's there's God's always had
[50:05] degrees he's had Parts he's had
[50:09] roles I there was brother Micah and I
[50:11] were fellowshipping early today on the
[50:13] phone and how
[50:15] that one thing that has meant a lot to
[50:18] me is to understand that to God the
[50:20] process is just as important as the
[50:22] product cuz if the product was all he
[50:25] was interested in it'd be in the the
[50:26] beginning God created the heavens and
[50:28] the Earth new and we lived and reigned
[50:32] forever right boom there we'd be we have
[50:36] Genesis 1 and and the end of the Bible
[50:38] that's it we would be ruling and
[50:40] reigning Eighth Day forever and but
[50:42] since God is a god values the process
[50:45] just as much as the
[50:46] product he has created in these degrees
[50:49] and in these channels and these
[50:50] different parts and these different
[50:52] means to where it's not just one Mass
[50:55] blob but God is a God of positions and
[50:58] purposes and
[50:59] uses and he says even in heaven the new
[51:02] heavens and new earth there's going to
[51:04] be some order or symmetry to it he says
[51:07] we're always going to be that
[51:10] way because
[51:13] God is not a Sears and robu Harmony
[51:17] House anybody know what a Sears and robu
[51:19] Harmony House is anybody we got some
[51:22] hands
[51:23] raised raise them high let's just see
[51:25] who knows what a ser anybody have a
[51:27] furniture set that was a Harmony House
[51:29] and maybe a dish set anybody here
[51:31] register with Sears and robu for their
[51:34] wedding I went and just researched it a
[51:36] Sears and Rob Buck Harmony House and it
[51:37] was this line that they came out with I
[51:39] found a lot of different ads I'd had
[51:41] some uh a slide maybe to show it but I
[51:42] realized in the end I didn't like the
[51:44] art so I just kept it out because says
[51:47] God is not a Sears and robot Harmony
[51:49] House where we're trying to create a
[51:52] particular
[51:53] image that is you you can get everything
[51:56] want for your entire house from this
[51:58] line and everything's going to match
[51:59] everything's going to look the same and
[52:00] it's a Harmony House sounds like one of
[52:02] these modern uh YouTube uh houses or Tik
[52:07] Tok houses or whatever the Sears and
[52:09] robu Harmony House he says that's not
[52:12] how God is he says he is a god of
[52:15] variety he makes one one way and one
[52:19] another but we must serve him in the way
[52:21] that God made us and be glad and stay
[52:25] behind his
[52:28] word just as there are glories to the
[52:31] stars and there's a glory to the angels
[52:33] the differences among us do not remove
[52:35] the glory it accentuates and complement
[52:38] the glory through Force unity and the
[52:41] wrong image we could all start to look
[52:42] the same and talk the same and act the
[52:44] same and that would do a disservice to a
[52:46] god who's a god of variety and how that
[52:49] God wants to express himself not through
[52:50] a Sears and Rob book Harmony House not
[52:52] through a limited catalog where we're
[52:54] all buying the same things wearing the
[52:55] same things what doing all the same
[52:57] things but rather there's a character
[52:59] that we all can exhibit through our
[53:00] varied uh works and callings and
[53:03] Recreations and that there's a way that
[53:05] we can live and express the original
[53:08] reality in your present
[53:10] context as you were called to rub
[53:12] shoulders with people that I will never
[53:13] come in contact with as you are called
[53:15] to dress and act a way as a sister that
[53:17] a man will not be called and act a
[53:19] certain way that there is a character
[53:20] that's to be expressed and I and I would
[53:23] say this with great uh uh force and
[53:25] warning that there is that expression
[53:27] that is just outright foolish and
[53:29] perverted that we can't make the excuse
[53:32] of
[53:33] variety we recognize that because we've
[53:36] got to stay behind the word and that's
[53:39] the way God did
[53:42] it no that was me that's the way God did
[53:44] it but when we find that out that the
[53:47] enemy got through that word to this the
[53:50] handywork of God he marred it he got he
[53:53] caused the woman to leave the frame
[53:56] to leave the
[53:59] context and that's exactly what he's
[54:01] doing now he's slipping through that
[54:03] handiwork Brothers you can come to your
[54:05] instruments the enemy is trying to make
[54:06] us a World Council of churches why men
[54:09] can even agree with one another how are
[54:11] we going to make a whole world agree
[54:12] with a man he says we got one we must
[54:15] keep in harmony with that's
[54:18] God that's who we're in harmony with and
[54:21] if we're in harmony with him in our part
[54:23] and our role it's going to naturally
[54:26] harmonize with somebody else whoever
[54:29] else the ones that we bump into are the
[54:30] ones who've got their own idea their own
[54:32] agenda their own
[54:33] program we
[54:35] must keep in harmony with
[54:38] God and in the beginning was the word
[54:40] the word was with God and the Word was
[54:42] God and the word remains God and always
[54:43] will be God because God is the word and
[54:45] the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[54:47] Us in the person of the Son of
[54:51] God to speak of Harmony at the very
[54:56] least would imply two parts would it
[55:00] not okay good I'm just going
[55:03] to Harmony would imply some sort of
[55:06] different
[55:08] parts two things that maybe don't match
[55:10] up or
[55:12] agree or or separate entities Harmony
[55:15] implies that these different parts and
[55:17] roles are in
[55:18] agreement we could use scriptures we
[55:20] don't all have the same calling we don't
[55:21] all have the same office we don't have
[55:23] all have the same Administration but
[55:24] it's the same spirit
[55:27] and in order for there to be Harmony
[55:28] that requires even with vocal vocal
[55:31] Harmony in instruments it requires
[55:33] Integrity to your tone it it requires a
[55:36] consonant it requires Clarity there's
[55:38] certain things that you must have each
[55:40] one in their own part and one voice
[55:42] whether it be instruments or voices
[55:44] there got to be that order that
[55:45] proportion that
[55:46] symmetry that's a in a musical sense one
[55:50] of the greatest challenges even in
[55:52] church music is that not everybody tries
[55:54] to play the same exact way everyone's on
[55:57] the melody everyone's doing this
[55:58] everyone's doing the same thing and what
[55:59] does it create a just a
[56:02] Roar and it it's not a sound system
[56:04] problem it's my turn to lecture the
[56:06] musicians tonight wait hold on uh they
[56:09] it creates a war it's not a sound system
[56:12] problem it's the fact that each one
[56:13] doesn't know their
[56:14] Lane there's a way that they can play
[56:16] their instrument the right way that
[56:18] compliments the next guy and the next
[56:19] guy and not everyone has to be the show
[56:21] but they all kind of blend together the
[56:23] tightest Harmony almost becomes
[56:25] indistinguishable and it just starts to
[56:27] resonate in a way it's like
[56:29] wow and if you wanted to drill down in
[56:32] all the different ways that you could
[56:33] have these notes and these
[56:35] harmonizations it's a that mathematical
[56:38] principle of
[56:41] Harmony and if God's wanting to express
[56:43] himself he says we have to be in harmony
[56:45] with God so you're not God but you're a
[56:48] part of God and being a part of God and
[56:51] you being a part of God and you being a
[56:53] part of God there's a way that we all
[56:54] have to harmonize together together with
[56:56] God and in doing so create a beautiful
[56:59] picture together none of us can do it on
[57:01] our own but together we can begin to
[57:04] create a a
[57:06] symphony together we we we create a
[57:08] picture and that's why we don't we don't
[57:10] want to just be uh Mavericks off doing
[57:13] our own thing but there's power in the
[57:14] fellowship that we have with one another
[57:16] there's ways that maybe together we can
[57:17] be a witness to other people as brothers
[57:19] there's ways that are The Homeschool
[57:21] families when they get together there's
[57:22] no doubt there's a witness there when
[57:24] you all go out together and you have
[57:26] people over you're a witness in your
[57:28] neighborhood and at the park there's a
[57:29] way that that voice begins to blend and
[57:31] harmonize and people will see like this
[57:34] is a beautiful
[57:35] picture God wants to express himself so
[57:38] there must be if God's a god of variety
[57:40] and he himself is a god of these many
[57:42] lights in this great Fountain there must
[57:44] be some distinct attributes that need to
[57:46] be honored this is what Paul is
[57:48] expressing to Titus men be men women be
[57:50] women young men young women be a certain
[57:52] way there's got to be a way that we can
[57:54] by our characteristics and by our nature
[57:56] Express these certain distinct
[57:58] attributes that give God that gives God
[58:00] honor that's both in leading and
[58:03] following both in our that behavior that
[58:05] we have as men and the way behavior that
[58:07] we have as women that there's a proper
[58:09] form we're having the discussion today
[58:12] as a family on you know the objective
[58:15] things and subjective things I believe
[58:17] that there is this objective beauty of
[58:19] the scripture that God wants us to
[58:21] portray and not everybody's going to
[58:23] think it's beautiful but those that God
[58:26] has given some taste for that they're
[58:31] going to see it and they're going to
[58:32] love it and they're going to want to be
[58:34] part of that
[58:35] picture spent a little bit of time just
[58:37] trying to create this graphic that is
[58:39] here accompanied this last
[58:43] slide and it takes the Rich Young Ruler
[58:45] from Hoffman's Christ at 33 and it
[58:48] doesn't put him in a robe and a a
[58:50] ruler's hat and fine linen and lavish
[58:54] clothing it's very Stark distinct from
[58:56] the way that Jesus is dressed when you
[58:57] look at the original but just a guy a
[59:00] young man in a suit and
[59:03] tie who's
[59:05] been the original reality is confronting
[59:08] him and I use the picture of the classic
[59:10] picture of Christ to say he's the same
[59:12] yesterday today and forever but it's not
[59:14] the robe it's not the hair it's not the
[59:16] hands but it's
[59:18] Christ showing
[59:20] you showing you in his word what it
[59:23] means and here a modern day man Rich
[59:26] Young Ruler is in deep contemplation
[59:30] about the price and the
[59:33] cost there is a present day context that
[59:36] we're to live in to be Godly in this
[59:40] present
[59:44] World God help us to do it and to do it
[59:47] we will need his help let's pray today
[59:50] today you can stand with me thank you
[59:52] for your patience
[59:53] tonight I feel good having delivered
[59:56] this and my burden on these things so
[59:59] thank you let's bow our heads in a word
[1:00:01] of prayer Heavenly Father tonight Lord
[1:00:03] as we close this service and we just sum
[1:00:06] up these things that we've shared with
[1:00:07] the prayer of blessing upon the
[1:00:09] people and by way of challenge to the
[1:00:11] people that if there be anything in
[1:00:12] their hearts that you need to address
[1:00:15] Lord we Avail ourselves to you and we
[1:00:17] open up our minds and our hearts and
[1:00:18] deal with us Lord in a deep
[1:00:21] way Lord in fellowshipping with someone
[1:00:23] this week who
[1:00:24] expressed how in their 50s they know
[1:00:28] that they're lacking that that seal and
[1:00:30] that conversion and they're despairing
[1:00:32] Lord
[1:00:34] and and you can see that there's a
[1:00:36] lifetime of
[1:00:39] confusion and Lord It's I think it just
[1:00:43] becomes such
[1:00:44] a unmovable object in our
[1:00:50] minds and Lord if we could just push
[1:00:53] everything else away and just look to
[1:00:56] You In This Moment the
[1:00:58] word and say that yes what I'm asking
[1:01:01] for is this experience or what I'm
[1:01:03] asking for is this but Lord this is what
[1:01:05] I need and I come to you and I ask you
[1:01:07] for it and I believe for
[1:01:10] it I want you to be real I want you to
[1:01:12] be a
[1:01:14] reality Lord if you could just make
[1:01:16] yourself known to us and identify
[1:01:19] yourself to us through your presence and
[1:01:21] through your word and your interest in
[1:01:23] us then Lord may we just grab a hold of
[1:01:25] that that expression and that
[1:01:26] manifestation to say Lord I know you're
[1:01:28] mindful I believe that you're real that
[1:01:30] there's an original reality that can
[1:01:32] Dawn on my
[1:01:34] life and Lord we yield to you tonight as
[1:01:37] clay and you the Potter we yield as your
[1:01:41] creation Lord and you the
[1:01:44] Creator to make us what we ought to be
[1:01:46] in the context of the world that we're
[1:01:48] living in
[1:01:49] now not to make us like the world but in
[1:01:52] the world make us
[1:01:54] lights Lord we need your Grace we need
[1:01:56] your help so I pray for the people
[1:01:58] tonight I know father that for
[1:02:01] me in Fellowship I realize it's
[1:02:04] repetition repetition repetition of the
[1:02:06] same
[1:02:07] things but Lord I'm hoping that the
[1:02:09] foundation is getting stronger and
[1:02:10] stronger and stronger that we can all
[1:02:13] have patience for one another as we get
[1:02:15] caught up together in this Foundation of
[1:02:18] you Christ revealed to us as individuals
[1:02:22] the sure Foundation upon which the
[1:02:25] remainder of Our Lives in this church
[1:02:26] can be
[1:02:27] built Lord I pray that you bless your
[1:02:29] people that are here may they experience
[1:02:31] this Divine Healing May the word that's
[1:02:33] discern their hearts today not by a gift
[1:02:36] of discernment on display of the on the
[1:02:38] platform as it was yesterday but the
[1:02:41] word sharper than a two-edged sword now
[1:02:43] still yet Discerning people's lives as
[1:02:46] the gospel's preached I pray that that
[1:02:49] would awaken us to a reality Beyond
[1:02:51] ourselves an original reality in present
[1:02:53] day context we ask all all these things
[1:02:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] amen
