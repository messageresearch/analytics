[0:00] as you can see from the slide that we're
[0:02] going to be continuing on the subject of
[0:04] the Kingdom
[0:05] and I'd like to read a statement from
[0:07] the church age book and this I will kind
[0:10] of capture a lot of different thoughts
[0:12] that we were using in the last the first
[0:13] service on worldly kingdoms on Sunday
[0:16] but it's also wanting to re-emphasize
[0:19] the whole point and kind of looking at
[0:20] this subject I don't ever want to
[0:22] approach a subject in such a way to
[0:23] where you feel it's more academic or
[0:25] historical lesson but if Jesus Christ is
[0:27] in every verse then we can see ourselves
[0:29] in every verse and so the real
[0:31] importance is to see what Christ means
[0:33] to us when we read our Bibles and we
[0:35] catch Revelation and so brother Branham
[0:37] is making some very
[0:39] um profound statements and you just find
[0:41] it's just throughout all these chapters
[0:43] in the church age book he's just using
[0:46] addressing this particular theme of
[0:48] sewing and reaping he says whatever seed
[0:50] started the church will come forth and
[0:52] be like the Original Seed because it is
[0:54] the same seed so there's the law of
[0:56] reproduction he says in these last days
[0:58] the true bride Church Christ's seed will
[1:02] come to The Headstone that's a maturity
[1:03] that's a fullness and she will be the
[1:06] Super Church a super race as she nears
[1:09] him so this is uh these are new
[1:11] Creations or new creatures this is this
[1:14] is I would say the kingdom this is
[1:16] representative of the Kingdom
[1:17] and he says they in the bride will be so
[1:20] much like him that they will be they
[1:22] will even be in his very image
[1:24] this is in order to be United with him
[1:27] they will be one now I'm going to say it
[1:30] now and maybe not with any kind of
[1:33] background or explanation to it but this
[1:36] prerequisite in order for them to be
[1:38] United is they have to be the same
[1:40] and you kind of catch that it can't he
[1:42] says the seed that started is a seed
[1:44] that's going to come up and he said it's
[1:46] going to be Christ seed and so if Christ
[1:47] is going to unite it has to be his seed
[1:49] and he says it has to be the same it'll
[1:51] be the same seed and this is so that
[1:54] they can be United together they will be
[1:56] one they will be the very manifestation
[1:59] of the word of the Living God
[2:02] we know in many different places uh he's
[2:04] saying that you are the message of the
[2:06] hour you are the reflection of it you
[2:08] are the word made flesh and he says
[2:10] denominations and this is uh as you're
[2:14] reading and tracking what he's saying is
[2:15] it's addressing maybe the error in the
[2:17] pergamian church age this is uh this is
[2:21] applicable now when he speaks of
[2:23] denominations remember denominationalism
[2:25] is anything that's mixed
[2:27] and I think it's good for us to think
[2:30] that way and saying oh does it say
[2:31] Baptist does it say Presbyterian is it a
[2:33] denomination and then draw the
[2:35] conclusion that it's mixed but if you
[2:37] see anything mixed that's
[2:39] denominationalism and so it doesn't
[2:40] matter if they call themselves
[2:41] independent or message if it's mixed
[2:44] that's denominationalism and so it says
[2:47] they will be the very manifestation of
[2:48] the word of the Living God if I could
[2:50] say but he says denominations cannot
[2:52] produce this wrong seed so whatever seed
[2:55] it is it'll come forth he says they will
[2:57] produce their Creeds and their dogmas
[2:59] mixed with the word this mongrelizing
[3:02] brings forth a hybrid product now that's
[3:06] the that's the focus tonight is that the
[3:10] hybriding or this Mongrel eye that's
[3:12] kind of a kind of an aggravating word
[3:14] mongrelizing it has maybe some harsh
[3:16] sounds to it and it is a uh it kind of
[3:20] is uh maybe maybe a term that we don't
[3:22] use very often now but this mongrelizing
[3:25] brings forth he says a high bridge
[3:27] product now as we continue in the
[3:30] subject of worldly kingdoms I'm wanting
[3:32] to associate that hybrid product with
[3:34] the worldly kingdoms what we see in the
[3:36] world today uh what we call worldliness
[3:39] and that all that is in the world is the
[3:40] lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh
[3:42] and the pride of life and all those
[3:43] things as we look at this in part two of
[3:45] worldly kingdoms we're wanting to
[3:48] identify where it began
[3:50] and in by examining the origins of the
[3:53] kingdoms of this world I'm hoping that
[3:55] we can Mark out more clearly what is the
[3:58] kingdom because there's there's uh
[4:01] things that maybe we and I guess I'll
[4:03] just address it this way that divide
[4:04] that we've come up with well uh we were
[4:07] living here in Earth and we're making
[4:08] decisions about whether or not we're
[4:09] going to spend eternity in Hell or
[4:11] whether we're going to uh spend eternity
[4:12] in heaven and I believe that's the wrong
[4:15] way of looking at it because I I feel
[4:17] impressed to identify the original and
[4:20] recognize what the original is the
[4:21] original spoken word the way that God
[4:23] originally set it up take Genesis 1
[4:24] Genesis 2 as we have and frame out that
[4:27] picture where God represented Perfection
[4:28] but then be able to look at the
[4:30] perversion so that we can understand the
[4:33] future home we can understand what
[4:35] eternity is going to be and recognize
[4:37] where the seeds of the Kingdom were
[4:39] planted and what that's going to be one
[4:41] day in eternity and what it is we're
[4:44] living for and what it is we're doing on
[4:45] Earth right now so that we're we're Mark
[4:48] so we're recognizing identifying the
[4:50] worldly kingdoms to make the kingdom
[4:52] more pronounced but we need to recognize
[4:54] what the original was because that's
[4:55] going to be what survives that's what
[4:57] we're we're heirs to and in Genesis
[5:00] chapter one excuse me Genesis chapter 3
[5:02] according to the parable of Matthew 13
[5:04] we see the wicked one going and sowing
[5:07] seeds of all the worldly kingdoms and
[5:10] what the what the devil was able to
[5:12] accomplish is he poisoned the nature of
[5:14] humanity poisoned the nature of man uh
[5:17] by sowing his seed and that's what Cain
[5:20] began to bring forth is a poison nature
[5:22] in the sermon God's power to transform
[5:25] ER says to make this point
[5:28] I wanted to give you my analysis of what
[5:30] Satan done in Eden and I like that he
[5:32] wants to give you his analysis and he's
[5:35] analyzing uh what took place and he's
[5:37] going to set forth as a prophet what
[5:38] happened and he summarizes it this way
[5:40] sprayed horrible poison spray
[5:43] this is what he's done and I in the way
[5:46] that he describes it and this is going
[5:49] back to what we were saying over and
[5:50] over again on Sunday Satan himself does
[5:52] not have a seed
[5:53] uh but he is if we say he's a power he's
[5:56] an influencer but he does not have a
[5:58] seed he cannot create co-equal with god
[6:00] brother bear said accepting the ability
[6:01] to create he doesn't have the power of
[6:03] life in him is actually the power of
[6:05] death and so he's wanting to uh he's
[6:08] wanting to have access to life and so
[6:11] it's not that he had a seed and he sowed
[6:13] it but he took seeds that God had
[6:15] already made
[6:17] and he's and brother man's using this as
[6:19] an in a sense of an allegory or a type
[6:23] that he sprayed the seed with poison he
[6:26] poisons the mind of the serpent he uses
[6:28] that serpent to influence the woman and
[6:30] so he says it's sprayed a horrible
[6:32] poison spray this is what he does in
[6:34] Eden would you like to know what that
[6:36] spray was I can tell you I got the
[6:39] formula of it two words unbelief which
[6:42] is contrary to Faith sprayed unbelief
[6:45] doubt so this is what he sprays in the
[6:48] beginning is unbelief and he sprays
[6:51] doubt and by spraying unbelief and doubt
[6:53] and in in in indwelling the serpent
[6:56] sowing the seeds of discrepancy just
[6:59] through preaching the word of God and
[7:01] misrepresenting it he's using the spray
[7:03] of unbelief and doubt then now watch
[7:06] what brother Branham says and science
[7:08] filled its place
[7:10] so as unbelief and doubt tankered
[7:13] something and rotted something and
[7:15] caused it to fall away he says where the
[7:16] cavity is that went into the seed Satan
[7:20] filled that cavity with knowledge and
[7:21] Science and civilization and it's
[7:23] deformed the whole entire creation of
[7:27] God
[7:27] the devil cannot create it he can only
[7:29] pervert it he cannot transform it he can
[7:32] only deform it so he is used in the
[7:35] beginning the tactics of unbelief and
[7:36] doubt you'll find that he still works
[7:38] that way with you anytime something's
[7:40] working through fear or unbelief or
[7:42] doubt you can recognize that as the
[7:43] tactic of the enemy and so he creates a
[7:46] deformity which is through this spray of
[7:49] unbelief and we were drawing and we you
[7:52] connected this in God's power to
[7:54] transform into things brother Adam's
[7:55] saying and there and also this sermon
[7:58] seated discrepancy how that the tares
[8:00] are what the efforts of the wicked one
[8:03] brought forth as the enemy It Goes Forth
[8:06] to so then the Bible says is the devil
[8:09] so what he does is he sprays this poison
[8:11] he causes these seeds to mix and it
[8:13] brings for Tears which are a poisonous
[8:16] weed
[8:17] we saw where it's called even by the
[8:19] horticulturalists the wheat's evil twin
[8:22] so it's a it's a it's something that
[8:24] looks just like the wheat before full
[8:26] maturity oh it through different stages
[8:28] it looks like a plant that maybe would
[8:30] be good for food but if you eat it that
[8:32] grain uh and that seed will can
[8:34] intoxicate you impair your judgment your
[8:36] discernment eventually causing death
[8:38] that's what's represented by the tear
[8:41] it's a mimic weed it's a stowaway seed
[8:43] something is we read to where it's kind
[8:46] of in that middle ground they say to
[8:47] where the the tares are not exactly
[8:50] domesticated but they're not exactly
[8:51] wild they're not tamed or they truly
[8:54] well there's something that is sown into
[8:56] the rest of the grain
[8:58] depends upon the efforts of domesticated
[9:01] crops but yet has a wild nature to it
[9:04] and so this is what the tares represent
[9:07] even in the world today and these
[9:09] worldly kingdoms as we were saying
[9:10] Sunday they exist because of Satan's
[9:12] ambition as RAM said Satan wanted to
[9:15] indwell man just as God did so Satan
[9:17] wanted access to humanity and he gained
[9:21] that access through the serpent by
[9:23] creating a hybrid product that he could
[9:25] then dwell in because there was this
[9:27] Affinity with animal nature
[9:30] we know he wanted to be worshiped as God
[9:32] and this is how he achieves it he used
[9:34] God's original seeds and mixed them
[9:36] right use God's original seeds and mix
[9:38] them to create something that he could
[9:40] access
[9:41] and what did it produce an evil twin
[9:44] produced an evil twin so those are the
[9:46] tares that you see that Satan allowed to
[9:49] be sowed into God's creation and just as
[9:53] Fellowship in on this and I think the
[9:55] the idea of setting forth the serpent
[9:58] just even saying serpent we all kind of
[10:00] go right we just kind of feel like ooh
[10:03] but when God created
[10:05] uh and we know that there's even a
[10:07] little bit of uh maybe it's not so much
[10:09] foreshadowing he's looking back as to
[10:11] why it's named The Serpent but yet as
[10:13] Adam would have given all these names to
[10:15] these beasts and it takes on a
[10:17] particular meaning and particular
[10:18] feeling we associate that because of how
[10:21] Satan used it right oh my how the how
[10:24] Satan used the serpent so it's hard to
[10:26] think that God would have actually
[10:28] caused that Beast to exist in a day of
[10:31] creation when he said it's good
[10:34] and be a part of that original so Satan
[10:36] that comes and takes a serpent that if
[10:38] he had just stayed in his Lane would
[10:40] have brought forth uh other other seed
[10:42] and would have had his place in God's
[10:44] Eden but yet Satan allows it to mix and
[10:46] in doing so it creates a hybrid product
[10:48] that's why Satan could influence Cain
[10:50] that's why the devil having entered into
[10:53] judas's heart is because God reserved
[10:55] the right for himself to dwell within
[10:58] his original creation man in his pure
[11:00] form
[11:01] and we find all that is in that in the
[11:03] church age book
[11:05] now if you look at Genesis chapter one
[11:06] this is where I I feel like I'm just
[11:08] kind of pausing uh tonight instead of
[11:11] getting further into the manifestation
[11:13] of the seat of discrepancy kind of see
[11:15] it in Cain and track the kingdoms of
[11:16] this world uh to the end I just felt
[11:19] impressed to look at Genesis chapter one
[11:22] and this this Dynamic of seed and it
[11:26] bringing forth life so Genesis chapter 1
[11:28] verses 11 and 12 it says and God said
[11:31] let the Earth bring forth grass the herb
[11:34] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[11:35] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[11:38] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[11:41] so so we know that God sowed first by
[11:43] the spoken word we've seen the message
[11:45] of the hour but the realm says there's
[11:46] seeds that are laying there in the earth
[11:48] and then now he's saying that these are
[11:51] to come forth there's maybe some more
[11:53] scriptures we could have read here even
[11:54] in the first two chapters
[11:56] that highlight this process and this
[11:58] principle but it says here in 12 in the
[12:00] Earth
[12:01] brought forth grass an herb yielding
[12:03] seed after his kind
[12:05] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[12:07] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[12:10] that it was good
[12:12] now in verse 11 and verse 12 when it
[12:14] says kind it's species and each one had
[12:17] us there was a species that was uh that
[12:20] God had carved out that God had created
[12:21] that God had set apart and he says Let
[12:23] each a herb and each grass in each tree
[12:26] bring forth after his kind whose seed is
[12:29] in itself and that seed could have been
[12:31] translated to semen it's it's that
[12:33] something has virility and Powers it has
[12:35] the ability to reproduce and bring forth
[12:37] it speaks of because it's seed it speaks
[12:39] of Offspring and descendants that come
[12:41] from everything that was in that seed
[12:44] and and there's uh there's I can't
[12:47] remember uh and I I'd heard it's I've
[12:50] seen it written it's kind of quite
[12:51] common phrase that you know we can we
[12:54] can take an apple and count these seeds
[12:56] that are in an apple but God actually
[12:57] knows just how many apples and apple
[12:59] trees can come from a seed because it's
[13:02] in there it's in it's in it's in the
[13:04] power of the seed to bring it forth and
[13:07] so the this is the species after his
[13:09] kind by the seed that is in it so God
[13:12] has ordained reproduction for certain
[13:15] species reproduction by seed
[13:17] and and Brother Band calls this in
[13:19] Genesis 1 11 God's law of reproduction
[13:23] so we can say whatever life was in the
[13:25] seed comes forth into the plant and then
[13:27] it goes into the fruit why because it's
[13:29] the law of God the law of reproduction
[13:31] God's law of reproduction you take seed
[13:34] germinates whatever process it goes
[13:36] through it says that life that's in the
[13:38] seed comes into a plant and then it
[13:40] comes into the fruit that's how God
[13:42] originally designed this and it's saying
[13:44] in chapter one this is what happened the
[13:46] seed in the Earth come forth into grass
[13:48] and trees yielding the herbs and the
[13:50] trees yielding fruit all of this came
[13:52] forth
[13:53] now in Genesis chapter 1 verse 28
[13:56] . it's got and now speaking to the man
[13:58] and the woman
[14:00] it says and God blessed them
[14:03] and God said unto them be fruitful and
[14:06] multiply and replenish the Earth my
[14:09] brother Brown helps us to connect that
[14:10] it's it's the same law of reproduction
[14:12] this species now this human race Adam as
[14:15] it were it's represented in Adam and the
[14:17] woman they are to also to be fruitful
[14:20] multiply and replenish the Earth and it
[14:22] says and subdue it and have dominion
[14:25] over the Fist of the sea and over the
[14:26] fowl of the air and over every living
[14:28] thing that moveth upon the Earth so we
[14:30] recognize that Adam is the first king on
[14:32] Earth as he's given dominion over every
[14:35] living thing so the his throne is
[14:37] established in Eden he has a domain over
[14:39] all living things here's Adam uh
[14:42] represented together with his wife
[14:44] standing there brother bam says in God's
[14:46] power to transform and God placed over
[14:48] this to rule all his great creation here
[14:51] on Earth his son and his son's bride
[14:53] Adam and Eve what do you have all the
[14:56] elements of the Kingdom you have a a
[14:59] king and his Queen you have the domain
[15:01] you're going to be given authority to
[15:02] rule and Reign Over everything and now
[15:04] they're under the Commandment to be
[15:06] fruitful multiply and replenish the
[15:09] Earth just as every seed was supposed to
[15:11] bring forth of its own kind now mankind
[15:14] is to bring forth of himself of his own
[15:16] kind
[15:18] right you with me just help me out a
[15:21] little bit tonight
[15:22] if you could you don't have to we don't
[15:26] have a noise meter up here we keep track
[15:28] we're not going to be sending out report
[15:29] cards on how well you pulled or he a
[15:31] manned but if you can help me help me
[15:33] and brother Nathaniel we we always tell
[15:36] the church don't say Amen if you can't
[15:38] because sometimes the preachers tell say
[15:40] Amen we find ourselves going no uh-huh
[15:43] can't do it but only say Amen if you can
[15:46] so now brother Brad makes two statements
[15:48] I'm just going to read these I don't
[15:49] have a slide for he says Adam was the
[15:51] son of God Eve was the daughter of God
[15:53] so I'm just I'm bringing this to you if
[15:55] it's the law of reproduction is that
[15:58] whatever life is in the seed comes into
[15:59] the plant and comes into the fruit then
[16:01] let's think of the same thing when it
[16:03] came to the man and the woman Adam is
[16:05] the Son of God Eve is the daughter of
[16:07] God and brother bear says another place
[16:08] Adam was a direct descendant descent
[16:11] from God
[16:12] and you only take the nature of your
[16:14] parent
[16:15] so if Adam was a direct descendant from
[16:18] God he's wanting us to recognize that
[16:20] there would have been the nature of God
[16:22] in Adam that that's there's nothing else
[16:24] mixing with it there's nothing else to
[16:27] defile it there's nothing else to
[16:28] influence except the spoken word has
[16:30] brought forth the supernatural being God
[16:32] is going to form uh by the word of God
[16:34] he's going to form and form a body from
[16:36] the dust of the earth and we saw him as
[16:37] a tree rooted in the earth and it has
[16:39] this great picture and uh that God is
[16:41] trying to portray to us and he said he
[16:43] has the nature of his parent so that
[16:46] when God tells the man and the woman to
[16:48] be fruitful and multiply and replace the
[16:50] Earth he's saying I want you to be
[16:51] parents and therefore the very nature
[16:54] that you have is to be sewn into and
[16:56] it's got to be the same nature the same
[16:58] life that'll come forth into the
[17:00] children
[17:01] now brother Bradham says this and I'm
[17:03] drawing really heavily from spoken words
[17:04] The Original Seed and and you're just
[17:07] gonna tonight just because just kind of
[17:09] stay with me we're just kind of walking
[17:11] through this and maybe I'm not making
[17:12] any big points at the beginning and
[17:14] maybe I won't make any big points at the
[17:15] end but hopefully he'll look back and
[17:16] say okay we got somewhere and it'll help
[17:19] us for the next time and the sermon
[17:21] spoken words The Original Seed he says
[17:22] notice what happened to Eve's children
[17:24] the first one that was born now I think
[17:27] that brings us to Genesis 4 we think
[17:28] about King now if God said multiply to
[17:31] his bride to Adam's bride and replenish
[17:33] multiply and replenish the Earth that
[17:35] was God's Commission
[17:38] and she would have done it and he would
[17:41] mixing themselves together
[17:44] now I think that's that's a that's maybe
[17:46] a mouthful just saying that but he's
[17:49] saying that and he's using maybe a
[17:51] phrase just for us to instead of trying
[17:52] to figure out just exactly what that
[17:54] would look like or just how it happened
[17:55] because there's some debates on whether
[17:57] or not it would be just only by Spoken
[17:58] Word or what would take place but he's
[18:00] saying it would have had to have been
[18:01] the two of them
[18:02] right as a couple you're 19
[18:06] and together bringing forth children
[18:09] that's how God originally intended it
[18:12] and so he says they would have done it
[18:14] and he uses the term mixing and I I
[18:16] don't want to focus that so much on the
[18:17] mixing but themselves in other words the
[18:20] only way that they could have fulfilled
[18:21] God's original commandment is it would
[18:23] have been for the man and the woman by
[18:25] whatever means that God would choose for
[18:27] them to mix
[18:29] that's how they were to bring forth
[18:30] children of God that's how they bring
[18:32] forth another atom or or another woman
[18:34] he would have done it she would have
[18:36] done it by mixing themselves together
[18:40] now turn in your Bibles to Mark chapter
[18:42] 10.
[18:43] because this is uh this is where
[18:47] we're maybe able to piggyback on some of
[18:49] the things we've already ministered on
[18:51] last month it says in Mark chapter 10
[18:53] verses 6 to 9 he's being asked a
[18:57] question about divorce and remarriage
[18:59] and in the resurrection you know who's
[19:01] going to be with who and he says and
[19:03] kind of the question is well why did
[19:06] Moses give us a writ of divorcement
[19:08] Jesus says here but from the beginning
[19:10] of the creation of God
[19:13] from the beginning of the creation God
[19:15] made them male and female
[19:19] now we recognize that as gender
[19:22] and it it it this gender has roots and
[19:24] species it says from the beginning of
[19:26] the creation God made them as he had
[19:28] spoke to them and said be fruitful
[19:29] multiply and replenish the Earth he made
[19:31] them male and female for this cause this
[19:34] is Genesis 3. this is or Genesis 2 this
[19:36] is the the utterance the prophetic
[19:38] utterance for this car shall a man leave
[19:40] his father and mother and cleave to his
[19:42] wife and they too shall be one flesh so
[19:46] then they are no more Twain but one
[19:48] flesh this beautiful Mysteries here
[19:50] beautiful deep truth he says what
[19:52] therefore God hath joined together let
[19:56] no man put asunder
[19:58] now I don't believe it's subtle but
[20:01] maybe it's not as apparent but but Jesus
[20:03] is talking about and the scriptures are
[20:05] talking about reproduction go back to
[20:07] Genesis 2 and you look at it now it's
[20:09] talking about reproduction because it
[20:10] says God made them male and female
[20:13] and by upsetting that fourth male and
[20:15] female relate to gender but not in the
[20:18] way that we're trying to confuse it
[20:19] today but it's in the sense that you
[20:21] have a certain species you have a
[20:23] certain kind and within that you have
[20:26] male and female
[20:27] and even the word gender comes from the
[20:29] root Gene which means to give birth or
[20:31] to beget so Jesus from the beginning of
[20:33] creation God made them male and female
[20:36] then this is for the purpose of
[20:38] begetting for bringing forth life
[20:41] and so just even to use the term of male
[20:43] and female to give gender construct it's
[20:47] it's done in terms in the role of
[20:49] reproduction solely like whatever what
[20:51] role does a person play in reproduction
[20:53] determines whether the male or a female
[20:55] and that's the truth that's the
[20:57] scientific truth that's the reality no
[20:58] matter how someone would try to change
[21:00] it
[21:00] and so he says that that wherefore
[21:04] and I know there's maybe a lot more to
[21:06] be we're leaving there to be spoken on
[21:08] but I want you just to catch this male
[21:11] and female and he's relating to the role
[21:13] of begetting bringing forth it says
[21:16] whatsoever God hath joined together
[21:19] let no man put asunder
[21:22] when it says join that means to be
[21:24] fastened to or yoked to
[21:27] and it the root is wagos which means
[21:30] pair or joined together
[21:33] and it comes from the root word zygote
[21:36] which means joined or yoked now this is
[21:39] to me this is really uh I wouldn't say
[21:42] just fascinating but this is the truth
[21:44] of what Jesus is saying as we go back
[21:46] and say well what what does it mean what
[21:48] God has joined together we only think in
[21:50] terms of I now in the name of the Lord
[21:52] Jesus Christ I pronounce you man and
[21:53] wife and then we say whatsoever God has
[21:55] joined together let no man put asunder
[21:56] and we kind of think by the power
[21:58] invested in me by the state of Arizona
[22:00] and as a minister of the Gospel I now
[22:02] join you together and we all go hey
[22:04] right and that's that's kind of how we
[22:07] think about it but this is a phrase that
[22:09] has such deep meaning and implication
[22:12] even the purpose of marriage and the
[22:14] marital Union and how God ordained it in
[22:16] the Garden of Eden what was the union
[22:18] for it's for bring forth
[22:20] it is is the for the purpose of bringing
[22:23] forth children and so he says that when
[22:25] he says let God whatever God had joined
[22:27] together the word is actually zygote you
[22:30] know what a zygote is it's the initial
[22:32] cell formed when a new organism is
[22:34] produced by the means of sexual
[22:35] reproduction
[22:36] whatsoever God hath ordained whatever
[22:39] God has joined together God has a way to
[22:42] where the man and the woman in the
[22:43] beginning were to produce an offspring
[22:45] and that would be the zygote that would
[22:47] be the joining together it's not which
[22:49] is produced by the the union of a male
[22:51] sperm and a female ovum
[22:53] and in that joining together it
[22:55] contained the DNA that's derived from
[22:58] both in order to form a new individual
[23:02] that's good stuff
[23:03] this is what's this is what's
[23:05] represented in the picture when he says
[23:06] whatsoever God had joined together let
[23:09] no man put asunder in other words this
[23:11] is how God ordained the man and the
[23:13] woman Adam would have I mean you could
[23:14] even say Adam was just one's being and
[23:18] in him was all the genetical makeup of
[23:20] Adam and then when God brings the woman
[23:22] out he's cleaved or separated out this
[23:26] DNA the agenda from Adam masculine
[23:29] feminine and so all the DNA in the woman
[23:31] would have originally been the DNA in
[23:33] the man
[23:33] but God has to portray this beautiful
[23:35] picture of what he's wanting to achieve
[23:37] and he couldn't achieved it with just an
[23:39] Adam because he's wanting to produce an
[23:42] earth to bring forth a bride he wants to
[23:44] be married to a bride in order for him
[23:46] to have abriety it has to become a
[23:47] bridegroom
[23:48] so this is what's in this picture that
[23:51] now the man when the woman comes out
[23:53] from the man she's his DNA
[23:55] hey she is him she's just equal but
[23:58] opposite in a different reflection he
[24:00] says that male and female God has
[24:03] determined that they would bring forth
[24:05] the material to produce another Son of
[24:07] God
[24:09] what God had joined the zygote that's
[24:11] the that there is going to be a
[24:13] formation of another uh seed from the
[24:17] man and the woman
[24:19] now I hope you can understand that
[24:22] is we we try to be delicate with maybe
[24:24] the way we express these things
[24:26] but I think that's just
[24:28] uh plain enough that God was intending
[24:32] this joining together this says
[24:34] comes back to the Commandment of Genesis
[24:36] 1 28 by mixing themselves together they
[24:39] would have brought forth children
[24:41] now if you look at Leviticus 19 I'll
[24:44] read just in two places in the Old
[24:45] Testament
[24:46] um on this and it's a vast subject but
[24:49] the Old Testament law forbade the
[24:51] practice of cross-breeding
[24:53] and you say well why there's just
[24:56] instead of spending a bunch of time
[24:58] showing it this is just the truth of it
[25:00] it weakens the Original Seed that by
[25:03] mixing this seed is good seed in this
[25:05] seed by mixing it together in doing so
[25:07] it doesn't it can't produce any one of
[25:10] the original seeds in its original form
[25:11] nor can it breed itself back
[25:13] and so it weakens it sows into weakness
[25:16] and it brings forth weakness in
[25:18] Leviticus 19 19. this shows God's
[25:21] attitude towards the mixing you shall
[25:23] keep my statutes Thou shalt not let thy
[25:26] cattle gender with a diverse kind that
[25:28] word gender that means breed or
[25:30] reproduce with a diverse kind it's uh
[25:33] and then it'll say mingled seed this is
[25:35] the forbidden hybrid mixture that God is
[25:38] telling the children of Israel to not do
[25:40] themselves so don't let the cattle
[25:42] gender with a diverse kind do Thou shalt
[25:45] not Sow by filled with mingle seed and
[25:47] then just so as to make the point
[25:49] neither shall a garment mingled of linen
[25:51] and Woolen come upon thee
[25:53] so this is maybe I'll express it this
[25:57] way this is God's attitude towards that
[25:59] practice
[26:01] and it's not that some of this carries
[26:03] on as God as an abomination in the eyes
[26:06] of God but he's doing something very
[26:08] distinct to show us that God had
[26:10] something in the original that if it
[26:12] stayed in the original it would have
[26:13] brought forth something and he's
[26:15] cautioning them and warning them that if
[26:17] you do it this is what causes as it uses
[26:20] the phrase that mingled and that's what
[26:22] mongolize comes from this mingling or
[26:24] mixing uh you don't sow different seeds
[26:27] in your field don't don't gender your
[26:29] cattle with different kinds this is
[26:30] God's law now if I could say it this way
[26:33] don't make good Evil by mixing it
[26:39] don't make something that's good Evil by
[26:42] mixing it because even in the root of
[26:45] the word evil it means to be broken
[26:47] asunder
[26:48] therefore whatever God hath joined
[26:50] together let no man make it evil
[26:54] let no man put asunder don't let it be
[26:57] divided don't let it be broken up
[26:58] however God originally intended it to be
[27:00] don't make it Evil by mixing it and
[27:03] brother Branham
[27:04] and and I just forgot which sermon it
[27:07] was in but he said that the tree of
[27:09] knowledge of Good and Evil it was a
[27:11] mixed tree
[27:13] notice how it's mixed it's it's a
[27:15] mixture of Good and Evil God doesn't
[27:17] want good to become evil by mixing it
[27:19] but good two things that are good can
[27:21] become evil by mixing them incorrectly
[27:25] and really you could just take brother
[27:27] by Adam's teaching and say you all you
[27:29] have to do is do it out of season
[27:31] right that's all it takes is to make
[27:33] something that's good evil is to use it
[27:35] out of season and so he says as we bring
[27:38] that back to the tree of knowledge of
[27:40] good and evil evil means to break
[27:41] asunder
[27:42] it's something that's broken or divided
[27:45] and this is how you can make something
[27:47] that seemingly good evil is by mixing it
[27:51] and so
[27:53] when I said that this practice of
[27:54] cross-breeding is is forbidden
[27:57] and their ward of it in the Old
[27:59] Testament I say let's not gender your
[28:01] cattle with diverse kind uh don't mingle
[28:03] your seed it's because if the all if in
[28:06] the way that God originally intended it
[28:08] that you have a species
[28:09] if you change the ovum or the sperm in
[28:12] other words if you don't take the same
[28:14] whatever God had joined together this is
[28:16] they're they're to produce this zygote
[28:17] it's going to be this DNA together is
[28:19] going to produce this if you change it
[28:22] it hybrid it's a hybrid
[28:24] and which which and if I can say this
[28:27] way cannot perfectly reproduce
[28:30] because if something if if you have two
[28:33] of the same thing then you're going to
[28:34] get the same thing right you say this is
[28:37] this is by by progeny by distribution
[28:40] has got to say it's going to bring forth
[28:42] after its kind whatever life was in the
[28:43] plant the seed comes forth in the plant
[28:45] comes forth the seed and it has the
[28:47] ability then and The Power Within it to
[28:49] bring forth another one but if you take
[28:52] it and you divide it asunder
[28:54] and now you're going to take
[28:56] um egg and and and and ovum and you're
[28:59] going to take sperm and you're going to
[29:00] now try to breed something and whatever
[29:01] you produce they're from two different
[29:02] species or two different kinds it
[29:04] produces something that's half and being
[29:06] mixed how can it bring forth something
[29:09] that's perfectly halved
[29:11] how is it going to be able to reproduce
[29:13] itself it cannot reproduce itself
[29:15] perfectly
[29:16] and brother I I think I have I keep
[29:19] wanting to quote brother Branham I'm not
[29:21] even sure if you even used this
[29:22] scripture but Deuteronomy 22 9 it says
[29:24] Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with
[29:26] diverse seeds now again this is a
[29:29] prescription very similar to the one we
[29:30] just read in Leviticus don't sell thy
[29:32] vineyard with diverse seeds now this is
[29:35] before you would have scientifically
[29:36] done it
[29:37] or even intentionally done it for the
[29:39] purpose of bringing for something
[29:40] different but he's saying don't do it
[29:42] lest the fruit of thy seed which thy has
[29:44] sown and the fruit of thy Vineyard be
[29:46] defiled God knew the power of the seed
[29:49] and and no doubt by then there had
[29:51] already been different plantings and
[29:53] different ways of trying to bring forth
[29:55] hybrid mixture we even see it in the
[29:56] nature of of the children to cause forth
[30:00] speckled cattle to come forth in certain
[30:02] ways that you try to influence progeny
[30:03] and the way things would be brought
[30:04] forth says don't sow your vinegar with
[30:06] diverse seeds because then the fruit
[30:08] that you the seeds you've sown and the
[30:11] subsequent fruit is going to be defiled
[30:13] so again it says diverse seeds it means
[30:15] two different kinds or mixture this is
[30:17] the mixing of seeds that's forbidden by
[30:19] the law if you mix two different kinds
[30:21] of seeds then your product will be
[30:23] defiled or desecrated or Unholy it's
[30:26] going to be a mixed seed
[30:28] and so you get something hybrid as we're
[30:30] looking at this hybriding tonight I
[30:32] guess that would be maybe the thrust of
[30:33] how we're looking at worldly kingdoms
[30:35] worldly kingdoms that exist today are a
[30:37] hybrid of what God originally produced
[30:39] a hybrid is a thing made by combining
[30:41] two different elements
[30:43] hybrid with The Offspring of two
[30:46] dissimilar appearance or dissimilar
[30:49] stock
[30:50] it means it's The Offspring of two
[30:53] plants or two animals of a different
[30:55] species and that's where we'd say such
[30:56] as a mule that you're not taking the
[30:59] same species and you're though they'd be
[31:01] of the same kind of genus to be able to
[31:03] mix they bring forth something that's
[31:05] not quite the same it's something that
[31:07] is a hybrid
[31:09] Aaron I find this very interesting that
[31:11] the word hybrid comes from the Latin
[31:12] hybrida which means The Offspring of a
[31:14] tame sound a wild boar
[31:17] and this is where we get the very term
[31:18] hybrid is something that is tame and
[31:20] something that is wild and that's why
[31:22] I'm trying to I'm just doing this very
[31:25] slowly to show you that the tares that
[31:26] were introduced in the beginning are
[31:28] something that is mixed in something
[31:30] that's impure and it brought forth
[31:32] something that's not entirely man but
[31:35] not entirely serpent
[31:38] it's that wheat's evil twin
[31:41] those tears as we read before Sundays
[31:43] they're not exactly wild but they're not
[31:45] exactly tame
[31:47] and so the original sin
[31:49] broke God's law of reproduction
[31:53] it broke God's original order because
[31:56] the woman gendered a diverse kind
[31:59] of it's a great Wednesday nights maybe a
[32:01] great time to speak this plainly on the
[32:03] original sin because it's really a hard
[32:05] one for a lot of people to swallow
[32:07] and I find that maybe we just we believe
[32:10] it's so uh adamantly and we see it so
[32:13] clearly that maybe there's not a lot of
[32:15] teaching that spit on it because we just
[32:16] believe it but it's good for us to
[32:18] understand this because when you read in
[32:20] the church age book and you read in the
[32:22] Bible you'll find that a lot of the
[32:23] things that are being taught a lot of
[32:25] things are being said we understand more
[32:27] perfectly when we can recognize what's
[32:28] happened in the beginning but remember
[32:30] go back to the beginning you'll get your
[32:31] picture straight and that's what we're
[32:33] wanting to do brother Bradham says in
[32:35] the church age book is we're looking at
[32:37] how what the woman she gendered a
[32:38] diverse kind he said the first son Adam
[32:40] was the spoken seed word of God he was
[32:43] the son of God he was a daughter of God
[32:45] he was a direct descent he had the
[32:46] nature of his parent he would have
[32:47] passed that on he was given a bride to
[32:51] reproduce himself
[32:54] that's what she's for
[32:56] that's what she's to do God made the
[32:59] woman in such a way to where what at
[33:01] whatever Adam put into her she would
[33:03] bring forth
[33:04] that's what that's what she had the she
[33:07] had the power of and I think it's a very
[33:09] good reminder for us to know as husbands
[33:11] whatever we're gonna whatever we're
[33:13] gonna give out we're gonna probably
[33:14] gonna get it back
[33:16] just a good reminder
[33:18] he was given a bride to reproduce
[33:20] himself that is why the bride was given
[33:22] him to reproduce himself to produce
[33:24] another Son of God but she fell so
[33:27] notice just how clear her role was and
[33:30] how they'd be joined together and it'd
[33:32] produce that that cell would begin to
[33:34] form to bring forth another child just
[33:36] like him but she fell and he uses this
[33:37] phrase she fell by hybridization
[33:40] she caused him to die
[33:43] through the hybriding
[33:45] but Brahman referring to it in the
[33:46] church age but say oh it was a fruit as
[33:48] the fruit he says no it was the
[33:49] degradation of humanity by intermingling
[33:51] the seed this is how brother bam taught
[33:54] us the original sin it degraded Humanity
[33:56] by intermingling the seed of the human
[33:59] Adam and the woman with that seed of the
[34:01] serpent
[34:03] he spoke a word to the Original Seed he
[34:04] said she crossed her seed she mingled it
[34:06] with the serpent Siege she brought a
[34:09] child of death think of that she brought
[34:11] a child to death a child that she
[34:13] perverted every child after that
[34:17] through that Crossing her seed
[34:20] I hope I hope that it's just plain to
[34:22] you and I know that these are things I'm
[34:24] not breaking new ground uh today in any
[34:26] way but I'm wanting you just to see
[34:28] plainly the emphasis that Brothers
[34:30] brother M is putting on this
[34:32] she crossed her seeds she fell by hybrid
[34:34] and it brought this is a maybe the real
[34:37] uh part maybe I uh I want you to catch
[34:40] this part death came by that
[34:44] clearly that's how death came
[34:47] now Genesis chapter 3
[34:49] we'll start with verse 14. we maybe have
[34:51] to 16 but maybe we might stop a little
[34:53] early
[34:54] we've gone over this scripture so often
[34:56] I think we can just read it now after
[34:58] the indeed has been done and the seed
[34:59] has been sown the Lord God said unto the
[35:01] serpent because thou has done this Thou
[35:04] Art cursed above all cattle
[35:06] and above every beast of the field upon
[35:09] thy belly shalt not go and thus shalt
[35:10] thou eat all the days of thy life
[35:14] and I will put enmity between thee and
[35:17] the woman
[35:18] and between thy seed and her seed
[35:22] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[35:25] bruise his Hill
[35:27] and then verse 16 is going greater into
[35:29] how the woman in sorrow will bring forth
[35:32] children
[35:33] and and the desire to her husband he
[35:34] shall rule over thee but notice how when
[35:37] he's cursing the serpent
[35:39] the curse of the serpent raises the
[35:42] image of the seed of the woman and the
[35:44] seed of The Serpent and being message
[35:47] Believers we know why it says because
[35:49] thou Hast done this the whole world
[35:51] reads it says because you lied to the
[35:53] woman this is what's going to happen no
[35:54] it was more than just a lie the LIE is
[35:57] what brought forth the ACT this is
[35:58] because thou has done this you are going
[36:00] to be cursed and as he curses them and
[36:03] in the image of him being cursed and
[36:04] coming into the ground to eat the dust
[36:06] of the earth he says I'll put enmity
[36:08] between thee and the woman and then this
[36:10] greater emphasis between via seed and
[36:12] her seed so in the curse he's wanting
[36:15] this picture of the seat of The Serpent
[36:17] and the seed of the woman to be
[36:19] represented
[36:20] and then the transformation of the
[36:22] serpent
[36:23] foreshadows the process that would set
[36:26] into Humanity
[36:28] as the serpent beguiled Eve and caused
[36:31] her to fall there's a mixing that takes
[36:34] place and this mixing would change the
[36:36] entire human species
[36:38] and brother Branham I'll say it changed
[36:42] man Adam and what his race was to be it
[36:44] was going to be a particular way had a
[36:46] particular Gene set it was going to be
[36:47] in the nature of God after the parent of
[36:49] Adam this is the way it was going to be
[36:50] brother Branham is you drawing from what
[36:52] happened to the Garden he says the same
[36:54] thing happens to denominations and he
[36:56] says the whole specie has changed
[37:02] I feel like I may be reading from the
[37:03] wrong Church age book or something with
[37:05] so few amens tonight
[37:08] you've read these things haven't you
[37:11] dust it up don't be afraid of the church
[37:12] age book dust It Off I mean many people
[37:14] tell you Shakespeare wrote the King
[37:16] James version Bible and we're not afraid
[37:18] of that
[37:19] trust the Lord there's things we can
[37:20] learn from these things
[37:22] he says and so now listen to how brother
[37:24] Bradham said it he says you know what a
[37:26] hybrid is what comes of two species
[37:28] mixing
[37:30] the result is no longer pure like the
[37:33] original it is mongrel
[37:36] so when you mix something the result is
[37:38] no longer pure like the original so it
[37:41] doesn't that's again this is my emphasis
[37:43] it doesn't mean that you have to take
[37:45] something evil and mix it with something
[37:46] good he's just saying if you've take
[37:49] taken two species good species good
[37:52] species but different species right and
[37:55] you mix them that product is no longer
[37:58] pure like the original
[38:01] that's what a hybrid is he says well Eve
[38:03] allowed the Beast to mingle his seed
[38:05] with hers she produced a creature
[38:07] cocaine that wasn't pure human
[38:11] now that's striking
[38:13] because then this is where we recognize
[38:15] that this is what brother Brown says she
[38:16] perverted every child after that because
[38:19] in the process of time it's foreshadowed
[38:21] and now the serpent is going to come
[38:23] down to the Earth and he's going to fall
[38:26] take over the whole earth and he's going
[38:28] to have
[38:30] or he's going to come down to the Earth
[38:32] he's going to rock upon the Earth he's
[38:33] going to Slither upon the Earth then in
[38:35] that transforming of the serpent of an
[38:38] upright Beast to the Eater of the Dust
[38:41] God is showing us this is what's been
[38:43] sewn into Adam
[38:46] the king of Eden
[38:48] this this race that was above all race
[38:50] the one that was given dominion over all
[38:51] the Earth it's now going to succumb to
[38:53] the Earth
[38:55] that's going to be hybrid and drawn down
[38:57] there she produced a creature called
[38:58] Cain that wasn't pure human he was of
[39:00] the wicked one
[39:02] notice how different he was from Abel
[39:03] notice how different he was from Seth he
[39:06] hated God and would not obey the word
[39:07] and persecuted and killed the righteous
[39:11] he says he set himself up above the word
[39:14] of God
[39:15] Network program said shows the serpent
[39:17] seed they can't humble themselves to the
[39:18] word of God they just can't do it
[39:21] and so he says he hated God and would
[39:23] not obey the word and persecuted and
[39:25] killed the righteous that's the mark of
[39:27] it even to this day
[39:29] for the very moment
[39:31] that God said the woman seed will crush
[39:34] the head of the seed of the serpent
[39:36] the seed of the serpent is represented
[39:38] by this entity that is no longer pure
[39:41] human right
[39:42] that is how the serpent lives on
[39:45] inhumanity not in the snakes upon the
[39:47] Earth but in Cain
[39:49] so that's the seat of the serpent this
[39:51] mixing this mixed creature and so he
[39:53] says the seed of the serpent that that
[39:55] nature that mixed nature is going to be
[39:56] crushed by the seed of the woman Satan
[40:00] knew that the curse was going to be
[40:02] lifted off of man Satan knew that
[40:05] whatever was sown into Humanity whatever
[40:07] he sowed into the human race there was
[40:09] going to be the seed of the woman
[40:11] because the seed of the woman is going
[40:12] to bring it back to the original
[40:14] he said this is going to be I I've
[40:16] managed to produce a hybrid but now he's
[40:19] saying the seed of the woman which this
[40:20] the devil knew that would have to be a
[40:23] pure child between Adam and the the
[40:25] woman
[40:25] Satan knew that so what happens
[40:28] immediately he knew
[40:31] that the pure seed of the woman would
[40:33] Prevail so what happens as soon as Abel
[40:36] manifests and came manifest Cain murders
[40:39] Abel because Satan knows that's the seed
[40:41] of the woman and he's afraid that that's
[40:43] going to be the one that'll kill Cain
[40:47] because if Cain had been dealt within
[40:49] think about it
[40:51] I mean if pain just would have kind of
[40:52] everybody says if we could just go back
[40:54] in a time machine and kill Hitler right
[40:55] oh we'd like and we just would solve the
[40:58] Holocaust and we wouldn't have a World
[41:00] War II it's like well you know I don't
[41:02] know how much luck he might have with
[41:03] them I think why did they just kill Cain
[41:05] in the beginning well how many
[41:07] hypothecate on that all the time but it
[41:09] was the nature of the seed within Cain
[41:13] to rise up against the righteous Abel
[41:15] and he and he kills them
[41:17] but this is and I just say that because
[41:20] that's where he says he hated and would
[41:21] not obey the word and persecute and
[41:23] killed the righteous it's because Satan
[41:24] knew the plan of God and was always
[41:26] waiting for the seed of the woman to
[41:27] come forth
[41:29] as we read on on Sunday Isaiah 14 12.
[41:32] how about fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer
[41:35] son of the morning how about cut down to
[41:37] the ground there's your image of Satan
[41:39] being cast out of heaven now embodying
[41:42] the serpent and that serpent that he
[41:44] used is cut down to the ground
[41:45] the Bible says you're going to crawl on
[41:46] my belly you're going to be you're going
[41:48] to be cursed above all cattle every
[41:50] beast of the field upon my belly thou
[41:51] shall go thou shall I eat dust all the
[41:53] days of your life it's represented here
[41:54] in Lucifer cut down to the ground and
[41:56] then what did the serpent do he
[41:58] intermingled seed and a caused mankind
[42:01] to die and the Bible says which does
[42:02] weaken the Nations
[42:04] there's your Humanity being brought low
[42:06] there's it's being brought down to the
[42:08] Earth it's it's losing its connection
[42:10] man was to be intended to be upright or
[42:13] has intended to be that that fastening
[42:15] Between Heaven and Earth but now through
[42:17] the fall that's cut off he loses the
[42:19] holy image of God he doesn't have that
[42:21] connection to heaven anymore he's now
[42:23] entirely EarthBound
[42:25] he's been brought down to the Earth
[42:28] it's weakened and mingled the Nations
[42:30] which nations there's Humanity
[42:32] and now
[42:34] with that with those things said this is
[42:37] going to be kind of a little bit of a
[42:38] pivot here in the sermon future home of
[42:40] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[42:41] bride but the man says then what
[42:43] happened he set Adam and Eve here on the
[42:46] earth and said multiply now and
[42:48] replenish the earth now remember this
[42:51] from a couple Sundays ago their bodies
[42:54] were all laid out here for you to eat
[42:56] and make your body
[42:58] it's already laid out all the materials
[43:00] already laid out already in the earth
[43:02] already by the spoken word he says their
[43:04] bodies were already laid out here it was
[43:06] in the earth he says for you to eat make
[43:08] your body that's the that's the way he
[43:11] had of doing it
[43:13] so that means God's original program
[43:15] Genesis 1 and 2 it's a framed person
[43:17] perfect picture all the spoken word is
[43:19] already in there
[43:20] and if it it would have brought forth
[43:23] just exactly the way that God had
[43:24] intended it to he said that's the way
[43:26] God's doing it all the materials laying
[43:28] out there like a contractor putting out
[43:29] all this material it's already there he
[43:31] says their bodies already laid out here
[43:33] for you to eat and make your body it was
[43:34] already in there
[43:35] and is it not the very things that we
[43:37] feed on today that have come from the
[43:38] earth that are giving us the energy and
[43:40] the minerals and the nutrients in order
[43:42] to form this body to to be healthy and
[43:44] to cause it to grow it's that energy
[43:46] being furnished to the DNA that's
[43:47] already inside of you expressing what's
[43:49] in the blueprint
[43:51] he says but sin came along and
[43:52] interrupted his plan
[43:55] and we know that that means that Satan
[43:58] worked out which was necessary to
[44:00] fulfill the master plan right so it
[44:03] interrupts his plan but it was all part
[44:05] of his plan
[44:06] did you get that
[44:07] his plan's been interrupted but it was
[44:09] his plan to have the plan interrupted
[44:12] so now he says of the Earth
[44:15] she rolls right on time and the Earth
[44:17] and everything she rolls right on just
[44:19] the same time does
[44:21] so once Satan interrupted it
[44:23] everything's there
[44:25] sorry it's in the earth he says now
[44:28] everything that's going to be has
[44:30] already been sown and now the man and
[44:32] the woman they they mix there's a mix in
[44:35] a seed Cain comes forth Abel then Seth
[44:37] he says time just rolls on everything
[44:39] just goes on
[44:40] he says in the same sermon you see how
[44:42] Satan got to Eve now
[44:44] and that's why death has reigned on
[44:46] Earth ever since
[44:50] wanting this to be such a clear picture
[44:52] to us when we look at the kingdoms of
[44:54] this world when we think of the things
[44:55] that exist in the world today when Satan
[44:57] got to Eve he said that's why death has
[45:00] reigned on Earth ever since
[45:02] and Heavens Earth Beast atmosphere is
[45:04] all cursed of God because of it
[45:07] filling up all of these things are
[45:10] cursed because of it that's the curse
[45:12] because Satan got to this first
[45:16] so are we able to come to a spot then to
[45:20] recognize what took place in Genesis 3
[45:23] what is taking place in Genesis 4 and in
[45:26] the successive chapters what's coming
[45:28] out until we get to Abraham you see all
[45:31] worldly kingdoms coming into into being
[45:35] and then from there everything else is
[45:37] just a reiteration of it going stronger
[45:39] and growing greater growing more evil
[45:45] but if I could say this I want to end on
[45:47] a positive note I want to go ahead and
[45:48] continue so I can end with a few more
[45:50] amens tonight hopefully
[45:53] God's original plan cannot be defeated
[45:55] however
[45:57] the seeds that he sowed will not return
[45:58] to him void
[46:00] the kingdom as we're just using that
[46:01] phrase we're not trying to create some
[46:03] nomenclature that we can only use it's
[46:05] just a way of describing something so we
[46:06] all think about the same thing the
[46:08] kingdom would be restored
[46:10] and it is prophesied as the seed of the
[46:13] woman
[46:14] so read with me in Hebrews chapter 2
[46:16] verses 9 to 8 18.
[46:20] I just want to read this because I feel
[46:22] that with this background with this
[46:24] Foundation we can read this
[46:26] it just has so much Rich uh meaning and
[46:31] depth and color to it
[46:33] so it says in Hebrews 2 verse 9 we'll
[46:35] read to verse 18 but we see Jesus
[46:38] who is made a little lower than the
[46:40] angels for the suffering of death this
[46:43] is why he was made lower than the angels
[46:47] for the suffering of death
[46:49] death has reigned ever since
[46:53] the eve fell and caused a hybrid product
[46:57] to come forth so one is by judgment
[47:00] other one is by seed by mixing it's just
[47:03] sewn into it could we I could make the
[47:05] point now you notice how long man would
[47:07] live early on that even the pure the
[47:09] pure seed from Adam lived longer and
[47:12] they died because God says you want the
[47:14] day you eat the day you die so by
[47:16] judgment not no one could live that
[47:18] Thousand Years
[47:19] but but for the rest
[47:21] they they're dying because the mixing of
[47:23] seed they're weakened they they just get
[47:25] younger or they get they live they die
[47:27] younger and die Younger die younger why
[47:29] because it was through the mixing
[47:30] through the hybriding
[47:32] and so Jesus
[47:35] is going to come made lower than the
[47:37] Angels try so he's made now he's man
[47:40] this may lower the age he's coming in
[47:43] the image of humanity
[47:44] as Adam would have been a spiritual
[47:46] supernatural being that would have
[47:47] inhabited flesh you're trying to say in
[47:49] this hierarchy he comes forth as a flesh
[47:51] being and we see him but we see Jesus
[47:53] crowned with Glory and Honor there's
[47:56] your king
[47:58] that he by the grace of God should taste
[48:01] death for every man
[48:04] for it became him for whom are all
[48:06] things
[48:07] by whom are all things in bringing many
[48:09] sons unto glory to the same Crown to the
[48:11] same Throne to make the captain of their
[48:13] salvation perfect through sufferings
[48:16] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[48:19] who are Sanctified are all of One
[48:24] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[48:26] call them brethren
[48:28] so the sanctifier has Sanctified those
[48:32] that are his he says they're all one
[48:34] he's not ashamed to call your brethren
[48:36] and then now Paul quotes from different
[48:37] scriptures according from the Psalms
[48:39] according from Isaiah saying I will
[48:40] declare thy name unto my brethren in the
[48:43] midst of the church it may be
[48:45] congregation in Psalms in the midst of
[48:46] the church will I sing praise unto thee
[48:48] I will declare it by name unto my
[48:50] brethren in the midst of the church to
[48:52] say this is the Affinity this is the
[48:54] connection
[48:55] and again I will put my trust in him and
[48:59] again behold I and the children which
[49:02] God hath given me
[49:04] this has to do with uh progeny and
[49:07] procreation and reproduction that he's
[49:09] going to be the firstborn among many
[49:11] Brethren he is going to have he has a
[49:14] nature that is divine and those who are
[49:16] the children of God will share the same
[49:18] nature and and be won together with them
[49:21] they will be the same life
[49:23] they have to be in order to be the for
[49:25] him to be the firstborn among any
[49:27] Brethren has to have the same exact
[49:29] nature doesn't say the first half
[49:30] Brothers
[49:32] they have to be the he has to be the
[49:34] firstborn among many brother not half
[49:36] brother and half sisters it have to be
[49:38] the same two pair the same parents
[49:40] for as much then as the children are
[49:44] partakers of flesh and blood which we
[49:46] are
[49:47] he also himself likewise took part of
[49:50] the same
[49:51] why did he take part of the same that
[49:54] through death
[49:55] he might destroy him that had the power
[49:58] of death that is the devil
[50:01] Satan from the beginning wanted to kill
[50:04] the seed of the woman and that was part
[50:07] of the plan that God had
[50:09] when Satan set forth his plan and the
[50:11] Bible even tells us that had the princes
[50:14] of this world known
[50:16] what was going to happen they wouldn't
[50:18] have crucified the Lord Of Glory had
[50:20] Satan known that by killing him would it
[50:23] actually be the great foil to his plan
[50:25] he would not have done it
[50:27] but Satan he says Satan had the power of
[50:30] death he's the one that part of the
[50:32] devil why because he's the one that
[50:34] brought the death through the mixing so
[50:37] Jesus comes having bypassed the mix
[50:41] having been the seed that was prophesied
[50:44] to come the Original Seed when he comes
[50:46] God then and just I guess it just passes
[50:49] our understanding it's so hard for us to
[50:51] even grasp what happens but he tastes
[50:54] death that through that death it
[50:56] destroyed the power of death
[50:59] he defeated death by death and death is
[51:01] going to die
[51:04] he says and deliver them who through
[51:07] fear of death were all their lifetimes
[51:09] subject to bondage
[51:11] he's loosening us from death
[51:14] severely he took on him the nature took
[51:17] not on him
[51:18] the nature of angels but he took on him
[51:20] the Seed of Abraham
[51:22] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[51:24] to be made likened to his brethren
[51:27] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[51:29] high priest in things pertaining to God
[51:31] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[51:34] the people now this is we sing it but
[51:37] recognize it in this instance he was
[51:39] made likened unto us
[51:42] not that he would remain like us and
[51:45] just merely die the death of us but we
[51:48] see him who suffered death being crowned
[51:51] with Glory and Honor so by his death he
[51:54] has forever consecrated a way that we
[51:57] would not remain in this human state but
[52:00] that we too could become like him
[52:03] that's why he says we're brother and he
[52:05] says he that sanctifies which would be
[52:07] Christ by the shedding of his blood and
[52:09] he that has Sanctified we who are
[52:11] Sanctified by the blood are children of
[52:15] God we are back to the original seat
[52:17] again we're back to the original life we
[52:20] are removed from the bondage of the fear
[52:22] of death so oh well what about those
[52:24] that die it doesn't matter that's just
[52:26] something that happens to this flesh
[52:27] that Still Remains hybrid but there's
[52:29] been a new nature birth on inside of you
[52:32] listen this is why you must be born
[52:35] again
[52:36] my I don't I don't God forgive me if I
[52:39] say this the wrong way I don't
[52:40] understand why we get so confused on the
[52:42] new birth and the baptism of the Holy
[52:44] Ghost in the point brother braham's
[52:46] trying to make but he says there's a
[52:47] difference why because there can be an
[52:49] anointing that can fall on flesh and
[52:51] that anointing may never change a person
[52:53] but the new birth makes you a new
[52:55] creature to be born again brings you out
[52:58] from under the hybrid nature and sets
[53:00] inside of you it's your soul
[53:03] a carousel that can never die
[53:12] deliver them oh praise the Lord
[53:16] be made like unto his brethren
[53:18] so he can be a faithful high priest
[53:20] knowing what we're going through
[53:22] was he not tempted in all that like in
[53:24] manner as we are
[53:25] yet knew no sin
[53:30] I say well does uh perfection
[53:33] does the Perfection relate to sinlessly
[53:35] snow
[53:36] because he was made perfect through
[53:38] suffering
[53:40] so it's not just a sinless Perfection
[53:42] that makes us perfect it's that process
[53:45] in the verse 18 I guess this I wanted to
[53:47] get read all the way to this friend that
[53:49] he himself hath suffered being tempted
[53:52] he's able to secure them that are
[53:54] tempted
[53:55] he's able to help you
[53:57] take this to Heart tonight I felt
[53:59] impressed to end on this scripture to to
[54:02] know that he who is perfect who's been
[54:05] crowned with Glory and Honor who has
[54:07] come after the original program of God
[54:10] the Son of God the spoken word Son of
[54:12] God who've come into flesh a taste of
[54:15] death for us who suffered being tempted
[54:18] and he's able to help them that are
[54:20] tempted
[54:21] this is the power of the king this is
[54:24] the power that Christ can give now that
[54:26] when we are tempted he is able to help
[54:28] us
[54:29] because wherein is that we are tempted
[54:31] it's going to be yet still in the realm
[54:33] of our flesh in the realm of our mind
[54:36] it's going to be through those senses of
[54:37] the mind and body that's the realm in
[54:39] which we are going to be tempted he says
[54:41] I am able to help you when you're
[54:43] tempted
[54:45] brother Branham says in the church age
[54:46] book chapter three we'll invite our
[54:48] brothers to come to their instruments
[54:49] then there was to come a day when God
[54:53] would appear in flesh
[54:55] and by the means of his humiliation
[54:57] he would restore Fallen men and make him
[55:01] a partaker of that life eternal
[55:04] he says once you see this you can
[55:06] understand the serpent seed and know
[55:08] that it was no apple Eve ate
[55:10] once you see this you can see that it
[55:14] was no apple
[55:15] this is why God he came apart from the
[55:18] instrumentality of man this is why God
[55:20] formed him in the womb of a virgin this
[55:23] is why God took these of his own without
[55:25] borrowing it from a hybrid man or Barnet
[55:28] from a hybrid woman he took original and
[55:31] he mixed it together and he brought
[55:33] forth the pure a pure Son of God
[55:37] bypassing that act bypassing the timing
[55:40] and and the the placement of the
[55:42] original sin and he said that day would
[55:45] come when God would appear in flesh this
[55:47] is what's being spoken of here in
[55:48] Hebrews 2 9 that Jesus made lower than
[55:52] the Angels this is God appearing in
[55:55] human flesh
[55:57] and he would restore Fallen man
[56:00] and make him a partaker of life eternal
[56:03] brother Branham says in chapter three
[56:04] the seat of the womb was literally God
[56:06] reproducing himself in human flesh
[56:09] he is not using literally figuratively
[56:11] he's using literally literally
[56:14] the seat of the woman was literally God
[56:16] reproducing himself in human flesh
[56:21] that's what's represented in Genesis 3.
[56:25] brother says but God came in the flesh
[56:28] follow me
[56:29] God came in the flesh
[56:32] give us another birth
[56:34] to bring us back to original Sons and
[56:36] Daughters of God
[56:38] that's why except you be born again you
[56:39] cannot see
[56:41] the kingdom of heaven
[56:43] but the man well I had someone testify
[56:44] to me recently just the impact your
[56:46] sermon made when you're talking about
[56:47] raising the message
[56:49] knew all about it but you must be born
[56:51] again
[56:53] you must be born again you're being
[56:55] taught Kingdom principles in your home
[56:56] you're being taught about the kingdom
[56:58] you're learning things about Christ
[56:59] you're learning things about the word of
[57:01] God but unless you're born again don't
[57:04] take this the wrong way and I'm not
[57:05] necessarily saying in a bad way but it's
[57:07] me it's not entirely a good thing until
[57:09] that happens you are only the product of
[57:12] your parents
[57:13] no matter how much you believe no matter
[57:16] how much you believe it's true you must
[57:18] be born again because cry God Came In
[57:21] the Flesh to give us another birth and
[57:24] it's by the new birth that we come back
[57:26] to original Sons and Daughters of God
[57:30] [Music]
[57:31] by that life that now lives within our
[57:33] souls
[57:35] now I want to read this statement this
[57:36] is the same the the statement the quote
[57:38] I read when we in the last sermon of
[57:40] this series he says we belong to a
[57:42] kingdom
[57:43] and the kingdom is the word of God made
[57:46] spirit and life in our own life bringing
[57:48] to pass every promise in this day as it
[57:51] did in that day when the word and God
[57:54] were one
[57:56] see that Oneness
[57:58] see that in order to be United together
[58:01] with them you are him
[58:03] you have to be him because that was the
[58:05] picture in the beginning that God had
[58:07] set that God had framed
[58:10] and what's remarkable in this before God
[58:12] could Brethren says this and this is the
[58:14] part I was pulling all these things out
[58:16] but the bigger picture and the bigger
[58:17] narrative that he's using in all these
[58:19] places is the picture in the at the day
[58:21] of Pentecost here's a church that comes
[58:23] forth just like the woman was given to
[58:25] Adam to reproduce another atom to
[58:28] reproduce another Son of God Christ was
[58:30] given a church on the day of Pentecost
[58:31] to reproduce himself he says before he
[58:34] could come to her she was hybrid
[58:36] and so through successive ages there's
[58:39] still this hybrid nature in there until
[58:42] the end he's able to bring it back to
[58:44] the original and that's why we can be
[58:46] raptured that's why there can be a
[58:47] harvest because that seed comes back to
[58:50] its Perfection again
[58:52] in the representation of the Bride
[58:54] it'll bring up all the individuals down
[58:56] throughout time who were born again
[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] to bring to pass every promise in this
[59:02] day as it did in that day when the word
[59:05] in God Was Won
[59:07] Hallelujah could we pray tonight
[59:09] together as you stand
[59:11] [Music]
