[0:00] as we mentioned last Sunday we're
[0:01] starting a a Christmas series on the
[0:03] subject of hate and we're going to
[0:05] continue on that today we've asked the
[0:07] question in the first service looking at
[0:08] how Christ is our peace and the peace
[0:10] that he brings and we asked the question
[0:12] where's the peace Wednesday night we
[0:14] spoke on where's the love and we were
[0:17] looking at love as kind of the opposite
[0:19] of hate um as we used peace even as an
[0:22] opposite of hate we could see those uh
[0:24] those contrary emotions and even uh
[0:27] situations and so I want to just jump
[0:29] right into it do a little bit of review
[0:31] here at the outset just for a few
[0:32] minutes just to capture some things and
[0:34] then we'll just get deeper into the
[0:35] subject we've been defining hate as an
[0:37] intense negative emotional response so
[0:40] it's intense it's negative and it's an
[0:42] emotion uh towards someone or something
[0:45] so it's some kind of response you have
[0:47] to someone it's something you might have
[0:49] towards something and at the heart of
[0:52] this hate because we use the term
[0:53] sometimes I hate it when I'm late or I
[0:54] hate it when this happens I hate it when
[0:56] that happens and we're just kind of
[0:57] using it as a a word it's not
[0:59] necessarily intense though it does
[1:02] Express something negative but what I'm
[1:04] looking at is not just the phrase that
[1:07] we use in terms of hate but the real the
[1:09] real hate that is malicious that's
[1:11] spiteful that we experience sometimes
[1:13] this emotion uh you regard something
[1:16] with extreme ill will or you have a
[1:18] passionate aversion to something those
[1:21] are uh the words that we're talking
[1:22] about in terms of hate and one of the
[1:24] ways that it's best uh kind of describes
[1:26] to me is described to me that I best
[1:29] understand what this hate is it means to
[1:31] treat as an enemy and so if you hate
[1:34] someone they become your enemy and and
[1:36] to the one that you hate you appear as
[1:38] an enemy because of your hatred uh and
[1:41] that one that's hated may be like well I
[1:43] don't have a problem with them but
[1:44] they're my enemy because they have hate
[1:47] and so to that treating as an enemy and
[1:49] even that phrasing of enemy is very
[1:51] large in the scripture when it deals
[1:53] with hate and so I want to be sure that
[1:55] that's kind of in our minds as we go
[1:57] forward that if you hate something you
[1:59] treat it as if it's your enemy as If it
[2:01] threatens you and it could destroy you
[2:03] or take away from you something that you
[2:05] love and we looked at on Wednesday
[2:08] especially that there is a hate that
[2:10] precedes love for God in other words
[2:12] there's a hate that comes after a love
[2:15] for God and this hate is a rooted in we
[2:18] could say agape love and it's a love for
[2:20] justice and righteousness and it's a
[2:22] love for the word and when you love the
[2:24] word and the more that you learn about
[2:26] the word the more you hate false ways
[2:28] and the more that you learn about the
[2:29] nature of God the more you detest evil
[2:32] and your love is going to be uh not
[2:33] going to be hypocritical you're going to
[2:35] uh cleave to that which is good you're
[2:37] going to love the word of God and then
[2:39] in doing so you're going to be horrified
[2:41] by evil or hate evil and so there is a
[2:45] hate in the scripture that uh we ought
[2:47] to have but it comes after our love for
[2:50] God and Amos 5: 14 and 15 it says seek
[2:55] good and not evil and and I I just
[2:59] realized I didn't give you you kind of
[3:00] my my title for today is where's the
[3:02] strength a and I'm thinking where's the
[3:05] power where's the Vitality where's the
[3:06] life where's the living where's the
[3:08] strength and so it says seek good and
[3:10] not evil that you may live and I I see
[3:12] this image of Vitality and life and
[3:14] strength there seek good and not evil
[3:17] that you may live and so the Lord the
[3:19] god of hosts shall be with you as you
[3:21] have spoken hate the evil and love the
[3:24] good so here's a explicit commandment to
[3:27] hate and I know some of you might just
[3:28] write down that Heart Alone hate the
[3:30] evil and then that's kind of subjective
[3:32] as far as you're concerned you can
[3:34] determine what is evil and therefore
[3:35] what you can hate but it's saying hate
[3:37] the evil and love the good and establish
[3:40] judgment in the gate it may be that the
[3:42] Lord God of host will be gracious unto
[3:44] the remnant of Joseph notice these
[3:46] Commandments uh to seek good and not
[3:48] evil and as you seek good you're to love
[3:51] the good and then as a companion to that
[3:54] it says hate the evil and if I could say
[3:56] this the proper hate of evil is not
[3:59] possible possible without the right kind
[4:00] of love for good you can say well I just
[4:03] hate evil things I just hate wickedness
[4:04] and you can be full of hate for things
[4:06] that appear bad or things that you
[4:07] believe are wicked and I would even say
[4:09] that you could hate things that are
[4:11] truly Wicked and Abominations in the
[4:13] eyes of God but that hate can never be
[4:15] correct unless you first have the right
[4:18] kind of love for God so this hate that
[4:21] we're told to have for evil is not
[4:23] possible without loving the good because
[4:25] it must be a hate that is motivated by
[4:27] love a hate that's coming from a good
[4:29] place a hate that's coming from a safe
[4:31] place a hate that's coming from a higher
[4:34] grer emotion that's not destructive but
[4:36] Redemptive because if we just have a a
[4:39] carnal hate then we would just eradicate
[4:40] we would destroy and we would we would
[4:42] we would Vanquish anything associated
[4:44] with it but that's not the love that we
[4:46] that's not the ruling emotion that we
[4:48] ought to have we can hate the evil as
[4:51] long as we love the good so there is a
[4:54] hate that comes after the love for God
[4:56] and the love for his word now looking at
[4:59] had a different kind of hate in
[5:01] Galatians 5: 20 and I believe we'll come
[5:04] back to uh some of the verses
[5:06] surrounding this later on and hopefully
[5:09] give some more uh context to it but it's
[5:12] describing the uh The Works of the Flesh
[5:16] and it's referring to adultery and
[5:17] fornication and uncleanness and
[5:19] lasciviousness and we might be thinking
[5:22] uh wow that's uh this those are pretty
[5:25] strong words but then it it gets into
[5:27] idolatry and and witchcraft and we might
[5:30] be feeling pretty good so far in all
[5:32] this especially some of the young people
[5:33] be think man I'm checking off all the
[5:35] boxes and then it says hatred and it's
[5:36] like
[5:37] oh and then variance and some of these
[5:40] words are all tied together once it gets
[5:41] to hatred hatred variance emulations
[5:44] wrath strife seditions heresies and it's
[5:47] describing all the works of the flesh
[5:49] which Paul says and no and I've told you
[5:51] before that people who do these things
[5:53] cannot inherit the kingdom of God and so
[5:55] this is a real forceful comments that
[5:57] he's making but this is uh this hatred
[6:00] that's referred to here is a hatred
[6:02] that's driven by an improper love if we
[6:05] just use it for convenience that there's
[6:06] an agape love but then there's also
[6:08] human loves and human emotions and
[6:10] affections in lust and so this is a
[6:12] hatred that's driven by lust uh it's
[6:15] driven by aggression and these are the
[6:17] things that are motivating your
[6:18] motivation isn't the same when you love
[6:20] something and then hate something as a
[6:22] consequence this is driven solely uh by
[6:25] an improper emotions and even as it says
[6:28] hatred and invariance that's debate
[6:30] contention Strife it gets into
[6:32] emulations and wrath and the anger that
[6:34] follows these things so these are all
[6:36] things kind of connected together and
[6:38] related to hatred but this hatred we'll
[6:42] call it hate or we could call it hatred
[6:44] this hate is not of God as Amos said
[6:47] hate the evil and love the good that's
[6:49] not the hatred that's referred to here
[6:50] that is a work of the flesh this hatred
[6:52] is not of God it's that which is
[6:54] opposite and against love so there's a
[6:57] hatred that complement love and that
[6:59] that's we've acknowledged that we even
[7:00] spent some time on that earlier this
[7:02] year but now we're looking at a hate
[7:04] that is actually not a compliment but
[7:05] against and contrary to love it's
[7:08] actually opposes love and this love is
[7:11] rooted in human passions and emotions uh
[7:13] it's based upon our own human
[7:15] perceptions and opinions and our own
[7:17] judgment as Amos said establish judgment
[7:19] in the gate it's not your opinion but
[7:21] Justice righteousness the right things
[7:24] and so these this is uh this hatred is
[7:27] rooted in our human ideas and opinions
[7:29] and the fruits of it are wrath and
[7:31] disgust and H I can't stand that and I
[7:34] wish this would happen I wish that would
[7:35] happen that's what we're talking about
[7:37] when we talk about hatred uh take into
[7:40] consideration all the things that the
[7:41] Bible says especially in 1 Corinthians
[7:43] 13 what love is and how that love is
[7:46] patient and it's kind and that love is
[7:48] not proud it's not arrogant it's not
[7:50] self-serving and all these descriptions
[7:52] of Love inform us about what love is but
[7:54] we can also invert and understand those
[7:57] are the negatives are true of hate
[8:00] that it is prideful it's arrogant it's
[8:01] selfish it's all those things it's not
[8:03] patient it's not it's destructive it
[8:06] doesn't believe all things and hope for
[8:08] all things it it it this is it's the
[8:10] opposite in that way to to love and so
[8:13] hate is prideful it's arrogant it's it's
[8:15] wrathful it's driven by disgust and it's
[8:18] self-serving it's very
[8:20] selfish and in Galatians when it says
[8:24] hatred it's talking about the cause of
[8:26] hate or the cause of enmity or com
[8:28] combative
[8:29] means to be hated or odious opposing
[8:32] another this is a work of the flesh for
[8:35] hatred and this word hatred is very
[8:36] unique in the New Testament I find a
[8:39] different word in the Old Testament but
[8:40] yet the same meaning Rings true in
[8:42] Matthew Chapter 13 in the parable the SE
[8:45] when the the the one that went out and
[8:47] sowed the Bad Seed Jesus calls that one
[8:50] the enemy and the word that's used there
[8:52] is the ha a hater or it's tied to this
[8:56] is the wck this one that did the enemy
[8:58] is the devil
[8:59] and the word their enemy comes from this
[9:02] very word hatred it's described as
[9:04] hatred here in Galatians 5:20 but the
[9:06] devil is associated with hate and that's
[9:09] what we looked at on Wednesday night
[9:10] about the Genesis and the origin of hate
[9:12] that there's a hate that is a fleshly
[9:14] emotion that traces right back to Cain
[9:17] traces right back to the Devil Himself
[9:19] and so as we look at that word hate also
[9:22] think in terms of enemies opposing uh
[9:25] Warfare in Acts
[9:27] 13:10 and Paul saying oh full of all
[9:30] subtlety and all Mischief thou child of
[9:32] the devil thou enemy of all
[9:34] righteousness wilt thou not cease to
[9:36] pervert the right ways of the Lord and
[9:40] this enemy of all righteousness this
[9:42] word enemy is connected to this word
[9:44] enity or hatred and it's an enemy of
[9:47] righteousness it's a hater of
[9:50] righteousness why why is why is this
[9:52] evil an enemy to righteousness because
[9:54] evil hates
[9:56] righteousness therefore it's an enemy
[9:58] and it says will not not cease to
[9:59] pervert the right ways of the
[10:01] lord it's it's this hatred that perverts
[10:04] and destroys and corrupts James writing
[10:07] it this way in James 4:4 ye adulterers
[10:10] and adulteresses know you not that the
[10:12] Friendship of the world is enity with
[10:14] God it's hatred to God he says whosoever
[10:18] therefore be a friend of the world is
[10:19] the enemy of God this is this is
[10:23] speaking of opposition and things that
[10:25] are contrary and things that are
[10:26] combative and uh that that pervert the
[10:29] right ways of the Lord You're an enemy
[10:31] to God and so the hate that we're
[10:33] wanting to address the Genesis of this
[10:36] hate is
[10:37] evil and there we must have a so I can
[10:40] put it this way there's a uh there's you
[10:44] can hate evil or you can have an evil
[10:46] hate good amen and remember if you hate
[10:48] evil it has to be rooted in the right
[10:50] the love for good so this Genesis of
[10:52] this evil there's a pure hatred for evil
[10:55] but there's also an evil hate and we're
[10:56] addressing this evil hate that grips us
[10:58] sometimes and I'm wanting you to
[11:00] understand its destructive nature
[11:03] brother baman referring to uh this
[11:06] scripture here in Galatians and he
[11:07] quotes off the works of the flesh he
[11:09] says and the fruit of the enemy is
[11:11] enmity hatred malice strife and so forth
[11:15] so there's a a grouping together of a
[11:17] lot of words we might say hate and we
[11:19] might say anger or malice or Strife or
[11:21] contention a and those words I want to
[11:24] group them together they're Associated
[11:25] together with hatred and he says the
[11:27] fruit of the enemy is enmity hatred
[11:30] malice strife and so forth that's the
[11:32] fruit of the enemy it's a fruit of hate
[11:35] it's the fruit of these emotions we're
[11:36] talking about and and just to kind of
[11:39] reset here the origin of hate is the
[11:44] devil right we saw that in the garden we
[11:46] see it then coming up in in Cain towards
[11:49] Abel and we hate this evil hate we have
[11:52] that when we've left love so hate is
[11:55] only possible when the love leaves a
[11:57] vacuum or we move away away from love
[11:59] and we create a vacuum and hate can
[12:00] enter there this evil hate can enter
[12:02] there and it can begin to work so we can
[12:05] only have evil hate where love isn't
[12:07] reigning Supreme and so when we have
[12:09] that hate once we hate it's hate that
[12:12] robs us of our peace so as long as you
[12:14] have love and you're channeled correctly
[12:16] there's all these fruits of the spirit
[12:18] that we can enjoy but once you give a
[12:20] vacuum and hate enters in hate now
[12:22] having taking it Taking the place of
[12:24] love and we move just a little left of
[12:26] center it's there that
[12:29] robs us and steals from us our
[12:32] peace that that I think that kind of
[12:34] gets us all on the same page this
[12:36] morning now if you turn to Proverbs
[12:38] chapter
[12:39] 15 vers 17 and
[12:42] 18 I want to start looking at this nasty
[12:44] side of
[12:47] hate and asking the question where's the
[12:51] strength where's your power what's the
[12:54] source of your power how is it that we
[12:55] can overcome we know that the Bible
[12:58] teaches us the word teaches us that
[13:00] Christ overcame all by the word and
[13:03] humility in Proverbs 15:1 17 better is a
[13:07] dinner of herbs where love is than a
[13:10] stalled ox and hatred
[13:13] therewith the plainest of meals with
[13:15] peace is preferred over the most
[13:17] delicious food with Strife or with hate
[13:20] just a plain language it's better to
[13:21] have a dinner of herbs it's better to
[13:23] have a dinner of herbs that are are
[13:24] simple they're easily grown they're
[13:26] readily available you just go pick some
[13:27] off and too bitter we'll eat that it's
[13:30] better just to have something like that
[13:32] something that all common people could
[13:34] have something that you can grow without
[13:36] effort it's better to have a dinner
[13:37] solely of herbs where love is than a
[13:40] stalled Ox which is referring to an ax
[13:43] that's been fattened this would be the
[13:44] highest form of entertainment in the
[13:46] scripture this would be putting on the
[13:47] dog as brother Barry would say this
[13:49] would be the biggest most extravagant
[13:51] thing you could do as a host and it's
[13:53] saying it's better just to eat measly
[13:55] herbs that you pull out of the ground
[13:57] that you don't even grow yourself self
[13:59] than to eat the best food with
[14:03] hatred and it connects it to the verse
[14:06] next verse is connected with it a
[14:08] wrathful man stirreth up Strife but he
[14:10] that is slow to anger appeaseth Strife
[14:13] amen so this hatred love then is looked
[14:16] at as kind of this opposite of what will
[14:19] uh what will smooth out and what will be
[14:21] consolatory and and be willing to to
[14:24] seek peace and restore and to keep
[14:26] things in the right Channel and the
[14:28] right at atmosphere but this hatred now
[14:30] is associated with wrath and strife and
[14:34] anger and it is better to eat a plain
[14:38] meal of the poor with peace and love
[14:41] than it would be to have great wonderful
[14:43] things and entertainment enjoy life with
[14:46] hatred because hate stirs up contention
[14:49] hate stirs up competition and and envy
[14:52] and strife it stirs up confusion in
[14:54] every evil work and when you read this
[14:55] some of you are thinking that's our
[14:57] Thanksgiving Day scripture
[15:00] right this describes this should be the
[15:02] what we should we should send out Happy
[15:04] Thanksgiving cards and put the scripture
[15:06] on it h because it so readily captivates
[15:09] some people's dread of Thanksgiving
[15:11] because you sit down and man you've
[15:13] worked for days to put on this great big
[15:15] beautiful meal and people just
[15:17] fight and they they argue and they come
[15:20] up with things to be competitive about
[15:22] and they saying that it's better the
[15:24] Bible's telling us long before there was
[15:25] Thanksgiving meals that it's better just
[15:27] to eat a simple meal with love than it
[15:30] would be to put on Thanksgiving dinner
[15:32] with strife and
[15:34] hatred and it just doesn't say at one
[15:37] time it Revisited it later in Proverbs
[15:39] 17:1 better is a dry morsel in quietness
[15:42] therewith peace tranquility than a house
[15:45] full of sacrifices with
[15:48] Strife this is remarkable equivocation
[15:52] this to me is such an outstanding
[15:54] comparison and contrast it's better to
[15:57] have a dry mold and this would be
[15:59] referred to bad bread it's better to
[16:01] have bad bread in peace than a house
[16:04] full of sacrifices with Strife
[16:08] right and this might turn this might be
[16:11] turning some of our paradigms around or
[16:13] maybe just reminding of us what our real
[16:15] Paradigm is when we're seeking after
[16:18] things to make life better we're seeking
[16:19] after things that give us uh more
[16:21] Capital to purchase the things we want
[16:23] and we're able to accumulate a house
[16:25] full of sacrifices we're able to have
[16:28] what it says are stalled Ox every night
[16:29] for dinner and we might have the this
[16:32] kind of finery and these wonderful
[16:33] amenities to life but yet what does it
[16:35] come with because that's not preferred
[16:37] over having nothing but dried bread and
[16:39] bitter herbs but with Tranquility
[16:41] quietness and peace and love because
[16:44] where there's strife and anger it
[16:46] doesn't make it worth
[16:47] it and the the comparison that's being
[16:50] made here is how that boo that excuse me
[16:52] food maybe there is boo but food is good
[16:56] food is good for the body it's it food
[16:59] is the body's source of
[17:01] energy where we in the Bible meat and
[17:04] bread sometimes are just being used to
[17:05] refer to solely the things that we eat
[17:08] to Su sustain ourselves and so food is
[17:11] how the body gets energy for life it's
[17:13] where it gets its nutrients for strength
[17:15] and for
[17:16] Vitality uh how can you how can you have
[17:19] power if you haven't eaten your meat
[17:21] might be the question and so you have to
[17:24] you have to eat and you have to give
[17:25] your body these nutrients if you're not
[17:27] eating food your body is not going to
[17:29] have energy or strength and so it's it's
[17:32] important and that and I want you to
[17:34] recognize what the Proverbs are doing
[17:35] here by you bringing food into The View
[17:38] when it says well eating this with love
[17:40] is better than eating this with hate
[17:42] it's wanting us to consider something
[17:44] about the dispos disposition and the
[17:47] nature of love versus hate and how that
[17:51] even if you're just eating a little with
[17:52] love it's better than eating a lot or
[17:55] better things uh with with hate
[18:00] in First Kings chapter 19:8 we read of
[18:02] how Elijah was there uh at the brook
[18:04] cherith and God sends these Ravens to
[18:06] feed him and and in his weakness and his
[18:09] Sadness the angel Lord touches him he
[18:12] says arise and eat and drink and the
[18:14] Bible says he went in the strength of
[18:16] that meat 40 days and 40 nights into
[18:17] horb the Mount of God showing that the
[18:20] the the this food this provision just
[18:23] these simple things that he received
[18:24] gave his body strength that's what food
[18:26] does it gives us strength the strength
[18:28] of that meat carried Elijah for 40 days
[18:31] and 40 nights and so when we read the
[18:34] Proverbs using dry bread in herbs with
[18:37] love being better and more preferred to
[18:40] a house full of sacrifices and a stalled
[18:42] Ox being slain for a great Sumptuous
[18:44] meal and great big entertainment these
[18:46] Proverbs are pointing to the destructive
[18:49] nature of hate right want us to
[18:52] understand that there is such a power to
[18:55] hate that if it's no matter what we may
[18:58] be eating physically thinking it's going
[19:00] to sustain us hate has the power to Rob
[19:02] us of the very strength we're wanting to
[19:04] get from the things we
[19:06] eat says in Proverbs 10:12 hateth
[19:09] stirreth up stries but love
[19:14] coverthe does a wrathful man stirreth up
[19:16] strife and but he that is slow to anger
[19:19] appeases Strife it's showing this
[19:20] contrast of how better is a dinner where
[19:22] love is where there's one who's slow to
[19:25] anger who will appease Strife who will
[19:27] look to Plate uh a contention and want
[19:29] to resolve things and not and be a
[19:31] peacemaker say this is better this is
[19:33] more preferred because hate stir up
[19:36] stries stir up
[19:38] contention and this hate and this is
[19:40] maybe my thesis statement hate steals
[19:42] our
[19:43] strength it's a LIF draining
[19:47] emotion we're supposed to be getting uh
[19:49] we're supposed to have energy and we're
[19:50] talking about physical energy we're
[19:51] talking about mental acuity and just the
[19:53] way the body functions and we're we're
[19:55] to have this just by a natural process
[19:58] but hate has the ability to interrupt
[19:59] the body's natural process and drain us
[20:02] of emotions hate is a toxin to our minds
[20:05] and bodies hate is a poison hate is a
[20:08] Venom and it attacks us even physically
[20:10] and emotionally and the Bible is showing
[20:13] us right here you'd be better eating
[20:15] just a little and eating stuff you can
[20:16] pull out of the ground with love than to
[20:18] be having all the best foods you could
[20:20] possibly eat and hate therewi because
[20:23] hate is
[20:24] destructive as we saw in the scripture
[20:26] peace leads to prosperity
[20:29] whereas the hatred leads to Warfare and
[20:31] hostility which leads to loss and
[20:33] destruction hate is destructive true
[20:37] turn to Proverbs chap 26: 21-28 with
[20:42] me we reading in Galatians how that Paul
[20:46] is saying that uh we should not use our
[20:49] Liberty as an occasion to the flesh but
[20:51] we ought to love one another and serve
[20:53] one another and that even the whole law
[20:54] is summed up in love thy neighbor as
[20:57] thyself but then he says if you bite and
[20:59] devour one
[21:00] another so maybe there's an eating that
[21:03] we do when we
[21:05] hate and this eating is something that
[21:10] counteracts and works against us because
[21:12] he says take he that you be not consumed
[21:14] one of so there's a consumption a a and
[21:16] there's a destruction that comes with
[21:18] this contention and strife and this
[21:20] language to me here is just so beautiful
[21:22] in Proverbs 26: 21 as coals are to
[21:25] burning coals and wood to fire what is
[21:28] that fuel coals to coals there's burning
[21:31] coals and you add coals then that
[21:33] ignites and the coal that is not lit is
[21:35] lit by the burning coals and as wood to
[21:37] fire you add wood to fire what does it
[21:39] do it fuels it makes it hotter makes it
[21:41] burn greater so is a contentious man to
[21:43] Kindle
[21:45] Strife what a a remarkable description
[21:48] contentious man is one who's judgmental
[21:50] or quarreling one who's adversarial
[21:53] contrarian maybe so is a contentious man
[21:55] to Kindle Strife that where you
[21:58] recognize that it's almost as if it
[21:59] describes someone who's just sitting
[22:01] there and all a sudden notices Oo we
[22:02] have a disagreement here well well
[22:05] didn't you say two people kind of argue
[22:06] well you did say this he did say that I
[22:08] heard him say it I can show you right
[22:09] here where he said it and then the guy
[22:11] gets mad he goes well but you did say
[22:12] that and you did say and they just love
[22:14] to see it get hotter and hotter and this
[22:18] contentious man he likes to stir up for
[22:20] Kindle which means to cause to burn or
[22:22] to be angry Strife is contention to
[22:25] content to dispute what is happening
[22:27] it's it's a it's a hater right this is
[22:31] exactly what so is he that contentious
[22:33] man do Kindle Strife dispute to content
[22:36] he likes to stir things up and now the
[22:38] just continuing to describe this it says
[22:40] the words of a tail Bearer are his
[22:42] wounds and they go down into the
[22:44] innermost parts of the belly these
[22:46] things are linked together I know they
[22:48] can stand on their own but these things
[22:49] are linking together burning lips and a
[22:51] wicked heart are like a postd covered
[22:53] with silver draws burning with hate and
[22:56] anger spe viewing out hatred and and
[22:59] threats maybe seeking revenge or trying
[23:01] to uh uh uh avenge something or seeking
[23:05] harm stirring up Strife wanting things
[23:07] to burn and this is this attitude of
[23:09] someone who's full of this rage or this
[23:11] anger or hate burning lips in a wicked
[23:13] heart it may speak certain things and
[23:15] express certain things it's like a postr
[23:17] which is just an earth and vessel
[23:19] covered with silver draw in other words
[23:21] there's no value at all in hate amen the
[23:26] burning lips in a wicked heart there's
[23:28] might be some pretense to it where it
[23:30] might be flashy and it presents itself
[23:32] of all this thing is silver this but
[23:35] what it is it's just Earth and Clay
[23:38] covered up in the dross of silver to
[23:40] make it look like something it's
[23:42] not that's what hate is there's no value
[23:46] in
[23:47] hate and you say well where are you
[23:49] getting this hate from verse
[23:51] 24 he that hateth dissemble which is to
[23:54] covers up it's conceals or hides
[23:57] dissemble with his lips and layeth up
[23:59] deceit within him he might pretend to be
[24:03] a friend but his hate will come
[24:05] out he that hates is known is saying he
[24:08] that hates is known by his words even
[24:10] the next verse shows us and hatred is
[24:13] full of
[24:14] arrogance hatred is full of Pride and So
[24:17] eventually it comes out no matter what
[24:19] the pretense no matter how words might
[24:22] be friendly and it might give this
[24:23] appearance it's like this Earth and
[24:25] vessel covered in silver draws it is
[24:27] what it is on on the inside he holds his
[24:29] deceit within him that's the holding
[24:31] place that's the vessel that holds it it
[24:33] says he'll he'll try to cover up he'll
[24:35] say things to try to to make it seem a
[24:37] certain way but just know he might
[24:39] pretend and sometimes hate might put on
[24:42] a lot of HS but on the inside there's no
[24:44] value to it says when he speaketh Fair
[24:46] believe him not for there are seven
[24:48] Abominations in his heart that brings us
[24:50] right back to hate right whose hatred is
[24:54] covered by
[24:56] deceit so where there's hate there's
[25:00] deceit they they go together his
[25:02] wickedness shall be showed before the
[25:04] whole
[25:05] congregation now that's what that's kind
[25:07] of amplifying how he dissembles with his
[25:09] lips and these burning lips and a wicked
[25:10] heart or like aost her it's kind of
[25:12] those few verses taken together say you
[25:14] know what hatred may appear one way but
[25:16] give it time it comes out because that's
[25:19] what it does and it's saying hate whose
[25:22] hatred is covered by deceit hate causes
[25:26] lying because where there's hate it
[25:28] it'll callous our conscience and our
[25:30] conscience is blinded by hate so we
[25:32] justify our line to the point to where
[25:35] we may not even recognize that we're
[25:37] lying I know this just gets real super
[25:38] practical all of a sudden we realize wow
[25:40] this is sometimes the reason why we act
[25:42] the way that we do is that the heart of
[25:44] it is hate and so we don't have a
[25:46] problem lying because we
[25:48] hate and the object of our hate said
[25:50] they're not worthy of Truth they don't
[25:52] deserve it why should I be honest with
[25:54] them why why why should I treat them a
[25:56] certain way the way they treated me and
[25:58] uh they don't deserve for me to do this
[26:00] they don't deserve for me to do that
[26:01] that's
[26:02] hate now this gets really really
[26:06] good talking about the hater and talking
[26:08] about hate who so diggeth a pit shall
[26:11] fall therein and he that rolleth a stone
[26:15] it will return upon him when you dig a
[26:18] pit it's a trap not for yourself but for
[26:20] someone else when it's describing he
[26:22] that rolleth a stone it's not referring
[26:24] to a rock band from the 60s and 70s I
[26:27] think there's still going 2020s but it's
[26:29] referring to an act of aggression or
[26:33] assault where you would roll a stone up
[26:35] on a hill to send it down upon somebody
[26:37] else of their property this is this is
[26:40] kind of shocking language but it's
[26:42] saying the one that digs a pit he'll
[26:44] fall into the pit he TR he laid a snare
[26:46] in a trap for somebody else he falls in
[26:48] it he rolls a stone up the hill in order
[26:51] to roll the stone down upon somebody
[26:53] else but he says it returns upon him
[26:56] it's showing us the destructive nature
[26:58] of the hate that we hold within
[27:00] ourselves with the deceit we carry
[27:03] within ourselves because it's saying
[27:05] that our hateful actions in the end only
[27:08] serve to harm
[27:09] us or if I can say maybe not only but in
[27:12] the end our hateful actions serve to
[27:15] harm ourselves hatred will build a pit
[27:18] but hatred will put you right in the
[27:19] same pit you you dug hatred will roll a
[27:23] stone on top of a hill to harm somebody
[27:25] else but the stone will only return upon
[27:27] you
[27:28] even if it has itself succeeded in
[27:30] harming somebody else hatred will always
[27:32] return upon the hater to harm the
[27:35] hater says a lying tongue hateth those
[27:38] that are afflicted by it we lie because
[27:40] we hate and it's saying we hate the ones
[27:43] we lie
[27:45] to a Lyon tongue hateth those that are
[27:48] afflicted by it and a flattering mouth
[27:49] worketh ruin I know there's a lot more
[27:51] that we could explore in this but we lie
[27:54] because we
[27:55] hate and we hate those we lie lied
[27:58] too now you might not think this is the
[28:02] the wisdom of the scripture you might
[28:03] not think I didn't lied to him because I
[28:06] hated him but you end up hating the one
[28:09] you lied to because you expect Revenge
[28:11] if they find
[28:13] out think of this what the scripture is
[28:16] trying to show us that you when you tell
[28:18] a lie it'll be the seeds of hate against
[28:21] someone that you love because the human
[28:23] emotions will begin to work up the
[28:25] defense and the explanation the justif
[28:27] and the story you want to build around
[28:29] it and it'll work you around to hate the
[28:31] one you've lied to expecting them to
[28:33] hate you to be mad at you and get
[28:35] vengeance upon you because you lied come
[28:38] on can I get a little bit louder amen I
[28:40] don't mind the Wows but this I know this
[28:42] hits home I I and but I I want this you
[28:47] to recognize just how practical the word
[28:49] of God is and just how much it exposes
[28:52] these things in our hearts and how much
[28:53] God desires for us to live free from
[28:56] these things that de base us and tear us
[28:58] down and harm
[29:00] us and the Bible's just calling it out
[29:02] you you you if you if you tell a lie it
[29:05] leads to
[29:06] hate you say well I didn't hate to begin
[29:08] with well just let it run its course
[29:11] it's what
[29:12] happens as we read before in Hebrews 12:
[29:15] 14 and 15 says follow peace with all men
[29:19] I think we only read verse
[29:20] 14 I follow peace with all men I think
[29:23] it was one of the core scriptures last
[29:25] Sunday and Holiness without which no man
[29:27] shall see the Lord work to understand
[29:29] others I think even how the the the word
[29:32] picture that's described there's
[29:34] cultivate a good understanding of other
[29:35] people don't just look them out on the
[29:37] surface and disagree with them need jerk
[29:39] and gr them off and get contentious or
[29:41] adversarial but work to understand
[29:43] others avoid Prejudice and envy don't
[29:45] feed the emotions that lead to strife
[29:47] and argument and fighting says follow
[29:49] peace with all
[29:51] men something that we ought to pursue
[29:53] after eagerly pursue after this
[29:56] piece and this peace we know is the
[29:58] opposite of hate it is the opposite of
[30:02] hostility and notice what we're told is
[30:05] it's telling us to follow peace it's
[30:06] telling us to flee
[30:08] hate because this is what hatred causes
[30:13] looking diligently verse 15 looking
[30:14] diligently lest any man fail the grace
[30:16] of God lest any root of bitterness
[30:19] springing up trouble you and thereby
[30:23] many be defiled where who is troubled
[30:26] the hater
[30:27] right and the hater is going to hate so
[30:32] it many are defiled by your hate but
[30:35] you're troubled
[30:37] too hatred causes
[30:40] bitterness hostility only grows our
[30:43] resentment this is connected now follow
[30:46] peace with all men in other words isue
[30:48] hatred don't hate because it'll cause a
[30:51] root of bitterness to spring up in
[30:54] you and trouble many yourself and defile
[30:57] many good amen this is I'm wanting to
[31:01] catch what hatred does now I think
[31:03] reading in Proverbs 15 and Proverbs 17
[31:06] told us a lot about hate and how it's
[31:08] going to take it steals our
[31:10] strength it robs us of our peace it
[31:13] steals our strength we saw how it
[31:15] inflames and imp passions and it causes
[31:18] things to escalate in Proverbs 14:17 he
[31:21] that is soon angry dealth
[31:23] foolishly when we allow our hatred to uh
[31:26] cause WRA or even we allow our anger to
[31:28] seep into a hatred he that is soon angry
[31:31] dealth foolishly and a man of wicked
[31:32] devices is
[31:35] hated we must not we cannot be quick to
[31:39] hate because hate breeds more hate he
[31:43] that is soon angry deal it foolishly and
[31:44] a man of wicked devices is hated hate
[31:47] breeds more hate it drags down it
[31:50] degrades if you could I hopefully I
[31:53] think all the scriptures we're continue
[31:54] to use this morning are going to
[31:55] emphasize this point
[31:57] uh Booker T Washington said it this way
[31:59] and it's so beautifully put I will
[32:01] permit permit no man to narrow and
[32:04] degrade My Soul by making me hate
[32:07] him what beautiful words this might be a
[32:11] better contribution than peanut butter
[32:13] uh to say I will permit no man to narrow
[32:17] and degrade My Soul by making me hate
[32:21] him amen let that resonate a little with
[32:24] you because he's pointing out as the
[32:26] scriptures are point out that to hate
[32:28] Narrows your soul to hate degrades your
[32:31] soul when you hate it shrinks you down
[32:33] when you hate it makes you it reduces
[32:36] your power reduces your integrity
[32:38] reduces your character I won't let any
[32:40] man narrow and degrade My Soul by making
[32:42] me hate him you cannot provoke me to
[32:45] hate he's identifying as the scripture
[32:47] does a man of wicked devices is hated
[32:50] that wickedness is actually trying to
[32:52] make you
[32:55] hate it's trying to provoke you into the
[32:58] wrong kind of
[33:00] emotions and it says that lest any root
[33:03] of bitterness spring and up trouble you
[33:05] this root of bitterness could have been
[33:07] translated to sprout of
[33:10] poison I know root of bitterness we
[33:12] might just think oh it's just something
[33:14] that's doesn't taste just right or maybe
[33:16] it's a little sour but this root of
[33:18] bitterness is a is a springing up of
[33:20] poison its companion in the Old
[33:23] Testament comes from the Hebrew rash
[33:25] which denoted the poison or Venom of
[33:28] serpents when Paul is writing he's not
[33:30] just merely saying that oh don't let
[33:32] something bitter and sour grapes and you
[33:34] know if life gives you lemons then make
[33:36] lemonade it's not just this kind of
[33:38] positive upbeat thing he's trying to rep
[33:40] pull away any Veil from your eyes to
[33:42] recognize just how nasty bitterness is
[33:45] or how how nasty hatred is he's saying
[33:47] lest a sprout of poison that poison and
[33:51] Venom of the serpent himself the poison
[33:54] of
[33:55] Satan yeah let it not spring up in you
[34:00] because it will trouble you and the
[34:03] sermon Christ is the mystery of God
[34:05] revealed brother bam brings it right
[34:06] down to this poison he says if the
[34:07] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[34:09] the sister say Lord don't let me have
[34:13] the root of bitterness springing up
[34:15] because it will affect
[34:17] him and it will take the Christ right
[34:20] out of my
[34:23] life that if you have a root of
[34:25] bitterness you're as the Bible told us
[34:28] in Proverbs 26 it's going to come out no
[34:31] matter how much you try to hide no
[34:32] matter how much you try to look like a
[34:33] silver a silver pot you're really just
[34:35] an earn vessel that's uh that's doesn't
[34:38] have integrity it's going to come out
[34:39] it's going to break am and and brother
[34:42] Bram backing it up says that we should
[34:45] not have a root root of bitterness
[34:46] spring up because it will defile
[34:49] others he says now this to me is the
[34:51] most important part because we say well
[34:53] the rooted will trouble you yeah I'm
[34:54] just troubled today no your trouble is
[34:56] that that it'll take Christ right out of
[34:58] your life it's not I'm having a bad day
[35:01] it's I'm having the worst of days
[35:03] because it takes Christ right out of our
[35:05] life he says that poison acids of malice
[35:09] and jealousy and hatred the Prophet The
[35:13] Prophet bringing us right down to what
[35:15] the root of bitterness means it's the
[35:18] poison it's a Venom it's poison acids
[35:22] that eat up and corrode poison acids of
[35:25] malice and jealousy and hatred you're
[35:27] the one that holds the malice you're the
[35:29] one that holds the hatred this poison
[35:32] acid is in you it'll just take the Holy
[35:34] Spirit right away from you amen it'll
[35:38] run him from the Tabernacle here it'll
[35:41] kill the spirit of God or drive it away
[35:43] from
[35:45] here those are strong words to recognize
[35:49] that these malice and jealousy and
[35:51] hatred this hate that we're wanting to
[35:53] use as kind of a cover for all these
[35:56] things that we're talking talking about
[35:57] it will poison
[36:00] you and drive Christ right out of your
[36:02] life he says they'll do it to a church
[36:04] amen it
[36:07] happens because these poison acids that
[36:09] phrase there to me is so
[36:12] descriptive Mark Twain said anger is an
[36:15] acid that can do more harm to the vessel
[36:16] in which it is stored than to anything
[36:18] on which it is poured amen that's good
[36:21] hatred will do more harm to you who
[36:23] holds it in your heart than the one you
[36:25] project your hatred too yeah it's a
[36:28] poison acid in your heart you're holding
[36:31] it In Your Vessel and after all you're
[36:33] just a poster you can't handle this acid
[36:36] you're not going to survive it you may
[36:38] think you're getting away from with it
[36:40] but it's eating at you all the while in
[36:42] eroding hate is a costic poison it
[36:48] erodes and when he says a poison acid
[36:51] this costic poison a poison acid as it's
[36:54] being described here it's capable of
[36:56] burning and destroying organic
[36:59] tissue it's
[37:02] corrosive hatred is costic it corrodes
[37:05] it's a poison acid he says that burns
[37:08] and destroys he says organic the even
[37:11] destroys our organic
[37:14] tissue now I'm I think the most
[37:18] important thing is to recognize how that
[37:21] hate will drive Christ out of your life
[37:23] who is our
[37:24] strength Drive the Holy Spirit right out
[37:26] of our life is upon which we rely upon
[37:28] which animates us and it's him in us
[37:30] both the will and to do of his good
[37:31] pleasure and it's through him that we
[37:32] have this strength and vitality and hat
[37:34] just comes in as a blocker comes as a as
[37:37] a dam to that fountain that we should be
[37:39] feeding from and that to me may be the
[37:42] most important highlight but there's
[37:44] also the the to further emphasize how
[37:47] hatred is a poison my original title
[37:49] that I began to work with was hate is a
[37:50] Cancer and I even wanted to maybe title
[37:52] a whole series not even cancer and just
[37:54] preach all of it on how hate is like a
[37:57] cancer it's a sickness in Proverbs 14:
[38:01] 29 and 30 he that is slow to wrath is of
[38:04] great
[38:05] understanding that this is showing that
[38:07] if you know how to control your emotions
[38:09] and and if you're not slow to anger you
[38:11] won't be quick to hate it's something
[38:13] where you're able to moderate and
[38:14] regulate and control you're looking at
[38:15] these things you recognize how things
[38:17] can spring up you even able to identify
[38:19] the seeds of hate and you know how to
[38:20] control that he that is slow to wrath is
[38:22] of great
[38:24] understanding but he that is ha of
[38:26] spirit exalteth Folly it's going to come
[38:29] out going to act a certain way a sound
[38:34] heart is the life of the
[38:37] flesh but Envy the rotness of the bones
[38:43] amen a sound heart is one that is free
[38:46] from hate or envy and evil passions
[38:48] sound heart is one that's not quick to
[38:50] wrath and one that's not Hasty to Spirit
[38:52] so a sound heart is one that's free from
[38:53] these passions and a sound heart these
[38:56] emotional seat a sound heart maintains
[38:59] the strength and the health of the body
[39:01] amen a sound heart is the life of the
[39:04] flesh so it's not just talking about
[39:06] your emotions anymore it's saying your
[39:08] emotions are a key to good physical
[39:11] health but Envy which is jealous or
[39:14] anger jealousy or anger against someone
[39:16] it speaks of anger and resentment and
[39:18] hate it says it it's rotness of the
[39:21] bones it rots your health good your hate
[39:25] may be projected to someone or something
[39:27] but it prays on your own body prays on
[39:29] your own Spirit it wastes the flesh it
[39:32] weakens and consumes the stronger parts
[39:34] of your bodies notice it says if you
[39:36] have this hatred in your heart it rots
[39:39] the bones the strongest part of your
[39:42] body the sound hard is the life of the
[39:44] flesh but hatred will rot even the
[39:46] stronger parts of your body one person
[39:48] called it the moth within W just lives
[39:52] inside eating things
[39:54] up and now I know this is very familiar
[39:57] to most of you we've dealt with this
[39:59] some when we were speaking on uh Christ
[40:01] my healer and we're dealing with
[40:03] forgiveness but hatred leads to other
[40:06] toxic
[40:08] emotions and hatred and well I think
[40:11] next Sunday maybe we'll touch on this a
[40:12] little bit more hatred is rooted in fear
[40:15] yes a a and with hatred comes an
[40:18] anxiety and this the these emotions that
[40:21] are all connected together that might
[40:23] start snowballing whether it begins with
[40:24] this and ends up with that we're wanting
[40:26] to look this whole picture these are
[40:27] things that stress the Mind begin to
[40:30] stress the body causing long-term
[40:34] physical health
[40:35] conditions causing long-term mental
[40:37] health
[40:39] problems because this anger this rage
[40:41] we're talking about this hatred this
[40:42] resentment and
[40:44] bitterness it'll actually cause more
[40:46] real harm than what we
[40:48] hate sometimes we hate something because
[40:50] we're afraid of what it'll do to us but
[40:53] our hatred for it sometimes causes more
[40:55] real harm harm to the very thing we're
[40:58] afraid of that's PR that makes sense
[41:00] right you're afraid this is going to
[41:02] hurt you so you build up hatred towards
[41:04] it you're building up resentment towards
[41:05] it because you don't want it to hurt you
[41:07] and it's your hatred that hurts you more
[41:09] than what you hate ever
[41:12] could because hatred is a costic poison
[41:15] it decays it erodes it destroys our
[41:17] spiritual and emotional and mental and
[41:20] physical
[41:22] health we know that uh This Hate as
[41:24] we're using it maybe as a catch off word
[41:26] but even anger I know you guys are
[41:28] familiar with this uh the the the
[41:30] physiological process in the body that
[41:32] hate causes the release of cortisol it's
[41:34] a stress
[41:35] hormone and it's the release of this
[41:37] hormone that kind of gives you the the
[41:39] the the energy the the uh Adrenaline
[41:42] Rush the energy that you need to in a
[41:45] particular situation and it gives you
[41:47] energy to run or gives you energy to
[41:48] fight it's kind of cortisol is what kind
[41:50] of kicks in as a survival Instinct so
[41:53] it's good but too much of it is bad
[41:57] and scientifically they' can bear this
[41:58] out and show it that this too much of
[42:00] this cortisol causes a multitude of
[42:02] negative effects upon the
[42:04] body and the scripture is saying it's
[42:07] rotness in the bones brother B calls it
[42:09] poison acids and Malice and and these
[42:11] things and this too much
[42:14] cortisol causes an imbalance all these
[42:16] different things imbalance in blood
[42:18] sugar it can suppress thyroid function
[42:22] and decrease bone
[42:24] density well I think the Proverbs
[42:27] already told us
[42:28] that go ahead measure the bone density
[42:30] of that person that's hating so much
[42:32] that's interesting their bone density is
[42:33] decreasing oh that's interesting the
[42:35] Proverbs told us that's exactly what
[42:38] happens it's a hormonal imbalance that
[42:42] impacts the body's immune system so now
[42:44] we're looking at hate as the root cause
[42:46] of your hurt of your sickness of your
[42:49] health
[42:51] problems this one uh study concluded
[42:54] this way research shows that chronic
[42:56] chronic angry people suffer more
[42:59] frequent colds flu infections asthma
[43:02] skin disease flareups and arthritis as
[43:04] compared to non-chronic angry people it
[43:07] sounds kind of politically correct
[43:10] non-chronic angry people we would call
[43:11] them
[43:12] mad people that are always angry people
[43:15] that are haters people that are negative
[43:18] peevish
[43:19] crotchety right that brother say I don't
[43:22] want my life to be crowned as a a a a
[43:25] critical a complaining old
[43:28] man and these things come to create
[43:32] these problems in the
[43:34] flesh we read from the sermon why in
[43:36] that series before I think we've
[43:38] probably read this quite a few times
[43:39] here at the church in just a few years
[43:41] says our number one heart disease so the
[43:44] number one Killer's heart disease says
[43:47] the main thing that kills the people
[43:49] today he said and he said it's one heart
[43:52] disease doesn't kind of the way he says
[43:53] it you see a little bit of the fragment
[43:55] but we know know that he's referring to
[43:57] what we believe to be the number one
[43:58] killer scientifically but he says it's
[44:00] number one sin
[44:02] disease why do we have heart disease he
[44:04] saying sin disease sin is unbelief
[44:05] unbelief in what the Bible that's right
[44:07] yes it's the number one sin disase that
[44:09] disease that kills the people today both
[44:11] spiritually
[44:12] and and that'll make them kill them
[44:15] physically of
[44:16] course because they can already prove he
[44:20] said this in 1963 they can already prove
[44:24] so there's some uh tracing this back to
[44:26] some sort of process that has determined
[44:29] causation not just correlation so they
[44:32] can already prove that man that holds
[44:34] grudges in women who fuss and stew this
[44:37] is this agitation this resentment this
[44:40] IR being irritated holding grudges this
[44:42] bitterness this hatred who fuss and stew
[44:44] and fight and
[44:46] argue they
[44:47] die it'll cause cancer fungus everything
[44:51] will set in
[44:54] ulcers brother bram's telling us this is
[44:56] the reality of hate this is the reality
[44:59] of grudges and resentment and bitterness
[45:01] that holding these feelings of hate and
[45:03] anger create as the scientists will say
[45:05] a chronic state of anxiety and stress
[45:08] and these things are toxic to your
[45:10] health and as you hold that and bear
[45:12] that in your body that elevates uh
[45:14] certain levels of hormones and cortisol
[45:17] and that's been proven to increase the
[45:19] risk of heart
[45:22] disease and this hatred we they've done
[45:25] a lot of stud and here they're calling
[45:26] it a chronic angry person again
[45:29] politically correct chronic angry
[45:32] people and you know hatred is deeper
[45:35] than
[45:37] anger and if anger will do that and it's
[45:40] not even being equivocated to hatred
[45:42] what will hatred do to
[45:44] us and as we covered before in preaching
[45:46] on forgiveness brother BR says they can
[45:48] already prove and we at that time we
[45:50] went through several studies over the
[45:52] past five decades since brother brownon
[45:53] made that statement research has
[45:55] uncovered a link between a person's
[45:57] physical health and their resentment and
[45:59] their bitterness and not being willing
[46:01] to
[46:03] forgive and we read in a number of
[46:05] places that people who are refused to
[46:07] forgive they're constantly angry they
[46:08] still hate they still want Vengeance
[46:10] that their health decays whereas people
[46:12] who were quick to forgive or learn to
[46:14] forgive had better health outcomes and
[46:16] they've amassed volumes and volumes of
[46:18] evidence of physical and psychological
[46:20] benefits of being able to forgive and
[46:22] there's a lot of connection between
[46:24] forgiveness and hatred
[46:27] as we read before this study on the
[46:29] effects of forgiveness from Hope College
[46:31] in good old Michigan it says forgiveness
[46:33] May free the wounded person from a
[46:35] prison of hurt and vengful emotion so
[46:37] now think of the opposite of what
[46:38] happens when you're when you still hold
[46:40] on yielding both emotional and physical
[46:43] benefits including reduced stress less
[46:45] negative emotion fewer cardiovascular
[46:47] problems and improved immune system
[46:50] performance we're dropping back just a
[46:52] little bit to get into the science of
[46:54] the scripture when it tells us better is
[46:56] a dinner of herbs where love
[46:58] is than a stalled ox and hate therewith
[47:02] because hatred
[47:04] corrupts hatred destroys brother Bram
[47:07] says it'll cause cancer fungus
[47:12] ulcers the sound heart is the life of
[47:14] flesh but the Envy is rotness of the
[47:16] bones it's a it's atic poison it's
[47:19] poison acid hate itself is a
[47:22] cancer it spreads and destroys healthy
[47:25] tissue spiritually and
[47:29] physically cancer grows new cells
[47:32] divides itself divides other cell the
[47:35] nastiness of cancer we're all familiar
[47:37] with probably in our own personal ways
[47:40] cancer has this ability to hide from the
[47:42] immune system some researchers call
[47:44] cancer
[47:46] Immortal because of its nature that's
[47:49] true one study said there's evidence to
[47:51] show that suppressed anger can be a
[47:53] precursor to the development of cancer
[47:56] and also a factor in its progression
[47:58] after diagnosis in 1975 they did a study
[48:01] and found that there was a statistical
[48:03] significant statistical relationship
[48:05] between extreme suppressed anger and
[48:07] breast
[48:09] cancer now you might say well this is
[48:11] this is stepping into the realm of
[48:13] science did we have we not given you a
[48:14] basis enough in the word of God to now
[48:17] realize that some of these Health
[48:19] outcomes can be traced to Stress and
[48:21] Anxiety hatred bitterness malice having
[48:25] an unforgiving
[48:27] heart and this hate now it's like a
[48:30] cancer I want us to recognize this
[48:32] solely how that hate is robbing us
[48:35] chipping away us it should be enough to
[48:36] know that hatred will drive Christ from
[48:38] our lives hatred to drive the Holy
[48:40] Spirit out our lives he says it'll it'll
[48:42] kill the spirit of God and drive it away
[48:44] from the church he said hatred is a
[48:46] nasty thing these poison acids of malice
[48:49] and jealousy and hatred oh don't let it
[48:51] ever be In Your Vessel amen cuz the
[48:54] spiritual consequences are enough and
[48:56] then look it also robs us of the
[48:58] strength and vitality of our natural
[49:00] bodies brother Brandon when he's
[49:02] preaching the revelation of Jesus
[49:04] Christ in 1960 he says little
[49:08] isms I remember before how we mentioned
[49:10] this about DC Stevenson he was the Grand
[49:13] Dragon of the Indiana Clan and grew it
[49:15] to the largest Clan membership and the
[49:17] most powerful clan in all the the nation
[49:19] was in Indiana and and he was expressing
[49:22] his ideals he said I did not sell the
[49:24] clan in Indiana on hatreds I sold it on
[49:28] americanism his success was praying upon
[49:31] people's
[49:33] fears and their desire to blame their
[49:35] problems on other
[49:37] people and they found other groups to
[49:41] blame things on and all he had to do is
[49:43] sell it on America
[49:45] first I did not sell the clan in Indiana
[49:48] on hatreds I sold it on americanism and
[49:51] brother B says little
[49:52] isms and little funny feelings around
[49:55] you for Brethren and things like that
[49:56] shake it
[49:58] away brother Bram was grew up in a hot
[50:00] bed of these things he was affected by
[50:04] it he saw it these little isms he says
[50:06] don't let no root of bitterness ever get
[50:09] into your
[50:11] soul if you do it'll canker
[50:14] you notice how brother Bram is telling
[50:17] us to think about what it'll do these
[50:19] root Ro of bitterness these little isms
[50:21] he says keep love I don't care how much
[50:23] people hate you you love them anyhow I
[50:27] don't care how much people hate you
[50:28] don't let them narrow and degrade your
[50:30] soul by making you hate them no matter
[50:32] how bad people treat you don't let them
[50:34] narrow and degrade your life and your
[50:36] strength and your power by making them
[50:38] hate you you hate them no matter how bad
[50:41] it is these little isms and funny
[50:42] feelings he says keep loving your heart
[50:44] don't let their hate turn you into a
[50:48] hater he says it'll canker you which
[50:51] means to corrode or corrupt and a canker
[50:54] was the original word word we used for
[50:58] cancer it is a spreading
[51:01] ulcer and brother Bram said they'll
[51:03] cause cancer fungus everything also said
[51:06] in
[51:07] ulcers because this is what hate is it's
[51:11] a
[51:12] cancer a cancer that prays on our
[51:15] strength divides our cells weakens our
[51:17] immune
[51:21] system in Proverbs
[51:23] 16:32 with in light of this hate hope
[51:26] seeing hate is the custic poison that it
[51:28] is in our bodies and our Spirits the
[51:30] Bible says he that is slow to anger is
[51:32] better than the
[51:33] mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit
[51:36] than he that taketh a city amen there's
[51:38] a lot of different ways you could say
[51:40] this but let's just say it's easier to
[51:41] subdue the enemy without right than it
[51:44] is the Enemy
[51:48] Within it's easier to hate than to
[51:51] love and the
[51:54] enemy is the hate an enemy there is
[51:56] associated when there's hate you've made
[51:58] something in your enemy you've made
[51:59] yourself an enemy to someone else just
[52:02] by your hate does it require the other
[52:04] person to hate right you say the enemy
[52:06] of my enemy is my friend is the way some
[52:08] people say it if you hate somebody then
[52:11] you're the enemy to them and you've made
[52:14] them your enemy even if there's no hate
[52:15] in their heart they're not the really
[52:17] the enemy or the hater it's in
[52:20] you he that is slow to anger is better
[52:22] than the mighty and he that ruleth his
[52:24] Spirit than he that take the city many
[52:27] warriors have con conquered their
[52:29] enemies only to fall victim to their own
[52:32] passions it said even of Alexander who
[52:35] could conquer Kingdom after Kingdom
[52:37] after Kingdom but he let his own hatred
[52:38] and rage caus him to kill his most
[52:40] trusted and best
[52:42] friend one saying put it this way he's
[52:44] more of a hero who has conquered himself
[52:47] than he who has taken the best fortified
[52:50] City you're more of an overcomer you're
[52:52] more of a conqueror when you could
[52:54] conquer yourself amen when you can
[52:56] overcome these emotions when you can
[52:57] begin to recognize them and be slow to
[52:59] wrath and you can begin to recognize how
[53:01] the devil's trying to provoke you listen
[53:04] I would not want any of you to be
[53:05] condemned If you experience anger and
[53:07] wrath and jealousy and envy or even
[53:08] hatred I'm just want you to recognize
[53:10] how that you ought to by The Life of
[53:12] Christ that's inside of you deal with
[53:14] those things and address those things in
[53:16] your heart because those things are the
[53:17] root cause of a lot of other
[53:21] things we have to come to that place
[53:23] where we recognize where our power lies
[53:26] and what we want to have power over and
[53:28] how we want to channel the energy of the
[53:30] Holy Spirit and not just giving vent to
[53:32] our hatred giving vent to our malice
[53:34] giving vent to how we feel about certain
[53:36] things just looking for some kind of
[53:37] Outlet or Channel but we want to be slow
[53:39] to anger we want to rule our Spirits
[53:42] because he who can rule his own spirit
[53:44] is stronger and more of an overcomer
[53:47] more Victor victorious than one who
[53:48] could actually conquer a
[53:50] city you're a better
[53:53] Warrior when you can can control your
[53:56] temper you're stronger you're more
[53:59] healthy when you can rule your own
[54:01] Spirit Amen brother BR in the Seal of
[54:04] the Antichrist we're coming to uh we're
[54:06] coming to our close here if that means
[54:08] anything to
[54:09] you in the Seal of the
[54:12] antichrist's dealing with physical
[54:14] workup and emotion he says not because
[54:15] we dance or we're happy or shouting that
[54:18] doesn't mean I mean it the fruits of the
[54:20] spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
[54:22] goodness gentleness patience that's it
[54:24] people shout dance in the spirit and
[54:28] hate their neighbor and refuse to speak

[54:39] your
[54:40] neighbor and what has all this what good
[54:43] has all this been all the exercise all
[54:46] the workup all the display it was

[54:53] he's saying you could do all that and
[54:54] look great big and powerful oh my
[54:56] goodness the holy spirit's moving so
[54:58] strong but then you just walk right out
[54:59] the door and hate your neighbor where's
[55:01] the victory in that won't speak to one
[55:03] another where's the power and that
[55:05] that's why I asked the question where's
[55:07] the
[55:07] strength where's the real overcoming
[55:11] where's the real power what are we
[55:12] looking for to know that the power of
[55:15] God is working in my life where are we
[55:16] looking to know that the word of God is
[55:18] effective in my life where are we
[55:20] looking to know that the strength of God
[55:22] is at the heart of my life amen what
[55:25] litus test do we use we come to church
[55:28] just so full of rage and hatred and
[55:31] we're so Ste oh my goodness If I Could
[55:33] Just Kill Them I would kill him if I
[55:35] could if I wasn't a Christian if if they
[55:36] didn't have so much science today to
[55:38] figure this out CSI if I you didn't
[55:40] exist kill
[55:42] him and so the music gets to move and
[55:44] you're like yeah yeah you get all pumped

[56:08] lengthy statement here from God hiding
[56:09] himself in Simplicity than revealing
[56:11] himself in the same I don't have this uh
[56:13] the quote here I may have another slide
[56:16] or two uh on this but just just stay
[56:19] focused with me as we wrap this
[56:21] up all right and he's talking about
[56:23] these extremes and these sides he says
[56:24] other can go so far as to be Fanatics
[56:27] now they go on the other side so you
[56:28] might have those stayed anti-
[56:31] emotion dry-eyed confessions kind of
[56:34] just some way that maybe it might be
[56:35] described maybe some might call it a
[56:37] fundamentalist or intellectualism
[56:40] whatever the ism people might want to
[56:41] put in a category but you do have the
[56:42] wrong extremes and I said but then
[56:45] there's another side which is just as
[56:46] bad as the other side right they're just
[56:48] might as well just realize they're both
[56:49] in the same thing they just have
[56:51] different ways of seeing it said I think
[56:53] that just because they they and they
[56:55] think just because they jump up and down
[56:56] and get some kind of sensation or
[56:57] emotion speak with tongues or give a
[56:59] prophecy that happened to be right
[57:00] happen to be right like a broken clocks
[57:03] right twice a day or something like that
[57:05] they think that it's that they've got it
[57:07] but it isn't Jesus said many will come
[57:09] to me in that day say Lord have I not
[57:11] prophesied in your name your name done
[57:12] many wonderful works and cast out Devils
[57:14] he said depart I never knew you that
[57:16] isn't it that isn't it friends that's
[57:18] the reason that tongues tongues evidence
[57:21] I believe in speaking in tongues but I
[57:23] don't take it to be the only of the Holy
[57:25] Spirit no sir the fruit of the spirit is
[57:28] the evidence right he amplifies this
[57:30] quite a bit you see that's the reason I
[57:32] have different with the move of the
[57:33] Pentecostal bre in the manner that they
[57:34] say if a man speaks in tongues he has
[57:36] the Holy Ghost I different that's no
[57:38] sign he's got the Holy Ghost I've heard
[57:40] Devils speak with tongues just as fast
[57:42] as they could drink blood out of a human
[57:43] skull and call on the devil I've seen
[57:46] Indians take snakes and wrap around them
[57:47] in the rain dance out there in Arizona
[57:49] hold their hands up like that and run
[57:51] right around the witch doctor come out
[57:53] Lancing himself lay a pencil down and it
[57:55] write in unknown tongues and give the
[57:56] interpretation so don't tell me that no
[57:59] I'm too old for that the fruit of the
[58:02] spirit is Jesus said by their fruits not
[58:04] tongues or emotions but by their fruits
[58:06] you shall know them so the fruit of the
[58:10] spirit it's God unfolding himself in
[58:14] humility sweetness and every day the
[58:17] same amen it's something about a man
[58:20] that stays right with the word this is
[58:22] the real evidence he's showing us stays
[58:24] right with the word every time that he
[58:25] sees the word he punctuates it with an
[58:26] amen no matter what the other people say
[58:28] he believes it
[58:30] amen what is it unfolding in humility
[58:33] and sweetness amen but we go far enough
[58:36] than to rest upon a fanatical and Satan
[58:39] gets amongst the people that's Satan's
[58:41] business and he's a good
[58:43] businessman and he gets amongst the
[58:46] people notice this is how he works gets
[58:48] amongst the people to make them think
[58:50] they've got it because they can jump up
[58:52] and
[58:52] down and then hate your
[58:57] neighbor now how Bram just quickly comes
[59:00] in with an
[59:01] objection and it's it's really as you
[59:04] could see some of this it's one
[59:06] objection yes okay fine you're you're
[59:08] claiming that this is genuine and this
[59:10] is real and you're having a Revival and
[59:11] everything's great and everything's
[59:12] wonderful and because you can jump
[59:14] manifest in all these physical ways he
[59:17] says but do you still hate your neighbor
[59:19] good because if you do that's not what
[59:21] it is because you can have all that and
[59:24] not have anything but when you can have
[59:26] a genuine love of God for his word
[59:28] that's it no matter what what no matter
[59:30] what it's looking like in terms of how
[59:32] it compares to this over here that's
[59:34] what you want is
[59:36] this God unfold himself in humility and
[59:39] sweetness hatred usurps our
[59:43] humility and because it hatred taking
[59:46] away our humility it strips us of our
[59:48] power amen because brother Bram says
[59:50] power is in sweetness and humility so
[59:54] brother said God unfold himself in
[59:56] humility and Sweetness in other words
[59:57] God unfold himself in power and power he
[1:00:00] said is in sweetness and humility says
[1:00:04] in another place if anything that we
[1:00:05] want to be is humble because that's the
[1:00:08] secret to power is through
[1:00:11] humility but just as love is humble and
[1:00:14] love is not self-serving and love is not
[1:00:16] arrogant doesn't boast and puff up but
[1:00:19] hatred does and therefore hatred is what
[1:00:22] usurps and destroys and BS us of our
[1:00:28] strength as we close in Galatians 5: 22-
[1:00:32] 26 brother Bram keeps quoting this over
[1:00:35] and over but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:00:36] love peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:00:39] goodness
[1:00:41] Faith
[1:00:42] meekness you what meekness is not
[1:00:46] weakness meekness is power under
[1:00:50] control meekness is what Booker T
[1:00:52] Washington was wanting right that when a
[1:00:54] man is trying to get me to hate him I
[1:00:58] know I could and I know I could avenge
[1:01:01] and I know I could do harm and I know I
[1:01:02] could get back and I've got power to
[1:01:04] show this guy who he's messing with but
[1:01:07] meekness is power under control amen I
[1:01:09] mean if you really are Weak and
[1:01:11] Powerless and can be destroyed that's
[1:01:13] not meekness that's just reality but
[1:01:16] meekness is the one who when struck he
[1:01:19] could fight back but he turns the other
[1:01:22] cheek as if to say you don't rule me
[1:01:25] you're not my boss you're not in control
[1:01:27] of me and he he objects in a way that
[1:01:30] keeps his passions under control he's
[1:01:32] not going to resort to the same response
[1:01:34] he's not going to give himself over to
[1:01:35] hate and this is the fruit of the spirit
[1:01:38] that has something to do with our
[1:01:39] character something to do with way we're
[1:01:41] living Our Lives God unfold himself in
[1:01:43] humility and sweetness and every day the
[1:01:45] same staying right with the word of God
[1:01:47] meekness Temperance against such there
[1:01:49] is no law and they that of Christ have
[1:01:51] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:01:53] and lusts
[1:01:55] so it says if we live in the spirit if
[1:01:57] quickened as we did this in the Kingdom
[1:01:59] series if quickened then follow his
[1:02:01] guidance amen and all your tempers and
[1:02:03] all your thoughts and all your words and
[1:02:05] all his actions if having been quickened
[1:02:08] by the spirit live walk and be moderated
[1:02:10] and guided and led by the spirit because
[1:02:13] that is the
[1:02:15] kingdom he says let us not be desirous
[1:02:18] of vain Glory provoking one another
[1:02:21] envying one
[1:02:22] another desires of V Glory it's eager
[1:02:25] for empty Glory being petty peevish
[1:02:30] contentious
[1:02:32] argumentative don't be desirous of vain
[1:02:34] Glory vain glory is it's behind our
[1:02:37] contentions it's be behind our fights
[1:02:39] and our disagreements the vain Glory of
[1:02:41] being right vain Glory of getting it
[1:02:42] correct the vain Glory of getting things
[1:02:44] uh uh put in the right place for
[1:02:46] something that's just Petty provoking
[1:02:48] one or means to challenge one to a
[1:02:50] contest or combat envying one another
[1:02:53] prompted to Envy which comes from the
[1:02:54] base meaning to corrupt destroy or
[1:03:00] waste it takes our power
[1:03:02] away hate is a poison hate is a cancer
[1:03:07] that's drawing away resources
[1:03:10] spiritually physically emotionally
[1:03:13] mentally physically
[1:03:16] hate it could be that some of us at the
[1:03:20] very root of our biggest problems right
[1:03:21] now is this kind of hate good we just
[1:03:25] won't let it go we just won't give it up
[1:03:28] and it eats at us and eats at us and
[1:03:30] eats at us and maybe there's a lot of
[1:03:31] other things in our lives that are right
[1:03:33] and you're doing right things and you're
[1:03:34] doing things that you ought to do as a
[1:03:36] Christian and you can go back to the
[1:03:37] year and preview like I'm I'm going to
[1:03:39] church I'm paying my ti I'm giving my
[1:03:40] offerings I'm supporting missions I'm
[1:03:41] doing devotions at my home I'm doing
[1:03:43] everything I can and there's a lot of
[1:03:44] things in your right that's in your life
[1:03:46] that you're doing right but the holy
[1:03:47] spirit is saying now with that kind of
[1:03:49] basis with that kind of strength with
[1:03:50] that kind of experience can we not focus
[1:03:54] on on something that is a real
[1:03:57] problem and we put a bullseye on hate
[1:04:01] brothers if you could come to your
[1:04:02] instruments my last statement to you is
[1:04:04] from the sermon humble thyself I know
[1:04:06] that we've heard it here before and we
[1:04:09] can only operate as we let and God can
[1:04:12] only operate as we let him operate just
[1:04:14] th follow my words here as we don't have
[1:04:16] the quote there for you maybe he can
[1:04:18] only operate as we let him operate
[1:04:22] there's that yielding to him you know
[1:04:24] people want power and really don't know
[1:04:26] what power
[1:04:27] is where's the strength it's not an
[1:04:30] anger it's not an aggression it's not in
[1:04:33] boasting it's not in bluffing where's
[1:04:37] where's our power they don't really know
[1:04:39] what goes with it the Way Up Is Down
[1:04:41] always if you want Power see how humble
[1:04:44] you can get just get away from all your
[1:04:46] worldly thinking worldly thoughts of
[1:04:48] Vengeance and Justice and fairness and
[1:04:50] equity and wrath and anger get away from
[1:04:52] your worldly thing and humble P yourself
[1:04:54] before God and then you've got more
[1:04:57] power than the man that runs all over
[1:04:58] the building and makes a big lot of
[1:05:01] noise there's more power in
[1:05:04] that than all that others that we can
[1:05:06] see because you've been able to conquer
[1:05:10] Yourself by being slow to anger by
[1:05:13] ruling your own Spirit you've been able
[1:05:14] to conquer yourself and commit yourself
[1:05:16] to Christ to humble yourself before him
[1:05:19] that's really power you show me a church
[1:05:23] that's humble real humble not arrogancy
[1:05:26] a church just sweet Humble Church I'll
[1:05:30] show you a church that has the favor and
[1:05:31] power of God in
[1:05:33] it Arizona Believers Church no
[1:05:37] pretense no
[1:05:39] posturing no platitudes and platforms we
[1:05:41] try to present ourselves a a as being
[1:05:44] more powerful or better than something
[1:05:46] else just humble yourselves before God
[1:05:48] don't be arrogant don't be boastful
[1:05:50] don't puff yourself up he says a church
[1:05:53] that's sweet and and humble is a church
[1:05:55] that has favor and the power of God and
[1:05:58] he says that's right that's the thing it
[1:05:59] takes humility humble ourselves before
[1:06:01] God letting God just work through us
[1:06:04] don't have to make a lot of noise if I
[1:06:07] could just put it to you this way as we
[1:06:09] close that God I I've been studying in
[1:06:12] Psalms 27 so maybe we'll just move uh
[1:06:14] some of these scriptures of the
[1:06:15] principles there in Psalms 27 he says
[1:06:17] the Lord is the strength of My Life whom
[1:06:20] shall I be afraid he he found strength
[1:06:23] in Christ he found strength in God and
[1:06:25] it changed his whole approach to even
[1:06:27] his enemies and the host that encamps
[1:06:30] about him he didn't say I'm going to
[1:06:31] seek after an atomic bomb to hurt him
[1:06:33] and to hurt him and hurt him and destroy
[1:06:35] him and I'm G dig up dirt on him and dig
[1:06:36] up dirt on him and I'm gonna do this to
[1:06:37] him and do that to him he did it to me
[1:06:39] I'm going do it to him he just said I
[1:06:40] just want you
[1:06:41] Lord that's what I'm going to seek after
[1:06:44] just want you because God and he had to
[1:06:47] turn to him and yield to him and it's
[1:06:50] that one thing have I desired the Lord
[1:06:51] of God is the is my light and my Sal
[1:06:54] ation the Lord is the strength of my
[1:06:55] life so I will not fear he's my
[1:06:57] deliverer he's my Vitality he's my
[1:07:00] stength and he cannot dwell in
[1:07:05] hate and that's what brother Adam showed
[1:07:07] us when he said these poison
[1:07:11] acids he just takes a
[1:07:13] step takes a step away because he says I
[1:07:16] can't be there I can't be in that I'm
[1:07:20] not in that even if you're hating the
[1:07:24] right thing in other words you're hating
[1:07:25] something that is evil but if it's the
[1:07:27] wrong hate he can't be in
[1:07:31] it God doesn't blow up abortion
[1:07:35] clinics the devil does
[1:07:40] that God doesn't bully a sinner the
[1:07:43] devil does
[1:07:45] that God doesn't degrade and demean the
[1:07:48] devil does that but sometimes he's
[1:07:50] trying to use God's language to do it we
[1:07:53] shouldn't be drawn off Ides by
[1:07:55] it this hate is a poison acid it is a
[1:08:00] Cancer and I believe that as Believers
[1:08:02] nothing can stand in the way if we
[1:08:05] believe not even cancer amen let's find
[1:08:09] the source of source of our strength
[1:08:11] stand with me today
