[0:00] I thought about this and as brother
[0:03] Aaron has been preaching again on on the
[0:05] house of the Lord and obviously I always
[0:08] look introspectively and and into my own
[0:10] life and and and say God where does that
[0:13] fit me um in my own personal walk with
[0:16] you and then I begin to work out how
[0:18] does that fit in my home with my wife
[0:21] and my children and in in in our little
[0:24] sanctuary of our home and then again I
[0:27] continue to go outward how does that
[0:29] affect me in my life as I um conduct
[0:33] myself in the world in in the workplace
[0:36] and in
[0:37] public but I thought about our church
[0:40] here and I
[0:41] thought really in this scope of things I
[0:44] know we've um I don't know exactly the
[0:47] time frame brother Aaron um has that I
[0:51] know it's I think maybe coming up on
[0:52] three or four years but I think we've
[0:55] been here two years I would say we're
[0:57] still a young church it's still a new
[0:59] church
[1:00] church
[1:03] and um as my heart has
[1:09] um just been thinking about listening to
[1:13] to different tapes and and uh I've been
[1:16] reading a book uh 50 years in the Church
[1:18] of Rome by uh Reverend chiniki and um
[1:22] brother brandom refers to brother
[1:23] chiniki and and his books
[1:26] and and just the deception that he faced
[1:29] in the Catholic Church um as a Young Man
[1:33] growing up reading his Bible and how
[1:36] that that was uh so frowned upon when he
[1:39] became a priest was why are you reading
[1:41] your Bible and everything he did he
[1:43] pointed back to the Bible and he just
[1:45] began to see this this disdain for for
[1:48] the the reading of the word and so forth
[1:51] and but it was the one thing that he
[1:53] would always refer to and he would see
[1:55] it he he would always look to the word
[1:57] of
[1:58] God but just that uh that deception that
[2:03] was all around uh and I just as I think
[2:07] about our church I think about this
[2:09] young church and as it's growing and I
[2:12] think oh God don't let those things
[2:14] creep
[2:16] in don't let those things begin to creep
[2:19] in and Lord if if it would come through
[2:22] me oh God keep me from it help hold me
[2:25] under the blood don't let me be a part
[2:29] of of bringing anything in that would be
[2:31] displeasing and would would cause a
[2:33] church to begin to go a drift and and go
[2:37] in a direction it shouldn't go whether
[2:39] it would be uh Traditions or or
[2:41] something baggage I would bring from my
[2:44] past um I know many of us have come uh
[2:47] probably the majority of us have been in
[2:49] other churches and we've we've come from
[2:51] other churches and now we're gathered
[2:52] together in this one place that we call
[2:54] a church and and it's just like well
[2:57] here we are so let's make this work but
[3:00] as we begin to pump the brakes a little
[3:02] bit and say you know we that's not why
[3:04] we go to church wait this is not why we
[3:06] go to church it's a daily walk this is a
[3:09] daily thing this isn't just a we want to
[3:12] get together every Sunday and we'll just
[3:14] do that for the next however many years
[3:16] we'll just do
[3:18] that we it it it it's a collective group
[3:23] of
[3:24] individuals and we each are bringing
[3:26] something into this
[3:28] place and as I think about that house of
[3:32] the Lord and and and and and making of
[3:34] that house of the Lord and and again
[3:36] this morning I'm talking about the the
[3:38] building blocks of the believer I don't
[3:40] know if do we have that image brother
[3:41] John of that that Lego man uh at the
[3:45] beginning I I I I figured the young men
[3:48] would really like that the young guys
[3:50] who love to build Legos think I could
[3:52] build
[3:53] that uh that's how I imagine uh the
[3:57] believer that's how I imagine us as as
[3:59] as as an individual that's made up of
[4:04] just lots and lots and lots of
[4:07] individual
[4:09] blocks and and and every day and every
[4:12] moment of our life we're adding a block
[4:14] and adding a block and adding a block
[4:15] and at first maybe you think I don't see
[4:17] the picture I don't understand what
[4:18] we're building here but as we go along
[4:21] this is this is what we're forming we're
[4:23] forming who we are and and and as
[4:27] Believers uh
[4:30] I think we would all say God let that
[4:32] image end up looking like Jesus Christ
[4:36] like Christ that's our
[4:39] desire and so I I I I've got to hurry
[4:42] along here and so buckle up and I'm
[4:46] hoping that we can do this quickly and
[4:48] we can get through this but as we're
[4:51] talking about the the the building
[4:53] blocks of the believer uh as we start
[4:55] with these if we can imagine as these
[4:57] Lego blocks and I'm hoping that I can
[5:00] just keep these young men alert and and
[5:04] and awake and and and and engaged in the
[5:07] service this morning get the if we can
[5:09] get the young people
[5:11] engaged then then the older ones you can
[5:13] you can drift off
[5:15] and and rest your weary
[5:20] bones but there's certain blocks that we
[5:23] like uh you open up your Lego set and
[5:25] you empty out the bag of the Legos and
[5:28] you start separating your Lego pieces
[5:30] there's certain ones that you you you
[5:33] you you go to the instructions and
[5:34] you're going to start with the the real
[5:36] long 2x6 block that's where you're going
[5:39] to start your base and and you're going
[5:41] to there's certain ones that you you you
[5:43] gravitate towards you say oh I like that
[5:45] block that's the one block you know I'm
[5:47] real good with these blocks and there's
[5:49] lots of little minute blocks that you're
[5:50] going to add to those bigger blocks but
[5:52] there's certain blocks that that you can
[5:54] get a hold of and and and even the
[5:57] youngest ones that start building on
[5:59] their Legos they they grab those real
[6:01] long ones those real long flat ones that
[6:04] look work as good paddles for know we've
[6:07] never done
[6:08] that but uh there's ones that you like
[6:11] to grab and and and you gravitate
[6:13] towards and the first block that that we
[6:15] would say that as a Believer the first
[6:17] block we want to build upon is that
[6:19] block of Jesus Christ is that
[6:21] Cornerstone Block it's it's Jesus Christ
[6:25] or we refer to Jesus Christ as the word
[6:27] because in St John 1:1 we find that in
[6:30] the beginning was the word the word was
[6:32] with God and the Word was God and that
[6:34] word was made flesh and that flesh was
[6:36] Jesus Christ and so that's the first
[6:38] block we were we're going to grab as
[6:40] Believers that's the block we want to
[6:42] start with and we like that block that's
[6:45] Jesus Christ that's the for the firm
[6:48] Cornerstone that we're going to build
[6:49] upon is Jesus Christ the word the Holy
[6:52] Ghost and then we're going to talk about
[6:53] that and and we're going to build on
[6:55] that one and everything everything we
[6:57] build on top of that we're always going
[7:00] to point back to
[7:02] that that no matter what we talk about
[7:04] in church what no matter what we talk
[7:06] about in our homes around a cup of
[7:07] coffee it's all going to be based upon
[7:10] the word that we as Believers are going
[7:13] to agree that the one thing that we're
[7:15] always going to point back to is the
[7:18] word not well my church said well my
[7:21] preacher said well this I heard you know
[7:24] I I I read this in a good uh uh uh
[7:27] devotional no no no no if it's doesn't
[7:29] line up with the word it's you you can
[7:32] bring it to the table but we're we
[7:34] really want it it the only thing that's
[7:36] going to be solid is the word is Jesus
[7:41] Christ we like that block everybody
[7:43] agrees we like that
[7:45] block the next block maybe we want to
[7:48] add to that is the block of prayer the
[7:51] scriptures tells us to pray without
[7:53] ceasing that that that that that no
[7:56] matter what we want we want to be
[7:57] praying and everything we do no matter
[8:00] what we do no matter what direction no
[8:02] matter uh what other block we want to
[8:04] add to our lives as Believers as
[8:07] husbands as Fathers as wives as
[8:10] housemakers as young uh young people
[8:13] excited about the Lord we want to be
[8:15] prayerful about
[8:19] it we want to we before we make a move
[8:22] we we want to ask God is this the next
[8:25] block I ought to be adding amen and so
[8:30] prayer is a is a block that is a key
[8:32] Block it's a block that we
[8:36] want we want to keep that one
[8:44] close how about the block of
[8:46] love we say oh that one yeah I wanted
[8:49] that one that's the one I wanted before
[8:51] prayer that's fine they're
[8:52] interchangeable those two blocks you can
[8:55] you can you you can put the love block
[8:57] before you put the prayer block if you'd
[8:59] like
[9:00] but love is a block that we say yes yes
[9:03] I I I I want the word but I want to
[9:05] bring the word in love I I don't want as
[9:08] as brother brandom uh has has well I I
[9:12] suppose as as I had preached here the
[9:14] last time I preached here about I think
[9:16] uh mechanics and
[9:18] Dynamics uh we we we we love the
[9:23] mechanics we we we will we want to be
[9:25] all about that but if we're not bringing
[9:27] the mechanics with the Dynamics and love
[9:30] being that main Dynamo that's driving
[9:33] us we don't that we don't want to be
[9:36] that we don't want that in our
[9:39] home we we don't want our children
[9:42] molded around because I said so that's
[9:47] why we want it we want it to be out of
[9:52] love we want God I I I it's because I
[9:57] want
[9:58] to
[10:01] I it's I abstain from certain things
[10:04] because I wouldn't want to hurt
[10:06] him that's that love of God that's
[10:09] that's the block we want to add we like
[10:10] that block I put in the block of
[10:13] committal and committ is a big one and
[10:16] and it doesn't get talked about a lot
[10:18] but the block of committal is being able
[10:21] to give it to
[10:23] God and leave it
[10:27] there to let
[10:30] go that's a big
[10:33] block that's a block that that we want
[10:36] to put in and then we want to take it
[10:37] off and then we want to put it on but
[10:39] then we want to take it off and we
[10:41] always want to take get we always want
[10:43] that block there but then we we we once
[10:45] in a while we want to go ahead and take
[10:46] it off the the pile but it's such an
[10:50] important lesson in life amen when you
[10:54] can learn to give your need to the Lord
[10:58] yes and leave it there we sing it all
[11:02] the time leave it there leave it there
[11:06] take your burdens to the
[11:08] Lord but then go pick it back
[11:13] up and then we wrestle and we wrestle
[11:16] and we wrestle and with time we learn I
[11:18] should have just left it he carries it
[11:22] so much better than I carry
[11:25] it we always want the the block of faith
[11:32] you know when we think about uh the
[11:35] stature of a perfect man at the base is
[11:37] Faith that's where we start we can't
[11:39] please him without it uh Faith the just
[11:44] live by faith there's just everything's
[11:46] built upon faith when we look at Abraham
[11:48] who is our father of faith and we see
[11:51] that it was it was by faith that that
[11:53] that Abraham acted and that's what
[11:55] pleased God and it was Faith uh that
[11:58] Abraham had that
[11:59] righteousness was accounted to Abraham
[12:01] by faith faith is a big block faith is a
[12:05] block that that that that even if you
[12:07] didn't have the word faith on your lips
[12:10] your actions as a Believer show that
[12:14] that's what you're walking by is the
[12:16] block of
[12:17] faith that well how are you going to do
[12:19] this how do you know this week is going
[12:21] to be it's by
[12:23] faith do you know how do you know can
[12:26] you prove it to me if I set up here I'm
[12:28] going to now I'm going to prove this to
[12:29] you could I really if I could prove it
[12:33] to you probably somebody could disprove
[12:35] it somebody much smarter than me but
[12:37] it's by faith that we as Believers are
[12:40] walking you say I can't prove it I don't
[12:42] know the scriptures I didn't go to the
[12:44] theological school to learn the
[12:46] arguments and but it's by faith that we
[12:49] as Believers walk
[12:52] right we like that
[12:56] block the block of forgiveness
[13:01] this is a block we want to
[13:07] add brother brandham was preaching
[13:11] about uh speak to the
[13:14] mountain and in the
[13:17] scripture Jesus is speaking about faith
[13:20] and if you had the faith of grain of
[13:23] mustard seed you could move a
[13:26] mountain but in that same
[13:29] context when Jesus is teaching about
[13:32] that kind of Faith he says when you
[13:35] stand praying
[13:38] forgive and if you can't forgive neither
[13:41] will your father in Heaven forgive you
[13:43] and brother brandom says faith is based
[13:46] on
[13:55] forgiveness well you know you need
[13:57] context with that
[13:59] that you need context with
[14:03] that but the idea is if there's
[14:07] something that's in your heart if
[14:09] there's something in your life and it's
[14:11] it's that
[14:13] hangnail and you just you just you don't
[14:17] even really so you forget about it most
[14:19] of the time but something will come
[14:21] along and it'll rub it and your nerves
[14:24] immediately you know it's
[14:26] there and it's something that that's
[14:29] you're harboring you don't even know
[14:30] you're har you know when when when it
[14:33] comes up you know it that nerve you hit
[14:36] that nerve and you know it but then with
[14:39] time and distance you forget about
[14:43] it but once in a while you catch it on
[14:45] something somebody will bring it up
[14:47] again and you the you can feel the heat
[14:50] rise in your face and you realize there
[14:54] so something that I thought I had
[14:56] forgiven it's still there
[15:02] it's still there and and then
[15:08] when when God that when the Divine
[15:12] healer when the Great
[15:15] physician deals with
[15:19] that and you're allowed you're allowed
[15:23] you are
[15:25] allowed but you're able to forgive yes
[15:29] the release that it
[15:31] has is so
[15:33] wonderful it's it's that hangnail being
[15:36] gone it's taking that hangnail off and
[15:39] and and you don't it doesn't catch
[15:41] anymore it's
[15:42] done and and and you can bring it up the
[15:45] subject can be brought up and you can
[15:48] talk about and you realize I didn't even
[15:51] realize it but it doesn't bother me
[15:53] anymore because it's gone I've forgiven
[15:57] amen
[15:59] as Believers that is a block that
[16:03] Believers have that the world is
[16:08] just they just bury it whether it would
[16:12] be with a substance abuse or or or or or
[16:18] finding you know like a py Psychopaths
[16:21] they have to continue to to to rotate
[16:23] and and move because they get discovered
[16:26] quickly their their pattern
[16:29] but that's what they'll do is they just
[16:31] want to move along and I well I'll just
[16:33] have to make new friends and they can
[16:35] never forgiveness is is a block that is
[16:39] something that
[16:42] Believers it
[16:46] it the world must Marvel at it well and
[16:50] and I would say because sometimes as
[16:52] Believers I Marvel at other believers
[16:55] who have told me their story and they
[16:57] tell me about the forgiveness and I
[16:59] think my just the grace of
[17:03] God that's just God that could do
[17:07] that we like these
[17:10] blocks now brother brandom in the church
[17:13] age book speaking about the temple and
[17:16] building this up because that's what
[17:17] we're talking about is the building
[17:19] blocks of a Believer and the idea is uh
[17:22] is joined with this idea of the house of
[17:24] the Lord and us being that house of the
[17:27] Lord us being that Temple for God and
[17:30] and so as bu the building blocks we
[17:32] don't want to just collect blocks we're
[17:34] wanting something to build we we're
[17:37] wanting to shape something up we're
[17:38] wanting God to make something out of us
[17:41] not just be a pile of blocks uh we want
[17:45] to we want to be again formed in the
[17:47] image of God we want to be his
[17:50] handiwork framed together to make up the
[17:54] body of Christ that's what we're Des
[17:57] that's the desire for each of these
[17:59] building blocks that we can add these
[18:01] blocks to be the image of God for the
[18:05] day and age we live
[18:07] in so brother brandom in the church age
[18:09] book in the Philadelphia Church age he
[18:11] says now he's not only giving crowns but
[18:13] he says that these and the bride will be
[18:15] made pillars in the temple of God but
[18:18] what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of
[18:20] his body as being the temple it was it
[18:24] was the temple of God but now that we
[18:27] are his body the True Church the true
[18:30] church is the temple of God by the Holy
[18:34] Ghost within us so you are that Temple
[18:37] and we would all say Amen to that now
[18:39] he's going to make the Overcomer a
[18:41] pillar in that Temple but what is a
[18:44] pillar a pillar is actually a part of
[18:46] the
[18:47] foundation for it holds up the super
[18:50] structure praise God that puts the
[18:52] Overcomer right in with the apostles and
[18:55] Prophets for it says in Ephesians
[18:59] 2 19 through verse 22 which we just read
[19:02] and uh you're you're no more strangers
[19:05] and foreigners but fellow citizens of
[19:07] the Saints household of God you're built
[19:08] upon the foundation of the Apostles and
[19:12] Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief
[19:15] Cornerstone yes that verse 22 says that
[19:18] we are build it together with them so
[19:22] when we think of Moses when we think of
[19:24] of of Elijah when we think of Paul and
[19:27] Peter and James you're in with them
[19:30] you're that kind of a Believer no don't
[19:34] SE separate them and say boy that Peter
[19:36] that Paul wow amazing that's
[19:39] you that's you when when when all of the
[19:43] the time is over and people begin
[19:45] talking about Believers don't be
[19:47] surprised if your name comes
[19:56] up I mean we do it
[19:58] I just want you to know that that we in
[20:01] our house uh we do talk about
[20:05] you I mean I'm glad that you all don't
[20:08] do that but we do that in our house we
[20:10] talk about you and we talk about how
[20:13] awesome it is that we get to fellowship
[20:16] with the people we get to fellowship
[20:18] with because we get to hear the stories
[20:21] when we as a new church come together
[20:23] and it's formed up of of of people who
[20:26] have come from all different walks of
[20:27] life different churches and why are you
[20:30] at this church you know there's another
[20:31] church you could go to that church and I
[20:33] was at that church but I left that
[20:35] church and why did you leave that church
[20:36] well because of this circumstance well
[20:38] let me tell you about what I came from
[20:39] and we begin talking about those things
[20:41] and you say wow these people are
[20:45] amazing what
[20:47] pillars in the temple of
[20:53] God now when God puts a man in the
[20:55] temple as a pillar and makes him a part
[20:57] of that Foundation group what is he
[20:59] doing he's giving him the
[21:01] revelation of the word and of
[21:07] himself let me let me back up so I can
[21:10] read that again now when God puts a man
[21:13] in the temple as a pillar so when man or
[21:16] woman okay the when God puts a man or a
[21:19] woman in the temple as a pillar what is
[21:23] he doing but he's giving him the
[21:26] revelation of the word and of himself
[21:29] that's what he's doing as a Believer
[21:32] he's revealing who he is to
[21:36] you that you as Believers walking with
[21:40] these other blocks as God is building
[21:42] you upon W with the with with the blocks
[21:44] of faith and of Love is you're saying by
[21:48] faith and with love I want to know
[21:52] him I want to know who he is how he is
[21:57] what he is and God begins revealing who
[22:01] he is to
[22:03] you that Revelation is solid that's what
[22:07] forms a temple a pillar because that is
[22:11] exactly what the apostles and Prophets
[22:12] had Matthew
[22:14] 1617 there he is that word there he
[22:17] stands no one can get him out Matthew
[22:19] 16:17 is Jesus saying to Peter and Jesus
[22:22] answered and said unto him blessed art
[22:24] thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood
[22:27] hath not revealed unto thee but my
[22:29] Father which is in heaven
[22:32] Revelation upon this I'll build my
[22:35] church Revelation that's one of the
[22:37] blocks we
[22:39] want that's one of the blocks you've
[22:42] got it's a good block you see I like
[22:46] that block and all these
[22:49] blocks all these blocks we think I like
[22:52] these
[22:55] blocks I like those ones I those those
[22:58] are the ones that I want I want more of
[22:59] those
[23:03] blocks but God's not building a square
[23:07] box you've got curves to
[23:10] you you have you have very intricate
[23:14] parts to you you're very
[23:17] unique some of us have got higher uh
[23:22] foreheads than some other of
[23:25] you some of us you know have darker skin
[23:28] than
[23:30] others you're very unique God's not
[23:34] building this and so you say I like
[23:36] those block but just give me more of
[23:37] those
[23:38] blocks but as a Believer really our
[23:41] desire is
[23:43] God it's it's your you're the handy man
[23:48] we're your handiwork and it's your It's
[23:52] Your
[23:53] Design we're not telling God well I want
[23:56] you to make me this it's what I don't
[23:59] know what you're making God but whatever
[24:01] it is I'm sure it will be great and he's
[24:04] like are you
[24:05] sure and you're like I'm
[24:10] yeah well what is it and he says well
[24:13] I'll show you'll see at the end what it
[24:16] is you you haven't seen the completed
[24:18] picture
[24:20] yet uh I got some I got some unique
[24:24] blocks though that you may not see them
[24:27] from the outside they're parts of those
[24:28] Legos that go on the inside and you
[24:30] think why did they have that Lego there
[24:32] at all you can't you can't I can't even
[24:34] see it from anywhere in this final thing
[24:38] but why is that block in there and he
[24:39] said there's a purpose for it we said
[24:41] well what what what like what and he
[24:44] brings out the block of
[24:51] sorrow in Isaiah 533 he is despised and
[24:57] rejected of
[24:59] men a Man of
[25:02] Sorrows and acquainted with
[25:05] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[25:08] from him he was
[25:11] despised and we esteemed him not we go
[25:15] oh
[25:16] yeah that's
[25:19] right this we came to church not to hear
[25:23] just about the blocks of love and
[25:26] goodness and happiness and
[25:28] comfortability here in this
[25:30] church but tomorrow and this week and
[25:34] maybe even right now there's somebody in
[25:36] here who their heart is bleeding
[25:43] right that maybe this is a reprieve to
[25:46] be here this morning because when this
[25:49] service is over they're about to go out
[25:51] to
[25:52] something that they wish they didn't
[25:54] have
[25:56] to
[26:01] these are the blocks that now we're
[26:02] going to talk about
[26:04] that gets real
[26:09] heavy but these are the building blocks
[26:12] of the
[26:14] believer and this block of
[26:17] Sorrow is obviously a necessary
[26:21] block because
[26:23] when God was prophesying of what he
[26:27] would would be yes when he came in flesh
[26:31] so that we would have an actual image of
[26:34] God in flesh he was a Man of
[26:40] Sorrows and I there I know I look out I
[26:44] can see the grayer hairs and the lack of
[26:49] hairs to know that some of you know
[26:52] exactly that
[26:55] block you know that block amen you're
[26:58] acquainted with that
[27:04] block there's a block of
[27:07] suffering and in 1 Peter 510 it says but
[27:10] the God of all Grace who hath called us
[27:14] unto his eternal glory by Christ
[27:17] Jesus after that ye have suffered a
[27:21] while make you perfect
[27:24] establish strengthen and and settle
[27:28] you we love the perfecting we love the
[27:32] establishing we love the
[27:35] strengthening we love the
[27:39] settling but the suffering that comes
[27:42] before
[27:44] that we don't like
[27:47] that but that is a necessary Block in
[27:52] the building of a
[27:56] Believer and I it's not that God's like
[27:59] oh here we
[28:00] go you know this is just good for
[28:04] you I hope you're ready
[28:08] no no he didn't design that he didn't
[28:11] design that he allowed that to bring
[28:14] about his attributes he didn't design
[28:17] that but he knew that what if he would
[28:21] allow
[28:22] that through the fall through through
[28:25] this this this great plan of his it
[28:28] would make a better
[28:31] believer that he would put within you
[28:34] the ability to overcome the suffering to
[28:39] to to endure the suffering and even more
[28:42] than enduring the suffering to conduct
[28:46] yourself with
[28:48] joy amidst the suffering that God has
[28:52] seen fit to allow in your life for you
[28:56] to be able to conduct yourself with joy
[28:59] now that's not happiness and skipping
[29:01] and dancing it's joy in the
[29:06] lord it's it's the when you're curled up
[29:10] in a fetal position terrified in your
[29:13] bed at home because of of the anxiety
[29:16] and everything around you there's still
[29:18] something in your heart that says I you
[29:21] know what I love the
[29:23] word you know what's so comforting to me
[29:26] is to hear the revelation of God in this
[29:30] day it's like but look at you're a
[29:33] you're falling apart you're on the
[29:34] outside you're a mess and it's like I
[29:36] know but I still got this joy down
[29:40] inside of
[29:41] me okay we're going to hurry
[29:44] along
[29:47] patience okay now I may skip over some
[29:50] of this but and I think I will brother
[29:53] John I think I'm going to skip over it
[29:54] but brother Brandon in the church H book
[29:56] he does such such a beautiful job of
[29:58] laying out God perfecting us through
[30:03] patience that it's through patience
[30:06] waiting for and waiting on God
[30:09] Amen in patience possess ye your souls
[30:13] it's that patience being
[30:17] able to be patient first with
[30:22] God first with
[30:26] God
[30:31] in the book Christ the Healer brother FF
[30:36] Bosworth you know brother FF Bosworth
[30:38] was brother brandom's daddy in the
[30:41] gospel he's the one that when at the Sam
[30:44] Houston Coliseum when when Dr best
[30:47] wanted to call brother brandom out and
[30:50] debate him brother brandom said I'm not
[30:51] debating brother Bosworth was like let
[30:55] me okay the reason Dr Bosworth was like
[30:58] let me was cuz he just wrote the book
[31:01] Christ the Healer he had just written a
[31:04] book where he had over 600 scriptures on
[31:09] Jehovah Gyra being Jehovah Rafa being
[31:12] Jehovah sh he had just gone through all
[31:14] of that to see that Jesus Christ was the
[31:17] Fulfillment of all of that and if you
[31:19] were going to De debate Divine Healing
[31:21] then you had to debate Divine
[31:24] saving and so he was just ready for it
[31:26] brother br brother BR said now listen I
[31:28] don't want an argument whatever but
[31:29] brother brother Bosworth in in his book
[31:32] Christ the Healer he said it's playing
[31:35] playing uh chess with God and God moves
[31:39] he he gives his word God says uh by my
[31:43] stripes you're healed that's his move he
[31:46] said now it's your move and your move is
[31:49] either I believe it or I don't know if I
[31:51] believe that that's your move and and
[31:54] that could go sideways that you know
[31:55] that could go a lot of ways depending on
[31:58] on how you move on
[32:00] that but then after you move let's say
[32:03] you say I believe
[32:05] that now it's God's move right but you
[32:08] don't get to tell God when to
[32:12] move oh that's the part that we just go
[32:15] oh I
[32:18] forgot this isn't Checkers this is chess
[32:21] you know and and so you know you you I I
[32:25] I sent my word I healed to heal them and
[32:27] you say I believe
[32:28] that go ahead he yeah
[32:34] yeah and you go
[32:39] [Music]
[32:42] patience but then when God moves boy he
[32:45] moves
[32:47] huh what a beautiful
[32:52] move the block of
[32:55] sacrifice in in Romans 12 and: 1 it says
[32:59] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[33:01] mercies of God that you present your
[33:03] bodies a Living
[33:05] Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God
[33:08] which is your reasonable service and you
[33:10] know there were so there's so many
[33:12] beautiful illustrations that brother
[33:14] brandham gives in through story form of
[33:17] course being uh biblical you know is
[33:20] scriptural but he dramatizes so much you
[33:23] know and and we love that I love that I
[33:26] just want know I love that I guess I'm
[33:29] dramatic and so uh one of those stories
[33:33] is blind
[33:35] bmus and uh brother brandom speaking
[33:38] about blind B marus in the message the
[33:40] faith that was once delivered to the
[33:41] Saints says then one day his wife took
[33:43] sick he walked out he was a Believer he
[33:46] believed God would heal he believed God
[33:49] was real he said Lord God my poor wife
[33:52] the doctor can do no more for her if
[33:54] you'll spare her life tomorrow I'll take
[33:56] these turtle doves and offer them to you
[33:59] for a sacrifice it's a hard
[34:03] thing we want to make the sacrifice out
[34:06] of well something easy see that's not a
[34:12] sacrifice it's something that hurts and
[34:16] cuts is what's a
[34:22] sacrifice you say well I got it you know
[34:25] well just so happened that I have it
[34:28] that's not how a sacrifice
[34:36] works the ministry explained brother bam
[34:38] says and the queen said I'll go see for
[34:40] myself the Queen of Sheba now I want you
[34:43] to notice what a sacrifice when you come
[34:45] to see God you don't just come on a
[34:47] flower bed of ease you have to make a
[34:49] sacrifice it's a sacrificial way it's a
[34:52] way of death you have to die out to come
[34:55] to him you have to forget all you ever
[34:58] know in order to learn of him empty out
[35:01] that he can fill us you don't mix it now
[35:04] you have to empty
[35:08] out
[35:13] oh you'll appreciate it
[35:18] later questions and answers say well
[35:21] I'll go I'd go to church and I'd praise
[35:24] the Lord if I felt like it well now a
[35:27] priest is to make a sacrifice and you
[35:29] the congregation are high Priests of God
[35:31] to make a spiritual sacrifice that's the
[35:34] fruits of your lips giving praise to God
[35:38] you go down and say well if I felt like
[35:40] it I'd go over and testify to somebody
[35:43] well do it anyhow if you're a high
[35:45] priest brother it's burning in your
[35:47] heart whether you feel like doing it or
[35:49] not do it anyhow because you've got to
[35:52] make a sacrifice something that's hard
[35:53] to do go do it anyhow you're a spiritual
[35:56] priesthood a royal people giving praise
[35:58] to God because God lives in this
[36:04] heart we know this as adults we know
[36:07] this that you know sometimes you you
[36:11] you've got to go and do something you
[36:13] say but man I really don't want to go
[36:16] and do I don't feel like but it's got to
[36:18] get done and we teach our kids that
[36:21] listen it's got to get done but I don't
[36:24] feel like doing it right now
[36:27] you you got to be able to override
[36:29] feelings in that case that's those
[36:32] senses right that's that if if the
[36:34] senses don't agree with the word we deny
[36:37] the senses a that's harder than it's
[36:40] it's you know like you can say it so
[36:42] easy it comes off the lips but the
[36:45] discipline to do
[36:47] that or the yielding to the spirit of
[36:50] God to do that however you want to
[36:52] phrase
[36:55] that
[36:57] it's one of the building
[37:00] blocks for a Believer yeah we
[37:05] agree there's other blocks there's the
[37:08] block of
[37:09] reproach there's the block of Holiness
[37:13] and I don't just mean
[37:14] dressing in a Holiness way I mean
[37:19] living in the way of
[37:22] Holiness it comes out it's it comes out
[37:25] in the appearance
[37:28] sure but it's a way of life easy oh
[37:34] no no not
[37:40] easy but worth
[37:44] it you know his yoke really is
[37:49] light if we'll just get our yoke
[37:53] off it's just we're trying to put his
[37:55] yoke on and this other
[38:01] Yoke the block of
[38:04] loneliness
[38:06] oh it's lonely sometimes you feel like
[38:10] Elijah Lord I'm the only one I think I'm
[38:14] the only one Lord and he has to pull you
[38:18] out and say I want you to know there's
[38:20] 7,000 they have not bowed the knee to
[38:25] bail but talk about loneliness does the
[38:28] believer know about loneliness oh too
[38:34] often I put the block of the
[38:37] Cross because Jesus said that we must
[38:40] pick up our cross and follow him and
[38:44] that idea of the Cross is dying
[38:48] out it's bringing everything it's the
[38:52] it's the X on the map to the treasure
[38:55] but it requires Ires
[38:58] vulnerability opening yourself up
[39:00] becoming
[39:06] vulnerable and dying
[39:12] out now the other day I was we were in
[39:15] our house
[39:19] and okay just looking at the
[39:23] time and my son Luke the 4
[39:26] yold was uh was on the couch and he was
[39:30] pulling the blanket was sitting with one
[39:32] of his siblings and he's pulling the
[39:34] blanket over his head and going oh the
[39:36] ghost is I don't want the ghost is to
[39:39] get me oh the ghost is no no no what
[39:42] ghost is
[39:43] and and The Sibling one of his siblings
[39:47] said stop no there's no such thing as
[39:52] ghosts and I said now wait wait wait
[39:54] wait wait we don't want to teach our
[39:57] kids
[39:59] that I mean every time we go to church
[40:02] we're talking about the Holy Ghost in
[40:05] Fire
[40:06] and you know I mean it's all about the
[40:09] Holy
[40:10] Ghost so we believe in
[40:14] ghost why why would we tell them there's
[40:16] no such thing as
[40:18] ghosts well there's no such thing as bad
[40:20] ghost
[40:22] is
[40:25] well
[40:29] how do we want to go into that
[40:30] discussion
[40:35] exactly but when we talk about these
[40:37] building blocks of the believer we want
[40:39] to talk about the blocks of faith and
[40:41] love and joy we want to talk about those
[40:43] blocks but the blocks of the believer
[40:46] are not always those lovely joyous
[40:55] blocks
[40:58] and we do our children I think a
[41:02] disservice I got to be careful but I
[41:04] don't mean that we just like oh let me
[41:07] show you what my burden is child you
[41:09] know so you can learn to carry this
[41:11] weight of
[41:12] adulthood just crush your child in one
[41:18] sitting
[41:20] but as
[41:23] Believers when we're sitting in devotion
[41:26] Even in our homes and when we're
[41:29] listening to those tapes and we're you
[41:34] hear if you're just fast forwarding all
[41:36] the way to the prayer lines in the end
[41:39] you're going to hear about Terrible
[41:43] Things Cancers and sicknesses and
[41:47] blindnesses and
[41:49] crippling things that you think what
[41:53] suffering and if we go well I you don't
[41:56] need to know about the
[41:58] suffering no you need to know about the
[42:02] suffering so that you can hear about the
[42:06] Deliverance of the
[42:08] suffering that's why we love that that
[42:11] kept the prayer line part not just the
[42:14] services we love to hear the prayer
[42:15] lines because you get to hear how the
[42:18] while the preaching of the word was
[42:20] going on men and women were who maybe
[42:24] had never picked a Bible up in their
[42:27] lifetime who maybe were just wheeled in
[42:30] from the hospital by a loved one but
[42:32] they're still they don't they're not
[42:35] believers they don't go to the brandom
[42:37] Tabernacle in
[42:39] 1954 these are people that are coming
[42:41] straight from the hospital room from CS
[42:44] and stretchers and people are bringing
[42:46] them in and they you don't know what
[42:48] their life is like they could be
[42:50] alcoholics they could be uh uh uh chain
[42:53] smokers and and and their lives may be
[42:57] absolutely upside down but they are are
[43:00] are coming into this place because
[43:02] somebody has heard that Jesus Christ is
[43:06] the same today that he was when he
[43:09] walked the shores of Galilee and they
[43:11] say is that true well let's go and see
[43:14] right that's the come and see and so
[43:16] they're showing up at the services and
[43:18] brother brandom is saying now we're
[43:20] going to go to the Bible and if the
[43:23] Bible is true then and the Bible if the
[43:27] Bible was true then and the Bible is
[43:29] true now and if God was a Healer then
[43:32] then God must be a Healer now and the
[43:36] people are saying is that true well keep
[43:39] listening and he begins to talk about
[43:41] the word of God and people are hearing
[43:43] it and they're doing like you're doing
[43:45] they're nodding their heads going that
[43:47] he's that's just right off the pages
[43:49] that's that's that's true and he says
[43:52] now if God is true and if this is true
[43:56] then let God back up
[43:58] this and then people begin and and he
[44:01] begins with the gift in his life begins
[44:04] Discerning what is wrong with them he
[44:06] begins Discerning what their doctor
[44:08] looks like he begins Discerning how many
[44:10] surgeries they've had he begins
[44:12] Discerning they're not even there for
[44:13] them but for their neighbor or for their
[44:15] daughter or for somebody that isn't even
[44:17] here but he begins Discerning this
[44:19] through a gift and the people say that
[44:22] is
[44:23] true do you know anything about the
[44:25] Bible not just what I just heard only
[44:28] until now is the only time I've ever
[44:30] heard that do you think it's
[44:32] true
[44:34] yeah well then what can God do with
[44:44] that and we hear it on tape and we
[44:48] go
[44:54] amazing men and women can be
[44:58] delivered from
[45:00] demons plaguing their
[45:04] lives well those are
[45:07] ghosts those are bad
[45:10] ghosts well the bad ghosts don't really
[45:15] exist oh they
[45:22] exist they
[45:24] exist
[45:28] and as
[45:30] Believers if we're hoping to skirt
[45:33] through life without having to ever come
[45:36] up against
[45:38] one where is you're getting your pattern
[45:41] from because in every story I read
[45:45] through here that's the story that comes
[45:48] up is what the
[45:51] believer who maybe was not a Believer at
[45:54] first was up against before he was
[46:00] delivered so we say well then what is
[46:03] what what are the kind of things that we
[46:06] just think that's not real that's not
[46:08] true la la la la la la la that's not
[46:13] real well one of those things are
[46:17] dragons oh what no we're not listening
[46:22] to you talk about Harry Potter this
[46:25] morning
[46:28] I'm not talking about
[46:29] that in Revelations 12: 7-9 it says and
[46:34] there was war in heaven Michael and his
[46:36] angels fought against the
[46:39] dragon there's
[46:41] no and the dragon fought and his angels
[46:45] and prevailed not neither was their
[46:46] place found anymore in heaven and the
[46:48] Great Dragon was cast out that old
[46:51] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[46:55] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[46:56] out into the Earth and his angels were
[46:58] cast out with him I love that John just
[47:01] keeps adding the name so you can't

[47:41] problem so I want to read a children's
[47:43] story for you for you adults to keep
[47:45] this for your children and and we're
[47:47] going to read this children's story
[47:49] children so I hope the children are
[47:51] awake and here we go the name of this
[47:54] story is there's no no such thing as a
[47:59] dragon and it reads like this Billy
[48:01] Bixby was rather surprised when he woke
[48:03] up one morning and found a dragon in his
[48:06] room it was a small Dragon about the
[48:09] size of a
[48:12] kitten the dragon whacked its tail
[48:15] happily when Billy patted its head Billy
[48:18] went downstairs to tell his mother
[48:20] there's no such thing as a dragon said
[48:23] Billy's mother she said it as if she
[48:26] meant
[48:28] it Billy went back to his room and began
[48:31] to dress the dragon came close to Billy
[48:33] and wagged its tail but Billy didn't Pat
[48:35] it if there's no such thing as something
[48:38] it's silly to Pat it on the
[48:41] head Billy washed his face and hands and
[48:44] went to breakfast the dragon went too it
[48:46] was bigger now almost the size of a
[48:50] dog Billy sat at the table the dragon
[48:54] sat down on the
[48:56] table this sort of thing was not usually
[48:59] permitted but there wasn't much Billy's
[49:02] mother could do about it she'd already
[49:03] said there was no such thing as a dragon
[49:06] and if there's no such thing you can't
[49:08] tell it to get off the
[49:12] table mother made some pancakes for
[49:14] Billy but the dragon ate them all
[49:17] up mother made some more but the dragon
[49:20] ate those
[49:21] two mother kept making pancakes until
[49:24] she ran out of B
[49:26] Billy only got one of them but he said
[49:29] that's all he really wanted
[49:32] anyway Billy went upstairs to brush his
[49:34] teeth mother started clearing the table
[49:36] the dragon who was quite as big as
[49:39] Mother by this time made himself
[49:42] comfortable on the hall rug and went to
[49:44] sleep by the time Billy came back
[49:47] downstairs the dragon had grown so much
[49:50] he filled the hall Billy had to go
[49:53] around by way of the living room to get
[49:56] where his mother was I didn't know
[49:58] dragons grew so fast said Billy there's
[50:01] no such thing as a dragon said M said
[50:05] mother
[50:07] firmly cleaning the downstairs took
[50:09] mother all morning what with the dragon
[50:12] in the way and having to climb in and
[50:14] out of Windows to get from room to
[50:19] room by midday the dragon filled the
[50:23] house its head hung out of the front
[50:25] door its tail hung out of the back door
[50:27] and there wasn't room in the house that
[50:30] there wasn't a room in the house that
[50:31] didn't have some part of the Dragon in
[50:36] it when the dragon awoke from his nap he
[50:39] was hungry a bakery van went by the
[50:41] smell of fresh bread was more than the
[50:43] dragon could resist the dragon ran down
[50:46] the street after the Bakery Van the
[50:48] house went too of course like the shell
[50:52] on a
[50:54] snail the postman was just coming up the
[50:57] path with some post for the bixes when
[51:00] their house rushed past him and headed
[51:01] down the street he traced the bixby's
[51:04] house for a few blocks but he couldn't
[51:05] catch it when Mr Bixby came home for
[51:08] lunch the first thing he noticed was
[51:10] that the house was gone luckily one of
[51:13] the neighbors was able to tell him which
[51:15] way it went Mr Bixby got in his car and
[51:19] went looking for his house he studied
[51:21] all the houses as he drove along finally
[51:24] he saw one that looked familiar
[51:25] Billy and Mrs Bixby were waving from an
[51:28] upstairs window Mr Bixby climbed over
[51:31] the dragon's head onto the porch roof
[51:33] and through the upstairs window how did
[51:35] this happen Mr Bixby asked it was the
[51:39] dragon said Billy there's no such thing
[51:42] mother started to say there is a dragon
[51:46] Billy insisted a very big dragon and
[51:51] Billy patted the dragon on the head the
[51:55] Dragon wagged its tail happily then even
[51:57] faster than it had grown the dragon
[51:59] started getting smaller soon it was
[52:01] kitten size again I don't mind dragons
[52:05] this size said mother why did it have to
[52:07] grow so big I'm not sure said Billy but
[52:10] I think it just wanted to be
[52:13] noticed so we like that story huh that's
[52:16] fun the the drawings are so nice
[52:19] and but all of you have already started
[52:23] thinking some of you have already
[52:25] realize what the conclusion of this
[52:32] is if you want to pretend there's no
[52:35] such thing as a
[52:38] dragon as a
[52:45] Believer we'll pray for
[52:51] you but some of
[52:54] you know that dragons are
[52:59] real some of you
[53:02] know that a dragon can come in your
[53:05] house and start very
[53:09] small seems almost innocent like nothing
[53:13] just something new maybe maybe something
[53:16] novel we'll try it out huh we'll see how
[53:21] it goes if we don't like it it can go
[53:29] but sometimes it just goes in your hall
[53:31] and falls
[53:32] asleep and you find yourself without
[53:35] even realizing that you're having to go
[53:37] around it every day you're just going
[53:40] around it you don't it's like it's like
[53:42] it's not a problem you have plenty of
[53:44] Hall space you could go around
[53:51] it but other people notice it's in your
[53:54] house
[54:00] like what's with the dragon you're like
[54:01] what we don't know what dragon you we
[54:03] don't even we don't talk about dragons
[54:06] here we don't even talk about that in
[54:08] our house so silly good well what about
[54:12] the
[54:14] ghosts we don't even believe in ghosts
[54:17] well I hope you
[54:18] do I hope there's
[54:21] one that you fill this house with you
[54:24] know
[54:27] but this
[54:28] dragon that starts so small begins to
[54:31] grow in your homes begins to grow in our
[54:34] homes and then we have it gets to the
[54:38] place to where it will fill every room
[54:42] in your
[54:44] house that there won't be a room where
[54:46] there isn't a piece of dragon hanging
[54:48] around in that
[54:52] room
[54:53] and husband usbands and
[54:57] wives find themselves
[55:01] like on edge your eyes are big and a
[55:05] little bit
[55:07] Twitchy and it's like well what's the
[55:09] problem well I don't know what it is I

[59:16] throwing the mail in your like I got to
[59:17] get out of
[59:20] here
[59:21] right I mean that's a dragon in the
[59:24] house now obviously the end of this
[59:26] story is Billy's patting the dragon's
[59:29] head and we're not looking to Pat no
[59:31] dragons on the head but this idea of we
[59:35] don't we just there is no dragon that is
[59:39] not that is not part of our
[59:43] makeup that is not part of our story if
[59:47] you want to go read the end of the book
[59:49] it is not that you just avoided the
[59:53] dragon it's that you you're an
[59:55] overcomer of that that that this thing
[59:59] with the building blocks of the believer
[1:00:02] is that God is putting something in
[1:00:06] you to withstand
[1:00:09] that that it's not patting it on the
[1:00:12] head but it's dealing with that Dragon
[1:00:15] right away it's stomping that dragon out
[1:00:17] it's the story where brother brandom had
[1:00:19] that dream and or or that man had that
[1:00:21] dream and told brother brandom that I
[1:00:23] had this dream and there was the devil
[1:00:24] and he was so big and I couldn't I felt
[1:00:27] like I couldn't deal with him and he
[1:00:29] every time he came he would he would go
[1:00:31] boo and I would I would shrink and he
[1:00:33] got bigger and the devil got bigger and
[1:00:35] I got smaller and every time he would
[1:00:37] scare me like that I got smaller and he
[1:00:39] got bigger until my faith something
[1:00:42] within me started saying boo back then
[1:00:46] he got smaller and I got
[1:00:49] bigger it's the same thing and brother
[1:00:51] tells a story about that dream that of
[1:00:54] uh of where he thought it was his father
[1:00:56] and his mother and and there was a man
[1:00:58] that was beating her with a club over
[1:01:00] the head and he said he was so big he
[1:01:02] was so strong I could not go up against
[1:01:05] that man he said but then my faith
[1:01:07] muscles rose up with inside of me and I
[1:01:10] said you hit her one more time you'll
[1:01:13] have to deal with
[1:01:17] me now brother explains to us that that
[1:01:19] was that ecclesiastical teaching that
[1:01:22] trinitarian teaching trying to beat that
[1:01:25] trinitarian teaching into the churches
[1:01:27] but how many other things try to get
[1:01:30] beaten into you I'm telling you that
[1:01:32] dragon is real and he's got these
[1:01:34] fingers and he just wants to creep in
[1:01:37] and creep in and creep in until he's got
[1:01:40] those fingers around your neck and he's
[1:01:43] ringing the life out of your house out
[1:01:46] of your church out of your car rides out
[1:01:49] of everything he wants to ring the life
[1:01:51] right out of
[1:01:53] it
[1:02:11] you know those
[1:02:13] stories when young guys get
[1:02:17] together did you see that guy did you
[1:02:19] hear what he said oh man if I would have
[1:02:22] been
[1:02:23] there
[1:02:26] I would have said and they list off this
[1:02:29] really powerful
[1:02:31] speech that's
[1:02:33] what then you know somebody I was in
[1:02:36] this place and this brother or this man
[1:02:38] or this woman they were talking about
[1:02:39] somebody else and I was
[1:02:43] like and I and you're like
[1:02:47] wow you go you said that
[1:02:51] no but I was thinking it
[1:02:58] everybody been there all right I'm so
[1:03:03] glad that we have recorded and
[1:03:07] written that there is a spirit that
[1:03:09] would love to beat you over the head
[1:03:11] with a club Corner Three Corner club or
[1:03:15] whatever else what other kind of abuse
[1:03:17] that the devil would like to put on you
[1:03:19] whether that be physical sickness or or
[1:03:23] or some sort of a teaching to throw you
[1:03:25] out into some fanaticism or whatever
[1:03:28] else and keep you away from the building
[1:03:31] blocks of the word and of Christ and of
[1:03:35] you know faith and love whatever it
[1:03:37] would be oh it' be in the name it's it's
[1:03:39] surely it'll be in the Name of Love
[1:03:41] it'll be in the name of Faith but it's
[1:03:44] not it is it is absolutely the devil and
[1:03:48] you know it as a Believer you and
[1:03:51] somebody was go prove it you go I just
[1:03:53] know it there's an unction that God has
[1:03:56] put within your heart that you just
[1:03:58] there's something in you and you just
[1:04:00] think well was it clean was it lovely
[1:04:04] was it
[1:04:05] honest and maybe that's what it you you
[1:04:08] you know you can't find you know where
[1:04:11] in 2 Chronicles where to rebut that
[1:04:14] thing but you know as a Believer because
[1:04:17] God has put some blocks within you that
[1:04:20] are
[1:04:21] firm that are big based blocks
[1:04:27] and I'm so glad that we have something
[1:04:29] that is written that if you try to pull
[1:04:32] this you'll deal with me and we can go
[1:04:35] back to the word we can go back to those
[1:04:38] tapes we can gather around the pure word
[1:04:41] of God and we can say you know this is
[1:04:44] what I'm experiencing in my
[1:04:47] life and we pour ourselves out before
[1:04:50] one another knowing that we care for one
[1:04:53] another
[1:04:55] knowing I know you've been where I've
[1:05:00] been I remember praying for you going
[1:05:04] through certain struggle so I know you
[1:05:07] know what I'm dealing with and let me
[1:05:08] tell you what I'm dealing
[1:05:18] with we don't have to
[1:05:21] cower to a dragon now you know this idea
[1:05:24] of if I would have been
[1:05:27] there let's there's been plenty of
[1:05:31] opportunity
[1:05:33] where a situation presents itself and
[1:05:37] you would think you know I'm going to
[1:05:40] run in there and deal with the situation
[1:05:41] and instead you're just Frozen you don't
[1:05:44] even know what to
[1:05:47] do and when the whole thing is said and
[1:05:49] done you thought I thought that I would
[1:05:51] have I thought I was the kind of guy
[1:05:53] that that would run in and attack that
[1:05:56] thing and you find out you're not that
[1:05:58] kind of
[1:06:00] guy I froze up I didn't know what to do
[1:06:03] in that
[1:06:05] situation and that's being
[1:06:10] real but when we have got a
[1:06:13] word that we can go back
[1:06:20] to when we can just the quotes that I
[1:06:24] read about sacrifice and patience and
[1:06:28] all these things and you can read that
[1:06:31] you can read your Bible and you can read
[1:06:33] what these men and what these women did
[1:06:35] and how they how they
[1:06:38] walked amidst those
[1:06:42] trials say God I don't know if I'm a
[1:06:45] Moses I don't know if I'm a Jeremiah I
[1:06:48] don't know if I'm a Amos or a micaah I
[1:06:51] don't know if I'm that but I believe
[1:06:54] like they
[1:06:55] believed and Lord as you're building
[1:07:04] me you know
[1:07:06] maybe maybe we think maybe maybe brother
[1:07:10] Reggie thinks I'd like an extra big
[1:07:14] block of
[1:07:16] faith God
[1:07:18] says no what I've given you is
[1:07:22] sufficient
[1:07:25] but if I had Faith I'd be able to run in
[1:07:27] and just deal with the situation he says
[1:07:29] yeah but you might be overzealous and
[1:07:31] you may go overcorrect that thing you
[1:07:34] may deal harshly you don't need that
[1:07:38] what you need is more love you think man
[1:07:45] really yeah you need some more of that
[1:07:48] and I have seen over the last few years
[1:07:51] even even being here
[1:07:54] even being amongst you
[1:07:56] all I've seen God do things in my life I
[1:07:59] was telling brother Phillip last night
[1:08:02] that two years ago if there was a
[1:08:04] certain situation presented itself I had
[1:08:06] an answer and it was solid I was I knew
[1:08:11] it and today it is absolutely different
[1:08:16] God has turned that thing totally
[1:08:21] around and I look at that and I just um
[1:08:25] Marvel at
[1:08:30] that but I see that everywhere
[1:08:37] here I don't see just that here I see
[1:08:41] that over in
[1:08:43] Bulgaria you know I I see that I see
[1:08:46] that all over the place it's it's being
[1:08:49] a Believer and it's those building
[1:08:52] blocks that God puts in your life and he
[1:08:55] places them in a way and in a place that
[1:08:59] you thought for sure that does not go
[1:09:02] there but when it's done
[1:09:05] wow it's
[1:09:10] perfect I'm closing with this in Acts 7:
[1:09:16] 47-49 says but Solomon built him in
[1:09:20] house how be it the most high dwelleth
[1:09:21] not in temples made with hands as sayth
[1:09:24] the prophet Heaven is my throne and
[1:09:26] Earth is my foot stol what house will ye
[1:09:29] build me sayeth the Lord or what is the
[1:09:31] place of my rest in the message what
[1:09:35] house will ye build me preached down in
[1:09:38] Tucson brother
[1:09:40] brandom and I realize he's talking about
[1:09:43] brother green brother
[1:09:46] Perry but just fit yourself in
[1:09:50] this says but we as this group of people
[1:09:53] we have a message for this day we
[1:09:56] believe that God has given us a message
[1:09:59] I think that's very gracious that
[1:10:01] brother brandham has included Us in
[1:10:04] this brother green is I don't want to
[1:10:07] call him my associate because we're well
[1:10:09] it is also my associate we're together
[1:10:12] in this
[1:10:13] message brother green preaches the same
[1:10:16] thing and message that I believe in he's
[1:10:18] left his home he's left his people he's
[1:10:21] left his church he was I believe he was
[1:10:24] a district superintendent or something
[1:10:26] of one of the organizations and give the
[1:10:27] whole thing up when he heard
[1:10:32] this he left everything that was dear to
[1:10:35] him also to come to the desert just to
[1:10:37] support what
[1:10:39] God is giving to us
[1:10:43] now I say I believe it's not only should
[1:10:46] be in our
[1:10:47] heart it should be in our duty to back
[1:10:50] him up everything that we can to attend
[1:10:52] the services to come here to worship and
[1:10:55] to make this a place where God can
[1:10:58] reveal to us the things that he's for us
[1:11:01] to
[1:11:07] reveal I say
[1:11:11] amen and as his word said the message
[1:11:15] doesn't come to me through the giving of
[1:11:18] the inspiration as it does maybe to some
[1:11:19] of us but he said I'm here to back up
[1:11:23] what God has
[1:11:25] given what a
[1:11:27] statement so what brother green is
[1:11:30] saying is God doesn't give me messages
[1:11:32] like he gives to brother
[1:11:35] brandham but I want to support with the
[1:11:38] way God made me as a Believer I want to
[1:11:41] be a support to the rest of this
[1:11:44] structure am called the body of
[1:11:48] Christ I want to be a
[1:11:51] pillar I want to be a corner I I want to
[1:11:54] be Crown molder I don't know what I
[1:11:56] don't know where you have need of me I
[1:11:57] don't know what piece where I fit into
[1:12:00] this whole thing but I want to be part
[1:12:02] of it so whatever God has made me the
[1:12:06] way he shaped me I'm sorry it's as
[1:12:09] Quirky as it is I'm sorry that it looks
[1:12:11] like it does
[1:12:13] but God I promise God's in
[1:12:21] it and I'm a part of
[1:12:25] this some of you go but you don't even
[1:12:27] you're kind of you you're funny looking
[1:12:31] in this like we're all normal stones and
[1:12:35] you're not I know but I I don't know
[1:12:37] what this thing's going to look like in
[1:12:38] the end y'all
[1:12:42] but you know maybe I'll be covered up
[1:12:44] with something else so you won't see
[1:12:45] this Stone you know I don't
[1:12:49] know I want to be part of
[1:12:52] it
[1:12:54] I'm in the body of Christ
[1:13:00] yeah and I believe if we will all
[1:13:02] cooperate together we'll put our hearts
[1:13:04] to it I know now listen to this I know
[1:13:10] that each one of you if you feel like I

[1:14:37] it some experiences I just had up in the
[1:14:40] mountain just to feel that once again
[1:14:43] that something that when I was first
[1:14:45] Saved was So Glorious to my heart and we
[1:14:48] can come into a place we can sit and we
[1:14:51] can see it among us that we're
[1:14:54] that we're drying as we sit here in the
[1:14:56] desert I get among my brethren they talk
[1:14:58] with me and I talk with them always in a
[1:15:00] little way of watching feeling out there
[1:15:03] with the spirit as it was to see just
[1:15:05] the condition of that brother to see
[1:15:07] what's wrong I begin to feel us all
[1:15:10] reclining getting away from the spirit
[1:15:12] it's become too natural a thing to us we
[1:15:15] must Worship in the spirit the the uh
[1:15:19] where the spirit of God not only our
[1:15:22] message should be the flame of the hour
[1:15:24] it should be the flame in our
[1:15:26] hearts see it's got to be in our hearts
[1:15:30] or we can't we can't rightly present it
[1:15:33] to the people the spirit has to pack the
[1:15:36] message itself yes
