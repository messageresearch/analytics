[0:00] amen first john chapter two are we gonna
[0:02] read verses one to six again
[0:05] first john chapter two verses one to six
[0:08] we'll mention it again at the end we're
[0:10] having a meeting
[0:10] next sunday at 2 30 here um
[0:14] that's a church meeting for the members
[0:15] of the church we'd like to have a
[0:16] meeting for everyone
[0:18] uh we could maybe call it a business
[0:19] meeting a church meeting at 2 30
[0:21] next sunday here at the church first
[0:23] john
[0:25] chapter 2 verse 1 my little children
[0:27] these things write i
[0:28] unto you that ye sin not and if any man
[0:31] sin
[0:32] we have an advocate with the father
[0:34] jesus christ the righteous that's what
[0:36] we're focusing on
[0:38] is that phrase we have an advocate with
[0:40] the father
[0:41] and it it expounds upon this advocate
[0:45] and he is the perpetuation for our sins
[0:48] and not for ours only but also for the
[0:50] sins of the whole world
[0:51] and hereby we do know that we know him
[0:53] if we keep his commandments
[0:55] he that saith i know him and keepeth not
[0:56] his commandments as a liar
[0:58] and the truth is not in him but who so
[1:01] keepeth his word and him verily is the
[1:02] love of god perfected
[1:04] hereby know we that we are in him he
[1:07] that saith he abideth in him ought
[1:09] himself
[1:09] also so to walk even as he walked
[1:13] and we saw the symmetry with john
[1:14] chapter 14 and 15 and 16 last time on
[1:17] those commandments
[1:19] and the comforter and the holy ghost if
[1:21] we could bow our heads in a word of
[1:22] prayer
[1:23] a gracious heavenly fathers we stand in
[1:25] your divine presence today
[1:26] we're requesting your assistance lord we
[1:29] desire your help
[1:31] as speaker and listener lord we realize
[1:34] that unless you would come
[1:35] and do the part of the here to open up
[1:39] our hearts and to quicken things to us
[1:42] then the part of the speaker is is in
[1:44] vain
[1:45] and lord if you would not come and
[1:46] anoint the speaker's lips and to
[1:49] move him out of the way and take that
[1:51] word and minister to our hearts then
[1:53] again lord it would be in vain but with
[1:55] your presence here with us
[1:57] working on both ends we believe that you
[1:59] can speak to us in a very profound and
[2:00] practical way
[2:02] today lord our hearts are mindful of the
[2:05] many that we know that are sick
[2:07] lord that are fighting sickness and
[2:08] affliction lord we think of sister karen
[2:11] propolis
[2:12] heard a positive report lord of how
[2:14] you're touching her we pray that you
[2:15] completely deliver her
[2:17] lord for sister karen pruitt may she be
[2:19] revived lord may she come out of
[2:21] this sleeping lord and this brain bleed
[2:23] may be gone may
[2:24] any negative damage or any damage that
[2:28] they believe has transpired lord may it
[2:29] be completely reversed may she be made
[2:31] well
[2:32] lord for brother tom earnest i ask that
[2:34] you'd heal him raise him up
[2:36] lord he's expressed a tremendous amount
[2:37] of support
[2:39] for the cause of christ lord in years of
[2:41] labor and
[2:43] and ministry we pray that you touch him
[2:44] and heal him comfort his family
[2:46] lord for those that are hurting that are
[2:48] sick that are not well lord those that
[2:50] are absent from us we pray that you'd
[2:52] help them
[2:53] strengthen them and encourage them
[2:54] father bless brother gene today on his
[2:56] birthday may you give him strength
[2:58] bless him and give him his heart's
[2:59] desires lord this service today is yours
[3:03] use it for our benefit father and for
[3:05] your glory we ask this in the name lord
[3:07] jesus christ
[3:08] amen it could be seated
[3:13] i'm just going to jump right into the
[3:15] subject of the bride's advocate again
[3:17] and i feel that though there's going to
[3:19] be maybe some
[3:21] backtracking and a little bit of
[3:22] reviewing that it really is a
[3:24] subject that doesn't need much uh much
[3:27] foundation or background you'll just be
[3:29] able to enter right into it
[3:31] but when we looked at last time we have
[3:34] an advocate which we're taking from
[3:36] first john chapter two verse one
[3:39] that advocate is the same word that's
[3:41] used for
[3:42] comforter and it's john he's the only
[3:44] writer in the new testament that uses
[3:45] the word the comforter or the advocate
[3:48] they're one the same
[3:49] so the advocate is the comforter our
[3:51] advocate is the holy ghost
[3:53] and we identified in scripture is how
[3:56] that this advocate of this comforter is
[3:58] an inside teacher we talk about the
[4:00] teacher the inside teacher the inner
[4:03] inner witness as we looked at it and so
[4:05] it's a it's something that in dwell
[4:07] dwells within the believer and from the
[4:09] inside
[4:10] it testifies to us from the inside it
[4:12] encourages us from the inside it
[4:14] supports us
[4:15] so it's not a comforter that's kind of
[4:17] on the outside you know kind of cheering
[4:19] us on
[4:20] uh telling us what to do externally but
[4:22] it's something that dwells on the inside
[4:24] and encourages us in john chapter 14
[4:27] verses 16 and 17
[4:30] jesus says and i will pray the father
[4:32] and he shall give you
[4:33] another comforter that he may abide with
[4:36] you forever
[4:37] again we can see the example of advocacy
[4:39] jesus knowing that he's going to be gone
[4:41] prays for his disciples and he's telling
[4:43] them that i'm with you as your teacher
[4:45] as your master is your guide
[4:47] you're hearing me teach things and
[4:49] you're hearing me say things and i'm
[4:51] telling you where to go and what to do
[4:53] but when i'm gone i'm going to pray the
[4:54] father and he's going to send you the
[4:56] comforter
[4:57] and he will abide with you and we know
[4:59] not just with but in them
[5:01] forever and he says even the spirit of
[5:04] truth so our advocate is
[5:05] the comforter it is the holy spirit it
[5:08] is the spirit of truth
[5:10] and then it he makes this statement whom
[5:12] the world cannot receive
[5:14] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[5:17] him
[5:18] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[5:20] and shall
[5:21] be in you and this places the
[5:24] the function of the holy spirit or this
[5:26] role of the advocate
[5:28] this role of the comforter he's saying
[5:30] that only the born-again
[5:32] have this advocate only the born-again
[5:35] have it and and maybe the the lack of a
[5:37] robust
[5:38] amen is sympathy uh for the world that
[5:40] doesn't have it
[5:41] but only the elect have the this
[5:43] comforter only the elect had this
[5:45] advocate
[5:46] and and that means that to have it you
[5:48] must be born again
[5:49] so if there's somebody who does not have
[5:51] it the solution is to be born again then
[5:53] you can
[5:53] see the kingdom of heaven and here it
[5:55] says that the world does not know him
[5:57] nor can it receive them
[5:58] because they remain in a sinful state so
[6:01] it is not for the world the world cannot
[6:03] see him the world does not know but you
[6:05] know him
[6:06] for he dwelleth with with you and he
[6:08] shall be in you
[6:10] and this very phrase this uh
[6:13] periclatos in the greek it speaks to be
[6:16] alongside of
[6:17] to be divinely appointed to be summoned
[6:20] to be there so he's divinely appointed
[6:23] to ever remain within the believer if
[6:25] you've been born again you're always
[6:27] born again you can't be unaborn again we
[6:29] we really truly believe
[6:31] that once saved always save in the
[6:33] literal sense if you're saved you can't
[6:34] be unsaved
[6:35] if you're sealed you can't be unsealed
[6:37] and so if you have
[6:38] if you have the advocate if you have the
[6:40] comforter if you have the indwelling of
[6:42] the holy ghost
[6:43] on the soul when you're born again it
[6:45] ever remains there
[6:47] and so the role of an advocate is to be
[6:49] an inner strength
[6:50] the role of the advocate is to be a
[6:52] supporter from the inside
[6:54] to support you to encourage you to lead
[6:56] you and to guide you again he's an
[6:57] inside teacher
[6:59] so this begin to think a little bit more
[7:01] broadly about the holy ghost you've
[7:03] received
[7:04] it's not well i've been born again and
[7:05] now i have the holy ghost and it's some
[7:07] kind of
[7:07] a marker deep down inside your soul that
[7:10] identifies the fact that you're a
[7:12] christian
[7:12] but it's actually a vitality it's a
[7:14] power it's a life
[7:16] that lives on the inside of you to
[7:17] encourage you
[7:19] it lives on the inside of you to support
[7:20] you when you find that nobody else
[7:22] supports you nobody else understands you
[7:24] you can't get answers you're not sure
[7:26] you what to do there's a power on the
[7:28] inside of the believer that they can
[7:30] look to and say
[7:31] you're my advocate you're my supporter
[7:33] you're my leader you're my guide
[7:35] so you're not looking externally you're
[7:37] you're
[7:38] digging deep down within your soul and
[7:40] finding the resource that you need
[7:41] to be led to be encouraged to be
[7:43] supported an advocate in the scripture
[7:45] is one whose pleads on
[7:47] someone else's behalf so the advocate
[7:50] pleads on your behalf
[7:52] it supports your interest it promotes
[7:55] what's best for you
[7:57] so you want to listen to your advocate
[7:59] you don't want to listen to your own
[8:00] thoughts you want to listen to your
[8:01] advocate because he
[8:02] pleads on your behalf he supports your
[8:04] interest he actually promotes what is
[8:06] best for you
[8:07] the holy ghost is going to promote the
[8:09] things that are best for you
[8:12] and we one of the things that really
[8:14] stood out to me personally
[8:16] as i studied this over the last couple
[8:17] weeks is that our advocate
[8:20] is in this role of maintaining this
[8:23] unbroken continuity with god
[8:26] that if we did not have the advocate
[8:28] then we could come we could be in
[8:29] certain situations where we feel his
[8:30] presence
[8:31] and it can fall upon our flesh and we
[8:33] can rejoice and we can dance and we
[8:35] could even
[8:35] speak in tongues or or manifest
[8:37] different gifts and do different things
[8:39] but the advocate the one that dwells on
[8:41] the inside
[8:42] guarantees this unbroken continuity
[8:45] between the believer and god
[8:47] and he's there for that and why is he
[8:50] there because your soul is born again
[8:52] but your spirit and your mind aren't
[8:54] and the flesh wars against the soul
[8:57] and does everything it can to bring
[8:59] darkness and to bring confusion and
[9:00] bring this discontinuity
[9:02] as satan would desire to sift you as
[9:04] wheat but i have prayed for you
[9:06] that your faith fail not so that we
[9:08] could remain in harmony and continuity
[9:11] and in fellowship with the father
[9:14] i'm going to read i'm just going to read
[9:16] a number of different
[9:18] bullet points it's not a it's not a
[9:20] quote just yet
[9:22] but i'm just going to read all these
[9:23] different things that brother branham
[9:24] said the advocate was
[9:26] in the sermon what is the holy ghost and
[9:29] he's talking about the advocate
[9:31] he says it's a seal sign comforter
[9:34] deliver
[9:35] rest peace goodness healing power
[9:38] righteousness resurrection life these
[9:41] are all the things that he says
[9:42] the advocate is he's a seal he's a sign
[9:45] he's a comforter he's a deliverer he
[9:46] gives you rest he's peace he's goodness
[9:48] healing
[9:48] power righteousness resurrection life he
[9:51] said he's the god of heaven
[9:52] so this is something powerful that you
[9:54] have on the inside of you if it's the
[9:56] god of heaven it's not a get out of jail
[9:58] card that you have in your heart
[9:59] that you've got to present to god
[10:01] whenever he wants to throw you in hell
[10:02] that's not it at all it is god himself
[10:05] on the inside of you
[10:06] he says it has mercy it stands in your
[10:08] place it does things you can't do
[10:11] he's on your side he's an advocate he's
[10:14] for you he's not against you he's for
[10:16] you
[10:17] he says it's all that god has for you so
[10:20] if you want all that god has the
[10:22] advocate is there to bring it to you
[10:23] the advocate is there to lead you to
[10:25] receive it the advocate is there
[10:27] to show you how to take possession of it
[10:29] he says it's the assurance that god has
[10:32] received you
[10:33] and so there's there's just another i
[10:36] think that phrase to me is one of the
[10:37] most profound it's the assurance that
[10:39] god
[10:39] has received you when you have the
[10:42] advocate he assures you that you've been
[10:44] received
[10:45] does that mean a lot to you it should
[10:48] because we wrestle in our minds many
[10:50] times well am i accepted and
[10:51] am i worth it am i good enough have i
[10:53] been born again but the advocate is
[10:55] there to assure you that god has
[10:56] received you
[10:57] and he makes the statement it's god's
[10:58] open door to all these things
[11:00] so the advocate is the one that leads
[11:02] you through that door to participate
[11:04] in the healing and the resurrection the
[11:06] righteousness the power the deliverance
[11:08] the rest the peace
[11:09] the goodness all those things the
[11:11] advocate is the one
[11:12] that is going to allow you and teach you
[11:15] and train you and support you
[11:17] and encourage you to present possess
[11:19] everything that you have need of
[11:22] and he makes this statement brother
[11:23] bannon makes a statement in that sermon
[11:24] what is the holy ghost he says
[11:26] we're walking in a dark world full of
[11:28] enemies full of sin
[11:30] full of traps full of everything in
[11:33] acknowledgment that we
[11:35] who are filled with the holy ghost do
[11:36] not immediately we're not immediately
[11:38] translated into a millennium
[11:40] but we exist within a dark world full of
[11:42] enemies full of sin full of traps
[11:46] and god recognizes them to be trapped
[11:47] and the holy spirit wants to train us to
[11:49] recognize the traps
[11:51] because it's not something oh you're a
[11:52] born-again christian you should have
[11:53] known better well maybe technically in
[11:55] one sense
[11:56] but it's not that it's always obvious
[11:58] it's traps it's full of darkness it's
[12:00] full of everything
[12:01] and then he kind of gets into maybe the
[12:03] heart of a person who's
[12:04] fearful and worried he says you say oh
[12:07] i'm afraid to take the christian life
[12:09] i'm afraid to do this
[12:10] i'm afraid i'll do this and so they're
[12:13] afraid to make this commitment because
[12:14] what if i don't live up to the standard
[12:16] or
[12:16] if i do this then this happens and that
[12:18] happens he says don't be afraid
[12:22] he's not even it's not even saying you
[12:24] won't do it he's saying don't be afraid
[12:25] if you do or you don't
[12:27] don't be afraid we have an advocate
[12:30] john is even saying if you if we sin my
[12:32] little children
[12:33] these things i write into you that you
[12:35] sin not and if we sin if we make a
[12:37] mistake we have an
[12:38] advocate with the father jesus christ
[12:40] the righteous he says we have an
[12:42] advocate
[12:42] oh he stands by us he's in us
[12:45] and makes intercessions for us the holy
[12:48] spirit constantly costing
[12:50] constantly making an advocate for us all
[12:53] the time
[12:54] so let's not be afraid don't be afraid
[12:57] of this world which is full of unbelief
[12:58] full of enemies full of sin
[13:00] full of traps we we shouldn't be afraid
[13:02] to live this christian life
[13:04] because you can you can live this
[13:07] christian life you're me
[13:08] you've been made more than a conqueror
[13:10] you are a conqueror you are more than a
[13:13] conqueror you're an overcomer
[13:14] you are the a daughter of god you are a
[13:17] son of god therefore he looks out after
[13:19] you
[13:19] he's going to encourage you he's going
[13:21] to lead you he's going to guide you
[13:23] there should not be fear failure that
[13:25] means if you fail you're not afraid of
[13:27] it
[13:28] sometimes it will fear i have no fear of
[13:30] failure it's not this arrogance that i
[13:31] won't ever make a mistake
[13:32] i will not let my mistakes testify to me
[13:35] that i'm not his child
[13:36] i recognize lord show me what i did
[13:38] wrong to make the mistakes if i fail
[13:40] this is an opportunity to learn
[13:42] if i fail this is an opportunity for me
[13:43] to repent to really show
[13:46] the zeal to really show my enthusiasm
[13:48] that when i've made a mistake i'm
[13:49] willing to repent
[13:50] and to confess and john teaches us that
[13:52] when we make a mistake
[13:54] if we confess he's just and faithful to
[13:56] forgive us
[13:58] so he says don't be afraid we have an
[13:59] advocate and he says he makes
[14:01] intercessions for us and i really feel
[14:03] that
[14:04] this role of an intercessor is very
[14:07] deep and very in very uh i like to say
[14:10] profound
[14:11] and and i'd like to expound upon it and
[14:13] i've and i'm only going to go so
[14:16] far today and actually just cut my
[14:18] sermon in half
[14:19] and and just realizing i didn't want to
[14:21] go too far and
[14:23] get too lengthy so i try to find just a
[14:25] spot where we could stop and i want to
[14:26] pick up more on these
[14:28] these things next sunday lord willing
[14:31] but let me begin
[14:32] just to take a step further by making a
[14:34] comment again about what we've
[14:35] ministered before the advocate
[14:38] and advocacy is not within the context
[14:40] of an uh
[14:42] where there's it's not in conjunction
[14:44] with an adversary
[14:46] so oftentimes we think of an advocate
[14:49] and i come across this quite a bit when
[14:51] people
[14:51] ask me what kind of law that i do are
[14:53] you a criminal lawyer you're a
[14:55] prosecution or your defense
[14:56] and so they think and though the legal
[14:58] profession is adversarial regardless of
[15:00] what area you're in it's mostly
[15:01] adversarial
[15:02] um there's i mean i'm neither a criminal
[15:05] defense lawyer nor am i
[15:06] a a prosecutor so i'm neither one you're
[15:08] like oh well then you're not really a
[15:09] lawyer well that's what most people
[15:11] think lawyers do
[15:12] is they either represent the guilt or
[15:13] they want to prosecute the guilty
[15:15] there's no innocence no innocent people
[15:17] in the criminal justice system
[15:20] but it's uh and so when we think
[15:21] advocate we think of this legal role or
[15:23] one who's my defense attorney he's there
[15:25] for my defense and an advocate is not
[15:28] adversarial and though we may see that
[15:31] he makes intercessions for us we have an
[15:33] advocate with the father they're
[15:35] together with him
[15:36] he's not in the role of constantly
[15:38] convincing god to forgive
[15:40] our sins that's why i want you to think
[15:43] of this a little bit differently
[15:44] he's not standing there going oh yeah by
[15:46] the way aaron did it again
[15:48] yeah if you could just forgive him for
[15:49] that i know this is getting old
[15:51] but please forgive him that's not the
[15:53] role of the advocate the advocate isn't
[15:54] there constantly
[15:55] trying to cover for you and constantly
[15:57] trying to make a
[15:58] uh you know convince god to forgive you
[16:01] and let you go this time and oh don't
[16:03] hurt him he didn't mean it
[16:04] that's not the role of an advocate and
[16:07] and
[16:07] john even expounds this or wants us to
[16:10] understand
[16:11] from which place this role is birthed
[16:14] and where it comes from by saying that
[16:15] we have an advocate with the father
[16:17] jesus christ the righteous and he says
[16:19] in verse 2
[16:20] and he is the perpetuation for our sins
[16:24] this is an important connection our
[16:26] advocate is identified with jesus christ
[16:28] the righteous
[16:29] and our advocate is one with the
[16:31] atonement
[16:33] so he says and he is the perpetuation
[16:35] for our sins and not for ours only but
[16:37] also for the sins of the world
[16:39] he is saying that jesus christ our
[16:41] advocate
[16:42] he is the atoning sacrifice he is the
[16:46] sacrifice that atoned for our sins
[16:48] and not just the sins of the jews but
[16:51] for the sins of the gentiles
[16:53] and so when he says he is our
[16:54] propitiation christ himself became the
[16:57] sacrifice
[16:57] and that word of perpetuation means he's
[16:59] the appeasement
[17:01] that if there was a requirement he
[17:02] satisfies it satisfied it
[17:04] if there was anger or wrath that you
[17:06] were subject to he appeased it
[17:09] he has settled the matter he is the
[17:10] perpetuation for our sins
[17:12] and so it's very important for us to
[17:14] catch the connection between the
[17:16] advocacy of christ
[17:18] and his role as the atonement so that
[17:20] we're not thinking that we're not always
[17:22] thinking that his role of advocate
[17:24] is always him atoning for something no
[17:27] he was the perpetuation and i'm going to
[17:28] just drive this home for the remainder
[17:30] of this morning
[17:31] he's the perpetuation once for our sins
[17:34] but forever our advocate the
[17:38] perpetuation is for our sins once and
[17:40] for all
[17:41] and so in the bible where this word the
[17:43] perpetuation is used
[17:45] i want to mention the different places
[17:47] it's used in romans chapter 3
[17:50] verses 23 to 26 he says for all have
[17:52] sinned
[17:53] and come short of the glory of god all
[17:55] have done so
[17:57] so when john said in first john chapter
[17:58] 1 if any man says he has not sinned he's
[18:00] a liar why because all men have sinned
[18:03] and is and needs to be born again but
[18:06] then the born again
[18:07] this is the paradox once you're born
[18:08] again you cannot sin because the seed
[18:10] remaineth in you
[18:11] lord you cannot you cannot be
[18:15] subject to permanent judgment anymore
[18:18] so he says for all of sin and come short
[18:20] of the glory of god being justified
[18:22] freely by his grace through the
[18:24] redemption that is in
[18:25] christ jesus and now speaking of christ
[18:28] jesus and those justified freely by his
[18:30] grace
[18:31] through the redemption that is in christ
[18:32] jesus whom jesus christ whom god hath
[18:35] set forth
[18:36] to be a perpetuation through faith in
[18:39] his blood
[18:40] to declare his righteousness for the
[18:42] remission of sins that are passed
[18:44] through the forbearance of god to
[18:47] declare i say at this time
[18:49] his righteousness that he might be just
[18:52] so is jesus christ the righteous he is
[18:54] just
[18:55] and the justifier of him which believeth
[18:58] in jesus
[19:00] and so god himself is just jesus christ
[19:03] himself is justified god is
[19:05] just in justifying you when you believe
[19:09] in jesus christ well how how in the
[19:11] world
[19:11] how in the world can it be that my faith
[19:13] in jesus christ
[19:14] justifies me before god because he set
[19:17] jesus christ forth
[19:18] to be the perpetuation so he has been
[19:21] set forth he has been made a sacrifice
[19:24] that through his blood he can declare
[19:26] you righteous
[19:27] because your sins are forgiven they have
[19:30] been remitted for the
[19:31] remission or forgiveness of sins so
[19:34] through jesus christ
[19:35] there is an appeasing or an atoning or
[19:38] placating is the word could be used
[19:40] in the greek he has placated god's wrath
[19:42] god
[19:43] the law it demands justice and god
[19:46] requires
[19:47] death for sin and where there's sin
[19:49] there must be death
[19:50] and because all were born in sin and all
[19:53] have sinned and come short of the glory
[19:54] of god
[19:55] god's wrath was upon us but then he sets
[19:58] jesus christ
[19:58] forth to appease god's wrath so it
[20:01] removes god's wrath
[20:04] that sacrifice becomes the atonement
[20:07] the word perpetuation that's used in
[20:09] john and also used in romans here
[20:11] is translated in a couple places as
[20:13] mercy seat
[20:15] he set him forth to be the mercy seat
[20:18] and the mercy seat was the cover of the
[20:21] ark of the covenant the lid of the ark
[20:22] of the covenant
[20:23] in the holy of holies and the the image
[20:27] that's being brought up into this new
[20:28] testament how he sent him forth to be
[20:30] the mercy seat
[20:31] he sent him forth to be the perpetuation
[20:34] the mercy seat was sprinkled with the
[20:35] blood of the sacrifice
[20:37] on the day of atonement so on one day
[20:40] and one day a year on the day of
[20:41] atonement the high priest would take the
[20:42] blood of this sacrifice
[20:44] and go into the holy of holies and he
[20:46] would take the blood of the sacrifice or
[20:47] the atonement
[20:48] and he would sprinkle it upon the lid or
[20:50] the cover of the ark of the covenant
[20:52] and in doing so it symbolized something
[20:55] that the sacrifice the life that was
[20:58] lost by the sacrifice
[20:59] that's represented by this blood this
[21:01] unblemished sacrifice this
[21:03] this lamb was the atoner this thing that
[21:05] was offered this beast that was offered
[21:07] was the atonement
[21:08] the sacrifice recognized the life that
[21:11] the people deserve to lose because of
[21:13] their sins
[21:14] so the people deserve to lose their life
[21:16] because of their sins and so instead of
[21:18] them dying they went through this
[21:19] ceremony every year
[21:21] where they took the sacrifice they shed
[21:23] its blood the high priest went in behind
[21:25] the veil into the holy of holies
[21:27] took this blood sprinkled the blood upon
[21:29] the mercy seat
[21:31] and it was this ceremony in doing so
[21:33] that represented that i
[21:35] should have died but the innocent has
[21:37] died in my place
[21:38] and then it would in the in the hearts
[21:40] of the people they would believe
[21:41] their sins for that time had been atoned
[21:43] for
[21:45] and so the the belief in the old
[21:46] testament the teaching in the old
[21:47] testament is by this offering god's
[21:49] judgment was appeased
[21:50] and their sins were atoned for and but
[21:53] they had to come back a year later and
[21:54] do it again
[21:56] now what the bible teaches us and this
[21:57] is what we'll highlight now for a little
[21:59] bit
[21:59] is that for the elect christ did this
[22:03] so in the old testament the mercy seat
[22:05] was a literal seat with behind a
[22:07] covering
[22:07] of the ark of the covenant behind the
[22:09] behind the veil and the holy of holies
[22:11] and the priest would go and he would
[22:13] shed the blood of a sacrifice take the
[22:14] blood go in behind the veil
[22:16] into the holy voice sprinkle blood upon
[22:18] the the
[22:19] the cover the lid of the ark of the
[22:21] covenant that would be called the mercy
[22:23] seat
[22:23] and that would stand for the
[22:24] perpetuation this is in our place
[22:27] this is where we ought to have been
[22:28] judged and we ought to have lost our
[22:30] lives
[22:30] and they would literally do that year
[22:32] after year after year but christ
[22:34] does it one time and that's one
[22:37] part of the symbolism and what i've been
[22:38] um studying on the way the lord has kind
[22:40] of been inspiring me
[22:42] is to look at this is looking at this
[22:45] mercy seat
[22:46] looking at propitiation and how it
[22:48] relates to the bride's advocacy
[22:50] and how it even relates to our advocate
[22:52] how we can have access to such a
[22:53] powerful advocate
[22:54] but when jesus christ is on the cross
[22:57] what is
[22:58] what what transpires this great shaking
[23:00] in this earthquake that takes place
[23:02] it rents the veil of the temple and what
[23:04] does it expose
[23:05] there's no blood on the ark of the
[23:07] covenant that's not the mercy seat
[23:10] the mercy seat had changed it had been
[23:13] as one time it was on wheels and it was
[23:14] in motion once again it was now in
[23:16] motion
[23:17] because now the mercy seat is hanging
[23:18] upon the cross and all the elements that
[23:21] were there
[23:22] in the original mercy seat behind that
[23:24] veil all those same elements now exist
[23:26] upon the cross with the deity and the
[23:28] blood and it's lifted up before the
[23:30] people
[23:30] and now you had to look to that
[23:33] sacrifice
[23:34] for your atonement because there was no
[23:36] more blood in there for
[23:37] in their sacrifice there was no more
[23:39] blood upon that altar
[23:42] and so christ represents this for us in
[23:45] first john chapter 4 verse 10
[23:47] herein is love not that we loved god but
[23:50] that he loved us
[23:52] and in loving us sent his son to be the
[23:55] perpetuation for our sins
[23:57] remember how we identified very early on
[24:00] last sunday
[24:01] he says if you love me you keep my
[24:03] commandments
[24:04] and now that if you really ponder what
[24:06] he's saying if you love him you want to
[24:08] keep his commandments
[24:10] this is the love of god that we keep his
[24:11] commandments and his commandments are
[24:13] not grievous that we love him we want to
[24:14] keep his commandments
[24:15] could you say amen to them and he
[24:18] realizes that no matter how much you
[24:19] love him
[24:20] absent a helper you could never do it
[24:23] so it's his way of giving us the peace
[24:26] that we so long for
[24:27] it's his way of assuring us of our
[24:29] acceptance by when we received him by
[24:31] faith
[24:32] he accepted us upon our confession and
[24:35] so he
[24:36] gives us the baptism of our ghost as the
[24:38] seal of our faith as this assurance that
[24:40] we've been received
[24:41] and and we've received uh we've been not
[24:44] only received by him but we're forgiven
[24:46] and then he gives us some a power on the
[24:48] inside to do the things that we would
[24:50] want to do as a christian
[24:53] and so it's not hearing is his love made
[24:56] known not that we loved him and forced
[24:58] his hand
[24:59] but he loved us and he sent a
[25:00] perpetuation he sent an atonement
[25:03] the very word that's used here this
[25:05] perpetuation or mercy seed it's coming
[25:07] from
[25:07] uh to from the root to favor or grace or
[25:10] kindness
[25:11] it is the kindness of god it is the
[25:14] grace and favor of god that is being
[25:16] expressed to us
[25:17] he is a perpetuation he is the
[25:20] perpetuation for our sins
[25:22] this is what john says jesus christ the
[25:24] righteous is
[25:25] not only our atonement but he is our
[25:28] advocate with god
[25:30] now that that that's where even you can
[25:32] begin to understand that when john
[25:33] saw he turned and he was told he was
[25:37] going to see a lion
[25:38] and he turned and he saw a lamb it fits
[25:40] perfectly with
[25:41] his understanding of how her advocate
[25:44] who would you want your advocate to be
[25:45] you'd want to be the lion
[25:47] that's who you'd want your advocate to
[25:48] be but he was also your lamb
[25:51] your atonement
[25:54] jesus christ the righteous he is our
[25:57] perpetuation so the
[25:58] the foundation now of this advocacy is
[26:00] upon this atonement
[26:03] and so and and i want to
[26:06] i just want to remain in that thought on
[26:08] establishing the atonement because once
[26:10] you identify the role of the atonement
[26:13] it makes the role of the advocate
[26:14] permanent
[26:16] he's not advocating for you and then oh
[26:19] wait hold on wait a minute there's
[26:20] another issue we have to deal with
[26:22] there's something else that needs to be
[26:23] done once you identify the fact that he
[26:25] has
[26:25] played he has done the part of your
[26:28] atoner he has
[26:29] atoned for your sins it makes his role
[26:32] of advocate as secure
[26:34] it's permanent it's not something you
[26:37] should always be
[26:38] fearful of and worry some of and and i
[26:40] speak to this because our our life's
[26:42] experiences
[26:43] have put us in this frame of mind many
[26:45] times that we're somehow going to lose
[26:47] the favor of god
[26:48] that he's going to be done with he's
[26:50] going to cast us aside and we're going
[26:51] to develop this huge complex
[26:52] that at any moment god's going to treat
[26:54] us like the people who loved us after
[26:55] the flesh treated us
[26:57] and that has got to be completely done
[26:59] away with
[27:00] we can no longer live under this shadow
[27:02] that god somehow is going to turn around
[27:03] and be angry at us again
[27:05] there's this revelation that even luther
[27:07] himself had and he expressed it so
[27:09] beautifully
[27:10] if my sins are forgiven then smite me he
[27:13] said if truly my sins are forgiven then
[27:15] smite me lord smite me smite me
[27:17] i believe he says it multiple times
[27:18] because he was expressed in the reality
[27:20] that if sins are forgiven
[27:22] then there really is no wrath of god
[27:23] upon me whatever he allows to take place
[27:26] in this life
[27:27] achieves what his vision is and his goal
[27:29] is not he for only for me
[27:30] but for his kingdom so if you've
[27:32] forgiven me of all my sins
[27:34] then my position and your kingdom is
[27:35] secure then use me however you want
[27:39] use me lord however you want because by
[27:41] the atonement
[27:42] your role in my life as advocate is
[27:44] eternal
[27:47] and so i want to continue to examine the
[27:49] atonement
[27:51] the this atonement is being part of what
[27:54] this advocate has done to keep the
[27:55] proper balance
[27:58] though we've alluded to it i'm just
[27:59] going to substantiate it through a
[28:00] number of scriptures but i'd like to
[28:01] just maybe do it through a portion of
[28:03] scripture we read last time
[28:04] hebrews chapter 10 and we start with
[28:08] verse 14
[28:08] i'm going to read to verse 22 but i'm
[28:11] going to interject back and forth
[28:12] through different places as we read
[28:13] through this so if you you've
[28:15] taken notes you can write down hebrews
[28:16] chapter 10 verses 14 to 22.
[28:19] i'm going to read verse 14 then kind of
[28:20] skip around i go to a couple other
[28:23] places in the same chapter
[28:24] but he says for by one offering
[28:27] he have perfected forever them that are
[28:30] sanctified
[28:32] one offering this isn't multiple
[28:34] offerings this is one offering
[28:36] not offered continually and not offered
[28:40] over and over it's by one offering he
[28:42] have perfected forever them that are
[28:44] sanctified
[28:45] he was offered one time for all
[28:48] this is what is being set forth here in
[28:50] the book of hebrews
[28:51] he says in verse 12 of the same chapter
[28:53] but this man after he had effort
[28:55] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[28:58] sat down on the right hand of god so by
[29:01] this sacrifice
[29:02] the sanctified are eternally perfect
[29:06] not by multiple sacrifices not by
[29:09] multiple offerings of the same one by
[29:10] one offering the the sanctified are
[29:13] forever perfect
[29:14] by this man he has offered he had
[29:16] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[29:19] and verse 10 of hebrews 10 by the which
[29:22] we are sanctified through
[29:24] the offering of the body of jesus christ
[29:27] once for all
[29:28] so notice this repetitive theme just
[29:30] within these first few verses
[29:32] but we are sanctified through the
[29:33] offering of the body of jesus christ
[29:35] once for all
[29:36] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[29:38] forever so by one offering have
[29:40] perfected forever
[29:41] them that are sanctified so the
[29:43] atonement your atonement for all your
[29:45] sins past present and future the
[29:46] atonement was secured
[29:48] through one offering in the old
[29:50] testament it was something that was done
[29:52] on the day of atonement it was something
[29:53] that was done over and over and over
[29:55] again
[29:55] but now there has been one offering
[29:57] offered through jesus christ
[29:59] and in that offering it is permanent
[30:02] it is certain it's not temporal the rain
[30:05] can't wash it away
[30:06] time can't diminish it your decades in
[30:10] sin do not diminish the power of it
[30:12] it is it is ever powerful and so he's
[30:15] saying this one offering perfects
[30:17] forever them that are sanctified and he
[30:19] says it's
[30:20] offered once offered once for all
[30:25] so for by one offering have perfected
[30:26] forever them that are sanctified verse
[30:28] 15
[30:29] whereof the holy ghost also is a witness
[30:32] to us
[30:33] for after that he had said before
[30:36] now this is almost this is almost in the
[30:39] same parallel the same line
[30:42] that john says my little children if any
[30:44] man sin we have an advocate with the
[30:46] father jesus christ the righteous
[30:48] and he is a perpetuation for our sins
[30:51] john is saying he's our advocate he's
[30:54] our advocate because he was our
[30:55] perpetuation
[30:57] now in hebrews notice he's saying he's a
[30:59] perpetuation he was once offered for all
[31:01] of us
[31:02] he was once offered for all of us
[31:03] therefore and because he was offered
[31:06] once for all
[31:07] the holy ghost also is a witness to us
[31:10] if i could say this in one sense and
[31:14] and on one hand maybe it sounds a little
[31:16] odd to say it
[31:17] but then the more you think about it
[31:18] maybe it seems more obvious
[31:20] but he could die for our sins and he
[31:23] could do it in such a way to where
[31:24] it's paid for but what full benefit
[31:28] would we receive if we ever knew it
[31:29] never knew about it like if we just kind
[31:33] of took the attitude hey
[31:34] listen guys he died for the elect the
[31:36] elect are fine
[31:38] let's just all go go enjoy life i think
[31:40] why do we need to show up here
[31:42] twice a week we could be doing so many
[31:44] other things even better things in our
[31:45] community and all the money we
[31:46] we give to the support of the kingdom of
[31:48] god and everything we that we could use
[31:50] this differently why they're relaxed
[31:51] they're covered by the blood anyways
[31:53] and if we just kind of had that attitude
[31:56] i mean maybe technically in some way we
[31:57] could convince ourselves that okay yeah
[31:59] truly surely if the blood was shed
[32:00] then it covers them but that was that's
[32:03] not god's program
[32:05] he said well that's not enough i didn't
[32:07] that's not what i did this for
[32:09] this isn't why i died that is somehow
[32:11] behind closed doors it was secret
[32:13] it's been atoned for and you can just go
[32:14] live your life however you want
[32:16] he says because of that the holy ghost
[32:18] is a witness to us
[32:20] now this is for us who've received it
[32:25] and maybe he's pulling back the curtain
[32:27] a little bit on what's
[32:28] been burning my heart in terms of the
[32:29] bride's advocacy
[32:31] but he says the holy ghost is a witness
[32:34] to us the advocate then
[32:36] will testify to us he has been offered
[32:39] once for
[32:40] all sin he has offered one sacrifice for
[32:42] sins forever
[32:43] by one offering he's perfected forever
[32:45] them that are sanctified and
[32:46] because of that the holy ghost is a
[32:49] witness to us for after that he had said
[32:51] before
[32:52] the advocate will testify to us cause us
[32:54] to remember
[32:55] to never forget well what is it what is
[32:56] it it's right here in verses 16 and 17.
[33:00] this is what the holy ghost testifies to
[33:02] this is what the advocate raises before
[33:04] us
[33:05] this is the covenant that's a very
[33:07] important word to recognize there
[33:09] this is the covenant that i'll make with
[33:10] them after those days saith the lord
[33:13] i will put my laws into their hearts
[33:16] not upon the tables of stone it's not
[33:17] written upon their their doorposts and
[33:19] put on these eyelets and these things i
[33:21] will put my law under their hearts
[33:22] and in their minds will i write them and
[33:25] their
[33:26] sins and iniquities will i remember no
[33:29] more
[33:30] he's quoting from jeremiah 31 verses 33
[33:33] and 34 he's actually quoting
[33:34] this old testament prophecy this is the
[33:37] covenant that i will make with him this
[33:39] is a new covenant
[33:40] this is a different testament this is a
[33:42] different promise
[33:43] i will not just write laws that they
[33:45] that these external things that i'll
[33:46] have to observe
[33:47] but i'll put my very word into their
[33:50] hearts and in their hearts will i write
[33:52] them
[33:52] and thou give them this grace so that
[33:54] they can be liberated to follow the
[33:56] leadership of that law
[33:57] that is written within their hearts
[33:59] their sins and their iniquities will i
[34:01] remember no more against them
[34:03] so they're not always looking over their
[34:04] shoulder they're not always worried
[34:06] about
[34:06] some comeuppance or getting some karma
[34:09] but they'll be liberated and they will
[34:10] be free
[34:12] he's already established in hebrews
[34:13] chapter 8 verses 10 and 12.
[34:15] if you had time to look at that i'm just
[34:17] going to skip over in hebrews chapter 8
[34:19] verses 10 to 12. he's already quoted
[34:21] this exact phrase
[34:22] here in jeremiah 31 and he repeats it
[34:25] again this is the covenant
[34:27] i'll write it in their hearts and their
[34:29] sins and iniquities while i remember no
[34:31] more
[34:32] this is what the holy ghost wants to
[34:35] testify of
[34:37] the holy ghost also is a witness to us
[34:41] your sins and your iniquities will i
[34:43] remember no more the word is written
[34:45] in your heart the word is there on the
[34:47] inside
[34:48] this is your advocate in second
[34:51] corinthians chapter 3 verse 3 for as
[34:53] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[34:55] the epistle of christ
[34:56] ministered by us written not with ink
[35:00] but with the spirit of the living god
[35:03] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[35:05] tables of the heart
[35:07] the spirit the indwelling spirit is set
[35:10] forth as the spirit of the living god
[35:14] riding upon the fleshly tables of your
[35:16] heart
[35:18] you're not just the the epistle in the
[35:20] the heart of paul
[35:22] but the the epistle the word of god is
[35:25] engraved within your heart
[35:28] it says your sins and iniquities will i
[35:30] remember no more no more against you
[35:32] i will put my laws into your hearts and
[35:34] in their minds will i write them it's
[35:35] the spirit of god
[35:37] imprinted in your soul and
[35:40] and the advocates there to remind you of
[35:42] that
[35:43] advocate's there to to to encourage you
[35:46] in that to support you in that
[35:49] this is the covenant that i will make i
[35:52] will not just
[35:52] atone for a sacrifice externally but in
[35:55] this the perpetuation
[35:57] the life of that sacrifice can return
[35:59] back upon the believer
[36:01] to then be a law within their hearts
[36:05] i'll write this word within their heart
[36:09] and witness and testify to them that
[36:10] their sins have been atoned for
[36:14] continuing
[36:18] verse 18 hebrews 10 verse 18 we've read
[36:20] verses 15 16-17 now verse 18.
[36:24] now where remission of these is because
[36:26] remember the perpetuation
[36:28] is set forth to be the remission of sins
[36:30] where the remission of these is
[36:32] there is no more offering for sin now
[36:35] think about that
[36:37] where when sins have been remitted
[36:39] there's no more offering
[36:41] if your sins have been forgiven you
[36:42] don't need another offering for your
[36:44] sins
[36:45] so where sins have been from remitted
[36:47] there is no more offering for sin when
[36:49] sin is forgiven there is no need where
[36:51] it says there is no more often for sin
[36:53] some of the translations say there is no
[36:55] requirement
[36:56] there is no need for another sin
[36:58] offering
[37:00] there is no need for a further atonement
[37:02] that is
[37:03] another sacrifice is not required so as
[37:06] much as we would love to die for the
[37:08] sins of our children or we would love to
[37:09] give our lives
[37:10] uh to atone for someone else's sins it's
[37:12] not required and it wouldn't work
[37:15] because there was one offering for sin
[37:18] and then it says that when sins have
[37:19] been remitted
[37:21] there is no need for another offering
[37:24] so when your sins have been forgiven
[37:26] when you've been identified with that
[37:28] sacrifice
[37:29] then there is no need for another
[37:31] offering
[37:34] when you have been identified with your
[37:36] sacrifice
[37:37] then your sins are forgiven they are
[37:39] remembered no more against you they are
[37:41] gone
[37:41] and having been atoned for jesus christ
[37:44] does not need to walk into the presence
[37:46] of god and go
[37:47] i guess i need to die again and i know
[37:50] sometimes it's used as poetry that
[37:52] whenever we sin it it it it hurts the
[37:55] christ there before the father
[37:56] and whenever we sin there's another
[37:58] affliction in him
[38:00] and he winces in pain and every time we
[38:02] sin he experiences
[38:04] another nail within his flesh and really
[38:06] that's maybe just poetry to make us
[38:08] guilt feel guilty for our sins
[38:10] but there's no reality to that right
[38:13] it's not that he's always up there
[38:15] having to atone for our sins and atone
[38:17] for our sins
[38:18] and i hope that you're staying very very
[38:20] close to what i'm trying to say today
[38:22] because i'm being very faithful to the
[38:23] word of god
[38:24] i want you to recognize that your
[38:26] advocate
[38:27] is connected with the atonement he is a
[38:29] tone
[38:30] for your sins his advocacy isn't
[38:32] constantly apologizing for you
[38:34] constantly trying to cover you up
[38:36] constantly trying to make excuses for
[38:38] you
[38:39] sin is atoned for by for those who have
[38:42] the advocate
[38:44] you've been released from the burden of
[38:46] sin for where remission of sins
[38:49] are there is no more offering of sins
[38:51] his his finished work is by him being
[38:53] the sacrifice by him being set forth to
[38:55] be the perpetuation
[38:56] it has ratified it is confirmed it has
[38:58] validated the new covenant
[39:01] this is the covenant and by the
[39:03] sacrifice of jesus christ he inaugurates
[39:06] the new covenant
[39:10] therefore sin is atoned for and no
[39:12] further offering is needed
[39:15] and the scripture is basically saying
[39:17] whether that where
[39:19] even in light of the old testament
[39:21] sacrifices are no longer needed
[39:24] there does not need to be the continual
[39:25] offense of sacrifices when sins have
[39:27] been annulled
[39:29] this is out this is where we see the
[39:31] transition now
[39:32] that by the offering of jesus christ the
[39:34] high priest doesn't need to go in every
[39:36] year and offer
[39:37] offer a ram he doesn't need to offer a
[39:39] bullock he doesn't need to offer a lamb
[39:40] he doesn't need to offer a bull it's
[39:42] been a tongue for
[39:43] by one offering sins have been atoned
[39:46] for
[39:47] in hebrews chapter 9 verses 25 to 26
[39:51] nor yet that he should offer himself
[39:53] often
[39:54] really the in hebrews the um
[39:59] i i i i i don't know if i'm apologizing
[40:02] now or
[40:03] starting to regret the way i've laid
[40:04] this out but it's really beautiful
[40:07] if you just kind of follow the language
[40:10] and i've kind of moved it around so it
[40:12] seemed to be a little
[40:13] have more continuity with the thought
[40:14] that i'm trying to express here on this
[40:15] one offering forever the atonement's
[40:17] been offered forever
[40:18] and how the advocacy of jesus christ is
[40:21] built upon this fact that he is
[40:23] that we have been accepted through this
[40:24] atonement but paul has taken the
[40:27] template of the old testament and the
[40:28] old priesthood
[40:29] he's been saying oh well they had these
[40:31] priests that were made priests after the
[40:32] law
[40:33] but we have a high priest jesus christ
[40:35] who's after the order of melchizedek not
[40:36] the order of aaron
[40:38] and he's saying we have a high priest we
[40:39] have the sacrifices we have a tabernacle
[40:41] we have a covenant
[40:42] and he compares it to their priesthood
[40:44] their tabernacle their sacrifices
[40:47] their covenant and he's saying this is
[40:49] so much better
[40:50] they had theirs we've got one that's so
[40:52] much better we have a better high priest
[40:54] we have a better promise we have a
[40:55] better sacrifice
[40:56] we have a better tabernacle and and he's
[40:58] laying showing this parallel and
[41:00] expressing these things
[41:01] so in referring to jesus christ who is
[41:03] made a high priest forever after the
[41:05] order melchizedek
[41:06] nor yet that he should offer himself
[41:08] often so we see that the high priest
[41:09] would go in every year and offer
[41:11] sacrifices
[41:12] jesus christ now is a high priest but he
[41:15] doesn't need to constantly go in and
[41:17] offer himself
[41:18] as the high priest entering the holy
[41:20] place every year with the blood of
[41:21] others
[41:22] for then must he often have suffered
[41:24] since the foundation of the world
[41:26] but now once once in the end of the
[41:29] world hath he appeared to put away sin
[41:32] by the sacrifice of himself he only had
[41:35] to do it one time
[41:37] he appeared as the sacrifice once
[41:38] whereas high priest
[41:40] every year had to go behind the holy
[41:41] place with the blood of others he'd take
[41:44] the blood of this
[41:45] sacrifice and sprinkle it upon the lid
[41:47] upon the mercy seat to be a perpetuation
[41:49] and they had to do this every year jesus
[41:51] christ is not a high priest
[41:53] who is also the sacrifice he's the
[41:55] sacrifice he's the high priest and
[41:56] paul's saying
[41:57] this doesn't mean he has to go in every
[41:59] year and sacrifice himself
[42:00] but he appeared once he said in our time
[42:04] to put away sin by the sacrifice of
[42:07] himself he did it once that's the
[42:08] perpetuation
[42:10] and we have an advocate with the father
[42:12] well who is this advocate
[42:14] jesus christ the righteous the righteous
[42:16] sacrifice
[42:17] the atoner the atonement the
[42:19] perpetuation for your sins
[42:21] and that gives me confidence in that
[42:23] lion
[42:26] gives me confidence that he's that it's
[42:29] he's for me
[42:33] he says it's once now back to verse 19.
[42:36] so we've been reading hebrews chapter 10
[42:38] verses 16 17 18 now verse 19 to 22
[42:42] having therefore brethren and
[42:45] let's let's uh pause for a moment just
[42:48] recap it
[42:49] by one offering he's perfected forever
[42:51] them that are sanctified
[42:53] upon that basis we have an advocate now
[42:57] the advocate the holy ghost is a witness
[42:59] an inside witness
[43:00] saying you have the word the word is
[43:02] nine the word is in your heart the word
[43:04] is he's
[43:04] deposited himself in you you have deity
[43:06] when you speak it's deity speaking
[43:09] there's this encouragement nourishment
[43:10] to the soul there's this nourishing of
[43:12] our spirit
[43:13] to strengthen you in the inner man and
[43:16] part of his witnesses and your sins and
[43:18] iniquities
[43:18] he remembers no more against you
[43:21] justified freely by his grace
[43:23] so he's established that he's this
[43:25] witness and then now he's saying
[43:27] this this witness of the holy ghost
[43:30] there's not this repetition of the
[43:31] offering of sacrifices
[43:33] because he's been offered once one time
[43:35] for all that should settle it
[43:36] and so now he says this is what it ought
[43:38] to produce for us this is what it
[43:41] does having therefore brethren boldness
[43:43] in light of this
[43:45] having therefore brethren boldness to
[43:47] enter now this is
[43:48] this gets really rich and and i'm not
[43:51] even going to get into it i'm just gonna
[43:54] just savor it for a moment having
[43:57] therefore brethren boldness to
[43:58] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[44:00] jesus
[44:03] what they had a high priest who had to
[44:06] go in he had to
[44:08] wash himself he had to dress a certain
[44:10] way they put bells on his
[44:12] skirt right just in case they didn't
[44:14] hear him wiggling around in there they'd
[44:16] drag him out they had to tie some to his
[44:17] ankles so nobody else went in there
[44:18] this was a very serious thing you just
[44:20] didn't go behind nobody could not just
[44:22] anybody could go in there
[44:23] a high priest who went through a very
[44:25] meticulous detailed preparation had to
[44:28] go behind there
[44:29] and hope that he was accepted and
[44:30] sprinkled the blood and then everyone no
[44:32] he made it he atoned for us everything's
[44:33] been atoned for
[44:34] and then paul all of a sudden just makes
[44:36] this dramatic shift
[44:37] to where we have one offer and he's been
[44:39] offered forever for us
[44:40] and and how that he doesn't have to go
[44:42] in every year and do it but he did it
[44:43] once for all
[44:44] and now all of a sudden everything
[44:46] changes he says now
[44:48] with this witness of the holy ghost we
[44:50] can have
[44:51] boldness ourselves to do what
[44:54] enter the holiest by the blood of jesus
[44:59] we have or we can enter into there
[45:02] why because he's the door of everything
[45:04] that god has for us
[45:06] how is it that we could enter into the
[45:08] holiest the holy of holies this
[45:09] this secret place by a new and living
[45:12] way
[45:13] this is the new covenant by a living way
[45:14] which he hath consecrated for us
[45:16] through the veil that is to say his
[45:18] flesh his flesh
[45:20] forever consecrated a new and living way
[45:24] and having a high priest over the house
[45:26] of god
[45:28] let us draw near
[45:31] we have a high priest let us draw near
[45:34] with a true heart
[45:35] in full assurance of faith
[45:39] this could be where a lot of us find
[45:41] ourselves many times
[45:42] god's just wanting to establish this
[45:44] true heart in the
[45:46] full assurance of faith this is why the
[45:49] holy ghost is a witness of this covenant
[45:51] that i'll put my law on your hearts and
[45:53] in your minds and your sins and
[45:54] iniquities while i remember no more so
[45:55] that we can have a true heart in full
[45:57] assurance of faith
[45:59] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[46:01] conscience
[46:02] and our bodies washed with pure water
[46:05] now now you have the very image of what
[46:07] the high priest went through
[46:09] and now it's being attributed to us not
[46:11] just jesus christ
[46:12] maybe we could all just accept well
[46:14] jesus christ did that he was the
[46:15] sacrifice but now we're the ones
[46:18] that because of this atonement have this
[46:21] access and the true heart and full
[46:23] assurance of faith having our hearts
[46:24] sprinkle from an evil conscience
[46:26] in our bodies washed with pure water we
[46:28] have the boldness to enter into the
[46:30] holiest
[46:31] through our atonement the blood of the
[46:33] atonement has cleansed us
[46:36] the blood of the atonement has washed us
[46:37] revelations 1 5
[46:39] by his own blood he's washed us by his
[46:42] own blood he's cleansed us and made us
[46:44] what
[46:44] kings and priests so now we have been
[46:48] ceremonially placed in this position of
[46:51] ourselves being kings
[46:53] and ourselves being priests to offer up
[46:55] sacrifices
[46:57] i think it's said many times even in the
[46:59] in the
[47:00] by the the jews and their talmud and in
[47:02] their law
[47:04] that their sacrifices will continue to
[47:06] be offered until the final sacrifice and
[47:08] from then on only the sacrifice of
[47:10] praise is given
[47:12] we've had one sacrifice given and now we
[47:15] offer up to him
[47:16] our bodies as a living sacrifice
[47:21] now that we're washed through the blood
[47:22] of jesus christ we have this access to
[47:25] god
[47:27] this is this is he's made a way he says
[47:30] it's a new and living way we have an
[47:32] advocate with the father
[47:33] so it's connected with the atonement
[47:35] this opens up things to us we realize
[47:37] now that our advocate is not just having
[47:39] to busy himself with trying to
[47:40] all of our mistakes and our doubts and
[47:42] our fears he can busy himself with
[47:44] encouraging us
[47:45] in them he can busy himself with lifting
[47:48] us up above them and teaching us and
[47:50] leading us and guiding us
[47:51] through this world of traps and darkness
[47:53] full of enemies and sin
[47:56] through the atonement we have access to
[47:58] god
[48:00] paul in first corinthians chapter 6
[48:01] verse 11 when he's talking about you
[48:03] know whoremongers and adulterers and
[48:05] everything he says and such were some of
[48:06] you
[48:07] and some of us said amen he said such
[48:10] were some of you he says but you're
[48:12] washed
[48:13] but you're sanctified but ye are
[48:16] justified in the name of the lord jesus
[48:18] and by the spirit of our god if if you
[48:21] could just walk out of here with one
[48:23] assurance today if you are a born-again
[48:25] son or daughter of god let it just ring
[48:27] within your heart
[48:28] you are washed you are sanctified you
[48:31] are
[48:31] justified in the name of the lord jesus
[48:33] and by the spirit of our god
[48:35] don't let any lie any rumor any myth
[48:38] truth any false doctrine
[48:39] put you in this state of purgatory it's
[48:42] nonsense that takes the word of god
[48:44] and establishes a quote unquote message
[48:47] purgatory for
[48:48] the bride there is none
[48:51] you are washed you are forgiven you are
[48:53] justified
[48:55] freely by his grace let us not try to
[48:58] carve out some place where the bride
[49:00] is always just there unsure well what's
[49:02] going to happen maybe i could be fullest
[49:04] virgin
[49:04] just get it out of your head right now
[49:06] if there's any foolishness in you
[49:09] this word will drive it away
[49:12] i commit myself as a man of god we
[49:14] establish this church
[49:16] with the purpose that it'll drive away
[49:18] foolishness through the word of god then
[49:20] it'll wash you
[49:21] cleanse you purify you strengthen you
[49:24] and encourage you
[49:26] none of you will be dangled over hell
[49:27] you'll be encouraged and nourished by
[49:29] the holy
[49:30] ghost
[49:34] you're washed you're sanctified you're
[49:35] justified
[49:37] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[49:39] by the spirit of our god
[49:40] and this is the truth the advocate wants
[49:42] to remind you of
[49:44] the advocate doesn't play mind games
[49:46] with you
[49:47] the advocate's not trying to trick you
[49:49] and using reverse psychology
[49:51] i mean to this day i'll never forget my
[49:53] grandma got me one time
[49:55] and we were we were digging up sand
[49:57] crabs in san diego just by the buckets
[49:59] full we were wanting to keep them for
[50:00] some reason i don't know what we're
[50:01] gonna do with them
[50:03] i don't know if we're gonna have a sand
[50:04] crab boil later or
[50:06] but uh my grandma said boys throw these
[50:12] throw these sand crabs back in the ocean
[50:14] and you know my two younger brothers are
[50:15] the ones you hear all the stories about
[50:17] uh they they refuse they know we're
[50:20] going to keep all these crabs we want to
[50:21] keep these crabs
[50:22] so my grandma turns in and says aaron
[50:25] always listens to what i have to say
[50:27] he'll throw him back and i'm like what
[50:30] am i supposed to say no i don't grandma
[50:32] i don't listen to anything you say by
[50:34] the way
[50:36] in went the sand crabs but that's not
[50:39] god
[50:40] doesn't have to use reverse psychology
[50:41] with this he just encourages us
[50:44] you can do it and if he ever tells you
[50:46] you can't don't try to do it
[50:49] it's the beauty of it he's like no don't
[50:50] do that you know oh no i can do it i can
[50:51] do all things through christ no sorry
[50:53] that's not it it's not what we meant by
[50:55] that don't do that trust me
[50:57] that's what he's there for he's not
[50:58] trying to trap you he's not trying to
[50:59] trick you
[51:01] this is the advocate reminds us of this
[51:03] truth
[51:05] to keep the access clear remember it's
[51:07] not adversarial
[51:10] he's there as an advocate to remind you
[51:13] he that god is for you brother graham
[51:16] said i used to think jesus loved me and
[51:18] god hated me
[51:19] but he's like wait jesus was god's way
[51:21] to have me
[51:23] like this was he was my he he used jesus
[51:25] not because
[51:26] he was mad at me and jesus loved me and
[51:28] said no god please don't he god had a
[51:30] way to bring you to himself
[51:32] to bring you into fellowship and so the
[51:35] advocate reminds us of these truths this
[51:37] new and living way forever consecrated
[51:39] for us
[51:39] and they want to lead us to a greater
[51:41] understanding of truth
[51:43] so catch that our advocate joins us to
[51:46] our atonement
[51:49] therefore we stand justified forever
[51:54] justified forever there's where
[51:57] you know sometimes maybe when there's
[51:59] been an offense i want you to listen
[52:01] really good now
[52:03] because this is this will get real
[52:04] personal there's times when we've been
[52:07] offended
[52:09] and we don't fully forgive because we
[52:11] want to use the offense to our advantage
[52:13] later
[52:16] right i'm just gonna hold on to a little
[52:19] bit of my fence
[52:20] i forgive you but i'm still gonna use
[52:22] this later
[52:24] so you can bring it up whenever it's to
[52:26] your advantage will you remember when
[52:28] you did this
[52:30] i thought you forgave me for it yeah
[52:31] well but
[52:35] it's this is different now you you
[52:38] did this and you did that and you didn't
[52:40] read all the clauses and did you read
[52:42] the agreement i provided you at the time
[52:44] that i agreed to forgive you no i i
[52:46] didn't know i needed to read the fine
[52:47] print well you should have read the fine
[52:48] print
[52:52] that's not what god's gonna do that's
[52:55] not how god
[52:56] treats us
[53:00] we stand justified forever
[53:05] he doesn't hold back some offense to use
[53:08] so he can get the upper hand with us
[53:12] and through our advocate he he strives
[53:15] with us
[53:15] to maintain uninterrupted access to
[53:17] grace
[53:19] uninterrupted access to god's favor
[53:22] as we read all those things that the
[53:24] advocate is he's there so that we can
[53:26] access help
[53:27] leadership direction comfort
[53:32] not from the position of weakness
[53:36] there was a song i heard many many years
[53:37] ago and actually really liked it i
[53:38] thought it kind of had like a
[53:41] maybe it was it may have been more the
[53:43] music than the uh
[53:45] or the melody more than the words but
[53:47] the words kind of
[53:48] struck this chord that we're the beggars
[53:51] right
[53:51] we're the beggars at the feet of the
[53:53] cross and at first it's kind of yes yes
[53:56] we're just beggars and i realized that's
[53:58] just where
[53:59] that's just where the devil wants to
[54:00] keep us as long as you can just be a
[54:03] beggar
[54:04] at the cross and just never get to the
[54:06] throne you'll be happy with that
[54:09] and so we're not just these beggars at
[54:11] the foot of the cross
[54:13] by the cross we are raised seated with
[54:15] him in heavenly places in christ
[54:17] we have we have through our repentance
[54:19] and through our confession
[54:21] and recognize ourselves to be weak and
[54:23] recognizing ourselves to be sinful
[54:24] through the confession of sin and by
[54:26] identifying ourselves with the sacrifice
[54:28] we are now we are not in a position of
[54:31] weakness anymore
[54:32] but the atonement has put us into
[54:34] fellowship with god
[54:36] now i would join heirs with christ if
[54:39] he's the one hanging on the cross
[54:41] he did it not that we would just be
[54:43] beggars at the cross
[54:44] but that we would be joint heirs with
[54:46] them seated together with him
[54:48] in heavenly places
[54:52] that's that's the image that this the
[54:54] the advocate wants to
[54:55] bring us up to
[54:58] in romans chapter eight
[55:03] i the the uh what i'd like to touch on
[55:06] next time lord willing on sunday
[55:10] is this role of this perpetuation this
[55:11] intercessor he's a mediator
[55:13] he's gonna talk he's a surety he's a
[55:15] mediator
[55:17] job one time cried out and said who's
[55:19] going to act
[55:21] as the days been the bondsman between us
[55:24] here i am a sinful man and here's a
[55:26] righteous god
[55:27] who is it that's going to bring these
[55:29] two parties together
[55:31] into fellowship jesus christ the
[55:34] righteous did that for you
[55:36] he's brought you into fellowship
[55:41] so now look at romans chapter 8 verses
[55:45] 14 to 16.
[55:52] remember the comforter is the holy ghost
[55:56] it is the spirit of god it is your
[55:59] advocate
[56:00] he is your advocate for as many as are
[56:03] led by the spirit of god
[56:06] they are the sons of god
[56:09] as children of god he gives us his
[56:10] spirit to lead us
[56:13] that's what makes us as children that's
[56:15] one of the most important things you
[56:16] have as a son or daughter of god
[56:19] you should guide you should guard that
[56:20] and protect it with everything
[56:23] the individual leadership of the holy
[56:25] spirit within a person's life is so
[56:26] precious
[56:28] then he says for you have not received
[56:30] the spirit
[56:31] of god bondage again to fear but you
[56:34] have received the spirit of adoption
[56:36] whereby we cry abba father the spirit
[56:42] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[56:45] that we are
[56:46] the children of god this is what the
[56:49] advocate does
[56:50] it testifies to you it witnesses to you
[56:54] they that are the children of god are
[56:56] led by the
[56:58] spirit of god therefore we have not
[57:00] received a spirit of bondage to cause us
[57:02] to fear
[57:03] a spirit of legalism a spirit to drive
[57:05] us to do things to force us to do things
[57:08] but yet we have an advocate even on the
[57:10] inside of us with the father
[57:13] the spirit witnessing to our spirit and
[57:16] encouraging us and telling us that we
[57:18] are his children
[57:21] that's what the spirit of god inside of
[57:23] you is to do is to tell you
[57:24] you are mine you are mine you are my son
[57:27] you are my daughter
[57:29] and you'll find as we've tried to
[57:31] substantiate this
[57:32] in the last service and in this service
[57:34] just
[57:35] and we could do so with even more and
[57:37] more statements especially as it relates
[57:38] to the holy ghost
[57:40] this advocacy is the blessing that god
[57:42] bestows upon his family alone
[57:45] those that are led by the spirit of god
[57:48] are the children of god
[57:49] in other words only the children of god
[57:52] have this inside teacher
[57:54] to lead them we could establish a
[57:57] program to where
[57:58] we're all just told what to do all the
[58:00] time right what should i do what should
[58:01] i do we get our marching orders we're
[58:02] told what to do
[58:03] and in that way a church would operate
[58:05] like a family would
[58:06] the parents are the holy ghost to the
[58:08] children until what
[58:11] the children get the holy ghost and so
[58:13] that's the goal that's our goal
[58:15] as in ministry that's our goal and
[58:18] family that's our goal as a church is
[58:19] not that we would always just be very
[58:21] clear on what we're supposed to do and
[58:22] what we're not supposed to do
[58:24] but so that everyone has a relationship
[58:27] established with jesus christ where
[58:29] their soul and god locks together and
[58:31] they become one
[58:32] and you begin to see families led of the
[58:35] holy spirit
[58:36] led of god and the word working mightily
[58:38] in their hearts and working within their
[58:39] lives and then we
[58:40] recognize we come together as a church
[58:43] family to encourage one another
[58:45] in those things
[58:48] because really what i was thinking of
[58:50] and i thought man i just would like to
[58:51] preach the whole sermon
[58:52] from this standpoint the advocate's the
[58:54] difference maker
[58:57] and really that you just have to say it
[58:59] realize i don't have to have part 12 on
[59:01] that you know this is just
[59:02] he's the difference maker that that's it
[59:05] he makes the difference what makes the
[59:07] difference between the old you and the
[59:09] new you
[59:10] the advocate the holy ghost the
[59:12] comforter that's what makes
[59:14] that's what makes you different what
[59:16] what what's the
[59:17] what what makes that you different than
[59:19] those that are stumbling in darkness
[59:21] not you your advocate
[59:25] we can't brag oh i'm just smarter and oh
[59:27] you know what i when i heard this
[59:28] message
[59:28] you know i really picked up on it you
[59:30] know and i really i was able to pick i
[59:32] just poured myself into it and i've
[59:33] always done this and i've always done
[59:35] that
[59:35] let's just all accept the fact that we
[59:37] are who we are today in christ
[59:39] because of the atonement and our
[59:41] advocate
[59:43] if there had not been an atonement our
[59:44] advocate would have left us a long time
[59:46] ago
[59:47] but we have a permanent atonement and
[59:49] our sins haven't been atoned for
[59:51] and us being identified with this
[59:52] sacrifice we become new creatures in
[59:55] christ jesus
[59:56] and by the indwelling of the holy ghost
[59:58] i've had an
[59:59] advocate and he's the one that's kept me
[1:00:04] he's been the difference maker the great
[1:00:07] difference maker
[1:00:09] let me say it's not too late for him to
[1:00:10] make a difference
[1:00:12] it's not too late there's he's still
[1:00:16] working within us to make us what we
[1:00:18] ought to be
[1:00:24] and then one thing i thought well let me
[1:00:27] just read ephesians
[1:00:28] chapter two well let me see if i wanna
[1:00:38] let me just skip ephesians chapter
[1:00:42] 2 but ephesians chapter 2 verses 13 to
[1:00:44] 18 paul is saying
[1:00:46] that jews and gentiles at one time were
[1:00:49] just separated
[1:00:51] became by the sacrifice of jesus christ
[1:00:53] he's abolished
[1:00:54] any enmity to where now we're one
[1:00:58] and he's saying that he's reconciled
[1:01:00] both he's reconciled different
[1:01:02] backgrounds different ethnicities
[1:01:03] different beliefs
[1:01:04] he's reconciled us together in christ
[1:01:06] into one body
[1:01:08] for through him we both have access by
[1:01:10] one spirit under the father
[1:01:12] and i thought the advocate is not only
[1:01:14] the difference maker it's the great
[1:01:15] equalizer
[1:01:17] we're all the same
[1:01:20] there's none among us that should start
[1:01:22] kind of positioning ourselves as wiser
[1:01:25] than somebody else
[1:01:26] because if they've got an advocate
[1:01:29] they have access to all the wisdom in
[1:01:31] the world and it doesn't matter how much
[1:01:33] experience you have
[1:01:34] or how much how long you've been at it
[1:01:36] how long you've been preaching i could
[1:01:37] get up here and say well
[1:01:38] i've been preaching this message for so
[1:01:40] many years you've only been serving god
[1:01:41] a couple of years well the advocate's a
[1:01:43] great equalizer
[1:01:44] because he could come and tell you what
[1:01:46] you need to know now for the time you're
[1:01:48] in having only served the god a year
[1:01:50] and i'm still earning it why because the
[1:01:53] spirit of god that advocates the
[1:01:54] equalizer that brings us all one in
[1:01:56] jesus christ and nobody's looking up to
[1:01:58] anybody else and no one's looking down
[1:01:59] upon anybody
[1:02:00] because we have an advocate with the
[1:02:01] father that raises us up equal in christ
[1:02:05] he's a difference maker he's the
[1:02:07] harmonizer you'll say well
[1:02:08] equalizer you're going to bring me down
[1:02:10] let's just say harmonizer
[1:02:12] brings all of our differences and all of
[1:02:13] our gifts and all of our different
[1:02:15] experiences
[1:02:16] and the advocates harmonize us together
[1:02:18] let us strive for the harmony that ought
[1:02:21] to be seen within the body of christ
[1:02:26] in closing it's our advocate that
[1:02:28] supports us
[1:02:31] he's a teacher he's a leader
[1:02:35] brother branham says don't be afraid we
[1:02:36] have an advocate he silences our fears
[1:02:40] he helps us in our discouragements
[1:02:44] in mark chapter 13 verse 11.
[1:02:50] it was expressed elsewhere with a few
[1:02:51] more verses
[1:02:53] i just pulled this one out in just this
[1:02:54] one verse he says
[1:02:56] but when they shall lead you and deliver
[1:02:57] you up
[1:03:01] it's in the same image that jesus begins
[1:03:03] to speak to the disciples in john
[1:03:04] chapter 14 15 16
[1:03:06] about you're going to be scattered and
[1:03:08] you're going to be sent forth this
[1:03:09] sheep into the midst of wolves and i'm
[1:03:12] going to leave you and when i leave you
[1:03:13] the world's going to hate you because
[1:03:14] they hated me and he begins to paint
[1:03:16] this really really dark picture
[1:03:17] of what's to come it's within that
[1:03:20] context he says but i'm going to give
[1:03:21] you an inside teacher
[1:03:23] i'm going to give you an inner witness
[1:03:25] i'm going to give you an inner strength
[1:03:27] stephen
[1:03:27] don't worry you're going gonna have a
[1:03:29] strength on the inside an advocate there
[1:03:31] who's gonna be holding you up when they
[1:03:33] stone you
[1:03:34] peter don't worry right now you you may
[1:03:36] be denying me but don't worry i've
[1:03:38] prayed for you because one day you're
[1:03:39] gonna be able to stand up and say don't
[1:03:40] crucify me the way they did my lord
[1:03:43] hang me upside down because i'm not
[1:03:45] worthy to die the death that he died and
[1:03:47] you have these apostles and these
[1:03:48] disciples willing to become martyrs how
[1:03:50] did they do it by this inside advocate
[1:03:54] who bore them up and strengthen them and
[1:03:57] so jesus in the spirit of the same
[1:03:59] testimony says but when they shall lead
[1:04:00] you and deliver you up take no thought
[1:04:02] beforehand what you shall speak
[1:04:04] neither do you premeditate
[1:04:07] i had a preacher one time tell me that
[1:04:09] this is the
[1:04:10] the uh well they took issue with the
[1:04:14] fact that i studied all the time
[1:04:16] and uh maybe because they never studied
[1:04:19] but um and they told me why don't you
[1:04:21] just use mark 13 11. take no thought i'm
[1:04:23] like well if i was being delivered
[1:04:25] before my enemy
[1:04:26] you know thanks for the heads up on how
[1:04:29] your congregation views me
[1:04:31] i won't pre-meditate at all i thought i
[1:04:32] was going to church i guess i'm going to
[1:04:34] the council
[1:04:35] but this isn't for when we the work of
[1:04:38] ministry or studying or what the
[1:04:39] preacher should do
[1:04:40] this is the way all of us this is a
[1:04:42] promise all of us have
[1:04:44] when we're put in a situation that maybe
[1:04:45] we're not prepared for
[1:04:47] gonna be called on the carpet we're
[1:04:48] gonna be criticized someone's gonna
[1:04:50] challenge us someone's gonna try to hold
[1:04:52] our feet to the fire
[1:04:53] someone's going to try to really get us
[1:04:54] and work us over pin our ears back
[1:04:56] take no thought beforehand what you
[1:04:57] shall speak neither do you need to
[1:04:59] premeditate
[1:05:00] but whatsoever shall be given you in
[1:05:02] that hour
[1:05:03] that speak ye he says for it is not ye
[1:05:06] that speak
[1:05:07] but the holy ghost the comforter will
[1:05:10] speak for you
[1:05:11] the inside teacher your advocate will
[1:05:14] give you words to speak
[1:05:16] in the time that you need to say don't
[1:05:18] go through this life well i don't know
[1:05:20] if i'm smart enough i don't know if i
[1:05:21] have the wisdom what if they challenge
[1:05:22] me
[1:05:23] what if this happens and what if that
[1:05:24] comes up you rest in the fact
[1:05:26] that you have an advocate on the inside
[1:05:28] he'll tell you what to say
[1:05:31] oh to think that there's times when the
[1:05:33] lion needs to speak
[1:05:35] on your behalf and he'll do it through
[1:05:37] you and there's
[1:05:38] times when the lamb will speak and
[1:05:40] you'll speak
[1:05:41] and it'll be the atonement speaking
[1:05:46] what you shall speak the holy ghost will
[1:05:48] tell you
[1:05:50] that's the advocate because when
[1:05:53] times get tough and the pressure comes
[1:05:54] on he's there for you
[1:05:58] we're all familiar with romans 8 28 all
[1:06:00] things work together for the good
[1:06:02] notice the preceding verses we'll close
[1:06:04] with this the musicians would like to
[1:06:06] come
[1:06:10] romans chapter 8 verses 26 and 27
[1:06:14] likewise the spirit also helpeth
[1:06:17] our infirmities this is the role of your
[1:06:20] advocate
[1:06:21] he helps you in your infirmities
[1:06:24] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:06:27] as we ought
[1:06:31] we don't know how exactly to petition
[1:06:34] god because of our need we don't know
[1:06:36] we're not sure what to ask for anybody
[1:06:37] ever been there before
[1:06:39] i know what my need is but i'm just not
[1:06:41] sure
[1:06:43] what's going to meet it i don't know how
[1:06:45] to pray i don't know how to ask
[1:06:46] notice the beautiful role of the
[1:06:48] advocate but the spirit itself
[1:06:51] maketh intercession for us with
[1:06:53] groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:06:55] where is this spirit the one that's in
[1:06:58] you
[1:06:59] that helps with your infirmities and as
[1:07:02] you pray
[1:07:03] the spirit will make intercession on
[1:07:05] your behalf
[1:07:07] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:07:10] what is in the mind of the spirit what
[1:07:11] is the mind of the spirit
[1:07:13] because he maketh intercessions for the
[1:07:15] saints according to the will of god
[1:07:18] paul is identifying the advocate which
[1:07:21] is acting within us
[1:07:24] not take a number wait in line and hope
[1:07:27] to have an audience
[1:07:29] really a lot of the things that we we
[1:07:30] could see here in hebrews and romans in
[1:07:33] these different places
[1:07:34] is really tearing down the entire
[1:07:37] catholic system
[1:07:40] of the approach to god completely
[1:07:43] tearing it down
[1:07:45] and it was done ahead of time it was
[1:07:47] established before that fact
[1:07:49] and it was put in place that this whole
[1:07:51] idea of even how that mass
[1:07:53] is is called the the sacrificial mess
[1:07:56] they're offering up christ again to be
[1:07:57] sacrificed
[1:07:59] over and over and over again
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:07] but the bible is telling us that the
[1:08:08] spirit within us this
[1:08:11] advocate acting within us it's not
[1:08:14] pleading with god
[1:08:17] but notice what it's doing is directing
[1:08:19] your request
[1:08:22] it's not the holy spirit sees you over
[1:08:24] here tormented and not knowing what to
[1:08:26] do
[1:08:27] and the advocate kind of goes over here
[1:08:28] and talks to god and says
[1:08:30] look i know they've made a lot of
[1:08:31] mistakes you know they keep running up
[1:08:34] against this brick wall
[1:08:35] i know they're not clearly trusting you
[1:08:37] as they should
[1:08:38] but please don't don't let them have
[1:08:40] what's coming to them you know
[1:08:42] if you could just get them out of this
[1:08:43] mess one more time that's not how it
[1:08:45] works
[1:08:47] but when we'll humble ourselves remember
[1:08:50] how you grieve your advocate all you
[1:08:52] gotta do is say i'm sorry
[1:08:53] he's right back what showing you how to
[1:08:54] make things right
[1:08:56] as you begin to pray oh god i'm in a
[1:08:59] horrible situation i don't know what to
[1:09:00] do
[1:09:01] in the holy spirit this is what the
[1:09:02] scripture is describing the spirit helps
[1:09:04] us with our infirmities
[1:09:05] the spirit making intercession for us
[1:09:07] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:09:09] because
[1:09:10] it knows what is the mind of the spirit
[1:09:12] because it intercedes for the saints
[1:09:13] according to the
[1:09:14] will of god the spirit searches our
[1:09:18] hearts it renews our minds
[1:09:20] and now notice this the spirit itself
[1:09:24] advocates for the right cause
[1:09:28] it knows how to speak it'll tell you
[1:09:30] what to speak when you need to say it
[1:09:32] it knows how to it knows what to pray
[1:09:34] for it'll cause you to pray the right
[1:09:36] way
[1:09:38] can you begin to see where the bride's
[1:09:40] advocacy comes from this
[1:09:42] the spirit knows how to motivate you for
[1:09:46] the right cause
[1:09:48] and in a time and day when there's so
[1:09:50] many causes and so many voices and so
[1:09:53] much polarization
[1:09:54] more than ever we need an advocate
[1:09:58] that can tell us the right things to
[1:10:00] advocate for
[1:10:02] let's stand today
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:13] i know i titled this the bride's
[1:10:16] advocate

[1:10:19] coming to me over and over again our
