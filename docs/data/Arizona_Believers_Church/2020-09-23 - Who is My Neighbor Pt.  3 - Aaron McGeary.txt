TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i believe in amen why don't we just lift our voices to heaven and just praise him lord jesus tonight we believe that you're here lord because your word says so to those that believe all things are possible lord we believe the promise that you have come to inhabit our praises lord we believe the promise that where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in our midst so father without doubt we believe that you're here and lord if you're here there's healing here there's freedom here lord there's rapture here father we believe the promises that are coming to pass right before us in this end time so father we can we can see things that seem uh impossible we see things that are overwhelming lord to consider and because we believe we say with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible so tonight lord we just yield ourselves to you we ask that you had come now as you have blessed us with your presence to worship come now and break the bread of life feed our souls lord as only you can we yield ourselves to you we submit ourselves to you bless this time that we have now father in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen take your bibles and turn to luke chapter 10 i'd like to read and start with verse 25 again and read to verse 37. it's nice to see the plets down from flagstaff tonight and that probably makes it just doubly difficult on sister elizabeth that she had to play the piano when they're such an uh accomplished musician in our midst but we can it's nice just maybe take a night off right and just sit and enjoy a service but it's nice to see them and all the many that are out in the house of the lord tonight we just welcome you we're so glad to see you here luke chapter 10 verse 25 says and it's known as the parable of the good samaritan this is the the discussion that leads to it and um i'm going to turn in the right spot i almost began to read in john chapter 10 verse 25 it says and behold a certain lawyer stood up luke chapter 10 verse 25 a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and then jesus just turns the question right back on him he said unto him what is written in the law how readers thou what what what is when the law speaks to eternal life how do you read it what is how do you feel about it he says and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live and so jesus has now turned the question on the questioner and he's put the lawyer in a difficult spot because now the lawyer has testified as to what it takes to have eternal life and then jesus says well then do it just do do what you've said and you'll live and now feeling condemnation or conviction he says but he verse 29 willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbor and jesus answering said and this is where he gives the parable to expound upon who your neighbor is a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him and it even shows that this this care would have taken place over hours even now overnight because it says and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee so whatever you need whatever expenses you incur please take care of them i will make you whole when i come back then jesus asked of the lawyer now which of these three so which now of these three thinketh thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves who do you think lawyer was the neighbor to this one who was wounded a neighbor to this man who was robbed and the lawyer in verse 37 he said he that showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise you can be seated i'm just going to pick up where we were last wednesday night and i don't think that will leave anybody out in doing so because we just want to continue to expound upon this subject of who is my neighbor and i want to read a statement that we had read at the end of towards the end of service from that day on calvary and brother branham says speaking of jesus he says he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself so it wasn't that not living for himself gave him eternal life but the expression or the manifestation that he had eternal life was in that he did not live for himself so eternal life is not characterized by selfish living he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day by receiving christ the sacrifice on that day of calvary and he says and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man and so he's pointing out someone says well how could you stand by and let people criticize you or make fun of you and brother brown's response is well you don't live for yourself anymore if you've accepted the cross if you've received salvation if you're born again by the baptism of the holy ghost then that sets inside of you a different nature that you can live by and and granted we have a flesh that's still sticky and something that we fight against so it's not just instinctive so it's something that we have to feed something that we're instructed in he says now we ought to yield to this unselfish nature that's on the inside of us and live for others he says you live for others that you might redeem that man now what man is he talking about the one that stands by and calls you bad names that's pretty that's pretty heavy stuff but then he brings it down to this he says you become sons and the trouble of it is that the church has forgot they were sons you are sons now he's establishing the fact that you can love or you can react or you can be kind or live for others even to those who do wrong to you because you are a son so there's something about being a son that empowers a person to be able to do good to someone who does evil to them you don't do it because you're weak you don't do it because you're afraid you're going to be bullied you can do it because you are a son he says you're taking christ's place you are sons so don't live for yourself live for others so there's a power inherent in our position as sons and daughters of god whereby we can live for others even those who would do us wrong he says well brother branham i can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man he says that's not it live for the man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could that that i mean that just kind of leaves it wide open because i um and i'm not soliciting people to let me know but i don't know anybody who wants to kill me but he's basically saying hey live for the person that would kill you so he puts it in the furthest most extreme and some of us might say well brother branham you don't have to get all dramatic well he's trying to make a point that you ought to live for the man who hates you live for the one that would kill you if they could that's what they'd done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them and who was it on the day of pentecost that peter preaches salvation too he says you have crucified the lord of glory and they didn't say because of this you're you've negated your ability to be saved he said no you have to receive this very one that you've murdered this very one that you've crucified and so this is the love of god expressed this is the power of overcoming they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then my praise the lord when that when that is in your bosom and that can be in your heart to love the one that hates you and and to resist the urge to even defend yourself or tear down the person who's tearing you down says then you're facing heaven and and wouldn't uh and i wouldn't say anything that would suggest that you're not a christian if you say things critical you do things that are wrong you've just stopped facing heaven it's when we get our eyes off of heaven we get our eyes off the word of god we get our eyes off the nature of christ and then when we're only looking at the carnal then we begin to respond carnally we responded kind we meet the person's intensity if they're angry we get angry back if they're critical we get critical back and we just kind of engage in that in that fight with evil and we start to render evil on the same on the same level but face heaven and you can overcome those instincts that are inherent in our flesh to respond in kind and brother branham we read a number of statements where he said eternal life is living for others and we see that very plain in the message how he just articulates that so beautifully and then he makes a statement that the holy ghost entertains the church with eternal life now we could read that to say the church that has eternal life is entertained by the holy ghost but it struck me this way the holy ghost entertains the church with eternal life in other words the holy ghost the entertainment of the church through the holy ghost is eternal life he entertains us with the eternal life so our entertainment is eternal life and if eternal life is living for others the bride's entertainment is living for others and you might say oh that sounds so boring well okay i'm not gonna i won't argue with you i mean sometimes it might seem to be more of a chore but he's in the bride's entertainment those are my words is living for others it's being in service for our lord because we're called to serve we're called to minister not be ministered to but to minister you are the recipients of a grace grace you are the recipients of the greatest thing that's ever struck the earth you are the recipients of something so supernatural so profound not that we would just lay back and merely be ministered to but to be empowered to minister that's the real beauty of what we've received in this day it doesn't make us helpless it doesn't make us hopeless but it gives us our faith to act it gives us faith to help not be hopeless and to only be helped ourselves and brother brahm talks about how the greatest joy you'll find is in living for others and serving others and that's how i i can see that living for others is our entertainment that if you're selfish then that that will bring you down when you when you only acknowledge your own needs and want others to meet those needs and you're only confessing i'm needy i'm needy i need help i need help and always with your hand out that'll just bring your spirit down but if you can say well i may not have certain things and i'm needy in some areas but what i do have i'll give and how i can help i help you'll find that it'll lift you up and it'll encourage you and give you purpose in life and bring real joy so in this and this i'll say this this is the issue that's central to the answer to the question who is my neighbor in luke 10 29 when the when the lawyer says well then who is my neighbor the it's this what's still central to this discussion is eternal life so he asked how can i obtain eternal life he says well how do you read the law what do you think the law says he says well love the lord thy god and love thy neighbor as thyself and then and jesus says perfect and he goes well then who is my neighbor so the issue still is eternal life and we can see living for living for others loving your neighbor is is harmonious with and speaks of uh love eternal life now so the question in verse 29 is who is my neighbor and when he asks this question and and now we can say review is over i want to i just want to go further in in this i was pondering this afternoon if at any point you feel like brother aaron i get it you can move on just let me know personally if you let somebody else know they might agree with you and then everybody can let everybody else know and then i'm the only one who feels like we don't get it so just let me know he said brother aaron i think we got it you can move on and i'll say excellent and then once i heard from hear from all of you i'll move on don't just wait till after service though so this uh this question that is asked because i realize i may just be laboring something over and over again and seem to be just putting more layers on this but i i believe it's helpful at this juncture so this question of who is my neighbors tied with the commandment or the law that jesus kind of brings up and provokes him about what is written in the law what do you how do you read the law and so this law that the lawyer begins to recite now shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and all thy strength and love thy neighbor as thyself his questions connected with that law now in leviticus chapter 19 verse 18 it says thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but so here's a conjunction so it's thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but so that this conjunction now kind of is the retort or the reply to this avenging and grudging but thou shalt love the lord thy neighbor as thyself i am the lord so it's the lord that's giving this commandment to not avenge not judge excuse me grudge but love thy neighbor as thyself and i wanted to take a moment just to look at these two characteristics of not avenging nor bearing any grudge to avenge means to take vengeance or even just to entertain revengeful feelings so that's that's something that we're all familiar with we're all familiar with how if something happens to you you want to see justice if somebody does something to you you want to do to them what they did to you if not worse and just kind of escalate it so say don't take vengeance or even entertain the thought of they need to be paid back and and they need to get what's coming to them even from a sense of justice even when it's even when that person is acted wrong it's not just saying that you you you're vengeful without cause but even with cause wanting to take vengeance or seek revenge and this would be an illustration of vengeance just to kind of help you understand what the scripture's talking about so an example of vengeance would be if i if i went to brother john and i said brother john can i borrow a shovel and and uh he says uh no you can't borrow my shovel and then the next day he brother john comes to me and says brother aaron can i borrow a rake and then i basically my response to him is no brother john since you wouldn't let me borrow a shovel i'm not going to let you borrow a rake that's what it means to be vengeful and that's exactly what the scripture is talking about that we shouldn't do and i think i put it in terms to where all of us start to feel i'm guilty i've done that before i did that today right because it's just that simple and if my children could listen right now they'd realize this characterizes most of their exchanges well you wouldn't let me play with that so i'm not going to let you play with this what that's vengeance and that really sounds cruel to a five-year-old or an eight-year-old but that's what it is it's that feeling of well since you didn't let me borrow your shovel i'm not gonna let you have my rake and the bible said don't do that that's petty don't engage in that uh here's your opportunity to reverse the cycle or this is your opportunity to kind of change things where he didn't let you borrow the shovel now he wants to ball the rake maybe if you give him the rake he'll let you borrow the shovel because he's going to walk away with the rake and be like wow that was really nice of him i refused my shovel and then he comes back with the shovel and says hey you you wanted to borrow the shovel here's the shovel while i use your rake we have just a way of changing things but this is how feelings become very entrenched and people begin to be polarized because of these kind of attitudes this this feeling of wanting vengeance and then so there it says thou shalt not avenge nor so thou shalt not bear any grudge and to bear a grudge it means to keep in mind or to keep in the word uh the word that's used there in the hebrew to bear any grudge it means to keep or to hold so to keep in mind or a memory of an offense so it's it needs to retain enmity so if somebody does you wrong you just always remember that i can't believe brother john wouldn't let me borrow a shovel it's just a shovel i actually gave him that shovel for his birthday and you just won't let it go you just let it keep eating at you let it keep bothering you and that's what it means to bear a grudge it means you keep it you hold it and so it's it has this sense of retaining this animosity or this bitterness or this offense in your heart and then in the sense that you would want to return the deed that if i ever get a chance oh i know he doesn't have a rake if he ever ever so much as hints that he wants a rake i'm calling him out but it says thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people and in romans chapter 12 verse 19 paul is picking this very theme up he says dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord and this is what god even inserts and he says i am the lord don't avenge don't bear grudge i am the lord and paul writes it in such a way not that we would want to have the wrong motive or rub our hands gleefully waiting for god to strike somebody with lightning but he's saying avenge not yourselves because if you avenge yourselves you take away the liberty of god to deal with the situation fine go ahead get your vengeance that just means i can't deal with it you muddy the picture up you confuse things god's not going to come behind your dealing with it and and vindicate your carnality vindicate your arrogance vindicate your vengeance or even your enmity but rather it says give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord let the lord deal with it avenge not yourselves james chapter 5 verse 9 he says grudge not one against another brother lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door we're commanded very specifically to grudge not against another because it's our grudging that condemns us someone does harm if somebody lies if somebody hurts if somebody offends whatever whatever spectrum you might want to think about in a way that one would do you wrong or someone would do something that's not right or bring an offense or do something selfish or insensitive he's saying don't avenge yourselves and don't grudge once one against another because that person in their wrong by you bearing a grudge you yourself become condemned you could articulate all day long with quote in scripture this person did this he's worthy of hellfire this person did this they're worthy of judgment this person did this they ought to be kicked out of the church this person did this and you begin to grudge now who's condemned you become the one that's condemned not realizing even that that person you might even be a witness to something you're not even a party to it and you see person a do something wrong to person b and you get all worked up about it and you're running person a down and person a down and you're all you're holding a grudge against that person unbeknownst to you that person's made it right all is forgiven and guess who's the only person who's condemned the one grudging so he says don't grudge one another and in this as you see the bible says thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge we see the new testament picking up these principles and reinforcing them then in the old testament leviticus 19 18 the anecdote or the remedy to this avenging and grudging is but love thy neighbor as thyself so it says don't avenge and don't bear a grudge but do the opposite love them instead of seeking vengeance instead of retaining enmity instead of keeping your mind the offense or wanting to take vengeance or entertaining revengeful feelings love thy neighbor as thyself and i was thinking about this just there before services i was pondering it i was reminded how brother branham and he said does this in a couple places or he talks about taking the opposite or suggests this and he's asking the question how can you overcome a complex and brother branham just says take exactly the opposite and it's it's so simple it almost seems like did you did you understand the question i'm very selfish so how can i how can i stop being selfish and brother i'm just like oh if you're selfish just give things away he says take the vice versa if you're if you're if you're selfish just give now in to me this is instructed to the believer this is instructed to those who are filled with the holy ghost in other words he's saying listen dig down deep you've got it inside of you as a christian to do the opposite if you're selfish and not born again well that's to be expected but if you're a son or daughter of god and you have this complex of not wanting to give or you have you feel a certain way brother man says just just dig down deep tap into that reservoir of the holy ghost and do what it would want you to do yield to that he says just take exactly the opposite vice versa he says the remedy is in the anecdote and this is this is what comes to mind when i read this scripture you want revenge you want a grudge just love them and you're like well no that's the problem i i don't really love them look what they did to me and i really hold their grudge you said no love them don't love them from here don't love them in your head don't try to love them with your imagination conscious memory and affection but dig down deep find the love of god in your heart and find your place in scripture and then and exhibit that kind of love that the scripture would want you to hold love thy neighbor as thyself and this is a consistent principle in the scripture we read a couple wednesday nights ago in matthew 19 19 jesus bringing this thing this up in the commandments love thy neighbor as yourself he mentions it again in matthew chapter 22 verses 38 and 39 there's two great commandments the second which is the which is like unto the first love the lord thy god the second one is love thy neighbor as thyself then in romans chapter 13 verses 8 to 10 he says oh no man anything oh no man anything so don't owe anyone something but to love one another so owe no man anything but to love one another so it's no man it's all inclusive it's not uh carving out a niche of humanity uh oh nobody with the last name smith no it's just saying oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self so very powerful paul is bringing this into the teaching to the romans talking about don't o man any man anything love one another if he that loveth one another fulfills the law and then he elicits these laws and he says now any laws briefly summed up in this commandment love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor so if you're going to love your neighbor as yourself it works no ill towards them it says therefore love is fulfilling of the law so it's kind of it summarizes all of it even those things he mentions in verse 9 of thou shalt not commit thou shalt not kill that shall not steal he says love is fulfilling the law because if you had this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself then you would not covet your neighbor's wife if you love your neighbor as yourself then you would not kill you would not steal you would not bear false witness so it's the anecdote it's the remedy that if this love is really in your heart and being expressed it has a way of keeping you from giving yourself over to base carnal instincts of lust and anger and jealousy and then it's written in galatians chapter 5 verse 14 for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this all the law this is paul writing to the galatians that the entire law can be summarized in this one saying thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self the entire law seemingly summed up in this so then you can see how jesus brought this to the rich young ruler to love thy neighbor as thyself he said this is that they'll do us well how he would elicit this great commandment liken unto the first how that even to this lawyer who comes and asked him this question he would say you've said well you've you've said good because now paul is saying that the entire law is fulfilled in the commandment thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself now unless this if it feels like maybe by reading this i'm suggesting this is easy or like oh man this is just check the box if we could just do this we'll be fine the word is in in speaking to this paul you've been writing this a number of times jesus saying it even being placed in the law really what's happening is the word is cutting against our base instincts the word is just saying hey it's not natural for you to do this so it's cutting right against our carnal inclinations and our carnal mind and our carnal emotions are not intrinsically aligned with the word it's not instinctive we're not by nature in harmony with this love thy neighbor as thyself but yet it's just rooted in our human nature to kind of have a bent towards someone or to easily be jealous or when you see somebody else blessed sometimes you think well what about me very rarely do you see children when somebody else gets the bigger piece they're like right on man that's exactly what i wanted i'm so glad you got that no it's usually like uh mom his piece is twice as big as mine and it's not instinctive even in our children it's not instinctive like oh that's he gets to go with you and i don't that's awesome go for it buddy have fun it's always why don't we get to have a friend over why don't we get to go out why don't it because it's just in our nature and so when the bible says love thy neighbor as thyself the word is just cutting right against the the our weaknesses as humans now as we've been as we read from leviticus 19 notice how it says thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but love but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and so this is i want to identify this phrase because this is where i could look back and see written in the old testament where this lawyer may have tried to find his justification because it says thou shalt not avenge or bear grudge against the children of thy people so the lawyer is like well then who is my neighbor and the jews interpreted neighbor very narrowly in their definition of neighbor it did not include the samaritans to a jew a definition of neighbor did not include the gentiles a neighbor meant only an israelite so to you it would say thou shalt not avenge against an israelite nor bear any grudge against the israelites but thou shalt love an israelite as thyself and that's how they would construe the law it meant any israelite either one from the same nation or one of the same religion because you could be a neighbor of the same nation you're related by blood it would be called a neighbor in nature we are of our father abraham of our father isaac and jacob and we're of israel we're children of israel so because we descend from israel we are considering ourselves neighbors because we're neighbors by blood were neighbors in nature but then they would also have a category of people that would be neighbors of the same religion or one who professed to believe the jews faith that would be a proselyte or convert to the jewish faith and that would be a neighbor in law and so they would consider one who has converted from a and and profess the faith of the gen the jews they would consider that one now to be a neighbor because even though they're not blood they've converted and they profess the run one true god so to a jew if you said neighbor you would either have to be related by blood or you would have had denied your idols turned your back on your own family your own blood your own kindred and converted to their religion and to be of the same religion and the the pharisees the sadducees the lawyer here they found support and their own written law and in their oral tradition they would have found it here in leviticus 19 18 not against the children of thy people there's even a phrase i came across in the oral tradition they had where it says when a man sees a gentile fall into the sea he need not take him up so if you saw a gentile drowning you would have no obligation under the law to save them or rescue them while they're drowning now lest you confuse the jewish law with our own law you would have a duty imposed upon you by law that if you saw someone drowning that you would have an obligation or some responsibility to rescue them if you do not put yourself in peril just under own natural laws and so there is when i say natural law even our code whether it be civil or criminal there are certain statues that would obligate you to render aid to someone regardless if they were a jew or not could you imagine if someone was in need and you bypassed them you didn't help them and you and you're charged later you go well they didn't believe the message why was i supposed to stop clearly they weren't a believer and they wouldn't go um yeah we didn't consider that they don't believe like you oh well you know what sorry to bother it wouldn't work that way and so the pharisees they regarded only jews as their neighbor they did not believe that the law obligated to them them to gentiles so the lawyer saw himself as innocent because in his mind the law did not require him to love samaritans the law did not require him to love the gentiles the law only required him to love the jews or to love a proselyte someone who had converted and that was his justification as it says him willing to justify himself he said and who is my neighbor because he would narrowly define those to whom he would have been obligated to love now i want to uh just kind of put the light on you up upon what basis do we seek the same justification and just uh be honest with yourself right now perhaps let the word search your heart how do we justify our own uh uh our own biases our own prejudices our own criticisms how is it we justify even our own disdain or anger or animosity do we do we hold in our own hearts that a neighbor is one who's related to me by blood only that my obligation extends to my family am i immediately family my extended family those that are related to me by blood or we say well brother aaron that's that's too narrow would we actually just use have this principle govern us only as long as it relates to those who profess to believe the message that my neighbor is one who believes the message one who believes maybe uh in the message that we believe and we would have a very strict definition of that and because of that maybe it's really only one who believes the message as i believe it so it wouldn't even be just somebody who believes god sent a prophet but it would be only if you believe that god sent a prophet and that he taught xyz and if you don't believe it just that way then you're really not my neighbor how is it that we begin then to justify our attitudes our judgments uh our our biases our prejudices all these different things that we might have against somebody even our oughts or even our criticisms how is it that we justify it is our neighbor only those who have not hurt me or offended me is my neighbor only those who've been good to me do i feel justified in my bitterness do i feel justified in my grudging because someone has offended me or because of my differences with somebody else that merely because one does not believe the way you do you can justify a wrong attitude towards them where you might even begin to feel experience a feeling of anger animosity or even disdain whatever the feeling might be but then you realize you know what they don't even believe like i do and because you can turn your emotions around and just try to put a stamp on it well this is just righteous indignation and and just trying to attribute it to the fact that there's difference of opinion there's differences in the way that you believe things and it reminds me this is something that's been uh very very heavy on my heart over the past year or this year at least how that when the children of israel they sent out spies 12 men to go into the promised land and spy out the promised land and when the 12 spies came back after 40 days of search and they came back and they said we saw the land it was just exactly the way that we said it you said it was flowing with milk and honey this is the fruit of it they had all the fruits of it but then they said there's strong men that dwell in that land and we saw the children of enoch we saw the amalekites we saw all the ones that dwelled there and as they're bringing up this negative report it suggested yes the land is good here's the evidence but those that live in the land are too great for us and if you could just picture 10 men they're saying listen they're too big they're too big they're too big and that's what's suggested by the language they're using in numbers 13 verses 26 to 29 but then caleb the dog the gentile he stilled the people before moses and said notice his language let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it now notice caleb didn't say let me and joshua go because the rest of these guys are knuckleheads let joshua and caleb go up with our people because the rest of these guys are make believers at best unbelievers most likely they have they only believe the opening of the word they don't even believe the prophet really really look come on really guys get a dna test how could you even be jews he said no no no guys you've got it all wrong we are able notice he used we he said us caleb was willing to put his arm around the ten who just began to speak against the promise and say no brother we're able and then the sin and the heir of the ten was not that they didn't believe they could they could take it but it says but then the men went up with him and said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and their heir wasn't in believing they were stronger their heir wasn't believing that they weren't able to go up against it the air was in believing that joshua and caleb couldn't the heir was made manifest and they brought all the other 11 down just for one to say well i'm not a very good fighter there's no way i could whip them or my tribe we're just not that experienced but i don't think we can what they did is they brought everyone else down and said if i can't you can't either and that was the sin that was the air that's manifest here in numbers chapter 13. it wasn't that one felt weak or one felt unable but it was that the other person brought the other one down where was the strength of caleb to even look at the very ones who said they couldn't and say yes you can but but i don't think i can i don't think i said yes you can and that's why i believe that we can look upon somebody someone who may not believe what we believe and we and we don't water down the truth we don't change it to satisfy someone who looks at something something differently but we call someone brother not because they believe what we believe and or not because we're not convinced of what we believe but because we believe that they can believe also we can call him brother we can call him sister not because we're watering down what we believe but we can believe i'm a son they could be a son too i'm a daughter they can be a daughter too i can possess it they can possess it too and we change our language not because we're weak not because we're changing what we believe or watering it down or thinking well it doesn't matter how you're baptized but we believe that they can come to an understanding of how to be baptized too praise the lord and so in this thought as we're challenging our perceptions and our attitudes and how we seek to justify ourselves on a particular basis do i make someone my enemy to justify my criticisms to justify my gossip to justify my hatred and part of the inspiration when the lord began to lay this upon my heart back in june when and it was just almost immediately when the lord was commissioning us and calling us to come here and start a church and this is it's just personal for us here at arizona believers immediately he laid upon my heart in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and then immediately who is thy neighbor and these things began to be so heavy upon my heart as i pondered them and what this this unction that came behind this thought of who is my neighbor was how that it was it's often said by about brother branham and his brother billy paul i believe who shares the testimony and that's where we derive this from but he says one of the most outstanding characteristics about brother branham is you could not tell brother branham's friends from his enemies so in word and deed you would not be able to discern foe or from friend now ponder that think about that one of the most outstanding characteristics about brother branham is you you could not tell who his friend was and who his enemy was not that he didn't know be but that you would not know by his conduct or his conversation you would not know who his friend was and who his enemy was and the story is even told how that brother branham was asked to be a part of a meeting and brother branham is sitting there he's just on the other side of this curtain waiting to be called out and the pastor gets up at this great meeting he says after he's taken up the offering and everything he says brother branham was not able to be with us at this time he was called away we're very sorry and then just off the side of the platform there's brother branham sitting there and and the brother says to brother branham brother branham can you believe this and i'm sorry if i get the exact words right it definitely is a game of telephone at this point and brother he says brother branham why don't you just correct it right now all brother brandon would have to do is take a few steps he wouldn't even have to go all the way to the platform and push the push the pastor out the way and say i'm here what were you thinking all he'd have to do is just maybe look out the curtains be like just enough maybe not for everybody but just a few just step over into the peripheral just enough to see a few people go just enough just for a few and and we would think maybe he'd be justified in exposing this kind of lie what kind of heresy is this and you know what brother brown's response was oh and do that to him in front of his people i could i couldn't do that how about the think about the the depth of thought to that how that here was one that instinctively we could say that man deserves to be exposed but brother branham realizes if that man is exposed untimely what would it do to a young convert what would it do to the people who are looking to this man who even have confidence in him because he invited brother branham to come out what kind of confusion would that so to just so instinctively try to rip something open expose it call it out for what it is say oh in front of his people no i couldn't do that and so with brother branham he had a testimony that you could not tell his friends from his enemies and that's that ought to inspire us you would not want somebody to be so easily say well i know exactly who he hates and i know who he likes you you'd want you'd want to have the kind of testosterone says well manny you you'd think he's friends with everybody you think he gets along with everybody and now as we go further in this and what i how the lord's inspired me in this looking at this subject of the the parable of the good samaritan you might be asking brother aaron when are you going to get to the parable well i'm trying to just take what what has spoken to us from it and just maybe look outside of it and if the lord would have us to look into it more specifically we will do a little bit tonight we can do so because there's so many things that are uh very instructive to us how we could look at how the relationship of this man that went down from jericho what it would have been to a priest what would it would have been to the levite the relationships between these people or even among them and there's a lot of different ways to look at it but the answer that jesus gives in the parable of the good samaritan it's a rebuttal to her it opposes this lawyer's position that his neighbor is only a jew could you see that now that what jesus has done is he's refuted what's in this lawyer's mind that when he says well who is my neighbor jesus can understand now that this lawyer is going to have a very narrow definition of what a neighbor is and he's going to take the position that a neighbor is a jew or one who's converted to judaism and so jesus gives him an answer that refutes that because your neighbor even for us your neighbor is more than blood relation your neighbor is more than just doctrinal affiliation or agreement within doctrine it's more than just doctrinal association or affinity within the things you believe your neighbor is more than blood it's more than belief the very greek word that's used in the scripture for neighbor means one who is near in the english the anglo-saxon it means he who is next and so the lord answers the lord's answer as he gives this parable it frames the issue within this context that someone is in need or distress because there's it's it's not being there there's nothing in the word that would require you to go beyond the word does that sound like a dust statement you know the word won't ask you to deny the word they won't ask won't ask you to to break the word so the to the love thy neighbor as thyself it's not creating this commandment that then usurps every other commandment that i'm loving my neighbor therefore i'm going to abandon conviction i'm going to abandon steadfastness i'm going to abandon obedience well i guess i've got to love my neighbor so i'm just not going to be holy today it's not he's not there's nothing in this word that's going to suggest you to go outside the bounds of the word but jesus does take this parable of the good samaritan and he places it in context of asking yourself who's your neighbor when someone is in need or distress because he asked the question after he kind of goes through the story in verse 36 which now of these three the levite the priest or the samaritan which one of these these three do you think was a neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves so jesus's question is not identifying who will neighbor you and using it as a verb who will neighbor you who will be a neighbor to you but rather his question is who will you neighbor so it's not that he's asking us well who will we let be a neighbor to us who will neighbor you who is going to give to you who's going to serve you who's going to take care of you but rather who will you be a neighbor to who will you neighbor who will you help and their need or their distress because he's he's he's narrowing this down do we only know do we only owe a duty to do good to our family do we only owe a duty to do good to our friends do we only owe a duty to help the same when they're in need that i'll help a friend out if he's hurting i'll help a family member out if he's hurting because what jesus identifies in this parable the good samaritan is that the duty that we owe to a needy neighbor to someone in need disregards nationality it disregards religion it disregards kindred in other words it does not take into account are we related it does not take into account do we believe the same thing it does not take into account are we of the same faith or same nationality jesus is actually espousing in this parable that look the one who was neighbor to the one who was hurt was the one who disregarded the faith disregarded the nationality disregarded the blood relation and when he saw a fellow man in need he instinctively acted to see that he was taken care of so jesus is identifying that we when we see somebody in need and we see a need that we can meet then we ought to meet it and not go through this rationalization of are they worthy do they believe the same are they related of what segment of society they belong in and then if we could find some mark against them say well i would have helped them but i know who they voted for in the last election and they're just getting what's coming to them and if you will ponder this because i i you you maybe you hear that and it seems just uh it seems very obvious but it just struck me so heavy earlier today and i thought well yes yes think it just became a revelation to me if we begin to divide among who we're willing to help in these things then it'll naturally carry over in who we think is worthy of the gospel it'll naturally carry over into who we pray for in believing naturally carry over to who we believe it can be and receive salvation and how else could we fulfill our great commission if we discriminate or judge carnally jesus saying is you do good unto those and you help the needy the oppressed the the broken the hurting help them if you have what they need help them and take care of them and do it regardless of their faith regardless of their background regardless of their nationality regardless of blood relation and be instinctive in doing so when you see somebody who needs mercy because how could we ever fulfill the great commission that the church has given if it's instinctive for us to judge carnally and discern who we carnally discern who we think we can help and who we can't by no means suggestion that we would ever cast our pearls before swine or not use wisdom or discretion and things that we say and do but we're attacking the heart of prejudice we're attacking the heart of bias we're attacking these value judgments and assessments we make in our minds when we deem some people worthy and others not when we're quick quick to criticize some and tear down others but then we're blind to things that we might have weaknesses ourselves listen to the great commission and just imagine if we weren't instructed by the word to lay aside these kind of these differences when someone is needy and someone is in help and deserves mercy needs mercy because a sinner needs mercy just as much as this one who is coming down from jerusalem to jericho just as much as this one needed mercy so does a sinner need mercy so does a backslidden person need mercy and if you would look at this one who is laying in the ditch and say well i have all these reasons for not doing it then that same thought process would enter in when you see someone who needs the mercy of this message needs the grace of this message you will just instinctively bury it hide it walk around them avoid them the great commission listen to it he said unto them mark chapter 16 verses 15 to 18 go ye into all the world except those nations that are no all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that is 5 eight and above no such qualification i think i put five eight if they ask me my height i guarantee you i'm probably short of that but i just round up it reminds me that the sheepdog who could talk and the the farmer told him to go round up the sheep and so he did he came back and said how many were there and he said 40 and the farmer said i thought there was 39. he said you asked me to round them up he says go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned it's according to their faith it's according to their reception it has nothing to do with our perceptions of people and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils no qualification as to which ones you're casting out they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover how is it we could fulfill the great commission if we have some prejudice in our mind some faulty judgment in our mind some kind of filter or factor that we use when we assess someone's worth or whether or not they they deserve mercy or whether or not they should be ministered to how could we go into all the world and preach to every creature lay hands on the sick and cast out devils if we cannot get it right to love our neighbor as ourselves i found this statement in one of the commentaries and i just will read it exactly as i found it you ought to ask who wants my help i thought that was very good ask yourself who wants my help neighborhood consists not in what you receive but in what you give it is independent of race creed and the ordinary sentiment of pity love overleaps over leaps all these distinctions and risk its very life in order to render help that's powerful neighborhood being neighborly loving your neighbors yourself consist not in what you can get from them but in what you can give to them it's independent of race and creed or just even normal sentiments of of kindness and pity but rather it's something that love the love of god constrains you the love of god motivates you in leviticus chapter 19 verse 18 we read how it says thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself i am the lord we speculated that maybe this lawyer might have found his justification this very verse that well it says against the children of thy people i believe it could be proved that the jews the pharisees this lawyer narrowly construed what it meant to be a neighbor to those who were of the household of faith to those who were jews but in verse 33 of leviticus 19 verses 33 to 34 it says and if a stranger's soul journe with thee in your land ye shall not vex him so now it takes a stranger stranger would be a a gentile samaritan a reprobate a heathen those who are outside of the faith ones that were not born of the children of israel if there's a stranger living in your land don't vex him don't harass him don't trouble him don't even constantly remind him where he comes from this is what the scripture is telling us don't vex him but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one one born among you and thou shalt love him as thy self it completely demolishes this very narrow view of what what a a neighbor is oh well it's only a jew it's only one who's converted to our religion no if a stranger dwells in your land then treat him like one who's born among you love him as yourself then it says for ye were strangers in the land of egypt i am the lord your god have you not forgotten that you were strangers once yourself in egypt when you find one who's fallen and one who's overtaken in a fault ye are spiritual restore such a one and meekness and fear considering your own selves remember that you at one time may we were fallen you at one time were broken and someone had care upon you and reached out to you and restored you and showed kindness of you and he said listen remember one time you were strangers in a land and you received kindness from the egyptians he's saying don't even regard what they did to you in the end remember one time you were a stranger remember what it felt like remember the fears you had remember the abuse you endured remember what you went through jesus said whatever god's saying whatever you do don't perpetuate the cycle ye who are abused don't become the abuser you who are rejected don't become the rejecter you who've endured it you know what it feels like change it and become empathetic if you know what it's like to be rejected then become one who reaches out if you know what it's like to be one who's abused and comfort the one who's abused don't become the abuser don't because the one that because i was treated this way i'm going to treat those because i've been rejected i'm going to reject because you won't fellowship with me i won't fellowship with you that's vengeance but the very law right then the very same chapter says don't vex him the stranger who lives with you who's not a jew who doesn't profess your faith treat him as one who's born among you treat him like a brother and love him as yourself in other words even the one who's amongst you who is not your blood and not your brother in the faith love them as a neighbor love them as yourself treat them as one who's born among you and if you pondered in light of what we mentioned a moment ago about the great commission how could israel bring strangers to the knowledge of the one true god to the worship of the one true god if they always mistreated them how many candidates would they have to to be converted how many would be willing to believe in this one true god if they were always vexed they were treated as an outcast it was even put in terms now listen i could love you but you need to convert first i would let you borrow my rake if you were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but so how would that go over in in what the word is teaching these israelites teaching the jews how could they ever bring one to desire the the to serve the one true god if those who believed in the one true god are always mistreating everybody who doesn't believe in the one true god you know what most people say i don't want any of that if that's what their god turns them into then i don't want that and that's what turns a lot of people away from so-called christianity and the christ we serve is because the people who claim to believe in him mistreat other people and in doing so profane the name of christ i was singing a song today be salty or i'm salty i'm not remembering the words just exactly right i'm salty and i thought it's really a paradox because to today if you're salty you're uh you're bitter you're harsh you're cruel but it says you're the salt of the earth i took this out of my notes and i'm still preaching it anyway so who knows where we're gonna end up now i thought maybe we would give it more time so i'll just kind of lay these seeds in there maybe wet your appetite a little bit you are the salt of the earth if the salt loses its savior how's the earth gonna ever be salted where's the preservation where's the curing where's the healing if the bride and the elect can't be salty the only thing that's left is for the world to be salty don't be salty be salty don't be salty like the world be salty like christ tells us to be that it would make somebody thirsty i was reading all these places it came up so often when brother bran is being asked in question and answers things about unbelievers he was like just be salty i got a husband that doesn't believe just be salty i have a friend that i really want to know the truth just be salty that doesn't mean in our parlance today have an attitude he says don't push anything on them be salty how can you be salty love them as yourself in luke chapter 10 now we'll read a portion of this verses 30-32 notice this as we're talking about being salty about how love the stranger that dwells with you as yourself go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature thinking about this duty that we oh man all men fellow men those who are in need we have a duty to those or need to give them something if we have what they need to help them i believe that requires some maturity and some wisdom but notice it says in luke chapter 10 verses 30 to 32 in direct answering now to who is thy neighbor he says a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho brother bam identified this as a man going down from where he ought to be to jericho which represents the world this is someone who's backsliding says and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead so this is the condition of this one who's going down from jerusalem if we put it in terms that this is a jew who's backslid then we might say well it serves him right that he would fall among thieves be stripped and wounded and left half dead because he left jerusalem he was taking a dangerous way what would you expect he gets what he deserved we might just call it karma then it's peculiar in that it says and by chance there came down a certain priest that way so if we're seeing if he's taken the same path could it be that this is a backslidden priest and he gets lucky he doesn't fall among thieves but as he's taken the same path of the jew who went down from jerusalem to jericho and i think it's kind of assumed that it would be a man of faith or a jew it says when he came by chance by where as came a certain priest that way when he saw him he passed by on the other side so now the priest is taking the same path and when he sees this one in need sees one who's harmed he just steps away and passes by the other side and who knows what's going through his head when he does so and likewise verse 32 and likewise a levite now there's something we can learn from scripture here not every levite's a priest and that's so in the old testament not every levite entered into the priesthood but there were levites who were called to serve in the temple that wouldn't necessarily be priests so when you see this distinction you might think oh levites are priests no not all levites entered the priesthood so you had a priest who would have been of the same tribe who went by psalm half dead let's get on the other side now levi when he was at the same place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side and what struck me today as i read this was missed opportunity that here was an opportunity for a priest to minister to someone to do good unto him to restore somebody who had gone from jerusalem to jericho and maybe they were in a mess of their own doing maybe they were getting what they deserved but now it was an opportunity for this this priest to minister to one and to show kindness to somebody to encourage them and give them a glimpse of faith give them a glimpse of love give them an opportunity to see christ lived out the god of truth lived out to see a hope to see a resource to see something that's worth living for here was an opportunity it was a missed opportunity this is a priest one who should have been inclined to serve he missed that opportunity now a levite one who ought to have been inclined to serve pass by on the other side what was it a miss opportunity to display the nature of the one true god that they were called to serve to fulfill leviticus 19 and to love someone as their selves and brother bradley makes a statement when he writes in the church age book chapter 9 about laodicea i'm going to read it and then i want to phrase it a little bit differently not to change the context but to get you think about it even in a more pointed way and this speaks this quote may seem to be a little bit out of context i apologize that would be my fault for not uh uh i'm making the proper connection but perhaps the holy spirit can just blend this together brother brown says this elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect all those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the cane line the serpent seed they build their babbles they build their cities they build their empires and all the wild calling on god they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the lord to destroy god's elect ones now that's incredible now let me just read it this way elect cannot persecute elect cannot harm it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy they hate and they'll do all they can even in the name of the lord to destroy in other words it's not that elect don't persecute elect and it's not that elect cannot persecute elect or elect cannot harm elect elect do not harm anyone the elect don't persecute anyone it's not the elect the persecute the reprobates it's not the elect that persecute the unbeliever it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy it's they who are of that line of cain that hate they are the ones that do all they can to destroy the elect cannot destroy the elect cannot persecute the elect cannot harm anyone so it's not that we have this in our mind well elect don't persecute elect are they elect no persecute that that's not what brother branham's saying when he says elect cannot persecute elect he's trying to give us understanding that if you see someone persecuting they cannot be elect and if we as the elect are persecuting or destroying we are working off of our base instincts our carnal nature our own insecurities our own complexes and not the nature of christ that resides in us by the baptism of the holy ghost or we need that elect seed to be quickened which is the new birth let it come to life so that we can resist the urge to persecute resist the urge to destroy even in defense of our good name because elect cannot harm elect cannot persecute elect cannot destroy it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy those characteristics are not assigned to the elect regardless of the one who's receiving the persecution regardless of the one who's receiving the destroying that's why we do not need to defend the catholic church or those who use the name of christianity to go on their crusades and stand at the walls of cities and say renounce your religion renounce your son god accept the holy church and do so now or we will destroy you all and that's very a very horrible summary of what they were doing in the crusades but from spain and all these places they came over to north america and in the name of the bible in the name of christ destroyed genocide destroyed tribes destroyed other nations all because they would not resound renounce their idols and it was put to him you renounce what you believe you renounce your faith or we will be justified and destroy you from the face of the earth and don't think that you're better because you won't take the natural life if you do the same exact thing with your convictions today spiritually it was said the other day in our household it was preston who said something about somebody said that man's a murderer we're like oh my goodness gracious you go brother branham said you speak against somebody somebody's character you murder him i told him we're going to be we're going to watch it with this guy and he was identifying it already brother badam said he took it that simply he said that's a that's a murderer that's what brother branham was saying that we we operate under the same spirit it gets into our flesh our carna our complexes are our carnality our insecurities i'm not speaking to your election i'm identifying the humanity the human part we're all guilty of it there's not a minister in this message that could stand behind this pulpit and preach this guiltless or blameless as if they never said something negative about somebody else or have the wrong attitude to somebody who saw things differently we're all guilty because our humanity but i'm imploring you by the word of god to the christ that is in you to recognize these instincts and realize that as the elect i have no need to persecute as the elect i have no need to harm but rather i have what it takes to compel the seed in somebody else or to meet the needs where others are hurting jesus says it this way matthew chapter 5 verses 38 to 48 so many scriptures we'd like to read says ye have heard that hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that you resist not evil evil someone takes your eye you take their eye they take your tooth you take their tooth he says you're not resisting evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and this isn't a countdown i got one cheek left buddy no he's just saying look don't render for evil evil and if any man will soothe thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go mild go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not thou away give her that it hath been said so now jesus is uncovering something in their theology you've heard it said in your in your torah you've heard it said in your time and you've heard it spoken before thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy this is something they said love your neighbor hate your enemy what have we taught hate the sin love the sinner thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you you are to d did you read it with me love your enemies well so you have to know who your enemies are so you just do not love indiscriminately but your love is without dissimilation you have discernment to recognize that man hates me that man argues against the word that man hates the message that man reasons against one punctuation of the word and because of that he's my enemy but you know what the bible says love them love your enemies bless them that curse you if they curse you you do not withhold your blessing it says you bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you it doesn't say if they hate you withhold good he says pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute does not say withhold your prayer if they persecute you or use you it says pray for them so in cursing and hatred and despitefully using and persecution our response is not to withhold but is to love to bless to do good and to pray why that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven this is the mark this is the distinction of a real queer christian they can pray for someone who uses them they can bless somebody who curses them they can love their enemies as even as they would love their neighbors for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send it reign on the just and on the unjust brother branham expounds upon that so often for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same if you only love your neighbor and hate your enemy if you only love those who are blood relation only love those who go to church with you only they'll love those whose doctrine aligns more closely with you then what reward is there do not even the publicans do the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and so is it not true that people often times will refuse to refuse to call you brother but rather mister or something else as a sign of disrespect to show to you i don't believe like you do and i will admit that myself at one time just being maybe very legalistic i say maybe it was be legalistic with the message i would have this idea how could you be a brother and deny the great truths that are in this message and i can say maybe technically i'm right but i'm not in harmony with the word though technically in compliance i'm completely outside the spirit and the intent of this word the real feeling of this word how can you salute your brethren and not salute others do not the republicans do the same oh hi brother so and so oh hi mister so and so shake this guy's hand until you say signaling right letting everybody else know i hope you're paying attention this guy's a believer this guy at best and after he says this you're resisting not evil to do an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth you're resisting not evil when you return and kind you're responding kind but love your neighbor love to love your enemies bless them that curse you do good unto them they hate you pray for them that use you and persecute you to prove to show that you're of your father which is in heaven so he says he concludes the whole thing be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and if i could add i believe jesus in doing so gives us a grace to help us to understand that this is not instinctive by natural birth this is not instinctive by carnal thought process but rather only by submission to him can you render really to those that are mentioned here in the scripture the things that the scripture requires be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect this scripture is often used in the context that we ought to live holy and dress holy and act holy and believe holy and and the mark of this age is perfection and we use it to speak of the believer that's coming into perfection that's born into the full manifestation of the word of god that which is perfect has come be there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect but jesus uses to amplify the truth to love your enemies to bless those that curse you to do good to them that hate you and pray for them that use you and persecute you and he says i know this is hard but you got to be perfect like your heavenly father is perfect in closing i'd just like to read two statements in works that i do bear witness of me brother brother says i don't care how long you've been a deacon deaconship ain't going to take you to heaven it's the blood of jesus christ that shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit that's going to take you up so you must be right with god with a good mellow sweet feeling towards everybody i want a good mellow sweet feeling towards everybody ready to do a favor and be a kind brother or sister to the person that you really know is your enemy i'm going to read it again he's talking about having the holy spirit in our hearts right with god with a good mellow sweet feeling towards everybody ready to do a favor and be a kind brother sister to the person that you really know is your enemy so you really know they're your enemy you haven't gone through this process of trying to reason and wrestle and say okay i think they're my enemy let me dissect this let me tear this apart you know what i'm not so sure they are my enemy so you know what i'll do i'll do them a favor and be kind to them because i'm not really sure they're my enemy but he's saying to the one you know that you know they're your enemy you still ought to be ready to do a favor and be kind to that person and then close in sister elizabeth if you come from that time brother branham says today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming returning good for evil now catch that power is overcoming the urge to return good for evil power is overcoming this instinct this human re reflex of returning good for evil he says that's real power power is overcoming returning good for evil now living above this attitude this instinct this desire this carnal process of returning good for evil he says that's real power real power is resisting the urge to render evil for good power is overcoming returning when others have done evil to you returning good for you power is overcoming power is returning good for evil that's real power power is not returning evil for evil that can love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you isn't that beautiful power is overcoming and not just merely overcoming sin but when evil is done to you returning good for evil that you can love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's god's power [Music] he says yes maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil from his heart not because of religious duty but from his heart takes a real man to not say because you hurt me i'll hurt you he says it's a real man that does it power is overcoming power is returning good when you've received evil so that's real power that you can love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you a real man [Music] returns good for evil in other words when you've received evil you return good from the heart i'll say this just as a not as a caveat but maybe is it some qualification i'm not redefining love [Music] the bible says god is love the bible says god is his word true love cannot be expressed apart from the word so i'm not redefining love i'm not trying to encourage compromise i'm speaking very directly to this principle of who is my neighbor in challenging some of our own instincts our own judgments our own biases our own prejudices to ask ourselves who is my neighbor and to consider all these different things that lay within this message that in this hour only those who are perfect will truly be able to express let's stand tonight appreciate your patience and your diligence just to stay focused as the word is going forth it's certainly a credit to you i can sense such a a real hunger in your hearts now as we bow our heads just offer prayer our gracious heavenly father lord the word is challenging we acknowledge that lord we recognize that [Music] it's it's our instinct lord that when we have been offended even for self-preservation lord even to sustain a feeling of self-worth and to protect ourselves from emotional scars and to keep ourselves from succumbing to anxiety and oppression lord to keep ourselves from being overcome with grief and sadness many times we try to defend ourselves and kick against our oppressor and speak out against those that speak against us lord it's not that we are guilty many times because we're evil lord we're guilty many times because evil is done to us but i look into the word and the word does not make any distinction that when we have been done evil too we're justified for rendering evil but rather even so lord when we have been done evil too when we have taken evil we take it patiently when we have done been done harm when we've been aggrieved we must take it patiently [Music] lord i pray that you would help us these things are not easy lord i pray that we could forgive those who've hurt us release our cares to you lord not grudge not avenge [Music] regardless of how fresh the wounds may feel lord we're praying now father to help us to let go to not grudge to not avenge to no longer keep it but to let it go not because lord we want to justify their behavior not because we believe we deserved it not because we believed that they were not wrong but rather because we are sons we are daughters vengeance is yours saith the lord i'm going to walk in your grace i'm going to walk in your deliverance i'm going to walk in your healing lord you're going know pray lord that as we are commanded to be perfect even as you which are in heaven is perfect lord i ask and pray that you would be glorified in my life [Music] that others would have a hard time recognizing whose friend and whose foe because i've learned to love even my enemies as myself [Music] learn to love the stranger among me lord i've learned to love like you love lord not so that we would be wishy-washy not that we would compromise not because we're redefining love and making it sloppy agape or some kind of silly filio lord but rather because we know true father and because this truth must find that last seed and how can we rescue the hopeless lord how can we rescue the hurting how can we find and discover that last seed if we're too busy casting aspersion and disdaining and hating and separating from everyone who doesn't look like us and doesn't believe like us so i pray father you would help us have the kind of character it's going to take in this end time to find that last soul find the hurting sheep in this valley to be christ to those who've longed so long to see it and have only received a false image i pray you give us church of grace to manifest you lord to be neighborly not in what we can get from our neighbors but what can we give to serve and not to be served i commit to you these ones tonight lord we stand each one we're on our feet now and we confess with one heart we have been commissioned we have been appointed we receive it now in the name of the lord jesus christ i will walk in my healing i will walk in my liberty i'll walk with forgiveness in my heart i will lay aside grudges i will no longer revenge i will cast it unto you you are the one who is the judge you are the one who take vengeance lord we leave it to you we hold no right of justice we lay it at your feet we go forward to serve to minister and to love even our enemies father we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and it
