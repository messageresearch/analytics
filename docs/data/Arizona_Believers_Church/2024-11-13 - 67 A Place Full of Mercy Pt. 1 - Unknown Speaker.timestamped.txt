[0:00] I'm going to take just a little bit of a
[0:02] different title today and um maybe over
[0:05] the next few Services take the title A
[0:07] Place full of mercy and this would be
[0:10] part one I'm just kind of planning for
[0:12] maybe uh four parts on this and just to
[0:15] connect these together we've been
[0:16] preaching on is there room for Mercy
[0:18] asking the question if there's room and
[0:19] I believe that through those Services
[0:21] though it wasn't exhaustive we've seen
[0:23] that this is a time of judgment that
[0:26] this is a dispensation where we can see
[0:28] in the message of the hour that there's
[0:29] a Binding Together uh of different
[0:32] things for the purpose of uh judgment
[0:36] and that there's a loosing of the Bride
[0:37] of vindication and a Justice to the
[0:39] bride a lot of things that we could
[0:40] share but this is a time of judgment so
[0:43] there is a a changing in the time we're
[0:45] living in brother BR talks about the
[0:47] wigged one and the supreme authority
[0:49] being revealed and we see even in the
[0:51] message of the hour that when brother
[0:53] brandham is identifying events that are
[0:55] related to Revelations chap 5 and even
[0:57] the revealing of the son of man it
[0:59] caused him to to ask the question is the
[1:01] day of Mercy over and he's asked very
[1:04] specifically in 1964 is there no more
[1:06] mercy and he says no there is Mercy and
[1:09] he goes on to uh answer that question
[1:12] maybe we'll get into it in more detail
[1:13] some other time but we can see that
[1:16] though this is a time of judgment and
[1:18] that times have changed and seasons have
[1:20] changed we're in this age of the son of
[1:22] man there's still room for Mercy or if I
[1:25] could say this way place for mercy and
[1:27] so we're wanting to look at this idea of
[1:30] a place that just doesn't have mercy but
[1:31] it's full of mercy and something I trust
[1:34] you've been finding in your own personal
[1:36] devotion and in the word of God as you
[1:38] just read the Bible and if you were
[1:40] looking for these things if you're
[1:41] looking for mercy and trying to study it
[1:43] you'll certainly have found this um but
[1:45] if you're just reading your Bible it's
[1:46] almost impossible not to come up against
[1:48] it but God is full of Mercy he is
[1:52] merciful and we talk about a Place full
[1:54] of Mercy I had maybe called this uh a
[1:57] home full of Mercy was maybe one of my
[1:59] first working titles but I'll put it
[2:01] this way a Place full of mercy and this
[2:03] ought to be in your heart as an
[2:05] individual there ought to be a Place
[2:07] full of Mercy in our homes our families
[2:09] there should be Mercy should be a
[2:11] dominant characteristic within our homes
[2:14] and certainly as a church we should be a
[2:16] place that is full of Mercy we know that
[2:18] judgment begins at the house of God and
[2:20] that there's a judgment aspect and
[2:22] there's uh things that um go forth from
[2:24] the word of God and things that are
[2:26] handled but yet we don't do it in a
[2:27] worldly way we don't do it in a carnal
[2:29] way
[2:30] and we don't do it because we're just
[2:31] full of Wrath and we we want Vindication
[2:34] and we want uh sin to be punished but
[2:36] rather we we judge according to God's
[2:39] word we let God be the judge and we know
[2:41] that with judgment there is Mercy now if
[2:44] you could look at Genesis Chapter 18
[2:46] I'll start with verse 16 uh I'm not
[2:48] going to go all the way to verse 33 at
[2:49] this point we'll just go to verse 18 I
[2:52] believe but I I thought it was good that
[2:54] on Sunday brother Jason dears uh went to
[2:57] this scripture at some point so I think
[2:59] there's even a way that we could uh take
[3:02] some of those things that he said on a
[3:03] word family and the role of the
[3:05] patriarch and the nature of a patriarch
[3:08] even take that thought that he was on
[3:10] Sunday Kind of now look at this as a
[3:12] Place full of mercy and identify what
[3:15] would be the kind of characteristic of
[3:16] an Abraham today especially as we see
[3:19] Abraham here the father of Faith he's a
[3:21] patriarch and there's things about him
[3:23] in this scripture that we would admire
[3:25] and that we would say this is what a man
[3:26] should do in his home but we don't want
[3:28] to just uh we don't want to misinterpret
[3:30] the word of God and be a bro AB Broham
[3:32] we want to be Abraham right we want to
[3:35] be a real genuine patriarch so in
[3:37] Genesis 18:16 it says and the men rose
[3:40] up from then and looked toward Sodom and
[3:43] Abraham went with them to bring them on
[3:45] the way so now he's going to guide them
[3:48] a little bit to show them the way that
[3:49] they need to go but he's not going to go
[3:51] down into Sodom and then the scripture
[3:53] is able to give us insight into what God
[3:55] is thinking because it says and the Lord
[3:57] said shall I hide from Abraham that
[3:59] thing which I do seeing that Abraham
[4:02] shall surely become a great and mighty
[4:04] nation and all the nations of the Earth
[4:06] shall be blessed in him now he's given
[4:08] us some reasons why should I hide from
[4:11] Abraham what I'm going to do and he's
[4:13] given us some reasons why he shouldn't
[4:16] he says for I know him that he will
[4:18] command his children and his household
[4:20] after him and they shall keep the way of
[4:22] the Lord to do justice and judgment that
[4:24] the Lord may bring upon Abraham that
[4:26] which he ha spoken of him so God
[4:29] expressed expresses his desire to reveal
[4:32] his will to Abraham we we read he says
[4:34] shall I hide this thing from that I do
[4:36] from Abraham but in one way we could say
[4:38] he's saying should I reveal my will to
[4:41] Abraham so what he's wanting to do is
[4:43] give a revelation of the word revelation
[4:45] of future events he's wanting to
[4:47] disclose to him things and purposes and
[4:49] intents in his heart and when he's
[4:52] answering this question of should I do
[4:54] it should I reveal my word he answers in
[4:57] a rhetorical sense uh that yes I should
[5:00] because uh Abraham is going to be a
[5:02] great and mighty nation and the nations
[5:04] of the earth going to be blessed in him
[5:05] and he says for I know him and there's a
[5:07] certain character that God highlights
[5:10] and I'm wanting to zero in on these
[5:12] characteristics tonight still on the
[5:14] subject of mercy and a Place full of
[5:16] mercy and this is where I want to start
[5:18] to begin to bring this out further but
[5:20] he says that he's going to teach his
[5:22] children the way of the Lord he's going
[5:24] to teach him God's nature God's will
[5:26] God's character he's not just going to
[5:28] tell him factual things about God but
[5:30] he's going to teach them the way to keep
[5:33] the way of the Lord he's going to
[5:34] command his children and his household
[5:36] after him that they shall keep the way
[5:38] of the Lord so God will make known his
[5:41] will to Abraham he's going to reveal
[5:43] things to Abraham because Abraham would
[5:45] communicate it to those who need it
[5:48] catch this as even brother Jason was
[5:50] pointing out on Sunday how that here's a
[5:52] patriarch here's a father who's going to
[5:54] teach his children and teach his
[5:56] household but God was going to reveal
[5:58] this to Abraham because because Abraham
[6:00] would communicate divine revelation to
[6:02] his children and to his
[6:04] household and having this true knowledge
[6:07] he would teach he would instruct he
[6:08] would guide in that truth he wouldn't
[6:11] just kind of keep it to himself but he
[6:13] would say well having uh the word
[6:15] revealed to me I have responsibility to
[6:17] my children my immediate family and it
[6:19] wasn't just his immediate family but it
[6:21] was his household his servants and those
[6:23] uh that had come into his personal orbit
[6:25] that maybe worked for him and we might
[6:26] call them slaves or servants and these
[6:28] different things were joined to him he
[6:30] was going to teach them as well and this
[6:34] teaching your children becomes very
[6:37] demonstrative in the new Old Testament
[6:39] once the law is given Deuteronomy 6: 4-9
[6:42] here o Israel the Lord our God is one
[6:44] Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[6:46] God with all thine heart and with all
[6:48] thy soul and with all thy might and
[6:50] these words which I command thee this
[6:52] day shall be in thy heart now here is he
[6:55] says he will command his children his
[6:57] household after him so this is going to
[6:59] be a commandment given to Abraham it's
[7:01] going to be in his heart and then he's
[7:03] going to uh then teach his children and
[7:05] command them to keep the way of the Lord
[7:08] and he says and thou shalt teach them
[7:09] diligently unto thy children and shalt
[7:11] talk of them when thou sest in thine
[7:13] house when thou walst by the way and
[7:15] when thou liest down and when thy riseth
[7:16] up so in other words at all
[7:20] times till maybe seems to be some kind
[7:22] of archaic language or Old English but
[7:24] it's just a phrasing to suggest that
[7:26] it's always appropriate it's a good time
[7:29] to do do it and thou shalt bind them for
[7:31] a sign upon thy hand and they shall be
[7:33] as frontlets between thy eyes what is it
[7:35] talking about when you work what you
[7:37] what you do what you see what you think
[7:39] and thou shalt write them upon the post
[7:41] of thy house and on thy Gates why would
[7:44] these things that are being commanded to
[7:46] them this day why would they be taught
[7:48] why would they be taught diligently and
[7:50] why would they be always reminded of it
[7:52] because the goal was to keep the way of
[7:54] the Lord and so just as it was given in
[7:57] Deuteronomy it wasn't just that the word
[7:59] would be on these little things
[8:00] everywhere and they had these little
[8:02] things physically to remind them of the
[8:04] word but he really wanted it in their
[8:06] heart and so one way of imparting this
[8:08] knowledge is to teach and instruct and
[8:10] give children knowledge of the word of
[8:12] God this would be the a role of a father
[8:14] a patriarch within the home and God says
[8:17] he knows this about Abraham that if I
[8:19] reveal my will to him he will
[8:21] communicate my will to the children that
[8:23] they would keep the way of the Lord and
[8:25] the way of the Lord is described as
[8:27] doing Justice and judgment J I want to
[8:31] focus on those phrases Justice and
[8:33] judgment are the ways of the Lord I
[8:35] believe this is a real critical piece to
[8:37] God reveal in his word God wants to make
[8:39] his will known God wants to reveal his
[8:41] word to you wants to give you answers
[8:44] and there's a way that God wants you to
[8:46] handle that word once it's been revealed
[8:48] to you and so there are certain
[8:50] qualifications and certain
[8:51] characteristics that need to be molded
[8:53] in us for God to give us this Sovereign
[8:55] divine revelation of his perfect will
[8:58] and so just Justice in the scriptures
[9:00] it's used here to do justice it's often
[9:03] translated and very frequently
[9:04] translated to righteousness so it says
[9:06] to do righteousness or to do right to do
[9:08] justice and judgment and this Justice
[9:12] and judgment are unfailing Eternal
[9:14] attributes of God not just something
[9:17] that uh God stumbles on or oops look
[9:19] what I did there I judged but God is an
[9:21] eternal God who is a God of Justice and
[9:23] a god of judgment they're Eternal
[9:25] attributes of God Deuteronomy 32:4 says
[9:29] he is the rock his work is perfect for
[9:32] all his ways are judgment a god of Truth
[9:35] and without iniquity just and right is
[9:38] he this is uh describing Our God who is
[9:42] eternal Our God who is but one Lord all
[9:45] his ways are Justice and judgment all
[9:48] his way are true he's a god of Truth
[9:51] which is to be steadfast or faithful
[9:54] without iniquity that means without
[9:56] Injustice it means he's not wrong
[9:59] whatever ever God does is right so if
[10:02] God does something if we knew absolutely
[10:04] 100% God did something we should never
[10:06] ask well was that right it's always
[10:08] right if God speaks something we
[10:11] shouldn't say well I wonder if that's
[10:12] true if we absolutely know that God said
[10:14] something then it's truth amen if we
[10:17] absolutely know God did something then
[10:19] it's right now we can wrestle with our
[10:22] own sense of um righteousness and our
[10:25] own sense of correctness but if it's God
[10:27] whatever he says is true whatever he
[10:29] does is just these are just attributes
[10:31] specifically to God Alone he is a god of
[10:34] Truth and without iniquity he has no
[10:37] Injustice as Paul says in Romans chapter
[10:39] 9: 13-6 as it is written Jacob have I
[10:42] loved but Esau have I hated now that
[10:46] Paul anticipates the objection wait a
[10:48] minute God loves one and hates the other
[10:50] what shall we say then is there
[10:52] unrighteousness with God is there
[10:54] Injustice with God Justice is
[10:57] righteousness this unrighteousness would
[10:59] be unfairness or inequitable uh he's is
[11:02] he is he injust is this an injustice
[11:05] that God would want love one in not love
[11:07] the other actually just hate the other
[11:09] he says God forbid in other words God is
[11:11] Not unjust for he saith to Moses and I
[11:14] don't know that this helps uh he say
[11:16] well no God's Fair he'll hate who he
[11:18] wants and loves who he
[11:21] wants but it is it's exactly what he's
[11:23] saying he said I will have mercy on whom
[11:26] I will have mercy and I will have
[11:27] compassion on whom I will have comp
[11:29] compassion is God unjust
[11:31] no but he is merciful on those he will
[11:34] have mercy and he has compassion on
[11:36] Those whom he will have compassion so
[11:38] then it is not of him that willth nor of
[11:39] him that runneth but of God that showeth
[11:43] Mercy Paul doesn't back away from it he
[11:45] just continues to lean into it and says
[11:47] that God loves one and hates the other
[11:49] we say well that's not fair that's not
[11:51] just and he goes through it in more
[11:52] detail in Romans 9 well shall the clay
[11:54] say to the the one that formed it uh
[11:56] that's not right and so he's really
[11:59] dealing with some very weighty things
[12:01] things that could cause a paradox things
[12:02] that cause people to wrestle but the
[12:04] Bible says just and right is he just
[12:07] means he's right he's correct he's
[12:09] lawful he's righteous just and right
[12:12] that means straight he's correct it's
[12:14] proper proper it's level this is what
[12:17] God is he's just and right he's a rock
[12:19] his work is perfect all his ways are
[12:22] judgment really focusing on this
[12:25] characteristic that Abraham was going to
[12:27] teach his children to do Justice and
[12:30] judgment we really need to understand
[12:32] these phrases this characteristic that
[12:34] Abraham is going to have he's going to
[12:36] teach his
[12:37] children and Joseph Addison how many
[12:40] read The Works of Joseph Addison did you
[12:42] ever read the guardian in
[12:44] 17113 no okay on issue number nine on
[12:48] July 4th 1713 in the guardian Joseph
[12:50] Addison wrote there is no virtue so
[12:52] truly great and Godlike as
[12:55] Justice most of the other virtues are
[12:57] virtues of created being or accommodated
[13:00] to our nature as we are men Justice is
[13:03] that which is practiced by God himself
[13:06] and to be practiced in its Perfection by
[13:08] none but him omniscience and omnipotence
[13:11] are required for the full execution of
[13:13] it I had to uh type this up reading the
[13:17] old English font and spelling and
[13:19] everything so if I got something wrong
[13:20] it's because I don't know what
[13:22] omnipotence is and I assumed it was
[13:24] omniscience omniscience and omnipotence
[13:27] are required for the full execution of
[13:28] it the one omniscience to discover every
[13:31] degree of uprightness or iniquity in
[13:33] thoughts words and actions it's powerful
[13:36] the other which would be his omnipotence
[13:38] to measure out and inflict suitable
[13:40] rewards and punishments as to be
[13:43] perfectly just is an attribute in the
[13:45] divine nature to be so to the utmost of
[13:47] our ability is the glory of a
[13:50] man I like that you may not like Joseph
[13:53] Addison the Brit that he was but in
[13:56] reading this to me it is so true there's
[13:58] no virtue so truly great and Godlike as
[14:02] Justice and this Justice is something
[14:04] that could only be perfectly executed by
[14:06] God himself and that in this he is all
[14:09] knowing so that he can know thoughts and
[14:11] actions and words and deeds and thoughts
[14:13] and intents and then he could have the
[14:15] power to judge it or reward it
[14:17] appropriately and he said it's part of
[14:19] the divine nature and then this fact
[14:21] that the glory of man would be to strive
[14:24] to our utmost ability to do the same
[14:27] that is the glory of a man right is to
[14:30] to search and to strive for
[14:33] justice and this speaks to the
[14:35] importance of justice and even want to
[14:36] begin to look at the scriptures well
[14:38] then what is Justice if this is
[14:40] something that is attributable to God
[14:41] it's something that only God himself can
[14:43] be practiced by only God himself can
[14:46] practice it perfectly in Isaiah 59:14
[14:50] and judgment is turned away backward
[14:52] there's a lot more in this chapter I
[14:54] wanted to explore but for time sake
[14:56] we'll just take this verse out of out of
[14:58] this reading and judgment is turned away
[15:00] backward and Justice standeth a far off
[15:03] for truth is fallen in the street and
[15:06] Equity cannot enter what a beautiful uh
[15:08] picture that's painted with these words
[15:11] that judgment has been turned aside and
[15:13] Justice is kind of lingering far off
[15:16] because truth is
[15:18] Fallen since truth is not being upheld
[15:20] and since truth does not have a place uh
[15:23] and Equity cannot enter you cannot have
[15:25] Justice or judgment so one thing I want
[15:28] you to see and I don't have time maybe
[15:30] to explore in great detail tonight but
[15:33] Justice is truth in action you can't
[15:37] just think about something and well I I
[15:39] think you're right and if anything being
[15:41] a parent has really taught me this that
[15:43] just acknowledging that one is right or
[15:45] acknowledging that one has been wronged
[15:47] really isn't enough for fairness right
[15:50] you've got to kick that kid out of the
[15:52] house who took this from me and he
[15:54] should no longer exist whatsoever
[15:56] forever more dad do something about it
[15:59] are you going to do something about it
[16:01] why because Justice is truth in
[16:04] action and one thing I want you to catch
[16:08] very quickly is Justice and Truth are
[16:10] connected you cannot have Justice
[16:13] without truth and I know you're thinking
[16:15] no justice no peace but no truth no
[16:19] justice let's add that to our protest
[16:23] signs that without truth you cannot have
[16:27] Justice amen and if you were to uh
[16:30] destroy the truth and uh tear down the
[16:33] truth or lie you can't get Justice you
[16:36] can lie say well he did it he did it
[16:37] this is what happened and get all the
[16:39] facts together and then you judge on the
[16:40] basis of those facts and then find out
[16:42] that those were lies justice has not
[16:45] been done so Justice and Truth are work
[16:49] together they cannot be separated Psalms
[16:51] 33:4 for the word of the Lord is right
[16:53] and all his works are done in truth all
[16:57] his ways are perfect his work work is
[16:59] perfect all his ways are Justice and the
[17:00] god of Truth and without iniquity just
[17:03] and right is he his works are done in
[17:05] truth justice itself means to be right
[17:09] to be fair to be just is to be right and
[17:12] correct so Justice is to be just to be
[17:14] justce to be right and correct and
[17:17] really maybe the word that we're
[17:18] describing for us is when something is
[17:21] fair it's that uh that quality of being
[17:24] free from favoritism or bias it
[17:27] disqualifies all of us
[17:29] we just have some inherent bias all it
[17:32] takes is I mean just just go to a
[17:34] baseball game a and then they're going
[17:36] to put up on the screen a DOT race
[17:39] you're going have to choose between red
[17:40] yellow and blue and guess what and green
[17:42] and all of a sudden you're going to have
[17:43] a color you like and you're going to
[17:45] want that color to win for no particular
[17:47] reason but they just and then they do it
[17:49] with you know frankfurters and hot dogs
[17:51] and what do we have here presidents is
[17:52] it presidents that race here no that's
[17:55] in that's in Washington what is it that
[17:56] races here come on sport sports
[17:59] fans what we don't have a we don't have
[18:03] a a race in Tex or here in Arizona my
[18:06] goodness we need to give some to the Bob
[18:08] the bank one ballpark not even called
[18:10] that anymore Chase Field we need some
[18:13] games but there's a this idea of being
[18:16] impartial that would be something that
[18:18] is fair it's impartial it's just to all
[18:21] parties it's Equitable you don't just
[18:23] pick something for some reason and
[18:25] you're going to say well no matter what
[18:26] this is right and and pick sides that's
[18:29] why it's Addison himself that makes the
[18:30] comment Justice discards party
[18:33] friendship Kindred and therefore always
[18:35] is represented as
[18:38] Blind Justice is blind in what sense
[18:40] that it doesn't know truth no in the
[18:42] sense that it will not favor party
[18:44] friendship Kindred it's blind because it
[18:47] will only go by knowledge and truth it
[18:50] won't just pick up favorites or have a
[18:52] bias or or be prejudiced towards
[18:54] something and God is a God of Justice
[18:59] Justice and Truth are connected together
[19:02] and just as you cannot have Justice or
[19:04] judgment without truth the same goes for
[19:07] Mercy this is me just trying to gather
[19:09] some of these things within our views so
[19:10] we can compare them together in Proverbs
[19:13] 14:22 do they not Heir that devise evil
[19:18] but mercy and truth shall be to them
[19:20] that devise good so here's those that
[19:23] devise evil certainly there's going to
[19:25] be punishment but mercy and truth shall
[19:28] be to them that devise good this Mercy
[19:31] then is somehow joined with the truth
[19:33] that they are doing good the reality
[19:35] that they're doing good so mercy and
[19:37] Truth are to them in Psalms 2510 we've
[19:40] already read that the ways of the Lord
[19:41] are right they are just they are true
[19:43] all the paths of the Lord are mercy and
[19:45] Truth unto such as keep his Covenant and
[19:48] his testimonies so now it's mercy and
[19:51] Truth are the paths of the Lord then
[19:53] Proverbs 16 I encourage you maybe to go
[19:55] and read that in total there's a lot on
[19:57] this very subject the entire chapter by
[19:59] Mercy and Truth is Iniquity purged and
[20:02] by the fear of the Lord men depart from
[20:04] evil evil how is Iniquity purged not
[20:07] just by truth but Mercy amen by Mercy
[20:09] and Truth iniquity is purged these are
[20:13] things I want you to see that they we
[20:14] have Justice and truth that are
[20:15] connected and now we have mercy
[20:17] connected with truth so we can see Truth
[20:19] at the middle Truth at the heart the
[20:21] word of God at the heart in Justice is
[20:23] connected with the word and and and
[20:25] mercy is connected with the word in
[20:28] psalm 85 it says Lord thou H has been
[20:30] favorable into thy land thou Hast
[20:32] brought back the Captivity of Jacob thou
[20:35] has forgiven the iniquity of thy people
[20:37] thou has covered all their sins say law
[20:39] thou has taken away all thy wrath thou
[20:41] has turned thyself from the fierceness
[20:43] of thy anger turn us oh god of our
[20:45] salvation and cause thine anger toward
[20:47] us to cease wil thou be angry with us
[20:50] forever and all the children said
[20:53] amen wilt thou draw out thine anger to
[20:56] all generations and I love this will sh
[20:58] thou not revive us again something to
[21:02] this request and this cry that thy
[21:05] people may rejoice in thee show us thy
[21:08] mercy oh Lord and grant us thy salvation
[21:12] I will hear what the Lord what God the
[21:14] Lord will speak for he will speak peace
[21:16] unto his people and to his Saints but
[21:18] let them not turn again to Folly surely
[21:20] his salvation is nigh them that fear him
[21:23] that the glory May dwell That Glory May
[21:25] dwell in our land now notice this
[21:27] Proclamation Mercy and Truth are met
[21:30] together are you going to be angry with
[21:32] us forever are you going to revive us
[21:34] are you going to is your will your anger
[21:36] ever subside he says mercy and Truth are
[21:39] met together show us Mercy where are we
[21:41] going to get this Mercy when truth comes
[21:44] mercy and Truth are met together
[21:46] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[21:48] other what does this speak of the
[21:50] Messiah amen that in the Messiah who is
[21:53] the way the truth the life in him was
[21:55] found not only truth but Mercy in that
[21:58] truth
[21:59] and where mercy and Truth are met
[22:00] together verse 11 truth shall spring out
[22:02] of the earth and righteousness shall
[22:04] look down from heaven yay the Lord shall
[22:06] give that which is good and our land
[22:08] shall yield her Increase righteousness
[22:10] shall go before him here's the Messiah
[22:12] righteousness shall go before him and
[22:13] Shall Set us in the way of his steps
[22:17] it's the very thing that we see pattern
[22:19] and Abraham who would teach his children
[22:21] to keep the Commandments of the Lord and
[22:23] to keep the way of the Lord and that way
[22:27] is to do justce Justice and
[22:33] judgment the Bible says in 1st
[22:35] Chronicles chapter
[22:37] 16:34 I'm going I'm going over this
[22:39] quickly I know but I just want you to
[22:41] see these scriptures mercy and Truth are
[22:43] met together in Christ there is truth in
[22:47] Christ there is Mercy 1st Chronicles
[22:50] 16:34 and you'll find this passage
[22:52] related in the in in other places in
[22:54] Psalm this very exact scenario oh give
[22:57] thanks unto the Lord for his good for
[22:59] his mercy endureth
[23:01] forever 41 times in the Bible is this
[23:05] phrase written his mercy endureth
[23:09] forever that's that's that reputation is
[23:11] for a reason something that is repeated
[23:14] more often than anything else almost for
[23:17] his mercy endureth forever I didn't do a
[23:18] search to compare it to others you can
[23:20] have chat GPT do it later but for his
[23:23] mercy endureth forever 41 times it is
[23:26] said there's some enduring quality about
[23:29] mercy and his Mercy enduring forever
[23:32] notice what it says about his Justice
[23:33] Psalms 111:3 his work is Honorable and
[23:36] glorious and his righteousness endureth
[23:38] forever that righteousness there is the
[23:41] same word justice in in Genesis Genesis
[23:44] 11942 the righteousness is an
[23:47] everlasting righteousness thy
[23:49] righteousness is an everlasting
[23:50] righteousness in thy law is the truth
[23:54] Psalms 117: 1 and 2 Oh Praise the Lord
[23:56] all you Nations praise him all you
[23:58] people people for his merciful kindness
[24:00] is great towards us and the truth of the
[24:03] Lord endureth forever praise ye the Lord
[24:06] his word shall never fail his word shall
[24:08] never pass away his word is enduring and
[24:11] in his word is Justice and judgment in
[24:14] his word is Mercy for his righteousness
[24:17] endureth forever his mercy endureth
[24:19] forever Psalms 1191 16 Thy word is true
[24:23] from the beginning in every one of thy
[24:26] righteous judgments endureth
[24:30] forever these are the qualities of
[24:32] justice and judgment they endure
[24:35] forever wanting you to see this that God
[24:37] is
[24:38] merciful that God is a god of compassion
[24:42] God is a god of Mercy is full of Mercy
[24:44] he's also a God of Justice and
[24:47] judgment and Justice and Truth go
[24:50] together you have truth it's married
[24:53] with Justice and you cannot separate it
[24:55] but then there's this other facet of it
[24:57] where there's also Mercy that's joined
[24:59] to it as well mercy and Truth are met
[25:03] together and in Psalms 89:14 it says
[25:07] justice and judgment are the habitation
[25:09] of thy Throne mercy and Truth Shall go
[25:13] before thy face these aren't competing
[25:15] with each other say well I mean Justice
[25:17] and judgment are the habitation of his
[25:19] throne but mercy and truth will go
[25:21] before thy face these are to these work
[25:25] together these things how unjust would
[25:29] Justice be without truth right how
[25:32] unfair would judgment be and unequitable
[25:34] and how not judgment would it be without
[25:38] truth but Justice and judgment are the
[25:40] habitation of thy Throne this is how a
[25:43] throne ought to be established in
[25:44] righteousness and uprightness and
[25:46] integrity and mercy and Truth Shall go
[25:48] before thy face these are the very
[25:51] things that Abraham would follow the
[25:53] very things that would be revealed to
[25:55] Abraham and it's the very things that
[25:56] Abraham would teach his children and his
[25:59] household Justice and
[26:01] judgment I know we're not spending a lot
[26:03] of time on judgment but judgment in the
[26:06] this word that's used in Genesis the act
[26:07] of deciding or it's a place of decision
[26:11] the place or the court or the seat of
[26:14] judgment together if you say justice and
[26:17] judgment it's this phrase that gives
[26:19] rise to this image of one who is in the
[26:22] place of deciding something gives us
[26:25] image of a judge or a king or or a
[26:27] leader
[26:30] and this Justice that's being spoken of
[26:32] to teach he would teach his
[26:34] children and even this Justice that
[26:37] we're commanded to have in scripture
[26:38] maybe we'll find more of these instances
[26:40] later but it's to do that which is right
[26:42] between man and man that if there's
[26:45] going to be Justice if we're going to uh
[26:48] teach Justice and we're going to be just
[26:50] and right we're going to do that which
[26:51] is right between man and man it speaks
[26:53] of
[26:54] truthfulness so you can't have Justice
[26:56] without truth you cannot have mercy
[27:00] without
[27:02] truth says of David 2 Samuel verse
[27:05] chapter 8 verse 15 you can find this a
[27:07] few places and David reigned over all
[27:09] Israel and David executed judgment and
[27:12] Justice unto all his people this is his
[27:15] authority as king they weren't ruled by
[27:17] a judge he became the king he's the one
[27:19] that would dispense Justice he's the one
[27:21] that could decide he's the one that
[27:23] would make decisions and then of Solomon
[27:26] whom we know to be the wisest in all the
[27:27] world in First Kings 10:9 believe this
[27:30] is Shea even speaking this blessed be
[27:31] the Lord thy God which delighteth in
[27:33] thee to set thee on the throne of Israel
[27:35] because the Lord loved Israel forever
[27:38] therefore made he thee King to do
[27:40] judgment and
[27:42] Justice these are the habitation of a
[27:46] throne these ought to be the habitations
[27:49] of a judge could you imagine if you're
[27:51] going to see you someone files a court
[27:54] case and it gets served to you and a a
[27:56] and you're going to find someone who
[27:57] going to be uh the captain of chaos and
[28:01] that's who you have to appear before
[28:03] wait a minute they're suing me in small
[28:04] claims court and he's called the captain
[28:06] of chaos he'd be a little bit nervous
[28:08] but he's actually called Justice of the
[28:11] Peace why because it's to convey some
[28:15] qualification and some that what you
[28:17] would want You' expect I mean if you're
[28:18] low down dirty rotten uh fraud you don't
[28:20] really want to go get Justice you don't
[28:22] want to get judgment you'd love to know
[28:24] Captain Chaos is up there so that he can
[28:26] make a mistake and maybe vindicate you
[28:27] but when we are in these courts when
[28:29] we're in these situations we want
[28:31] Integrity we want truth we want
[28:34] righteousness Justice and
[28:36] judgment is how this Throne is
[28:38] established these are the the nature and
[28:40] qualification of a king of a judge and
[28:43] then it said of the Messiah in Isaiah
[28:45] chapter 9: 6 and 7 For unto us a child
[28:48] is born unto us a son is given and the
[28:51] government shall be upon his shoulder
[28:53] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[28:55] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[28:58] father the Prince of Peace these are the
[29:00] this is what he will be called of the
[29:02] increase of his government in peace
[29:04] there shall be no end upon the throne of
[29:07] David and upon his kingdom to order it
[29:09] and to establish it with judgment and
[29:12] with Justice from hence forth even
[29:15] forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts
[29:17] will perform this the Messiah is going
[29:21] to establish his kingdom with judgment
[29:23] and with Justice even forever more these
[29:27] are the marks and characteristics of a
[29:29] righteous king of a righteous
[29:31] judge these are the the the qualities of
[29:34] God who judges
[29:37] correctly I want this to be I know that
[29:41] in in my studying this there's so many
[29:43] more I find myself just page after page
[29:45] after page of scriptures on these
[29:48] characteristics of God and Justice and
[29:49] judgment and I've even left out the
[29:52] Judgment part these are just things that
[29:54] come in View and we begin to look at
[29:56] Justice that Justice is truth in action
[29:59] it is his character and quality of God
[30:01] who himself is true he's one that is
[30:04] true he's the he is the word the word
[30:07] from the beginning and the word from the
[30:09] beginning was true and every one of his
[30:12] uh judgments are
[30:14] righteous and his Justice endureth
[30:18] forever because in truth there's
[30:21] justice but in that same truth there's
[30:23] also Mercy these things are working
[30:25] together they're they're part to each
[30:27] other and it's in this Messiah that we
[30:29] see that mercy and Truth are met
[30:31] together that in this Messiah there's
[30:33] judgment and Justice can you just see
[30:35] these things they don't have to
[30:36] necessarily all fit fit right now but
[30:38] can you just kind of see them floating
[30:39] into view these things are there you
[30:41] could wrestle them out you can uh pray
[30:43] to have God just piece these things
[30:45] together but let's go back to this
[30:47] conversation or this scene with
[30:50] Abraham the men rose up to go into
[30:54] Sodom and they had obviously beforehand
[30:56] been commanded to go and this was part
[30:59] of the mission and part of the plan and
[31:00] then as they get up to go and Abraham's
[31:03] kind of sauntering with them God
[31:05] discloses something that's in his heart
[31:07] or at least something that's in his will
[31:08] as he's expressing this and he says
[31:12] shall I hide from him what I'm going to
[31:16] do and a phrase that he uses in verse 19
[31:19] is for I know
[31:21] him what was it that God saw on Abraham
[31:25] he says I know him and I'll just mention
[31:27] a few things brother bradam said he
[31:29] constantly made mistakes he doubted God
[31:31] he lied about his wife there's things
[31:33] that Abraham did where you could see
[31:35] that there was this pattern of fear and
[31:37] doubt there a pattern of even being
[31:39] carnal that there was a pattern where
[31:41] Abraham maybe to this point hadn't
[31:43] really uh yielded completely and hadn't
[31:46] fully caught the Revelation and a
[31:49] Abraham was making had made these
[31:50] mistakes but God says I know him and
[31:54] when he said he knew him it wasn't that
[31:55] he knew his past he knew his history he
[31:58] knew the Optics and the the veneer of
[32:00] Abraham but he knew his heart in Psalms
[32:03] 4 44: 21 shall not God search this out
[32:06] for he knoweth the secrets of the
[32:09] heart
[32:12] Abraham God knew Abraham's
[32:14] heart so he knew that not only as the
[32:18] scripture says he would teach his
[32:20] children his household but what what it
[32:22] assumes in that is he could also be
[32:23] taught right there was something about
[32:26] Abraham's heart that I can show him my
[32:28] will and when I show him my will he'll
[32:30] be receptive to it he can receive it his
[32:33] heart can be molded by this Revelation
[32:35] and having been molded and set right by
[32:37] this Revelation he's then going to teach
[32:39] this
[32:40] himself because God knows the secrets of
[32:42] the heart God knew the heart of Abraham
[32:47] I was going to use this passage in
[32:48] Proverbs 3 as my text verses 3 and four
[32:51] and that I just kind of struggled just
[32:52] where to put this but it says let not
[32:54] mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them
[32:57] about thy neck write them upon the table
[32:59] of thine heart so shalt thou find favor
[33:02] and good understanding in the sight of
[33:04] God and man Abraham believed God and it
[33:07] was accounted to him for righteousness
[33:09] and he was called a friend of God
[33:11] something about Abraham's nature and
[33:13] disposition something is expressed in
[33:15] Abraham's life yes he believed God he's
[33:17] the patriarch of Faith but when he had
[33:20] when he heard these things from God he
[33:22] would bind them about his neck he would
[33:24] write them upon the table of his heart
[33:27] and the command is let not mercy and
[33:30] Truth forsake Thee I know we want to say
[33:33] well he's a god of Truth he's a the word
[33:35] the word the word the word only and
[33:36] there's a lot of things that we like to
[33:37] say and a lot of mantras that we might
[33:39] have but it's not saying just let Truth
[33:42] uh uh let not Truth for safety but it's
[33:44] also kind of giving this as the lead in
[33:46] let not Mercy In Truth for safety don't
[33:49] just bind the truth about thy neck and
[33:51] write it upon the table of th heart but
[33:53] let mercy be there
[33:55] also if this happens and you'll find
[33:58] favor with
[34:00] man you'll find good understanding in
[34:03] the sight of man and in the sight of
[34:07] God God would reveal truth to Abraham
[34:11] God would reveal Mercy to
[34:13] Abraham and God knew that Abraham would
[34:15] fill up his heart with it not just with
[34:18] truth but
[34:20] Mercy he knew there was something in
[34:23] Abraham what he saw in Abraham I know
[34:25] maybe there's just kind of peeking open
[34:27] the door a little bit bit in that which
[34:28] says I know him well what did he know
[34:31] about
[34:32] him for I know
[34:35] him that he will command his children
[34:37] his household after him you know that
[34:40] shows shows more concern than just for
[34:45] himself he knew something about the
[34:47] heart of
[34:49] Abraham for I know him and that he will
[34:52] command his children and his household
[34:53] after him and they shall keep the way of
[34:56] the Lord to do justice and judgment that
[34:57] the Lord may bring upon Abraham that
[34:59] which he hath spoken of him and in verse
[35:02] 20 so go forward here making really
[35:05] really good
[35:06] time we could beat the crowds to In and
[35:09] Out Genesis 18: 20 21 and
[35:13] 22 and the Lord
[35:15] said now kind of catch what's happening
[35:19] here he says shall I hide this thing
[35:21] from Abraham so what he says next is
[35:23] this is God revealing something to
[35:25] Abraham because the Cry of Sodom and
[35:27] gomor is great because their sin is very
[35:29] Grievous I will go down now and see
[35:33] whether they have done Al together
[35:34] according to the Cry of it which has
[35:35] come unto me and if not I will know no
[35:39] not now I want you to think of this this
[35:41] phrase that God speaks to Abraham is
[35:45] part of him disclosing his will to
[35:47] Abraham and as we'll see Abraham catches
[35:49] a revelation of what's being said he
[35:51] catches a revelation of something about
[35:53] the nature and character of God and the
[35:56] men turn their faces from th and and
[35:57] went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet
[36:00] before the
[36:01] Lord God tells Abraham that he will see
[36:04] if Sodom and Gomorrah deserve the
[36:07] Judgment what a remarkable statement he
[36:09] goes I'm going to go down he's going to
[36:11] go down in the person of these two
[36:13] witnesses and he's going to see whether
[36:16] the cry that he has heard of this
[36:18] wickedness and this unlawfulness and
[36:20] this perversion he's going to see
[36:22] whether or not it is so cuz he says once
[36:24] he sees he will know in other words God
[36:26] is going to examine first or in this
[36:29] action that this their their conduct and
[36:32] their behavior is deserving of judgment
[36:33] but he's going to come first yeah and
[36:37] see and he says if not I will
[36:40] know so there's something revealed in
[36:42] this remember in Luke chapter 17 veres
[36:45] 28 to3 likewise also as it was in the
[36:47] days of lot they did eat they drank they
[36:49] bought they sold they planted they
[36:51] builded and these are the cries that
[36:53] come up before God and he says I'm going
[36:54] to go down and I'm going to visit
[36:55] they're eating they're drinking they're
[36:56] buying they're selling planting the
[36:58] building and I'm going to see what's in
[37:01] it but the same day that lot went out of
[37:03] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[37:05] heaven and destroyed them all here's
[37:06] your judgment even thus shall it be in
[37:09] the day when the son of man is revealed
[37:12] right these events of Genesis 18 are
[37:14] very important to us in the age of the
[37:16] son of man revealing himself in this
[37:18] dispensation of judgment and
[37:21] Truth he says I will go down now and see
[37:25] if they're doing evil and if not I will
[37:27] know
[37:29] and as soon as God says this he tells us
[37:32] that the men turned and went down toward
[37:34] Sodom but Abraham stays with the Lord he
[37:38] stood yet before the Lord and what I
[37:40] want you to see is that immediately
[37:41] Abraham demonstrates what God knew about
[37:45] Abraham he says I know Abraham so I'm
[37:48] going to tell Abraham what I'm going to
[37:50] do and I know Abraham is going to be of
[37:53] a certain character and disposition and
[37:55] he immediately demonstrates what God on
[37:57] his heart from Proverbs 21: 1:3 the
[38:01] king's heart is the hand of the Lord as
[38:03] the rivers of water he turneth it
[38:05] withersoever he will every way of man is
[38:08] right in his own eyes but the Lord pth
[38:11] the hearts to do justice and judgment is
[38:15] more acceptable to the Lord than
[38:18] sacrifice now remember how to obey is
[38:21] better than sacrifice that stubbornness
[38:23] and and Rebellion is as a sin of
[38:25] Witchcraft and so there's certain itics
[38:27] and certain things enforced uh taking
[38:30] away our liberties and these iniquities
[38:32] and rebellions and these things that
[38:34] we've seen in the word to this point and
[38:35] how to obey is better than sacrifice
[38:38] something that Saul just couldn't quite
[38:40] get and here he's saying Justice and
[38:41] judgment are more acceptable to the Lord
[38:43] than sacrifice all the religious
[38:46] pretense all the things we could put out
[38:48] front Oh Lord You're awesome Oh Lord
[38:49] You're great there's only one God you're
[38:51] great you're wonderful and he's saying
[38:52] well you could do all these things but
[38:54] neglect the weightier matters of the law
[38:56] like truth and Justice and mercy good to
[39:00] do justice to do right and to judge is
[39:03] more acceptable to the Lord than
[39:06] sacrifice this is what would please God
[39:08] this is what God wants to see Abraham
[39:10] was one who continually offered Abraham
[39:13] had even served him at the tent door
[39:14] Abraham was one of a life of service and
[39:17] and these different things but now in
[39:18] this great moment he says will I hide
[39:20] from Abraham that which I want to
[39:22] do and he goes no I won't I'll tell him
[39:25] exactly what I'm do going to do because
[39:27] I know
[39:29] him that he will do
[39:31] justice and
[39:33] judgment so notice this and the men
[39:35] turned their faces from th and went
[39:37] toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet
[39:39] before the Lord and Abraham Drew near
[39:43] and said wilt thou also destroy the
[39:45] righteous with the
[39:47] Wicked This is what he he catches we
[39:50] read says well God's just going to go
[39:51] down and see whether or not the cry is
[39:54] right I'm going to go down and see if
[39:56] they're being Wicked I'm going to go
[39:57] down see if they're being unrighteous I
[39:59] want to see and if they're not I'll know
[40:00] and Abraham catches the Revelation he
[40:03] sees Into the Heart of God and knows
[40:05] that he wouldn't just not be going down
[40:06] there to witness uh frivolity he
[40:09] wouldn't just be going to witness
[40:10] perversion that there would be a
[40:11] consequence if God was sending a a
[40:15] witness and he says will you destroy the
[40:18] righteous with the wicked I want you to
[40:20] catch this as at the heart of this
[40:22] patriarch this one who was going to be
[40:24] safe from the Judgment this one who had
[40:26] already received enough word to know
[40:28] that I will visit you according to the
[40:30] time of life and I will come and I will
[40:32] visit you and Sarah shall have a son and
[40:34] he knows there's judgment coming into
[40:35] the valley there's judgment coming to
[40:37] lot or to Sodom and Gomorrah and he's
[40:39] not worried about himself he knows he's
[40:41] safe with the Lord he's there under a
[40:43] promise but now he says will you destroy
[40:45] the righteous with the wicked I notice
[40:48] what he says per Adventure there be 50
[40:50] righteous within the city wil thou also
[40:52] destroy and not spare the place for the
[40:54] 50 righteous that are therein this is
[40:57] quite a statement from
[40:59] Abraham and notice he says that be far
[41:01] from thee so amazing that be far from
[41:05] thee to do after this manner to slay the
[41:08] righteous with the wicked you'll find
[41:10] that in the scripture judgment is often
[41:12] translated to manner after this manner
[41:14] this be far from thee to do after this
[41:16] kind of judgment this is far from your
[41:18] judgment to slay righteous with the
[41:21] wicked you're not this kind of God this
[41:24] isn't the kind of God that you are and
[41:26] that the righteous should be as the
[41:27] wicked that be far from
[41:30] thee wow this is reminds me of Moses
[41:33] standing in the Gap this reminds me of
[41:35] one who is responding back to God not in
[41:37] a way to rebuke God but in a way of
[41:39] reminding God something about him
[41:41] something that Abraham had learned about
[41:44] God
[41:45] Amen the the righteous uh be as the
[41:49] wicked that be far from thee shall not
[41:51] the judge of all the Earth do
[41:56] right th not the judge of all the Earth
[41:59] do
[42:00] justice I don't know if it says this in
[42:02] your
[42:04] Bible it doesn't say it in mine but I
[42:07] think this would be a fair heading
[42:09] Abraham intercedes before God God has
[42:13] said he's visited Abraham he's revealed
[42:15] himself to Abraham Abraham is there
[42:17] under a promise you know the promised
[42:18] son is soon coming he can sit there in
[42:20] rest knowing that through Sarah is going
[42:22] the seed is going to be but now God says
[42:24] I'm going to bring judgment upon Sodom
[42:26] and gomorra and Abraham intercedes
[42:28] before
[42:29] God he appeals to God's character amen
[42:33] he doesn't object and say well you're un
[42:35] righteous he says you're a righteous God
[42:37] he's not saying that's unfair he just
[42:39] begins to remind God of his own
[42:41] character as a righteous judge he's
[42:43] saying you would not punish them without
[42:45] first warning them he would not punish
[42:48] them without first giving them the truth
[42:51] and and cultivating and calling out and
[42:53] identifying the righteous Abraham saying
[42:55] I know it looks awful I know it looks
[42:57] ugly but God could you not go down and
[43:01] find and identify righteous
[43:05] people and Abraham responded to God
[43:08] according to his God's revealed will and
[43:10] character
[43:12] right he interceded you know what he was
[43:15] doing he was an intercessor he's
[43:17] mediating he's interceding showing the
[43:19] mercy of God which endures
[43:23] forever and he demonstrates God's
[43:25] justice and judgment by appealing for
[43:28] salvation in a time of
[43:31] judgment he said God I I know you're a
[43:33] just God you're a
[43:35] judge of all the
[43:37] Earth and can you shall not the judge of
[43:40] all the Earth do justice so he's
[43:42] appealing what if there's 50 righteous
[43:44] in the city what what would and this is
[43:47] him you know what notice this too he's
[43:49] not just arguing for
[43:51] lot he's arguing for the righteous in
[43:53] the
[43:54] city he he's pleading on behalf of those
[43:57] unknown to him he doesn't say and it's
[44:00] it's not here in the Bible as we read it
[44:03] here it doesn't say that Abraham oh but
[44:05] what about lot my nephew and his family
[44:07] and and these and all that they might be
[44:09] associated with and their friends and
[44:10] their neighbors he doesn't say that but
[44:13] when it comes time this is this is not
[44:16] in the in the interceding of Abraham in
[44:18] the scripture but when God does rescue
[44:20] lot as we read later you'll find that it
[44:22] says and because of Abraham God rescued
[44:25] lot and it says he showed of mercy and
[44:28] he was merciful to him and it was
[44:31] because of Abraham why I imagine that it
[44:33] must have been in there too that go that
[44:35] go Abraham be to intercede for
[44:38] lot says I know he chose that place I
[44:40] know he went down there I know he
[44:42] doesn't believe all the way but yet
[44:44] there was something in Abraham that
[44:46] although he had truth although he had uh
[44:48] this mezic relationship although he had
[44:50] this Elohim being revealed to him he
[44:53] didn't just become all Justice and wrath
[44:55] and judgment but there was a character
[44:57] of God in his heart to say wait Lord
[45:00] what about anybody could there be
[45:02] anybody else that can be
[45:05] saved and notice how Abraham now begins
[45:08] to demonstrate this Justice and
[45:10] judgment and so the Lord says in verse
[45:13] 26 if I find in Sodom 50 righteous
[45:16] within within the city then I will spare
[45:19] all the place for their
[45:21] sakes and Abraham answered and said
[45:24] notice this real it's a boldness but yet
[45:26] it's
[45:27] behold now I have taken upon me to speak
[45:29] unto the Lord which am but dust and
[45:32] Ashes and he's acknowledging his
[45:34] smallness before God and then he begins
[45:37] he he doesn't say
[45:39] okay that if there's 50 you'll spare it
[45:42] okay notice what he begins to say he he
[45:44] pushes it further per Adventure there
[45:46] shall lack five of the 50 righteous will
[45:48] th destroy all the city for lack of
[45:51] five notice how he's he's still
[45:54] compelled he's still uh uh not
[45:57] bargaining but pleading with God God
[46:00] says okay if I find 50 I I won't destroy
[46:02] them all he says well what about
[46:04] 45 and he says and he said if I find
[46:08] there 45 I will not destroy it so God
[46:10] says okay Abraham and I think God's
[46:12] liking this God likes this this Instinct
[46:15] in Abraham this is somebody that he
[46:17] could see in Abraham this is the kind of
[46:20] quality I want in my chosen this is the
[46:22] kind of quality I want in my elect and
[46:24] Abraham's and he spake unto him yet
[46:26] again and said per Adventure there shall
[46:27] be 40 found there and he said I will not
[46:30] do it for 40 sake and he said and all
[46:32] let not the Lord be angry and I will
[46:34] speak per Adventure there shall be 30
[46:37] there shall 30 be found there and he
[46:38] said I will not do it if I find 30 there
[46:41] no the the standard is getting smaller
[46:43] and smaller to spare them all he said
[46:46] behold now I've taken upon me to speak
[46:48] the Lord PR Adventure there shall be 20
[46:50] found there and the Lord answers I will
[46:53] not destroy it for 20's
[46:55] sake and he said oh Lord let not the
[46:57] Lord be angry and I will speak yet but
[47:00] this
[47:00] once after all these
[47:03] others per Adventure 10 shall be found
[47:06] there and he said I will not destroy it
[47:10] for 10's
[47:12] sake and that's where the story
[47:15] stops nothing else is said of Abraham
[47:19] pleading anymore interceding anymore
[47:22] saying well what about four what about
[47:24] one and it says and the Lord went his
[47:26] way as soon as he had left communion
[47:28] with Abraham and Abraham returned unto
[47:32] his
[47:34] place and as I already mentioned perhaps
[47:38] in that
[47:42] place that because of
[47:45] Abraham God spares
[47:48] lot as it says in verse 29 and it came
[47:51] to pass when God destroyed the cities of
[47:52] the plain that God remembered Abraham
[47:56] and sent lot out of the midst of the
[47:57] overthrow when he overthrew the cities
[48:00] in which lot
[48:03] dwelt God remembered
[48:06] Abraham and he uses Abraham as the
[48:08] remembrance when he shows this great
[48:10] Mercy to his nephew
[48:12] lot if we could just look at this in one
[48:14] picture I know maybe I may not be uh
[48:18] maybe satisfied in my heart just the way
[48:19] it might be looking from my vantage
[48:21] point but I hope there's a picture here
[48:22] that you could somehow Cobble together
[48:24] with spiritual eyes that Abraham the
[48:27] father of our faith to whom God was
[48:30] going to reveal his will to judge and to
[48:34] destroy that now is the time of judgment
[48:37] now is the time of
[48:38] justice that yes I'm revealing myself to
[48:41] you in Grace I'm confirming my Covenant
[48:43] with you but there's going to be
[48:45] judgment that's going to fall as it was
[48:47] in the days of lot where fire and
[48:48] brimstone came out of heaven and
[48:50] destroyed them all here is Abraham that
[48:52] God says I know him I know that he will
[48:56] do justce in
[48:57] judgment and God says I'm going down
[49:00] there to see if they're as wicked as I
[49:01] think they are and if not then I'll know
[49:04] and Abraham's response wasn't yeah
[49:06] they're an awful
[49:07] lot yeah you go ahead destroy them and
[49:11] listen I never liked my nephew
[49:13] anyways right he just he didn't say let
[49:16] him have it bunch of reprobate serpent
[49:19] seed never really believed the message
[49:21] anyhow his response is Lord this it
[49:25] wouldn't seem it wouldn't be like you to
[49:29] just judge without
[49:31] warning Lord it wouldn't be like you to
[49:33] not at least first find who's righteous
[49:37] so I ask if we're living in the days of
[49:39] lot where can we find this
[49:42] today where is it today that we would
[49:44] have one that would stand before the
[49:46] Lord and say Lord could you hold it back
[49:48] and spare it if there just be yet 50
[49:51] could you at least yet spare it and God
[49:53] says Fine 50 and then a heart to say
[49:55] well what about 45 what about 40 it kind
[49:57] of seems almost uh childish but what's
[49:59] he what is it showing this desire in
[50:01] Abraham's heart for not just truth but
[50:05] mercy and when I ask is there room for
[50:08] Mercy I could continue to spend service
[50:10] after service after service demonstrated
[50:13] according to the message of the hour
[50:14] that we're living in a time of judgment
[50:16] so severe that brother Brandon was even
[50:18] asking is the day of Mercy over because
[50:21] there is seemingly fulfilled in
[50:23] scripture some change from a lamb to a
[50:26] liing and things are different now than
[50:28] it had been before and we're living in a
[50:30] different time and yet it didn't cause
[50:32] brother Brandon to start sticking his
[50:34] tongue out and laughing and and and
[50:36] scolding denominations with the wrong
[50:38] kind of tone but it compelled him to say
[50:41] oh flee Babylon come out of her my
[50:44] people don't be partakers of her
[50:47] judgment
[50:49] amen and there was a Place full of
[50:53] Mercy it's not that Mercy would look at
[50:55] them and their sin in and
[50:57] go ah God just let the sodomites be
[51:00] sodomites just ah let the gorit or
[51:03] gmoran whatever we would call them let
[51:05] them be who they want to be the gor
[51:08] Iranians you know just let them
[51:11] be and those of Sodom and it wasn't it
[51:14] wasn't that well just look past it just
[51:16] forgive it but it was like it was this
[51:18] idea of Lord could there be righteous in
[51:22] there it's not indifference
[51:28] I want you to listen to this statement I
[51:30] I was saving this for later and I
[51:32] printed it just before I left the
[51:35] house but in the sermon Investments I
[51:37] believe I use this um some of these
[51:40] similar themes were preached when we
[51:42] were just starting the church and we
[51:44] were meeting in a hotel room on the
[51:46] bride's advocacy I believe I used this
[51:49] quote at that time but the sermon
[51:51] Investments and the musicians just ready
[51:53] yourselves you could come to the front
[51:54] if you'd like but catch this where where
[51:57] are we going to find this attitude today
[51:59] I'm not going to water down where we're
[52:01] at I I think I would do you a disservice
[52:03] to try to kind of soft sell it and kind
[52:06] of hedge a little bit and like ah well
[52:08] you know this hasn't really happened and
[52:09] that hasn't really happened and this
[52:11] hasn't really happened I'll be if I I'm
[52:13] obligated to tell you what brother
[52:14] bandam said and it's up to you to decide
[52:17] it's up to you to wrestle with it it's
[52:19] up to you to find where the real the
[52:21] heart of God is in these things but he
[52:22] says our Spirits this morning weep out
[52:25] for a lost world
[52:28] give us wisdom to know how to approach
[52:30] them Lord we don't want them
[52:34] lost the very Spirit within us would
[52:37] condemn us Desiring their being
[52:45] lost if we had the spirit of the lord
[52:48] inside of us and we were kind of rooting
[52:50] their destruction and we were cheering
[52:52] for them to be lost he says the spirit
[52:55] would condemn us
[52:57] says but may the Holy Spirit constantly
[52:59] cry sweep out until we put forth every
[53:02] effort with our talent with our time
[53:05] with our money with everything that
[53:08] we've
[53:09] got no matter how little it is we offer
[53:12] it to you I believe that this is a
[53:15] commandment to us we don't have a large
[53:19] church I I think that if you were to use
[53:22] different definitions I don't think you
[53:23] could come up with a definition to say
[53:25] that we have a large Church and if
[53:26] anything there's a little bit of a
[53:28] narrowing down just as it was in the
[53:29] days of Gideon there's a narrowing
[53:32] down because this is not child's play
[53:35] this is not just for volun this is not
[53:37] just playing church and we've got to
[53:39] give whatever we have talent time money
[53:42] everything no matter how little it is we
[53:44] need to offer it to him am and we might
[53:46] let up on these things remember those
[53:48] what we know to be God's perfect will I
[53:50] know God's will for me and I know what I
[53:52] ought to do we should never slack up in
[53:54] those things says help help us Lord to
[53:57] take this great message to A Dying World
[54:00] it's a message of
[54:02] judgment it's a message that's going to
[54:04] rain fire and brimstone it's a message
[54:06] that judgment is coming it's a message
[54:08] that denominations have ceased it's a
[54:10] message that that has become bloodless
[54:12] worship it's a message that the throne
[54:13] has become a judgment throne but it's in
[54:15] that message that there's Mercy he says
[54:18] let us take this message to A Dying
[54:20] World I have very little Lord that I can
[54:23] offer no ability no personality no
[54:24] nothing but I just got my soul all Lord
[54:27] my voice and it's all
[54:30] yours that's how we ought to be just as
[54:32] Abraham was in Genesis 18 my soul is all
[54:35] yours and my voice is all yours let me
[54:38] use it not my personality not my ability
[54:41] yet I give you my talent my time my
[54:43] money and everything that I've got to
[54:45] get this great message to A Dying World
[54:48] amen and find it in our hearts to say
[54:51] per Adventure
[54:52] Lord hold off the judgments
[54:56] Lord if there's going to be a time when
[54:58] the message is going to preach to only
[55:01] the eternally lost Lord just wait Lord
[55:04] wait help us to find one more let us let
[55:07] us at least speak the word because I
[55:09] want to say this lot was deemed
[55:13] righteous I had the scripture here I
[55:15] think we're just going to save it for
[55:16] another time lot is deemed righteous but
[55:19] you become the very righteousness of God
[55:22] there are those that can be saved but
[55:24] then there's those that are redeemed
[55:27] and do you realize that in this moment
[55:28] it's not that Abraham was confused about
[55:30] who the redeemed were Abraham knew
[55:32] exactly where he
[55:34] was Abraham knew this is where the son
[55:36] of man was revealing himself but yet
[55:38] there was still yet something inside him
[55:40] saying there's going to come a time when
[55:42] the one that has the confession let him
[55:44] hold it fast to the end for if he gives
[55:47] up in his confession that time of
[55:48] tribulation he's going to die and face
[55:50] judgment and be eternally lost but oh
[55:53] God if I can but at least get some to
[55:56] turn their face towards Calvary and in
[55:58] some way identify the savable yes though
[56:02] they may not be redeemable to have a
[56:04] heart to say oh God not yet don't seal
[56:08] them just yet with the mark of the
[56:11] beast oh God could it be that more can
[56:15] be
[56:17] saved I think just even that last part
[56:19] there might just add a little bit more
[56:21] weight to this in terms of understanding
[56:23] our position this in time
[56:27] but I believe that we can be we ought to
