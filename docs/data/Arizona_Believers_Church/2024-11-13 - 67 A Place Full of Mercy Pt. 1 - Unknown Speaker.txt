TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to take just a little bit of a different title today and um maybe over the next few Services take the title A Place full of mercy and this would be part one I'm just kind of planning for maybe uh four parts on this and just to connect these together we've been preaching on is there room for Mercy asking the question if there's room and I believe that through those Services though it wasn't exhaustive we've seen that this is a time of judgment that this is a dispensation where we can see in the message of the hour that there's a Binding Together uh of different things for the purpose of uh judgment and that there's a loosing of the Bride of vindication and a Justice to the bride a lot of things that we could share but this is a time of judgment so there is a a changing in the time we're living in brother BR talks about the wigged one and the supreme authority being revealed and we see even in the message of the hour that when brother brandham is identifying events that are related to Revelations chap 5 and even the revealing of the son of man it caused him to to ask the question is the day of Mercy over and he's asked very specifically in 1964 is there no more mercy and he says no there is Mercy and he goes on to uh answer that question maybe we'll get into it in more detail some other time but we can see that though this is a time of judgment and that times have changed and seasons have changed we're in this age of the son of man there's still room for Mercy or if I could say this way place for mercy and so we're wanting to look at this idea of a place that just doesn't have mercy but it's full of mercy and something I trust you've been finding in your own personal devotion and in the word of God as you just read the Bible and if you were looking for these things if you're looking for mercy and trying to study it you'll certainly have found this um but if you're just reading your Bible it's almost impossible not to come up against it but God is full of Mercy he is merciful and we talk about a Place full of Mercy I had maybe called this uh a home full of Mercy was maybe one of my first working titles but I'll put it this way a Place full of mercy and this ought to be in your heart as an individual there ought to be a Place full of Mercy in our homes our families there should be Mercy should be a dominant characteristic within our homes and certainly as a church we should be a place that is full of Mercy we know that judgment begins at the house of God and that there's a judgment aspect and there's uh things that um go forth from the word of God and things that are handled but yet we don't do it in a worldly way we don't do it in a carnal way and we don't do it because we're just full of Wrath and we we want Vindication and we want uh sin to be punished but rather we we judge according to God's word we let God be the judge and we know that with judgment there is Mercy now if you could look at Genesis Chapter 18 I'll start with verse 16 uh I'm not going to go all the way to verse 33 at this point we'll just go to verse 18 I believe but I I thought it was good that on Sunday brother Jason dears uh went to this scripture at some point so I think there's even a way that we could uh take some of those things that he said on a word family and the role of the patriarch and the nature of a patriarch even take that thought that he was on Sunday Kind of now look at this as a Place full of mercy and identify what would be the kind of characteristic of an Abraham today especially as we see Abraham here the father of Faith he's a patriarch and there's things about him in this scripture that we would admire and that we would say this is what a man should do in his home but we don't want to just uh we don't want to misinterpret the word of God and be a bro AB Broham we want to be Abraham right we want to be a real genuine patriarch so in Genesis 18:16 it says and the men rose up from then and looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way so now he's going to guide them a little bit to show them the way that they need to go but he's not going to go down into Sodom and then the scripture is able to give us insight into what God is thinking because it says and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him now he's given us some reasons why should I hide from Abraham what I'm going to do and he's given us some reasons why he shouldn't he says for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he ha spoken of him so God expressed expresses his desire to reveal his will to Abraham we we read he says shall I hide this thing from that I do from Abraham but in one way we could say he's saying should I reveal my will to Abraham so what he's wanting to do is give a revelation of the word revelation of future events he's wanting to disclose to him things and purposes and intents in his heart and when he's answering this question of should I do it should I reveal my word he answers in a rhetorical sense uh that yes I should because uh Abraham is going to be a great and mighty nation and the nations of the earth going to be blessed in him and he says for I know him and there's a certain character that God highlights and I'm wanting to zero in on these characteristics tonight still on the subject of mercy and a Place full of mercy and this is where I want to start to begin to bring this out further but he says that he's going to teach his children the way of the Lord he's going to teach him God's nature God's will God's character he's not just going to tell him factual things about God but he's going to teach them the way to keep the way of the Lord he's going to command his children and his household after him that they shall keep the way of the Lord so God will make known his will to Abraham he's going to reveal things to Abraham because Abraham would communicate it to those who need it catch this as even brother Jason was pointing out on Sunday how that here's a patriarch here's a father who's going to teach his children and teach his household but God was going to reveal this to Abraham because because Abraham would communicate divine revelation to his children and to his household and having this true knowledge he would teach he would instruct he would guide in that truth he wouldn't just kind of keep it to himself but he would say well having uh the word revealed to me I have responsibility to my children my immediate family and it wasn't just his immediate family but it was his household his servants and those uh that had come into his personal orbit that maybe worked for him and we might call them slaves or servants and these different things were joined to him he was going to teach them as well and this teaching your children becomes very demonstrative in the new Old Testament once the law is given Deuteronomy 6: 4-9 here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart now here is he says he will command his children his household after him so this is going to be a commandment given to Abraham it's going to be in his heart and then he's going to uh then teach his children and command them to keep the way of the Lord and he says and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sest in thine house when thou walst by the way and when thou liest down and when thy riseth up so in other words at all times till maybe seems to be some kind of archaic language or Old English but it's just a phrasing to suggest that it's always appropriate it's a good time to do do it and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes what is it talking about when you work what you what you do what you see what you think and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates why would these things that are being commanded to them this day why would they be taught why would they be taught diligently and why would they be always reminded of it because the goal was to keep the way of the Lord and so just as it was given in Deuteronomy it wasn't just that the word would be on these little things everywhere and they had these little things physically to remind them of the word but he really wanted it in their heart and so one way of imparting this knowledge is to teach and instruct and give children knowledge of the word of God this would be the a role of a father a patriarch within the home and God says he knows this about Abraham that if I reveal my will to him he will communicate my will to the children that they would keep the way of the Lord and the way of the Lord is described as doing Justice and judgment J I want to focus on those phrases Justice and judgment are the ways of the Lord I believe this is a real critical piece to God reveal in his word God wants to make his will known God wants to reveal his word to you wants to give you answers and there's a way that God wants you to handle that word once it's been revealed to you and so there are certain qualifications and certain characteristics that need to be molded in us for God to give us this Sovereign divine revelation of his perfect will and so just Justice in the scriptures it's used here to do justice it's often translated and very frequently translated to righteousness so it says to do righteousness or to do right to do justice and judgment and this Justice and judgment are unfailing Eternal attributes of God not just something that uh God stumbles on or oops look what I did there I judged but God is an eternal God who is a God of Justice and a god of judgment they're Eternal attributes of God Deuteronomy 32:4 says he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of Truth and without iniquity just and right is he this is uh describing Our God who is eternal Our God who is but one Lord all his ways are Justice and judgment all his way are true he's a god of Truth which is to be steadfast or faithful without iniquity that means without Injustice it means he's not wrong whatever ever God does is right so if God does something if we knew absolutely 100% God did something we should never ask well was that right it's always right if God speaks something we shouldn't say well I wonder if that's true if we absolutely know that God said something then it's truth amen if we absolutely know God did something then it's right now we can wrestle with our own sense of um righteousness and our own sense of correctness but if it's God whatever he says is true whatever he does is just these are just attributes specifically to God Alone he is a god of Truth and without iniquity he has no Injustice as Paul says in Romans chapter 9: 13-6 as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated now that Paul anticipates the objection wait a minute God loves one and hates the other what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God is there Injustice with God Justice is righteousness this unrighteousness would be unfairness or inequitable uh he's is he is he injust is this an injustice that God would want love one in not love the other actually just hate the other he says God forbid in other words God is Not unjust for he saith to Moses and I don't know that this helps uh he say well no God's Fair he'll hate who he wants and loves who he wants but it is it's exactly what he's saying he said I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have comp compassion is God unjust no but he is merciful on those he will have mercy and he has compassion on Those whom he will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy Paul doesn't back away from it he just continues to lean into it and says that God loves one and hates the other we say well that's not fair that's not just and he goes through it in more detail in Romans 9 well shall the clay say to the the one that formed it uh that's not right and so he's really dealing with some very weighty things things that could cause a paradox things that cause people to wrestle but the Bible says just and right is he just means he's right he's correct he's lawful he's righteous just and right that means straight he's correct it's proper proper it's level this is what God is he's just and right he's a rock his work is perfect all his ways are judgment really focusing on this characteristic that Abraham was going to teach his children to do Justice and judgment we really need to understand these phrases this characteristic that Abraham is going to have he's going to teach his children and Joseph Addison how many read The Works of Joseph Addison did you ever read the guardian in 17113 no okay on issue number nine on July 4th 1713 in the guardian Joseph Addison wrote there is no virtue so truly great and Godlike as Justice most of the other virtues are virtues of created being or accommodated to our nature as we are men Justice is that which is practiced by God himself and to be practiced in its Perfection by none but him omniscience and omnipotence are required for the full execution of it I had to uh type this up reading the old English font and spelling and everything so if I got something wrong it's because I don't know what omnipotence is and I assumed it was omniscience omniscience and omnipotence are required for the full execution of it the one omniscience to discover every degree of uprightness or iniquity in thoughts words and actions it's powerful the other which would be his omnipotence to measure out and inflict suitable rewards and punishments as to be perfectly just is an attribute in the divine nature to be so to the utmost of our ability is the glory of a man I like that you may not like Joseph Addison the Brit that he was but in reading this to me it is so true there's no virtue so truly great and Godlike as Justice and this Justice is something that could only be perfectly executed by God himself and that in this he is all knowing so that he can know thoughts and actions and words and deeds and thoughts and intents and then he could have the power to judge it or reward it appropriately and he said it's part of the divine nature and then this fact that the glory of man would be to strive to our utmost ability to do the same that is the glory of a man right is to to search and to strive for justice and this speaks to the importance of justice and even want to begin to look at the scriptures well then what is Justice if this is something that is attributable to God it's something that only God himself can be practiced by only God himself can practice it perfectly in Isaiah 59:14 and judgment is turned away backward there's a lot more in this chapter I wanted to explore but for time sake we'll just take this verse out of out of this reading and judgment is turned away backward and Justice standeth a far off for truth is fallen in the street and Equity cannot enter what a beautiful uh picture that's painted with these words that judgment has been turned aside and Justice is kind of lingering far off because truth is Fallen since truth is not being upheld and since truth does not have a place uh and Equity cannot enter you cannot have Justice or judgment so one thing I want you to see and I don't have time maybe to explore in great detail tonight but Justice is truth in action you can't just think about something and well I I think you're right and if anything being a parent has really taught me this that just acknowledging that one is right or acknowledging that one has been wronged really isn't enough for fairness right you've got to kick that kid out of the house who took this from me and he should no longer exist whatsoever forever more dad do something about it are you going to do something about it why because Justice is truth in action and one thing I want you to catch very quickly is Justice and Truth are connected you cannot have Justice without truth and I know you're thinking no justice no peace but no truth no justice let's add that to our protest signs that without truth you cannot have Justice amen and if you were to uh destroy the truth and uh tear down the truth or lie you can't get Justice you can lie say well he did it he did it this is what happened and get all the facts together and then you judge on the basis of those facts and then find out that those were lies justice has not been done so Justice and Truth are work together they cannot be separated Psalms 33:4 for the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth all his ways are perfect his work work is perfect all his ways are Justice and the god of Truth and without iniquity just and right is he his works are done in truth justice itself means to be right to be fair to be just is to be right and correct so Justice is to be just to be justce to be right and correct and really maybe the word that we're describing for us is when something is fair it's that uh that quality of being free from favoritism or bias it disqualifies all of us we just have some inherent bias all it takes is I mean just just go to a baseball game a and then they're going to put up on the screen a DOT race you're going have to choose between red yellow and blue and guess what and green and all of a sudden you're going to have a color you like and you're going to want that color to win for no particular reason but they just and then they do it with you know frankfurters and hot dogs and what do we have here presidents is it presidents that race here no that's in that's in Washington what is it that races here come on sport sports fans what we don't have a we don't have a a race in Tex or here in Arizona my goodness we need to give some to the Bob the bank one ballpark not even called that anymore Chase Field we need some games but there's a this idea of being impartial that would be something that is fair it's impartial it's just to all parties it's Equitable you don't just pick something for some reason and you're going to say well no matter what this is right and and pick sides that's why it's Addison himself that makes the comment Justice discards party friendship Kindred and therefore always is represented as Blind Justice is blind in what sense that it doesn't know truth no in the sense that it will not favor party friendship Kindred it's blind because it will only go by knowledge and truth it won't just pick up favorites or have a bias or or be prejudiced towards something and God is a God of Justice Justice and Truth are connected together and just as you cannot have Justice or judgment without truth the same goes for Mercy this is me just trying to gather some of these things within our views so we can compare them together in Proverbs 14:22 do they not Heir that devise evil but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good so here's those that devise evil certainly there's going to be punishment but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good this Mercy then is somehow joined with the truth that they are doing good the reality that they're doing good so mercy and Truth are to them in Psalms 2510 we've already read that the ways of the Lord are right they are just they are true all the paths of the Lord are mercy and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant and his testimonies so now it's mercy and Truth are the paths of the Lord then Proverbs 16 I encourage you maybe to go and read that in total there's a lot on this very subject the entire chapter by Mercy and Truth is Iniquity purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil evil how is Iniquity purged not just by truth but Mercy amen by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged these are things I want you to see that they we have Justice and truth that are connected and now we have mercy connected with truth so we can see Truth at the middle Truth at the heart the word of God at the heart in Justice is connected with the word and and and mercy is connected with the word in psalm 85 it says Lord thou H has been favorable into thy land thou Hast brought back the Captivity of Jacob thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou has covered all their sins say law thou has taken away all thy wrath thou has turned thyself from the fierceness of thy anger turn us oh god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease wil thou be angry with us forever and all the children said amen wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations and I love this will sh thou not revive us again something to this request and this cry that thy people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant us thy salvation I will hear what the Lord what God the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that the glory May dwell That Glory May dwell in our land now notice this Proclamation Mercy and Truth are met together are you going to be angry with us forever are you going to revive us are you going to is your will your anger ever subside he says mercy and Truth are met together show us Mercy where are we going to get this Mercy when truth comes mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other what does this speak of the Messiah amen that in the Messiah who is the way the truth the life in him was found not only truth but Mercy in that truth and where mercy and Truth are met together verse 11 truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven yay the Lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her Increase righteousness shall go before him here's the Messiah righteousness shall go before him and Shall Set us in the way of his steps it's the very thing that we see pattern and Abraham who would teach his children to keep the Commandments of the Lord and to keep the way of the Lord and that way is to do justce Justice and judgment the Bible says in 1st Chronicles chapter 16:34 I'm going I'm going over this quickly I know but I just want you to see these scriptures mercy and Truth are met together in Christ there is truth in Christ there is Mercy 1st Chronicles 16:34 and you'll find this passage related in the in in other places in Psalm this very exact scenario oh give thanks unto the Lord for his good for his mercy endureth forever 41 times in the Bible is this phrase written his mercy endureth forever that's that's that reputation is for a reason something that is repeated more often than anything else almost for his mercy endureth forever I didn't do a search to compare it to others you can have chat GPT do it later but for his mercy endureth forever 41 times it is said there's some enduring quality about mercy and his Mercy enduring forever notice what it says about his Justice Psalms 111:3 his work is Honorable and glorious and his righteousness endureth forever that righteousness there is the same word justice in in Genesis Genesis 11942 the righteousness is an everlasting righteousness thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness in thy law is the truth Psalms 117: 1 and 2 Oh Praise the Lord all you Nations praise him all you people people for his merciful kindness is great towards us and the truth of the Lord endureth forever praise ye the Lord his word shall never fail his word shall never pass away his word is enduring and in his word is Justice and judgment in his word is Mercy for his righteousness endureth forever his mercy endureth forever Psalms 1191 16 Thy word is true from the beginning in every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever these are the qualities of justice and judgment they endure forever wanting you to see this that God is merciful that God is a god of compassion God is a god of Mercy is full of Mercy he's also a God of Justice and judgment and Justice and Truth go together you have truth it's married with Justice and you cannot separate it but then there's this other facet of it where there's also Mercy that's joined to it as well mercy and Truth are met together and in Psalms 89:14 it says justice and judgment are the habitation of thy Throne mercy and Truth Shall go before thy face these aren't competing with each other say well I mean Justice and judgment are the habitation of his throne but mercy and truth will go before thy face these are to these work together these things how unjust would Justice be without truth right how unfair would judgment be and unequitable and how not judgment would it be without truth but Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy Throne this is how a throne ought to be established in righteousness and uprightness and integrity and mercy and Truth Shall go before thy face these are the very things that Abraham would follow the very things that would be revealed to Abraham and it's the very things that Abraham would teach his children and his household Justice and judgment I know we're not spending a lot of time on judgment but judgment in the this word that's used in Genesis the act of deciding or it's a place of decision the place or the court or the seat of judgment together if you say justice and judgment it's this phrase that gives rise to this image of one who is in the place of deciding something gives us image of a judge or a king or or a leader and this Justice that's being spoken of to teach he would teach his children and even this Justice that we're commanded to have in scripture maybe we'll find more of these instances later but it's to do that which is right between man and man that if there's going to be Justice if we're going to uh teach Justice and we're going to be just and right we're going to do that which is right between man and man it speaks of truthfulness so you can't have Justice without truth you cannot have mercy without truth says of David 2 Samuel verse chapter 8 verse 15 you can find this a few places and David reigned over all Israel and David executed judgment and Justice unto all his people this is his authority as king they weren't ruled by a judge he became the king he's the one that would dispense Justice he's the one that could decide he's the one that would make decisions and then of Solomon whom we know to be the wisest in all the world in First Kings 10:9 believe this is Shea even speaking this blessed be the Lord thy God which delighteth in thee to set thee on the throne of Israel because the Lord loved Israel forever therefore made he thee King to do judgment and Justice these are the habitation of a throne these ought to be the habitations of a judge could you imagine if you're going to see you someone files a court case and it gets served to you and a a and you're going to find someone who going to be uh the captain of chaos and that's who you have to appear before wait a minute they're suing me in small claims court and he's called the captain of chaos he'd be a little bit nervous but he's actually called Justice of the Peace why because it's to convey some qualification and some that what you would want You' expect I mean if you're low down dirty rotten uh fraud you don't really want to go get Justice you don't want to get judgment you'd love to know Captain Chaos is up there so that he can make a mistake and maybe vindicate you but when we are in these courts when we're in these situations we want Integrity we want truth we want righteousness Justice and judgment is how this Throne is established these are the the nature and qualification of a king of a judge and then it said of the Messiah in Isaiah chapter 9: 6 and 7 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace these are the this is what he will be called of the increase of his government in peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this the Messiah is going to establish his kingdom with judgment and with Justice even forever more these are the marks and characteristics of a righteous king of a righteous judge these are the the the qualities of God who judges correctly I want this to be I know that in in my studying this there's so many more I find myself just page after page after page of scriptures on these characteristics of God and Justice and judgment and I've even left out the Judgment part these are just things that come in View and we begin to look at Justice that Justice is truth in action it is his character and quality of God who himself is true he's one that is true he's the he is the word the word from the beginning and the word from the beginning was true and every one of his uh judgments are righteous and his Justice endureth forever because in truth there's justice but in that same truth there's also Mercy these things are working together they're they're part to each other and it's in this Messiah that we see that mercy and Truth are met together that in this Messiah there's judgment and Justice can you just see these things they don't have to necessarily all fit fit right now but can you just kind of see them floating into view these things are there you could wrestle them out you can uh pray to have God just piece these things together but let's go back to this conversation or this scene with Abraham the men rose up to go into Sodom and they had obviously beforehand been commanded to go and this was part of the mission and part of the plan and then as they get up to go and Abraham's kind of sauntering with them God discloses something that's in his heart or at least something that's in his will as he's expressing this and he says shall I hide from him what I'm going to do and a phrase that he uses in verse 19 is for I know him what was it that God saw on Abraham he says I know him and I'll just mention a few things brother bradam said he constantly made mistakes he doubted God he lied about his wife there's things that Abraham did where you could see that there was this pattern of fear and doubt there a pattern of even being carnal that there was a pattern where Abraham maybe to this point hadn't really uh yielded completely and hadn't fully caught the Revelation and a Abraham was making had made these mistakes but God says I know him and when he said he knew him it wasn't that he knew his past he knew his history he knew the Optics and the the veneer of Abraham but he knew his heart in Psalms 4 44: 21 shall not God search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart Abraham God knew Abraham's heart so he knew that not only as the scripture says he would teach his children his household but what what it assumes in that is he could also be taught right there was something about Abraham's heart that I can show him my will and when I show him my will he'll be receptive to it he can receive it his heart can be molded by this Revelation and having been molded and set right by this Revelation he's then going to teach this himself because God knows the secrets of the heart God knew the heart of Abraham I was going to use this passage in Proverbs 3 as my text verses 3 and four and that I just kind of struggled just where to put this but it says let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness and he was called a friend of God something about Abraham's nature and disposition something is expressed in Abraham's life yes he believed God he's the patriarch of Faith but when he had when he heard these things from God he would bind them about his neck he would write them upon the table of his heart and the command is let not mercy and Truth forsake Thee I know we want to say well he's a god of Truth he's a the word the word the word the word only and there's a lot of things that we like to say and a lot of mantras that we might have but it's not saying just let Truth uh uh let not Truth for safety but it's also kind of giving this as the lead in let not Mercy In Truth for safety don't just bind the truth about thy neck and write it upon the table of th heart but let mercy be there also if this happens and you'll find favor with man you'll find good understanding in the sight of man and in the sight of God God would reveal truth to Abraham God would reveal Mercy to Abraham and God knew that Abraham would fill up his heart with it not just with truth but Mercy he knew there was something in Abraham what he saw in Abraham I know maybe there's just kind of peeking open the door a little bit bit in that which says I know him well what did he know about him for I know him that he will command his children his household after him you know that shows shows more concern than just for himself he knew something about the heart of Abraham for I know him and that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him and in verse 20 so go forward here making really really good time we could beat the crowds to In and Out Genesis 18: 20 21 and 22 and the Lord said now kind of catch what's happening here he says shall I hide this thing from Abraham so what he says next is this is God revealing something to Abraham because the Cry of Sodom and gomor is great because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done Al together according to the Cry of it which has come unto me and if not I will know no not now I want you to think of this this phrase that God speaks to Abraham is part of him disclosing his will to Abraham and as we'll see Abraham catches a revelation of what's being said he catches a revelation of something about the nature and character of God and the men turn their faces from th and and went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord God tells Abraham that he will see if Sodom and Gomorrah deserve the Judgment what a remarkable statement he goes I'm going to go down he's going to go down in the person of these two witnesses and he's going to see whether the cry that he has heard of this wickedness and this unlawfulness and this perversion he's going to see whether or not it is so cuz he says once he sees he will know in other words God is going to examine first or in this action that this their their conduct and their behavior is deserving of judgment but he's going to come first yeah and see and he says if not I will know so there's something revealed in this remember in Luke chapter 17 veres 28 to3 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded and these are the cries that come up before God and he says I'm going to go down and I'm going to visit they're eating they're drinking they're buying they're selling planting the building and I'm going to see what's in it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all here's your judgment even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed right these events of Genesis 18 are very important to us in the age of the son of man revealing himself in this dispensation of judgment and Truth he says I will go down now and see if they're doing evil and if not I will know and as soon as God says this he tells us that the men turned and went down toward Sodom but Abraham stays with the Lord he stood yet before the Lord and what I want you to see is that immediately Abraham demonstrates what God knew about Abraham he says I know Abraham so I'm going to tell Abraham what I'm going to do and I know Abraham is going to be of a certain character and disposition and he immediately demonstrates what God on his heart from Proverbs 21: 1:3 the king's heart is the hand of the Lord as the rivers of water he turneth it withersoever he will every way of man is right in his own eyes but the Lord pth the hearts to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice now remember how to obey is better than sacrifice that stubbornness and and Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft and so there's certain itics and certain things enforced uh taking away our liberties and these iniquities and rebellions and these things that we've seen in the word to this point and how to obey is better than sacrifice something that Saul just couldn't quite get and here he's saying Justice and judgment are more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice all the religious pretense all the things we could put out front Oh Lord You're awesome Oh Lord You're great there's only one God you're great you're wonderful and he's saying well you could do all these things but neglect the weightier matters of the law like truth and Justice and mercy good to do justice to do right and to judge is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice this is what would please God this is what God wants to see Abraham was one who continually offered Abraham had even served him at the tent door Abraham was one of a life of service and and these different things but now in this great moment he says will I hide from Abraham that which I want to do and he goes no I won't I'll tell him exactly what I'm do going to do because I know him that he will do justice and judgment so notice this and the men turned their faces from th and went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and Abraham Drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the Wicked This is what he he catches we read says well God's just going to go down and see whether or not the cry is right I'm going to go down and see if they're being Wicked I'm going to go down see if they're being unrighteous I want to see and if they're not I'll know and Abraham catches the Revelation he sees Into the Heart of God and knows that he wouldn't just not be going down there to witness uh frivolity he wouldn't just be going to witness perversion that there would be a consequence if God was sending a a witness and he says will you destroy the righteous with the wicked I want you to catch this as at the heart of this patriarch this one who was going to be safe from the Judgment this one who had already received enough word to know that I will visit you according to the time of life and I will come and I will visit you and Sarah shall have a son and he knows there's judgment coming into the valley there's judgment coming to lot or to Sodom and Gomorrah and he's not worried about himself he knows he's safe with the Lord he's there under a promise but now he says will you destroy the righteous with the wicked I notice what he says per Adventure there be 50 righteous within the city wil thou also destroy and not spare the place for the 50 righteous that are therein this is quite a statement from Abraham and notice he says that be far from thee so amazing that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked you'll find that in the scripture judgment is often translated to manner after this manner this be far from thee to do after this kind of judgment this is far from your judgment to slay righteous with the wicked you're not this kind of God this isn't the kind of God that you are and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee wow this is reminds me of Moses standing in the Gap this reminds me of one who is responding back to God not in a way to rebuke God but in a way of reminding God something about him something that Abraham had learned about God Amen the the righteous uh be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the Earth do right th not the judge of all the Earth do justice I don't know if it says this in your Bible it doesn't say it in mine but I think this would be a fair heading Abraham intercedes before God God has said he's visited Abraham he's revealed himself to Abraham Abraham is there under a promise you know the promised son is soon coming he can sit there in rest knowing that through Sarah is going the seed is going to be but now God says I'm going to bring judgment upon Sodom and gomorra and Abraham intercedes before God he appeals to God's character amen he doesn't object and say well you're un righteous he says you're a righteous God he's not saying that's unfair he just begins to remind God of his own character as a righteous judge he's saying you would not punish them without first warning them he would not punish them without first giving them the truth and and cultivating and calling out and identifying the righteous Abraham saying I know it looks awful I know it looks ugly but God could you not go down and find and identify righteous people and Abraham responded to God according to his God's revealed will and character right he interceded you know what he was doing he was an intercessor he's mediating he's interceding showing the mercy of God which endures forever and he demonstrates God's justice and judgment by appealing for salvation in a time of judgment he said God I I know you're a just God you're a judge of all the Earth and can you shall not the judge of all the Earth do justice so he's appealing what if there's 50 righteous in the city what what would and this is him you know what notice this too he's not just arguing for lot he's arguing for the righteous in the city he he's pleading on behalf of those unknown to him he doesn't say and it's it's not here in the Bible as we read it here it doesn't say that Abraham oh but what about lot my nephew and his family and and these and all that they might be associated with and their friends and their neighbors he doesn't say that but when it comes time this is this is not in the in the interceding of Abraham in the scripture but when God does rescue lot as we read later you'll find that it says and because of Abraham God rescued lot and it says he showed of mercy and he was merciful to him and it was because of Abraham why I imagine that it must have been in there too that go that go Abraham be to intercede for lot says I know he chose that place I know he went down there I know he doesn't believe all the way but yet there was something in Abraham that although he had truth although he had uh this mezic relationship although he had this Elohim being revealed to him he didn't just become all Justice and wrath and judgment but there was a character of God in his heart to say wait Lord what about anybody could there be anybody else that can be saved and notice how Abraham now begins to demonstrate this Justice and judgment and so the Lord says in verse 26 if I find in Sodom 50 righteous within within the city then I will spare all the place for their sakes and Abraham answered and said notice this real it's a boldness but yet it's behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which am but dust and Ashes and he's acknowledging his smallness before God and then he begins he he doesn't say okay that if there's 50 you'll spare it okay notice what he begins to say he he pushes it further per Adventure there shall lack five of the 50 righteous will th destroy all the city for lack of five notice how he's he's still compelled he's still uh uh not bargaining but pleading with God God says okay if I find 50 I I won't destroy them all he says well what about 45 and he says and he said if I find there 45 I will not destroy it so God says okay Abraham and I think God's liking this God likes this this Instinct in Abraham this is somebody that he could see in Abraham this is the kind of quality I want in my chosen this is the kind of quality I want in my elect and Abraham's and he spake unto him yet again and said per Adventure there shall be 40 found there and he said I will not do it for 40 sake and he said and all let not the Lord be angry and I will speak per Adventure there shall be 30 there shall 30 be found there and he said I will not do it if I find 30 there no the the standard is getting smaller and smaller to spare them all he said behold now I've taken upon me to speak the Lord PR Adventure there shall be 20 found there and the Lord answers I will not destroy it for 20's sake and he said oh Lord let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once after all these others per Adventure 10 shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for 10's sake and that's where the story stops nothing else is said of Abraham pleading anymore interceding anymore saying well what about four what about one and it says and the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communion with Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place and as I already mentioned perhaps in that place that because of Abraham God spares lot as it says in verse 29 and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt God remembered Abraham and he uses Abraham as the remembrance when he shows this great Mercy to his nephew lot if we could just look at this in one picture I know maybe I may not be uh maybe satisfied in my heart just the way it might be looking from my vantage point but I hope there's a picture here that you could somehow Cobble together with spiritual eyes that Abraham the father of our faith to whom God was going to reveal his will to judge and to destroy that now is the time of judgment now is the time of justice that yes I'm revealing myself to you in Grace I'm confirming my Covenant with you but there's going to be judgment that's going to fall as it was in the days of lot where fire and brimstone came out of heaven and destroyed them all here is Abraham that God says I know him I know that he will do justce in judgment and God says I'm going down there to see if they're as wicked as I think they are and if not then I'll know and Abraham's response wasn't yeah they're an awful lot yeah you go ahead destroy them and listen I never liked my nephew anyways right he just he didn't say let him have it bunch of reprobate serpent seed never really believed the message anyhow his response is Lord this it wouldn't seem it wouldn't be like you to just judge without warning Lord it wouldn't be like you to not at least first find who's righteous so I ask if we're living in the days of lot where can we find this today where is it today that we would have one that would stand before the Lord and say Lord could you hold it back and spare it if there just be yet 50 could you at least yet spare it and God says Fine 50 and then a heart to say well what about 45 what about 40 it kind of seems almost uh childish but what's he what is it showing this desire in Abraham's heart for not just truth but mercy and when I ask is there room for Mercy I could continue to spend service after service after service demonstrated according to the message of the hour that we're living in a time of judgment so severe that brother Brandon was even asking is the day of Mercy over because there is seemingly fulfilled in scripture some change from a lamb to a liing and things are different now than it had been before and we're living in a different time and yet it didn't cause brother Brandon to start sticking his tongue out and laughing and and and scolding denominations with the wrong kind of tone but it compelled him to say oh flee Babylon come out of her my people don't be partakers of her judgment amen and there was a Place full of Mercy it's not that Mercy would look at them and their sin in and go ah God just let the sodomites be sodomites just ah let the gorit or gmoran whatever we would call them let them be who they want to be the gor Iranians you know just let them be and those of Sodom and it wasn't it wasn't that well just look past it just forgive it but it was like it was this idea of Lord could there be righteous in there it's not indifference I want you to listen to this statement I I was saving this for later and I printed it just before I left the house but in the sermon Investments I believe I use this um some of these similar themes were preached when we were just starting the church and we were meeting in a hotel room on the bride's advocacy I believe I used this quote at that time but the sermon Investments and the musicians just ready yourselves you could come to the front if you'd like but catch this where where are we going to find this attitude today I'm not going to water down where we're at I I think I would do you a disservice to try to kind of soft sell it and kind of hedge a little bit and like ah well you know this hasn't really happened and that hasn't really happened and this hasn't really happened I'll be if I I'm obligated to tell you what brother bandam said and it's up to you to decide it's up to you to wrestle with it it's up to you to find where the real the heart of God is in these things but he says our Spirits this morning weep out for a lost world give us wisdom to know how to approach them Lord we don't want them lost the very Spirit within us would condemn us Desiring their being lost if we had the spirit of the lord inside of us and we were kind of rooting their destruction and we were cheering for them to be lost he says the spirit would condemn us says but may the Holy Spirit constantly cry sweep out until we put forth every effort with our talent with our time with our money with everything that we've got no matter how little it is we offer it to you I believe that this is a commandment to us we don't have a large church I I think that if you were to use different definitions I don't think you could come up with a definition to say that we have a large Church and if anything there's a little bit of a narrowing down just as it was in the days of Gideon there's a narrowing down because this is not child's play this is not just for volun this is not just playing church and we've got to give whatever we have talent time money everything no matter how little it is we need to offer it to him am and we might let up on these things remember those what we know to be God's perfect will I know God's will for me and I know what I ought to do we should never slack up in those things says help help us Lord to take this great message to A Dying World it's a message of judgment it's a message that's going to rain fire and brimstone it's a message that judgment is coming it's a message that denominations have ceased it's a message that that has become bloodless worship it's a message that the throne has become a judgment throne but it's in that message that there's Mercy he says let us take this message to A Dying World I have very little Lord that I can offer no ability no personality no nothing but I just got my soul all Lord my voice and it's all yours that's how we ought to be just as Abraham was in Genesis 18 my soul is all yours and my voice is all yours let me use it not my personality not my ability yet I give you my talent my time my money and everything that I've got to get this great message to A Dying World amen and find it in our hearts to say per Adventure Lord hold off the judgments Lord if there's going to be a time when the message is going to preach to only the eternally lost Lord just wait Lord wait help us to find one more let us let us at least speak the word because I want to say this lot was deemed righteous I had the scripture here I think we're just going to save it for another time lot is deemed righteous but you become the very righteousness of God there are those that can be saved but then there's those that are redeemed and do you realize that in this moment it's not that Abraham was confused about who the redeemed were Abraham knew exactly where he was Abraham knew this is where the son of man was revealing himself but yet there was still yet something inside him saying there's going to come a time when the one that has the confession let him hold it fast to the end for if he gives up in his confession that time of tribulation he's going to die and face judgment and be eternally lost but oh God if I can but at least get some to turn their face towards Calvary and in some way identify the savable yes though they may not be redeemable to have a heart to say oh God not yet don't seal them just yet with the mark of the beast oh God could it be that more can be saved I think just even that last part there might just add a little bit more weight to this in terms of understanding our position this in time but I believe that we can be we ought to be we ought to have with the right understanding a Place full of Mercy could we just stand and pray together
