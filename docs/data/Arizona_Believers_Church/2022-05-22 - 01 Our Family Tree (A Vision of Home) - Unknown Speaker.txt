TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um i think it's working a little bit there's just a few slides i want to take control of here in a little bit but let's start in power of transformation i'm gonna use this as my foundational uh statement to you today and i'm gonna be drawing from this and we'll give you our title here in a moment so if you have that place in your notes just hold steady and i want to focus on a number of statements in this because this is uh you know kind of like a part of the foundation and the structure says now we find everything in order he spoke speaking about in the garden of eden what we read in revelations chapter 22 parallels the descriptions of the garden of eden it says now we find everything in order that's a key phrase there everything in order god spoke it and he said let there be let there be and let there be an eden let there be beautiful flowers let there be my son in my own image stand over there in the garden of eden and let his bride stand by his side that's kind of the quotation or summary of what god was speaking he says oh how beautiful what that was and the father he was a father and so there come his own children coming forth son and daughter of god he's a father his own children coming forth and if you want to listen to uh power of transformation god's power to transform there's a lot of themes in that that fit with this and he says and he made a paradise for them and he and he's connecting this to his office as a father he says god loves to do things for his children loving to do something for his children placing his son and his daughter there all his own children coming forth he says he made a paradise for them god loves to do things for his children don't you remember you mothers how no matter how if you had an allowance the had to allowance the table if junior needs a good pair of shoes that he liked you'd do it he's saying that this is what motherhood does if you needed to sell something in order to get your children something they needed you would do it whatever it was to do something for your children dad how you'd work a little harder to get something for the children is that not true i tell my kids whenever they come into my office which is my room which is my everything it's that's where i i never leave that room uh pray for me and um kids will come in and they'll and they'll ask me a question and i'll say i'm working to buy you toys and and and they're wondering where the toys are but but you work you work to get things for your children and if you need to work a little extra hard um to get them something uh you would do it and i think that's the heart of a parent that's the heart of a father and he says well that just shows that we are way down here a parent which reminds me of the dad joke i told in south carolina that ellie appreciated is when does a joke become a dad joke when it becomes apparent says he says that shows that we are way down here a parent and he says he is the extreme parent and how much more so that parallel even jesus saying if you ask your father uh for an egg will give you a serpent if you ask him for bread would he give you a stone how much more your heavenly father so brother brahms drawn this parallel that god is the ultimate parent he is the source of all parenthood and that just as we would do things for our own children god he's extreme he's the extreme parent he's the uber parent he's a supreme parent he's he's above and beyond what we are as parents so if there's some way that we can relate to the desires that we have in our heart and how we might treat our own children and how we would do everything we can to prepare for them he's saying he is the extreme parent now with that idea of god as the extreme parent creating a paradise i want to say this this is our journey today is going to be very vast it's a very vast and detailed journey and i'm wanting to lay a foundation for a series that i want to start called our family tree and that's going to be the series is our family tree and today my subtitle is a vision of home and so the series is going to be on our family tree and you can just begin to ponder that and realize just how rich this subject can be today i'm calling it a vision of home god dealt with me very very deeply over the last week and a half or so on some things and i was and i'm going to be very personal today to the church and god began to impress upon me certain things and i wanted to revisit the vision for this church today so part of this sermon is just revisiting the vision that we have as a church now as i as i do that i want you to recognize and i'm going to go through the scriptures just to make this connection that when i say a vision for this church i'm talking about this local church called arizona believer's church there's those that are members of this church by your attendance and by your service and by your giving and so we are i want to articulate again the vision for this church but at the same time it's not just a vision that relates to you know a corporate policy or method of operation or standard operating procedures procedures or what our purpose is this is our mission statement i'm not giving a mission statement just of the church but it will also in type show a vision for the family for your family and not only in tight but there's a direct connection to your family there is this is something something beautiful about church is it's not just something that the parents do as a hobby but it's something that all can be included in and benefit from so in this series one of my themes is going to be showing that parallel between the church even the local church even the body of christ and the family and how these things relate among each of the parts now a vision is the state of being able to see our vision is the state of being able to see all of us i see today are cited we can see some better than others but that's the being able to see or to have a vision would be the ability to think about or plan the future with wisdom now we're not doing it with imagination but to have a vision is to kind of be forward-looking and to be proactive and think about things a goal that you're trying to achieve or something that you're trying to accomplish and so what you do is you think about what you want to accomplish and then you use wisdom well you use wisdom about what you want to accomplish and then you use wisdom to plan what is it going to take to get me there if we use inversion we might say what's going to keep me from getting there and you use that wisdom to kind of figure out this is what we want to achieve this is what we want to accomplish and so when we say a vision of the church this is what we purpose to do what we plan to do what our desire is our goal is as a church now a part of that again is i want to express the vision of the church but i want you to recognize and we'll get this in very detailed that it specifically relates to the vision that we would have for family and the vision that you can have for your family and then ultimately what i want to do this morning and i'll say it now i want to emphasize christ and i want to emphasize our ultimate destiny because that's the only way we can have a vision is christ is the central part of that the central theme of that and that it's for an ultimate purpose of being in eternity because church is not for um providing access to people for multi-level marketing schemes um it's not just a place to provide babysitters for our kids uh a church has a an eternal purpose even the local church has a vision to the eternal purpose and that must always be in the forefront of our thoughts now if you'll turn to ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 to 19. i'd like to introduce and i'm not they're kind of independent i want to use i want to be able to set them apart as independent but obviously i'm wanting to connect them but introduce the family tree or a family tree and then church what what the church's local church is and and even by extension the body of christ but just kind of introduce these themes and in this scripture it kind of marries them together ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 to 19 it says for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named so now there's a family and there's a family name and it's relating to a heavenly family an earthly family and so we're getting the concept paul is looking at a family he says that he would grant you christ now or he bows unto the father that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with my by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith now that's the number one and that can only be by faith and which the seal of your faith is the baptism of the holy ghost this is his prayer this is what he bows his knees to pray that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye and now this phrase is inserted here being rooted and grounded in love so you can say being rooted and grounded in love that ye and this is the purpose now of the indwelling and the rooting and grounding that we may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god now that's a mouthful i think maybe some of the homeschool groups should have this sentence be diagrammed by the homeschoolers just to see how all these parts are connected and which ones are modifying which but he's saying the purpose of christ dwelling in our hearts the purpose of us being rooted and grounded in love is that we could comprehend and that not just individually but all of us collectively when he gets into ephesians 4 the vision of that fivefold ministry that we reference is to do this exactly this that we would all comprehend comprehension is a part of this discernment is a part of this knowledge and understanding and wisdom is a part of this not just saying i believe and it really just being kind of a mental laziness but it's a real faith that dwells in our heart that's in our hearts of christ doing our hearts by faith comprehend the breath length depth and height that's a that's a 3d revelation this is something that's uh full and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god this is the purpose of the indwelling this is the purpose of being rooted and grounded and so he says that the whole family in heaven and earth is named and then we christ dwelling in our hearts by faith makes us part of that family here on earth and he says that we ought to be rooted and grounded he's using an agricultural term and then even a um an architectural term and i just want to focus on the rooted part which was in agriculture but he's saying that you had been rooted the word is expressing that we would be as a tree whose roots go deep and not only are these roots going deep but they spread out far this is what he would like us to be able to do is he's like us to be rooted which means we are trees he's likening us to trees that are planted in the soil of love being rooted in love that means i'm going to have my roots very very deep in love and it's going to be spread out in love and that's the goal of me being planted in this love and in love having been predestinated that in this soil of love there's going to be some sort of nurturing that christ dwelling in my heart then i begin to comprehend what is the breath this is the largeness of it then the length and depth and height it's even expressing architecturally a building but then also agriculturally the plant that the roots would grow deep and spread out and then the the tree would grow up and these are the this is an image being expressed in the way that paul uh lays these things out so we are to be weird to be as trees in numbers chapter 24 verse 6 balaam is referring to israel and forgive me for quoting balaam but this is uh this is true what he has to say and uh brother balaam and i i mentioned merle haggard in the meetings in south carolina and nobody had a clue who i was talking about and numbers 2014 that's going to get everybody we need to look this up where's this thing archived in numbers 24 6 it says as the valleys are they speaking of israel spread forth so now he's wanting to imagine israel as valleys they're spread forth as gardens by the riverside so now israel is as a garden as the trees of ling alois aloes which the lord hath planted so now they're like these aloe trees trees that ling aloes and uh they are there's a maybe an image that we could provide with respect to that but he's likening israel to be in a tree here and as cedar trees besides the waters so he's describing israel as spread out as trees and just as israel in the natural um balaam could describe them we are spiritually as the body of christ as trees spread out over the earth rooted in love growing as cedar trees as laying aloes that the lord have planted we are the planting of the lord you are his vineyard and you see that symmetry maybe in other parts of the scripture you're his husbandry you're his vineyard agricultural reference but then also year god's buildings and what you recognize and i think this is maybe an important point to make that the bible's using types for us to kind of begin to comprehend just how full our literal relationship is with god and what we are to him it's not like well you got to choose one you can't be a building and a tree you have to be a tree cut down and turn into wood to be a building we're not getting legalistic with it these are just ways of trying to understand relationship you are a daughter of god and the bride of christ you are the church you are his body you are his building you are the trees you are the the fullness of him that filleth all in all these are ways just to get us to comprehend what we are in christ and so paul he says the whole family in heaven and earth is named after jesus christ and he says we ought to be rooted so i'm looking at this scripture and saying paul especially in the description of the breath length depth and height we are likened to trees and a family of trees in one sense we could say that we are a family of trees but i want to take it a step further since i'm preaching on our family tree i'd like to say we are a family of one tree a family of one tree we might just need to elevate that usb um dongle there but uh i'll just be more precise um if danielle won't get in my way i'll be able to i'll be able to catch that but i i this is these are a quaking aspens picture of them but it's a picture of what's called the pando which is the word means to spread out and these are very beautiful trees the very very striking images of this but it's a particular forest in utah it covers 107 acres with 47 000 different trees it's the world's and they call it the world's largest living organism and notice i was singular because these quaking aspen stem from a single root system and so they these 47 000 trees are genetically identical that's why they call it the world's largest living organism so we look at the trees i know there's a phrase you can't see the forest for the trees i had a similar i had a situation here recently where i couldn't see the forest for the trees i was so narrowly focused on the trees that i wasn't seeing the bigger picture and so here we look at this and we would think oh these are a series of trees 107 acres spread out in utah and over approximately 47 000 different trees and we would think each tree has come from a seed and that it's grown up from the ground and it has its own roots that are spread out going deep spreading out it grows up and i'm a tree i'm a tree i'm a tree in this forest i'm part of the pando but it's actually 47 000 genetically identical come on somebody shout right uh genetically identical trees that all stem from a single root and this is i think i pulled this from a foundation's website that seeks to preserve the pando not the panda pando there's enough of that panda preservation it's the pando that we're worried about it says above ground pando appears to be a grove of identity of individual trees like any other grove and they call it a grove technically it is pando appears to be a grove of individual trees like any other grove it was overlooked for years but underground everything is connected by a single and vast root system it is one tree h one tree forest not beautiful and and we could look at this church right now and say oh these are all just individual families coming from tucson and flagstaff and prescott and driving from all over the valley these are just all individual families that may be what it looks like on the surface but underneath we are all one tree we've partaken one bread we're part of one family a one tree forest that somebody should make a make a bumper sticker for the church no don't no but it's a it's a one tree this is not a gathering of people at an event where we all kind of show up for the event and then disperse and there's really no more connection beyond the event and so i want you to remember this image of the the pando forest this grove of over 107 acres the single the world's largest living organism in terms of the size i think they found some that it's weird how they uh quantify this but there's a humongous fungus in oregon that i believe has a different category of large in terms of maybe how heavy it is or how it's spread out i don't know but we are not the humongous fungus for every type there's an antitype whatever whatever god does satan perverts and so we are not a church of the humongous fungus we are the church of the one tree and the pastor's humongous and this uh of the humongous fungus church but so now i want you to remember this image because i'm going to be moving on from this like i said i've got a vast i didn't say long just vast journey i want to take you on today very very detailed so i want you to remember this and i'm wanting the image this our family tree and church and family even our own homes to be connected together now trees are ubiquitous they're everywhere so this is not just a concordant search for trees this is not just a message search for trees and i don't want anybody to be like oh my goodness i saw a tree on the way to church today there's trees everywhere so we can't just all of a sudden start to whisper to you over and over again trees and you're going to get some sort of revelation because they're ubiquitous they're everywhere but there's a there's a revelation that we could catch about the tree the image of the tree and even what paul is talking about here that will benefit us beyond just trying to have scratch the itch in our ears to hear something ooh that was deep or that was amazing so i really want you to focus this because this is not just me searching for trees in the bible and the message and then regurgitating it to you now vision for church is a vision or i say my heart but any local church that would have a vision or a mission statement it must harmonize with the vision of god's family brother chris this would fit in with what we were talking about last week on the five definite identifications of the true church of the living god we recognize as a local church we want to harmonize with the true church and serve the true church so a vision for a local church harmonizes with god's vision for his family and by extension your family he got is interested in you as the head of your family even to the point that if you have to separate from your parents in order to follow christ he does that so you can establish your family identity in the truth it's not that he just wants these rogue runaways that are running away from parents and separating from father and mother no the vision is that he could take you and sever you from those things that would keep you from growing in the word of god and plant you yourself that you might establish your own family according to the truth i think that's uh we could see that replete through scripture in the message now let's walk through a number of scriptures here uh on this subject of seeing the church and family connected in first timothy chapter 3 verse 15. again i'm wanting just to see these parallels and how these touch points so but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god and here's a phrase the pillar and ground of the truth we have to have these churches because they become the pillar and ground of the truth and he's saying specifically that you may know how to behave thyself in the house of god he's speaking of a gathering just like this and our behavior within it not necessarily behavior and some sort of spiritual body of christ but how we know how to behave in the house of god and then he makes this connection which is the church of the living god and so this parallel now of the house of god and the church of the living god we say god's house is his church and therefore we know that a house is where the family meets it's where the family dwells it's where a family abides it's where the family eats and so god having a house it's where his church comes together to meet to dwell to eat to commune to see one another to hear from god to hear from their father it's a it's a point of meeting in a safe place and a comfortable thing all the images and elements of home ought to somehow exist at least spiritually in this idea of the house of god he says which is the church of god so paul is connecting the house of god to the church of god which is a house is where the family meets now just prior to that 10 verses before in first timothy chapter 3 verse 5 says for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god once again paul has drawn a parallel between family or home and the church and he's making this uh remarkable statement that if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house then how shall he take care of the church of god now i know that it has probably been at least maybe we'll take the blame inferred on our part but i think it's been explicitly implied that in order for a man to rule his health it's with an iron clinch teeth right fill your house right and that's the way people feel you got a rule but rule here actually means to maintain or care for to be a protector to be a provider to give aid so if a man not know how to maintain his own house to care for it to be a protector to be a provider to give aid then how can he take care of the church of god isn't that beautiful in order to see it as maybe a ruler with an iron fist and a whip and you know there's where there's this fear factor involved where it's like well you better you better be careful you don't want the pastor getting mad and uh or even in the whole home that everyone's just walking there's people that share their experiences how they're home they're free and all of a sudden they hear the garage door open they know their dad's home from work and they completely panic seriously you laugh but they trigger you're just laughing because your dad doesn't use the garage door opener but there's it actually triggers them and their heart begins to race they want to disappear they want to stop what they're doing because the atmosphere that the father creates in the home is one of fear and trepidation why because he wants this is my castle i want to rule my domain so he makes even his own wife and children subjects more like servants than members of a household that work together and paul is saying that you have to know how to provide for care give aid in order to take care of the church of god it's a similar phrase when you look at the definition you look up take care it says to take care that's what the lexicon says but it's only used in one other place and it's used by christ in the parable of the good samaritan who is thy neighbor luke chapter 10 verses 33 to 35 catch this it says but a certain samaritan as he journeyed again we remember that this man was on his way down to jericho and he's been fallen by thieves who stripped them and left them half dead and the priest walks by and these different ones walk by and they avoid them they don't have anything to do one kind of looks like don't want to touch that but now the samaritan as he journeyed he came to where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and you could remember that it's really where it strikes me now revisiting this theme of the church's vision when we started the church we began two series in the beginning which became in the beginning god created a family through a number of services and we were doing on wednesday nights who is my neighbor and these were these two themes are just colliding this morning revisiting these things as the church has grown it says so now he says he bound him bound his wounds poured in oil and wine set him on his own beast and brought him to an end church he brought him to in and took care of him this is the only this is the one other place one of the other two places where it's used where he says take care of the church of god now this takes him to an end to take care of this member and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pens and gave them to the host brother venom likens this to the pastor and said to him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee i catch this how paul says he that rules his own house if you know how how can you if you don't know how to rule your own house care for provide give aid then how can you take care of the church of god and the only place that that's used is of an in and an innkeeper the host taking care of an individual that's been brought to the inn so we say taking care of the church of god you can't take care of the church of god and not take care of the members of the church it's not the building that we care for it's not the church order it's not the board that we're serving it's not the office of a pastor that we're serving anyone in any official capacity from song leader to musicians to deacons and trustees and pastor we're servants to the body working together at this end as servants who have been paid ahead of time and given the resources we need to minister to those that christ brings to the end that we might take care of the church of god that's the other place that the scripture is used this word is used take care of the church of god where the samaritan took care of him and then he admonished the innkeeper to take care of him now to continue this parallel i want you to catch the parallel among the family of god the house of god and your family how these things are interrelated and first corinthians chapter 16 verse 19 it says the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house so this is how churches even begin in the in the new testament as they begin around families they begin around believers who would open up their home and welcome ministry and they would gather together in these places and so he's saying these churches salute you with the church that is in uh their house or quill and priscilla salute you together with those that are in their house with the church then colossians 4 15 salute the brethren which are in laodicea and memphis and the church which is in his house so again this is another place where there's greetings being sent from a church and where they gathered in the house and philemon 1 2 and to our beloved fire and archips our fellow soldier and to the church in thy house again these greetings to flemit and the church which is in his house what paul is doing in these few greetings is he's showing that there's a connection between the church gathering and the home that it's not uh it's not something that ought to be extricated or separated but there's such a continuity in harmony between an individual's family and their participation in the church to where churches were beginning in the homes they were beginning with the families they were beginning around the tables the communion was taking place within the family in the home they didn't necessarily have to go out and rebuild they didn't have to have a hotel they didn't have to have a a temple or cathedral a church could be had and paul is saying church can be in their house i don't get any ideas i love it that you're all here but this is a connection now we're seeing a connection between church and home now this scripture to me is outstanding if you haven't written one down yet here's your chance acts chapter 8 verse 3 it says as for saul he made havoc which means to dishonor spot to ruin to defile it means to injure spot defile devastate ruin it's a it brings a dishonor so you spot something you dishonor saul made havoc of the church entering into every house and haley men and women committed them to prison so what does this scripture tell us you want to defile a church you want to weaken the church just enter the homes doesn't say paul wreaking havoc on the church entered the church you can say well brother aaron the churches were in their homes i know i just substantiated that but it wasn't just the church he entered but he entered into every house and took men and women and committed them to prison you want to weaken a church just enter the homes you want to you want to weaken a church break up the family separate the families if there's there's one thing that really burdens me is to see a family divided with one part part of the family attending one church and another one not attending another or even not going because they can't don't want to support their spouse and where they're going that's horrible that's a horrible situation to be in and that's how satan gets access to us when he breaks up family and when you break up the family when you enter in into divine and divide these things he says he wreaked havoc he made havoc of the church dishonored it and spotted it injured it and ruined it because he entered into every house and committed them to prison just bring families into bondage and the church is in havoc attendance continue to rise give can continue to rise things can seem to be thriving on the outside but do you want to know are they of one root system underneath they might look to be harmonious on the outside they might look to be a thriving church on the outside because we just kind of view them in these snapshots when they all get together on a sunday morning and maybe a wednesday night but are there families in bondage and if the families are in bondage if the families are broken if standards are being let down if things are changing in the family level and what they serve and what they live for in the relationship between the spouses and among the children if that is in bondage then listen let's not pretend the church likewise is in bondage i trust you're following me so far brother mitch did we put new batteries in this pack this morning okay i was going to suggest maybe changing them out we're on the endless quest to perfect this pack and it just might take another an investment of some sort and something different so apologize if the sound gets a little wonky at times we can blame it on the 5g let's just put that away now see he knows he's found out now or she whatever she whatever it is the 5g has been exposed now i'm going to show you a slide and it's entitled the purpose and vision of arizona believers church and this has been on our website i'm pretty sure maybe 85 of you have never heard of this before and probably didn't even know we had a website uh my family likes to troll me by saying oh you started a church in phoenix and where are you do you guys meet are there people in your church and oh you have a youtube channel oh and they not my kids but my other family they troll me all the time pretending they don't know where i'm at and i started a church and whether or not we have a website whether or not we stream but this is on the website and i'm not trolling you you can find it azbelievers.com like subscribe hit the notifications button and this is it and i've kind of summarized a little bit on the slide but in the beginning god's first masterpiece was a man and woman together as a family not a church in the beginning god didn't start a church he created a family and say therefore as a church as a local church this is our existence we exist not just to build i say not to build merely build a vibrant social community a thriving social community where everything is kind of meeting our needs socially and it's more of a social gathering that divides and breaks up afterwards or just kind of continues only along social touch points but to establish equip and encourage individuals and families in the word for today now i want you to recognize that this is a scriptural vision based upon these bible verses we shared with you that directly connects family and home to the church of god even acts chapter 8 verse 3 that satan enters into the house to bring the to wreak havoc in the church so we realize then what we have to do is strengthen the homes he says we desire true spiritual relationships be established between god and individuals by the present truth we seek to equip those individuals with the spiritual resources necessary to live an overcoming life according to god's word we strive to encourage all individuals through christ so that they may live for others that's our vision and goal and we realize these individuals is what makes up the family so we want to encourage individuals to take their part within their families and that's the purpose and vision of this church is not that people would come and serve the purpose of the church but that the church would serve those who are coming and serve their purpose and their vision and and who knows maybe in terms of church planting science that may not be a very good way of building a church but i would rather have that as the vision and have those who are coming be served and be enriched and benefited than just having a gathering that is structured in such a way to get a lot of numbers we had had this conversation with our commercial broker when we were trying to find a facility and even uh the other pastor another pastor of a church that was wanting to rent out a facility and there was this question of well how do you feel about the number of people and how do you feel about doing this and they found that these things work and this is what might work to do this and that and i just said if i was wanting to start a cult i said i would be very very strict to the science if i was just wanting to start a church they had a lot of people coming and that we we i'd be very very strict according to what um science is telling us in terms of size and number and times and length of service and all those other things you would be very in tuned to that but what i share from my heart is that the body of christ is transcendent it transcends all those markers all those influences that if we were merely just trying to build a group a gathering then we would look to group dynamics and the science of groups and the science of crowds and figure out the best way to have the best kind of services on a sunday morning and we probably wouldn't even have a midweek according to the data according to the numbers but the body of christ transcends that so we don't operate by the science we don't operate by the numbers we don't operate by the dynamics we actually are an outlier when it comes to how groups operate listen you all are outliers in terms of where you go to church because i'm pretty sure i haven't drilled down into it but i'm sure there's a gallup poll there's some statistics somewhere that tell you how far someone typically drives to go to church on sunday if they do and i'm pretty sure almost all of you except for maybe you drive further than anybody else you're like outside that zone like people don't normally drive 30 minutes to church they don't pass all these other churches to go so the body of christ transcends what's normal and natural in the world now with this vision still here i want to leave this slide up for a moment and this is where i i'm i'm burying my heart i actually wrote these things down uh just last week because i wanted to get these things on paper that were what were in my heart because i want to be very deliberate in what i share now the initial vision which has not changed was to become a church family and to build a home church a home church in name this this is my home church this is where we feel home but then it functions as one functions as a home church and we become more than just a church but a church family and because church does not replace family and it does not replace family leadership i'm very clear about this that i am nobody's spiritual husband here okay christ is your spiritual husband and and i am i am literally not spiritually i'm literally the pastor of this church so brother brother says your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking he's not saying that i am spiritually anybody's husband i am literally your pastor not spiritually speaking i'm literally speaking you're pastor of this church and i watch out over your souls as god commands me but christ is the shepherd of your souls christ is the spiritual shepherd he's the one watching over your souls and i'm a helper to him and aiding him in that process and then at the in the home i am spiritually a pastor to sister elizabeth so in your homes you husbands you are a spiritual pastor to your wife not the literal pastor but a spiritual pastor in your homes so that nobody should be looking to brother aaron as their spiritual husband and so very sensitive to that that the church and the leadership of the church does not replace family and it does not replace family leadership and with that as a conviction and these things being uh part of my uh the training that god was putting me through when god began to deal with my heart and i felt i sensed what he was calling me to do i what i basically did is i took a step back and said all right i know in the natural when you go to school you pick a major and by the time you're done you take your you take your introductory courses your foundational courses fundamental courses then you take mid-level upper level then you get your degree and the whole time you know i went to engineering school i got an engineering education i'm going to be an engineer i got my engineering degree but it's not always as obvious with sons and daughters of god because you didn't pick your trial you didn't pick your major you didn't pick your calling these are things that you have sometimes have to stop take a step back and not be so frustrated with what's transpired in your life say hold on god's had me in school so what has he been teaching me what have i been learning and if you look back and know what he's been teaching you what you've been learning it'll tell you what your calling is it'll give you some idea of how he's wanting to use you now and i looked back at what god had been teaching me and showing me in my experiences and i realized he'd been giving me a very a a a deep empathy and a sensitivity to certain things and so with that as part of my training and very conscious to me when i set out to start a church i approached cautiously in in starting the church and even in in establishing it and i was reluctant to create an environment that fostered fear i really and i know some of you might uh know exactly what i'm talking about i wanted to avoid all these common tropes that bind people to church where you're just it's just uh it's the it's fear it's pressure it's church attendance it's dangling the carrot uh it's it's it's in some ways buying buying loyalty i i just wanted to avoid all the things that sometimes work within just our human spirits and get us to kind of like i guess i'll go to church today and and i wanted to avoid that and some of you here in the beginning know that we labeled on that quite a bit or we meant we had mentioned these things and i didn't want church attendance to feel compulsory i didn't want the you know service to the church to feel like a draft like well i guess i've been drafted i got to go to clean the chalkboard or whatever i didn't want you to i didn't want it to feel like it was imposed on anybody and so i would say for the past 20 months we have made a place available for believers to come and hear the word that's the number one vision that will not change the word is first we provide a place for believers to come and hear the word and i have not wanted to be pushy or overbearing and i'm not warning you that i will now begin to get pushy or overbearing so if you stop streaming or if you stop listening at this point well brother aaron basically signaled they're gonna start to get pushing over no i want you to recognize i've been sensitive to that and so not being pushy and overbearing you can be almost to there's a downside to where you can become too hands off i don't want to be pushy but then you just you get hands off because you don't want to be pushy and then taking your hands off they don't you maybe don't feel the encouragement you don't feel the nudge and so in an effort to create a low pressure climate we can miss being welcoming we can miss being comfortable we can actually miss creating the right kind of climate and it dawned on me that you can be so careful as to not create a toxic environment that you end up with a sterile one you're so worried about not being taught you're so worried about not creating the wrong atmosphere that you never really get to creating the right one and and if i'm giving ammunition to my critics i in some ways i'm apologizing to whatever extent that it hasn't been as engaging or you're not as welcomed and you don't feel apart it's maybe been more from my complex side not wanting to be pushy but what i can say now is god has dealt with my heart over the last couple weeks we've i believe there's been a a growing stage and god is adding pieces together and i feel that we've come to a place now where i have a a definite burden that i want there to be an overt deliberate effort to foster the feeling of family amongst us and to where it has the feeling of home that resting place that quiet place the safe place the scripture uh speaks about and home has always been a part of our theme here it has always been a part of our vision when god first was speaking to me starting a church the the the inspiration was come home that there's a fold there's a fog there's a place that you belong and it was come home and uh maybe again my complex not wanting it to come across the wrong way i started with going home that our theme is the rapture wanting to go home but there is a there's always been a theme of home of making uh making this church a home a home for believers that's why it's called arizona believers church a place for people to come and feel apart and be part of a family and so now i want to be more deliberate in that vision i want to be more purposeful in that vision and and to begin to be more conscious and aware of how we can all be drawn in around the right things not around a schedule not making our schedule so busy where it's like the church has a cricket team now and i've got to go practice and i got to learn how to you know i'm the lawn dart coach and we just come up with so many things to keep you so busy that's not my vision that's not my goal because the way where that gets counterproductive we get so busy with the church family we neglect our home life we neglect our extended families and our responsibilities and obligations what i've desired to see over the last 20 months is that we come here and we get energized and we go out there and we're broadcasting the message and we win souls i'll delve into this much deeper when we talk about our family tree i won't even get to the real kernel of inspiration hopefully next sunday and you're like aaron you're always doing that but that's just my method uh that there's i want to touch on this that when coming to count there's something about counting the ones that are born there and that i really want to see our church see souls saved and birthed or delivered and restored like that's my that's my real part of my vision and that's why we're all here today is to work within god's great economy to see that souls are saved and it can be right within our own families it doesn't mean we have to go out there and start beating down the doors of the fraternity houses but it can be within our own family that we see people rescued and saved and brother so this this is where i'm coming back to that foundational quote he says he made a paradise for them as a father with his family he was called the extreme parent and so in that sense i want to on a church level commit myself to fostering and nurturing a family tree i want to commit myself to being an extreme pastor to uh to cultivate an extreme family and brother ram said that he made a paradise for them he said let there be let there be and let there be an eden let there be beautiful flowers let it be my son in my own image and stand over there in the garden of eden and let his bride stand by his side what a what a beautiful summation of creation it doesn't necessarily follow it chronologically uh and and peace break up the pieces but here he is he's using the spoken word to create an eden a beautiful place and let my son come in my image stand with his bride by his side in this garden of eden so let's examine this in genesis chapter 2 verse 8 it says the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed if anybody's keeping track how many times i use these scriptures i would like to know the score because we've used them dozens of times and dozens of sermons since we've started and i know themes are being repeated quite often but there's a it just seems that there's layers that are coming to this this is part of the fabric that god is wanting to weave together here in the outset but a garden is an enclosure it literally means an enclosure or an enclosed garden which may be another way it could say god planted an enclosed garden it comes from the root of to surround or to cover to protect so it's an enclosure and he planted a garden eastward in eden we realized by now it's been repeated quite a bit that that means my pleasure or delight so this is god's delight it was a ground or inclusion of pleasure it's what's referred to as paradise brother branham said he made a paradise for them the bible calls it a paradise revelations 2 7 he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god the paradise there means pleasure ground it could have been translated to garden but garden of eden even in different languages it's literally translated to paradise that's what kind of even in the root it has in the and the in the middle eastern languages it's speaking of a pleasure ground a park with enclosures and certain amenities and so this is god's paradise but not just god's paradise man's home it says he planted a garden and there he put the man that he had formed i could say this for adam it was literally heaven on earth because it was a paradise he had it this is where he lived and there's actually i think it's within judaism and maybe some other branches of christianity they hold paradise they're very strict on this that the idea of paradise is they believe it to be a higher realm that man lived in that he fell from so that man even living here on earth was living in a different dimension that there was another dimension just a little bit higher that he existed within and that makes a lot of sense we know that there's a paradise scripturally that empties out and there's these uh trinity above a trinity beneath there's different dimensions as we would lay them out and they believe that it was the pla paradise was between heaven and earth that's what they refer to paradise is a realm and a dimension between heaven and earth what a beautiful blending together probably that overlap that venn diagram of heaven and earth and that's where adam and the woman lived in the garden of eden that's what paradise was and that's what they fell from in the masterpiece brother bram says this masterpiece was walled by the word it was a masterpiece family is what he calls it and the masterpiece itself of the family remember the masterpiece was not just adam the masterpiece was the family and it was fortified by his word and it was enclosed by his word covered by his word that's the garden and man is a part of this paradise man i said how beautiful it is the flowers the eden the paradise in the garden of eden with his bride by his side just reading this quick statement i believe i have i don't have it on a slight says what what it was at the beginning when god put adam and eve in the garden that beautiful paradise without death without sickness without sorrow and everything perfect in order power of transformation says we find everything in order what is this image of what is this what is this a picture of what is god portraying in this image now of the garden and i want to let me just ponder how to express this i want you to there's a vision that's being expressed we're having we're looking back to genesis but then we know it looks there's a looking forward too and this is a very necessary foundation as i said in the beginning i want christ to be at the center of this but then i want you to see how man how our there's an image of us that starts to kind of come into this picture now we just read that god planted a garden east with eden that's his delight that's his pleasure it's a paradise he put the man that he had formed in this eden but look at verse 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul now that's a very curious description but we know that man was first made spiritual supernatural and that this part is the flesh which we inhabit now this physical body and he says he formed him from the dust of the ground now what an incredible image because we see elsewhere where god forms the beast from the ground and so we see that seeds are coming forth from the ground all nature's coming forth from the soil it's coming forth from mother earth as it was he says he formed man of the dust of the ground not just in that moment speaking the word and things coming together in the ether or something not seen but it's known that the spoken word earth this ground that came by the spoken word of god god took certain elements and he began to form man up we say dust to the ground he's taking him from the clay he's taken him from the earth he's taking him from the mud i know that we might think dust and we're thinking hmm right we're just thinking maybe just particles or something but it's the image of dirt he's forming him from the earth from the soil brings us to being rooted and grounded in love a question and answers on genesis brother brandon give such a beautiful remarkable description of this he says and ben but then there was no man to till the soil so there's the impetus for putting him in flesh and it's no man to till the soil so he takes man from the very thing he's going to attend that remarkable no man to till the soul and when god formed man genesis 2 7 this is a quote here out of the dust of the earth now we follow it he formed man out of the dust of the earth and put his supernatural spirit now he was laying there i have many pictures of it and and and when i'm thinking he says i have many pictures of it i don't know if he's talking about literal pictures that he's researched or if it's in his this prophetic mind but now this one he says i can see so watch this prophetic vision i can see adam standing let's take it this way see him standing like a tree god had made him and he was dead as he could be his toes like the roots sticking in the ground you recognize what god has just done according to this prophetic vision is he has brother ram sees adam being grown formed from the dust of the earth and as he looks at him before life comes into him he sees him as a tree where his toes are his roots in the dirt and he's standing up like a tree sticking in the ground so he's setting forth man as a tree god said let there be and breathe the breath of life into him and he jumped and came to himself breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living soul now he begin to move on move on why because initially man in his flesh is represented as a tree and he says i see him standing there toes standing like a tree and he's dead as he could be but his toes are roots in the earth can you just picture that in your mind listen i think we've watched enough youtube videos and movies to be able to picture adam as a trunk and a tree and his toes in the mud and this dirt and he's standing there lifeless and then god speaks and the tree comes to life does not psalms 1 teach us that a man is like a tree planted by the rivers of water was it's a type now we covered this in detail and just even mentioned it in our motherhood sermon in genesis chapter 2 verse 22 adam is even in the image of the tree as he comes forth and god says he planted a garden and put man in the garden so it's like a tree also now as man and type formed from the dust of the ground placed there in the garden and then when it comes to the woman god has said in genesis chapter 1 verse 11 let each seed bring forth of its kind so there has to be a tree yielding seed after its kind it has to be of the same tree so when god goes to form the woman he does not create again but he takes the adam tree and he says and the rib which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man remember rib is the side or chamber but it's literally translated to beam it means a beam like a a plank of wood it's translated that very word rib is trying to boards of cedar and planks of fur in the temple boards of cedar rib of cedar is purity rib of fur nobility in the description i think it's first king six it's describing and using rib to describe the wooden elements of cedar and fur within the temple and so again in type adam is a tree and god has taken a material from that tree a seed from that tree he's taking something off of that tree that rib to build a woman and she is now of the same tree and brother graham says in marriage and divorce well the woman is the tree she is the fruit tree you're the fruit of your mother the fruit of the womb is you so now man is a tree and the woman having come from adam she is also typed to a tree in type the the this is the it's a representation now in verse nine i know we're kind of skipping around so brother aaron you need to learn to read your bible 789 not 879 but here we are genesis 2 9 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food so if it grew from the ground and it's growing from the ground and you can see it then it's good for food it's pleasant to the site the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil remember these are symbols these are types brother bam says in the writes in the church age book we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden it says right here the tree of life in the midst and the tree of knowledge of good and evil the tree of life was jesus the other tree is definitely satan because of what come forth of the fruit of that tree we're just reading it from the message of the hour from the church age book the tree of life was jesus the other tree is definitely satan but then man and woman are also in type trees but they're not these trees according to this statement the tree of life is christ three of knowledge of good and evil satan you'll recognize symbolically how he plays this out he says now then listen to how important this is we both we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of god in the relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto god so he places these trees there the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and they have some relationship to man and they have some part in the sovereign plan and purpose of god and a relationship not just to man but some relationship to god himself or otherwise god didn't know what he was doing when he did this the parrot message paradox between all know that christ is that tree of life so christ is represented in this tree of life christ himself is foreshadowed in scripture as being a tree in song of solomon 2 3 as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so here's an apple tree among the other trees and the forest so is my beloved among the suns i saw i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste here's christ being represented as an apple tree who provides a shadow who provides fruit christ is represented as fruit a fruit tree and a shade tree this is speaking of christ because christ is the tree of life this is the image of christ as a tree of fruit tree now you have adam and the woman typed as trees tree of life tree of knowledge of good and evil now when the serpent approaches the woman what's this conversation about trees god's god did god not say you shall eat you shall not eat of every tree of the garden in genesis 3 1 this is the conversation now immediately comes to the trees and the fruit of the trees and this is contrary to genesis 2 17 where god said but of the tree of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat because the day you eat that day you die but now the serpent wants to bring the this tree and to view these trees into view and is everybody staying with me are you guys staying with me so far i don't i don't think it's um too too long or too hot at this point so i think we're we should be good to finish and the sermon what shall i do with jesus i could labor on that but i want just to get that in your thought that the serpent now this the subtle beast of the field comes to the woman and he starts the conversations about tree to get her to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and says in the sermon what shall i do with jesus it says the same christ that tree that was in the garden of eden that eve left eating off of this tree of life to take the tree of wisdom she left the tree of life to take the tree of death so this is what the woman does in the beginning her even herself being a plank or beam or the wood of purity the wood of nobility that came forth from adam here she stands with sacred virtues that she must protect but now she has mingled herself and she chooses the tree of death instead of the tree of life in marriage and divorce where brother graham said the woman is like a tree he says and he says you're the fruit of the womb as you he continues this is in the fruit of the tree of life that was in the garden of eden is christ the fruit of the tree of life that was in the garden of eden is christ so it's the tree of life back again through the woman come death through the man capital m in the original creation come life through adam all men die through christ we are made alive and so the fruit of the christ is represented as the tree of life as the fruit coming to you know the the the tree of life coming back again the man in the original creation come he brought life now in type and i know we addressed this um at the outset when we ministered on this in the beginning that when satan comes to the woman as the tree of knowledge of good and evil when she falls in sin satan caused a hybrid tree because now it's the wrong family tree it doesn't make it the continuity is broken you have the the the extreme parent with his son and daughter as a family on earth and there to multiply and replicity of god at the top and the way they would maybe diagram this is you have got at the top and then it would just it was to branch out and it would all be under that but when the woman does what she does it bran it takes and it creates a whole separate tree it's gone into a whole separate heading a whole separate headship you wouldn't you wouldn't even begin to chart them together because now she's left the headship and it creates a totally different tree and she violated that the commandment that trees are to yield genesis 11 are to yield fruit after its kind so it's already speaking in type to the man and the woman that it has to be after your kind and so when they violate genesis 2 17 the tree which is wood pieces timber and these are even in the meaning of tree it means plank or building materials pieces of wood a tree was good the tree or pieces of wood of good and evil you see what took place the tree of knowledge and good and evil was to take good and to take things that were not harmonious with we say evil it's not necessarily we have to kind of keep in our mind he didn't take like something clean and then take a crack pipe and smuggle it into eve's uh backpack it was he took things that ought not to mix and in doing who took good and when it mingled then you're mixing pieces of wood you're you're you're gendering things that are different and he says it and what i'm wanting to express then in this as we see this tree image he mixed the family tree so in genesis 3 15. in genesis 3 15 in the curse he says i will put enmity between thee and the woman and thy seed which is zera it's the offspring it's the seed that's even mentioned and which talk about each seed bringing forth of its kind and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is prophecy of another tree just as brother adam said it's the fruit of the tree of life that was in the garden of eden is christ this is a redemption of the family tree that's chopped down in eden so one of the most outstanding prophecies of christ is in isaiah chapter 11 verse 1. the seed of the woman her seed is going to be the tree of life brought back again it's the fruit of the tree of life in the garden of eden so when they prophesied of christ in isaiah 11 1 and it said there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and the branch shall grow out of his roots so a rod a branch or limb out of the stem or stump of jesse which the stump implies something cut close down to the roots a rod shall shoot out of the stump of jesse something cut down to the roots a branch shall grow out of his roots a branch of sprouter shoot it grow to bear to be fruitful to branch off to be fruitful and multiply a branch shall be fruitful what is he depicting he's depicting a family tree and christ is the branch zechariah 6 12 zechariah 3 8 or so it refers to the servant shall be the branch behold zechariah 6 12. behold the man whose name is the branch so christ is this branch this rod that's going to come from something cut down the stump of jesse is going to sprout forth and it's actually depicting a family tree and so this is taken from a book over a thousand years old in this rendering of these scriptures that you have on the on the left side you can see that there's a branch draw growing from the stomach of jesse and then it continues it's on the next page and they have these scriptures and these remarks coming underneath i could have provided the whole page but it was just i would i don't think it would have given you the context but then the next one is david playing the harp and you can see that he thou it's represented now this branch is growing and it has a son nathan you can see that it's described there in the circle as nathan and the scriptures describing what we call today in modern parlance a family tree and even here in isaiah 11 the tree is being used as a symbol of lineage and genealogy because i'm going to take the stump of jesse but i'm going to cause another shoot i'm going to cause a branch to come out that's going to be fruitful and multiply and it's the very christ is now being used as the beginning of another tree in revelations chapter 22 verse 16 let's carry this forward now to in revelations chapter 22 verse 16. if you recall i i don't know if we did it in great detail and i've pondered maybe doing this showing how that the first three chapters of the bible have these incredible connections to the last three chapters of the bible there's things mentioned in the beginning that are mirrored in the end and there's reverse things happening and it's very remarkable how what happens in the seed chapter it's come to perfection and manifested and perfected in the last three so in revelations chapter 22 verse 16 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these unto you these things and the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star the root that's the original seed the root the gene i am the source if you're the root you're the source of life the pando comes from one single root system one single root therefore everything that comes from it i am the vine you're the branches everything that comes from it is genetically identical did a supernatural dna test the new birth provides genetically uh identical offspring of god that's why he has no grandchildren so he says i'm the root now this is where it kind of gets a little interesting i'm the offspring so not only am i the original seed but i'm the expression i'm not only the gene but i'm the genos the kind i'm the species i'm the expression that comes after it now i'll just say state the obvious this is a paradox how can he be both the root but then also the fruit of david he can't be a literal family tree you can't be the root of david the family the tree that david comes from but then be the offspring of david that wouldn't make sense chronologically but watch how brother branham begins to tie these things in because this is at the very end of the bible bible says writes the church the tree of life isn't that a beautiful figure of speech it is mentioned three times in the book of genesis and three times in the book of revelation and in all six places it is the same tree and symbolizes exactly the same thing catches that he catches the three times in genesis the three times in the book of revelation we've already read some of these and he's saying that there's a symmetry there there's a connection it's the same tree symbolizes exactly the same thing so in genesis chapter 3 verses 22 to 24 this is some of these instances it's mentioned and lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil where'd that come from the tree of knowledge of good and evil now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever we've already read in genesis 2 9 that was the first instance now he says take of the tree of life and eat and live forever there's a second instance therefore god sent him forth from the garden of eden what's happening he's been pushed out to till the ground from whence he was taken the man is a tree taken from the ground he's gonna have to go kill the ground from which he was taken in this very moment paradise is lost it's at this moment that he's been driven out away from the tree of life but what do we read in revelations 21 paradise restored a garden of god the river running through it the tree of life being there it's paradise restored so in verse 24 you see the third time it's mentioned so he drove out the man and placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life it's the third time that's mentioned that now in genesis 3 they're barred from the tree of life but in revelations 22 as brother bannon brings out the symmetry it says verse 14 blessed are they that do his commandments which adam and eve didn't so blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city just as the way was closed off and guarded by this flaming sword now notice in the end in revelations 22 that there's those that have a right to the tree of life closed off paradise paradise lost in genesis 3 paradise restored in revelation 21 now the tree of life being restored back in the garden of god in that eighth day that you may enter back into this now again i know these are a lot of details and i may not be connecting them just exactly together right now but this is sometimes what you see what's really neat sometimes you watch a mason or whatever they put i'm not pretending to be amazing but just put everything together and you're like well those don't all connect but then they just put that mortar over it this is the way they wash over it the way that all of a sudden everything's just seamless and i'm and and hopefully the holy spirit can do that part for you and genesis chapter 17 verses excuse me genesis chapter 3 verses 17 to 19. very very near my clothes here making but much better time than i thought i would genesis chapter 3 verses 17 to 19. now this is the curse to adam and i want to amplify this in more detail in the future lord willing at least i want to and says and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded he saying thou shalt not eat of it remember the serpent is cursed the woman is cursed but now adam the the the one taken from the ground he's not directly cursed but says cursed is the ground for thy sake but remember it's the ground that he came out of and the ground that he's going to have to till according to genesis 2 23 or 3 23 so now cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground from out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou i return i i do want to amplify this further in the future but let me just try to articulate it this way adam could not be mingled adam's spirit could be muddied up and adam's could those channels could become clogged and that he that image of that image of god leave him but adam having already been made in the image of god there was a way that he was already formed and expressed to where he couldn't be unborn and then born again and regenerated and defiled here's adam as coming straight from god as a son now thrust into a foreign element to now fallen but yet he's a son of god in a fallen condition so god is portraying something very very remarkable in these verses where he curses the ground for thy sake what was cursed the soil adam is not cursed directly but the soil is cursed and he says that soil is going to bring forth thorns and thistles so what is god portraying adam you're going to fight with the earth all the days of your fight with thorns and thistles and you're gonna have to eat of it and he's speaking to adam's life but in adam's curse he's foreshadowing the curse that has come upon flesh because of the mingling because now this body that would have never brought forth a thorn has been mixed with another tree that in the mixing produces our thorny nature our thistles and our prickly sinful nature so he's foreshadowing the fallen human nature in this curse to adam adam is not cursed directly but the fallout of the original sin is going to produce a nature that is between according to satan's desire and his design and there's going to be a tree that doesn't bring forth the perfect fruit but it can put forth thorns and that's the curse that's the curse that's falling on all mankind so in galatians 3 13 it says christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us now christ has redeemed us from the curse how for it is written cursed as every one that hangeth on a tree even in the image of christ the tree of life being crucified on another shows us the very image of the original sin is being atoned for the tree of life hanging on a dead wood hanging on a tree that man is cut down here's the tree of life hanging on another cross hanging on another tree cursed is everyone that hangeth on the treats from deuteronomy 20 or 21 curses everyone that hangeth on a tree and here's christ hanging on that tree what is it it's christ the tree of life redeeming us from the curse of the mixed tree redeeming us from the curse of the ground that produces mixed fruit mixed trees mixed natures he redeemed us from the curse so we read it in our text in the beginning in revelations 22 2-3 in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 manners of fruit and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree before the healing of the nations and there shall be no more curse why because the tree of life hung upon a tree and was made a curse for us therefore this curse of genesis 3 17 is gone but the throne of god on the lamb shall be in it and his servant shall serve him because christ is that apple tree christ is the tree of life christ is likened unto a tree we could even see him in type in luke chapter 13 verses 18 to 19. should i take a poll are you okay sister eliza you okay brother jack everybody staying with me i really feel like i'm close to stopping very close the harder you pull the louder you a man i might just quit is that the wrong kind of reverse psychology you get all the real word lovers going i'm gonna shut up but just let's just enter into this i'm i'm wanting to just have a climax with this just being very patient and prodding in this because i really do believe it just comes to a real beautiful place and we'll just leave it there but look in luke chapter 13 verses 18 to 19. it says then notice this parable then he said it said he under what is the kingdom of god like so now the kingdom of god in this parable and where shall i resemble it it is like a grain of mustard seed remember faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed is power to move mountains so now this that parallel to faith it is like a grain of mustard seed which would be the the seed of a mustard tree which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls are there lodged in the branches of it christ is this great tree the seed that is sewn into the ground the seed of faith cast into the garden but when it grows it waxes a great tree let me say this this is our family tree this is not a family tree that has an earthly name attached to it this is not a family tree that honors a family legacy it is the tree of life it is christ and as it says that birds lodged in it and it whacks great this is our refuge this is the tree that we're a part of brother brahman the sermon investment says and that great tree that great tree of life when he come on earth they chopped it down did you catch that the tree of life now we said the cross that was a tree chopped down and fashioned into a cross we see the serpent chop down to go up on the ground and so we could see then the out the thing the tree of knowledge of good evil that was working on the serpent it's chopped down uh the woman you see all these images of trees right it's just a theme to get you to see something and now christ is the tree of life he's that apple tree and song of solomon he is he you say he's this mustard tree in type he's the tree of life he's this great tree and he's chopped down i'm using the language of brother branham he's a tree the great tree of life chopped down and hung up by a roman spear remember john 12 24 unless a corner of wheat fallen to the ground and die it abideth alone so now he he expresses that that this tree this corn has got to be chopped down it has to be buried it has to be planted but what's going to grow back wax a great tree all from what one seed one seed one root a living organism genetically identical trees sprouting up and growing so he says chopped down by a roman spear and hung on a roman tree a cruel cursed tree but in there he redeemed a bride tree the bride tree one just like him that eve tree from the garden of eden that tree that had fallen eve in the beginning and adam walked out with her now adam comes with the second adam comes knowing that he had his eyes open to come to receive his eve just as adam the first adam walked out with the fallen tree now comes the tree of life and he's willingly chopped down to do what bring back the bride tree just as the rib was taken from adam tree and it produced a woman a man and a woman as trees and they never fulfilled god's command christ the tree of life is chopped down to do what bring forth another genetically identical tree the bride tree that's what i when i saw it in the scripture last week i just i wanted to do some sprints but i'm adverse to exercise and it says in luke chapter 23 verses 42 and 43 if you could catch this do i have those scriptures in there brother john i thought i had him in there there there he says and he said unto jesus look at that now i have to set this up i'm getting too excited he's hanging on the cross he's between two malefactors two thieves and the one on the left is railing at him right he he he said uh if you're the son of god do this and do that here they're all hanging on a tree hey well if you're the if you could do this you know you should do something but then the one on the right he he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest and do thy kingdom and notice what jesus says you want to know this is where we see the tree of life hanging hanging on that cross being chopped down and he says verily i said to thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise what was being consecrated on that cross what way was being made on that cross that he could sit there and say to the thief on his right when with this tree of life is cut down sacrifices made the bloody lamb of genesis 3 has come into fulfillment the the the seed of the woman in genesis 3 15 is hanging on the cross the tree of life has come back again and it's being split open and now though you're a thief in the image of fallen man paradise is being restored the tree of life has made a way again unless we not catch the significance of it in the time that we're living in and the day that we're living in right now and i meant to provide the picture and i apologize but we're familiar with the hoffman's head of christ it's it's taken from a larger picture hoffman's rich young ruler painting and in the the meeting of christ and the rich young ruler christ is looking to his left to the rich young ruler who's rejecting christ and so in the original hoffman's head of christ and the rich young there's a meeting with one who comes face to face with christ and rejects the opportunity to eternal life a meeting with the tree of life and he turns away rejecting and the thief on the cross it was a thief on the left that turned against him but when he appeared in the cloud today when he came in our time he's not looking to his left he's looking to his right because to the left the rich young ruler was rejected to the left the the thief on the cross rejected him but now he's looking to the right where he pardoned the thief on the cross and said this day you'll be with me in paradise this is his face this is representing something to us revelations 22 4 and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads what does it tell us here we are in the end restore back to the garden of god back to the paradise again on the doorstep of a complete transformation into an eighth day he brings it to christ let me just read this in closing musicians if he could come and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed which would be a mixed tree mixture of woods right he's the seed the woman seed the tree of life in the garden i took just a little bit out just for brevity says and he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever his word is life and that would be the word then the word of god which eve turn down in the garden of eden then here is christ the word made manifest and when he come on earth he was the tree of life and rome what did they do he had chopped he had to be chopped down the tree of life christ chopped down and raised up a curse he's chopped down he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on a tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth the bride tree and what is the what is the bride tree this is his definition of a bright tree which will be the tree of life the bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden by the same word the same god made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again what is it genetically identical what i wanted to emphasize today in this was that christ is our family tree [Music] only in christ that this makes sense this is not this is not a memorial to any kind of movement of man it's not a cult of personality it's in recognition it's it's a meeting of christ a coming together i i shared that instance of the cloud because i believe it's significant i believe it's absolutely significant the continuity with scripture what was expressed in the king's countenance there's life my son jack last week was in service and they were playing a slideshow and in the slideshow there came up a the cloud and jack leaned over to his sister listen he says mom what is that and she said oh that's the that's a picture that was a cloud that was in the sky and it's in the shape and outline of the head of christ and jack says he said i can't remember just exactly he says mom all i know is i feel like that cloud is my life when christ who is our life shall appear in the light of the king's countenance there is life and just a seven-year-old boy a good number seven he's he's seen this as i feel that in this is life this is my life this is not a trivial thing i've been pondering uh to to a great extent here recently that you don't have to lie about the message to reject it be honest with it be honest with the message there's things brother venom taught we don't need to try to change it massage it and reject it because of this and that and try to re-cobble together the message with all of our removing all the continuity errors and removing all what we think is it can't be exactly explained this way and this doesn't make sense take it as it is and if you can't just take it as it is walk away from it nobody's forcing you to do this but if you're like no i feel forced to do this then just take it as it is take it as god has expressed it people reject it by their own analysis and reason and they can't they can't digest it and and that's that's absolutely fine my objection is when you lie about it and you try to change what he taught to change his personality change his person to reject it there's enough there to work off of where if you don't believe that's bible you have every right to walk away god forbid that we don't just try to go through and change it so we can have an excuse to stay all right who needed that we're one we're this is our family tree and i i trust that next time we can get into getting this in greater detail because oh i'm just thrilled i'm so excited and what are we what are we expressing a vision of the church vision for your family and what did we see in revelations 22 vision of home let's stand today
