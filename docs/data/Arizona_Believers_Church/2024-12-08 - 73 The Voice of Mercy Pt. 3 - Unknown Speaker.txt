TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is a remarkable uh scripture reading it's one that uh is of great substance and weight to Believers to Christians it's one that uh I think has been the subject of a lot of inquiry and even uh opinions and establishments as the Catholic Church would take this and Empower priest with the ability to forgive sins and place it all in the church uh the Catholic church and their system and different ways of looking at this in the in the word and uh drawing things from it but I believe there's something really profound in what Jesus says here and I hope that it can become uh a little bit more clear to us according to the word of God and how this is a a way to Mercy and how God is speaking about uh sins being remitted which is the image of what the sacrifices were to do and what that Hol Most Holy place was to represent in those stripes of blood so those are uh the tie-ins to this particular scripture and as we've been looking at the house of the Lord and the voice of Mercy uh we know that the house of the Lord uh the the most holy place was that Mercy Seat that place that held the mercy seat and in there was God's throne and The Mercy Seat and that's that the most important part of the house of the Lord people trying to decipher my my slide as you provide me art that's inspired by my sermons I will use them in a slideshow so I want to encourage everybody to participate and on Calvary now we're going to fast forward to Pastor the bearded snake uh with the hat uh that then it said that God dwells on The Mercy Seat is what that caption said above that but on Calvary there's Jesus Christ and what was he brother Brandon clearly identifying this that was The Mercy Seat um The Throne of mercy and a throne of judgment in plain view as Christ is hanging there on the cross and so Luke 23:34 as Jesus is hanging there on the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do what is that that him interceding over the ignorance of the very ones who are crucifying him and so there's this season where they're crucifying the word they're crucifying the word made flesh they're crucifying Jesus Christ and there's this season where he's saying oh Father forgive them because they're ignorant and what was it that Peter said on the day of Pentecost he said repent as he preached that sermon he says you've crucified the Lord Of Glory and he interceded for your ignorance but now men are being commanded to repent and then in verse 43 as he's hanging there on the cross it says uh he's speaking to the thief who said Lord remember me he said verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise what is this reconciliation what is this act of The Mercy Seat it was imparting eternal life by what Authority by by what power CU you could even say the atonement hadn't fully been accomplished he hadn't presented himself into heaven yet as the sacrifice of fulfilling all shadows and types he hasn't resurrected yet but yet this is the word with authority with power and he says today shalt thou be with me in Paradise affirming the Covenant with h the Seed of Abraham and with these Old Testament Saints and we see that Christ is pleading for Mercy for those who are ignorant but then also granting life to those who see him and recognize him as he is and we saw how this was patterned in Acts how that Paul says himself that I obtained Mercy in my ignorance but then there is a Paul is recognizing his ignorance and realizes though he was a blasphemer and injurious he obtained mercy and yet we see Peter demanding repentance so there's a point at which it just kind of flips where there's Mercy for the ignorant but then there's this Tipping Point where you have to repent and you can't you can't kind of slide back into ignorance again I mean there's really a lot that uh sometimes we just wish we didn't know don't tell me I don't want to know cuz we realize that once you know you're accountable and and that was something I really appreciated at uh brother Mike Patterson's Memorial where he shared something it was shared that he said that whenever you inform somebody this was something he taught whenever you tell somebody the truth they're accountable for it and so there's a season where you are in ignorance and there's a mercy there because you do do so ignorantly but then there's a Tipping Point that once you know the only the only Escape is to repent or to accept and to acknowledge and so the Bible says in Acts 17:30 in the times of this ignorance God winked at there was a time when he wasn't uh he wasn't punishing there wasn't a line that was crossed but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent both Jew and Gentile Gentiles could always CLA well we have no idea what you're talking about but now God was revealed himself to them and so Paul had to repent as the gospels preach to Gentiles they were being held accountable they said well we didn't have a god appear to us on the mountain we didn't it was now they had to accept Christ and brother Bram says in the unveiling of God brother sister that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and brought God into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it could it be possible that the Gentiles have done the same thing in this hour in this day in this time he said it was Jesus Christ hanging on the cross The Mercy Seat and what was it the people were too blind to see it now it's repeated again their Traditions so there's the he says could it be possible that they've done the same thing and he's saying that's exactly what they've done and so we see those things even more pronounced in the sermon the indictment how they are crucifying Jesus Christ again and they're guilty right so he says the whole Mercy Seat is setting in plain view anybody can see it the veil is rent glory to God the whole Mercy Seat comes into Plain View he's not speaking historically he's speaking presently how could God have mercy on foul Sinners as us when he he hid himself was a mystery and now it's in plain view or in full view revealed by his word it is always it it's always the word constantly that is God it's the word that opens it up we know that Jesus Christ is the Living Word that brings God present and so as God was above them in the Old Testament and blessing them in the Old Testament and he was there uh declared himself with them but now we recognize that he was God in flesh God dwelling among them Jesus Christ The Living Word making God present among them and so here he's saying in our day it's the revealed word it's Jesus Christ The Living Word making God present and then in his presence there's where our Mercy is in receiving that and accepting that that's where Mercy is but to reject that is Judgment the world isn't going to look at God and say you're a phony you're a fake and if you're real you're just a narcissist and you're evil and you're the epitome of evil and we don't want you and God still like you come here you cute little grumpy guy now God's going to say that was your chance right you're rejecting truth you're rejecting the word you're rejecting Christ and that's judgment and so brother Brandon when he's preaching this the unveiling of God and he says the word is in plain view it's opened up he says it was tore open for a purpose now that's the that's the key there it's not so much okay yeah it's happened but why why is it made plain today so today The Mercy Seat Christ is here here being revealed and the only hope is to repent is it to repent and call the name of William brandom nope that would that's just as wrong as anything else but it's Christ the word take the full word of God into your heart just take it into your heart as it opens up hold fast to it become it that's what we to do is hold fast to this word that opens up to us and say Lord uh this is I'm going to not let go of this this is the truth now in Revelations chap 3 : 19 and 20 this is a scripture uh of the L Dean age and so his brother B says the mercy seats in plain view it's fully opened up and it's repeated again how there's blindness a and there's holding to traditions and through those traditions and the exercise of ceremony and all these outward things people take great comfort in that and in being behind those things they could be well we're fine as long as it looks good as long as we get results and it's their Traditions that they're blinded by but yet they're naked miserable poor so there's counsel given and here is this uh final call to the church as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent and I'm wanting you to recognize this in the hour and the time that God is revealing himself to the Gentiles and here's this climax of the church ages the climax of The Gentile dispensation and once again The Mercy Seat is in plain view by the revealed word he's making himself known own and this this is a scripture that exist in that time that's relevant and given at that time be zealous therefore and repent see the parallels to uh that day on Calvary and that season of the church coming into its uh into into existence behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into to him and will suck with him and he with me Christ is now on the outside of the church he's been kicked out of the church he's no longer in the church he's no longer in the midst of all these uh uh the season of uh uh tearing down and building up and Reformation this is a different season uh he's interceded through the church ages but now he's knocking and what is he doing he's this reconciliation this final climactic piece of Redemption full Redemption and there's rebuke and chastening and we've already covered these uh two principles quite a bit this year on these things so he says be zealous therefore and repent and to be zealous is to desire earnestly to strive after busy oneself with and so it's to repent of this L toy and condition repent of your ignorance you're blind miserable poor naked wretched and so he's saying these are the things that you should do I counsel you to do these things and so you've got to repent of your error amen repent of your ways if a blind man thought he could see he's probably not going to say forgive me for being blind he's still in his ignorance so there's got to be he says uh I I've rebuked you I've chastened you you've heard my word you've heard my voice you can either choose to stay in ignorance and ignorance isn't going to be any appeal before the Judgment throne but now especially since you've been told you've been rebuked you've been chasen and now he says be zealous and repent and as it says in verse 20 to me the Zeal now is projected towards this uh seek and find him who's outside of the church who's calling you to receive him I've rebuked you I've chasen you be zealous therefore and repent CU behold I'm knocking on the door of your heart I'm speaking these things to you to reveal these things to disclose these things so I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice I will come into him now isn't that an interesting phrase I know that we read it I will come in to him but the phrase the word that is used is I will come and it's not uh in the original it gives this image of not just arriving uh in a place where someone is but it's actually this entrance into a condition or a state to come the word to come is to arise or to be to come into existence I will come in him it it speaks of to come into life when you say you come the word that would be used is to come before the public and then it's also used of thoughts that would come into the mind so this word come is very important uh it has different meanings but I want you to recognize it this way I will come and not so much be present with him but I'm going to come to life in him I'm going to appear to him I'm going to make myself known and I'm going to be the one that's present with him bringing things to mind animating him and moving him I will come in to him it speaks of a union and he says and I will Su with him we uh how many people here say dinner for lunch amen yeah there's different in supper and we get those confused and so I just like to eat dunch don't want any confusion here but there it's a supp it speaks of a supper Feast it is the meal it's a formal meal that is held at the evening time to Su this Feast this word this evening time Feast it's used of the messiah's feast this is an evening time Feast with the bride I I I like to point this out when I look at this scripture it's not a snack not a snack but this is a feast as brother Barry would say they'd be putting on the dog and so in the seed is not air with the shuck and I've been studying these things for the uh just have a few Services maybe for the end of the year might kind of revolve around a holiday theme in the Christmas time and so I've been looking at this idea of of this supping with him eating with him in the evening time and he says neither will a Christian eat on the dead caran from old denominational doctrines and things so the difference between a vulture a crow and a dove they eat on or even an eagle it's not going to eat on the dead things a Christian will not eat on the dead things they want the word of God fresh the promise of the hour he says God promised rabbits in the day of Lu Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now the promised us he promised us a full Square meal the full seven course menu for all the seals are opened and everything is ready for the word of God to those who can receive now there's those who have not yet received there's those that still would even wrestle with this particular statement that all seven seals are opened and everything is ready to those who can receive it and what is it opened up to us a full seven course menu It's the evening time Feast of the bride with the word even for shadowing that wedding supper in the sky because there's going to be a change in a translation and the wedding supper is after the union I will come into him I'm going to unite myself with my Gentile bride I will be present with them in this uniting time and there's going to be the spiritual Feast so Christ has revealed himself to the elect to Feast to commune and this sub this communion it's also to empower to command amen we see an image of this in Revelations 10: 8 and9 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth little did John know that he was going for a feast he says and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up so there is this progressive revelation of the book being opened go take the book it symbolizing some connection or ownership to it asking for it and saying being told you take it and I don't want you just to take it this is a further revelation of this audience with Jesus Christ there a further command take it and eat it up amen there's a a a taking of the book there's a feasting in this end time that the believer undergoes that the believer does and it's feasting in his presence now I I've tried to break down these scriptures be zealous there and repent behold I stand at the door and knock if you hear my voice let me come into you open up open up your heart let me come into you for this uniting time for this feasting time for this Fellowship this commandment and communion and I want to draw from his first coming and his resurrection to see a type or a shadow and we know those things literally happened but God is known by his characteristics and there's ways that we see these scriptures now and and these symbols being used and we can go back and see a literal happening in the in his first coming and his crucifixion and Resurrection uh because he's it's happened again today what happened then is repeated today and so in John chapter 20 I'm to be reading verses 19 to 23 but we'll I've got a um a scripture reading kind of in the middle so if you're taking notes I will be getting to verse 23 uh but uh we'll be reading from Luke 24 the similar happening in Luke 24 just to get the full picture so then the same day at evening being the first day of the week this is the day of the Resurrection it was a time of a crucifixion a time of death a time of fear a time of Darkness but joy came in the morning his mercies are renewed in the morning and here is a Resurrection on Resurrection morning so to the world there is a setting sun it's death it's Darkness but to the bride Shalom good morning it is the rising of the Sun so there is a the doors were shut I just think this is such a beautiful picture behold I stand at the door and knock and so it's to give this idea of one design iring entrance so here uh the disciples the doors were shut and the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews doors are shut they're in this private place they're in this secret place they're shut out from the outside and the doors being shut came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them and I I read in a commentary one time where it said the the way the scriptures phrased is to convey that Jesus didn't enter by ordinary means in other words the doors were shut and they didn't open open he didn't climb through a window he didn't descend down through the roof he didn't all of a sudden like throw up the the covers on the bed and say surprise but he appeared he came through the wall so to speak he appeared so he came in a way that was uh not normal or ordinary and he stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you and there maybe not an immediate recognition right even when Jesus came walking on the water and they're like oh he said come to me it's a ghost and what is this there's this fear and when he had said so he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord and we realize as we've already referenced from the unveiling of God if we could get the full picture of what had transpired uh from that prior week to the first day of the week the uh death burial now the Resurrection The Mercy Seat had been hanging in plain view their tradition s had ceased they had been exposed as bloodless there was no presence of God behind the veil in the temple The Mercy Seat had been hanging in plain view what was that the rejected Christ the word but now he's risen and the disciples so in the season of the word coming and being revealed rejected crucified but resurrected and present so it's not a dead Christ it's not a dead word the disciples those that followed him those that believed him were assembled Behind These closed doors they're they're separated from the word rejecting world they're separated from all the accusers and the crucifiers and they're gathered together and here they're gathered in fear and it's in in this time that Christ comes and makes himself known to them now and I'm wanting you to uh and I just ask God to help me today I want you to see this image as what we're facing yet today Christ wanted to make self known been veiled by so many Traditions a a and so many falsities and uh and so much of handling the word of God and unrighteousness and when I say this don't just think Catholic or Lutheran or Protestant you should think of all of them that name the name of Christ even those who've been associated with the message of the hour now I'm not going to say they're guilty we're all guilty of not accurately portraying the truth and so we ask God constantly for mercy and Grace in these things to be faithful to Christ and and and one thing I've been been really uh wrestling with lately is to fully understand because I think maybe it comes from this standpoint I'm maybe backing up and sharing uh something that is in my uh the process of laboring to find the mind of the Lord there's a lot of things I keep repeating there's a lot of things we keep looking at and I realized it's because I feel that there's a premise that we need to understand for all things that we don't always have to keep revisiting it but once we understand the premise then it's to give everything else to make sense like well why does this happen why does that happen why ises this why because there's this premise and if I could say it this way denominationalism had so covered up the word of God and it so chopped up the Bible in Christ into so many different pieces that the premise of the message of the hour is to bring us back to the truth of Christ in the word of God and and and in that then there becomes a wholeness to the truth that that's where you've got to be but if you try to hold in your denominations in organizations God's left that you've got to come back to the full word you got to come back to the truth he said okay well so I'm so glad I'm in the message well that's just that's not it it's you've got to come back to the Christ revealed and we're pointed back to by this message and so I believe if that's that being the truth it's a scary thing to be outside of this outside of the truth this Christ and so as the Believers are separated the disciples were separated it's a type of this end time when Christ has been crucified aresh The Mercy Seat is in plain view again and and this is this what happened there on that first day of the Resurrection I want us to draw a parallel of what happens in our hour in our day not in a literal physical sense but in the spiritual sense Luke chap 24: 25 well I have that wrong to verse 43 I think I might only have it to 27 here but it says this and this is on the road to emus when the disciples are discouraged they're down and Jesus draws near and they don't know who he is and they're like well he's like why are you so sad and they're like you haven't heard what happened there was this man that we beli to be the Messiah and uh and he's been you know they killed him and he uh and you know what besides today was the third day and this was the day that they said that he'd be that he would come back and you know what his tomb's empty and they don't know what happened to the body and it's kind of like are you putting this together you know they weren't quite picking it up and he says then he said to them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory now what kind of shock would have that been to believers who now feel as if maybe they're talking to someone who holds to the Old Testament prophets and this Christ and this Messiah and he's now saying something that kind of connecting with these PR modern events it says and at the beginning and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen what a time what what a moment in this Resurrection season a season of discouragement and fear and wondering what's happening and Promises being fulfilled and these could it bees and then they drew nigh into the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further now this is this parallel I see this parallel to Revelations chap 3 he he's not uh this isn't where he's headed this isn't his destination and so he made as if he was going to go further and it says and they constrained him saying abide with us notice this Zeal of of wanting to don't go don't carry or don't continue on uh don't pass Us by but come in to where we are in F and Su with us Fellowship Feast abide with us for it is toward evening here in this evening time as he would maybe continue on his way they constrain him in the day is far spent and he went into Terry with them so he's been invited it it's maybe not in the same sense of behold I stand at the door and knock and had he just showed up in the neighborhood and a knocked that night maybe we'd see a clear image but we do see that coming up where he makes himself known in behind closed doors and so here they're saying stay with us this is a a pattern of Christ in this T kind of season and he sat at meat with them he took bread and as it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them what is he doing he's supping in the evening time takes meat and bread and notice what he does he breaks it and gives it to them did anybody get invited over to somebody's house for Thanksgiving wow this is nobody got invited about to say man this no nobody got invited somewhere for Thanksgiving well I didn't raise my hand uh but when you go into somebody's house what happens you kind of look to the head of the house what time it's you're going to eat right how many of you just went right in there and started carving the turkey right serving food Everybody by your heads we're going to pray I know we kind of feel that way sometimes we want to get the show on the road but the head of the house does that and so what he's doing here may seem to be very presumptuous but that's what caused them to see who is there is when the Master did what a master would do he had was made known to them in the breaking of bread in the in the blessing because it says and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight cuz he was he was the master he was the Master of the House of the Lord he was the Master of the House and here he's taking Authority he's the one blessing it he's the one breaking it and they said one to another now they realize did not our heart burn within us well he talked with us by the way while he opened to us the scriptures I believe there's a tremendous parallel to those of us who found ourselves just wondering in dark denominationalism and then something just kind of pulled up by our side and begin to fellowship with us and talk to us and open up the scriptures we begin to think wow this is amazing this is this is real I believe this who is this William brandom yeah this is true about the word of God and the more you believe it and the more you kind of find yourself enjoying the word of God there comes a time when you you realize wait a minute it it's been Christ this whole time revealing himself to me kind of like Ruth when she had that Epiphany when she went to Naomi and said man this has been feeding me in the evening time I've been gleaning and denominations are wrong and this is false and we're living this end time and these things are being restored and then finally the Revelation comes from the word ruth this isn't just something better this isn't just a correction to denominationalism this is Boaz this is your near Kinsman this is your Redeemer they realize this is the Christ verse 33 and they rose up the same hour cuz now things have changed what a changing once their eyes are opened and they they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon there's a lot of Clues and things pieced together here and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in Breaking of bread there something particular about that function to them that stood out to them the breaking of bread the the book in the hands the breaking of it and the feeding of it something about this process that really stood out to them and he said this is how he was made known and it stood out enough for them to to for or it was meaningful enough to happen that way for them to remember remember it that way for them to tell it that way for it to be memorialized in the scripture that way and as they thus spake verse 36 now this parallels John 20 notice this Jesus himself stood in the midst of them the doors are shut Jesus is there and said to them peace be unto you now when we read at John nine it says peace be unto you and he showed his hands and his side and then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord this kind of gives us a little bit more context you could thank Luke The Physician for being a little bit more detailed but he says uh that he stood in the midst of them and said Peace verse 37 but they were terrified and affrighted we should use that word more often affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit not not sure what what this is and not sure could you imagine I at this point real devout Stout believers who believed in the Messiah believed in Christ believed he was the master he's crucified and then someone comes telling ghost stories you know he's alive he's doing this and he's doing that and we've seen him and he's appeared and then all of a sudden this it uh it's making itself known to you and you're kind of at first like I don't know about this this seems a little crazy this seems a little bit odd but he he he presses the issue and says in verse 38 why are you troubled why do thoughts arise in your hearts let's put ourselves in their shoes think about where where we can be at times in our own minds and our own difficulties and our own struggles he says behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see this is what God wants us to do when we begin to fear when we begin to doubt when we hear feel the the pressing of the fear from the outside and the worldliness and all the things that seem to surround us this is what he says handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as you see me have this is a process of Christ becoming more real not just a figment of their imagination not a this is some I want you to handle me I want you to know I'm real and he says and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet now you see this parallel directly with John and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you here any meat and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and of a honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them them this this this is the communion this is the supping this is the fellowship wanting to become more real to him now there's things that are transpiring in in these da this what would be seemingly be a normal evening activity Christ is there making himself known and this is where let's just read it again in John chapter 20 verse 21 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so I send you so this is part of this the this disc discourse and this this communing there that evening as we're reading about Luke 24 and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now as we had read it in verses 19 and 20 when he said Peace be unto you and he showed him his hands and his side the disciples are glad when they saw the Lord and now Luke 24 gives us a little bit more of a background that maybe at first they're afraid and so he said Peace be unto you they're afraid he says why are you troubled do you know do you know who I am uh I am not a spirit and he goes to this and he says see me handle me let's eat together and they begin to eat together and this is something that he is saying to them why they're supping why they're communing peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so I send you he's opened himself up revealing himself for a purpose he's not just coming to say if you ever doubted I was alive you can't now and then leave but is going to command as I was sent by the father I am now sending you that phrase in itself is heavy and when he had said this he breathed on them and sa to him receive ye the Holy Ghost this is this symbolism this imagery he's going to come to it in Luke 24 we'll see it in more detail receive you the Holy Ghost whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them these are covered reconciled and whosoever sins ye retain they are retained binding and loosing so to speak and this is the Great Commission and this is a very profound and weighty commission as we mentioned at the very outset of this how that this is one to wrestle with and really try to get your eyes around but Christ and your heart around Christ is sending them out in his place yes amen and whosoever sends you remit they are remitted whosoever are retained they are retained in Luke chapter 24 let's pick it back up uh in Verses 4 4 to 49 and he said to them these are the words which I spake unto you so as he took the word and he's as he's taken and he's eating he's eating broiled fish and honeycomb and he says said to him these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures doesn't necessarily happen at the beginning or in the end but at a particular time he realizes it's opened up their understanding just as he had to them the scriptures and how he's made known like their hearts were burning when he opened up the scriptures then he's made known in the breaking of bread now he's doing the same thing breaking bread eating uh supping with him and opens up their understanding to understand the scriptures and now as this understanding is coming he said unto them all right before I read this next part let's just kind of review where we're at and I know this is combining a lot of stuff that we've been been looking at but we're living in a time when the mercy seat is in plain view Again by the revealed word where Christ has been crucified aresh The Mercy Seat is in plain view and it's now oh God be merciful is the door of Mercy shutting is a Salvation opportunity for salvation's waning so here he is Christ is crucified the word a fresh crucified but yet it is the rising of the sun it's a dark day it's a terrible day but it's the greatest day and there's all these things that we could see that's coming together now we're looking at a similar time in scripture when brother baham said could it be that it's repeating again for the Gentiles they by their Traditions crucified but yet this revealed word which has been crucified exposes that their system is wrong so this is the this is something this is what's happening in that time here in the scripture and it's a parallel we're we're wanting to glean something from it to understand Revelations chapter 3 and these other scriptures for the time that we're living in now even Revelations 10 and he says in verse 47 if I said maybe so and he said to them thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day in that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem so Christ has come he's played done the first part of redemption he's purchased Redemption he's paid the price he's descended to Hell he's unloosed Paradise he ascended up into heaven with those from Paradise presenting himself as the bleeding lamb behind the veil Before the Throne of God be upon the mercy seat and he's declaring that there has been an atonement for sin and because that has happened repentance and remission should be preached you recognize that the very Act of Christ going into heaven and entering Beyond the Veil as it were into the presence of God to present himself as the bleeding lamb which is the atonement for sins that in doing that mankind on Earth didn't all magically become sinless but that repentance and remission should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things so now the witness the one who to whom it has become enlightened who seen it as Witnesses he says behold I send the promise of my father upon you but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high right you are witnesses you are the ones who know these things to be true and so now at this critical juncture he says I want you to go back to Jerusalem as he said breathe them said receive you the Holy Ghost you are to receive the holy ghost at Jerusalem and you're going to be endued with power on high and that's going to make you a authoritative Witness amen a witness of the sacrifice of Christ that you can preach repentance and remission among all nations now think of the events of Revelations chapter 3 verses 19 and 20 Christ is kicked out of the church but behold I call to you and you hear my voice and you open up and then I begin to Su with you and I begin to make myself known to you what's going to happen as you feed on this word of God he's going to go say I send you right I'm commanding you you have got to go and you have got to say the master is come and call it for thee you've got to point people back to Christ you've got to show them that Christ is real and what happens in Revelations chapter 4 the scene opens up and what do we see in that throne room what happens in that Throne Room John's caught up to it what is he witnessing the book becoming open the book in Revelations 10 there's this these parallels taking place to Christ now commanding and commissioning his disciples whosoever sins you remit they are remitted whosoever sins you retain they are retained this is what John says but in Luke he's saying go to Jerusalem you'll be endued with power from on high that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem this is on that day where he's telling them this is what you're uh to do this is what you're called to do and so Christ is going to remain with them convincing them and assuring them of this promise so as we could read in other places in Matthew and Mark and then in Matthew chapter 16 I want to just bring these scriptures in here and I'm I'm oh I'm running out of time maybe I'll just refer to these very quickly when Christ says uh who do men say that I am well some say you're this some say you're that and Peter says th the Christ the son of living God and Jesus says Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed this this is Matthew 16 and he says Upon This Rock the revelation of myself I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee yes Peter uh the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven now this is just not to Peter alone but it's according to this Revelation but we do find that it's Peter on the day of Pentecost who's preaching this inaugural sermon I'm going to give the key to you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven now there's there's a direct connection to what Jesus is saying in John chapter 20 in Luke chapter 24 to what he's telling Peter you're going to be given the Keys of the Kingdom and there's going to be power of this key to bind and to loose and brother brandham says in the church book it's a very remarkable statement this is just finding maybe how it might fit in and and and so I'm not going to read the whole thing but he says you know the church has gotten to a place where all they have is the power of loosing and so there can be a loosing there can be a Deliverance but the power finding is gone so we can exercise in part A Certain Optics to the message and to the word of God but the fullness of this key is both to bind and to loose and the power binding being loosed he says here Thou shalt bind on Earth it will be bound in heaven whatsoever is loosed on Earth is loosed in heaven because that's the Keys of the Kingdom gives you power to bind and loose on Earth and it's reflected in heaven he repeats it again in Matthew 18:18 verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven what happens on the day of Pentecost Christ comes into his church Christ is now the house of God Christ is now or the church is now the house of God the dwelling place of God and they are witnesses and as he had been sent by the father Christ is now sending the church with a commission so look at the commission I'm just going to revisit again peace John 20: 21 and 23 peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so I send you and when he said this he breathed on them and say and say to them receive ye the Holy Ghost this is what they receive in Acts chap in the book of Acts the spirit descends upon him this is the Keys of the Kingdom this is Christ himself this is the promise of the father all these things come he says whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained that sounds a whole lot like Mercy to me now I'm just going to read you three statements there's a over a dozen probably where brother bam deals with this but in the sermon whyatt had to be Shepherd but let's watch how he did it because the conversation was with a Catholic priest and says well the Bible says you can it's powers given to remit sins and retain them and so if I could maybe put this in context of some of the controversies if you begin to talk about well the day of Mercy is over because there's this has happened and people think well there's no more Mercy because there's no more blood well you have to understand dispensations and Seasons you say when God God is no longer above us yep God's no longer above you no he was with you amen God's still with them and even down to the church ages is God in us and the Son of God revealed himself and then he say oh well we've entered the dispensation of the son of man he's no longer in the church and so oh well then he's not above us he's not in us he's like no he is us right there there's a point where we're coming to this climactic finishing so it's a it's a matter of understanding uh the promise for your day the promise of your hour and someone say wow then the mercy is in the bride the bride is The Mercy Seat and then we take it to mean the bride is actually Christ who shed her blood and it's her bleeding it's her bleeding a and you got to come to the bride to get salvation and believe in the bride and lay your hands on the bride and you just start to make a mess of things trying to figure it all out and so it is true but watch how this Mercy Works how do we become this Mercy in the end time he said but so the Catholic priest says well the priest remit sins and brother Ram said well that's the the scripture is true but let's watch how they remitted sins but let's watch how he did it how the apostles followed out this order not according to the way that the priests do it today but what did the first priest if you want to call him that Peter that had the Keys of the Kingdom how did he do it how did he remit sins Jesus said repentance remission of sins should be preached in the name of Jesus Christ and in John it says whosoever s you remit they shall be remitted and whosoever you retain they shall be retained there is a these stains are essentially the same thing preach repentance and remission and brother Bram says he said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost see see how these scriptures start to dovetail so when Peter came and preached on the day of Pentecost he could go right back to this personal audience with Christ he could go right back to the community table he could go right back to the feasting and know I've got to re preach repentance for the remission of sins I I've got to I've got I've been commanded for this because now power is in my hand to bind and to loose and there's power in this word and this commission to retain or to remit amen so you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises to you and to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God should call and if God is still calling the same experiences for you if you'll follow the same PR prescription if this congregation believes that with your heads bowed say Amen he's just transition he says then anything short of that is contrary to the word and not according to the shepherd anything short of that do you realize now why there is such a tremendous controversy over the godhead and that God is one and he was revealed in his son Jesus Christ and that the the name that were to be baptized is not titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost but in the name of Jesus Christ and you do you want to know what it used to be explicit this way in like the book of Cults the metric you would follow to determine whether or not someone was in a cult is first do they baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost do they deny the Trinity and if yes cult and then you get to degrees of Cults I guess but the very fact that you don't hold to the the the the trinity Aran Dogma or Creed put you outside of that denominational fellowship and so brother Brown said if you this is a narrowing down of things this is a you got to come back to this and I would say according to the scripture that if you are baptizing in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost you are in air according to the word of God contrary to the word brother brandham says it in the sign of his coming Philip was sent to the unic certainly Lord he was sent there by an Angel but it took Philip's hands we realize a vision come to Paul on his road to Damascus but it took anas's hands you listen to this we've gone through Paul's experience in some detail the church the called out the elected one Peter was sent by Vision up to Cornelius but it took the Apostle listen not the vision not the angel recognize that there were players in that day when the vision had come the angel had come but there had to be ones on earth now could you imagine if we said in that day that after Christ had appeared to Peter and the rest of them on the uh through that season and then on the day of Pentecost gives them the Seal of the Holy Ghost say stop the tape at that moment the only ones who are saved who have the Holy Ghost are those who were there in that little room that's it only ones historically accurate the only ones that could preach it right like where else were you going to get it even a paulus is preaching a lot of things on John the Baptist but he doesn't know the he can't preach the full truth he can't preach the revealed word and what did it take Believers to expound on him a more excellent way he said it took the Apostle not the vision not the Angel God I pray tonight that you'll wake people up and let them see the promises here amen it was given to that church whosoever sends you remit to them they they are remitted Lord we know there's many of them claim it but they're unauthorized Apostles because they are unscriptural you cannot you can't just take the scripture say well this is what I'm going to do you have to be authorized it took Philip's hands an anas's hands took Peter to Cornelius there's a vision there's an angel but it had it took the people to wake up and then it in the sermon it is the rising of the sun that's that divine revelation of the word was made flesh it was if it was flesh in that day by the son the groom it's the flesh today by the bride right you can start building a lot of things in from that sermon into this very point if it was flesh then in that day by the son the bridegroom the divine revelation of the word made flesh it's these are my the Divine word the divine revelation of the word made flesh by the bride yeah and the very next scripture he reads John 20 whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained H now the Catholic Church pick that up and takes it to their priest but that's carnal right watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it that's the reason he told them to go baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost he knew they knew who he was he knew they knew who he was there takes a revelation of who he was and those who are eyewitnesses those to whom he reveals himself too they are under a commandment they have a burden to what to tell who he is it's a spiritual re revealed word that did it to not only make himself known to you behold I stand at the door and knock that's you Lord come in Su with me come into me enlighten me become part of me rise to life inside of me and the Revelation is you are now the bear of my presence you are now dressed in the bleeding bloody word you are an Avenue and a channel to Mercy because you are and you have the voice of truth if you don't live this accurately people won't see the lamb if you don't speak this accurately people won't see the lamb that's why we got to come back to Holiness that's why the Bible teaches things about the way the men act and the women dress what even happened to Paul after he was Christ revealed himself to him after Christ revealed himself and he knew his life was changing who are you Lord and he said I am Jesus and it's at that moment that Paul is like oh no I have made a huge mistake whom thou persecutest and Paul realizes man I've been ignorant I've been a murderer and I there could have been such fear coming on him in that moment he can't see anymore he's like I'm a dead man think of the zealots and just how they would have felt how they followed after these things and murdered people and killed people Zeal the house is eating me up I'm in the order of Pinos I'm going to murder I'm going to kill in the name of the Lord I'm going to stay the plague and then God say you're sticking the javelin right through me you're murdering me and Paul thought man the those under the law they're stoned they were killed I'm guilty eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth I took this man's life I'm guilty of life I I'm going to die and what happened God says go to Damascus I'm going to send somebody I'm G to speak to you and Paul's there praying God gives him a vision ananas comes it's ananas hands Paul repents then God says in Acts 26:16 God speaking to Paul but arise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose what's the purpose of the opening what's the purpose of the revealing to make thee a minister and a wit both of these things which thou has seen and those things in the which I will appear unto thee a minister sure certainly a five-fold gift is implied here and to anyone who AIDS another in a work a help meat a witness one that's bearing record he was a witness of God's glory of things revealed to be revealed he says those things what you have seen and those things I will reveal to you this is a pattern of what happens today when Christ becomes real to you you become a minister and a witness you are a witness of these things so we are to testify of these things in second Peter 1: 16 and 18 Peter one of these eyewitnesses says we have not followed cly devised fables we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for we received from God the Father honor and Glory I apologize for he received from God the Father honor and Glory now it's Mount Transfiguration what was this a rehearsal a preview significant uh pattern in symbolism here in this event when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount now what is the attraction on the mountain now who is this smdc just as the disciples were eyewitnesses of his majesty and of the voice of Mercy we have a voice today just as they were uh following in Christ and being taught by Christ they come to this uh I want to just say climactic season just so much activity happening in a short period of time where their Lord and Master is crucified and he's buried and they're scared and they're frightful and they don't know what's going to happen but he appears to them on that Resurrection morning and he begins to make himself known to them and the breaking of bread begins to commune with them and fellowship in the resurrection in the and the after math of a crucifixion there is a resurrection and there is a divine presence of the son with his Believers and with his children and there he's communing with them behind closed doors there he's making himself known and supping and it's an image that behold I stand at the door and knock I have been pushed out of the church I've been crucified aresh but I am here it is the rising of the sun I'm here to come into you to rise to life and to being and the bride and there will be a feast and there will be a communion and the breaking of bread and what has he whispered to us what is he telling us take eat Take and Eat and as we're eating cuz notice he's there eating broiled fish and honeycomb and as he's eating he's saiding as the father sent me so I send you and we're thinking oh man I I thought this was it I thought it was going to be over now he's like no no no you got a job to do and and and I'm I'm going to send the promise of the father you're going to be a dude with power from on high and you're going to be Witnesses and you are going to be the one that preaches repentance and remission what does the Bible say in Revelations 10:1 I'm just drawing on the fact that I know I'm speaking to well-taught Believers today take the book and eat it and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings whenever there's a meal whenever there's a feast whenever there's a partaking you become what you eat is one way that we say it and there's this speaking out there's this commission this commanding you must go preach brother B took it in the rising of the Sun and said the bride today who is him is to be those who have this power of REM sins and the remission of sins and how was it it's the spiritual revelation of the word that gives you that power and it's not you that has the power is the revealed word that you hold that is the power that's how you have it he said watch how they do it he says it in several places the ministers who are here that have studied these things out can point you right in the message of the hour the other places where brother M using this scripture saying look this power to remit was in the church by the preaching of the word not halfth truth right but the full word brother said she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and you think flesh and blood bone bone Flesh Blood bone You' think all these things but he doesn't say blood he says life of his life power of his power where is the life it's in the blood amen so it's the life life of his life we embod that element which the blood was symbolic of life I've been an hour right at this point or maybe 59 minutes but I I'm instead of asking for permission or apologizing I'm just informing us all that I've got just a one more long scripture couple scripture readings to read and then we'll be done notice this in Revelation excuse me Romans chapter 9: 22- 26 then we'll skip to chapter 11 just want to read through this and recognize how that we now as Christ life and power have become this voice of repentance and remission that if the word preached is rejected those sins are retained the word received and believed those sins are remitted now we're not the ones doing the to remit right we're not burning candles and those different things but there's a a word preached repentance and remission has to be preached among all nations and they had to be sent out to preach it so what do they become this is the way the truth the life being preached now is a a perfect parallel or just laying on top of these things that we've already ministered so far you could see such an incredible uh overlap now because the Jews having rejected him and the Gentiles be brought in uh raises a lot of questions it says what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction quite a supposition and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy vessels of Wrath vessels of Mercy which he had a prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles I know there's a lot lot there that he's saying as he said also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved Gentiles and it shall come to pass that in that the place where it was said unto them ye are not not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God this is the Gentile bride the Gentile church this is Believers that are chosen and elected by God and they're are vessels of Wrath which are subject to destruction but then he says that God will make known The Riches of his glory on vessels of Mercy a vessel is a chosen instrument a a a vessel is a one that is an assistant or one that helps assist in accomplishing something now I want you to think about these vessels of Mercy as being more than ones upon which his Mercy is shed but rather he says that they upon which he'll pour out the riches of his glory on vessels of Merc Mercy which he prepared unto Glory but what you contain and what you hold and what you become a bear of and what you become an instrument of is an instrument instument of Mercy that's why ananas could lay his hands on him that's why Cornelius could that's why that's why you could find Peter going why because they were vessels of Mercy life of his life the life is in the blood the bride has the token and in Romans chapter 11 Brothers you can get you can just get ready on your instruments Romans 11: 25-33 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that the blindness in part is happened to Israel and the fullness of the Gentiles become come in and so all Israel shall be saved as it written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes there's again this is this this division now that is transpired where the Jews having rejected Christ and the Gentiles which are receiving Christ and and to the to the Jews It's Kind like who invited you to our party you know now you're claiming to be the one and you know there's a it's kind of remarkable as one brother said to me recently he said that you know the Jews are Antichrist I was like well qu quite literally right they crucified it but you got to be careful because there's this sometimes a demonization there's anti-semites in the message what they've done is they've latched onto a lot of right-wing rhetoric and and their Holocaust apologizers and deniers be careful the things you're feeding on seeps in very very subtly and it's it's completely perverting Romans 11 because Paul just say they're all Antichrist right and saying you know what we should do we should just we should kill them all that's probably a good idea you know cuz after all we kind of compete with them economically but Paul says no no no no no no no and he says verse 29 for gifts and callings of God are without repentance you don't have to say sorry for being gifted you don't have to repent or apologize for a calling and notice he says this and and I'm just saying that in there is the the levels of interpretation on that are very rich but he says verse 30 for as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief you listening even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also May obtain Mercy put yourself in the place of the scripture today that those who have not believed that we might find it very easy to rail against Revelation 317 is naked blind reject blasphemers and all sorts of things that we might say Kill Them All to recognize that in times past we did not believe but yet obtained Mercy ignorant blasphemers injurious should have known better even so these also now that do not believe through your mercy through vessels of Mercy May obtain Mercy for God ha concluded that all in unbelief concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways pass finding now oh hallelujah what I want to be is one that walks in the depth of these Riches of the wisdom of the knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways pass finding now not that I would condemn not that I would banish to hell but that I could be a vessel of mercy so That Others May obtain Mercy in their ignorance in their unbelief yes especially so brother random says in the unveiling of God you're templ in Christ that's behind the veil the veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever okay all right it hides the word of God from the unbeliever the veil does there's the house of the Lord in behind the veil is the shikina of Glory in behind the veil is the presence of God he's saying you are templ in Christ you have become that Dwelling Place The Throne of God is in the heart of man and he's hidden from the unbeliever he's hidden in the Simplicity of The Believer from the unbeliever and if he's hid in the Simplicity of the believer to those to whom he is hidden how is he going to reveal himself God reveals himself in the same in the simplicity of the believer he Veil brother man said he veils himself today in earn vessels with the shakina the outside looks like a bunch of Holy Rollers old Badger skins but the inside hides the shikina glory we we better wrestle out what this looks like because the Bible says in Revelations 22:7 and the spirit and the bride say come that's a voice of Mercy amen let him that hear say come am you notice what's happening the spirit and the bride speak and then one whose ear hears the voice he's speaking the same thing and let him that a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely God give us the grace to recognize our place in this hour is a voice of Mercy these scriptures are very beautiful Ro Romans 9 and Romans 11 but I want to connect them together now as we close that you are vessels of Mercy that through Mercy they may obtain Mercy you realize the Bible teaches and we kind of had left some of these things out as we're just maybe wrapping up this portion on Mercy Wednesday night we have a little bit more to finish on the voice of Mercy Lord willing but how the Bible says that if you you do not show Mercy you won't obtain it you won't receive it and that it be something just to dig into on causation and correlation and someone who doesn't show Mercy will not receive Mercy now if we just kind of inverted or we kind of took it apart to figure out how it works could it be that those who don't show it have never obtained it anyways they've never received it they've never accepted it and that's why they so hard for them to give it and it raises the question of the parable and why it's there that the one who's forgiven and oh I've made a Mist I I can't pay and the the judge the J judge says the master says I forgive you and the Very one who is Forgiven turns right around and is very harsh and punishing and won't show mercy and so what does the the master do say whoa wait a minute hold on you've missed it you've perverted my Justice you've perverted my Mercy let us not be those that have received such a great grace in this hour and a great Mercy let us not be guilty of not showing Mercy how quickly we cut people off how quickly we can become so stubborn and OBS how quickly we can judge and maybe sometimes it's not from that place of judgment and harshness maybe sometimes it's a place of great hurt and discouragement but let us not lose hope that we are as Christians his beloved his elect his Dwelling Place his voice on Earth Christians are the dwelling place of God and maybe I could just share this now I was sharing this with brother El eer when we're fellowshipping Wednesday night I believe that's when it was and how that the very fact that the holy the glory of God this is kind of go the presence of God is the Holy Ghost just swiftly departing it's leaving it's almost as if it's withdrawn itself from the the Earth and when the the the bride I say bride but when the believer when those who have been sealed with the Holy Ghost are resurrected and the and those that are alive and remain are changed in a moment at twink ey we call that the Rapture when that happens and we meet the Lord in the air those that are left behind cannot be saved there's no more salvation right so when the bride's gone there's no more salvation yeah when the bride's gone there's no more Voice of Truth when the bride's gone there's no more voice of Mercy that do I mean you say well brother and there correlation okay all right let's correlate when you're gone there can't be anymore and all they could do is pretend to worship and fully on worshiping Satan and it's at that time that those who have confessed him those who have believed in him who had not received the the guarantee of the Resurrection they better hold fast because they'll have to seal their Testament their own blood to be saved at White Throne so as long as we're here let's believe let's believe there can be Soul saved I was reading how brother bradam said oh God be merciful to us and as we see our churches and our full gospel groups begin to cool down it seems like there's no great crying for Life lost souls there's no more that sincere all night prayer meditation in the word and it seems like that we've just drifted Lord forgive us oh God let us renew ourselves tonight a fresh in the Holy Spirit I I I feel that Satan attacks these truths so tremendously and he says and tonight it seems like we can dress nice and sit down and listen and go home unconcerned and as we're listening we're like I'm glad he said tonight he says oh Lord stir our hearts tonight I'm going to change it and today it seems like we can dress nice and sit down and listen and go home UNC unconcerned oh Lord stir our stir our hearts today put a Zeal in us for lost souls May ministers and the Ley every person becomeing a part of the kingdom and with a burning desire that we that we'd canvas cities and everywhere and pull the Lost out of the gutters and get them as fire brands for the lord it's not a bunch of bingo swimming contest and bunch of nonsense we can't be guilty uh of of what some Protestants trinitarians just get them to say a say and have a mantra we're just trying to get him to Christ we're just trying to get him to Christ well you won't be able to do that by watering down the word you know by saying well do you believe in God and do you believe in Jesus and will you accept Jesus as your personal Savior and they go yes you're saved I've LED you to Christ get God happy and it's kind of like you walk away thinking what was that let's be real with it let's wrestle it out let's figure it out let's find a way as we we read before like God help me to figure out how I wish I could remember just exactly how brother BR said it like how can we accurately portray this gospel tell me Lord how to reach these lost souls tell me how to to be a witness in this hour amen and and I realize there's a lot of things that brother bam says in the scripture that certainly uh challenges the church because it talks about churches no longer having all night prayer meetings well how many have we had in the last four years none right here we haven't had an all night prayer meeting and you say well is that what it takes okay fine we could do that but what are we praying for what's our premise what's our what's our goal what are we trying to accomplish you want to invite a sinner to an all night prayer meeting they're going to take a nap you got to find a way God help us help us Lord to be accurate Reflections I'm not saying that we shouldn't have an all night prayer meeting I'm not saying that a Believer couldn't get saved there but we've got to find the channel that God can work in to Canvas to reach out to shine God help us today you are the Temple of Christ I believe that you are the ones that can be merciful just take it into our own personal relationships with other people that I am a throne I am the Throne of judgment and the Throne of Mercy what Avenue do you want to choose you want to choose to look at your uh your children or your other believers you want to look at them Through The Eyes of judgment or Through The Eyes of grace and mercy as the Bible said that God was longsuffering God waited even those with the unbelievers and it's actually through that longsuffering that others were brought into the precious promise and Grace then I want to be longsuffering and God help us to be better better voices amen amen and I I say this from my heart I believe Satan is fighting this this truth with everything that's in him and if I can say as I've experienced the the fight and the devil fighting against this over the last while that maybe the notion is move on just just make your life a little bit easier but I I want to be a I want to be faithful to say that God has called us to a special place in this hour in don't faint don't withdraw no matter what happens no matter what comes no matter what's said and what's done stay faithful because you are the bearers of God's presence it's not one it's not a oneman Ministry it's not a church name it's not it's not in the fivefold and and we just reverence all the all the Levites that are carrying the ark across the Jordan and and we and we just put all the honor in the men of God you have been made a minister and a witness and our job as ministers is to support you The Voice we have an audience here but if anything this is the communion right this is the breaking of bread this is the fellowship this is in behind closed doors and it says go go out into the places of fellowship and the different people you come in contact with and be a bear of God's presence let's pray together stand with me
