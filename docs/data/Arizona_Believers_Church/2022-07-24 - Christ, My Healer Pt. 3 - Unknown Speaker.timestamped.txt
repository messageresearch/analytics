[0:00] what psalms 107 verses 17 to 20
[0:03] it says fools because of their
[0:05] transgression and because of their
[0:06] iniquities are afflicted
[0:08] their soul abhoreth all manner of meat
[0:10] and they draw near into the gates of
[0:12] death
[0:13] then they cry unto the lord in their
[0:15] trouble and he saveth them out of their
[0:16] distresses what a remarkable passage
[0:19] he sent his word and healed them and
[0:21] delivered them from their destructions
[0:23] oh that men would praise the lord for
[0:26] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[0:27] to the children of men and let them
[0:29] sacrifice
[0:30] the sacrifices of thanksgiving and
[0:32] declare his works with
[0:34] rejoicing amen god bless you you can
[0:37] take your seats
[0:39] i have a a tremendous amount of
[0:41] scriptures in front of me and i realized
[0:44] that at some point we might want to just
[0:46] stop and uh pick up later on
[0:49] and so trust you'll kind of just stay
[0:50] real close to what we're ministering on
[0:52] and try to get out of it as much as you
[0:55] possibly can we're on the subject of
[0:58] christ my healer that's the title the
[1:00] subject is divine healing
[1:02] and it has a lot to do with placing our
[1:04] faith correctly in scripture and if our
[1:07] faith is placed right then it can grow
[1:09] and we've even labored on showing that
[1:12] we have faith it's a gift of god and
[1:14] sometimes it's not a matter of not
[1:16] having faith it's just not having it
[1:18] placed exactly right so we're wanting
[1:20] our faith to be placed right so that can
[1:21] grow and in the subject i really are
[1:24] hoping that christ becomes more personal
[1:26] to us so that we understand christ a
[1:28] little bit more
[1:30] and i could say this that we are
[1:33] endeavoring to strengthen our faith by
[1:34] even looking at a specific promise as we
[1:36] say christ my healer we're looking at
[1:38] the promise of divine healing we're
[1:40] learning about a very specific promise
[1:42] in scripture or an attribute of god and
[1:44] in doing that it will strengthen our
[1:46] faith even by
[1:48] zeroing in on just one thing it can
[1:50] strengthen our faith because we know
[1:52] that our perfection will come by faith
[1:54] and that faith comes by hearing the word
[1:56] and it grows by hearing the word
[1:59] we read this statement last time i
[2:01] believe last time we ministered on this
[2:02] subject we've been preaching on this on
[2:05] a series on wednesday nights and so if
[2:07] some of you are like we're we've been
[2:09] when have we started this subject we
[2:10] started on a wednesday night a few
[2:11] wednesday nights ago and i'm going to go
[2:13] i want to move it to sundays now for
[2:15] some time as the lord would lead
[2:17] and so hopefully we'll all kind of be
[2:19] caught up together in this it's the
[2:21] statement and what it takes to overcome
[2:22] all unbelief he says now the initial and
[2:25] original way to receive any redemptive
[2:27] blessing is by hearing the word of god
[2:31] because faith cometh by hearing hearing
[2:32] the word of god he says like the
[2:34] ministers preached so
[2:36] we can say this redemption is in the
[2:38] word and so there is a promise of
[2:40] redemption or there are redemptive
[2:42] blessings that god has given his
[2:43] children and i know this is just stating
[2:46] the obvious but the original way of
[2:49] receiving any redemptive blessing is to
[2:51] hear about it
[2:53] it may seem extremely logical but if you
[2:55] don't know anything about redemption if
[2:57] you don't know about the blessings of
[2:58] christ then once you hear about it
[3:00] that's your opportunity to just receive
[3:02] it by faith because you hear it's a
[3:04] promise to you your faith reaches out
[3:06] and grabs it and then you can receive it
[3:08] so to receive a redemptive blessing you
[3:10] have to first heard about it and paul
[3:12] talks about how can they believe except
[3:14] they hear and he goes through that
[3:16] process in romans 10 of how hearing the
[3:18] word of god causes one to believe and
[3:20] then they call upon the name of the lord
[3:22] so that's god's original way of
[3:24] redemption is his word being preached
[3:27] and so in this
[3:29] today i guess i'll say this today in
[3:31] this part three on this series uh we're
[3:33] going to be identifying healing as an
[3:35] attribute of god and how he has given us
[3:38] a promise to heal in his word and it's
[3:40] going to be very very fundamental but i
[3:42] hope that the picture becomes more vivid
[3:44] for you
[3:45] if you look at verse 17 of psalms 107
[3:48] we're just now looking back at our text
[3:50] it says
[3:52] fools because of their transgression and
[3:54] because of their iniquities are
[3:56] afflicted
[3:57] their soul of worth all manner of meat
[3:59] and they draw near to the unto the gates
[4:01] of death then they cry unto the lord in
[4:03] their trouble and he saveth them out of
[4:06] their distresses the psalmist here is
[4:08] first identifying a spiritual sickness
[4:11] the depravity of mankind putting it even
[4:13] in the context of a fool because of
[4:15] their transgression and because of their
[4:17] iniquities are afflicted and he's
[4:19] outlining that it is because of sin that
[4:21] there is sickness
[4:23] if there was no sin there would be no
[4:24] sickness so it's because of sin that
[4:26] their sickness and so that is if i could
[4:29] emphasize this and i'm using these
[4:31] scriptures because it just brings us
[4:32] right to the gate of it he says fools
[4:35] because of their transgression and
[4:36] because of their iniquities are
[4:38] afflicted because of sin their sickness
[4:40] and that is why in the atonement for our
[4:43] sins there's healing
[4:45] when he had paid the price for our
[4:47] redemption it included healing in isaiah
[4:50] chapter 53 verse 5 but he was wounded
[4:53] for our transgressions he was bruised
[4:56] for our iniquities so he said fools
[4:58] because of their transgression and
[5:00] because of their iniquities but now in
[5:02] prophecy of christ he's wounded for our
[5:04] transgressions he's bruised for our
[5:06] iniquities the very cause for affliction
[5:09] and it says and the chastisement of our
[5:12] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[5:15] we are healed
[5:18] so in the the taking care of our
[5:21] transgressions in the taking care of our
[5:23] iniquities
[5:24] there is peace for us and there is
[5:26] healing for us by his stripes we are
[5:28] healed
[5:29] as we read in psalms 103 a few weeks ago
[5:32] bless the lord o my soul and all that is
[5:34] within me bless his holy name bless the
[5:37] lord o my soul and forget not all his
[5:40] benefits
[5:41] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[5:44] healeth all thy diseases so they find
[5:48] that they they begin to become
[5:49] companions one with another that if sin
[5:52] is atoned for sin is the cause of
[5:54] sickness that there's also a promise for
[5:56] healing in the word of god by virtue of
[5:58] his shed blood
[6:00] which covers your soul atones for your
[6:02] sins but then there's divine healing
[6:04] that comes with it and brother branham
[6:06] in the sermon the godhead explained
[6:09] this is a very striking statement i
[6:11] believe that divine healing is based
[6:13] upon a principle that you ought to come
[6:15] to god first and give your heart to him
[6:18] now i know it's not necessary that
[6:20] someone be a christian or that someone
[6:23] be filled with the holy ghost to receive
[6:24] healing but ultimately what was the
[6:27] price of redemption for not just merely
[6:28] to heal a sick body but to save our
[6:31] souls so it being
[6:34] and i think it's i want to be careful
[6:36] the way that i say it because i'm almost
[6:37] saying it's kind of a a consequence or a
[6:39] byproduct but he gave his life to redeem
[6:42] our souls and that such a tremendous
[6:44] shedding of blood that it includes the
[6:46] healing of our body and by faith people
[6:49] can receive healing but all the ultimate
[6:51] would be the saving of the soul the
[6:53] healing of the soul so he says he
[6:55] believes that divine healing is based
[6:56] upon a principle that you ought to come
[6:58] to god first and give your heart to him
[7:00] because the shedding of blood was to
[7:01] purchase that heart he says and wash up
[7:04] your lives in the blood of jesus christ
[7:05] and then god will go to work with you
[7:07] and heal you
[7:08] i'd say that would be that would be the
[7:10] ultimate if someone's sick and you know
[7:12] that they don't know the lord you'd want
[7:13] to minister to them in such a way to
[7:15] where they come to know the lord and
[7:16] they and their hearts may move to
[7:19] receive christ not just merely so that
[7:20] they can be healed but so that their
[7:22] sins can be forgiven
[7:24] in jeremiah chapter 17 verse 14 heal me
[7:27] o lord and i shall be healed
[7:29] if he heals you you are healed he says
[7:31] save me and i shall be saved for thou
[7:33] art my praise
[7:35] so the healing and salvation you find
[7:38] are are closely connected together but
[7:41] we know your body can be healed and then
[7:43] get sick again
[7:45] we may all be able to testify to that
[7:47] that we god heals us of one thing and
[7:49] only to have another issue or even
[7:51] sometimes the very same thing that we
[7:53] are healed of
[7:54] later on it can come right back again
[7:56] but when your soul is delivered it is
[7:58] delivered forever
[8:00] god can't save you to lose you the price
[8:02] that he paid for your soul and the
[8:04] healing of the soul it is permanent but
[8:06] yet god can heal your body for your body
[8:09] only to get sick again
[8:10] so the fools because of their
[8:12] transgressions and their iniquities are
[8:14] sick the psalmist is bringing sickness
[8:16] into view in our sins and our iniquities
[8:18] and then he says that they cried unto
[8:20] the lord and he saved them out of their
[8:22] distresses verse 20 he sent his word and
[8:25] healed them and delivered them from
[8:27] their destructions
[8:29] he sent his word and his word healed him
[8:32] he sent his word and his word delivered
[8:34] them from their destructions it's the
[8:36] word that accomplished it he says oh
[8:37] that men would praise the lord for his
[8:39] goodness and for his wonderful work to
[8:40] the children of men and let them
[8:42] sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving
[8:44] and declare his works with rejoicing
[8:49] the psalmist in
[8:50] in using this phrase he sent his word
[8:53] and healed them and his word delivered
[8:54] them he's looking back upon what god had
[8:57] done for israel and how that god
[8:59] demonstrated his power to heal and how
[9:01] it came to pass even by the word
[9:04] in exodus chapter 23 verse 25 and ye
[9:06] shall serve the lord your god and he
[9:08] shall bless thy bread and thy water and
[9:10] god speaking and i will take sickness
[9:13] away from the midst of thee
[9:16] notice this promise and if it and i said
[9:18] in the beginning this is going to be
[9:20] very fundamental and you're saying well
[9:22] i believe in healing i believe in
[9:23] healing i believe in him well then we're
[9:24] just supporting it
[9:26] i don't feel that i came today trying to
[9:28] bring something new or convince a
[9:29] skeptic
[9:30] i know that there's some and
[9:31] dispensationalists that believe that
[9:33] miracles were taken out of the church
[9:34] and that there is no more divine healing
[9:36] but at least we're looking in the
[9:37] scripture to identify that god at one
[9:39] time they would have to admit healed
[9:42] sicknesses he says i will take sickness
[9:44] away from the midst of thee
[9:47] and this is this is a declaration that
[9:49] he makes in the exodus and in exodus in
[9:52] the beginning of exodus exodus chapter
[9:54] uh three and four the lord says i am
[9:57] come down in exodus chapter three he
[9:59] meets with moses at the burning bush he
[10:01] says i am come down to deliver thee this
[10:03] is the very genesis of the exodus
[10:06] and he's going to take the children of
[10:07] israel out of egypt and out of bondage
[10:10] and at the very outset of commissioning
[10:12] moses he performs a miracle
[10:15] to declare this attribute of healing in
[10:18] exodus chapter 4 verses 6 and 7 and the
[10:21] lord said furthermore unto him this is
[10:23] after his staff turned into a serpent
[10:25] and back again he says put now thy hand
[10:27] into thy bosom and he put his hand into
[10:30] his bosom and when he took it out behold
[10:32] his hand was leprous as snow so he puts
[10:35] his hand in his bosom inside his cloak
[10:37] as it were and he brings out and he's
[10:38] got leprosy on his hand
[10:40] and and this would be shocking and he
[10:42] says and he and he says in verse 7 put
[10:44] that hand into thy bosom again
[10:46] and he put his hand into his bosom again
[10:48] and he plucked it out of his bosom
[10:50] behold it was turned again as his other
[10:53] flesh
[10:55] in deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 29 it
[10:57] says see that i even i am he and there
[10:59] is no god with me i kill and i make
[11:02] alive i wound and i heal neither is
[11:05] there any that can deliver out of my
[11:06] hand that's exactly what he did with
[11:08] moses his hand was perfectly fine no
[11:11] leprosy puts it in his bosom to withdraw
[11:13] it again and it has leprosy but then he
[11:16] asked him to put it back in again and
[11:18] the very one that put the leprosy on him
[11:20] is the very one that heals and it may
[11:22] seem to be a paradox but he says i kill
[11:25] and i
[11:26] and i will
[11:27] make alive i wound and i heal
[11:30] so when moses puts his hand in his cloak
[11:33] and he removes it and it's leprous and
[11:35] then he puts it in again and he takes it
[11:36] out brother branham says it showed him
[11:38] divine healing
[11:40] and as moses is being commissioned and
[11:42] moses is wondering how is it that i am
[11:44] going to go down and deliver the
[11:46] children out of egypt your children out
[11:48] of egypt
[11:49] how can i declare your power how can i
[11:51] declare your greatness and god gives
[11:53] them these signs the staff being turned
[11:55] into a serpent and then this sign of his
[11:57] hand turning leprous you don't see it
[11:59] demonstrated before pharaoh or before
[12:02] genesis jamboree's or anyone's but
[12:03] brother man said divine healing is
[12:05] included in the glory of god
[12:08] he says another place divine healing is
[12:10] god's glory
[12:11] so god's glory is going to be made known
[12:13] in egypt and so he's showing
[12:15] uh
[12:16] moses this attribute of this
[12:18] characteristic so he can have this
[12:20] confidence in god
[12:22] to go down and deliver the children at
[12:23] his command
[12:25] in exodus chapter 15 verse 26 this may
[12:28] be one of the most outstanding
[12:29] scriptures
[12:30] on
[12:31] the a god being a healer
[12:34] and said if thou wilt diligently hearken
[12:36] to the voice of the lord thy god and
[12:38] will do that which is right in his sight
[12:40] and will give ear to his commandments
[12:41] and keep all his statutes i will put
[12:44] none of these diseases upon thee which i
[12:46] brought upon the egyptians so he's the
[12:48] one that wounds
[12:50] and he says i will keep you from being
[12:52] sick and so that's a testimony uh we
[12:54] ought to thank god for healing or we
[12:56] ought to thank god for good health
[12:58] uh
[12:59] just as much as we would pray when we're
[13:00] sick maybe we should praise when we're
[13:02] well
[13:04] when we get really desperate when we're
[13:05] sick and the covet test comes back
[13:07] positive and we want god to stop it and
[13:09] we want god to heal us and we call out
[13:11] to him and saying god deliver us if we
[13:12] are well and we're not sick we should
[13:14] probably have an equal amount of praise
[13:16] and thanksgiving for keeping us well
[13:18] because it's the lord that keeps us from
[13:20] diseases
[13:21] and he says for i am the lord that
[13:24] healeth thee
[13:25] that's jehovah rapha the lord that heals
[13:28] i am the lord that healeth him i i think
[13:31] maybe it's kind of in the undercurrent i
[13:33] won't emphasize it maybe over and over
[13:35] again but god's the only one who can
[13:36] heal
[13:38] there's no other healer there's no
[13:39] divine healer outside of god it's
[13:42] jehovah rapha the lord that heals
[13:45] bill abram said he can't be jehovah
[13:46] rapha without being jehovah jireh
[13:48] neither can he be jehovah jabra without
[13:50] being jehovah rapha
[13:51] all these attributes these seven
[13:53] redemptive names of jehovah
[13:55] they're all kind of working together in
[13:57] each one declaring the same god not
[14:00] chopped up individuals say oh i'm
[14:01] praying today to jehovah jibril the one
[14:03] who sees and conv providing oh well
[14:05] that's great because i'm praying to
[14:07] jehovah rapha because i need physical
[14:09] healing no it's the same one it's the
[14:11] same jehovah it's the same jesus christ
[14:14] and if he's jehovah jireh he's also
[14:16] jehovah rapha he was wounded for our
[14:18] transgressions and with his stripes we
[14:20] are healed
[14:22] and so this is the psalmist he sent his
[14:24] word and healed them it's in a way it's
[14:26] looking backwards but it's also
[14:28] prophetic
[14:29] uh going forward because god
[14:32] is revealing himself in exodus
[14:34] and the exodus and to the children of
[14:36] israel through moses he's revealing
[14:38] himself to the seed of abraham as a
[14:40] healer
[14:42] and healing was in their atonement
[14:44] job writes about it it's written of job
[14:46] much earlier in job 5 18. he says he
[14:48] maketh sore which is the lord that
[14:51] wounds and heals he maketh sore and
[14:52] bindeth up he woundeth and his hands
[14:55] make whole this is a characteristic of
[14:57] god in psalms 30 verse 2 oh lord my god
[15:00] i cried unto thee and thou hast healed
[15:02] me delivered me saved me
[15:04] this is a characteristic of god
[15:07] we find in genesis chapter 20 verse 17
[15:09] so abraham prayed unto god and god
[15:12] healed abimelech and his wife and his
[15:14] maidservants and they bear children
[15:16] here's the prayer of abraham the father
[15:18] of faith praying for one praying for his
[15:20] family and god heals them
[15:23] and his maidservants his wife and they
[15:25] bear children
[15:27] god healed abimelech
[15:30] in second kings chapter 20 verse 5 it
[15:32] says turn again and tell hezekiah the
[15:34] captain of my people
[15:35] thus saith the lord the god of david thy
[15:38] father
[15:39] i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy
[15:42] tears and behold i will heal thee and
[15:45] the third day thou shalt go up unto the
[15:47] house of the lord
[15:48] these are all these are just a few
[15:50] examples of divine healing in the old
[15:51] testament how abraham prays and god
[15:54] heals abimelech here hezekiah cries out
[15:56] to the lord oh leaked in my days don't
[15:57] cut my day short and he says i've heard
[15:59] thee and i will heal thee this is prayer
[16:02] being offered up and god healing the
[16:04] individual
[16:05] who is sick these are all examples of
[16:08] divine healing being a uh or just if i
[16:10] say this why healing being a divine
[16:11] attribute or a characteristic of god
[16:16] it's a mark of god divine healing is a
[16:18] mark of god
[16:21] in numbers chapter 21
[16:24] verse start with verse 6 and then we'll
[16:26] skip and the lord sent fiery serpents
[16:28] among the people and they bit the people
[16:30] and much people of israel died
[16:33] they said again this kind of fits with
[16:34] the i wound and i healed they were
[16:37] complaining and murmuring and what did
[16:39] god do he sent
[16:41] he sent serpents
[16:43] and i know it's a it's it's it's
[16:45] difficult
[16:47] these attributes and characteristics of
[16:48] god people wrestle with these there's
[16:50] people that read the old testament i
[16:51] think man god's crazy
[16:54] it's like the meme that shows jesus
[16:55] knocking on the door
[16:57] and it says
[16:59] open up
[17:00] and jesus says i want to save you and
[17:02] the person says from what and the meme
[17:04] says for what i'm going to do to you if
[17:05] you don't open the door
[17:07] right
[17:08] and that's that's how people look at it
[17:10] they're like i'm so confused here you
[17:11] want me to save me save me for what will
[17:13] save me for what i'm going to do to you
[17:14] if you don't let me save you and the
[17:16] world just tries to understand god
[17:17] through human means and human things but
[17:20] if you could just
[17:22] consider this that there was a god
[17:24] completely invisible
[17:26] that wants to have equal fellowship with
[17:28] someone
[17:30] who does not exist therefore they could
[17:31] not be god right
[17:33] and so there's he he in his wisdom
[17:36] divine has a plan of redemption to bring
[17:39] forth a people that'll love him who is
[17:42] invisible and he can have fellowship
[17:44] with so he wants to manifest himself and
[17:46] declare himself and make himself known
[17:49] to his people and these are the ways
[17:51] that god makes himself known
[17:54] and so he they serve the snakes come out
[17:56] bite the people and they die in verse 8
[17:57] the lord said unto moses make thee a
[17:59] fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and
[18:02] it should come to pass that everyone
[18:03] that is bitten when he looketh upon it
[18:05] shall live
[18:06] and moses made a serpent of brass and
[18:09] put it on a pole and it came to pass
[18:11] that if a serpent had bitten any man
[18:13] when he beheld the serpent of brass he
[18:15] lived
[18:17] and this this is a remarkable occurrence
[18:18] in scripture the deadly serpents are
[18:21] killing people and with the bite they
[18:22] die but now something is lifted up
[18:25] before the people and then this ensign
[18:27] that has lifted up this symbol of a
[18:29] serpent on a pole that when they looked
[18:32] upon it god upon their their eyes
[18:34] meeting that and seeing that they find
[18:36] themselves healed
[18:38] of whatever this venom was that would
[18:41] have killed them
[18:42] the sermon god identified himself by his
[18:44] characteristics he says notice he had a
[18:46] brass serpent that had been lifted up
[18:48] for the sickness and diseases of the
[18:50] people
[18:51] therefore moses was practicing divine
[18:53] healing
[18:54] he had the atonement the brass serpent
[18:56] symbolizing that god was in the camp and
[18:58] the people were looking on that brass
[19:00] serpent and being healed
[19:03] it was uh it was moses was practicing
[19:05] divine healing obeying the word of god
[19:07] lifting up this serpent upon a pole this
[19:09] image of it and they they say that it
[19:11] must have been quite large for it to be
[19:12] in a place where people could view it
[19:14] and see it and be and be healed and it
[19:16] says lift it up
[19:18] before the people and it's divine
[19:20] healing taking place right within the
[19:22] camp taking place right within the
[19:24] children of israel they're looking upon
[19:26] this and they're being healed
[19:29] and there's though there's some debate
[19:30] as to the origin of it there's a lot of
[19:32] evidence to suggest that even subsequent
[19:35] uses of it in mythology
[19:37] it was drawing from this very image in
[19:38] the exodus but we even see it being used
[19:41] in the armed services of a two serpents
[19:43] on a on a pole and and even within the
[19:46] hippocratic oath and within medicine
[19:48] what what is it used to declare i think
[19:50] the world health organization has a pole
[19:52] with a snake wrapped around it and it it
[19:55] calls back to this very image
[19:58] of divine healing
[20:00] medicine is testifies of divine healing
[20:05] a great example we know that
[20:07] life is the healer
[20:09] right
[20:10] you take a dead body or you take you
[20:13] take someone who's dead and you cut the
[20:14] flesh
[20:15] and you put balm on it
[20:17] and you suture it
[20:19] and you put all the ointments all the
[20:20] medicine you do everything you can to
[20:22] the wound in order for it to mend back
[20:24] again it'll never heal itself because
[20:26] life has left the body
[20:28] and that's why life is the healer it's
[20:30] not there's not some medicine there's
[20:32] not some
[20:33] treatment there's not some cure in
[20:35] itself that heals but god has made the
[20:37] body with healing in itself to where god
[20:39] can quicken that attribute and heal the
[20:42] body life is the healer not not just
[20:45] medicine or doctors
[20:47] and i realized that now maybe some
[20:48] statements i wanted to use will just be
[20:50] pushing off for another time
[20:52] but then it this
[20:53] serpent that's lifted up in the
[20:54] wilderness
[20:56] jesus said and as moses john 3 14 and as
[20:59] moses lifted up the serpent in the
[21:01] wilderness even so must the son of man
[21:03] be lifted up what did it foreshadow
[21:05] foreshadowed christ
[21:06] it spoke of christ it declared an
[21:08] attribute of god as a healer but also is
[21:10] declaring this attribute of christ the
[21:12] one who is by his stripes we are
[21:14] healed and
[21:17] so if you are
[21:20] i hope i could come to this about
[21:22] anecdotal faith
[21:24] but if you're
[21:28] if you're just looking at this example
[21:30] people get bit by a snake you take a
[21:31] serpent put on a pole and when they look
[21:33] at the they look at the snake and
[21:35] they're healed now someone could just
[21:37] look at the optics of that just what is
[21:39] seen and then worship the snake
[21:42] or go find a snake and put them on a
[21:44] pole or worship the element of brass and
[21:47] and put all sorts of confidence in the
[21:48] certain elements that existed at the
[21:50] time that they were healed and not
[21:52] realized that god told the prophet to do
[21:55] something and so the healing is
[21:57] connected with god's commandment in not
[21:59] just the brass not the serpent or the
[22:01] pole or the size of it or your ability
[22:04] to see it necessarily but a promise of
[22:06] god
[22:07] and so there's a danger
[22:09] even in this supernatural happening
[22:12] there was a danger
[22:14] that this uh where the people lost focus
[22:17] from god's promise and put it more on
[22:19] the elements
[22:20] and the mechanics of it
[22:22] so ii kings chapter 18
[22:24] verses 3 and 4 when hezekiah became king
[22:27] it says and he did that which was right
[22:28] on the side of the lord and according to
[22:30] all that david his father did and he
[22:32] removed the high places and break the
[22:34] images and cut down the groves and broke
[22:37] break in pieces the brazen serpent that
[22:39] moses had made for under those days the
[22:42] children of israel did burn incense to
[22:44] it and he called it nehushtan
[22:50] which means a thing of brass
[22:54] that's chopping it down right people
[22:56] worshipped it as the brazen serpent and
[22:58] had they burned incense to it it became
[23:01] idolatry to the children of israel and
[23:03] they cut it down and they destroy it and
[23:05] broke it into peace and says it's just a
[23:06] thing of brass
[23:07] because that's really that's all it was
[23:09] it was a thing of brass
[23:10] but it was the promise of god behind it
[23:12] that made it something that they could
[23:14] look upon and heal and so here's the
[23:16] danger that they had taken this very
[23:18] artifact of divine healing and begin to
[23:20] worship the artifact in contradiction to
[23:24] god's saying let there not be any other
[23:26] idols before you to have no graven
[23:28] images and here was something that
[23:30] vindicated his presence in the camp
[23:31] here's something that saved them from
[23:33] death and yet you can take those very
[23:35] things and make them into something that
[23:37] they shouldn't be
[23:39] and that's where there's danger even in
[23:41] these things
[23:43] in the sermon principles of divine
[23:44] healing it says god always had a
[23:46] provided way for the people to be healed
[23:49] he gave it in the days of israel's
[23:50] journey he had the brass serpent
[23:53] after the going away of the brass
[23:55] serpent when people make an idol out of
[23:57] it the prophet broke up the serpent and
[23:59] tore it up and threw it away they made
[24:00] an idol out of the very thing that
[24:02] provided healing
[24:05] and then he gets into the pool of
[24:06] bethesda
[24:08] now that once that pool had been built
[24:10] and that the angel lord would trouble it
[24:12] and that became another place of divine
[24:13] healing for israel
[24:15] but he says god always provided a way
[24:17] for the people to be healed but they
[24:19] made
[24:20] the provided way this are this this
[24:22] element this artifact an idol
[24:28] he says in the sermon being led to the
[24:30] spirit many times the people stray away
[24:33] and they make an idol out of the very
[24:35] thing that god has ordained
[24:38] this is i'm wanting you to focus on this
[24:40] because there's a danger here god
[24:41] manifest himself in this element of
[24:43] divine healing through this brazen
[24:44] serpent but then it actually becomes
[24:46] something that they worship in
[24:47] contradiction to god's word he says many
[24:49] times people stray away and make an idol
[24:52] out of the very thing that god has
[24:53] ordained look at the serpent the brass
[24:54] serpent in the wilderness did you know
[24:56] the prophet had to tear that serpent to
[24:58] pieces it was a king actually why
[25:00] because the people were worshiping the
[25:01] serpent
[25:02] and they made an idol out of it
[25:05] do you believe you can do that today
[25:11] you can make an idol out of your church
[25:15] you can make an idol out of your pastor
[25:17] i'm hoping i'm making that really hard
[25:19] for you
[25:21] you can make an idol out of your pastor
[25:22] you can make an idol out of an
[25:23] evangelist
[25:25] and i'm afraid that that's what a lot of
[25:28] of it's being done they idolized the man
[25:32] now
[25:33] he
[25:34] if we even just look at our sincerity
[25:37] the children of israel didn't just go
[25:39] out and find a pole laying on the ground
[25:41] and someone had carved up a nice snake
[25:43] you know
[25:44] buck whaling put carves a snake out of a
[25:46] piece of wood and you go and you find it
[25:48] and you put it on the you put it on a
[25:50] stick and you start worshiping it no
[25:52] this is something that the god had told
[25:54] moses to do
[25:55] it's associated with the prophet it's
[25:57] associated with his vindication and his
[25:59] presence with israel and the exodus and
[26:01] so in there's just a slight slip just a
[26:04] slight deviation they begin to worship
[26:06] this and so people can make an idol out
[26:08] of their church just so subtly not
[26:10] because they're evil but because they
[26:13] see god move in the church and instead
[26:15] of it drawing them closer to god maybe
[26:17] just with a little bit of leaven they
[26:18] begin to draw closer to their church
[26:20] instead
[26:22] make an idol out of their pastor not
[26:23] because their pastor is worldly and they
[26:25] love worldliness but because god uses
[26:27] the pastor and instead of it being
[26:29] effective to draw them closer to christ
[26:30] they're only seeing the flesh and the
[26:32] man and they begin to lift up the man he
[26:33] says you can make an idol out of an
[26:35] evangelist
[26:36] how because my he comes and he preaches
[26:38] and people are healed and god moves and
[26:40] man he does so much more uh
[26:42] deliverance than the pastor ever does he
[26:44] does so much more delivering
[26:46] and is more dynamic than these other
[26:48] ministers and instead of you thanking
[26:50] god for the gift and recognizing that's
[26:52] the move of god and it's the same christ
[26:54] you make an idol out of the man
[27:00] so with that
[27:01] consider this statement in the message
[27:03] conferences
[27:04] i'm against a lot of this here
[27:06] super-duper divine healing they have in
[27:08] the land today
[27:10] you might not like me after this remark
[27:12] but i'm going to say it anyhow they got
[27:14] so much super duper stuff
[27:16] oh divine healing everything buddy only
[27:18] thing you do is hallelujah is have hands
[27:20] laid on you owe glory to god
[27:24] this is a incredible statement
[27:26] he realized that even in saying it might
[27:28] cause some not to like him because he's
[27:30] identifying some imbalance in an
[27:33] emphasis that isn't centered completely
[27:35] on the word of god where now it's like
[27:36] oh divine healing that's it that's where
[27:38] it's at oh just lay hands on glory to
[27:40] god hallelujah he said that's not so
[27:42] repent and get right with god that's
[27:44] what we need more repentance
[27:48] it's it's identifying how that you can
[27:50] begin to major on something that's
[27:52] complementary
[27:54] and you begin to get the order reversed
[27:57] and the emphasis becomes more on the
[27:58] super duper divine healing more on the
[28:00] divine healing instead of the divine
[28:02] healer
[28:04] emphasis on the brass serpent instead of
[28:06] the one who gave his command to heal
[28:08] them
[28:10] he sent his word and healed them
[28:14] and delivered them from their
[28:15] destructions
[28:16] brother braham said divine healing is
[28:18] based on his word
[28:21] that's what i'm wanting to drive home
[28:23] today is divine healing is based on the
[28:26] word this is very clear in the old
[28:27] testament
[28:28] it was his word it's god's word it's
[28:30] god's promise he sent his word and
[28:32] healed them and his word delivered them
[28:36] the bible teaches us he is the same
[28:38] yesterday today and forever
[28:42] divine healing is based on his word
[28:45] now i'm just taking a piece out
[28:49] because i wanted to then
[28:50] originally i was going to transition
[28:51] from old testament to new testament and
[28:53] begin to show how christ
[28:55] uh the all the miracles they performed
[28:57] and all this ministry of divine healing
[28:59] and how jehovah of the old is jesus of
[29:01] the new and these redemptive names are
[29:04] now in christ jesus
[29:06] and so many different examples we can
[29:08] begin to show of god healing
[29:10] but just to capitalize on he sent his
[29:13] word it says in luke chapter 5 verse 17
[29:15] and it came to pass on a certain day
[29:17] as he was teaching didasko that means to
[29:20] teach or to hold a discourse with others
[29:22] in order to destruct instruct them not
[29:24] destruct them you want to destruct their
[29:26] unbelief
[29:27] and so there is a you're either going to
[29:29] attract the believer or drive and drive
[29:31] unbelief away but he's
[29:34] he's teaching he's instructing them it's
[29:36] to teach one that's what that's where we
[29:38] get the word doctrine from this didasco
[29:41] he's teaching
[29:43] and there were pharisees and doctors of
[29:45] law sitting by oh i got a jd
[29:48] and he says doctors of the law sitting
[29:49] by which were come out of every town of
[29:51] galilee and judea and jerusalem and the
[29:53] power of the lord was present to heal
[29:55] them
[29:57] it wasn't some super-duper healer
[30:00] it wasn't the amount of sweat it wasn't
[30:02] that the the smoke machine was working
[30:04] just well just right that morning but
[30:06] he's just teaching he's holding
[30:08] discourse with others to instruct them
[30:10] and through teaching the word of god it
[30:12] says the power of the lord was present
[30:14] to heal them
[30:17] because the power of god to heal is in
[30:19] his word
[30:21] brother brahman in the sermon serves we
[30:22] would see jesus he says divine healing
[30:24] is not done by a man
[30:26] did not jesus even himself said i could
[30:28] do nothing except my father show me i
[30:30] say what he tells me to say i do what i
[30:32] see him do divine healing is not done by
[30:34] a man divine healing is the finished
[30:36] product
[30:37] only thing that a minister can do is
[30:39] preach the word that ought to be
[30:40] sufficient that ought to settle it
[30:45] that ought to be sufficient
[30:47] that you who are sick to say look the
[30:50] promise is by his stripes we are healed
[30:54] that that would seem to be sufficient
[30:56] because all a minister can do a minister
[30:58] can't heal you
[31:00] i i i can preach on blue in the face
[31:02] today and get really lathered up and
[31:03] real sweaty
[31:05] and i could speak with tongues and the
[31:07] music could be just right and just
[31:08] almost like mesmer just mesmerizing us
[31:11] with the music and everything and i can
[31:12] kind of shake my hands and crack my
[31:13] knuckles and say come up here i'm going
[31:15] to bless you i couldn't heal one of you
[31:19] the only thing i could do is preach the
[31:20] word
[31:25] and he says that that ought to be
[31:26] sufficient
[31:28] brother bram said the devil fights this
[31:30] wonderful truth of divine healing and
[31:32] marks it up
[31:34] so maybe it would be enough if we didn't
[31:36] have a devil
[31:38] like if he'd just given up you know when
[31:40] christ died and was rose again he goes i
[31:43] blew it
[31:44] you know i've been waiting for this to
[31:45] happen ever since god said the seat of
[31:47] the woman would bruise my head and i
[31:49] blew it and i walked right into the trap
[31:50] and i'm defeated and there's nothing i
[31:52] can do and if you just kind of left it
[31:54] alone and we just kind of had this
[31:56] liberty just to take god at his word but
[31:58] the devil has gummed it up
[32:00] he's marked it up
[32:04] look dropping back to the fundamentals
[32:06] here well let me just i think maybe this
[32:08] is where i might want to skip a little
[32:10] bit
[32:23] let's just let's look at let's go to
[32:25] mark chapter 16. i know i'm skipping
[32:26] several slides but i i'm leaving off
[32:29] quite a bit here
[32:31] i'm not even sure why i'm doing this i
[32:32] just feel impressed
[32:34] uh to
[32:37] to skip a few things here
[32:42] because we have this the thought is
[32:45] that it's a promise made in the word of
[32:47] god
[32:48] and
[32:49] preaching the word of god ought to be
[32:50] sufficient
[32:51] so in mark chapter 16 verses 14 to 20 we
[32:54] would maybe read this as the great
[32:55] commission
[32:56] afterward he appeared into the eleven as
[32:58] they sat at meat and upgraded them with
[32:59] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[33:02] because they believed not them which had
[33:03] been seen
[33:05] which had seen him after he was risen
[33:08] again you could just look at that
[33:09] dynamic that he has risen and he's seen
[33:12] of some and the some testify and they
[33:14] don't believe
[33:16] and upon what basis did he want them to
[33:18] believe that they said so
[33:21] right
[33:22] and it wasn't just something they made
[33:24] up not only was it something they had
[33:26] seen but it was something that he had
[33:28] told them before that he would do
[33:30] that he would raise again after three
[33:32] days he'd given him that promise so
[33:34] here's some testifying you remember how
[33:36] he said that he would raise he has risen
[33:38] indeed and without them seeing it think
[33:41] well i mean i guess
[33:43] i kind of would have want to see him
[33:44] myself but he says he uprated them for
[33:46] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[33:47] because they didn't believe those that
[33:49] had testified of his resurrection
[33:51] according to his promise
[33:53] and he said unto them
[33:55] go ye into all the world and preach the
[33:56] gospel to every creature
[34:00] and the gospel is
[34:01] is the very thing that they didn't
[34:03] believe
[34:05] right the christ crucified for our sins
[34:08] rose on the third day
[34:10] and is this
[34:11] and this this is the gospel the gospel
[34:13] of christ he says now you're going to go
[34:14] into all the world and preach the gospel
[34:16] to every creature
[34:17] the power of the gospel is the gospel
[34:21] the word of god has power in it
[34:23] as he was teaching there was power
[34:24] present to heal them all this is there
[34:26] was there was a power there just in the
[34:29] word of god just in preaching the gospel
[34:31] there's power
[34:38] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[34:40] be saved he that believeth what the
[34:42] gospel
[34:44] go preach the gospel he that believes
[34:46] the gospel and is baptized shall be
[34:47] saved and he that believeth not shall be
[34:49] damned notice it says nothing of baptism
[34:53] because he that believeth truly
[34:54] believeth will be baptized and will be
[34:56] saved and then he that believeth not
[34:57] doesn't matter how wet he gets he can't
[34:59] be saved
[35:01] and it says and these signs shall follow
[35:03] them that believe remember we made this
[35:06] statement where or we mentioned the
[35:07] statement only a minister all he can do
[35:08] is preach and that ought to be
[35:09] sufficient thought to settle it but the
[35:11] devil fights this wonderful truth and
[35:12] divine healing she says and these signs
[35:14] shall follow them that believe in my
[35:17] name shall they cast out devils they
[35:18] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[35:20] take up serpents and if they drink in
[35:22] the deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[35:24] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[35:26] they shall
[35:28] recover
[35:30] so they that believed were going to go
[35:32] into all the world and preach the gospel
[35:34] and preach in the gospel it was to cause
[35:36] others to hear the word of god and
[35:38] believe upon him and be saved and then
[35:41] there's signs also that follow the
[35:43] believer
[35:45] casting out devils speaking with new
[35:46] tongues taking up serpents
[35:49] drinking neatly deadly thing and it not
[35:51] hurt them
[35:52] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[35:54] they shall recover
[35:56] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[35:58] them he was received up in heaven
[36:00] and sat on the right hand of god and
[36:02] they went forth
[36:03] and preached everywhere the lord working
[36:06] with them and confirming the word with
[36:09] signs following
[36:11] so the goal of any preaching is to
[36:13] instigate faith in jesus christ
[36:15] that's the reason why we preach he that
[36:17] believeth he preached the gospel he that
[36:19] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[36:22] so there has to be a hearing of the word
[36:24] of god to instigate faith in jesus
[36:26] christ to receive him and then in
[36:27] believing be baptized in the name of
[36:29] jesus christ
[36:30] and and you shall receive the gift of
[36:32] the holy ghost therein lies the
[36:34] salvation the sealing of the soul and it
[36:36] has to happen uh by the word being
[36:38] preached
[36:41] now as humans especially with as much
[36:43] pride as we take in our words and our
[36:45] thoughts
[36:46] we would say well if if you don't
[36:48] believe me that's fine
[36:50] and in some ways we recognize that jesus
[36:53] upgrading them for their unbelief he
[36:54] says he's risen and he appears unto some
[36:57] of the disciples they run back and say
[36:58] he's risen he's risen he's risen like i
[37:01] don't trust you
[37:03] and if it was us we'd like fine don't
[37:05] believe me
[37:06] right wait a minute am i the only one
[37:09] that might do that
[37:10] i think a lot of us probably think that
[37:12] way that well if you don't trust me fine
[37:14] you know if you don't believe me fine
[37:16] because we take we just think well i see
[37:17] it i believe it i'm trustworthy i you
[37:20] ought to trust me you don't have any
[37:21] reason not to believe me and we would
[37:22] think that our word would be enough just
[37:25] take me at my word that should be enough
[37:27] if you don't believe me fine but god
[37:30] in his grace
[37:32] and his understanding of human nature
[37:34] takes it a step further and even though
[37:36] he might upgrade us for unbelief to not
[37:39] take
[37:40] him at his word he goes a step further
[37:43] and he says i will go ahead and confirm
[37:45] my presence with signs following
[37:51] we read this statement in the very
[37:52] beginning now the initial and original
[37:54] way to receive any redemptive blessing
[37:55] is by hearing the word of god because
[37:58] faith cometh by hearing hearing the word
[37:59] of god like ministers preach
[38:03] if that were you and i that would be
[38:05] sufficient
[38:07] if the people didn't want to believe us
[38:08] why we would just let them go on
[38:11] but god is so good and so full of mercy
[38:13] to after all that he sent his word then
[38:16] he sent gifts into the church
[38:21] there's sufficient enough evidence in
[38:23] the bible to say that god's a healer we
[38:25] could just have the example of hezekiah
[38:28] the example of abraham the examples in
[38:30] the in the lifting up of the brass
[38:32] serpent we could just look back and say
[38:34] well god hears the cries of his people
[38:36] god will answer prayer with abimelech
[38:38] abraham prayed and god healed him with
[38:40] hezekiah he prayed and god healed him
[38:42] and and we can say well that should be
[38:44] enough but god takes it a step further
[38:47] and he gives signs and gifts into the
[38:48] church
[38:50] the sermon jehovah jireh i've got
[38:51] perfect confidence in you as my brethren
[38:54] i know you're men of god called of god
[38:56] this is at the end of service and what
[38:57] he's doing is actually calling a prayer
[38:59] line he's having them line up on each
[39:01] side he's going to perform two lines for
[39:03] or
[39:04] for people to pass through
[39:06] and and maybe just the typical prayer
[39:08] line that you might be used to and he's
[39:10] having different ministers of god come
[39:12] and stand up and they're going to be the
[39:14] ones that are going to extend their
[39:15] hands they're going to be the ones that
[39:16] are laying hands on the sick they're
[39:17] going to be the ones that are praying
[39:19] and he says i have confidence in you men
[39:22] i'm trying to let this audience know
[39:25] that they don't have to wait for
[39:26] somebody to come by some special gift
[39:29] gifts don't heal gifts only declare god
[39:34] why because there's no such thing as
[39:35] some super-duper divine healer
[39:38] that even when god can genuinely move
[39:41] behind a man of god move behind an
[39:43] evangelist move in a particular ministry
[39:45] demonstrate many wonderful things people
[39:47] can get their eye on the man that god is
[39:50] using they can get their eye on the one
[39:52] who has the gift for your benefit and
[39:54] they look at that and he says i want to
[39:56] break us out of this mindset that you've
[39:58] got to wait on this cycle of annual
[40:00] meetings annual camps or a particular
[40:03] minister to come by or an evangelist or
[40:05] go visit some particular place so that
[40:07] you can receive your heal and he says
[40:09] gifts don't heal gifts only declare god
[40:12] you're ministers you know the word a lot
[40:14] better than i do so your gift is to do
[40:16] that that's the original way believe his
[40:19] word he sent his word and healed them
[40:23] that's the way it's supposed to be
[40:27] but then god's so good
[40:29] and makes such promises
[40:31] if they can't believe the word then he
[40:34] shows them a sign that it's him there
[40:37] that's what it's for
[40:39] that's the reason i have you here
[40:43] just preaching the word ought to
[40:44] accomplish it
[40:46] that would be the original way just by
[40:47] preaching the word of god he's a healer
[40:49] he's a healer and you sitting there
[40:50] would say oh i believe i believe god i
[40:53] heal and receive your healing even as
[40:55] the word is going forth that would be
[40:57] the the the best way uh to be healed
[41:01] in one place brother branham says that
[41:03] uh mr argenbright said to me that's
[41:05] number seven in the prayer cards was
[41:07] already healed while i was preaching
[41:09] he says praise the lord that's good
[41:10] that's the original way
[41:12] that's his way of doing it preaching the
[41:14] word and that's the way to do it
[41:16] preaching the word and to get healed by
[41:17] preaching god sent his word and what did
[41:20] it do it healed them that's right that's
[41:22] good
[41:24] so the ultimate is not even healing the
[41:26] ultimate is the word
[41:30] he says may this audience now without
[41:31] any sign at all may they just receive
[41:34] the word you sent your word and healed
[41:36] them may the word of god find a place in
[41:37] every heart may they be healed everyone
[41:39] both spiritually and physically we ask
[41:41] in jesus name by what the word
[41:45] he speaks of divine healing being a
[41:47] finished work at calvary and a minister
[41:49] that's taught in the word he can stand
[41:51] up and preach the word to you now if he
[41:52] preaches the word faith comes by hearing
[41:55] hearing the word of god that's the
[41:57] original
[42:00] so we can say that's the original way
[42:01] priest's word preached the word but then
[42:02] he says if they can't believe the word
[42:05] what mercy
[42:07] what grace
[42:09] do you realize just how legalistic we
[42:10] could get sometimes well man this word
[42:12] is perfect it's so clear god's a healer
[42:14] if you don't want to hear it i told you
[42:15] he's a healer then forget about it and
[42:17] walk away
[42:18] but god is so good that if they can't
[42:20] believe he shows them a sign that he's
[42:22] there
[42:23] that's what it's for
[42:27] we have to place these things right
[42:30] because we'll we'll even take certain
[42:31] things well that's just nothing but some
[42:32] sort of tradition and that's this and
[42:34] that's that and you don't even realize
[42:36] what it's there for
[42:38] they can't believe the word then he
[42:40] shows them a sign
[42:42] all right i hope i'm doing all right
[42:44] here with time
[42:47] first corinthians chapter 12 verses 28
[42:48] to 30.
[42:51] you let me know when i'm done
[42:57] it could be a risky proposition
[43:00] brother obed's gonna say all right
[43:01] brother aaron you're done
[43:03] [Laughter]
[43:05] first corinthians chapter 12 verses 28
[43:07] to 30.
[43:09] and god had set some in the church first
[43:11] apostles secondarily prophets thirdly
[43:12] teachers after that miracles
[43:15] then gifts of healing helps governments
[43:17] diversities of tongues are all apostles
[43:20] or all prophets or all teachers
[43:22] or all workers of miracles have all the
[43:24] gifts of healing do all speak with
[43:26] tongues do all interpret these are
[43:28] rhetorical questions what's the answer
[43:29] no they don't all do it
[43:32] but some do
[43:34] notice he has put gifts of healings in
[43:36] the church
[43:40] they're put there
[43:42] you could say well just take him at his
[43:43] word by his stripes we're healed just
[43:45] take him out of his word buy his stripes
[43:46] here but then god rich in mercy puts
[43:49] gifts in the church to bring up our
[43:51] faith in christ
[43:53] to build our faith if it's hard to
[43:54] believe if we've been a battle scarred
[43:56] and wounded we've suffered
[43:57] disappointments we've prayed and we
[43:59] didn't get what we asked for and it
[44:00] causes us just to be a little bit
[44:02] reluctant then god has a way of trying
[44:03] to woo us to believe and take him at his
[44:05] word and one of the ways he does is by
[44:07] declaring his presence amongst his
[44:09] people and if we just don't take him at
[44:11] his word he wants to show you that he's
[44:13] there for you
[44:15] he wants to start with you give you some
[44:17] basis to take him at his word some point
[44:19] of contact to see he made the promise
[44:21] and he healed us that's exactly what the
[44:23] brass serpent was
[44:24] they're grumbling they're complaining
[44:26] because of their complaining death
[44:28] enters into the camp but then god raises
[44:30] up a sign and inside that's lifted up so
[44:32] the people looking upon her healed and
[44:34] it would cause them to recognize lord
[44:36] forgive us for our grumbling forgive us
[44:38] for railing against you forgive us for
[44:39] our complaining forgive us for wanting
[44:41] to go back that's what brought upon us
[44:43] these serpents but you provided a way of
[44:45] escape and we looked at it and that they
[44:47] would glorify god not worship the
[44:50] serpent
[44:52] gifts of healings he says do all have
[44:54] gifts of healing we know they don't
[44:58] brother branham in the sermon looking
[44:59] unto jesus this very unique statement he
[45:01] says you know what the gift of healing
[45:03] is faith in healing
[45:06] see you just release your faith to pray
[45:08] for somebody that's all the gift of
[45:10] healing is
[45:13] again it's not some kind of
[45:16] right
[45:17] come over here
[45:19] i'm gonna touch your knee
[45:21] all right
[45:22] or just put this rabbit rabbit tail
[45:25] under your arm
[45:26] and and a pinch of toad liver under your
[45:28] tongue and then i'm gonna you know slap
[45:31] you on your forehead and all of a sudden
[45:32] you're gonna get well that's not a
[45:34] that's not a gift of healing
[45:36] a gift of healing is just to believe
[45:39] that's what a gift of healing is and
[45:41] certain people have it
[45:44] there's there's ones i've heard this
[45:45] even testified by other men of god that
[45:47] brother ernest fulcher in virginia has
[45:50] just a a gift of praying
[45:52] that that there's those that testify if
[45:54] they were ever sick they're calling him
[45:56] up and asking him to pray because he
[45:58] believes that god's a healer
[46:00] absolutely convinced of it and it's all
[46:03] based on faith and so a gift of healing
[46:05] is to believe that when i pray for you
[46:07] you're going to get well
[46:09] he says every minister should have it
[46:13] every minister should have a gift of
[46:15] healing why he should be absolutely
[46:16] convinced that god's a healer and he
[46:18] says everybody see should have gift of
[46:21] healing
[46:23] so paul asking do all have gifts of
[46:25] healing we realize we all don't but
[46:27] maybe we all should
[46:29] if he could save your soul certainly
[46:31] could heal your body
[46:32] he said he says the power that heals you
[46:34] is on the inside of you the holy spirit
[46:37] you just have to let it work its way out
[46:39] that's all
[46:42] it's not the man who's the healer
[46:43] there's no man with divine healing but a
[46:45] man can have such confidence in the word
[46:47] of god that when he prays for you it you
[46:49] you have confidence that god's going to
[46:51] hear his prayer and that that prayer is
[46:53] going to deliver you and release you and
[46:55] make you well
[46:56] but what happens when someone has a gift
[46:58] of healing they turn that one who has
[47:00] the gift of healing into the healer and
[47:02] they make an idol out of them
[47:04] and they put more emphasis on the man's
[47:07] words or the man's faith instead of the
[47:09] word of god that built his own faith
[47:14] brother branham when he's taking
[47:16] questions and answers on the seals he
[47:17] says just look what the little gift of
[47:18] divine healing is a gift of healing has
[47:20] done come on his own ministry he says
[47:22] how it confused the church everybody had
[47:24] a sensation everybody had this this is
[47:26] when ministries began to rise up and
[47:28] different tremendous healing ministries
[47:30] begin to sweep the nation everybody else
[47:32] wanted to have something sensational or
[47:34] super-duper
[47:36] and instead of the attention being on
[47:37] the word of god or the attention being
[47:39] on christ it gets more drawn to the
[47:40] ministries and that's what a gift of
[47:42] healing can do when you get your eyes on
[47:44] the one that has the gift instead of the
[47:45] one who gave the gift
[47:48] and the focus just strays from the word
[47:50] it strays from the promise to the
[47:52] natural part and that's where i'm using
[47:54] the phrase it becomes anecdotal faith
[47:57] because you look at the particular
[47:59] instance in which god heals somebody and
[48:01] go oh so you came in a prayer line and
[48:04] brother so and so
[48:06] prayed for you and all the ministers
[48:08] were praying for you and waymaker was
[48:10] being played and it was on a saturday
[48:12] night and they're like oh i can't wait
[48:15] for that next time that that brother is
[48:18] having a prayer line in a particular
[48:19] meeting and they could be plain waymaker
[48:22] and i can be prayed for and they don't
[48:24] see the promise that god made to heal
[48:26] and what a gift of healing is they look
[48:28] at all the other anecdotal evidence
[48:30] related to it and their faith becomes
[48:32] anecdotal because it's so fixated on the
[48:34] particular instance
[48:36] that's how we build idols
[48:38] that's how we turn think promises of god
[48:40] into traditions and jesus says you've
[48:42] made god the word of god a nun effect
[48:44] through your tradition because you made
[48:46] the thing itself the thing
[48:48] when the thing was supposed to testify
[48:50] of christ it should just be a brass
[48:52] thing but you make it an idol
[48:56] we put the emphasis on the specific
[48:58] outward manifestation instead of the
[49:00] actual word
[49:02] something supernatural can take place oh
[49:04] so that's how it happened that's what
[49:05] took place and then what we want is we
[49:07] want to see the same manifestation for
[49:09] some sort of vindication or some sort of
[49:11] evidence
[49:13] i know it's a much larger thought but i
[49:14] just keep mentioning it we have to be
[49:16] careful that our faith isn't anecdotal
[49:18] based specifically on the way god moved
[49:20] in someone's life instead of the promise
[49:23] that they were relying upon to see god
[49:25] move
[49:26] james chapter 5 verses 14 to
[49:29] he says there's any sick among you
[49:32] let him call for the elders of the
[49:34] church and let them pray over him
[49:35] anointing him with oil in the name of
[49:37] the lord
[49:40] this is in the bible
[49:43] laying hands on this and anointing the
[49:45] sick with oil if someone is sick call
[49:47] the elders let them pray for him anoint
[49:48] him with oil and the prayer of faith
[49:50] shall save the sick and the lord shall
[49:53] raise him up
[49:55] and if he committed sins they shall be
[49:56] forgiven him confess your faults one to
[49:58] another and pray one for another that ye
[50:00] may be healed the effectual fervent
[50:03] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[50:06] this is a promise given in the word of
[50:08] god paul says there's gifts of healing
[50:10] in the church james says that you should
[50:11] call for the elders when one is sick
[50:13] anoint the sick with oil and pray and
[50:16] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[50:18] and the lord shall raise them up a clear
[50:20] prescription in the word of god that
[50:21] when one is sick you can ask for prayer
[50:23] you can be anointed with oil
[50:25] the prayer of faith can be prayed and
[50:27] it's that prayer faith that will raise
[50:28] them up he says pray for one another
[50:30] that you may be healed and it's the
[50:31] effectual fervent prayer
[50:34] of a righteous man that availeth much
[50:38] this wasn't just given to james it
[50:39] wasn't just given dispensationally to
[50:41] the apostles it's a promise in the word
[50:43] of god that we can look to today
[50:47] but the healing's not in the oil
[50:50] right
[50:52] the healing's not even in the hands
[50:55] the healing's not even the prayer
[50:57] the healing's in the faith
[51:00] in mark chapter six verse five he said
[51:02] he could do there no mighty work
[51:05] save that he laid his hands upon a few
[51:07] sick folk and healed them exactly how
[51:09] it's written upon a few sick folk
[51:11] and healed them christ in his own
[51:13] ministry laid his hands on the sick and
[51:14] they were healed then later on in that
[51:17] same chapter verses 12 and 13 he sends
[51:18] out the disciples and they went out and
[51:20] preached that men should repent
[51:22] and they cast out many devils and
[51:24] anointed many with oil anointed with oil
[51:27] many that were sick and healed them
[51:29] this is demonstrated in jesus ministry
[51:32] laying hands on the sick demonstrated in
[51:34] the apostles ministry in the days of
[51:36] christ's own ministry before he gives
[51:37] them the great commission later in mark
[51:39] chapter 16 he's preaching these things
[51:42] sends them out they preach the word of
[51:43] god they cast out devils anoint with oil
[51:45] and see the sick are healed
[51:48] jesus in luke 13 13. he laid his hands
[51:50] on her and immediately she was made
[51:52] straight
[51:54] so we could see it in the word of god
[52:00] but even in that it's based on the word
[52:03] our confidence that that would happen is
[52:05] based on the word otherwise we might
[52:07] want the apostles to come back
[52:09] or we need jesus physically here to here
[52:11] to lay his hands on us but it's
[52:12] something deeper than that
[52:15] i i got just a few more statements and
[52:17] then we'll close from that time brother
[52:18] branham says divine healing isn't based
[52:20] on some mental tantrum
[52:24] that's a
[52:25] that's a mindful isn't it
[52:27] divine healing is based on some mental
[52:29] tantrum
[52:30] i don't know what that means to you but
[52:32] man i'd like i could just think on that
[52:34] for a while what is a what is a mental
[52:35] tantrum get yourself worked up
[52:38] does it have to be some sort of
[52:39] enthusiasm some kind of mental uh
[52:41] excitement
[52:42] neither is it based upon some out of
[52:45] some oil of somebody's hands
[52:47] or some hocus pocus
[52:49] divine healing is based upon the shed
[52:52] blood of jesus christ the atonement he
[52:54] was wounded for our transgressions and
[52:56] with the stripes we were healed so it's
[52:58] upon the atonement
[53:00] and as long as we try to achieve a
[53:02] church for god we're going contrary
[53:05] against his will we must let the spirit
[53:07] come into our lives and take our lives
[53:09] and let him have his way in our heart
[53:12] that's the ultimate you wouldn't even
[53:14] want to see divine healing in your
[53:16] church just so you can build a church
[53:18] you wouldn't want to have people being
[53:20] healed just so you could gain a
[53:21] following you want god to vindicate his
[53:24] presence amongst his people that the
[53:26] people's hearts would be led by him and
[53:29] that he would take over their lives
[53:32] a miracle should declare god's presence
[53:36] and it draws something to god it doesn't
[53:37] vindicate a person doesn't indicate
[53:39] hands doesn't vindicate doterra or young
[53:42] living it just vindicates god's presence
[53:44] amongst his people and that someone in
[53:46] their heart would want to
[53:48] have him take over their life
[53:51] and him have a way in their heart
[53:53] so it's not based on a mental tantrum
[53:55] it's not based upon oil in someone's
[53:57] hands it's not a hocus pocus it's based
[53:59] upon the blood of jesus christ
[54:02] the sermon be not afraid to desire
[54:04] divine healing is not based upon some
[54:06] emotion
[54:08] it's not based upon some laying on of
[54:10] hands
[54:12] or some strange feeling or sensation
[54:14] it's based upon a faith in a work that
[54:17] was done for you by jesus christ at
[54:19] calvary it is a finished product and
[54:22] every person here tonight that's sick
[54:24] and afflicted as far as god is concerned
[54:26] you are already healed
[54:35] we believe in the power of god to heal
[54:36] just by based upon what's in the old
[54:38] testament
[54:40] we believe god's a healer because the
[54:41] word said so he says i am the lord that
[54:43] healeth thee
[54:46] and god
[54:48] sent his word and healed them
[54:52] and he could have just left it at that
[54:53] right
[54:54] but he takes it one step further
[54:57] that if if you are unable or if you are
[54:59] not taking him at his word to be healed
[55:02] then you can ask someone to pray for you
[55:06] they can anoint you with oil
[55:07] lay hands it's still the word of god
[55:10] right
[55:11] we believe that god will honor prayer we
[55:14] believe god will honor the laying on of
[55:15] hands we believe that god will honor the
[55:17] anointing with oil because the bible
[55:19] says so
[55:21] this is the promise of god this is in
[55:22] the word of god if someone's sick have
[55:24] the the elders come and pray for them
[55:26] and it's all meant to do what build up
[55:29] your faith in god
[55:31] because it's a promise in the word of
[55:33] god this isn't some hocus pocus it isn't
[55:35] some mental tantrum
[55:37] i i i couldn't tell any of you if any of
[55:39] you have a headache today then i want
[55:41] you to come up here and just bang your
[55:42] head on the wall seven times and you're
[55:44] gonna watch that headache go away
[55:46] you'd have no place to base that on
[55:49] oh so you're telling me your knee hurts
[55:51] well let me just stab you in the back uh
[55:53] you're worried about your knee now
[55:56] there's no there's those are just
[55:57] distractions there's nothing to it we
[55:59] don't we're not looking for a placebo
[56:01] effect in the house of god
[56:04] we can actually take god at his word he
[56:06] was he's gracious enough to say that i
[56:10] sent my word and then i'm going to
[56:11] vindicate my word with signs following
[56:14] in order to do what not become make us
[56:16] sign seekers
[56:18] but that the sign would get us to
[56:20] believe in him
[56:22] not that we would have idols and super
[56:24] duper healers and
[56:26] and work up of mental tantrums and some
[56:28] emotions and and get so fixated on the
[56:31] lane of hands but that we will believe
[56:32] christ is our healer
[56:38] so the basis for divine healing is the
[56:40] word
[56:44] our faith that god is a healer ought to
[56:45] be rooted in the word
[56:49] i'll read this i'm going to read one
[56:51] last statement musicians if you could
[56:52] come
[56:53] let me just read the statement from the
[56:54] queen of sheba
[56:59] because if the brass serpent
[57:00] can become an idol
[57:04] then even the man who's got a gift of
[57:05] healing can become an idol
[57:09] or the prayer line can become an idol
[57:12] the laying on of hands and the anointing
[57:14] oil can all become idols
[57:16] and he says now i'm what i'm trying to
[57:17] get the american people to see
[57:19] you don't have to wait for a special
[57:22] time
[57:23] for a certain evangelist to come through
[57:24] and pray for you
[57:26] your pastor is sufficient
[57:29] if your pastor isn't there your
[57:30] neighbor's sufficient
[57:33] if your neighbor isn't there your
[57:34] husband your wife is sufficient
[57:37] and if none of them's there just raise
[57:39] up your hands
[57:40] he's sufficient always
[57:42] do you see how god's willing to meet us
[57:44] on whatever level
[57:46] that's why we you you should never
[57:48] preach against we should never cause you
[57:50] to be suspicious of hands being laid on
[57:52] you never want to be suspicious of a
[57:54] prayer line you should never be
[57:55] suspicious of oh oil being someone being
[57:58] anointed with oil you say oh well the
[57:59] gentile way is to take him at his word
[58:02] well
[58:02] not all gentiles believe in christ
[58:05] i'm not wanting to just take the gentile
[58:07] away i want to take his way his provided
[58:09] way and if that's the ultimate of the
[58:12] bride's faith you can't just expect me
[58:14] to get there if all i am is a gentile
[58:17] the only way i could ever get to that
[58:18] bride level of faith is to see god
[58:20] confirm his promised word on every
[58:22] promise in the word of god
[58:25] and there's a lot of people that need to
[58:26] meet him at the altar they need to meet
[58:28] him in a prayer line they need to meet
[58:29] him with hands being laid on they need
[58:30] to meet him with the oil being laid on
[58:32] because it's all in the word of god but
[58:34] ultimately what you would desire for
[58:35] them to see is that the same god who met
[58:38] me at the altar the same god who met me
[58:40] in the prayer line it's the same god
[58:42] when that evangelist came through it's
[58:44] the same god in my pastor but if my
[58:46] pastor's not there it's the same god and
[58:47] the neighbor next to you
[58:50] and if the neighbor's not next to you if
[58:51] it's just your wife your wife can pray
[58:53] for you he said they are sufficient but
[58:55] if there's none of them there
[58:59] he's sufficient always
[59:01] just wherever you are believe it believe
[59:03] it it's
[59:05] a finished
[59:06] work
[59:08] amen let's stand
