TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Lord willing this morning we'll wrap up um at least in titling uh the series on the kingdom as we've been looking at Heaven's mystery Earth's glory and I'd like to just use the title this morning is Kingdom Builders and this is part three I think this is a wonderful place just to transition to some other things that the Lord's been dealing with me on and uh wanted to kind of be not climactic necessarily but kind of some summing up some things and just uh wrapping up a lot of different thoughts that we've been laying out through these several services and over the last several um services that we've had together on this subject we've been looking at how the the Earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord and we know that that has application in the future home but then we begin to see by the scripture there's this remarkable uh application of these scriptures uh to the Millennium and this time of the reign of Christ with his bride for a thousand years on Earth and we were using how that in the Millennium the things that will take place in the Millennium before the Earth is completely renovated by by fire baptism is a type of the spirit in us now indwelling Us and how that we being in the spirit can be filled with wisdom and knowledge and understanding and Revelation and emphasizing the importance of understanding and Revelation and so I'd like to just pick up right there on Revelation and maybe just seed for the next few minutes some other things that we've been mentioning through the last service so kind of all get on the same page and then we'll just try to wrap this up with a nice big bow on it just in time for the holiday season and in Matthew 16: 18 Christ had asked them uh who do men say that I am and there was a lot of speculation as to who Christ was and some surmised he was different prophets a great man a great teacher and then when he ask the question very pointedly well who do you say that I am Peter in responding Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus is pointing out that he says well Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this to you you didn't figure this out you didn't hear it from some somebody else we could even say that he didn't learn it even from demons as they were cast out who might have exclaimed oh you're the the Messiah or the Christ he this was not something he took away externally but something that had been quickened inside of him and the father had revealed it to him and Jesus's response to that Dynamic it's such an incredible statement he says and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter this and that's speaking of a rock that he himself was going to be a rock that by revelation he became a building material he became a part of a foundation and Upon This Rock which is revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it there is nothing of of such prevailing power as Revelation not exclamation but Revelation there is nothing as much as prevailing power it's the most powerful thing there is is revelation it's what we ought to call upon the Lord for more than anything is revelation and so this is what Jesus is saying is everything I will build my church on Revelation so that tells us the foundation is the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's Jesus Christ that's doing the building so it's the building of Jesus Christ and he uses Revelation to lay the foundation and he's going to use Revelation to lift the structure up and all hell is against Revelation and all hell is against this Revelation he says I I build Upon This Rock I'll build my church and I'm going to give you the keys of the kingdom and so hell is against the knowledge to open up the power of the Kingdom that's what the devil wants to confuse and interrupt if he could just keep you from getting Revelation true Revelation which brother says the importance of true Revelation in a believer's life and I'm just kind of paraphrasing cannot be over overemphasized the importance of true Revelation in a believer's life that so it's something that's very very important to us and brother Bram writes that the true Revelation is God in interpreting his own word by vindicating what is Promised so there's a you can't say I got a revelation I got a revelation but it has to be God a true Revelation is God interpreting has to be the word interpreted by Vindication and the manifestation is the Vindication and you miss it without Revelation right you might be on a spiritual vacation which will be followed by a lot of lamentation if you don't get the Revelation and so true Revelation is God interpreting his word by vindicating what is promised and we read the statement from Satan's Eden and brother brandham says I heard brother Bram brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why I why why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't why didn't I do this he says here it is now it's when he says that it's interesting because he's acknowledging that he's not at least in the way I see this he's acknowledging that he doesn't preach on it like the person was asking other words why don't you preach on the Holy Ghost why don't you teach us how to do this and why don't you emphasize this and emphasize that a lot of times brother B said people wanted to be able to manifest the gifts and teach us how to do that and and and and work those things out and he say well how could I teach you that if you don't know your ABCs and so he says um here it is in other words okay I'll acknowledge that I'm not giving you what you think you want he says the Holy Ghost is the action in you amen it's a life not an emotion so maybe they were wanting these people were wanting to teach on the emotional side the physical side not some sort of Flesh evidence so maybe they wanted to see the gifts taught and and the gifts in manifestation but he's saying I don't emphasize that I emphasize the holy ghost in a person being an action called a life he says but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age that's what we want we want the Holy Ghost to Quicken every word of this age watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word because that's true Revelation true Revelation is God interpreting the his own word by vindicating what is promised he interprets it by bringing it to pass he vindicates it by manifesting it and so we want the Holy Ghost In Action what does that mean the word coming to pass in my life life lived by the word is the word expressed and so Revelation is how God builds us into a Powerhouse you want to know how that we're built into a power Power House of God he does it by revelation we become the PowerHouse of his indwelling Spirit as Revelation establishes us upon a foundation and builds us up into the stature of Christ Peter said we are Lively stones and are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so you are a living Stone you are a living element in the body of Christ and you are built up yourself as a spiritual house the Bible says you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost so that's where the kingdom is it's in the hearts of men now I hope this will be kind of a good transition to go forward we'll review quickly these scriptures we read in Proverbs Proverbs chap 24: 3 4 and 5 it says through wisdom is a house builded so a house is built by wisdom by understanding it is established so if we could think in terms of the house is built by wisdom and then it's made firm and its longevity and its strength lies in understanding you following me can build a house but there's there's a way that you you build it in a way that it lasts or you preserve it you keep it so it last and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches so there's a building of it there's a keeping of it and then there's a filling of it wisdom builds it understanding establishes it and then knowledge is is going to fill it with good things that's a template for our lives that's a template for a church that's a template for our homes that wisdom will build the house understanding will establish it and knowledge will fill it with all the right things a wise man is strong in other words knowledge is power a man of knowledge increases strength and this is looking at the structure something that is built we're looking at the the I the the thought of Kingdom Builders that wisdom is what builds understands what establishes knowledge is what FS it so we never want to downplay the importance of revelation we never want to stop seeking after wisdom we want to desire uh understanding and the knowledge of the word of God that's what Paul taught us on the fullness of these things and to desire these things and the prayer that he had for us it says in Proverbs Chapter n wisdom hath builded her house she hath heun out her Seven Pillars God's word we know is his power it is his wisdom and we looked into the scripture and we saw that how God by his wisdom created the heavens and the Earth and God by his power established and created and so the wisdom of God creates the power of God is something that orders it erects it builds this is something that God's word does he says my word will not return void so the word is effective the word does something it accomplishes something the word's just not something that's just there and go we'll eat the word the word the word the word manifest the word accomplishes the word does things don't let anyone lie to you and turn word only into nothing but letter but if we believe the word only that means there's power in it there's life in it there there's Resurrection in it there's healing in it there's salvation in it and so we believe in a word that has power we believe in a word that has life because the word of God is something that creates where there is nothing is something that preserves what is created when it had not been before and it will build and it erect and it'll establish and and it'll order by his wisdom so it says wisdom have built her house and this and heun out her Seven Pillars that word seven is to speak of completeness there's ways that you could type that to the the fruit of the spirit and a lot of different elements that kind of tie together but the pillars speak of something that is guiding and supporting something something sets upon a pillar it's raised something up so this is the it's she's he out Seven Pillars uh if we if you want to look at in terms of building a house uh these are things that are supporting the structure I'm going to preserve it against flood and earthquake and shifting of Sands and and and the and the water and rock and whatever might happen it's something to make it firm and establish it and so the pillars uh guide and support and build up and it and it says it's heun it out it's divided it it's cut it out and it's used in the sense of a Mason that cuts out a stone to be fit into a building so wisdom hath heed out the pillars shape them place them to hold things up to give the structure its support this is what wisdom does separates out it divides out it it crafts and it builds wisdom is a builder in 1st Samuel chap 2: 7 and8 now I think I just maybe have one more uh quote to use to kind of tie in from one of these prior services but this here is going to be a very important part uh for the remaining of our time together this morning and 1st Samuel chapter 2: 7 and 8 the Lord maketh I just want you to think of his his activity the Lord maketh poor and maketh Rich he bringeth low and lifteth up he raiseth up the poor Out of the Dust I like this says he makes the poor but then he lifts the poor Out of the Dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dung Hill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory wow what a statement this is Hannah and Her prayer before the Lord when she's beseeching him with this painful desire for a son and for a child and being mocked and and desirous and pleading she's talking about God's character and what she's witnessed and the Lord makes the poor but then he raises the poor Out of the Dust he lifts the beggar from the dungill to set them the beggar the poor among princes to make them inherit the Throne of Glory what prophecy what great utterance and it says for The Pillars of the Earth are the Lords and Heath set the world upon them when it says wisdom hath builded her house and sheath heun out her Seven Pillars we could see that even the word the Earth is Anem is emblematic of this house that wisdom builds and that the the wisdom uh that builds is connected with creation and he says that the pillars of the Earth are the Lords so there's something in the earth that is the Lords that he's hun out that he's fashioned that he's framed in his wisdom and he sets the world upon those pillars that's what guides it that's what keeps it up that's what gives it purpose and meaning these pillars as she uses it in this word in the Hebrew this this molten column or support maybe there is something she's thinking about in the earth uh the support comes the molten lava the structure of the earth that is holding the crust up and keeping everything in it shape or its form he says that God's wisdom established the world on these firm pillars amen doesn't collapse in upon itself it's not just free flow and it's not chaotic but God has set this and established it on his by his wisdom on these pillars and remember the whole theme in this the Earth holds the mystery of Heaven this creation of the Earth this creation of the world holds the mystery of heaven and in the Earth was a hidden purpose there was a a supernatural purpose and a hidden glory in the earth though in creation we didn't see it but God is signaling it God is speaking of it and you're going to see even in the end something rise up out of the earth that was there by seed that God had visioned in the beginning God knew it was going to get there so it's been there from the very time that God created the Earth waiting for it to be revealed for that Eighth Day that's a remarkable a testimony that's a remarkable mystery and it's God's wisdom that created the Heaven and the Earth so it's God's wisdom that creates WID wisdom builds the house understanding establishes it knowledge fills it what those things those principles the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledge of God and we're using this as a template to look at ourselves this is what God does in me now in the sermon everpresent water from the rock this would be a good sermon maybe for some to go back and listen to if you feel inclined I'm just pulling from a few places in here that's just just so excellent he says we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that this is what I want you to see now as we've hopefully established just a few things in review there Sons and Daughters of God if there wasn't a law Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it and Sons and Daughters of God said amen right there wasn't a law we would create a world and live a private life on in other words he's saying you get away from here you have the power in you to do it amen and just to make the point he says if you got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it do we believe that the Chris it's nice to have you back didn't realize you'd be back so soon he was away in Ohio visiting being a grandpa I'm sure there there's there there's a power in a Believer now there's a power in us now to be able to speak speak and create another world now when we say create another world we might just think of another planet somewhere or an island somewhere in the tropics I don't know what you envision but it's the same creative power that God has is in you because he's related to the power of God so it's not your own power it's the power of God to create so you could create another world world and live a private life on it one that would seemingly be disconnected from any reality here and he he comes back to it in a a few statements later if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you so the power is there he says it's you with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there so there is a power in a born again son or daughter of God to create a world and live in it I says it's always there but our faith it's controlled by the law of faith and the reason why we can't create that world and that private life to live on is because it could only operate in faith you say Well then why can't I use it he says it's there you got to use it by faith amen Faith's resting place is the word of God Amen I hope today as we wrap this up I can give you a place for your faith to rest to create that world and now everybody's awake now we ministered a few subject services on Millennium preparation and how that the Earth is going to be purified for a millennium I hope this isn't too much of a hard turn here but the Earth is going to be purified for a millennium and brother BR saying the Earth renews herself so there's a baptism of fire that the whole Earth surface brother BR says that the Earth has changed and future home he really details that and that ushers in the Eighth Day the perfect Kingdom but before that before White Throne judgment after the first resurrection after tribulation there's a purging and a purifying the molten lava and the upheaval and the volcanics and the atomic bombs there's a purifying of the Earth and the Earth renews herself out then and and we're looking at that in in type for us as we can there's a purifying now that's taking place now there's a there's a purging there's a purifying then for the eighth day we know that God will change the World by fire to bring forth a new Heaven and a new Earth not a replacement but a regeneration a renewal now brother bam makes this statement in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride I've laid a foundation now hopefully we could just take a step into a very specific area here when he's talking about that purification and that renewal and the new Heaven and new earth coming forth for the eth day the future home he said it's only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's upon the Earth that'll be destroyed now the total Annihilation is of sin and death and all the wickedness and anything that would contaminate or pollute nothing can def nothing that can defile will be left we realize that the heaven Heavens means the atmospheres above what does it do if then these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits will be gone away and annihilated think of all the pollution in the world right now say it has to be done that way because we're going to live right here those are the things that have to go not the original spoken word attribute of God not the things that have Redemption remember there's no Redemption for hell therefore it ceased to exist There's No Redemption for sin so it ceased to exist but there's Redemption for this Earth and part of its Redemption process is to get rid of anything that polluted it anything that contaminated anything that keeps it from being the original so he says we're going to live right here we'll prove that by the Bible right here is where we live now notice thistles germs all sickness and things will be completely taken away all this it's existence that's in the earth now oh hopefully you can just start grabbing a hold this man-made systems politics sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and all the heavens above us is in here is contaminated with evil spirit right I know what's going to happen is most if not all of you going to get ahead of me and if you do you just amen me to the Finish Line you just drag me to where you already get and if you're getting there it's going to be exciting to see it he's saying now the world is contaminated with evil spirits politics man-made systems all kind of evil spirits now we're going to go deep and long in this I don't know we are but we're going to we're going to get into it he says all this exists in the heavens or atmospheres and the Earth which is now these things exist in the atmosphere sin politics evil spirits it's in the atmosphere it's around us it's in it's in these in these Realms around us the Earth holds these things but it wasn't made for that purpose and that's where he says and your bodies were laid in this earth right the Earth's purpose wasn't for sin it was to get a bride out of it says your bodies were all laiden here God's Building Material he's been Gathering that material is what he's saying here says the Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose it wasn't made to hold sin wasn't made to be contamined it wasn't made for politics it wasn't made for evil spirits sin caused it to be like that it was made by God the Creator so he's tying it back to something about God's nature to be a Creator and God made it in his wisdom and when he did he put pillars in it to hold it up so despite all the contamination nothing could collapse those pillars despite all the wickedness and sin and atomic bombs and everything that man can man could suck out all the oil out of it he could try to take all the water out of it he could try to mine all the minerals out of he could keep transforming its elements and building things out of it and using science and compositions to completely change all the elements in the earth and build something on the surface that changes what it originally looked like but God says nothing like that can change the Earth at its core in what its purposes and when God brings forth that Eighth Day brother B said it's the atmosph speres that are changed so God the creator creates a new atmosphere he said it's the atmospheres that take it's a total removal and annihilation of anything that contaminates it's bringing everything back to the original and this future home he's saying is connected with he points this out in more than just this one place it's connected with the perfect atmosphere now if I could just summarize a little bit on this subject of the Kingdom We Believe according to the word of the hour the kingdom is on on Earth today and is in Earth today and is in the hearts of his bride and this is part of Heaven's mystery the kingdom in Earth now and we mentioned I think the very first service first few Services how that we're inspired with the thought that there's this lie we call the the LIE of Catholicism that kind of divides and it's in nominal Christianity that divides eternity into hell in heaven and they say that hell is ET Eternal Heaven's Eternal in time in life that we exist in right now is merely is only a choosing place a to decide whether you'll spend eternity in Hell or eternity in heaven and with that kind of idea is kind of sets forth that well the the the heaven is the be all end all that's where you want to be and you want to avoid hell and kind of all we do on Earth is just make our choice and kind of guess wait till we get there and it when it divides eternity between two destinations I it it it adds with it the idea that Earth is going to be destroyed so here where we live right now is so temperat it's like ah this life it's a nothing right it's a nothing Burger it's going to be gone and you're going to end up in eternity and it's either going to be heaven or hell and kind in presenting that it really changes the reality of what this life is for and how important this life is and how one day we're going to come right back here and live again and we were hoping that we could bring some relevance considering what will be in eternity bring some relevance to what is now using this Plan of Redemption of the earth to see the Plan of Redemption our own lives make today more relevant to us and brother Bram says in Christ is the mystery God revealed we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life amen that's the kingdom the word of God made spirit and life andal life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God was one as it was in Christ so shall it be in US amen the way he was and the Word was one with him it's to be that way with the bride the kingdom is the word made spirit and life it is the Holy Ghost In Action in you not so much in demonstrations but fulfilling the word of God for this hour amen and the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day the kingdom is the unity the union of Heaven and Earth the unity of deity and flesh this is what we see embodied in the and in in the and the example of Christ Heaven and Earth embracing the bride is the Earth's Glory but she's the mystery of Heaven as she comes out of the earth as she's what God had hidden the Earth from the beginning God the creator has designed this God for that eighth day is going to create a perfect atmosphere and Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 2 and 3 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth then in the end we see new Heaven and new Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light in verse four we see that God he separates divides light from dark he separates this is what's transforming in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and though there might have been this chaotic form this amalgamation of things and indiscernible and darkness upon the Earth it's the spirit of God that moves and light comes forth and distinction comes and God separates light from dark we tou we touched on how the brother Bram said the one who created the Heaven and the Earth expresses himself through his creation what he is in his program so God who creates the Heaven and Earth expresses himself in Heaven and Earth his program is expressed in these things in the beginning when God created the Heaven and Earth and then shows this in verse two shows it in verse three shows it in verse four and we could go on and on and on God is expressing himself in the creation the kingdom of God as brother said science achieves Looking Backward God achieves going this way going forward to the kingdom God achieves by his word by Revelation by creation and he's always been achieving to the kingdom science achieves downward to death God achieves towards the Kingdom so God is expressing the kingdom in Genesis one I know this is review for us but I just wanted to lay that back in there to tie this together because then brother brandham says in God's power to transform in Genesis 1 this is just another part of the review the world was without form and it was void Darkness was upon the Earth nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of God moved upon on the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden think of how brother brand I'm talking about this world has man-made system politics sin all kinds of evil spirits contaminating the heavens the atmospheres think of that dimension of science that fourth dimension think of all these uh radio waves and all the sin and all the scars everything upon the Earth man-made creation and all the uh the the combustible engines and and all the electric cars and all the mechanic devices and all the screens think of all the things all the junkyards think of all the trash think of the ocean and all the litter and all the pollution and all the smog and everything that clings to the Earth all that is in it and brother Bram is saying here look at what God did to the Earth in its chaotic form in the entire picture was changed from Total Chaos to a Garden of Eden that's the transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of of it that's the transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and makees something wonderful out of it remember how we used that statement to show that in Peter Peter's talking about the world that was the world that became the world that was now showing us how After the flood these things change we can see that God transforms the world that then was in Genesis 1:2 to the Heaven and Earth which is which are now this transforming power bringing forth something new brother bham says is this or for some of you at least I can't say it's for everybody can you individually say all right I can see some pieces here this is moving along anybody feel that we got some pieces to work with here am he says brother says an attitude and who is God who is God the one that stood there and rolled Stars off his hands and rolls worlds out of his hands and made things which do not appear deity and deity himself lives in man amen the Creator that made heavens and earth lives in mankind the Bible said we are Sons and Daughters of God his offspring now then we're something like God was deity here with us deity in us this is what he's drawn from when he says that you could speak a world into existence and go live on it a private life on it why because deity is in you this one that creates this one that has power this one that has wisdom knowledge and understanding deity lives in man that's the king om God in you it is the spirit is the word of God made Spirit of life in our own life this is telling us that God the Eternal God the omnipotent God the omniscient lives in Me by the new birth lives in Me by the Holy Ghost I am a temple of God I am a temple of the Holy Ghost there's deity that lives in man and I know that we so often relate that only to Jesus Christ but he says it's to bring to pass every promise in this day as it did in the day when the word in God was one in other words as it was in Jesus Christ is to be in you now this this is just a small step but I'm taking a step forward hopefully you can follow me now in looking at the example of Jesus Christ he says but Jesus lived in a world that no one knew about he was an odd person now catch this because we're talking about Kingdom Builders and as we've been relating it to wisdom we wanted to connect that with God's power to create you could create a world and go live in it it's a power that lives in You Now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that there is that this that's what the kingdom is is God living in you and God is a Creator and when God created in the very beginning he took total chaos and transformed it into something wonderful something that was nothing and made something wonderful out of it that God lives in you that's what I wanted you to see this idea of creation this idea of power lives in US Jesus lived a world that no one knew about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was are you connecting some things here you controlled by a law have the power to create a world and go live in it now he says that Jesus lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then the people would begin to say you'd be a Mystic to them that's the way it is to all believers they are a Mystic the people don't understand listen because they live in a world to themselves they live in a world to themselves Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch I want to bring it down to Kingdom Builders today that if we've got power inside of us to create another world and go live a private life on it then we have the power to build the kingdom and live in it if Jesus lived in a world of perfect faith and the outside world didn't understand it why he was here on Earth in a dark time surrounded by haters surrounded by sin surrounded by unbelief surrounded by threats of death he lived in a world that the world knew nothing about he didn't have to go to another world he lived in a world right here that the world knew nothing about we can build the kingdom and live in it today I want to say to you create a world and live in it create a kingdom and live in it instead of instead of getting the idea well I'm just going to languish until Christ comes well Christ has come into my heart I don't want to languish I want to conquer I don't want to survive I want to overcome and I'm not just going to sit here and watch this one Fade Away what that would Fade Away lose my health lose my wife lose my happiness lose my joy I'm not going to lose any of it I've been given a promise by the word of God and I want it to rise up within me and I want to live in a world of perfect faith I want to do it right now we live in Leo DEA I know that no big Revelation maybe for some it is but we call it Satan's Eden we could track it through so many different scriptures and sermons that brother Brandon preached it's a wicked age of darkness and sin it's the darkest of all ages brother Brandon being hopeful maybe gave a little bit of light when he drew out the church ages but when the Holy Spirit revealed it blacked out giving multiple Witnesses of it Christ has been kicked out of the church you live in the darkest age has ever been a a conglomeration of evil an accumulation of sin permeating mankind it's in that way I feel that anymore we can't use we can't necessarily use history as an accurate predictor because it just keeps getting worse it it changing it's getting even uh the way things work say oh well it's always been this way it's always been this way no it's it's it's never been this bad that's right maybe there's nothing new Under the Sun but the there's going to be a cup that fills up there there's going to be a fullness of even the wickedness and we're in that time where the morals and everything is just completely decayed yes and now I want to I want to read this statement I've been listening to uh what house will you build me and brother brandom and I just want you to think of that title what house will you build me and I'm I'm I'm reading it this morning because I a family from Tucson is out of town he says spiritual speaking over the city I don't know of any place that's any more spiritually dead or spiritual dead than in the City of Tucson and all the Phoenicians said amen that's right you can call yourself Jerusalem all you want to he say spiritually speaking I don't know of any place that's more spiritual dead than in the City of Tucson now what I'm about to read brother Bram says essentially the same things about Phoenix so we're just going to lump ourselves into here but I want us to think about the climate we live in spiritually speaking spiritually dead there's war between the churches there's fusses between the congregations Spirits don't die there's no Unity everyone grabbing and holding and squeezing trying to get this one and prelighting it is a desert spiritually speaking also this is the this is Brother diagnosis he says the same things about Maricopa County says the same things about Phoenix and Arizona it was a spirit that's on this area and it's existed for over 70 years 80 years you can go back to the 40s brother Brown was calling out a nature that still permeates and exist to today that's what we live inside of that's what we live around now this is I want this to become very real to us you know what I'm talking about let's not play dumb let's not play ignorant it exists it's the atmospheres that exist it's the attitudes that exist it's what tries to get on us and make us competitive tries to get on us and make us judgy and draw circles it's a spirit that we've got to defend against the spirit of the phoenix the spir Spirit of Arizona the spirit of Tucson we got to defend against the spirit of the desert the grabbing the holding the squeezing the prelighting I want you just allow your your thoughts to wonder for five seconds think about the condition of the world that we live in five four three two is it distracting if I'm counting think of it what we're living in think of all I want you to get inside your mind mind it's just it's it's aggravating right it's teeth clenching everything just grates eats at you and the world is just trying to find ways to trigger you right just just find just the right circumstance where it seems like everything's fine all a it's like no matter what it is that's what we it's an aggravated climate it's an agitated atmosphere it's a frenzy there's friction that it's tumultuous trying to get us on edge right it's neurotic it's tension high stress and everything and we don't even necessarily realize it things are building pressure is building it's what we live in and in the sermon everpresent water from the Rock brother Brown's talking about the desert and the spiritual condition of being a dry place and the cactus and the prickly and it gets really really dry and when it gets dry the grass dies and when you walk on the grass there's stickers and there's briers and you try to go on a a walk or a hike to enjoy it and there's rattlesnakes and there's jumping cactus and there's rocks and there's all sorts of things and there's just like a whole herd of dogs that have been there before you and if there's if it's not bagged it's just it's if it's bagged it's left it's a nightmare got doggy diapers everywhere and and and then you think it's everywhere it's a dry place it's an aggravating place it's a it's a place of tension spiritually speaking it's dead he says and brother BR says but that's where them who live in that place have to suffer with the conditions of that place you kind of wait till the weather gets like this before you read statements like this but those who live in that place have to suffer with the conditions of that place talk about the dry place the the cactus the pricklies and those who desire to live in that kind of an atmosphere not talking about the desert now but notice spiritually speaking those who desire live in that kind of an atmosphere where everything's just punching and fussing and quarreling and stewing like that well you'll just live under that atmosphere that's all but we don't have to live there hope you catch what I'm saying but we don't have to live there it's not necessary for us to stay there there are certain that we if we say well this is where I live this is where my job is this is where my family is this is I don't know where else to go I don't know what else to do and and this is where I was born and raised or this is where I I built a home whatever the reasons we find ourselves in Phoenix or Arizona I mean God forbid that you would just uproot and move all the way from Back East uh to Phoenix for no other reason than to start a church but for whatever reason you're here but you're here said well it's hot and the economy is bad and this is happening that's happening and it's fussing it's stewing it's a spiritual desert there's punching there's fussing there's quing Ste he says those who desire to live in that can but you don't have to you don't have to you might be thinking oh well yes there's a door for me to move but he saying it's not necessary for us to stay there and I want you to think about this because what we could say at the very least is well oh when we all get to heaven but that's not what he's saying he's not saying oh we don't have to live there when we all get to heaven no more fussing no more stewing no more quarreling no more fighting that's not what he's saying we don't have to live there though we live in a place that's spiritually speaking dead though we live in a desert though we live in a time of aggravation and agitation if you want to live there live there but if you don't want to live there you don't have to live there as we read in Acts chap 17: 28 and 29 brother brandom already touched on this he says for now the Bible says for in him in God we live we have life and move we have activity and have our existence that's our reality in him we live move and have our being in him not in Le DEA not in the world not in man-made politics not in sin not in the contaminated atmospheres it's in him and then he draw us from their own uh theology certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring Paul then doesn't dispute that he affirms it first as much then as we are The Offspring of God now if God has an offspring it has to be deity we ought not to think that the godhead is liken to gold or silver or stone Graven by Art and man's devices the godhead godlikeness the headship of God the hood of God the kingdom of God we ought not to think of it as in the terms of gold or silver or stone Graven by Art in man's devices we can't think of the Kingdom in terms of the materials that man works with our weapons are not carnal right so in our spiritual warfare we have Supernatural weapons so he's saying if in him we live and move and have our being then we ought not to think of the Kingdom in terms of gold and silver and stone and things that are fashioned by man we can't look at the building we can't look externally we can't look at somebody who drives a nice car or somebody who builds a nice house or somebody has the finery in life and say oh they must be blessed of God and look at somebody who's destitute say oh God must hate them that's not the kingdom the kingdom is the Holy Ghost in you it's the word in action in you that's something that is measured by different tangibles that the world doesn't measure by in him we live and move and have our being so we ought not to think about the kingdom of God in terms of gold and silver and stone that art and man's imagination and creativity fashion but we ought to think of it in terms of Supernatural things and if if we are his offspring now brother bradam says this and this is I know this is again another step you might think man you really covered a lot of ground today says we are in an amateur way creators he says if we have zoic God's life in us we become sons of God and amateur creators now in saying amateurs we could say maybe we're not paid to do it or uh we we're not professional yet and um but there's he's trying to he's trying to distinguish in us being all God and being Godlike of being The Offspring and the one the the progenitor the one the the initial Creator so we are amateur creators because the Creator himself has brought us forth and birthed us of his own life therefore we have his nature we have his qualities and we as Sons then are little right little creators not the Creator and he uses the terminology to use express says and do you now believe each man that's born again with the spirit of God in him is a miniature creator that might shake you a little bit but that's the truth we are in the image of God God is a Creator if a man's born of the spirit of God he's an offspring of God and that part of God is in him and he believes every word that God says will materialize so that makes him part of God the holy spirit in the man makes him a part of God now have you you following my breadcrumbs and my steps today that if God is inside of you you are a creator that the power of God inside of you has given you power to create and though we live in a world that's chaotic God's given you power to create though you live in a world that's contaminated by sin God's given you power to create though you're surrounded by unbelief God's given you the power to create though you're surrounded by unbeliever God's given you the power to create though you're surrounded by Darkness God's giv you the power to create though you're surrounded by instability God's giving you the power to create though you're surrounded by Darkness God's giv you the power to create Bill said each one of you is a Creator did you know that each one of the people that's born again is a Creator he says we must create an atmosphere amen now I know this opens up a whole new room to explore he says we must create an atmosphere he says Us in so many different places that we could just spend volumes of time on it but remember in future home when God's going to bring forth the perfect Kingdom in the eth day brother BR said it's the atmospheres that are changed he's changing the atmospheres brother says and the things you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere so now begin to take some responsibility for what's around you amen you're a Creator yes the world's contaminated with sin and unbelief and fussing and stewing and quarreling and arguing it's all there it's going to find its way on your doorstep but your Creator and bass is the things you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about create an atmosphere so there's a possibility that you're agitated so you talk about agitated things you're aggravated so you talk about aggravating things and all the atmospheres that we live in are the things that we think on the things that we do and the actions and the things we talk about are now becoming the power of our of our words the power of activity the powers of our thinking and not only is it in the world but now it's in our doorstep and it's in our atmosphere and we're not living in a world of perfect faith and we're not a Mystic because the world says I'm angry just like you I'm pulling my hair out just like you in the same spot that's right I feel just like you do I with I get somebody hey yeah we know what's up in this time time it's a it's a stressful time and and we are the world is identifying with our frustrations with our aggravations with our blowups and our tensions he's saying the things we think about the things we do things we talk about create an atmosphere you are a Creator in the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel is where he says that then he says this in Divine love and I'm I'm just I I got to wrap this up so I just want to put these things out there for us to hold on to and meditate on he says what type of atmosphere should we live in in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in that's it go ahead write it down I'll give you a chance five four Consulting soothing healing atmosphere this is the atmosphere we should live in it's consoling it's soothing it's healing doesn't that sound good a consoling soothing that's a nice word soothing just even the phonics of it are good the consoling sothing healing atmosphere that's that's where we should live with our hearts constantly in prayer with the deep love for every person we come in contact with amen talk about a revelation talk about supernatural you want to believe in miracles boom this is what he's saying we ought to live in Consulting soothing healing atmosphere that's the atmosphere you ought to live in now I just want to pose this whose responsibility is it to create it just want to ask you if that's the atmosphere we should live in God's a Creator God can do it if that's the atmosphere we live in and God has made you a Creator God has made you a miniature Creator amateur Creator God has put his own power inside of you you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost and this is the atmosphere we must live in and what we think on what we do what we acted on and what we say creates an atmosphere whose responsibility is it oh Hallelujah when brother Brandon preaches the revelation of Jesus Christ he preaches Revelation 4 part 2 he says about the creation the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light notice what God does God separated them the land and the water which made the Earth but the whole earth was covered over now what he did he just threw the atmospheres he just atmospheres is filled with hydrogen and oxygen and so forth then he just lifted it up off the Earth and separated it Hallelujah now go back to the creation where God looked at the Earth in its chaotic form how did God bring forth these great things we know is the earth he separated atmospheres he lifted up off the Earth and separated it in all its conglomeration and all its darkness and all it's chaos and confusion the Creator the one with the wisdom the one with the Revelation with faith in his own word created and separated atmospheres separated light from Darkness oh Hallelujah think about the plan of red Redemption that God does to the earth and the Plan of Redemption that God does for us in the Millennium in the Eighth Day what God does for the Earth in Millennium what God does for the E the Earth in the eighth day this is what God wants to do for us now oh could it be that God is wanting an atmosphere to be changed for us now that this part of the earth can create the world I live in Amen in that Millennium the lion will lay down with a lamb and the Millennium nature will be set into order think of all those descriptions we read in the scripture just briefly in the last several Services about what that Millennium is going to be like before the final change right showing us that even before this body is changed there's benefits and attributes of the Kingdom Life and Kingdom order that we can participate in why because the god of that kingdom is here am he's living inside of man amen in the Millennium the lion will get along with man and the lamb brother bramman the sermon love says did not the lions come after Daniel and could not touch him the atmosphere was changed amen could the fire burn Shadrach mesach and Abednego the atmosphere was changed and the god of Daniel still lives tonight he's the same God and I ask you where is he right where's the same God that stop the mouths of the ls how did he stop the mouth of the ls he changed the atmosphere he didn't necessarily have to change the nature of the lion he just had to change the atmosphere you can't change the nature of everybody you may not be able to change certain things out there in the world today you can't turn Le to see it upside down but you can turn your world upside down you can change the atmosphere I know it might seem to be a large task but it's the truth we can build our own world and live in it amen we can live in an atmosphere of perfect faith we can live in an atmosphere that's soothing healing consoling now it would be wonderful to know better that we can do that so that we can have the confidence to believe that whenever I'm not there perhaps I've created the wrong atmosphere and I can just get back into the right one that I I I'm not GNA relinquish My Liberty to the devil to the world to sin to the flesh I'm going to say that as a Son of God there's power in me over all of it amen and if I find myself in the flesh if I find myself being tempted if I find myself in the wrong atmosphere then I just got to get out of it because I'm building a kingdom I want to use this example as I close it maybe I have the entirety of the statements before me and I I hope it's okay to do this but I want to read you an example I I think probably some of you are already in your minds thinking of these very things we reading so much from these sermons on love brother BR says that the atmosphere was changed with Daniel and the Lion's Den when those Hebrew children went into the fiery furnace he said the atmosphere was changed he says the same he's the same God today what he didn't do is take Hanah Azariah mishel and take him away from the fire that's right he changed the atmosphere in the fire he didn't even Vanquish the Flames he changed the atmosphere so the atmosphere around him maybe this is what the scientists would say well there just was enough they were just they had they were sweating they were so nervous and when they walked into this furnace just that little bit of evaporation of their sweat they were sweating profusely at this point it just kept the fire off of them so it's scientifically possible you know and there and I can't remember what that reaction is called to where people can handle very hot things and just that thin layer of moisture even upon a person don't try this at home can keep them from being blistered are burn and but it's the atmosphere that changed Daniel wasn't eaten by the Lions because the atmosphere changed that's the power of God inside of us brother Brown makes this statement in that same sermon love he said that's the way it is when a man becomes Born Again listen to this part there's something takes place within him that he's sick and tired of the world I think what happens is when we're born again we are and then we just learn to stop St it right we just learn to just gut it out kind of like what some of us do with the Summers right we just learn to deal with it now it's just the way and and maybe we shouldn't be learning to deal with it right I don't I don't think we should necessarily to become Vigilantes a and during the election season just pick up everybody's Biden sign and create a bonfire but there's something about us to where we we get sick and tired of the world so there's a Godly Spirit around him I said this is what happens that we ought to have this and so now he brings it to a personal example that I think we can all relate to he says my life has been dealing with spiritual things as you understand the meeting you walk up people sometime that try to impersonate some brother brandom I sure got faith in you and you know he's lying so now he's he's able to get past the surface he says that's a spirit there that speaks a lot louder than his lips speak it's the atmosphere so so here's somebody who's saying the right thing but he has an aura about him he's created an atmosphere around him where brother B says no you're lying and if you'll learn love and to be kind to everybody be gentle and have patience he's talkinging about atmosphere it'll even make your home life different it'll make your associations different God will honor you he says now I've tried it and I think you know exactly where we're going with this but I want you to recognize this it'll make your home life different when you exercise the power of the Kingdom the power of Revelation the power of wisdom and understanding applying the token is wisdom and understanding and Revelation there's a lot here we can do he said here's some time ago in my home you can imagine what kind of turmoil it is all the time I he kind of builds the picture what's happening he said one day the house is all completely tore up and he said the basement had been full with people then about dark everything quieted down and he thought everybody was gone away and he goes into the kitchen and he said there stood my little wife 37 years old gray-headed holding her hands crying Billy I'm just going to lose my mind the children haven't had a bite to eat all day begins to describe the events of the day and this person needing prayer and this coming and that happening just how the day got away from she says I don't know what to do there sat Becky and Sarah on the floor fussing over some little blocks Sarah screaming at the top of her voice daddy Becky's got my blocks daddy she took my pocketbook a while ago Joseph sat on the floor beating on something as hard as he could the little boy screaming at the top of his voice anybody anybody say that sounds like home now you talk about home sweet home well I looked around I thought now there's just one thing to do we've got to change the situation so brother brandham grabbed his coat and went fishing he went to the The Greens Mill he went to the cave he first class ticket to Tucson and went on a hike in sabinaa Canyon he says we got to change this situation now those people there through the day so many through the night it does disturb the children so I said to My Heart Lord I want you to help me I'm just letting down to talk to you from the bottom of my heart tonight of some things that you don't have to tell everybody and this is what he's sharing to the church I'm I'm sharing some things with you that you don't have to tell everybody but I'm sharing this with you so I think this is very personal that he shares Lord you help me now to get upon me the holy spirit in such a way that it'll change the situation so begins to describe how that as he's praying put his arms around his wife oh sweetheart I really feel sorry for you Billy I don't believe I can hold that any longer I'm just going to go to Pieces Just look at this house yes that's right honey that's exactly right notice he doesn't say I can fix it right that's our Instinct and he said put her AR arm around her I know sweetheart and he's saying Lord quieten her now that's true he says but you know honey the other day I was in Louisville I saw one of those pretty little blouses one of those prettiest dresses and where was it she said but Billy no time to talk about blouses I kept my hand on her honey I tell you you've never seen such a pretty blouse well look I tell you what Let's do let's get supper right quick what we'll do is I'll take you and show it to you and I'll buy it for you oh that's nice of you Billy but oh I couldn't look at a blouse tonight oh just look at me but look honey if you'd ever see it I believe you'd want to buy it and he's saying his heart Lord quiet her holding her by the hand I told you put me on your apron I let me help you get supper put on the apron begin to chop some carrots and things you know going on after a while she began crying she began to quit crying I thought thank you Lord oh honey Isn't the Lord wonderful he's just so good kept talking to her changing that atmosphere he said he says now the only thing you have to change the situation if that can be done in a home it can be done in a church he says it can be done in a nation can be done in the whole world Amen it's the atmosphere that counts amen by whom by you if it can be done in your home it can be done everywhere else he talks about how in the atmosphere is how life comes forth under some kind of heat he said it's the atmosphere that counts he says and you make up that atmosphere with what you are inside of you that doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean it's just organic in the sense that you just kind of go I'm just going to radiate you know you come home kick the door down like what are you doing Aaron I'm changing the atmosphere by what's inside of me but no there's something inside of you with wisdom and Revelation and understanding you're saying God you need to give me wisdom in this situation reading the room and understanding things that take place and things that happen and so brother Bram says in another place he says try this at your home referring to the very same situation he says you tried this and if there ever was a home that's confused and torp as much as ours people from everywhere all over the world coming all the time day and night all hours brother Mike and musicians you could come he doesn't say that here I'm saying it now musicians come and I've noticed here some time ago my lovely little wife at 37 years old completely gray she stood between me and the public there's any Praises given to the Brandon family give it to her the telephone will one you wild day and night the house has been full all day I went out my little children little Sarah and Rebecca were fighting over some play blocks little Joseph and the baby sitting on the floor screaming to the top of his voice wife in the kitchen with her face bared in her hands weeping when I finally got the house emptied some in this room some in that room some in the basement I walked in I thought oh what a confusion she put her arms around Billy I'm going crazy I hav't been able to get the children any dinner sometime raging Maniac saying in reverent saying it reverently a bunch of some some Fanatics running back and forth through the house saying the Lord said this the Lord said I your manager the Lord said this just think of what he had to deal with now if the Lord wouldn't talk to me about that if he had something to say but you can't help it it's just in the human line his wife says children haven't had anything to eat I don't know what to do well I thought there's just one thing to do now I'm tired but I'm going to do this now heavenly father in my heart you help me to be what you would have me to be on this scene to me this is key you have me to be what you would have me to be on this scene here I am my husband I'm a father confusion chaos tension Madness and he has the wisdom and this is what he shares with us let's try this in our hes this is what he shares with us he says if you could do it in your home you can do it in a church do it in a nation could do it in the world your world and it starts by saying well Lord you make me to be what you would have me to be on this scene he hasn't even asked for the scene to change he just says you make me be what I'm supposed to be in the scene and that'll change what I'm seeing if you can change if you can make me what I'm supposed to be in the scene the scene will become what it ought to be I'll see the scene for what it is maybe I can use the scene For Your Glory maybe I'm seeing the scene wrong but if you can make me what I'm supposed to be in the scene I'll know how to approach it I'll know how to accept it I'll know how to address it I thought not if I could just get her quiet Sweetheart would you rush out to dinner with me oh I'd have to clean up the children you could hardly hear yourself think little Joseph just beating on the floor as hard as he could so I slipped over got on an apron put it around me and begin to help her honey you know what I saw the prettiest dress the other day just wanted to get it for you and it was in a certain city here close by we'll go get it and all the time of my heart praying Heavenly Father quiet this dear little woman we ought to live in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere is what he said we should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer with a deep love for every person we come in contact with why don't we start at home why don't we start at home having a deep love for everyone we come in contact with in the home you come in contact with him in the morning in the kitchen deep love right healing consoling this is what we ought to have he says I just put my arm around her her not knowing what I was doing sometimes I noticed the big distinction here he put his arm around her right he didn't Adam stand up for just for a second if you could he here you're probably tall enough to where you in the whole screen already but I'm taller than that don't no no no no let's make everybody think I'm 6'2 here he put his arm around it right but you know what sometimes our instinct is honey you need to calm down right we want to put hands on thank you for that right we want to lay hands on her right honey you're about to catch some hands if you don't chill out check yourself before you wreck yourself and he said no why don't you just put just put his arm around her and he says oh you know in it's heart oh quiet this woman her not knowing he says I was projecting creating a dis different atmosphere he was being what God wanted him to be in this scene I this may seem anti-climatic to you you might say oh man we built a whole Kingdom series up to this moment yes yes because this is where it matters listen if I can't find peace here what's it going to mean for me in the Millennium if I can't know his love here how am I going to know it in the Millennium this is where it counts this is really really pays off here this is what we were seeing in perfect love the payoff is here he says I was projecting created a different atmosphere and he says walk in the love of God had Fellowship in a few moments she got quiet and then when she got quiet Sarah and Becky divided up the play blocks Joseph got something to play with and there was peace in the home he said what was it projecting love now I'm going to read it to you the way that it's transcribed the way that it was originally transcribed I'm just going to read it this way if you want to go look it up but to me it strikes me when you listen to it and and you see what brother Bram was saying here he said Lord you make me what you want me to be you have me to be you help me to be what you would have me to be on this scene and knows how brother B describes this he says they were mine now notice what he's taking ownership of he said they were mine my children my wife they were mine that's my home you gave it to me it's not just a house it's not the structure the house is one thing the home is what we make of it that's my home that's my children that's my wife he says and I was God hallelujah think of what he's trying to say you help me to be what you would have me to be I am your hands on Earth I am your eyes on Earth I am your voice on Earth as you are a God in heaven I can be the god in the whole as you are the God and the invisible I can be the God made visible they were mine my children my wife my home I'm god with the power to change the atmosphere if God will change the atmospheres for the eth day if you'll Purge the world for the Millennium then can I create a world create an atmosphere that I can live in and God he says and and maybe some other transcription says and I was God's speaking of ownership but I think you could see it in any any of these lights how brother brah was becoming what he was supposed to be in that scene he says then God given his spirit and through that spirit with love to my family Sol and Grace come in and quied the family it'll do it I know it will amen we might might have to dig past our own human nature we might have to do it but I pray to God you start feeling that impulse amen that creative impulse that power to create a world and live on it I hope it begins to pulsate and beat so the next time that fussing and stewing and arguing and agitation and all the things that cloud the atmosphere start coming around and you're like oh you oh oh okay you want to fight let's do this right and whatever it might be that you start to get your Gander up a little bit you get triggered in whatever situation it is you begin to feel you feel that pulse of creativity rise up within you and say no no no no no no no no I'm going to create an atmosphere a and listen my advice would be to do what brother Bram did begin to pray quietly in your spirit Lord help me to be in this scene what you want me to be and not get religious Satan I rebuke you look at me when I'm talking to you woman Satan I rebuke you no it's atmosphere changing that's just going to make it worse it's atmosphere changing you don't even have to verbalize it but there's something emanating from you God given a spirit through that spirit with love for the family Sovereign Grace can come in and change the atmosphere the mouths of lions were stopped because the atmosphere changed the fire of the Furnace could not burn because the atmosphere changed listen Leo DEA is going to keep marching on but we can change the atmosphere we live in we can live in a bright age Kingdom we can live in the atmosphere of faith we can live in the atmosphere of deliverance we can live in the atmosphere of Supernatural expectation we can live in a world of perfect Faith because as Jesus Christ was able to it's what he was that's what we are and we can live in it I I I want you to go just be Kingdom Builders the right kind and live deliberately with purpose in your own homes starting there in your own individual lives to challenge yourself the next time an atmosphere is created even if you live by yourself the next time an atmosphere is being created sense that Kingdom Life inside of you that tells you and you say Lord help me to be what you would have me to be in this scene stand with me today
