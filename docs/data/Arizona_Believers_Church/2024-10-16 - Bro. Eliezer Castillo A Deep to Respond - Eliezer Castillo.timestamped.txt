[0:01] Psalms 42:7 and it's um when you begin
[0:04] to read it you'll understand that
[0:06] brother brandham talked about this a
[0:08] lot it's a very strange scripture but
[0:11] the way brother brandham brought it out
[0:14] that's something
[0:16] amazing he says the Deep calleth unto
[0:19] the Deep at the noise of thy water
[0:21] spouts all the way all thy waves and
[0:24] Billows are gone over me 1 John 3:2 it
[0:28] says belov loved now we are the sons of
[0:33] God and it do not yet appear what we
[0:36] shall be but we know that when he shall
[0:40] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[0:43] see him as he is now I just want us to
[0:47] emphasize now we are the sons of God we
[0:51] don't know what we're going to be we
[0:53] know that there's there's more but now
[0:56] we are the sons of
[0:58] God Heavenly Father father we ask for a
[1:01] just a special blessing father that your
[1:03] Holy Spirit may come down and just speak
[1:05] to us father allow us to just get closer
[1:08] to you a greater relationship a greater
[1:10] revelation of you father we ask that you
[1:13] bless each and every person every open
[1:15] heart father that you just give us the
[1:17] words of Life In The Name Of The Lord
[1:19] Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you
[1:21] may be
[1:23] seated now brother brandham he uses
[1:25] scripture in 427 and he said that if
[1:29] there's a a deep calling if there is a
[1:32] deep calling there is a deep to
[1:36] respond so the the Scripture it can go
[1:39] many ways if you you look at
[1:42] commentaries or if you listen to um
[1:44] theologians they'll go many ways of of
[1:47] Affliction and all of that but brother
[1:49] brandham he took this scripture and he
[1:51] said if there is a deep
[1:54] calling there is something
[1:57] else a deep two respon respond my my
[2:01] title today is a deep to
[2:03] respond and if we look throughout the
[2:06] seven Church ages and throughout the the
[2:09] ages of the Bible God has been calling
[2:12] out a people God has been calling out in
[2:15] every single age he'll call out a
[2:18] certain group and if you look at the
[2:20] Bible you'll see the world sometimes
[2:22] it's in total chaos but he'll call one
[2:25] person out of it and there's going to be
[2:27] one person that is going to
[2:30] respond now to the whole people to all
[2:33] of the world it looks like God is
[2:35] calling out the whole world for God so
[2:38] loved the whole world that he gave his
[2:41] only only begotten son that's truth we
[2:44] can take that to the bank we can take
[2:46] that and we could say God loves the
[2:48] whole
[2:49] world but whosoever
[2:52] believeth that is the Deep to respond
[2:56] that is a special elect people that are
[2:58] going to take that call every single age
[3:02] there was one person there was eight
[3:04] people there was five people there was
[3:06] two out of two million that would heed
[3:09] to that call that God would give and the
[3:12] people would step up out of millions of
[3:14] people and they say Lord here I
[3:17] am and a lot of times like whenever I'm
[3:20] reading the book of Jeremiah it it's a
[3:22] very sad book The Lamentations in the
[3:24] book of Jeremiah because you have this
[3:26] they call him the weeping prophet
[3:29] and Jeremiah he goes and he pleads with
[3:32] these people day after day after day
[3:36] deep calling to the deep deep calling it
[3:40] there was there was an eternal God
[3:42] talking to carnal people saying if you
[3:46] guys just repent everything will be all
[3:48] right if you guys just turn from the
[3:51] gods you guys are serving break down
[3:54] your Idols everything will be all right
[3:57] but if you don't judgment is coming
[4:00] judgment is coming and they would get so
[4:02] angry that they that his very own people
[4:06] would torture this poor man
[4:10] Jeremiah and and you look throughout the
[4:13] whole Bible or or throughout the whole
[4:15] scripture of Jeremiah and
[4:17] Lamentations nobody heeded to the call
[4:20] of
[4:21] Jeremiah now sometimes you look at that
[4:24] you'll look at the modern day and you
[4:25] say man that's an unsuccessful Pastor
[4:27] there that's an unsuccess ful Prophet
[4:31] there because nobody listened to him but
[4:35] in though that group and and and even
[4:38] though they had to go through that there
[4:40] was people that were elected in that
[4:43] group you had Ezekiel you had Daniel you
[4:47] had um um mesach Shadrach and
[4:50] abedo that had to go through that
[4:53] judgment and had to go through there and
[4:55] flourish to show that there was
[4:57] Christians out even though there was
[5:00] judgment and there was sin all over them
[5:02] yet there was an elect right there so
[5:05] even though it looks like man well God
[5:08] called and there's very few that answer
[5:10] this that's God's provided
[5:14] way that there there was elected people
[5:17] from the
[5:18] beginning before the beginning before
[5:21] there was any Earth we were already in
[5:24] him so even though it looks unsuccessful
[5:27] God says I got the people that I wanted
[5:30] the whole
[5:31] time that's amazing now when brother
[5:35] Brenham would speak about this deep
[5:37] color to the Deep he would always um
[5:39] give reference of a few stories one
[5:43] would be about the out when he was out
[5:45] in the wilderness he would talk about
[5:47] how he began to see Wilderness and he
[5:50] would see the elk and he would hear one
[5:53] calling out and then he would hear the
[5:55] other then he would begin to hear the
[5:58] wolves and then he would hear another
[5:59] calling out on the other side of the
[6:01] canyon on the other side of the
[6:04] Wilderness he would see the earth I mean
[6:07] the rainbow and he would say one part of
[6:09] the rainbow was calling out to the other
[6:12] and then he he gave reference to another
[6:15] story he says this in the message and he
[6:18] says this in many messages but here in
[6:20] um hearing recognizing acting on the
[6:22] word of God he says like the little boy
[6:24] that always that I always speak of
[6:27] eating erasers off pencils
[6:30] and the pedal off the bicycle he needed
[6:34] sulfur and as long as there was
[6:36] something there to Crave for sulfur
[6:39] there had to be sulfur somewhere first
[6:42] made there had to be a sulfur before he
[6:45] had a crave and it the sulfur projected
[6:49] him then he went back to the
[6:53] sulfur very simple very simple thing or
[6:57] or or example brother brandom gave but I
[7:00] begin to think about how when
[7:03] God he poured out judgment or or or he
[7:07] he casts out his judgment to Adam and
[7:09] Eve he told him in Genesis 3:19 he
[7:13] started to talk to Adam and he began to
[7:16] give the curses and he told Adam from
[7:19] dust you are and dust you shall return
[7:23] because we were born Out of the Dust We
[7:26] were born so our bodies are made of the
[7:31] ground it's made out of all those things
[7:34] so brother Bram he would always say
[7:36] we're made up of 16 elements and it's
[7:38] because in reality we're made up of six
[7:41] elements and then the rest I think um 11
[7:45] more consist around us and we need those
[7:49] so the first one is is oxygen carbon
[7:54] hydrogen nitrogen calcium phosphorus
[7:58] which uh constitute 90% of the body's
[8:02] Mass so we need those six elements in
[8:06] order to live in order for the life to
[8:08] function we need all of
[8:11] that and with the additional trace of
[8:13] elements like sulfur potassium sodium
[8:17] chlorine magnesium making up the
[8:20] remaining of the small percentage
[8:23] necessary for Life function so we need
[8:25] all of this for us to
[8:28] live and so you start thinking about
[8:30] this child he was born and he was made
[8:34] out of the Dust so he needed the Dust In
[8:38] order to live so the very thing that God
[8:42] cursed cuz he said cursed be the ground
[8:44] the very thing that he cursed that's
[8:46] what our bodies are
[8:48] craving the very thing that he said
[8:51] cursed be the ground now we're calling
[8:53] out for it so it's a deep calling to the
[8:56] Deep brother brandham he said the boy
[8:59] was calling out for sulfur and you know
[9:01] what it made that boy do he didn't know
[9:04] that he was craving
[9:05] sulfur brother BR said his body
[9:08] projected him to the sulfur so we saw a
[9:13] eraser maybe he's going to be a
[9:15] scientist I we don't know maybe he was
[9:17] going to be a astronaut we don't know
[9:20] but at that moment people said whoa this
[9:23] kid maybe he's not going to live up to a
[9:26] lot cuz he's chewing on a pedal he's
[9:29] he's acting
[9:30] strange maybe people are looking at him
[9:33] schoolmates seen seeing them eat see him
[9:36] eat their erasers and they saying he's
[9:38] acting
[9:40] weird the the pedal his parents are like
[9:43] something's wrong with this kid he's
[9:44] acting weird he's chewing on
[9:47] pedals but they didn't know that his
[9:50] body was projecting him back to the dust
[9:54] that there was a deep calling to the
[9:56] deep inside of him
[9:59] but on the outside he's acting
[10:02] weird on the outside he he's acting
[10:06] strange but there's something in him
[10:10] that that is calling out and and we have
[10:13] to think about it that that in our
[10:15] bodies that's we're consistent of that
[10:18] the top four atoms in us are the top
[10:22] four atoms that are in the
[10:26] universe so the top four atoms that we
[10:29] have it in the whole entire universe so
[10:32] the whole thing fell the whole thing is
[10:36] gone so i' I've heard scientists say
[10:39] that we are
[10:41] Stardust and that boy his body was
[10:44] calling out for
[10:46] sulfur brother brand he says in the
[10:48] things that are to be and I'm going to
[10:50] reference a lot the things that are to
[10:52] be
[10:53] because if you listen oh man what a
[10:56] beautiful message this basically
[10:59] a in depth look at the Deep callers to
[11:03] the Deep he didn't name it that but you
[11:06] look at it he's talking about what we
[11:09] were what we are and what this condition
[11:13] how it this condition is dictated by
[11:16] what we are and what we're going to
[11:18] be and he says this he says now this old
[11:22] world Must Fall why it's cursed it's in
[11:26] sin because it come through sex they
[11:29] come through disobedience in the
[11:31] beginning we was born here through sex
[11:34] through the fall it must go right back
[11:37] to the same way to the
[11:39] fall so no matter what we're born you
[11:43] know beautiful babies but we're all born
[11:46] through a curse and we all have to go
[11:48] back to that curse so even in our bodies
[11:52] a deep is calling to the
[11:55] Deep where where where brother bham he
[11:58] also says and the thinking man's filter
[12:00] he says my sheep hear my voice a
[12:02] stranger they will not follow for down
[12:04] in there is life and life connects with
[12:07] life amen and sin connects with
[12:12] sin sin is so hypocritical that it
[12:14] thinks that it is safe when it isn't but
[12:17] I like what he says sin connects with
[12:20] sin so we were born in sin we we have
[12:23] this this nature in us and we're calling
[12:26] out for it when we're born there's just
[12:29] something calling out because we were
[12:32] born of these things of these
[12:35] elements he has the right Satan has the
[12:39] right to Shadow over us he has the right
[12:42] to go and say I'm going to attach myself
[12:44] to him because he he did all of that he
[12:49] was able to deceive Eve he was able to
[12:53] allow Adam to sin so that he could say
[12:55] now I have the right to try to enter
[12:58] into this body to try to enter this body
[13:01] with sickness to try to make people um
[13:04] um depressed to try to make people go
[13:06] into sinful
[13:08] situations he has the
[13:11] right now um I I know I said this um on
[13:14] Wednesday but brother bam says this on
[13:16] question and answers he says and the
[13:19] life of a cabber has been taken out but
[13:22] the nature of the culber is still sticky
[13:25] see and we see it until and and it will
[13:29] be until this new life has fully
[13:31] developed out of the ground and raised
[13:33] up
[13:35] again so so it's not going to leave
[13:39] until our life is fully
[13:42] developed when it comes forth then there
[13:45] was no more cabber but wheat but wheat
[13:48] but while it's here on Earth the out of
[13:52] the earth and cabber it is still sticky
[13:56] because it's got the nature inside of of
[13:59] it
[14:00] wheat or or or it says but it's got
[14:03] nature the nature on the inside of it of
[14:07] Wheat and as long as you're in this life
[14:09] you're going to be sticky and have a
[14:11] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[14:14] as long as you live but inside of you
[14:18] you're born again and when you're raised
[14:21] up you're you're in likeness of Christ
[14:24] and all sin has gone from you and that's
[14:28] why we're talking about the other time
[14:30] that that's why this body cannot serve
[14:33] the
[14:34] Lord that's why we can't self self
[14:37] modify and try to say I'm going to be a
[14:39] Christian because in Corinthians 15:50
[14:41] it says now I say Brethren that flesh
[14:44] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[14:47] God why because sin is attached to sin
[14:52] dust has to go back to
[14:55] dust it's calling back to the dust it's
[14:58] calling us us that's why after a while
[15:01] whenever we grow up there's going to be
[15:03] a point even though we're eating all the
[15:05] dust we're eating the tomatoes we're
[15:07] eating all the good stuff it's just
[15:10] going to bring us back say hey come on
[15:12] you're coming back to the Grave with me
[15:15] you're going to
[15:17] decompose why because we are part of it
[15:21] and just like the sin that is attached
[15:23] to us through the serpent
[15:25] seed it's calling us sin is calling
[15:31] it's calling this
[15:32] flesh brother Bram he says in things
[15:35] that are to be he says now we find out
[15:38] this life holds all kinds of evils so
[15:42] therefore the life that is to come won't
[15:45] have it praise God Amen this life is
[15:48] going to have a lot of evils but the
[15:50] life that is to come won't have it this
[15:53] one has lust sickness death because what
[15:57] is it it's it's not the house that he's
[16:00] gone to
[16:01] prepare this is a pest house how many
[16:04] knows what a pest house is the
[16:06] congregation says amen sure well that's
[16:10] what we're living in a pest house is
[16:11] where they put all the disease people
[16:14] well that's just the um what sin has
[16:17] done to us put us in an Earthly pest
[16:20] house where you they wouldn't let anyone
[16:22] else come in um in the pest house
[16:25] because there's all kinds of germs
[16:27] flying around and the people will take
[16:30] these germs and be sick
[16:32] themselves because sin brought us into
[16:35] the devil's pest
[16:37] house this is UN making me understand
[16:40] that we're living miles under the
[16:44] condition God called us to
[16:47] be God has made us for a
[16:51] condition made us to be perfect made us
[16:55] to be an
[16:56] original but now we're in a deficient
[16:59] because the kid if you think about the
[17:01] child he was deficient of
[17:04] sulfur so he was deficient out of
[17:07] something so it caused them to act
[17:09] strange it caused them to be sick when
[17:12] somebody's anemic they're weak they
[17:15] can't move they lost all their strength
[17:17] in their blood why because they they've
[17:19] lost the iron that they need in their
[17:22] lives so what happens is is they put him
[17:26] in an anemic condition
[17:30] we are in a condition that is horrible
[17:34] brother Bram says we're living miles
[17:36] under the condition God made us to
[17:39] be brother Bram he says on the that day
[17:42] on Calvary he began to explain to his
[17:45] buddy because his buddy is like are we
[17:47] going to go squirrel hunting on the
[17:48] millennium are we going to do this and
[17:50] are we going to do that and and he had
[17:52] to explain that our mentality here is
[17:55] going to be completely different I
[17:57] remember when I was a kid I was like man
[17:58] am I going to be able to drink a Coke am
[18:01] I going to be able to do this and it's
[18:03] just such a carnal way of thinking we
[18:07] can't help it because that's all we know
[18:09] this is our perspective we're in the
[18:12] pest house so this is all we see but
[18:15] God's like oh just
[18:17] wait he says I said Charlie what if I
[18:21] can convince you that one time you was a
[18:23] hog and you had um raised to a higher
[18:27] being to a high being uh to a being a
[18:30] human
[18:31] being would you ever go back or would
[18:34] you ever go want to go back and enjoy
[18:37] the pleasures of a hog said no I said
[18:40] see you'd be so much higher than a hog
[18:44] you're human you never want to be a hog
[18:47] anymore I said now multiply that by
[18:51] 10,000 and that's what you'll be when
[18:53] you're changed from here to what you
[18:56] will be you'll never want to be human
[19:00] again so where is our condition we are
[19:04] deficient of
[19:06] something every true child of God has an
[19:09] eternal element in them that third
[19:12] defici on this boy was deficient of
[19:15] sulfur we're deficient of something out
[19:19] there so now we're in a horrible
[19:23] condition we're in an anemic
[19:26] condition and something bodies are
[19:29] calling out for dust but our souls are
[19:31] calling out for an eternal a seventh
[19:36] element and it's calling back to
[19:39] us it doesn't come from the earth it
[19:42] comes from
[19:43] God and we know many times brother
[19:47] Brenham says God had us in his
[19:50] thinking before there was anything we
[19:53] were there praising the Lord we were an
[19:55] attribute of God we are a peace of
[20:01] God so we were already had he he had us
[20:06] in his mind we were the forn knowledge
[20:09] thought of him and then we come here we
[20:12] go into this this condition where we're
[20:15] deficient from his
[20:17] spirit and then we begin to act
[20:21] weird we begin to act strange see
[20:23] everybody everybody's okay with their
[20:25] condition the world's going to be okay
[20:28] with sin
[20:30] we began to cry
[20:33] out that's why I'm sure everyone here
[20:37] has a testimony of thirsting for God
[20:41] whether you were raised in a church or
[20:43] you raised out of a church something
[20:45] began to call you out amen you could
[20:49] have been in the worst place and then I
[20:51] I remember just to give you a little
[20:53] testimony or little context to what I'm
[20:55] saying is I remember I was in a bad
[20:58] condition
[20:59] I'm not going to tell you my whole story
[21:01] but I was in a bad condition yet a song
[21:04] in church would go into my heart and it'
[21:07] start beginning to replay in my heart
[21:11] and I say why why is church music in my
[21:16] like why do I why am I singing church
[21:18] music when I want to be big bad Eli big
[21:20] bad
[21:22] elizer what was it it was a deep calling
[21:25] to a
[21:26] deep and then when you begin to stagger
[21:29] to church brother brandham said when
[21:31] somebody staggers to church and begins
[21:33] to give their heart to the Lord they
[21:35] begin to act strange then their
[21:36] co-workers begin to say man you
[21:40] changed what's wrong talking about God
[21:43] again were we smoking a week ago weren't
[21:47] we cussing w we talking about these
[21:50] things and now you're you're talking
[21:52] about God what is it they're crying out
[21:54] for something what are they doing
[21:56] they're chewing on the pedal and
[21:58] everybody thinks they're acting strange
[22:00] because now they want to pray before
[22:02] they eat their food in front of
[22:05] everybody now now now they want to open
[22:08] their Bible whenever they're in break at
[22:09] at
[22:11] work man this guy never did that what is
[22:13] he doing he's crazy they're eating
[22:17] they're chewing on that bicycle pedal a
[22:20] lot of times we don't know what we're
[22:22] calling out for a lot of times we're
[22:25] just we just want the surface level of
[22:27] who Jesus is oh he died on the cross not
[22:31] knowing the deepness and the
[22:34] profoundness of who God is that he has a
[22:38] word that will be revealed to you and it
[22:41] will begin to change you that there was
[22:44] a prophet here to reveal the word and it
[22:47] won't only bring us to a Justified or
[22:50] Sanctified or filled with the Holy Ghost
[22:52] condition but it will bring us all the
[22:53] way to a rapturing
[22:56] condition all the way to where you step
[22:58] into a new
[23:00] body whoa what is it it's you you begin
[23:04] to but you don't know that you need that
[23:07] sometimes the new Christian doesn't know
[23:09] they need that so they come to church
[23:12] and they say let me hear what the pastor
[23:13] has to say let me hear what the minister
[23:16] has to say Let me let me sing some songs
[23:18] when we come to church we're chewing on
[23:20] that
[23:23] pedal but God there is a Eternal God
[23:26] calling from a deep
[23:29] calling from the deep and there you are
[23:31] responding back to that
[23:33] deep and sometimes people are going to
[23:36] call you crazy but let
[23:38] them why are you wearing those that kind
[23:41] of clothes you're oldfashioned I don't
[23:44] care why why why are you acting that way
[23:48] now I don't care because whatever is
[23:52] calling you is a is a more of a reality
[23:55] than this
[23:57] place this Place brother bam says is the
[24:01] negative this place is just a
[24:04] shadow this place is is full of sin it's
[24:07] a pest house and I don't want nothing to
[24:09] do with it if I can I will allow the
[24:12] Lord to change me so that I could be a
[24:14] living EP
[24:15] pistol so that I can be an alien and
[24:18] show people hey there's another land out
[24:21] there hey there's another place you guys
[24:24] are looking for UFOs and aliens here I
[24:27] am I'm from another place I'm From
[24:29] Another Dimension I'm from another
[24:32] another thing called
[24:35] eternity outside of of everything that
[24:38] you think is real outside of the
[24:40] ambition of money outside of the
[24:42] ambition of all these things that the
[24:44] world is saying this is
[24:46] reality then here we come saying God is
[24:50] real God sent a prophet there is a word
[24:54] that will change you from the condition
[24:57] that you're in amen you look a little
[25:00] anemic you look a little deficient from
[25:03] God woo and then you see them begin to
[25:06] light have you ever seen somebody from
[25:08] from a sinful condition and then them
[25:10] giving their heart to the lord it's
[25:14] beautiful brother brandham he says when
[25:16] a woman is pregnant he says no matter
[25:18] how foul she is there's a spirit that
[25:21] allows her to
[25:23] Glow it glows because there's a spirit
[25:26] around her brother brenon says that
[25:28] that's how our new birth is that there's
[25:31] a spirit around us that there's a
[25:35] glow life is about to happen praise
[25:40] God he brother Bram says in thinking
[25:43] man's filter he says notice the word
[25:46] cannot deny
[25:47] itself then it is satisfied or it's the
[25:51] desire it's a desire of what what made
[25:55] you desire it in the first place because
[25:58] down in your soul there was a
[26:00] predestinated seed which was eternal
[26:03] life always laying in there always was
[26:07] in there all that the father has given
[26:09] me will come to me there isn't any of
[26:12] them that are going to be lost there's a
[26:15] beautiful quote I don't have it here but
[26:17] he says you weren't seed when you gave
[26:19] your heart to the Lord you didn't become
[26:22] seed when you were you were born again
[26:24] you always were
[26:25] seed you were always there now you are
[26:29] just calling back to
[26:31] Eternity deep calling to the
[26:34] deep I I was remembered remembering how
[26:37] brother Brandon painted a picture of the
[26:40] Samaritan woman at the well it's a
[26:43] beautiful picture how he how and he
[26:46] would explain how low down she
[26:49] was and you look at her body you look at
[26:53] her her face you would say oh this
[26:55] person there is no hope
[26:58] I don't know if anybody's ever said that
[27:00] about you I don't know if maybe some of
[27:02] us have said that about somebody else
[27:04] but that's who her condition
[27:07] was brother brandham he says there was
[27:09] this little in ill- famed
[27:12] prostitute her first life up there was
[27:15] black as could be so you look at her her
[27:19] life was full of sin could be from her
[27:22] life she was a
[27:24] prostitute but
[27:26] secondly down was just a little bit of
[27:31] light that's the seed brothers that's
[27:34] the
[27:35] seed he said because she had a
[27:38] conception of what the the Messiah would
[27:42] be now the the soul declares two things
[27:45] Faith or
[27:46] unbelief now you have these Pharisees
[27:48] that were brother bham says they were
[27:51] white you look at their life you could
[27:53] not put one thing on their
[27:55] life you couldn't put one finger on
[27:58] their life and say oh they did that they
[27:59] were
[28:00] perfect so their first everything you
[28:03] would see was light but just as God went
[28:08] down to her and he saw a little bit of
[28:10] light he went down to the Pharisees and
[28:13] he saw
[28:15] Blackness he saw
[28:19] Blackness he continues on in the voice
[28:21] of the sign he says that little woman
[28:23] with a pure heart and a defiled body and
[28:27] the Pharisees with a pure body and a
[28:30] defiled heart it condemned one and it
[28:34] saves the other what was the difference
[28:36] when God when God manifested himself
[28:40] through Jesus Christ the word they said
[28:43] ah he's a devil we're not accepting that
[28:47] word brother brandham said why was there
[28:50] light in her because she had a
[28:53] conception of what the Messiah would
[28:56] be she was watching she was waiting she
[28:59] was she was
[29:02] deficient she was she had a culber
[29:05] nature she was full of sin in this pest
[29:07] house didn't know what to do she lived
[29:09] in sin until the word came and she said
[29:14] that's what I
[29:15] need that's what I'm deficient on that
[29:18] that's what this little light called my
[29:20] soul called the seed has been crying out
[29:23] for brother brandom says that God puts a
[29:26] thirst in every single person
[29:28] in the
[29:30] world that's amazing but then you'll see
[29:34] people that use that god-given thirst go
[29:36] out to the bars and start
[29:38] drinking start smoking start lusting
[29:41] start doing all those
[29:43] things but that's what what's causing it
[29:48] it's a god-given
[29:49] thirst all of those vile things all of
[29:53] those evil things are being caused
[29:56] because there is a God get they're
[29:58] looking for something to satisfy them
[30:02] they're eating bicycle pedals they're
[30:04] figuring out what to do they need
[30:06] something to satisfy them but it'll
[30:08] never help because they're looking at
[30:10] the wrong place until one day they'll
[30:14] stagger in and they'll heal the hear the
[30:17] word of God and something will change
[30:19] and then say that's what I was deficient
[30:22] on that's what was calling me he says he
[30:26] stood between them here in the when
[30:29] their eyes were open and they knew him
[30:30] he said he stood between them when he
[30:33] did the Messiah
[30:34] sign showed them who he was and
[30:37] everything it blackened the whole thing
[30:40] of those
[30:41] Pharisees they went back to Blackness
[30:45] because why cuz they had nothing down
[30:49] here to anchor
[30:51] on they called him be alub a devil and
[30:55] the light they did have went out and
[30:58] they perished in it here is this woman
[31:01] black and sin as she could be but in her
[31:05] heart she knew that the Messiah would be
[31:09] she know what sign he would show and as
[31:12] soon as he said to her dot dot dot what
[31:15] did he say I'm he she says well I know
[31:19] she had a conception well I know when
[31:22] they say they told me this and and
[31:25] whenever I was able to get close enough
[31:27] to hear them they said this and they
[31:29] said this and they said this and finally
[31:31] they said one would come and do all
[31:34] these things he says I'm he that's all
[31:38] she needed she changed from a defiled
[31:42] person and she got the vitamins she got
[31:45] the word she got the eternal life that
[31:47] she needed and she stepped into the life
[31:50] that God has called us to be
[31:52] in amazing and a lot of times what is
[31:56] that you have to go deep in enough with
[31:58] the Lord amen you you you have to go and
[32:01] you have to talk to him until you see
[32:03] him amen you don't see just a prophet
[32:07] you don't just see see first of all I
[32:09] remember hearing a tremendous Minister
[32:11] say how she went to him and first she
[32:13] saw a
[32:15] man what how did she confront him well
[32:18] you being a Jew and I'm a Samaritan we
[32:20] shouldn't have no dealings together that
[32:23] was her first
[32:24] revelation that was her first revelation
[32:26] getting in contact with the
[32:28] word then he be to talk she
[32:32] said I think you're a prophet what was
[32:35] it a greater
[32:37] Revelation and you know what praise God
[32:39] for that
[32:40] Revelation people say wow that man
[32:44] William brandom what a prophet but
[32:46] brothers that's as far as they
[32:48] go man you're a prophet amen and you
[32:52] know what that's a great great
[32:54] Revelation because if you hear other
[32:56] people talk about brother Brown they
[32:57] don't don't have nice things to say so
[33:00] if you hear a person that's in another
[33:02] denomination or some other great Network
[33:05] or whatever they're in they'll say oh
[33:07] he's a prophet we say wow but that's as
[33:10] far as they go man he did wonderful
[33:13] things but when he began to talk about
[33:15] certain things that's when I
[33:18] stopped that's as far as they went but
[33:22] she stayed amen she kept listening to
[33:25] the word she kept asking what did when
[33:29] when Phillip when Philip told
[33:33] Nathaniel he said come and see there's a
[33:36] man where's he from
[33:38] Nazareth uh has anything good come from
[33:41] Nazareth that's his first revelation he
[33:43] said what come and see if you got any
[33:46] doubts if there's something that you
[33:48] need come get a deeper look get a deeper
[33:52] look in Christ amen and she began to ask
[33:56] him and ask him for first he was a man
[33:58] that she all she could see was
[34:00] race then she saw a prophet then as she
[34:04] continued to talk he said I am he and
[34:06] she saw the manifested word in front of
[34:09] her and she said haven't this guy said
[34:12] everything about my life all he said was
[34:14] about her adulterous
[34:16] life but when he she said it she said he
[34:20] knows everything about
[34:22] me this is him this is God this is the
[34:26] word same thing with with Peter who do
[34:28] men say well some say you're this some
[34:30] say you're that who do you say that I am
[34:33] you're the
[34:35] Christ that's when we get we begin to
[34:38] get vitamins we start begin to walk and
[34:41] step into the very body we're going to
[34:44] be changed into the very word that's
[34:47] going to change our bodies we're
[34:48] stepping into
[34:51] yes
[34:54] amazing brother bradam he says
[34:58] in in God who is rich in Mercy he says
[35:00] for when God had you in his thinking at
[35:03] the beginning you have to be some part
[35:05] of your life that is in you now had to
[35:08] be with God before
[35:10] there
[35:12] well he before he can come become
[35:16] material here on Earth before there was
[35:18] anything but God you were one of his
[35:20] attributes he knowed what your name
[35:22] would be he know the color of your hair
[35:25] you would have he know all about
[35:28] you he know everything about us what is
[35:32] it the Deep calling to the Deep God
[35:35] calling from
[35:37] eternity and every time we
[35:40] answer Heaven and Earth get
[35:43] closer what does it say whenever a a a
[35:47] person in sin converts or
[35:51] repents it says just like whenever a man
[35:54] he he lost his n or his H hundredth
[35:56] sheep he leaves the a 99 and he goes and
[35:59] he gets that one and when he gets them
[36:01] there's a
[36:02] party and he says that's the same thing
[36:04] when God recovers a
[36:06] sinner what Heavens begin to rejoice
[36:10] when you gave your heart to the Lord
[36:12] whether it was in your couch whether it
[36:15] was in church wherever it might have
[36:18] been it could have been a quiet place
[36:21] insignificant nobody cares nobody knows
[36:25] yet there was a party in heaven
[36:27] when you accepted him all of Heaven
[36:31] reacted and said they're finally in
[36:34] she's finally heard the call he finally
[36:37] heard the
[36:39] call and Heaven and Earth gets a little
[36:42] bit of
[36:42] closer brother bam says when you receive
[36:47] when
[36:48] um he says when this body receives the
[36:51] spirit of God when you receive the Holy
[36:53] Spirit The Immortal Life inside you it
[36:57] throws the body into subjection to God
[37:00] hallelujah that's he he that's born of
[37:03] God do not commit sin he cannot
[37:06] sin and and and brother bradam he began
[37:10] to talk about here in in the Great
[37:13] Commission he starts talking about the
[37:16] the rainbow and the elk and the the wolf
[37:19] and he says you know David says when the
[37:23] Deep call it to the deep deep began
[37:27] calling to the deep I heard an old bull
[37:30] ALK bugle he says the storm separated
[37:35] them so there was something that
[37:38] separated us from us and our
[37:40] creator something separated us he said
[37:44] through the mass of blowing the timber
[37:45] falling the herd had broke had got broke
[37:49] up they were bugling to one another to
[37:53] what to come back together amen the mate
[37:57] of the wolf was calling let's come back
[38:00] together the eye was calling to the
[38:04] rainbow let's come back to together the
[38:08] spirit calling to the church let's come
[38:11] back together let's unite God was there
[38:15] praise God you know what's the amazing
[38:18] thing about this
[38:19] story that there was a bugling out there
[38:22] and a bugling there could have been
[38:25] miles the the howling could have been
[38:29] miles but as The Bull Al begin to cry
[38:32] out have you heard a bu a bugle from a
[38:35] bull Al beautiful thing I remember my
[38:38] kids heard it they're like who's
[38:41] screaming it's just a very intense
[38:44] sound he began to cry out what does the
[38:48] mate do she doesn't sit there and like
[38:51] oh there he is let me call back now she
[38:54] says I heard it this way let me go go
[38:57] through here let me go up through this
[39:00] Valley let me go through here then she
[39:03] would hear it
[39:04] again and then she would hear him and
[39:07] what was it they were getting
[39:09] closer they were getting closer then she
[39:12] would hear the word again and she say
[39:15] I'm going to turn here I'm going to go
[39:17] down through here I have to go up this
[39:19] mountain and whenever she would hear it
[39:21] again she got closer and closer and
[39:25] closer until what the two deeps finally
[39:29] met one day as we hear that call we're
[39:33] looking we're hearing we're becoming
[39:36] we're getting closer and closer to God
[39:38] until one day the two deeps will
[39:41] meet today we are Sons and Daughters of
[39:44] God but one day we will be like
[39:47] him the Bible says yesen we are not like
[39:51] him yet
[39:54] completely but one day we shall see him
[39:57] as he is and we will be just like
[40:00] him we are listening to the call of our
[40:03] of our mate we are listening to the call
[40:05] of the spirit and as we do that we're
[40:08] getting closer and what is that call
[40:10] let's come back together amen you were
[40:13] never you were never meant to be in this
[40:15] pest house you were never meant to be
[40:18] sick and in this
[40:20] condition but I'm going to call you but
[40:23] I'm going to call and I'm going to call
[40:25] and I'm going to call and as we listen
[40:27] to that call we are being
[40:29] transformed into that word we are being
[40:32] made into that
[40:35] image that's
[40:37] beautiful I'm going to reread this this
[40:40] quote he says like that little boy that
[40:42] I always speak of eating erasers and
[40:44] pencils and the pedal off the bicycle he
[40:46] needed sulfur and as long as there was
[40:49] something to Crave for sulfur there had
[40:51] to be sulfur somewhere first made there
[40:55] had to be sulfur before he had the
[40:58] Crave and it the sulfur projected him he
[41:03] went back to the
[41:04] sulfur brothers sisters it's going to
[41:07] project
[41:08] you you don't know why you act a certain
[41:11] way it's going to project your
[41:14] body why am I like this because there's
[41:16] a call there's a deep calling to the
[41:21] Deep brother brandham he says in things
[41:23] that are to
[41:25] be he says how much more abler is he to
[41:29] get he's a
[41:31] Creator now how able is he to prepare us
[41:35] a body to live like his own glorious
[41:38] body if we want to live there's
[41:41] something in US calls to live and
[41:45] there's something in us that calls to do
[41:48] right then God will call somebody on the
[41:51] platform or in the Pulpit that will
[41:53] preach the absolute truth why see it
[41:56] show knows you then if you're a real
[41:59] child of God you begin to cry out God
[42:03] take it away from me circumcise me from
[42:06] this take these things away from me why
[42:09] it's needed for your heavenly home that
[42:11] you're going
[42:12] to whereas he's gone to prepare you got
[42:16] to be a real word bride of
[42:19] Christ see what we think just coming to
[42:22] church is just to come to church eating
[42:24] that bicycle pedal but he says it's
[42:26] needed for your Heavenly
[42:28] Home the reason why we come out and we
[42:31] cry and we say Lord take these things
[42:33] away from me Lord allow me to get closer
[42:36] hearing our our pastor preach these
[42:38] messages to allow us to get better and
[42:41] greater Christians what is it it's
[42:43] needed for our Heavenly
[42:46] Home a deep calling making you do
[42:49] strange things and you're
[42:52] responding just like that that the slave
[42:55] that they said man he acts different yes
[42:59] what was making him act different
[43:01] everybody was was sad and oppressed why
[43:04] they were in a horrible
[43:06] condition but then you see this man and
[43:08] he's working like like he's getting paid
[43:11] to do
[43:12] it and the guy said I want I want that
[43:15] slave and he said no he's not for sale
[43:18] what is he is he the boss is do you feed
[43:21] him better he says no he was a
[43:25] prince what caused him to act different
[43:28] his past condition what caused him to
[43:31] act different because he knew who he
[43:33] came
[43:34] from why do we act
[43:37] different not only our
[43:40] past not only for
[43:42] knowledge but election and
[43:46] predestination because we know where we
[43:48] came from it makes us act like the way
[43:52] we act because we know where we came
[43:55] from and we know where we're going amen
[43:58] we know wherever we came from we're
[44:00] going
[44:02] back in Romans 8:30 as I'm beginning to
[44:06] close he says moreover did he
[44:08] predestinate them he also called and
[44:12] whom he called them he also Justified
[44:14] and whom he justified them he also
[44:18] glorified praise
[44:20] God predestinate it pre means
[44:25] before this is a strange word pre means
[44:28] before destined
[44:30] means an end an an expected
[44:34] end so what God did in the beginning he
[44:38] already wrote your End Amen in the
[44:41] beginning he already knew everything
[44:43] about
[44:44] you no wonder Jesus can say I am the
[44:47] Alpha and the Omega I'm the beginning
[44:49] and the
[44:50] end so even when you're
[44:53] Justified even when you're a green tree
[44:56] you are already perfect in God's
[44:59] eyes God already has an expected end for
[45:03] you God already has a place prepared he
[45:06] already has your steps ready for you to
[45:09] walk before you even even before we give
[45:13] our hearts to the Lord he's already got
[45:15] an expected end he's already got
[45:18] something for us if you like to stand
[45:22] with me and the musician it would come
[45:24] up brother brandom Walked In Christ is
[45:28] the mystery of God revealed how when God
[45:30] rose from the dead or Jesus rose from
[45:32] the dead his spirit and his body was
[45:35] separated but as his Spirit begin to
[45:38] ascend his body be to react to the
[45:41] Ascension of his spirit and his body and
[45:45] his Spirit began to come together until
[45:49] it became one and it was a glorified
[45:51] body brother Bram says that the body the
[45:55] church was lay
[45:58] there and as the word began to cry out
[46:01] throughout the seven Church ages the
[46:03] body through the word begin to raise up
[46:06] amen and he says one day that body and
[46:10] the head will unite together one one
[46:13] more
[46:14] time it will
[46:16] unite and he says the more the word was
[46:19] revealed the body begin to be alive I
[46:23] love how brother brother Aaron's been
[46:25] bringing out about Pentecost and the the
[46:27] Methodist how they
[46:29] stopped see when justification came that
[46:33] was the allotted word for their
[46:36] day so when God gave it to them they
[46:39] could only go to a Justified state that
[46:42] was their
[46:43] Revelation no
[46:45] higher they could not go any higher why
[46:48] that was their
[46:49] portion and that was the body going up a
[46:53] little then sanctification a great
[46:55] Revelation came and the body of Christ
[46:58] went up a little higher and they said
[47:01] praise God they rose up to another
[47:04] Heights another levels Pentecost came
[47:07] and the gifts of the spirits came but
[47:10] that's as far as they could
[47:12] go but a as as it goes finally The Head
[47:16] and the body have to meet that's this
[47:19] message
[47:21] today because there is no other message
[47:23] out there there's nothing else to raise
[47:26] us up this word that we have today is
[47:29] going to change your mortal body amen
[47:32] amen it's going to bring you to your
[47:35] mate so so we're not expecting another
[47:39] age we're not expecting uh some other
[47:42] thing we're expecting for the two Elks
[47:45] to
[47:46] meet the two wolves to meet the bride
[47:49] and her husband am and it's happening
[47:52] right now do you believe thaten that
[47:56] it's no more negative it's no more

[48:01] now and some they're just a little
[48:04] behind some are still coming some are
[48:07] still giving their heart to the Lord
