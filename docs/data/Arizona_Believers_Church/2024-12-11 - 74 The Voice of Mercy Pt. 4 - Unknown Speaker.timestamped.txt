[0:00] but uh if you could on this Wednesday
[0:01] night this midweek I know it may be
[0:03] difficult just focus some and I'd like
[0:05] to move quickly because I have a lot
[0:07] that's on my heart just not sure how
[0:08] much we could cover uh but I just feel
[0:11] uh pressed just to share some things
[0:12] tonight uh to you all that are here um
[0:15] and I know if you can catch it it'll be
[0:17] a blessing to you uh this is part four
[0:20] on the voice of mercy and I'd like to
[0:22] say this way that the the voice of Mercy
[0:25] or the voice of the mercy seat is in the
[0:26] bride today the bride under her
[0:28] messenger is the f voice to the final
[0:31] age that is if there's going to be
[0:33] anything spoken uh if in this last age
[0:36] if there's going to be anything lived
[0:37] out or declared it's going to be through
[0:39] his body because we are his body and his
[0:41] voice in Romans chapter 9: 23 just going
[0:45] to take some overlap from Sunday says
[0:48] and that he might make known The Riches
[0:50] of his glory on the vessels of Mercy
[0:52] which he had a four prepared unto Glory
[0:55] that is you those who have obtained
[0:57] mercy and have received Mercy you are
[0:59] vessel of Mercy you're not vessels of
[1:02] Wrath wherein the wrath of God is poured
[1:03] out upon those who reject him and they
[1:06] receive wrath and they become subject to
[1:08] it and receive that punishment of it we
[1:11] are on the contrary vessels of Mercy
[1:14] which God has prepared unto Glory a
[1:17] vessel of Mercy is a chosen instrument
[1:19] one that is going to be an instrument of
[1:21] Mercy or one who is an assistant in
[1:23] accomplishing mercy so I want you to
[1:25] think of it not just in terms of Mercy
[1:28] given and mercy received but that now
[1:30] you hold Mercy you are a vessel of Mercy
[1:33] therefore you are a container has
[1:35] anybody ever called you a container
[1:36] before you're a container you hold mercy
[1:40] and holding Mercy now you have something
[1:42] that you can give something that can be
[1:44] granted brother Bon makes this statement
[1:47] in the Statue of a perfect man he says
[1:49] the church is now supposed to be taking
[1:51] the place of Christ carrying on his
[1:54] ministry that's quite a statement we are
[1:57] to be taking the place of Christ Paul
[1:59] said in Christ stead I I'm saying be
[2:02] reconciled to God so the church is to be
[2:04] taking the place of Christ carrying on
[2:06] his ministry he that believeth on me the
[2:09] works that I do shall he do also now
[2:12] notice the scripture he's referencing in
[2:13] John 14 says yet a little while and the
[2:16] world seeth me no more yet ye shall see
[2:18] me for I will be with you even in you to
[2:21] the end of the world there it is
[2:23] carrying on his work so we know that the
[2:26] bride will finish uh in her Earthly
[2:29] Ministry the things that Christ did not
[2:30] finish in the days of his Earthly
[2:33] Ministry that we will finish the work
[2:35] that's what the bride is to do and is to
[2:37] accomplish and so we as he was an
[2:40] instrument of God's mercy and as he was
[2:43] uh declaring the father we have that
[2:45] calling today to carry on his ministry
[2:48] as he says carry on his work Romans
[2:51] 11:31 even so have these also now not
[2:55] believed so there's those that do not
[2:57] believe that through your mercy they
[2:59] also May obtain Mercy as vessels of
[3:02] Mercy that are continuing the work of
[3:04] Jesus Christ we must be merciful and in
[3:07] being merciful uh there's others that
[3:10] will likewise obtain Mercy through your
[3:14] mercy it's uh I guess there's uh I don't
[3:17] know why this comes in my mind but I'm
[3:19] sure we've all uh been pitched a pyramid
[3:21] scheme before and if you want to know
[3:24] what a Ponzi scheme what is a Ponzi
[3:25] scheme or what's a pyramid scheme is
[3:27] just ask yourself what happens if every
[3:29] everybody in the world participates what
[3:32] happens to the last guy right he has
[3:34] nobody to pitch it to he can't doesn't
[3:36] have a downline he's the end of the road
[3:38] and so the same thing with uh uh with if
[3:42] we had that kind of attitude towards the
[3:44] gospel oh we're we're this is it we're
[3:46] done nobody else nobody else can hear it
[3:48] nobody else is going to see it I'm not
[3:49] going to I'm not going to express this
[3:51] I'm not going to share this then it just
[3:52] ends it's over and so if we're not going
[3:55] to be merciful nobody's going to obtain
[3:57] Mercy I don't know how that connects
[3:59] with a pyramid SCH but we'll come back
[4:01] around it kids eat free and now in John
[4:05] 20: 23 we've been looking at the
[4:07] scripture personally as we've been
[4:09] studying and then we uh focused on a
[4:11] little bit on Sunday he's speaking to
[4:13] the believer now this is his commission
[4:16] to the disciples before the day of
[4:18] Pentecost and even in this particular
[4:20] instance this is him speaking you'll see
[4:22] it in Luke 24 here it's recounted in
[4:24] John 20 at the time of his resurrection
[4:27] and so he is resurrected he is the resur
[4:29] Ed Christ he is The Mercy Seat in plain
[4:32] view now he's revealed himself to the
[4:34] disciples after his resurrection and
[4:36] he's telling them that repentance and
[4:38] remission of sins must be preached in
[4:40] all the world and he says whosoever sins
[4:42] ye remit they are remitted unto them and
[4:45] whosoever sins you retain they are
[4:49] retained and brother Bram said this is a
[4:51] commission to the church she is to do
[4:54] this now not in a Catholic sense but
[4:56] there is a way that this was
[4:58] accomplished and we saw brother brand
[4:59] giving us great detail in several
[5:02] statements on Sunday that the church has
[5:04] power to remit
[5:06] sins now that's significant it's
[5:09] scriptural now there's a way maybe we
[5:10] could twist that and turn it into
[5:12] something that is not as the Catholics
[5:13] have demonstrated but yet we know there
[5:15] is a truth to this that we should desire
[5:18] to be partakers
[5:20] of now in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 we'll
[5:23] pick up with verse 18 and I'll just read
[5:26] to verse 20 here says and all things are
[5:28] of God who hath re reconciled us to
[5:31] himself by Jesus Christ so Christ has
[5:35] reconciled us to God and we having been
[5:37] reconciled to God we're new creatures in
[5:40] Christ Jesus and then as a part of this
[5:43] reconciliation what we're seeing then is
[5:45] Christ revealed himself to the disciples
[5:47] and he sat down he was communing with
[5:49] them it wasn't just fellowship and
[5:51] communion uh among them or between uh
[5:54] the disciple in Christ but Christ is
[5:55] going to speak to them and command them
[5:58] he says you go and whoever sins you
[6:00] remit they are remitted whichever sins
[6:02] are retained they are retained and so
[6:04] we've been reconciled to God by Jesus
[6:07] Christ the mercy seek and we have been
[6:10] given the ministry of
[6:14] reconciliation so it's not we haven't
[6:16] just been reconciled but being
[6:18] reconciled we become
[6:20] reconcilers and that word reconciliation
[6:23] is
[6:24] atonement I think of how deep that is he
[6:27] has given us the ministry of
[6:30] atonement this is uh the ability to to
[6:33] restore to favor to plate that wrath
[6:36] whatever we think of the atonement in
[6:37] the Old Testament says it's given us
[6:39] this ministry of reconciliation that was
[6:42] a symbol of reconciliation now we've
[6:44] been given the ministry of atonement to
[6:47] it that God was in Christ reconciling
[6:50] the world unto himself not imputing
[6:53] their trespasses unto them so there's
[6:55] the image of God in Christ through
[6:58] reconciling the world and hath committed
[7:01] unto us the word of atonement the word
[7:05] of reconciliation so this is we are not
[7:08] just under the atonement but now we have
[7:10] the ministry of atonement we have not
[7:13] just had our sins atoned for but we've
[7:15] been given the word of atonement so
[7:18] minister of reconciliation the word of
[7:20] reconciliation and now then we are
[7:22] ambassadors for Christ that we are his
[7:26] Representatives we are his body we are
[7:28] his voice and though God did beseech as
[7:30] though God did beseech You by us we pray
[7:32] you in Christ's stead the church taking
[7:36] the place of Christ carried on his
[7:37] ministry in Christ dead be you
[7:39] reconciled to God so we have as
[7:43] Believers the ministry of atonement what
[7:46] and I'm going to take some scriptures
[7:48] here just to emphasize uh this through
[7:50] the Bible what this means if we have the
[7:52] ministry of atonement it is the voice of
[7:55] the blood speaking amen it is the voice
[7:57] of Mercy
[8:00] let's look at this ministry of atonement
[8:02] because if there's going to be atonement
[8:03] there has to be blood Leviticus
[8:06] 17:1 for the life of the flesh is in the
[8:09] blood and I have given it to you upon
[8:11] the altar to make an atonement for your
[8:13] souls for it is the blood that maketh an
[8:16] atonement for the soul now we know
[8:19] according to the Token that the life is
[8:21] in the blood and that the token is not
[8:24] the chemistry of the blood but we know
[8:26] the token is the life and so if blood's
[8:28] speaking it's not the chemical
[8:30] composition of the blood but it's life
[8:32] speaking it's what that life represents
[8:35] and here he's saying the life of the
[8:36] flesh is in the blood when this blood is
[8:39] shed and this life would expire through
[8:42] the giving of a sacrifice he says it's
[8:44] that blood because it symbolizes the
[8:46] life being given it makes an atonement
[8:49] for the soul amen so it's through the
[8:51] shedding of blood which speaks of a life
[8:54] that's what there there must be uh that
[8:56] is what's required for atonement in
[8:59] Hebrews chapter 9: 20 21 and 22 speaking
[9:04] about Moses Moses saying this is the
[9:06] blood of the testament which God hath
[9:08] enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled
[9:11] the blood with both he sprinkled with
[9:14] blood both the Tabernacle and all the
[9:16] vessels of the ministry and almost all
[9:19] things by the law purged with blood
[9:23] almost all things are by the law purged
[9:25] with blood and without shedding of blood
[9:28] there is no
[9:30] remission so there has to be a shedding
[9:34] of blood we see this in the mercy seat
[9:36] if there's no blood on The Mercy Seat
[9:37] it's only a judgment seat and as the
[9:40] blood upon The Mercy Seat that's where
[9:41] where God would commune that's where God
[9:43] would speak and it's saying that without
[9:45] the shedding of blood there is no
[9:47] remission without a witness or a
[9:50] Ministry of the blood there can be no
[9:52] forgiveness of sins there is no
[9:54] remitting so when we testify or when we
[9:57] were to preach if you're going to wanted
[9:59] to be one as you go out and the gospel
[10:01] be preached All Nations you have to be
[10:03] preaching Christ and it's not a dead
[10:06] Christ it's a resurrected Christ and it
[10:08] is a Ministry of the life or the blood
[10:11] that was shed whosoever sins you remit
[10:14] they are remitted without the shedding
[10:15] of blood there is no remission there is
[10:17] no atonement so we have been given a
[10:19] Ministry of the blood we've been given a
[10:22] Ministry of
[10:24] atonement Matthew chap 26: 28 Jesus when
[10:28] he's given the symbols of communion he
[10:31] says for this is my blood of the new
[10:32] testament which is shed for many for the
[10:35] remission of sins so if there's if
[10:38] there's no blood there cannot be
[10:39] remission of sins there's no
[10:41] representation of that if there's no if
[10:43] there's no life speaking of the blood
[10:45] there can be no remission of sins now
[10:47] let's connect that with the idea that
[10:49] when the bride's gone there's no more
[10:50] salvation there's no more blood amen
[10:53] there's no more representation there's
[10:54] no more voice in the earth calling out
[10:57] uh to The Sinner for them to come under
[11:00] the
[11:01] atonement in Romans 3:25 so we noes the
[11:04] shedding of blood which is given for the
[11:06] remission of sins says whom God has set
[11:08] forth to be Christ to be a mercy seat or
[11:11] a perpetuation through faith in his
[11:14] blood to declare his righteousness for
[11:17] the remission of sins that are passed
[11:19] through the forbearance of God so Christ
[11:22] is The Mercy Seat by faith in his blood
[11:25] and because there's blood it can declare
[11:27] his righteousness for the remission of
[11:29] sins I put that into this image of the
[11:32] church who's washed in his blood she is
[11:34] sinless she's going forth with the
[11:36] ministry of atonement therefore the sins
[11:39] you remit in order to be able to have
[11:42] this power to remit sins you must have
[11:45] identification with the blood there must
[11:48] be identification with Christ and I
[11:50] think the best way that I could just sum
[11:52] it up is go listen to the Token or token
[11:54] or a token there's different ways uh
[11:57] that it's titled so if you search the
[11:58] token you won't get all of
[12:01] them uh what I mean is you won't get
[12:03] them in the list of sermons so token a
[12:05] token the token you should pull up a few
[12:08] there four or five to listen
[12:10] to
[12:12] now I'm not I don't feel like I'm
[12:14] treading a fine line but I do recognize
[12:17] that for some uh this could be a
[12:19] controversial subject as I said before
[12:22] um I know many people that would say uh
[12:25] Mercy is in the bride they would go so
[12:27] far as to say The Mercy Seat is in the
[12:28] bride
[12:30] and there's others who would hear that
[12:32] and take great offense uh and feel that
[12:34] that's going too far and so I'm not
[12:36] necessarily calling out names or trying
[12:38] to pick a camp there but there's
[12:40] scarecrows and there's fanaticism and
[12:42] there's a lot of ways that these things
[12:44] can be twisted to where
[12:46] it's uh it's it can be presented as
[12:50] something that it's actually not but
[12:52] then there can also be a resistance to
[12:54] actually what it really is that there
[12:57] could be this reluctance well the the
[12:59] bride shouldn't be taken the bride can't
[13:01] take the place of Christ well true
[13:03] there's just actually no way to
[13:05] literally go back and pay the price and
[13:08] die on a cross and shed blood for sins
[13:09] we can't go back and be the historical
[13:11] Christ but we know we were in him and we
[13:14] know that today brother B said she is
[13:16] him that there's this Paradox of Oneness
[13:19] and this representation of Christ today
[13:21] where we are supposed to be carrying on
[13:24] his ministry and carrying on his work
[13:26] that we are to be vessels of Mercy that
[13:28] others who are not Believers that
[13:30] through our Mercy they can obtain mercy
[13:32] and that we must be fulfilling the
[13:33] scripture that says whosoever sins you
[13:35] remit they are
[13:37] remitted there there is a Ministry of
[13:40] atonement for us to continue to walk in
[13:42] amen now if that begins to build a
[13:44] picture it says well you're trying to
[13:46] make yourself out to be Christ himself
[13:48] the mercy seed and you're the bleeding
[13:50] bloody lamb uh well you know I don't
[13:53] think we even need to go there but
[13:55] brother Brenham says and the Mighty God
[13:56] unveiled before us he says and they say
[13:58] well you people try to take the place of
[14:03] God that's that sounds about it right he
[14:06] said that's not too far out that's
[14:09] exactly what it is that's exactly God
[14:13] manifested in flesh just as he promised
[14:16] well you try to take the place of God
[14:17] you try to you're making yourself out to
[14:19] be God you're making yourself out to be
[14:21] Christ and you're you're taking the
[14:22] place of Jesus and you're doing away
[14:25] with Jesus no we're just you should come
[14:27] into the place that Jesus but for you am
[14:30] you should stand with all that you can
[14:32] for that for who Christ is and what he
[14:35] did for you and he says well you're
[14:36] taking the place of God he said that's
[14:38] not too far out and I love that because
[14:39] it kind of implies it's not too far off
[14:42] and then he says that's exactly what it
[14:44] is amen and I'm reminded of how
[14:48] sometimes we can get very uh defensive
[14:51] of
[14:51] Christ and I know that I've expressed
[14:53] this illustration before but that we
[14:55] might take offense and be very zealous
[14:57] for Jesus Christ a and we draw our
[15:00] swords in defense of Christ just as
[15:03] Peter did there in the garden and it
[15:05] caused what did it cause it caused
[15:07] nothing but the shedding of blood
[15:09] incorrectly cut off a man's ear why he
[15:12] was zealous to defend Jesus Christ and
[15:14] and Jesus is saying you're an offense
[15:17] Peter because he says you'll never die
[15:18] and I'll never let this happen and far
[15:20] be it from me to let you die and he
[15:22] actually rebukes Peter and says this
[15:23] must be fulfilled so Peter in his Zeal
[15:27] to defend Jesus Christ was working
[15:29] against the word of God and we have to
[15:32] be careful that in our platitudes and
[15:34] the the the the lip service we want to
[15:36] pay to Jesus Christ and then well it's
[15:38] just all about Jesus and we just love
[15:40] Jesus that if you're not careful you can
[15:42] actually begin to tear him down in your
[15:45] defense of him because you're drawing
[15:48] the sword against the word today that's
[15:50] exactly what uh Peter was essentially
[15:52] doing in his Zeal but then it's also
[15:55] exactly what Paul was doing in defense
[15:56] of God a penos a zealot and he is
[15:59] actually persecuting Jesus so it's
[16:01] something to really consider how that
[16:04] there is a taking the place of
[16:08] Christ just as he
[16:11] promised now he's using this scripture
[16:13] he that believeth on me the works that I
[16:15] do shall he do also in John chap 14:2
[16:19] verily verily I say unto you he that
[16:20] believeth on me the works that I do
[16:22] shall he do also that's he that
[16:25] believeth that's a very clear uh promise
[16:28] in the Bible and then this is a another
[16:31] promise and Greater Works than these
[16:33] shall he do because I go unto my
[16:36] father so he that believeth shall do the
[16:39] works that he does and then this
[16:42] declaration that because he goes to the
[16:45] father there'll be greater
[16:46] works and there
[16:49] is this is an end time there's an end
[16:52] time fulfillment in Prophecy to this I
[16:55] can take you through a number of
[16:56] different places there's several
[16:58] different places you go through brother
[16:59] bram's making uh comments on this
[17:02] scripture and he reads for John 14:12 in
[17:04] one place he says that great promise
[17:07] today he takes this in another place and
[17:10] he says John 14:12 his word that's
[17:13] promised for this day now regardless of
[17:17] how this was fulfilled in Prior ages and
[17:19] regardless of whether it was I I won't
[17:21] even say it hasn't been but I will say
[17:23] it's to be fulfilled today if it has
[17:26] before it's to be fulfilled today as
[17:28] well well yes sometimes we kind of make
[17:30] this uh we kind of have this exercise of
[17:33] trying to go and figure out what what
[17:34] has always been but I can say regardless
[17:36] of what has been it's for today that it
[17:39] must be fulfilled today as well and in
[17:42] the sermon there is a man here that can
[17:43] turn on the light which I think is a
[17:46] very important one in this this series
[17:48] that we've been talking about as far as
[17:49] from the absolute and the signs of
[17:51] judgment a and mercy says listen I want
[17:54] to just take you now and he says and let
[17:57] this be personal so we all want to take
[17:59] this personal look watch this he is the
[18:02] same yesterday today and forever his
[18:04] works that he did manifest itself now
[18:07] listen close when he stood there in John
[18:09] 14:12 he said the works that I do shall
[18:12] you do also greater than this shall you
[18:16] do for I go unto my father now he said
[18:18] it heavens and earth will pass away but
[18:21] that word will never fail now for at the
[18:24] last end of the age where are them
[18:26] Greater Works going to come know how he
[18:29] kind of says well then if we're there at
[18:30] the End of the Age if we're in the end
[18:32] time if we're at this very moment where
[18:33] everything's going to be sealed up and
[18:35] done and over if we're at the end of
[18:36] time where are those Greater Works going
[18:38] to come from and he says we are
[18:42] here there's uh there's a special
[18:45] application then of this a special
[18:47] manifestation of this something that
[18:49] Christ when he says in Greater work
[18:51] shall you
[18:52] do and and and I guess I I'll just say
[18:56] it this way it really is a paradox I
[18:58] mean how could you greater than what he
[18:59] did he says greater than these things
[19:02] shall you do because I go unto my father
[19:05] and there is this manifestation of this
[19:07] John 14:12 it's a promise today we want
[19:10] to get in the rhythm of the word for
[19:12] today to find the purpose of the word of
[19:14] God today where are those Greater Works
[19:15] going to come from because we're
[19:18] here so now I don't know if any of you
[19:20] went and listened to that day on Calvary
[19:23] and if you did you've already got these
[19:25] maybe you already have this come to your
[19:26] mind here brother asked the question
[19:28] what is eternal life the life that he
[19:31] lived the life that was in him impart
[19:34] that to
[19:35] others can a man do that Son of God Can
[19:40] Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to
[19:42] them they are remitted whosoever sins
[19:44] you retain to them they are retained now
[19:47] here's where the Catholic church and
[19:48] many of the others made their big
[19:49] mistake they go out and say I forgive
[19:52] your sins that wasn't it how did they
[19:54] get sins forgiven in the Bible pet Peter
[19:57] answered that question question on the
[19:59] day of Pentecost they said what can we
[20:01] do to be saved how can we get this that
[20:03] you all got he laid down the
[20:05] prescription he told them what to do he
[20:08] said repent every one of you towards God
[20:10] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[20:12] Christ what for the remission of sins
[20:16] there is the Greater
[20:19] Works now that's that that's a very
[20:21] specific
[20:23] emphasis that there's to to be a an
[20:26] ability in The Believer to he says to
[20:29] impart that eternal life to others he
[20:32] connects it with John 20:23 whosoever
[20:34] sends you remit they are remitted and he
[20:36] says well then how do we do it not by
[20:38] going around and blessing people and
[20:39] saying your sins are forgiven but by the
[20:41] word of reconciliation the ministry of
[20:44] atonement being preached being presented
[20:46] and that being received and with they
[20:48] follow the prescription they too would
[20:51] receive this baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:53] they would have their sins remitted he
[20:55] says there's the Greater Works notice
[20:57] this is on the day of Pentecost so on
[21:00] the day of Pentecost there was tongues
[21:02] and there was shouting dancing there was
[21:03] a great enthusiasm but here's Peter
[21:06] standing up on the day of Pentecost as a
[21:08] Voice of Truth revealing Jesus Christ to
[21:11] be the Son of God and calling people to
[21:14] repentance we find that in the leod Dean
[21:16] age there was a great restoration of the
[21:18] gifts but this is what Peter's talking
[21:20] about here what brother Brown's poting
[21:21] out here about the great at works this
[21:23] isn't a restoration of gifts this is a
[21:26] book of Acts amen good this is the voice
[21:29] of Mercy at Pentecost if there's going
[21:30] to be a fullness of Pentecost restored
[21:32] if the church is going to come back to
[21:34] the church it was on the day of
[21:35] Pentecost well signs and wonders
[21:37] healings and manifestations and all
[21:39] sorts of gifts and miracles but there
[21:40] must also be a voice that speaks that
[21:43] brings people to the genuine atonement
[21:46] to the revelation of Jesus Christ and if
[21:48] that's missing it's all just for show
[21:51] good brother brandham it it I believe
[21:54] addresses that in this way continuing in
[21:57] that day on Calvary the greater Works
[21:58] were to have the power the Greater Works
[22:01] was to have the power in the church not
[22:03] only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out
[22:05] Devils by prayer but to impart eternal
[22:08] life to Believers amen I'm I'm not
[22:11] trying to explain this figure it out you
[22:13] know talking about how this works and
[22:15] how there's this uh this force field
[22:18] that you begin to enter into and but
[22:20] he's just he's bringing something for us
[22:22] to really consider I want us to give
[22:25] some real thought to these things and
[22:28] may not be putting it uh together well
[22:30] enough tonight or minister in a way to
[22:32] where your understanding will strike but
[22:33] hopefully Enough by putting it out there
[22:35] you'll just really think about
[22:38] it but to impart eternal life to
[22:40] Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and
[22:42] given into the hands of the church to
[22:43] impart life oh that's what Calvary meant
[22:47] he took stooped degraded men and women
[22:49] and lifted them into a place to be Sons
[22:51] and Daughters of God to heal the sick
[22:53] and to impart eternal life by giving the
[22:57] Holy Ghost to obedient believer men who
[22:59] were once unbelievers be made Believers
[23:01] and inart spiritual eternal life how
[23:05] much greater is it to say to this sick
[23:07] woman laying here I can pray a prayer of
[23:09] faith and she'll be healed that's a
[23:11] great thing that's what he was doing
[23:13] then but said greater than this shall
[23:15] you do I'm going to give you power not
[23:18] only to raise him up for a while but to
[23:20] give him eternal life which will be
[23:22] Eternal
[23:24] forever and this now I I realize that it
[23:28] reading these things and it's not
[23:30] necessar something brother Brown's
[23:31] always teaching and always detailing and
[23:33] so it just becomes real common for us to
[23:34] hear it this may seem to be somewhat of
[23:36] an outlier but I believe when you look
[23:38] at it in the P the the maybe in the
[23:40] context we've been building over the
[23:42] last several Services you can see wow
[23:44] there there there's something brother R
[23:45] was pointing us to something and and
[23:48] even as it relates to how he was calling
[23:51] out Leo deia and saying people don't
[23:54] recognize it today the Throne of God is
[23:56] in man and there was always this this
[23:58] correction to the church he does the
[24:00] same thing here he says which will uh
[24:02] but to give him eternal life which will
[24:04] be Eternal forever poor blind wretched
[24:06] people how do you miss that it's a
[24:09] sudden rebuke don't you see what the
[24:12] greater thing is that's the greatest
[24:14] thing that could ever happen was to
[24:16] impart eternal life to
[24:19] people again that's that's quite a
[24:21] statement and I know we we may want to
[24:23] use it kind of as like just a magic wand
[24:26] right like a I Dream of Genie or
[24:27] Bewitched or something just twinkle your
[24:29] nose or something a and be able to
[24:31] impart eternal life as some sort of uh
[24:33] magical power but yet we know the power
[24:37] is there through the right
[24:38] channel to impart eternal life to people
[24:42] brother says he's talking to the
[24:43] ministers and those out on the tapes he
[24:45] says what does Calvary mean to you what'
[24:48] that day do to you did it stuff you out
[24:51] with some theology did it make you a
[24:53] stuffed shirt or did it make you a
[24:55] Christian sold out sins remitted
[24:59] Greater Works than this shall you do you
[25:01] see where the where the yays are don't
[25:04] you Greater Works than this remitting
[25:07] sins in the name of Jesus Christ but
[25:11] through Creeds and denominations and so
[25:13] forth it's bound you down to a place
[25:16] you're still serving the
[25:20] world this bondage to the world he's
[25:24] saying that we ought to be doing Greater
[25:26] Works in the name of Jesus Christ but
[25:28] its Creed denominations have bound you
[25:30] down to a place you're still serving the
[25:31] world now if you could look at this in
[25:34] the premise as we mentioned Sunday
[25:35] what's the premise well there's this
[25:37] premise that denominationalism had
[25:39] become so bound up that Christ is kicked
[25:42] out of the
[25:43] church I'm going to make a statement
[25:45] there's no more life in there there's no
[25:47] more seed in there there's no more
[25:49] salvation in there that that's not where
[25:51] Christ has revealed himself he can't be
[25:52] found the voice of God is not in the
[25:55] organizations he's not in denominations
[25:57] and that's what represents this change
[25:59] so dramatically here in the end of time
[26:01] and that's the real premise of the
[26:03] message of the hour is that man has so
[26:06] bound Christ through Creeds and dogmas
[26:08] and he's saying that there's people who
[26:10] are so Bound by their denominational
[26:12] Creeds they can't bring people to Christ
[26:14] they only produce stillborn
[26:17] children there there's not sins aren't
[26:19] being remitted the word's not being
[26:21] preached the blood's not
[26:23] covering and brother bramman there's the
[26:25] rising of the sun this is a real
[26:27] important sermon I'll try to pull from
[26:30] here in a little bit he says and because
[26:32] I live you shall you live also and I
[26:35] live in you and the works that I do and
[26:37] brother brandom quotes John 14:12 The
[26:39] Works that I do I will identify myself
[26:42] in you what a
[26:45] message no wonder we've had dark a dark
[26:48] World theology world of theology but in
[26:51] the evening time there shall come light
[26:53] again there will be a resurrection in
[26:56] the evening time it shall be light at
[26:59] the evening time it is the rising of the
[27:03] sun because I live ye shall live also
[27:07] quite a statement because I live you
[27:09] shall live also and Greater Works he
[27:10] brings John 14:12 and this end time
[27:13] there will be a resurrection in the
[27:14] evening time just as there was a
[27:16] resurrection there in John and as he's
[27:18] resurrected and he's communing he's
[27:20] feasting with the disciples he's
[27:21] commissioning them to go out and to
[27:24] finish this work and to meet on the day
[27:26] of Pentecost and the power of God's
[27:27] going to be out he says there'll be a
[27:29] resurrection in the evening time there
[27:30] will be light in the evening time there
[27:32] will be John 14:12 in this evening time
[27:36] Greater Works shall you
[27:38] do he says Greater Works in this
[27:40] remitting sins in the name of Jesus
[27:43] Christ now one of the sermons that we
[27:47] referenced in in this theme of the voice
[27:50] of Mercy is the Third Exodus I think
[27:52] there's a lot of themes there to draw on
[27:55] I had been uh there was a lot of things
[27:57] i' had been studying on in Exodus CH 12
[27:59] and I wanted to bring a lot more things
[28:01] out in this but and I hope this isn't
[28:04] too much of a jump but I want you to see
[28:06] this in the Exodus in Exodus chapter 12
[28:08] it's at a dark time it's a terrible time
[28:10] the time of signs and wonders it's a
[28:12] time of we can use as a type of the
[28:13] Rapture before they go and how the last
[28:16] plague that was going to hit Egypt was
[28:17] death and so if you weren't under the
[28:20] blood you're judged and so that's a
[28:23] great type for where we are today if
[28:24] you're not under the blood you're judged
[28:26] so there's Mercy in the blood there's
[28:28] Mercy in the atonement there's Mercy In
[28:30] following the instructions there's Mercy
[28:32] in gathering your place in that under
[28:34] the shelter of the blood and if you're
[28:36] outside the blood there's judgment and
[28:38] here it's expressed in the scripture in
[28:40] Exodus 12: 12 and 13 for I will pass
[28:43] through the land of Egypt this night and
[28:45] will Smite all the firstborn in the land
[28:47] of Egypt both man and Beast and against
[28:49] all the gods of Egypt I will execute
[28:52] judgment I am the Lord so here's God
[28:56] going to be revealed himself in this
[28:57] dark time in this end time and he's
[28:59] revealed
[29:00] himself uh as judge Death Angel is going
[29:04] to pass through the land and he's going
[29:06] to judge the firstborn man and Beast
[29:09] throughout the land of Egypt and Against
[29:11] The Gods of Egypt he's executing
[29:13] judgment so in this time where God is
[29:15] executing judgment he had spoke to Moses
[29:18] and and instituted the Passover and he
[29:21] told them that they are to go and every
[29:22] man take a lamb according to their house
[29:26] and it said a lamb for a house
[29:29] and that if there was if it was too if
[29:31] family was too small that they were to
[29:32] come together they were to gather
[29:34] together and they were to take the blood
[29:36] of this lamb and they were to strike it
[29:38] on the doorpost and the lentil and they
[29:40] were to apply it and it was going to be
[29:42] an outward sign that they were inside
[29:45] eating the lamb as it had been prep they
[29:47] had been told to prepare it dressed as
[29:50] they were told to dress because they
[29:51] were going to eat in haste because the
[29:53] death angel was going to pass through
[29:54] and then they were going to go and so
[29:57] the blood was was going to be uh put on
[29:59] the doorpost and the lentil on the
[30:01] outside the blood was going to be placed
[30:03] there and it was going to be a sign
[30:06] everyone was going to see it it's going
[30:07] to be a visible token but it was not
[30:10] everybody who saw that was like oh wow
[30:12] they're going to live if they didn't
[30:13] know the word they just thought well
[30:15] that's a really weird
[30:18] display and this is what the scripture
[30:21] says in verse 13 and the blood the blood
[30:24] of this lamb shall be to you for a token
[30:27] of upon the houses where you are and
[30:30] when I see the blood I will pass over
[30:33] you it's the Feast of the Passover what
[30:36] was passing over
[30:37] judgment execution death he that
[30:40] believeth on me shall never die but is
[30:43] passed from Death un life that's what
[30:44] this Pascal lamb what that's what this
[30:46] Blood represents for us when I see the
[30:48] blood I will pass over you and the
[30:50] plague shall not come upon you to
[30:52] destroy you when I smite the land of
[30:54] Egypt so there there was a time where uh
[30:59] things even in this Exodus as plagues
[31:03] were poured out and these different
[31:04] signs and wonders are taking place it
[31:07] came to a time and a terrible hour where
[31:10] you couldn't just rely on the fact that
[31:11] you had been in the church you couldn't
[31:14] just rely on the fact that you were on
[31:15] the right side you had been in Goan when
[31:17] this happened and you'd been over here
[31:19] when that happened and you had been
[31:20] protected from all these plagues there
[31:22] came a time where now finally you have
[31:24] to be under the blood and someone could
[31:27] say well I've I believe the message and
[31:29] I've been in it so far and you know the
[31:31] lice didn't get us and the frogs didn't
[31:32] get us and the that uh all these things
[31:35] didn't get us and we've been you
[31:36] remember when it was really really dark
[31:38] out there and our all the Egyptians were
[31:40] blind but we could see because we're
[31:42] we're Believers we're Israelites there
[31:44] came a time when you could no longer uh
[31:46] Bank on those prior experiences that God
[31:49] had been manifesting himself you had to
[31:51] be under the
[31:53] blood I want you to think of this in
[31:55] terms of the hour that we have arrived
[31:57] here in in the end times and brother
[31:59] bandam said those trinitarian brother
[32:01] Bram are those trinitarians are they
[32:02] going to go to hell he said I believe
[32:04] they're Christians but the hours
[32:06] approaching brother when they are
[32:07] sincerely wrong yes we see a similar
[32:11] pattern in the book of Exodus you could
[32:13] have been there all the way to chapter
[32:14] 12 and say well I've seen all the
[32:16] Miracles I've seen all the signs I
[32:17] believe Moses is a prophet and he said
[32:20] well you better listen to what he said
[32:22] you better you better hear what he said
[32:24] was so important in this end time and so
[32:26] important when judg was
[32:28] coming now this is just a small slice of
[32:31] this but listen and the when brother BR
[32:33] preaches token in Jeffersonville he said
[32:35] it was evening time when the token was
[32:37] required not in the morning not in the
[32:40] preparation the 14 days of the keeping
[32:42] of the Lamb Israel knew something was
[32:44] coming and now he brings it right to our
[32:47] day and I find myself
[32:51] um I feel that I just want to pause and
[32:54] try to think back to some of the sermons
[32:56] we preached recently where we're wanting
[32:58] you to see how that there was uh there
[33:03] was a manifestation in Luther and Wesley
[33:05] and on through the church ages and there
[33:07] was the the ignorance brother BR said
[33:10] God the Son of God interceding over the
[33:11] ignorance of the people and the hour
[33:13] approaching when they're sincerely wrong
[33:16] and so there's this point at which you
[33:18] come to the hour and time of
[33:21] redemption and that you can't be on the
[33:24] outside you've got to be on the
[33:26] inside and so brother he he transitions
[33:29] now to the church ages so did Luther
[33:32] know it know what there something was
[33:34] coming so did Wesley know it so did
[33:36] finny Knox Calvin know it this is
[33:38] it they knew there would come a time
[33:40] that the pillar fired return back to the
[33:42] church they knew there would come a time
[33:44] that these things would happen but they
[33:45] didn't live to see it but they looked
[33:47] forward to see it Israel knew something
[33:50] was coming but it was in the evening
[33:53] time when that Lamb's blood the token
[33:55] was placed on the door so there this
[33:58] time finally when the blood has to be
[34:00] shed and it's this visible token a lot
[34:03] of a lot of Sy symbolism in that he says
[34:05] yet the lamb was already put up now this
[34:09] is to me it's brother using a language
[34:11] not to put us in a box or put God in a
[34:13] box and say well this is the only way to
[34:15] see it but to put it in a sense that we
[34:16] can understand how that we've arrived at
[34:18] a time in the end where God having had
[34:21] mercy throughout the church ages and it
[34:23] was still always the lamb always was The
[34:26] Mercy Seat but now the seals are are
[34:27] open it's not that there it's bloodless
[34:30] and there's no more Mercy but it's only
[34:32] found in one
[34:34] place cuz he says it was the lamb was
[34:37] already put up they put it up for 14
[34:39] days and they kept it he says it's been
[34:40] the lamb all the way through it has to
[34:43] be Christ he said it was the lamb in
[34:45] Luther's time it was the lamb in
[34:47] Wesley's time but now is the token time
[34:50] that each house must be covered by the
[34:53] token amen each house of God must be
[34:56] covered by the token all that's inside
[34:58] of it must be covered by the token and
[35:01] the house of God is the body of Jesus
[35:03] Christ and by one Spirit we're all
[35:05] baptized into this token and become a
[35:08] part of it that God said when I see this
[35:10] token displayed I will pass over you
[35:14] what an hour that we're now
[35:16] living it's always been the lamb it's
[35:20] always been Christ interceding it's
[35:22] always been Christ there H uh making an
[35:25] atonement and interceding
[35:27] but now something has transpired in this
[35:29] end
[35:32] time where it's the life the token
[35:37] life I I I just want to I want to leave
[35:39] it in these statements for you to chew
[35:42] on brother bam says therefore in the
[35:43] last days of Luther it was thought to
[35:45] believe in the days of Wesley the
[35:48] chemistry of the blood but this is the
[35:49] last day where the token is required and
[35:52] that makes together the whole unit for
[35:55] the rapture
[35:58] I believe that what he's looking at is
[35:59] we read the statement here in a moment
[36:01] is how that we're all working together
[36:03] and he quotes in Hebrews that they
[36:04] without us should not be made perfect
[36:06] and as Paul saw that they that had been
[36:08] in the Old Testament Church that they
[36:11] were not made perfect without those
[36:12] Jewish Believers receiving their Messiah
[36:15] brother BR brings it to a parallel to us
[36:17] and he says that they without us could
[36:18] not be made perfect that the New
[36:20] Testament foreshadow and the church ages
[36:22] foreshadow the coming of a Perfect Bride
[36:25] that is the climax of all the church of
[36:28] all the redeemed so where we are today
[36:31] in its uh very specific distinction is
[36:34] the token is required to make the whole
[36:35] unit for the
[36:37] Rapture he says and the church in this
[36:39] day that's received the token of the
[36:41] baptism of the holy spirit that the
[36:43] blood has been shed and that the Holy
[36:45] Ghost is upon the church without us then
[36:47] they cannot raise but they're depending
[36:50] on us God promised he would have it and
[36:54] somebody's going to be there I don't
[36:57] know who going to be but somebody's
[36:59] going to receive it God's promised this
[37:01] it's got to be there uh without us they
[37:04] cannot raise we say who's the US it's
[37:07] got to be
[37:08] somebody God they're depending on us God
[37:10] promised that he would have it
[37:12] somebody's going to be there I don't
[37:13] know who's going to be there but
[37:14] somebody's going to receive it the only
[37:16] one thing I'm responsible is to preach
[37:18] it it's God's business to look out for
[37:20] that predestinated seed there's going to
[37:22] be there though because they're going to
[37:24] be there each one of them one with the
[37:27] other the water age the blood age and
[37:29] now the token age of the Holy
[37:33] Ghost the token age of the Holy
[37:36] Ghost got to be he said has to be under
[37:39] the house of God is the body of Christ
[37:42] has to be under the
[37:44] token and brother brandham in that
[37:46] sermon he's preaching he says the blood
[37:47] of Jesus Christ cries
[37:49] out and he says but there's forgiveness
[37:51] in it if you'll just accept it so it's a
[37:54] voice of
[37:55] judgment the the blood of Jesus Christ
[37:58] cries out there's a voice of Mercy in
[38:00] this end time and maybe when you hear it
[38:01] it's condemning and it's accusatory and
[38:04] it speaks of punishment it speaks of
[38:05] death and it speaks of rejection but if
[38:07] you'll accept it there's forgiveness in
[38:12] it as brother bram's uh laying these
[38:15] things out just one more uh perspective
[38:18] I want to add to this especially in the
[38:21] the this Dark Age that we're living in
[38:24] and brother B says there's going to be a
[38:25] resurrection in the evening time
[38:28] a time when there's been Creeds and
[38:30] denominations that have so bound down
[38:31] the people that they're blind and
[38:33] miserable and naked and wretched and
[38:34] don't know it it's The Darkest Hour
[38:36] there's ever been but in that time of
[38:37] gloominess and despair and darkness it
[38:39] shall be light it is the rising of the
[38:43] sun and the blood of Jesus cries out and
[38:46] if you'll accept it there's
[38:48] forgiveness and if you don't it's
[38:50] judgment right and so Jeremiah CH
[38:55] 22:5 just taking this one statement he
[38:58] says but if you will not hear these
[39:00] words I swear by myself sayi the Lord
[39:02] that this house shall become a
[39:04] desolation so a great warning to Israel
[39:07] if you don't obey if you don't do what I
[39:09] say if you don't follow my voice then
[39:10] you'll become desolate you become judged
[39:12] you'll you'll suffer
[39:14] Vengeance and sure enough it happens in
[39:17] chapter 25 we know that they do not
[39:20] obey the voice of the Lord says moreover
[39:23] I will take from them the voice of Mirth
[39:26] and the voice of gladness the voice of
[39:28] the bridegroom and the voice of the
[39:29] Bride the sound of the millstones its
[39:32] work its business and the light of the
[39:34] candle and this whole land shall be a
[39:37] desolation and an astonishment now why
[39:40] does it come to this because they would
[39:42] not hear his voice and because they
[39:45] would not accept him because they would
[39:47] not hear his voice there was uh
[39:49] consequence there was judgment they
[39:51] became a desolation and an astonishment
[39:53] and these nations Shall Serve the king
[39:55] of Babylon 70 years so this is prophecy
[39:58] of Israel's 70 years of bondage their 70
[40:01] years of bondage is a type of
[40:02] denominational bondage in the church
[40:05] ages we if we not even take a time to go
[40:08] through Babylonian Rule and the Dark
[40:10] Ages and the Conquering the tearing down
[40:12] of the church and the Conquering of the
[40:14] church by the Catholic Spirit and the
[40:16] Antichrist we know that when we arrive
[40:18] at the L DEC age Christ has been put out
[40:21] of the church can even look at the sense
[40:23] of the church is still
[40:25] sleeping in the parable for form but
[40:28] then we come to the age of full
[40:30] Redemption restoration a lot of themes
[40:32] that I'm just wanting to point back to
[40:34] it's not a Reformation under the spirit
[40:35] of man but it's full
[40:38] Redemption and you can see this parallel
[40:40] even in the book of Jeremiah you can see
[40:43] how that they were under a bondage they
[40:44] were in Babylon but God's going to call
[40:46] them out of Babylon bring them back to
[40:48] Jerusalem and restore the house of the
[40:50] Lord going to bring them back to the
[40:51] rightful place and so in Jeremiah 25
[40:54] it's a prophecy of Jerusalem being
[40:56] desolate and broken it's not a Dwelling
[40:58] Place of God nor is it a Dwelling Place
[40:59] of his people this is where God was to
[41:02] dwell amongst his people they was going
[41:03] to build the house of the Lord and the
[41:05] temple and the walls were erected and
[41:06] God was going to be there behind the
[41:08] veil and upon the ark and this was where
[41:10] God would commune and this is where the
[41:11] people would come to and bring their
[41:13] sacrifices and this great holy city of
[41:16] Jerusalem but now it's desolate God
[41:18] doesn't dwell there nor does do the
[41:20] people of God dwell there what a dark
[41:24] time now think about this in parallel to
[41:26] the church age is where said Christ has
[41:28] been kicked out of the church the way
[41:30] brother brandham says it one place is
[41:31] Christ has been bound by Creeds and
[41:32] dogmas for 2,000
[41:34] years the very Creeds of Babylon
[41:37] spiritual
[41:38] Babylon the voice of the bridegroom the
[41:40] voice of the Bride are no longer present
[41:44] the voice of gladness and the light of
[41:45] the candle are
[41:47] gone but in the in the sermon it is the
[41:49] rising of the Sun and he said the first
[41:52] time they'll come forth for the bride
[41:54] age another controversial phrase for a
[41:57] resurrection out of dark
[42:00] denominationalism will be a message that
[42:02] the full maturity of the word has turned
[42:04] back again in its full power and being
[42:06] waved over the People by the same signs
[42:08] and wonders that he did back there
[42:10] because I live ye live also remember how
[42:14] we read that a moment ago where brother
[42:15] BR says John 14:12 uh in the middle of
[42:18] that because I live ye live also and the
[42:19] works that I do you do also he says
[42:21] there will be a resurrection in the
[42:23] evening time it's going to be there he
[42:26] says because I live he live also
[42:28] speaking to his
[42:30] wife speaking to his wife brother
[42:32] Brandon when he's taking it uh
[42:34] Thessalonians he says and and these
[42:36] things shall be until she or the
[42:39] scripture says till he be taken out of
[42:41] the way and he says she there the bride
[42:43] when she's gone the Antichrist is able
[42:45] to take completely over H and greater
[42:48] work shall she do because I go to my
[42:51] father and he says because I live ye
[42:54] live also speaking to his wife yes right
[42:57] so it's speaking to this end time Union
[42:59] to the bride because I live ye live also
[43:02] now we could all you may not remember
[43:04] exactly what's next but once I start
[43:06] saying we could all just say it what a
[43:07] resurrection that was and what a
[43:09] resurrection this is to be quickened
[43:11] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[43:14] Jesus by quickening power he was waved
[43:17] to them the word which he was was waved
[43:19] back to them on the day of
[43:21] Pentecost now H how was it waved you can
[43:24] say the Holy Ghost poured out upon Peter
[43:26] and the the rest of the the the the
[43:28] Believers there in the upper room and
[43:29] Peter comes out preaching the word of
[43:31] God on the day of Pentecost he says the
[43:33] word made manifest now I say it's to be
[43:35] waved again in the last day so in this
[43:39] Resurrection out of dark
[43:41] denominationalism this light that comes
[43:43] it is a restoration just as Jerusalem
[43:45] was going to be built back up and just
[43:47] as Jerusalem is going to be restored and
[43:49] the temple is going to be restored and
[43:50] the presence of God is prophesied to
[43:52] come back into the house of the Lord the
[43:54] bride is going to be restored amen and
[43:56] as the voice of the bridegroom and the
[43:58] voice of the Bride were out no longer
[44:00] heard in Jerusalem the voice of the
[44:02] bridegroom in this La last hour brings
[44:05] the bride to be his body and his voice
[44:08] amen so in Jeremiah chter
[44:11] 33: 10 and 11 thus saith the Lord again
[44:16] there shall be heard in this place where
[44:18] you say shall be desolate without man
[44:20] and without Beast even in the cities of
[44:22] Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that
[44:24] are desolate without man and without
[44:25] inhabitant and without Beast the voice
[44:27] of joy and the voice of gladness the
[44:30] voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
[44:32] the bride and the voice of them that
[44:34] shall say praise the Lord of hosts for
[44:37] the Lord is
[44:39] good and this Resurrection out of dark
[44:42] denominationalism and the breaking of
[44:44] these Creeds and denominations that have
[44:46] bound you down to the place where you
[44:47] serve the the the the world there is a
[44:51] voice that calls you out of bondage
[44:53] calls you out of Babylon we've said it a
[44:55] lot lately Revelations 18:4 and now
[44:57] there is a voice of joy and a voice of
[44:59] gladness it's the voice of your beloved
[45:02] amen it's the voice of your bridegroom
[45:04] and it brings forth the voice of the
[45:08] Bride what is this voice in the end
[45:11] time it's the same voice on the day of
[45:14] Pentecost it's
[45:18] Christ brother bradam in the sermon the
[45:20] restoration of the Bride
[45:22] tree he says organizations died out now
[45:26] as he's looking at this restoration of
[45:27] the Bride Tree in April 62 he says
[45:29] Christ has again centered himself like
[45:31] the cap of a pyramid first line
[45:34] justification sanctification baptism of
[45:37] the Holy Ghost then coming of the cap
[45:39] now for those in the three
[45:41] Camp there's a
[45:44] four right so he forms himself outside
[45:47] of those stages the four life
[45:50] Messengers and again I'm not just using
[45:52] the math to all of a sudden make us lock
[45:54] up but he said the baptism of the Holy
[45:56] Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost
[45:58] himself so there's this last step he
[46:01] said must come into Perfection so every
[46:04] age has been the age of the Holy Ghost
[46:05] for the True Believer there's been
[46:06] justification sanctification baptism
[46:08] Holy Ghost but now in the end time for
[46:10] the entire thing they without us could
[46:12] not be made perfect Christ himself
[46:14] centers himself on the Capstone on
[46:16] coming of the Capstone Christ coming
[46:18] Grace Grace he reveals himself in this
[46:21] end time the seven seal brings them back
[46:23] back to Earth the book has been open
[46:24] there's a lot of things happening in
[46:26] this end time time he says what is it
[46:28] the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so
[46:30] it can fit with the same kind of
[46:32] ministry he had when he went away that
[46:35] when he comes back it'll catch the whole
[46:36] thing in the Rapture where they're
[46:38] Justified Sanctified and the baptisms of
[46:40] the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand
[46:42] again the house of God will live
[46:46] again the house of God that's been our
[46:49] theme this whole year the house of God
[46:51] shall live again God has built you up to
[46:53] be his Tabernacle to be his Temple the
[46:56] house of God is living again in you you
[46:58] are his body therefore you must be his
[47:01] hands you must be his eyes and maybe
[47:03] even more critically you are his voice
[47:05] in this end time whose sins are going to
[47:08] be remitted it it has to be there has to
[47:10] be a crying out of the atonement there
[47:13] has to be a life that's being lived that
[47:14] expresses a hope to people who are in
[47:17] darkness this house of God will live
[47:23] again I believe it's the voice of Mercy
[47:25] it's the church that's taken the place
[47:27] of Christ it's the bride that's been
[47:30] dressed in the bleeding word amen yes
[47:33] sir this is the invisible
[47:37] Union and the sermon the Feast of the
[47:40] trumpets and I'm I'm almost done here
[47:42] just making tremendous time I feel
[47:45] listen to this statement in the Feast of
[47:46] the
[47:48] trumpets I I typed these up uh myself
[47:51] and I typed the feast if the trumpets so
[47:54] I'm so glad I didn't have a slide up
[47:56] there
[47:57] brother Michael one time saw a typo in
[47:59] one of them and he thought for sure he's
[48:01] like what is brother Aaron trying to do
[48:02] here you know CU got everybody looking
[48:04] for an Easter egg there got to be some
[48:06] point in it I kind love how I have that
[48:07] Mystique about me now I just make a
[48:09] horrible mistake I'm like did you catch
[48:10] that did you catch that man that was
[48:12] pretty big man but no the feast if the
[48:17] trumpets and brother B says he said in
[48:19] the evening time the clouds will move
[48:21] away Grant it
[48:24] Lord roll back the clouds Lord the
[48:27] denominations will fade and the same
[48:31] gospel the same word made flesh and he
[48:34] says as he promised in Luke 17:30 the
[48:37] same gospel with the same thing would
[48:39] take place in the evening time just when
[48:41] the Shadows are getting low the same
[48:44] gospel the same Christ that lived in
[48:46] flesh back Yonder at the beginning on
[48:48] the Eastern people you
[48:51] listening I'm almost done shall live
[48:54] again in the western people at the end
[48:57] time amen it shall be light in the
[49:00] evening
[49:01] time the same Christ to the Eastern
[49:04] people and the same way now let me let
[49:07] me say this this has just open up a
[49:08] whole area to really really uh think
[49:12] about God who had made himself known to
[49:16] the Old
[49:17] Testament Church the
[49:20] Jews and how that God gave them physical
[49:23] signs and gave them a physical land
[49:27] and he reveals himself to the Jews as
[49:31] Christ the fleshly physical
[49:34] Messiah that was their Messiah that was
[49:37] the Capstone to their their Church
[49:39] ages and so there's a transition that
[49:41] comes and going to enter a totally
[49:43] different dispensation and it's calling
[49:45] because they were called out of a
[49:46] natural land into the promised land and
[49:48] then Christ now this culmination this
[49:50] climax he's there in the flesh as their
[49:53] Messiah and he's telling them that I'm
[49:54] going to pour out power upon you and
[49:57] you're going to come out of your sins
[49:58] and from a a sinful condition a
[50:00] spiritual condition into a spiritual
[50:02] Promised Land of the baptism of the Holy
[50:04] Ghost so what you modeled after the
[50:06] flesh I want you to do
[50:08] spiritually so when the promise comes to
[50:11] the Gentiles they have no physical
[50:13] Messiah but yet Christ is coming to the
[50:17] the Gentiles in the beginning of the
[50:19] church through the form of the baptism
[50:21] of the Holy Ghost now the Jews will see
[50:24] Christ again one day and he will reveal
[50:26] himself and how is he going to do it in
[50:29] flesh but in this end time when Christ
[50:32] is going to reveal himself to his bride
[50:35] for an invisible union he does not come
[50:37] in flesh of of as he was in in the
[50:40] Eastern people but in the Feast of the
[50:42] trumpets he says that we will know our
[50:44] mate the revealed word listen your
[50:47] bridegroom is here the promise that he
[50:50] would come is being fulfilled right now
[50:53] don't go look for him don't go wait for
[50:55] brother Brenham to come back you've got
[50:57] to find him here now revealing himself
[50:59] in
[51:00] [Music]
[51:02] Mercy same Christ he says it shall be
[51:05] light in the evening time because he
[51:07] reveals himself spiritually to the
[51:10] Gentiles oh we're going to see
[51:12] him we will see him we'll meet him in
[51:15] the air but he doesn't come back to
[51:17] earth in flesh doesn't reveal himself on
[51:19] Earth in that body until the Millennium
[51:22] and brother B said that's the coming
[51:23] everyone's looking for I believe it may
[51:25] even be in the church he says his second
[51:27] coming coming up he says in his second
[51:29] coming he's talking about when he
[51:30] reveals himself in flesh to the
[51:33] Jews because between the Son of God and
[51:36] the church ages and before he reveals
[51:38] himself as son of David in the
[51:39] Millennium when he comes back to Earth
[51:40] with his bride that third coming he
[51:42] reveals himself as the son of man to
[51:45] take his
[51:46] bride the same gospel the same word made
[51:49] flesh that lived in flesh back Yonder at
[51:52] the beginning on the Eastern people will
[51:54] live again in the western people
[51:57] at the end
[52:00] time so 2 Corinthians chap 5: 19 let's
[52:03] just read that
[52:04] verse to it that God was in
[52:07] Christ reconciling the world un
[52:10] himself not imputing their trespasses
[52:13] unto them and hath committed and I want
[52:15] to say it this way unto you the word of
[52:17] atonement amen he has you new creatures
[52:20] in Christ Jesus he has given you the
[52:21] ministry of atonement you new creatures
[52:24] in Christ Jesus he has committed to you
[52:26] the word of atonement now we might think
[52:28] okay all right I'm going to go to the
[52:30] malls during Christmas time and I'm
[52:32] going to Street preach oh it'll go viral
[52:35] I'm
[52:38] sure let it start at
[52:41] home let the ministry of atonement start
[52:44] at home let it start with those that you
[52:47] know it's it's not brother BR cautious
[52:49] don't be weird with it live the life
[52:51] live the life be sensitive find yourself
[52:53] uh uh being tuned up don't have to get a
[52:57] bullhorn and go on the corner street
[52:58] corner and just go let's just all go to
[53:00] kiern Commons uh the Friday last Friday
[53:03] before Christmas and let's just all get
[53:04] on our bullhorns pass out slot you know
[53:07] pamphlets and you know gays are going to
[53:10] hell and you know prolife this and
[53:13] screaming and ranting and yelling and
[53:14] foaming at the mouth and I guarantee you
[53:16] someone who's broken and hurting and
[53:17] wanting to find joy is going to look at
[53:19] you like that's what I've always wanted
[53:23] that he's given us the ministry and the
[53:25] word of at
[53:27] moment been focusing a lot of my studies
[53:29] on uh the Mighty God unveiled before us
[53:32] or the one that we've read the most to
[53:34] you lately is the unveiling of God and
[53:36] he says he died to reveal himself to us
[53:39] now let us die to to self to reveal him
[53:42] to
[53:42] others he died to reveal himself to us
[53:45] now let us die to self to reveal him to
[53:47] himself him to others let us die to
[53:50] traditions and things to reveal him to
[53:51] other die to denominations to reveal him
[53:55] to others
[53:56] we are to do that die to self die to
[54:00] Traditions die to denominations so that
[54:02] we can be reveal him oh I can't give
[54:06] Revelation but I can be a LIF lived I
[54:10] can be a voice I can be salty there's
[54:12] things that can be expressed through
[54:15] through our own
[54:17] lives that gives an opportunity for sins
[54:20] to be remitted amen because it's the
[54:22] life it's the token it's the life being
[54:24] lived yes
[54:26] and in message token brother B says this
[54:29] he says let me be a
[54:31] brother let me live the example of what
[54:34] Christ said a man should
[54:36] be let me be a brother to a brother a
[54:39] brother to a sister can we just all take
[54:41] this very personal right now brother
[54:43] Bram said let this be personal he's
[54:44] talking about the Greater Works well I
[54:46] know we all want to go out and create
[54:47] squirrels and we want to do greater
[54:49] things but let's just be a
[54:52] brother let's be an example of what a
[54:54] man should be
[54:57] because where are those Greater Works
[54:58] going to come from it's not going around
[55:00] saying I forgive your sins and I forgive
[55:02] your sins but it's being it's the word
[55:04] being sufficiently expressed that would
[55:07] draw somebody that they would see Christ
[55:10] being unveiled that we would reveal him
[55:12] to others his nature and his character I
[55:15] believe this will just fit so well with
[55:17] what my burden is for the next subject I
[55:18] want to explore is how how can Christ be
[55:21] accurately reflected in our lives so
[55:23] that others can see him as they need him
[55:26] yes
[55:27] and if someone is if someone is has is
[55:30] physically in pain they they want
[55:32] something to minister to that physical
[55:35] pain and there's I guess uh I guess the
[55:38] joke is is well you know I sometimes
[55:42] when of my kids or something happens and
[55:43] they say well Dad my foot hurts or my my
[55:45] knee hurts or my head hurts I said give
[55:46] me your finger
[55:48] right I'll take your mind off your knee
[55:51] I'll just make your finger hurt I like
[55:53] well that's not what I'm looking for
[55:55] says man I'm I'm I I'm really broke and
[55:57] I'm going to lose my job it's like
[55:58] here's a pie it's like well that that'll
[56:01] take care of my Hunger but that's not
[56:03] going to take care of my problem so it's
[56:05] it's kind of it's we don't want to be
[56:07] the kind of like the distraction right
[56:09] like oh man that's horrible look right
[56:11] and just try to take their mind off and
[56:13] that's what we do when we when we're
[56:15] have a baby or something like that that
[56:16] we can't get to settle down right you
[56:18] you want to distract them somehow oh
[56:20] look look at this look at that they
[56:21] start acting really really weird it's
[56:23] not going to work when somebody really
[56:25] really needs Christ we need to be the
[56:27] Christ they need in the moment where
[56:28] they're at so they can see them and know
[56:29] him like this is exactly what I needed
[56:32] am so he says let me be a brother to a
[56:34] brother a sister to a s a brother to a
[56:37] sister I love this let me be a minister
[56:39] to the
[56:41] ministers let me be an example of
[56:44] examples let me show to the world that
[56:47] this word is
[56:49] Christ the only way I can do it is to
[56:51] come into him because I can't do it
[56:53] myself you can't do it but let the word
[56:56] and you become one then it lives itself
[56:58] out you are a walking Epistle of Jesus
[57:00] Christ when he's got complete total
[57:02] control of you to make every word
[57:05] doesn't that just kind of tie into the
[57:07] church is now taking the place of Christ
[57:09] carrying on his
[57:11] ministry it's to carry on his
[57:14] work that you take the place of God
[57:17] that's exactly what it is God manifested
[57:19] in flesh just as he
[57:21] promised this is going to be personal
[57:23] that we as the bride in the last days we
[57:25] as his as his voice in whom the Holy
[57:27] Spirit dwells there's a resurrection in
[57:29] the evening
[57:31] time where this token has now brought us
[57:34] into perfect fellowship with Jesus
[57:36] Christ and the voice of God is in the
[57:38] bride the spirit and the bride say
[57:44] come and the same gospel the same Christ
[57:48] is living again in people at the end
[57:50] time because the word and you become one
[57:53] it lives itself out so he says let me be
[57:54] a brother maybe you want to say Lord let
[57:56] me be a sister let me be an example of
[57:58] what a lady should be that's why the
[58:01] Bible I mean listen I know maybe uh
[58:04] haven't dwelt a lot on it and there's uh
[58:06] some scriptures I just want to use and
[58:08] some points I was want to bring out
[58:09] brother brandom even in the token says
[58:10] you're not a
[58:12] pushover you you have character you go
[58:14] God your character is God's character
[58:16] it's not a pushover Mercy is not saying
[58:18] oh well you know what it doesn't matter
[58:19] if you cut your hair it doesn't matter
[58:20] if you you know you you you paint your
[58:22] face it doesn't matter if you are in the
[58:24] world and you do this and it's kind of
[58:25] have this what is it it's the
[58:27] sissification of society taking place in
[58:29] the gospel where everyone gets a
[58:31] participation trophy everybody wins and
[58:33] nobody
[58:35] loses and we all want to be on the the
[58:37] couch of leod DEA getting our counseling
[58:39] I need to take a half day right you know
[58:42] I need a mental health break well what
[58:44] you need a break from I is is the world
[58:47] what you need a break from is this
[58:49] dumbing down of the word of God and
[58:50] recognize the word of God teaches
[58:52] something very very plain about how a
[58:54] man's to be a man and a lady's to be a
[58:55] lady
[58:56] and if you're if you're if you're Shing
[58:58] that and making excuses there's Hellfire
[59:01] waiting for that we got to wake
[59:03] ourselves up to recognize what the word
[59:06] should look like in a lady what the word
[59:08] should look like in a
[59:09] man CU it lives itself
[59:14] out brother brandom says I'm closing on
[59:16] this Brothers you could come to your
[59:18] instruments I just I just pray that we
[59:21] can all these last few weeks we have uh
[59:23] uh together for service in the I hope we
[59:25] could just all be together and have some
[59:26] wonderful Services together coming up
[59:29] brother B says God is moving in his
[59:31] church and showed all this is in token
[59:34] we've been keeping the lamb up now for
[59:36] quite a while watching seeing what he's
[59:37] doing watching his nature and everything
[59:39] but now the token has got to be applied
[59:42] it's got to be applied it's the only
[59:45] thing except a man be born of the spirit
[59:47] and of the water he will no wise enter
[59:50] in now again I think this I want to
[59:53] hearken back to say well what about in
[59:55] other Ages were they they not born
[59:57] again I think that we don't even need to
[59:59] entertain it I mean yeah I believe they
[1:00:02] were yes absolutely were every age is
[1:00:04] the age of the Holy Ghost for the True
[1:00:05] Believer they're sealed in the body of
[1:00:06] Christ they receive the Holy Ghost well
[1:00:08] they believed in this there was an a to
[1:00:10] there was a voice there was an
[1:00:12] interceder father forgive them they
[1:00:13] don't know what they do one when there's
[1:00:16] an atonement when one is interceding
[1:00:17] when one is mediating they met the
[1:00:20] mark But The Mark of this age is
[1:00:24] perfection and you know what I might
[1:00:26] find myself finally one day saying is
[1:00:28] there time travel because I really want
[1:00:29] to go back to live in the day when God
[1:00:32] was met the mark and there was a lot of
[1:00:34] excuses for people who didn't meet the
[1:00:37] mark because we're living in an hour
[1:00:38] where it's like the full words being
[1:00:40] unveiled and I can say well I don't
[1:00:41] really think this matters and the word
[1:00:42] of God says it does well I really wish I
[1:00:44] didn't have to do this and the Bible
[1:00:45] says you better do it that's good and it
[1:00:48] starts pulling it down really really
[1:00:51] tight and I think what we have to
[1:00:53] recognize is Lord I can't do this
[1:00:56] without you live yourself out through me
[1:01:00] and accept it just believe it
[1:01:02] amen the token has got to be applied in
[1:01:05] this end time we must be born again and
[1:01:07] he says and we should love one another
[1:01:10] Believers should separate themselves
[1:01:12] from the world don't just take it now
[1:01:16] lightly you people that's listening to
[1:01:18] this on tape you women you men you just
[1:01:21] a just listen a minute I don't think I
[1:01:23] have the statement here but we were
[1:01:25] reading it the other night
[1:01:26] as a family in our devotions brother
[1:01:27] says you got to separate yourself from
[1:01:29] the foolishness of this world in the
[1:01:31] token message he's talking about it he
[1:01:33] says if you've ever believed me you
[1:01:35] believe it now it's time to quit fussing
[1:01:38] with one another believe the message of
[1:01:41] the Bible believe Jesus Christ and love
[1:01:44] and honor and respect one another men
[1:01:47] respect your wives you respect your
[1:01:50] homes bring your home together because
[1:01:52] remember this lamb was for the home not
[1:01:54] just one for the whole home had to be
[1:01:57] brought and everything had to be brought
[1:01:59] in we should love each other believers
[1:02:01] should separate themselves from the
[1:02:03] world and as he continues he said they
[1:02:05] weren't come together to talk about the
[1:02:07] token they had to come together to apply
[1:02:09] it not just sympathize with it not just
[1:02:12] identify with it it had to be applied
[1:02:16] and to think that after the seals have
[1:02:17] been preached and Christ is the mystery
[1:02:19] of God preached and he says if you've
[1:02:20] ever listened to me if you ever believed
[1:02:22] me believe me now it's time to quit
[1:02:24] fussing with one another believe the
[1:02:26] message of the Bible believe Jesus
[1:02:28] Christ love honor and respect one
[1:02:30] another he says men to wives and respect
[1:02:32] your homes bring your family together
[1:02:34] it's applying the token to your
[1:02:36] home this is the voice of
[1:02:39] Mercy why because in that Exodus if the
[1:02:41] blood wasn't applied if the token wasn't
[1:02:44] applied it was
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:02:47] death he says it's time to quit fussing
[1:02:49] with one another you know it strikes me
[1:02:51] I'm just thinking about it it seems like
[1:02:52] the world has come up with a million
[1:02:54] ways for us to be
[1:02:57] separated we're divided along lines of
[1:03:00] you know combustion engines and Electric
[1:03:03] engines and which Camp are you
[1:03:05] in and there's all sorts of ways for us
[1:03:07] to be separated whether it be political
[1:03:10] allegiances or allegiances to certain
[1:03:12] kind of food and you know there's people
[1:03:14] that can have really look down on you if
[1:03:16] you don't eat grass-fed
[1:03:18] beef you think I'm
[1:03:21] joking right they just
[1:03:23] think you're good to think that you you
[1:03:27] wait what you eat processed foods and
[1:03:30] it's almost as if you feel like you know
[1:03:32] you're you're you're condemning your
[1:03:34] family to hell because you buy Laz
[1:03:35] potato
[1:03:37] chips and and and people can be real
[1:03:39] judgmental and harsh and critical listen
[1:03:41] I I bring it up just to say this the
[1:03:43] world is finding a lot of ways to
[1:03:44] separate us put us in camps well they're
[1:03:47] this way and they're that way and then
[1:03:48] we fuss over it and people get bent out
[1:03:50] of shape and people uh do things that
[1:03:53] just divide and divide and becomes a
[1:03:54] tick in your crawl listen and it's time
[1:03:56] for us to lay aside all that foolishness
[1:03:58] all those things would divide us and
[1:04:00] come back to the thing that unites us
[1:04:02] you can remain faithful to your uh to
[1:04:04] the places you want to eat and the
[1:04:06] grass-fed beef and those who want to be
[1:04:08] vegan and those that want to do this one
[1:04:10] that's fine there's no law against those
[1:04:12] things but we better put we better come
[1:04:14] to that place of Fellowship where we all
[1:04:17] find ourselves under the protection of
[1:04:19] this
[1:04:20] blood under the
[1:04:22] token and that's what we focus on and
[1:04:25] for this this purpose so that we can be
[1:04:27] the voice of Mercy because the Greater
[1:04:29] Works the ministry of reconciliation
[1:04:32] it's all in there and it's a part of the
[1:04:34] responsibility that we have today if we
[1:04:37] could just bow our heads in a word of
[1:04:38] prayer invite you to stand together with
[1:04:40] me a gracious Heavenly Father Lord as we
[1:04:44] close this service we ask that you'd be
[1:04:47] gracious to us
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] Lord maybe it's a little chilly outside
[1:04:53] but warm in here
[1:04:56] some of the people that are missing Lord
[1:04:58] it might
[1:04:59] feel a little spread
[1:05:02] out and I realize maybe a lot of things
[1:05:06] uh visually Lord or things as far as
[1:05:14] feeling can cause our minds to wonder a
[1:05:16] little bit and Lord as i' I've
[1:05:18] challenged the people to really think
[1:05:19] about these things or chew on it and
[1:05:21] consider it there might be a lot of
[1:05:22] paradoxes a lot of misle pieces
[1:05:26] but I believe that there is a dovetail
[1:05:28] in these
[1:05:30] things if it feels like I've put a lot
[1:05:32] of pieces together that near each other
[1:05:35] that don't Bel belong in the
[1:05:37] same place Lord you just take it rightly
[1:05:40] divided in the hearts of the people as
[1:05:42] I've put it out there trusting that I've
[1:05:44] rightly divided it in Ministry Lord and
[1:05:46] I'm putting the right things out there
[1:05:48] for them to consider May the Holy Spirit
[1:05:50] take it and bring the
[1:05:52] dovetail Lord the bride is not
[1:05:56] crucified on the cross the bride is not
[1:05:58] a bleeding lamb on a Mercy
[1:06:02] Seat but Jesus said that whatever sins
[1:06:04] we remit they will be remitted any sins
[1:06:06] we retain they will be
[1:06:08] retained brother Bram told us in the
[1:06:10] scripture that when Peter stood on the
[1:06:11] day of Pentecost and preached Jesus
[1:06:13] Christ it pricked men in their hearts
[1:06:14] and they said what must we do and Peter
[1:06:17] gave the prescription to
[1:06:18] repent that was God commanding men
[1:06:21] everywhere the very ones who had
[1:06:22] crucified them calling them to Mercy to
[1:06:25] The Mercy
[1:06:26] Seat and Lord may we be the very voice
[1:06:29] of the blood crying out in this hour as
[1:06:31] vessels of Mercy starting first with our
[1:06:33] spouses with our children not be
[1:06:36] condemning not be harsh not be
[1:06:38] judgmental Lord but just cry out father
[1:06:40] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:06:42] do that Lord when we have the right
[1:06:44] opportunity we could be able to
[1:06:49] accurately accurately reflect Mercy Lord
[1:06:55] the token the challenge of the hour to
[1:06:58] get
[1:06:59] in to receive Christ to no longer linger
[1:07:02] in foolishness to straighten up
[1:07:06] Lord and may it find a heart that's
[1:07:08] willing and receptive
[1:07:10] Lord Lord we love you we commit the
[1:07:13] people to you tonight I pray that you
[1:07:14] have a Grace Upon Us physically and
[1:07:15] emotionally spiritually go with us as
[1:07:18] we're dismissed protect us Lord as we
[1:07:21] have a couple weeks yet Before Christmas
[1:07:23] may you watch out over us our decisions
[1:07:25] our
[1:07:26] finances Lord the attitudes the
[1:07:28] pressures that can be put on us Lord at
[1:07:29] the end of the year there's bonuses
[1:07:31] handed out there's people looking
[1:07:33] forward to certain things Lord may we
[1:07:34] just trust
[1:07:35] you for whatever it might be Lord just
[1:07:38] trust you watch out over us Lord protect
[1:07:41] us keep us may we find our joy May there
[1:07:44] be a voice of gladness and a voice of
[1:07:46] Joy ringing out in the streets father
[1:07:49] bless us I pray in the name of the Lord
[1:07:50] Jesus Christ amen
