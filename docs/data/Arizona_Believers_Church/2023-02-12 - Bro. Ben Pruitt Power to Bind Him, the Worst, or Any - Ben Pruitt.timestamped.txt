[0:00] I know you've heard these things before
[0:01] but just to bring back to our memories
[0:03] this morning I was thinking of a vision
[0:06] that brother Branham had and he related
[0:09] it in Paradox in December 1961
[0:12] and he says this he says it was about
[0:15] three o'clock in the morning I had
[0:16] gotten up and I looked in front of me
[0:18] looked like I was standing on the map of
[0:21] Palestine he said I was coming down to
[0:23] the Jordan and as I drew near the river
[0:26] I looked back and seen which way I had
[0:29] come and I was two-thirds of the way
[0:31] there to the Jordan I want you to notice
[0:33] this was in 1961 when he when he relates
[0:37] this and he says I looked across Jordan
[0:40] and I said oh praise God just on the
[0:43] other side is where all the promises lay
[0:47] every promise lays in the promised land
[0:50] now we know if I can just stop there for
[0:53] a moment and we'll continue on with the
[0:54] vision we know that there were three
[0:57] polls to brother branham's Ministry
[0:58] first second and third poll and so he
[1:01] finds himself two-thirds of the way to
[1:04] where he's going and he says across the
[1:07] Jordan on the other side is where the
[1:09] promises lay that that is where I'm
[1:12] going and I'm want to tell you today
[1:14] without going into it in depth but we're
[1:17] there
[1:18] we are there we are on the other side of
[1:20] the Jordan we're not looking for someone
[1:23] to come and lead us across we're not we
[1:26] are in the land where the promise is
[1:28] late he said my brother Ben this morning
[1:29] I'm still battling I I'm still
[1:32] struggling I've still got issues in my
[1:34] life that that need to be taken care of
[1:36] but the promised land was not a place of
[1:38] no struggle it was not a place in fact
[1:40] that's the place where the battle began
[1:43] in Heavenly places brother Branham calls
[1:45] it another Ephesians if you are familiar
[1:48] with that and also I believe it was in
[1:50] Paradox he deals with the with the idea
[1:52] of another Ephesians that there would be
[1:55] uh not not another Corinthians or
[1:58] another another Pentecostal move but
[2:00] there would be another uh Ephesians
[2:03] another another group of Believers a new
[2:06] group of Believers that would come up
[2:08] and they would actually have crossed
[2:10] over into the promised land and the Holy
[2:13] Spirit Joshua would be leading them and
[2:15] placing them in the word in that promise
[2:18] land that is where we are this morning
[2:20] and the great thing about that is if
[2:23] you're in that Promised Land This is
[2:25] where all the opportunities are this is
[2:28] where all the possibilities are this is
[2:30] where God has placed every door he's
[2:33] unlocked it and we'll talk about that
[2:34] some more this morning but every door
[2:36] that we go to is unlocked everything
[2:39] that we if you have a desire to overcome
[2:41] today you can overcome and if you have a
[2:44] strength in your life something that you
[2:46] need from God you can obtain it today if
[2:49] you in the promised land there's a
[2:51] battle there but there's Victory there
[2:54] that's where we're at I think sometimes
[2:57] we understand where we are and the
[3:00] message that's come to us in our day
[3:02] what it means to us you and some people
[3:04] it's like well we're just waiting I
[3:06] don't want to be critical this morning
[3:07] but people are waiting on well the next
[3:09] Pastor or or the next evangelist that's
[3:12] going to come by or some other Prophet
[3:14] or some other thing that's going to come
[3:16] we have the open book we have the word
[3:19] right here in front of us let's walk
[3:21] into it
[3:22] let's make Footsteps in it and and in
[3:25] there all things are possible
[3:28] so he said oh praise God just on the
[3:31] other side is where all the promises lay
[3:35] so keep that in your mind now as we go
[3:37] along
[3:38] so now he says then when I come into the
[3:41] vision again it seemed that I was lifted
[3:43] up and sitting on a narrow Highway with
[3:47] some brother he said I never knew who
[3:49] the brother was I looked around and
[3:51] seemed like everybody was afraid now
[3:53] we've known what that's like
[3:55] I didn't know what fear was until covet
[3:58] happened
[4:00] and everybody was afraid I'll be honest
[4:03] with you I was afraid what are we going
[4:04] to do we I began pastoring a church and
[4:07] but Aaron knows what that's like and
[4:08] just starting out and again pastoring a
[4:11] church and immediately coveted hit
[4:14] and so we had to close down and
[4:16] everybody had a different idea about
[4:17] what to do and it seemed like churches
[4:19] would just split in half and stuff we
[4:21] looked back at it now and the fear is
[4:23] mostly gone but the covet is still
[4:24] around but but a lot of a lot of the
[4:26] fear is gone but but what was everybody
[4:28] so afraid of and you begin to realize
[4:30] that was some people's worst fear was
[4:32] being caught in a group of people and
[4:34] and it was always my worst fear but you
[4:37] know but that's just that's just the way
[4:39] people were at being around people and
[4:42] and things like that and you never I
[4:44] never experienced such fear but now it
[4:47] seems like it's just getting worse and
[4:48] worse everybody's afraid of something
[4:51] it's not just covered but it seems like
[4:54] a nuclear war or Chinese balloons or
[4:57] whatever it is that's currently floating
[4:59] in the atmosphere they've probably been
[5:00] up there for years
[5:02] they just hadn't noticed them yet but
[5:04] but everybody's afraid what's going to
[5:06] happen nuclear war I'll tell you what's
[5:08] going to happen to the bride one of
[5:11] these days we're going to walk into our
[5:13] new body
[5:14] one of the hey man one of these days
[5:16] there's going to be a people who we will
[5:18] not all sleep but we will all be changed
[5:20] in the moment of twinkling of an eye so
[5:23] what's everybody so afraid of
[5:26] and we might ask ourselves that question
[5:28] and as we're going through this Vision
[5:30] now there's something that you are
[5:33] afraid of like would be the worst thing
[5:35] that you could face
[5:37] and that something is maybe different
[5:39] than what it would be for me
[5:42] right there's something that's the worst
[5:44] possibility that you begin to think
[5:46] about and you think well I I don't know
[5:49] that I could handle that maybe it's a
[5:51] it's a marriage problem maybe it's a a
[5:54] personal issue in your own in your own
[5:57] body in your own flesh in your own mind
[5:59] and you think what would I do if
[6:01] presented with that situation
[6:04] and so hold that in your mind now as we
[6:06] go in through this Vision he said a
[6:08] voice came and said there's such danger
[6:11] in these days there's a great hideous
[6:14] thing that's death when it strikes you
[6:17] and I heard the weeds mashing down and I
[6:20] looked and here come A huge monster
[6:22] snake crawling through the woods excuse
[6:24] me for shouting at you I just have to
[6:26] preach the only way I know how
[6:28] you just have to deal with the backup
[6:30] this morning I'm sorry
[6:31] I apologize for brother Aaron
[6:34] and then he builds me up before I come
[6:36] up what a mess
[6:39] but he said I
[6:46] I thought knowing this is Vision I shall
[6:47] see what this animal or this Beast is
[6:50] and he crawled up on the highway and as
[6:52] soon as I got sight of him I knew it was
[6:54] a man Bob and he said Amanda is an
[6:57] African snake which is the most deadly
[6:59] bite of all things there is there's
[7:01] nothing as poison as a man but in the
[7:03] snake of course represents sin and death
[7:06] now
[7:08] I'll be honest with you all right we
[7:09] were in Sabino the other day we've been
[7:11] in Tucson and and just walking around I
[7:14] know the snakes aren't out yet but just
[7:16] walking around everything that rustles I
[7:18] look at it
[7:20] because I can't stand snakes and you can
[7:23] only run so fast when you're up on those
[7:25] trails and believe it or not I did get
[7:27] up there and and uh and made it down and
[7:30] it may be the only most exercise I've
[7:31] had in years and but we walked up up on
[7:34] top of the mountain there and as we were
[7:37] going along those Trails the uh the dead
[7:39] brush sometimes will rustle and and you
[7:41] look at and think my goodness what's in
[7:43] those what's in those holes what's in
[7:45] those rocks and I think it might be a
[7:47] snake and and yet the Mamba made one of
[7:50] those snakes maybe uh would be just
[7:52] minor compared to the bite of the
[7:54] African Mamba he said it's the most
[7:56] deadly bite of all things there is
[7:58] there's nothing as poison as a mom and
[8:00] the snake of course represents sin and
[8:02] death he said and here he was on the
[8:04] highway I thought well this is it so I
[8:07] looked at him and he looked angry at me
[8:09] and he licked his tongue and here he
[8:11] comes and that would be the moment there
[8:13] I went
[8:16] he said here he come he said and when he
[8:18] got right close to me he would run up
[8:21] fast and then he would get slower and
[8:24] slower
[8:25] and just quiver and stop and then
[8:27] something would hold him off
[8:29] he couldn't bite me
[8:31] you realize you can't leave here until
[8:34] until God allows it
[8:36] he said he has appointed bounds that we
[8:39] cannot pass
[8:40] quit living your life in fear and dread
[8:43] at the next moment or the the car wreck
[8:45] or something I know we go through
[8:46] traumatic things and sometimes we live
[8:48] in in fear that happening again but you
[8:51] can't live like that let God be God he
[8:54] can't take you till it's time
[8:56] and so now he said he looked angry I
[8:59] mean he got right up close to me but he
[9:01] gets slower and slower something would
[9:02] hold him off he couldn't bite me and he
[9:05] would turn around on the other side and
[9:06] try to approach from this side and he
[9:08] would get back and get a start and swish
[9:10] right towards me get slower and slower
[9:12] and slower then to a stop and then he
[9:14] would shake like that and move back he
[9:15] couldn't strike me then he turned and
[9:18] looked to my friend and away he went
[9:19] after my friend and I see my friend just
[9:21] jumping way in the air well that'd be me
[9:23] I tell you what I'm not trying to place
[9:25] myself in the vision but I'd have been
[9:26] jumping he said over him and over him
[9:29] and over him trying and the thing was
[9:31] striking at him I thought oh if it ever
[9:32] hits him it'll be instant death no
[9:34] wonder everybody is so scared and I
[9:36] threw my hands up and I said oh God have
[9:38] mercy on my brother
[9:40] and just then the serpent turned to me
[9:42] when I said that and looked at me again
[9:44] and a voice came from above me and said
[9:47] you've been given power to bind him
[9:50] I watch him the worst
[9:53] or any
[9:56] him the worst or any
[10:00] and I said well God what must I do
[10:03] he says there's one thing you must do
[10:06] you must be more sincere
[10:09] I said well God forgive me for my
[10:11] insincerity
[10:13] let me have sincerity
[10:15] if he wasn't sincere I
[10:17] I don't know I don't know if I even have
[10:19] a chance at being called sincere
[10:21] a prophet was a sincere worshiper a
[10:24] sincere preacher and yet the angel told
[10:26] him you must be more sincere
[10:28] more sincere so there must be something
[10:30] about this sincerity it's not just the
[10:33] way that we approach maybe our scripture
[10:35] the Bible or the way we treat people but
[10:37] there's a sincerity towards the word
[10:40] and a seriousness that comes with this
[10:42] now he said there was when I raised my
[10:45] hands up to him again there was a great
[10:47] something came over me just lifted me up
[10:49] seemed like that my whole body was
[10:51] charged with something and I looked at
[10:53] the serpent he started towards me and he
[10:55] couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in
[10:58] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind
[11:00] you and the serpent blew smoke flew out
[11:03] of me curled up and made the sign he
[11:04] said like a capital S made backwards I
[11:07] can't make a capital S backwards
[11:09] he said I am the fact
[11:11] he said and means buying this one
[11:15] I love it buying this one or anything
[11:19] below him
[11:22] because it's actually a very simple
[11:24] thought today May kind of entered in on
[11:26] the deep end but
[11:27] buying this one or anything below him
[11:31] because he was the worst
[11:34] now watch
[11:36] now remember you're scared of something
[11:38] or something in your life maybe that you
[11:40] struggle with or something I know people
[11:41] are people and I've found everywhere I
[11:43] go that people deal with it may be a
[11:45] different area different people about
[11:47] different backgrounds but you deal with
[11:49] certain things it's the culture of the
[11:51] world that we live in it's the nature of
[11:52] the flesh bodies that we're in and
[11:54] there's something that you'd have to
[11:56] deal with something that oh if that
[11:57] happens I don't know what I would do I
[11:59] don't know but I'm here to tell you
[12:01] there is nothing that can stand before
[12:03] you all the days of your life you've
[12:05] come you're across the Jordan you're
[12:07] living in that land you're living in the
[12:09] land of possibility you're living in the
[12:11] land of the open book and so there's
[12:13] something that has come to us this age
[12:15] we can realize that we can recognize
[12:16] this is who I am this is I'm not because
[12:19] that's the great fight it seems like
[12:21] that it's who are we going to be what
[12:24] are we going to be as a bride what well
[12:25] what are we supposed to be well we can
[12:27] be everything the word says we could be
[12:30] there could be people that go to church
[12:32] today and love one another and care
[12:34] about one another and just have a church
[12:36] why because the word says we could
[12:39] there will be ministers many may fall
[12:42] most might fall or get off the word but
[12:45] there will be somebody with Aaron
[12:47] somebody that'll stand for the truth
[12:50] somebody's going to make it
[12:52] that might as well be me
[12:54] somebody's going to make it
[12:57] and so we're living in that time so he
[12:59] said buying this one or anything below
[13:00] him because he was the worst blue smoke
[13:02] fell out of him his tail choked his own
[13:04] self to death around his head he said
[13:06] and the brother was free
[13:08] and just in a voice oh my so not just
[13:10] brother Branham but the brother was free
[13:13] and just then a voice came again and
[13:15] said you can unbind him also so I said
[13:17] then Satan that I might know I unbind
[13:19] you when it did he started coming to
[13:20] life again wiggling and I said I bind
[13:22] you back in the name of Jesus Christ and
[13:24] when it did the smoke flew out of him
[13:26] again he choked himself right back again
[13:27] turned to Crystal and then when he did
[13:30] that that voice said now you must be
[13:32] more sincere than what you are to do
[13:35] this then it left me and I was standing
[13:38] in the room number the random continues
[13:40] to preach on a paradox and what it was
[13:42] incredible but true and then later in
[13:44] that message he ties the vision too our
[13:46] text that we read Matthew 16 19 he just
[13:49] says something to the effect of uh that
[13:51] reminds me of that vision
[13:53] so Jesus Jesus says that again in
[13:56] Matthew 18 18 he doesn't just limit that
[13:58] to the to Peter as the Catholic Church
[14:02] would have us believe but he said verily
[14:03] I say unto you
[14:05] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth
[14:08] shall be bound in heaven
[14:10] whatever you bind on Earth
[14:13] whatever you loose on Earth should be
[14:15] loosed in heaven
[14:17] again I say unto you that if two of you
[14:20] that's powerful
[14:22] two of you way more than two here this
[14:24] morning
[14:26] two of you shall agree on Earth think
[14:28] about that in the context of a marriage
[14:29] as well
[14:31] if two of you
[14:33] can get come in agreement
[14:35] that's touching anything
[14:37] that they shall ask it should be done
[14:39] for them of My Father which is in heaven
[14:41] just two of you can come together
[14:43] and there's that power for where two or
[14:46] three are gathered together in my name
[14:48] there am I in the midst of them and that
[14:50] means more than just feeling his
[14:52] presence although we do aren't you
[14:54] grateful we can feel his presence and we
[14:56] can we can sense that he's here brother
[14:57] said a man this born of God can feel the
[15:00] presence of God since the presence of
[15:01] God know that he's here but yet we we
[15:03] realize that that's not all there is to
[15:05] it where he is anything is possible
[15:09] huh
[15:10] you see why it's so important that the
[15:13] word would be open in our day and
[15:14] unveiled in our age so that it would be
[15:16] completely open not not just part of it
[15:19] because now anything is possible because
[15:21] this is the age where we have to take a
[15:23] rapture
[15:24] right so now we find that the scripture
[15:27] was was manifested quite literally in
[15:29] the upper room where they were in one
[15:31] Accord in one place if two of you agree
[15:32] on any one thing they become in one
[15:34] Accord in one place and the Holy Spirit
[15:36] fell and Peter took the keys from his
[15:38] side right he'd been given the keys
[15:40] remember and he took the keys from his
[15:42] side and he began to he began to uh man
[15:46] I didn't start my timer you all may be
[15:48] in trouble
[15:51] I'm not long-winded I I'm a Pruitt not a
[15:54] McGary
[15:59] foreign
[16:01] it's called irony
[16:04] I'm not good at picking up irony we have
[16:06] a long history with that so
[16:08] now
[16:10] this was manifesting the upper room he
[16:12] said Peter took the keys from his side
[16:14] opened the mystery of Salvation now it
[16:17] says when they heard this they were
[16:18] pricked in their heart said to Peter and
[16:19] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[16:21] Brethren what shall we do Peter said to
[16:22] them repent and be baptized every one of
[16:25] you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[16:26] their mission of sins and you shall
[16:27] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[16:30] now they said men and Brethren what can
[16:32] we do that's the question this is
[16:33] Brother Branham now how are we going to
[16:35] get to it get it who's got the keys come
[16:38] here Simon
[16:40] you got the keys now watch he's using
[16:42] this this this power to loose
[16:45] you've got the keys pull them off your
[16:47] side what are you going to say
[16:50] he said now remember Jesus Christ said
[16:53] if you bind it on Earth I'll bind it in
[16:54] heaven if you loosed it on Earth all
[16:56] Lucid in heaven and if he's God he has
[16:59] to keep his word
[17:01] oh I love this and he talks about the
[17:04] Catholic priests that Catholic priest
[17:06] come to him and said God is in his
[17:07] church but the random counters God is in
[17:08] his word and he goes on and he said then
[17:10] didn't Christ give his church the
[17:12] Catholic priest said didn't Christ give
[17:13] his church which we are his church the
[17:15] power to forgive sins on Earth he said
[17:17] he certainly did I said now if you'll
[17:19] forgive them the same way that they
[17:20] forgive them I'll go with you he said I
[17:23] said how'd they forgive them did they
[17:24] tell him go do a novena or something the
[17:26] way you do he said no sir Peter said
[17:28] repent there's the key
[17:31] so the key to unlock was in Peter
[17:33] speaking the word
[17:35] and when he spoke that word in due
[17:38] season
[17:39] right and the word for that hour the
[17:41] word of the hour it was the key that
[17:43] unlocked to them that what had been a
[17:46] mystery the mystery is the lock and the
[17:49] Revelation is the key and he said then
[17:51] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[17:53] Ghost the key went click
[17:55] on Earth
[17:56] and went click
[17:58] in heaven
[18:01] and a dispensation was unlocked
[18:06] foreign
[18:07] just the power of the word if we
[18:09] recognize that we wouldn't want to ever
[18:11] miss church
[18:13] we wouldn't want to ever miss our prayer
[18:15] time our study time because you realize
[18:17] the power of that word that when the
[18:19] season comes the right time is there and
[18:21] you're standing there under the
[18:23] anointing of that word you you speak it
[18:25] and it unlocks
[18:29] now watch
[18:31] the key went click on earth when click
[18:32] in heaven he said I'll give unto you the
[18:33] Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatever
[18:35] you bind on Earth shall be abound in
[18:36] heaven whatever you loose under shall be
[18:38] loosed in heaven notice he said Keys
[18:40] plural these keys were given to Peter
[18:42] and by extension to the church now watch
[18:43] God does nothing without man how many
[18:45] believe that today
[18:46] brother Brandon said he could have chose
[18:48] the Sun the moon the wind and I'm
[18:50] leaving out a lot of quotes here just to
[18:51] kind of move us along but brother
[18:53] Branham taught us that now he does
[18:55] nothing without a man and what that
[18:57] tells me is not only that they're still
[18:58] preachers today Ministry but that
[19:00] there's people
[19:02] right there's got to be people that
[19:03] speak the word of God
[19:05] there's got to be people that take
[19:07] responsibility for the word that they've
[19:09] been given in our day
[19:11] so now he says for Peter was given the
[19:13] key to the kingdom saying whatever you
[19:15] bind on Earth I'll bind it in heaven
[19:16] what does the key do it unlocks
[19:18] something the mystery and when Jesus
[19:21] said go baptize them in the name of the
[19:23] father Son and Holy Ghost sitting there
[19:24] to Blind the unbelievers so now watch he
[19:28] actually spoke something in mystery form
[19:30] and said his father son of the Holy
[19:32] Ghost and then Peter takes the key and
[19:35] unlocks it and says that's the name or
[19:37] Jesus of Jesus Christ baptize them in
[19:39] the name of Jesus Christ it is the name
[19:40] of the father Son and Holy Ghost of the
[19:42] Lord Jesus Christ now there were mystery
[19:46] it was a mystery that was unlocked but
[19:47] we know there were some things that were
[19:49] left and just kind of catching us up to
[19:51] speed but you all know what I'm talking
[19:53] about some mystery is not yet unfolded
[19:55] in that time and so you can say well in
[19:57] Luther's day it was a key it was given
[19:59] to unlock justification and in Wesley
[20:02] and and Pentecost and in different ages
[20:04] they had a certain key to be able to
[20:06] unlock a certain portion but the Bible
[20:09] tells us in the days of the voice of the
[20:11] seven Angel when he shall begin to sound
[20:14] the mystery of God should be finished
[20:18] so now are you with me you're you're
[20:20] across Jordan
[20:21] you're in the land where all the
[20:23] promises are
[20:25] and you've walked into this say like a
[20:27] supermarket I don't know about you I I
[20:28] like your steak and I I like a Prime
[20:31] Steak I can't always afford a prime
[20:33] mistake but I like a prime mistake and
[20:36] when I can get one on sale I I'll buy
[20:38] one and and I like a Prime Steak if I'm
[20:40] going to eat steak I want something
[20:42] that's good
[20:43] and you can go into a grocery store and
[20:45] get all kinds of things and you know it
[20:47] seems like that some people you just
[20:49] bear with me this morning I feel relaxed
[20:51] and comfortable this morning but as we
[20:53] if you go into a supermarket and you
[20:56] just begin to pick things off the shelf
[20:57] it seems like that some people take the
[20:59] message and just begin to pick the
[21:01] lowest things off the lowest shelves
[21:03] it's not that it's not good or that you
[21:05] couldn't feed off of it but there's got
[21:07] to be some somebody going in there and
[21:09] getting some steak
[21:10] right that's the word of the hour plus
[21:13] and fight about a lot of things you can
[21:14] go in there and and pull some things off
[21:16] of the off of the fast food aisle or the
[21:18] dessert aisle and that's good but you
[21:20] can't live there there's got to be a
[21:22] point in which you go in and get
[21:23] something if you've got it all in front
[21:25] of you and we do
[21:27] why not go and get the good things
[21:30] right and there's some that go in and
[21:32] they tried to they tried to use it to
[21:34] shore up their position or build a
[21:36] kingdom but let me go into the room let
[21:39] me go in where all the promises lay let
[21:41] me go into the supermarket where where
[21:43] the prime beef is let me go in and take
[21:46] what what is really mine let me go in
[21:48] and take advantage of the good stuff
[21:51] that's there
[21:53] huh we could spend all of our
[22:04] again you you have a choice what you
[22:06] again we're in there we're there the
[22:09] prophet has brought us there we're there
[22:10] by the opening of the word by the new
[22:12] birth also sets us in the holy ghost
[22:14] sets us in Heavenly places in Christ so
[22:17] you can't be there you could understand
[22:18] God sent a prophet and not be there
[22:20] because you're not born again
[22:22] but when you come into the land when
[22:24] you're born again you're seated in
[22:25] Heavenly places in Christ now you're
[22:26] fighting a spiritual battle
[22:28] spiritual warfare Heavenly places is
[22:30] high places
[22:31] and and it's in that spiritual warfare
[22:34] that spiritual realm is where a battle
[22:36] is being fought and in that spiritual
[22:38] realm you have an opportunity you you
[22:40] can fight you can keep going you can be
[22:42] more sincere
[22:44] or you can be less
[22:46] right we might as well be more sincere
[22:49] if we're going to have church we might
[22:51] as well have church
[22:52] if we're going to live for God we might
[22:54] as well surrender all to him as brother
[22:56] Aaron already said we might as well give
[22:58] him everything why hold back a tenth why
[23:01] hold back a part why not give him
[23:03] everything I promised in my life let me
[23:06] give him all of my life let me live like
[23:09] a Christian should I'm in the word I'm
[23:11] in the land let me take advantage of
[23:13] that you say brother Ben I just can't do
[23:15] it you don't realize where you are and
[23:16] who you are
[23:19] okay
[23:21] so we find in the mystery of God would
[23:24] be finished as he has declared to his
[23:25] servants the prophets now
[23:27] so there was something that was unlocked
[23:29] in our day
[23:31] which was the hidden Mystery of the
[23:32] entire Bible
[23:34] right the whole book become a new book
[23:37] that's not just a part of certain things
[23:39] in the scriptures but it's all of it
[23:41] and we find within that is death itself
[23:46] right there has to be the mystery of the
[23:49] Rapture is in that
[23:51] so the Bible tells us in First
[23:53] Corinthians 15 25 that Christ must Reign
[23:56] until he put all enemies under his feet
[23:58] but The Last Enemy that shall be
[24:00] destroyed is death
[24:03] right there's going to be a people that
[24:04] walk into that
[24:06] oh my now again Jesus already he took
[24:10] the keys of death and hell away from
[24:13] away from the Satan right he kicked him
[24:16] back down into hell he he was the mighty
[24:19] conqueror but we find now it's got to
[24:22] come a finishing to that in our age when
[24:24] finally death itself is walked over
[24:28] right you've got to walk into that and
[24:30] so in verse 51 he said behold I show you
[24:32] a mystery
[24:33] here's a lock here's something here we
[24:36] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[24:38] changed
[24:40] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[24:42] at the last Trump
[24:44] for the trumpets of sound and the dead
[24:46] shall be raised Incorruptible and we
[24:49] shall be changed
[24:52] in a moment
[24:54] now I want to elevate our thoughts this
[24:56] morning you say brother Ben I'm going
[24:57] through something at home I'm struggling
[25:00] with my schoolwork I'm struggling at my
[25:03] job I'm struggling with some disease or
[25:05] something in the body but I want to
[25:07] elevate your thoughts for just a moment
[25:09] because if death is bound if death is
[25:13] destroyed
[25:15] then everything under death
[25:18] is also destroyed
[25:21] are you with me now
[25:23] seeing in the garden we don't have time
[25:25] to go into it this morning but it caused
[25:27] death
[25:28] and the only way to come out from that
[25:30] sin is to be born again you you can't
[25:33] work your way to the New Birth either
[25:34] you've got to be born again and it's the
[25:37] it's the grace of God The Sovereign
[25:39] Grace of God
[25:41] you couldn't compel yourself to be where
[25:44] you are you are compelled by grace
[25:46] to be who you are
[25:48] I think of the woman at the well and how
[25:50] brother Brandon said she had
[25:51] representation in heaven do you realize
[25:53] God moved centuries of time moved
[25:57] prophets to put her where she was
[26:00] I was preaching on Jonah here not long
[26:02] ago and just a little diversion and
[26:04] we'll get back into what we're talking
[26:05] about but I was preaching on Jonah here
[26:08] a while ago and I realized something
[26:10] Jonah had to go to Nineveh because if
[26:13] Nineveh had been destroyed
[26:16] then they would not have ever invaded
[26:18] Israel
[26:20] because later on they invaded Israel
[26:22] which didn't make sense to Jonah I'm
[26:24] sure why am I going to save a nation
[26:27] that's going to actually destroy us
[26:30] because there were prophecies about
[26:31] Nineveh that had been spoken that that
[26:34] they would come and destroy Israel so
[26:37] why go save a nation
[26:39] it's going to destroy you
[26:41] knowing they would do it so they
[26:42] repented they were not destroyed right
[26:44] away
[26:45] and they come back and they just they
[26:47] come in and and took over Israel and
[26:49] what they did when they come in is they
[26:51] actually settled parts of it they moved
[26:53] out some of the Israelites out of the
[26:55] area that was known as Samaria and they
[26:57] actually settled that part of Israel and
[27:00] it was those people that come in there
[27:02] you find it in First Kings where it
[27:04] talks about how they come in and they
[27:05] tried to live under the gods of their
[27:07] nation and it wasn't strong enough so
[27:08] they sent back and and the king of
[27:10] Assyria actually sent back in to that
[27:13] nation and sent made them cause teachers
[27:16] to come in and teach them the Jewish
[27:17] religion they ended up being the
[27:19] Samaritans
[27:20] now think about it for just a moment
[27:23] if Jonah had not done what he did read
[27:25] from God
[27:27] and ended up in a whale's belly and come
[27:30] out of the well so they would believe
[27:32] the Samaritans would have never been
[27:34] there
[27:36] because Nineveh would have been
[27:37] destroyed
[27:42] and hundreds of years later
[27:45] oh God you think God don't care about
[27:47] you
[27:49] because you've been through something
[27:51] you think God don't care
[27:53] he just look at my life it's messed up
[27:56] her life was messed up
[27:58] she'd had five husbands the one she was
[28:00] living with was not hers
[28:01] and she's there and she's wondering what
[28:03] am I doing in life what is the point
[28:06] maybe she thought about taking her own
[28:08] life
[28:09] and she's sitting there one day going
[28:11] through the daily routine she goes to
[28:13] the well not knowing that that was a
[28:15] moment that God had prepared for
[28:17] thousands of years because she was in
[28:20] his mind and he moved Kings
[28:23] and move profits so that she would be
[28:26] born
[28:32] you think you don't care less about you
[28:35] a woman who had messed up all of her
[28:37] life messed up everything
[28:38] and yet she comes to that point I don't
[28:40] even know why I'm dealing with this this
[28:41] morning it's not in my notes but she's
[28:43] done everything that she could do and
[28:44] she just messed up everything she gets
[28:46] to the well that morning and here's
[28:47] Christ he said I must I must needs go by
[28:49] Samaria and it was a supernatural moment
[28:52] and appointed time or you you know what
[28:55] that time is like you were there one day
[28:57] and he'd come by your way that wasn't in
[28:59] the effort that you did
[29:00] that was God come by your way and you
[29:03] don't know how many mountains he's moved
[29:05] so you could be here this morning so
[29:07] that you could sit here under the word
[29:09] and have a faithful pastor and live for
[29:11] God with all of your heart that's why he
[29:13] let you go through what you went through
[29:15] so that he could remake the clay the way
[29:17] he wanted it to be
[29:22] you don't care any less about you than
[29:24] he did about her what was it she had
[29:25] representation in heaven so do you
[29:29] and so he's moving mountains today a
[29:31] prophet didn't come for himself he said
[29:33] behold I send you Elijah
[29:36] huh
[29:40] let's go back to our our thought now and
[29:42] think about that he cares about you he
[29:44] puts you here for a reason
[29:46] and now he's destroying death for you
[29:49] he said we shall not all sleep we should
[29:50] all be changed in a moment in a
[29:51] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[29:53] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[29:55] should be raised Incorruptible we shall
[29:57] be changed verse 53 for this corruptible
[30:00] must put on incorruption this Mortal
[30:02] must put on immortality
[30:04] so in this corruptable shall it put on
[30:06] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[30:08] put on immortality then shall be brought
[30:10] to pass the saying that is written death
[30:12] is swallowed up in Victory
[30:14] then if we believe the seventh Angels
[30:16] come and the Mysteries have been
[30:17] finished
[30:19] then the door
[30:20] to the Rapture was open to us
[30:25] and you go into the Rapture and it
[30:27] begins to bring it down he says the the
[30:28] shout was a message
[30:31] it wasn't what we thought but the door's
[30:33] been open
[30:35] and when the time is right we'll walk
[30:37] right into it you said what I'm worried
[30:39] I won't make it don't be afraid
[30:41] it's been destroyed get into the land
[30:44] get into the word believe the word with
[30:46] all of your heart
[30:48] huh
[30:50] Let It Be Your Life Death has been
[30:52] swallowed up in Victory
[30:54] right and we know the he said well my
[30:56] body starts death in and it will till
[30:57] that moment comes
[31:00] right but it's already it's already set
[31:03] in motion
[31:04] you're on if you went out here to a
[31:07] theme park somewhere and got on a roller
[31:09] coaster at some point you can't get off
[31:13] or you shouldn't
[31:16] right you've been strapped in and the
[31:18] warning lights have went off and you're
[31:20] already it's starting in that direction
[31:22] no it's not finished yet but you're on
[31:24] the ride listen Church we're not done
[31:26] yet there's still some there's still
[31:28] some ride left to go there may be some
[31:30] loops and turns and twists but we're on
[31:32] the ride this morning
[31:34] the route to The Rapture has been set in
[31:36] motion we can't get off don't let Satan
[31:39] beat you up and tell you I'm not going
[31:40] to make it I'm not good enough he called
[31:42] you here for a reason
[31:49] I have to settle down my Arkansas ways
[31:52] out here in Phoenix
[31:55] it just means so much to me
[31:57] because I know what I come out of
[32:00] right to be a believer
[32:03] I know what I've come through I know my
[32:06] family's trained and if death has been
[32:09] defeated everything under death
[32:12] all the family strains all the complexes
[32:15] all the worry all the anxiety it's all
[32:18] gone
[32:19] all I got to do is walk into that door
[32:24] brother Brandon said to the church the
[32:26] bride the Rapture is a revelation to her
[32:28] it's revealed to her that the Revelation
[32:31] the true bride of Christ will be waiting
[32:33] for that revelation of the Rapture he
[32:35] said no it is the Revelation for the
[32:36] Revelation is Faith you cannot have a
[32:39] revelation without it being faith faith
[32:40] is a revelation because it's something
[32:42] that's revealed to you faith is a
[32:44] revelation faith is something that's
[32:46] been revealed to you like it was to
[32:47] Abraham that could call anything
[32:49] contrary to what had been revealed to
[32:51] him as though it wasn't so
[32:53] right now Faith that's what faith is is
[32:55] the revelation of God the church is
[32:57] built upon a revelation he said the
[32:59] whole entire body
[33:01] amen he said I believe that through
[33:03] those I was in the Rapture sermon he
[33:05] said I believe that through those seven
[33:06] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[33:07] days in order to get the bride together
[33:09] for rapturing faith
[33:11] because what we got right now we
[33:12] wouldn't be able to do it he said there
[33:14] is something we've got to step further
[33:15] now remember this is in the first seal
[33:17] he said we've got to step further we
[33:18] can't have enough faith for Divine
[33:20] Healing hardly we've got to have enough
[33:21] Faith to be changed in a moment be swept
[33:23] out of this Earthly saying something's
[33:24] coming something's coming something's
[33:26] coming and then he goes back and I don't
[33:29] have time you all know the quotes that
[33:30] many of you do and and we can go back
[33:33] and and bring out how he said it was
[33:35] prophecy now it's history and it was a
[33:38] it was a prophecy of something coming
[33:40] now it's a history of something that has
[33:42] come and now he comes up and he says
[33:44] they asked him they said will there be
[33:46] some great Revelation that'll give us
[33:48] give us Faith that'll give us more faith
[33:51] to operate gifts and things he said no
[33:53] it's not like that he says it this way
[33:55] he said it's all revealed in there and
[33:57] the Seven Seals opened up the revelation
[33:59] of what that was
[34:00] that's what it was see he said it's
[34:02] still in the word those Thunders won't
[34:03] be something out here somewhere some
[34:05] esoteric idea that somebody has listen
[34:08] if somebody tells you oh I know what the
[34:09] seven Thunders are and I'm the only one
[34:11] that knows it
[34:12] listen God didn't give them the key
[34:14] alone
[34:16] right he gave it to the bride
[34:19] it's been revealed it's right there
[34:22] and and he says it'll be the word it
[34:25] won't leave the word and God's spirit
[34:26] will never leave that word it'll stay
[34:27] right with the word blinding some and
[34:29] Open the Eyes of others it'll always
[34:31] do that are you still with me this
[34:33] morning
[34:35] now
[34:36] so the Mysteries have been revealed now
[34:38] I know I'm keep backing up but we just
[34:40] we need to catch this I needed to catch
[34:42] this
[34:44] the Mysteries have been revealed the
[34:46] mystery is the lock the Revelation is
[34:48] the key and we have it
[34:52] all right
[34:54] so now again we come down to
[34:57] everything that we're going through
[34:58] everything under death
[35:01] and and this message will be is what is
[35:05] transporting us
[35:07] into the kingdom of life
[35:10] right into eternal life it's already
[35:13] within us then if that's the case if the
[35:17] Mamba has been spoken to and destroyed
[35:21] right if the promised land is all around
[35:23] us
[35:24] what about those little things that
[35:26] we're afraid of
[35:27] what about that you see but brother Ben
[35:29] I I still have that it's very real
[35:32] and it will be very real because you
[35:35] still live in a flesh body there's so
[35:38] many things about you don't ever forget
[35:39] that church the moment you get arrogant
[35:42] is the moment you fall
[35:44] and I've realized but Aaron we're not
[35:46] better than other men we're the same as
[35:48] other men Paul said this oh this
[35:50] wretched body that I have this flesh
[35:52] that I have we're no different it takes
[35:54] something to dominate that it takes the
[35:56] holy spirit in your life that can take
[35:58] charge of that but that's why we have to
[36:00] stay in church
[36:02] that's why we have to stay in the word
[36:04] that's why we have to read our Bible
[36:05] that's why we have to listen to our
[36:06] pastor why because we are flesh
[36:10] and so there's going to be things in
[36:12] that flesh that have to be
[36:14] you know sincerity is it speaks of of
[36:19] actually destroying something or killing
[36:21] something dying to something amen
[36:24] amen and this is something that that
[36:26] Paul said he said I died daily
[36:29] Jesus said If any man follow us to
[36:32] follow me let him take up his cross and
[36:34] follow me got to take up his cross he
[36:36] said if he doesn't do it he's not worthy
[36:37] of me
[36:38] and so there has to be a moment at which
[36:40] we've heard all these things we know
[36:41] that this is real that we're coming into
[36:44] it we've got a revelation of it we can
[36:45] walk in any door
[36:47] but to do that requires sincerity in our
[36:50] daily walk that will actually get to a
[36:53] point where we where we our body begins
[36:55] to believe that we're a Christian
[36:58] and our children begins to begin to
[37:00] believe that we're Christians our
[37:02] churches begin to believe that we're
[37:03] Christians
[37:05] were opening of the word is not just an
[37:08] idea
[37:12] to live life
[37:14] amen and it's how you treat one another
[37:17] and how has preachers treat one another
[37:20] that's right
[37:21] I told my church just get a little bit
[37:23] personal but Valentine's Day is coming
[37:24] up but I told my church I said don't
[37:26] tell me that you you love God and you
[37:29] hate your wife
[37:31] you can't do it
[37:34] because at some point if you hate your
[37:35] wife you love you don't love God
[37:38] can it take a little bit further if you
[37:40] hate anybody
[37:44] how can you have the love of God in your
[37:46] heart and hate people
[37:48] but you don't understand what people did
[37:50] but they did it in ignorance
[37:52] you understand what Jesus did he placed
[37:55] the whole world under ignorance
[37:57] he said father they don't know what
[37:58] they're doing forgive them they should
[38:01] have known of all the people on the
[38:03] Earth they should have known
[38:05] they should have known better
[38:07] well that person should have known
[38:09] better and that's true but Jesus
[38:13] Jesus had such a character about him
[38:16] this is the character of God that we're
[38:18] to have that he cried out father forgive
[38:21] them they don't know what they're doing
[38:22] and they should have known
[38:24] they falsely accused him he went through
[38:27] six trials in one day and they
[38:29] everywhere they found there was nothing
[38:30] wrong with him they had no reason to put
[38:33] him to death it was proved to them who
[38:35] he was he did Miracles and signs and
[38:37] wonders and they still did not believe
[38:40] and yet he concluded them in unbelief
[38:42] and Paul when he come around and
[38:43] persecuted Christians to come back later
[38:45] and he said I did it ignorantly
[38:47] and you remember if you go back to the
[38:48] Old Testament there was a there was a
[38:50] sacrifice for those who done it
[38:52] ignorantly if you did it on purpose
[38:54] there was no hope but if you did it
[38:55] ignorantly there was a sacrifice oh my
[38:59] do we live in we did it they did it in
[39:01] ignorance and so we reach a place where
[39:03] the opening of the word to us means we
[39:05] can forgive
[39:06] the opening of the word to us means we
[39:08] can love the opening of the word to us
[39:11] orders our families
[39:13] right the opening of the word for us
[39:14] makes us to us makes us different than
[39:16] the culture around us
[39:19] makes us love one another with brotherly
[39:21] love makes us different than Kingdom
[39:23] Builders
[39:25] we are not building kingdoms we're
[39:27] building God's Kingdom
[39:30] hmm
[39:31] my voice told brother Brandon you must
[39:33] be more sincere
[39:34] I hear that today speaking through the
[39:36] message to me
[39:38] you must be more sincere
[39:40] notice Joshua chapter 1.
[39:42] notice what the Lord tells Joshua we'll
[39:45] go to verse 2 Moses my servant is dead
[39:48] now therefore rise go over this Jordan
[39:49] thou and all these people into the land
[39:51] which had to give to them even to the
[39:53] children of Israel
[39:54] every place that the soul of your foot
[39:56] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[39:58] you as I said unto Moses from the
[40:01] Wilderness in this Lebanon even unto the
[40:03] Great River the river Euphrates all the
[40:04] land of the Hittites unto the great sea
[40:06] toward the going down of the sun shall
[40:07] be your Coast
[40:09] there shall not any man be able to stand
[40:12] before thee all the days of thy life as
[40:15] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[40:17] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[40:20] strong and of a good courage no watch
[40:22] what he's telling and be strong of a
[40:24] good courage Joshua I know you're strong
[40:26] but be stronger Joshua I know you have
[40:29] courage have good courage
[40:31] because you're going to need it
[40:33] because in the land where all the
[40:34] promises lay us where the battle will be
[40:36] fought
[40:37] so now he says as I was with Moses I'll
[40:39] be with thee be strong of encouragement
[40:41] unto this people shall not divide for an
[40:43] inheritance to lamb which I swear unto
[40:45] their fathers to give them only be thou
[40:47] strong now notice how he keeps coming
[40:48] back to this very courageous the dumbass
[40:51] observed to do according to all the law
[40:53] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[40:55] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[40:57] the left the domain is Prosper with us
[40:59] whoever thou goest now notice what he's
[41:01] telling him be sincere about it
[41:04] huh
[41:05] be sincere don't have two minds about it
[41:07] don't don't use it for your own purposes
[41:11] don't don't abuse it to abuse people
[41:14] with it
[41:16] we've seen too much of that
[41:18] but he said be strong with it be
[41:20] courageous
[41:22] because the land is yours
[41:24] now he said that must Prosper with us
[41:27] over thy ghost this book of the law
[41:28] shall not depart out of thy mouth Thou
[41:30] shalt meditate therein day and night I
[41:31] must observe to do all according to all
[41:33] that is written therein for then should
[41:35] thou shall make thy way prosperous then
[41:36] shalt thou have good success have not I
[41:39] commanded thee be strong and of a good
[41:42] courage be not afraid
[41:44] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[41:46] thy God is with thee withersoever thou
[41:48] goest
[41:50] Joshua be sincere with what you've been
[41:53] given be strong be courageous
[41:55] and we finally when Joshua comes into
[41:57] the land now into the land where the
[41:59] promises slave he finds himself in the
[42:01] Battle of his life
[42:03] but he's a winner
[42:06] right he's a winner
[42:09] but he gets in this battle and he finds
[42:11] these Kings have come up against him and
[42:13] he's putting him putting them to the
[42:15] he's putting them to flight
[42:18] they're running away from that's the way
[42:20] we ought to live
[42:21] right now
[42:23] oh no what's the devil going to do to me
[42:25] today but every morning say what am I
[42:27] going to do to the devil today
[42:29] the devil gets nervous when I get up
[42:31] that's the way it ought to be
[42:33] it don't always feel that way but he
[42:35] does
[42:36] so Joshua gets in the Battle of his life
[42:38] and the enemy is running but it's almost
[42:40] out of time in the day
[42:41] and in Joshua chapter 10 and verse 12
[42:44] Joshua's in there and he doesn't have
[42:47] time for a prayer meeting
[42:49] he don't have time to call Church
[42:51] this happened at work
[42:56] he's got a sword in his hand
[42:59] right
[43:00] he's slaying his enemy Joshua didn't
[43:02] lead from behind he was right there in
[43:04] the front that's the way Ministry is
[43:07] you're right there in front of the
[43:08] people
[43:09] and you lead it from the front you fight
[43:11] with them
[43:13] because the same battles that you fight
[43:14] it's the same ones we fight
[43:16] you think preachers don't get complexes
[43:19] think preachers don't get tired
[43:21] of course we do
[43:23] your pastor does too I know it seems
[43:26] like Superman but
[43:28] even Superman was a man
[43:33] he got in the Battle of his life
[43:36] the enemy's running away but the sun is
[43:39] going down this is a good reason
[43:42] he's not just wanting to part the water
[43:44] so we can go to Starbucks
[43:47] right
[43:49] he's not just praying Lord make life
[43:51] easier on me today
[43:52] although that might be a good thing to
[43:54] pray
[43:55] but that's not what he's praying said
[43:57] Lord I see enemies dying all around me
[44:01] I see the Enemy being defeated
[44:04] and I want to continue to defeat that
[44:07] enemy
[44:08] and the natural world is going to stop
[44:11] me
[44:16] the passage of time is going to stop me
[44:19] from doing what you promised me I could
[44:21] do
[44:23] so he just said Lord
[44:25] he didn't even say Lord he said Son
[44:28] stand still
[44:32] oh God now how could he do that he was
[44:35] in the land where the promises lay
[44:38] right the same place where you are
[44:41] you believe that this morning
[44:43] and he had a need of it and he said Son
[44:45] stand out still in that Moon
[44:51] Stood Still the moon stayed until the
[44:54] people had Avenged themselves upon their
[44:55] enemies and Son the son stood still in
[44:57] the midst of heaven and hasted not to go
[44:59] down about a whole day there was no day
[45:00] like that before or after that the Lord
[45:02] hearkened unto the voice of the man of a
[45:04] man for the Lord fought for Israel
[45:08] foreign
[45:36] you had to be more sincere
[45:38] you can't stand there fumbling your mind
[45:40] and say it right
[45:42] you've got to be inspired to say it
[45:45] huh and this is where everybody is
[45:48] because to be honest with you there's a
[45:50] lot of carnality in our interpretations
[45:51] and
[45:52] and a way we would like this to work
[45:57] where I could just speak and everything
[45:59] would work right for me and I would
[46:01] speak and but look how it was used
[46:04] when the opening of this came it was a
[46:07] spoken word to brother Branham and the
[46:09] third poll how was it used squirrels
[46:13] a tumor the different things that were
[46:16] there and then what he had need of and
[46:18] then Hattie Wright which is the example
[46:20] where it was used a woman
[46:23] a prepared person
[46:26] and brother Brandon makes a statement
[46:27] that it was had he had to be the right
[46:29] kind of a person for that to take place
[46:33] are you still with that I'm almost
[46:35] closing almost closing
[46:39] you had to be the right kind of a person
[46:41] God came to her for a reason
[46:44] and so she was sitting there he said God
[46:47] come to God came to someone who would do
[46:49] it that way knowing that she wouldn't
[46:52] ask for wealth or riches
[46:54] but you would ask for her children
[46:56] and so he said you can't stumble there
[46:58] in your mind or fumble in your mind and
[46:59] say you've got to be inspired to say it
[47:01] notice Mark 11 23 verily I say unto you
[47:04] that whosoever shall say unto this
[47:05] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[47:07] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[47:08] his heart but shall believe that those
[47:09] things which he saith someone say he
[47:11] saith
[47:12] who is that that's us
[47:15] that thing that he's saying but you'll
[47:17] believe that those things which he says
[47:18] shall come to pass he shall have
[47:20] whatsoever he's saith
[47:22] notice brother Brown said when you have
[47:24] a need
[47:25] when you have a need perhaps like Joshua
[47:28] he had a need he never thought of the
[47:31] circumstances
[47:34] and the word of God he never thought
[47:36] because he was he was doing what the
[47:38] what the angel told him be strong be
[47:40] courageous
[47:41] stay in the word and so he found himself
[47:44] in that position he never had another
[47:46] thought of the circumstances he spoke it
[47:49] and it was God
[47:50] he said Do you believe the sun Stood
[47:52] Still so do I how did it do it don't try
[47:54] to figure it out but it did it
[47:56] Joshua did it and raised his hands in
[48:00] that crucial moment he had access to God
[48:04] this is what I want you to understand
[48:07] that the opening of the word what was
[48:09] behind that door it was the revelation
[48:11] of Jesus Christ
[48:13] [Music]
[48:14] that's what the message the message is
[48:16] Christ it was Christ being revealed to
[48:19] us when you are with Christ when you are
[48:21] where he is anything is possible the
[48:24] woman with the blood issue said if I
[48:25] could just Touch the Hem of His Garment
[48:28] foreign
[48:29] are you hearing me this morning
[48:32] this is where we live
[48:34] we have to press through but we have
[48:36] access
[48:38] we have to pray but we have access we
[48:42] struggle but we have access
[48:45] he said he raised his hands to that
[48:46] crucial moment he had access to God and
[48:49] that's what happened it was Timely
[48:52] who am I the spirit of the Living God
[48:55] has seen the need of it
[48:56] and pushed upon Joshua to say it
[49:00] yeah you can't just do it yourself but
[49:02] the spirit of the Living God had need of
[49:04] it and seen the need of it don't you see
[49:06] God sees your need he knows why you came
[49:09] here this morning
[49:10] he knows all about it
[49:13] you don't understand sometimes we're
[49:15] disappointed
[49:17] and who preached or what happened but
[49:18] listen I'd be disappointed too I was
[49:21] disappointed I had to preach this
[49:22] morning
[49:24] but listen to me
[49:26] God ordains these things on purpose
[49:30] and you don't know how many mountains he
[49:32] moved for us to have this service this
[49:35] morning
[49:37] you don't know how many years that's
[49:39] been in the war
[49:41] [Music]
[49:43] in the world oh God
[49:45] you don't understand we take it for
[49:47] granted the church that we're in the
[49:48] building we're standing in this
[49:49] beautiful building that you all have
[49:50] here wasn't here a few years ago you
[49:52] weren't here a few years ago you weren't
[49:53] together we take that for granted you
[49:55] don't know what mountains God moved
[49:58] take advantage of it
[50:02] brother said the spirit of the Living
[50:04] God has seen the need of it and pushed
[50:05] upon Joshua to say it the same God had
[50:08] seen the need of confirming seen the
[50:09] need of Abraham the same God seen the
[50:11] need of confirming this scripture to me
[50:14] that that scripture is true too he's
[50:16] speaking Amen to Mark 11 23 he confirmed
[50:19] this scripture to me that that scripture
[50:21] is true too the same God seen the need
[50:23] of those two predestinated boys you
[50:25] think you don't see today your children
[50:26] are out of the Ark of Safety maybe
[50:28] you're here this morning and you're
[50:30] bored by the service you and yet you're
[50:32] worried about what's going on and you
[50:33] wanted to get to lunch but God sees your
[50:35] need
[50:40] he's seen the need of those two
[50:41] predestinated boys and it was that
[50:43] moment he proved it and confirmed his
[50:45] word
[50:47] listen
[50:49] musicians go ahead and come I'm done
[50:54] if you made the sun stand still
[50:58] listen if he delivered you realize he's
[50:59] already delivered you from death
[51:03] I was dead in trespasses and sins
[51:06] I was all those things that Paul talked
[51:08] about that's what I was he said but
[51:10] you've been walked
[51:13] the water the washing of the water of
[51:15] the word and instead so you never did it
[51:17] in the first place you've been Washed by
[51:19] the Water of the bleeding word you stood
[51:21] under it you've heard it and you're
[51:23] standing here this morning if he saved
[51:25] you from spiritual death if he saved you
[51:27] from what you were if he saved you from
[51:29] yourself don't you think that the
[51:31] Rapture well you'll just walk into that
[51:33] one of these days don't be afraid of it
[51:35] don't worry about it if death has been
[51:37] destroyed everything under death is
[51:39] destroyed can you see that this morning
[51:42] the power to bind him the worst or any
[51:44] now think about it
[51:47] your head bow and your eye closed
[51:49] your eyes closed
[51:54] that has been bound
[51:56] [Music]
[52:00] if you want something from God you need
[52:02] to give him your whole your whole
[52:04] thoughts right now
[52:07] I need to focus on him for just a moment
[52:12] death has been destroyed
[52:15] think about the worst thing that you
[52:16] fear
[52:17] [Music]
[52:20] think about
[52:22] the cancer or the
[52:24] anxiety that you face every night you
[52:26] can't sleep
[52:29] maybe you thought of taking your own
[52:31] life because that's just the age we live
[52:32] in those thoughts are circulating
[52:34] through the air
[52:37] maybe you think your family doesn't love
[52:38] you the church doesn't love maybe this
[52:40] is your last service on the earth then
[52:42] I'll never go back to church again
[52:46] but God knew you would be here this
[52:48] morning
[52:49] foreign
[52:49] [Music]
[52:53] everything under death
[52:57] is unlocked
[53:00] so if I need joy in my life all I have
[53:03] to do is walk through that door
[53:07] he's given me a key how can brother
[53:09] Branham tell people he said go and go be
[53:12] happy
[53:13] sing a song don't worry about it
[53:16] don't think about it no more those
[53:18] people are going through real things but
[53:21] the door to Healing had been unlocked
[53:24] and he said you could you walk into it
[53:26] you see yourself in a new body you see
[53:28] yourself in a well body and you walk
[53:30] into it
[53:32] it's everything under death it's been
[53:34] destroyed this isn't my the prophet
[53:36] taught everything under death has been
[53:38] destroyed what about what you're dealing
[53:40] with right now why don't you put your
[53:43] feet on top of it
[53:45] why don't you walk through that door
[53:50] I'm just giving you a moment
[53:53] why don't you be more sincere
[53:56] maybe
[53:57] everybody there and it has a different
[54:00] kind of service why is he doing this
[54:03] something some some work day or
[54:05] something around the church you think
[54:07] well
[54:07] I don't know if I should be involved why
[54:09] don't why don't you just go the extra
[54:10] mile and
[54:14] I
[54:16] I thought of and just as during this
[54:18] moment I
[54:19] I preach Wednesday night in Tucson
[54:22] about Simon the man that was
[54:26] standing there just happened to be
[54:28] standing
[54:29] at an intersection
[54:32] when Jesus come by
[54:35] and the soldier looked up and said you
[54:36] carry his cross
[54:39] and that was with the moment when the
[54:40] body of Christ fell and all the promises
[54:42] that we have of a redeemer
[54:44] the one hanging on a cross said if I be
[54:46] lifted up all under all men unto me none
[54:48] of those promises could have been
[54:50] fulfilled had he remained there on the
[54:52] Via Dolorosa but Simon
[54:55] went and picked up his cross he was
[54:57] compelled she said to pick up his cross
[54:59] and carry it
[55:01] that changed his whole life
[55:04] the trajectory of his life and his
[55:05] family I wonder if that could be you
[55:07] this morning maybe this is that moment
[55:09] [Music]
[55:11] it just changed the whole tenor of your
[55:13] life
[55:15] I was standing here at an intersection
[55:17] and
[55:18] the body of Christ come by I realized
[55:21] there was a need
[55:22] Lord help me bury that cross

[55:30] I do is even if I'm not a preacher or a
[55:32] Sunday school teacher that my place in
[55:34] the body
[55:36] let me be more sincere
[55:39] maybe there's someone here this morning
[55:40] you
[55:41] you see the promises of God you see
[55:43] they're there but you've never really
[55:44] walked in them like you should would you
[55:46] raise your hand this morning I want to
[55:48] pray with you God bless you God bless
[55:49] those hands you see it but it's just
[55:52] maybe you need to be born again maybe
[55:54] maybe you have had an experience with
[55:56] God but you you just haven't been able
[55:58] to grab a hold of it like you should
[56:00] you could do that this morning
