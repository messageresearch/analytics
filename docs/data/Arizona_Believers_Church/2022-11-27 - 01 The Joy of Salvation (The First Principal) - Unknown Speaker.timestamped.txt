[0:02] so again in this introductory sermon on
[0:06] the subject of the joy of salvation of
[0:08] the subtitle is the first principle you
[0:11] might notice it's spelled a little bit
[0:12] different than the principles we see
[0:13] here in the scripture and that's because
[0:15] I'm wanting to look at something as far
[0:17] as a principle but the first principle
[0:19] we're drawing a little bit here from
[0:21] when Paul says that you need to be
[0:23] taught again the first principles of the
[0:25] Oracles of God here in Hebrews chapter
[0:27] 5. and I know that's a very familiar
[0:30] scripture I know even for myself as I
[0:31] look back at the number of things that
[0:33] we've ministered in the different times
[0:34] we've ministered throughout the entirety
[0:36] of our ministry this is a scripture that
[0:38] we've looked at quite a bit leading into
[0:40] chapter six it has a tremendous amount
[0:43] of weight for me personally I think it
[0:45] has tremendous relevance to the message
[0:46] and the things that brother Branham was
[0:48] teaching us especially if you look in
[0:50] terms of the revelation of who is this
[0:51] Melchizedek and his tie-in to Christ and
[0:54] so these are very familiar scriptures
[0:56] even today as we add some layers to this
[0:58] and can be extremely familiar scriptures
[1:01] and precepts so I don't believe that
[1:03] there's necessarily anything new or
[1:05] mysterious that you should be looking
[1:06] for just if anything just some reminders
[1:09] of the things that we believe and some
[1:11] encouragement and I want to start with
[1:14] uh Psalms 51 verse 12 just to kind of
[1:16] build this uh this subject of the joy of
[1:20] Salvation And it says in Psalms 51 verse
[1:23] 12 restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:27] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[1:29] spirit now this is again a very familiar
[1:32] scripture to us we know that it's uh of
[1:34] David's exclamation and his his prayer
[1:37] and his cry after the time of his
[1:39] failure with Bathsheba and this he even
[1:41] speaks of how these let these bones that
[1:44] you have broken Rejoice again let joy
[1:46] and gladness return unto me and he prays
[1:49] this prayer and he cries his heart is
[1:51] crying out restoring to me the joy of
[1:53] thy salvation now we could just take
[1:55] this scripture within its context and
[1:57] preach almost endlessly on David's
[2:00] attitude David's sin David's attitude
[2:02] repentance um and and all that what's
[2:05] meant in this idea of the joy of
[2:07] salvation but what I'm wanting to
[2:09] introduce at the beginning just so that
[2:11] you uh
[2:12] maybe it's only just to help me but I
[2:15] want to share this in the beginning that
[2:16] Joy Godly Joy is connected with his
[2:19] salvation when David says restore unto
[2:21] me the joy of thy salvation we can
[2:23] certainly take from this that the
[2:25] psalmist is writing and it's expressed
[2:27] to us that this Joy can be interrupted
[2:30] that this Joy can be lost as it were and
[2:33] so there's a there's a there's a joy
[2:35] that comes with salvation there's a joy
[2:37] that comes with the deliverance and
[2:38] whatever it is that we could take
[2:40] David's joy to uh that God had done he
[2:44] associated with God's Deliverance with
[2:45] his salvation and he says whatever
[2:47] enthusiasm that brought whatever joy
[2:50] that brought I've lost it for a season
[2:52] it's been interrupted it's been taken
[2:54] away from me so part of David's prayer
[2:56] and his repentance was not just merely
[2:59] to know that whatever judgment was
[3:02] passed and that he could move Beyond
[3:04] this but there was something that he had
[3:05] lost and it tells us that the joy God's
[3:08] joy that comes with his salvation is
[3:10] something that can that can be taken
[3:12] away from us and I'll say just for a
[3:15] season
[3:15] but the the main thing I'm wanting us to
[3:18] look at and identify is that God's
[3:20] salvation produces Joy that when you are
[3:23] enjoying his salvation when you're
[3:25] participating in his salvation uh God's
[3:28] salvation produces joy and one thing I
[3:31] found in the scripture that was I kind
[3:33] of I said new to me I just had never
[3:36] thought of it this way is joy is a
[3:37] characteristic of God
[3:39] and and you look through the scripture
[3:41] and there's a few different places where
[3:42] God is rejoicing and it's interesting to
[3:45] see that God rejoices in obedience and
[3:47] then at the same time he says I'm going
[3:48] to rejoice in punishing you so I it's
[3:51] it's a characteristic of God that God
[3:53] rejoices and and God has joy and he says
[3:55] in different places in different places
[3:56] I Will Rejoice Over You So This Joy Of
[4:02] This Joy that David This Joy of thy
[4:04] salvation it's not just the Salvation
[4:06] that's of God but the joyous of God
[4:09] and in Luke chapter 15 verse 10 Jesus
[4:12] and giving the parable of that which has
[4:14] been restored and and that lost sheep
[4:16] being restored back he says likewise I
[4:18] say unto you there is joy in the
[4:21] presence of the angels of God over one
[4:23] Center that repenteth
[4:25] and so this it just at the outset just
[4:28] very briefly there's this strong
[4:29] connection between God and joy and even
[4:32] here it's connected again with salvation
[4:34] David says restoring to me the joy of
[4:36] thy salvation
[4:38] Jesus and give you this parable of this
[4:40] lost sheep he says that when one sinner
[4:42] repents there is joy in the presence of
[4:45] the angels of God just as David desired
[4:48] Joy at the time of his repentance Jesus
[4:50] saying when there is repentance when
[4:51] there's a heart that's turned to him
[4:53] when there's a soul that is saved not
[4:55] only is there Joy on Earth but it
[4:57] resounds in heaven and so there's a
[4:59] strong connection between Joy God and
[5:02] salvation
[5:04] and now
[5:05] in the uh on the subject of the joy of
[5:09] Salvation I will in doing in looking at
[5:12] this subject we will actually
[5:14] I'll kind of we'll be tying it in maybe
[5:16] if the Lord would lead to the Christmas
[5:18] season uh you may be able to be able to
[5:20] tell by my color scheme uh that there
[5:22] may be some ties into the Christmas
[5:24] season we'll forgo Christmas this year
[5:26] but we will we will look at the thoughts
[5:29] uh that we associate with Christmas
[5:31] hopefully bring a greater love and
[5:33] appreciation for the things of God
[5:34] through it but this is a series that's
[5:37] about salvation now not maybe in a
[5:40] traditional way of when you think of
[5:43] well being saved and being saved and
[5:44] maybe some of the real uh it not a
[5:48] series on salvation where we're just
[5:49] going to keep visiting the same thing of
[5:51] being saved being saved being saved but
[5:53] really taking a step back and asking
[5:55] ourselves even though it may not be in
[5:57] depth it may just be looking at it to
[5:59] cause ourselves to think and to ponder
[6:01] but it's a question of what is salvation
[6:04] uh there's things that maybe we don't
[6:06] actually think about we just know that
[6:08] it's happened to us and we go forward
[6:09] but we haven't really looked back and
[6:11] thought what were the consequences of
[6:13] this uh event in my life and even ask
[6:15] ourselves what is salvation what does it
[6:17] produce
[6:18] and but mainly my focus will be on its
[6:22] connection salvation's connection with
[6:24] joy so we could ask ourselves what is
[6:27] salvation how is it that I am saved how
[6:30] are we saved what do we save from
[6:32] they say I'm saved I'm saved I'm saved
[6:34] from my sin well what are we safe from
[6:36] how what am I saved for what's the
[6:39] purpose in my salvation it says a lot of
[6:41] questions we can ask about salvation and
[6:43] as I move forward in this I would say
[6:45] that I'm not I'm wanting you to be an
[6:48] examiner with me today I just want you
[6:50] to invite you to stand with me in my
[6:53] shoes as we look at the word of God and
[6:55] let's look at it together and and in
[6:58] doing so it's not so much that I'm
[7:00] trying to preach something at you for
[7:02] you to receive but I want us to all
[7:04] together look at the subject because I
[7:06] feel that I'm preaching to mature
[7:07] Believers preaching to those who have
[7:09] these things understood and are
[7:12] Fellowship in these things have
[7:12] experienced salvation so we're just
[7:14] together as uh participating this
[7:16] together looking at the subject so I'm
[7:19] not preaching it to you we're looking at
[7:20] it together does that make sense
[7:22] and in this uh as a thought as I've been
[7:26] mulling over it on the the joy of
[7:28] Salvation that phrase just really stuck
[7:30] with me and just felt like it clicked so
[7:32] I wanted to use that as the title uh it
[7:34] is there's so much to be said about
[7:37] salvation
[7:38] there's so much that could be ministered
[7:39] on it but there's so much about
[7:42] salvation that we take for granted
[7:44] and there's a lot about salvation that
[7:46] we just assume based upon things that
[7:48] we've heard and based upon things that
[7:50] have been presented and I find that this
[7:53] is maybe a little bit of an aside but
[7:55] trying to use it as an example that
[7:57] there's things that I've heard preached
[7:58] and I've heard that's been that brother
[8:00] Bradham said and when I've when I've
[8:02] heard it I've it sounded really good to
[8:04] me and I liked it and you could see kind
[8:05] of this connection to the scripture and
[8:07] then you might even find yourself
[8:09] repeating it and quoting it and then you
[8:10] go back and you want to find exactly
[8:12] where it's at and you can't find it it
[8:14] could just be matter be a matter of
[8:15] being a poor research researcher but
[8:18] there's things that you realize I never
[8:20] even took time to I just have built a
[8:22] lot of assumptions on this I never went
[8:24] back and looked at the foundation of it
[8:25] I never even considered what the
[8:27] implications were and so this is
[8:30] something that even on the subject of
[8:31] Salvation there's a lot of things that
[8:33] we not only take for granted but there's
[8:34] a lot of things based upon it the truth
[8:36] of it that we just assume not that our
[8:39] assumptions are wrong but what we've
[8:40] done is we've just kind of adopted that
[8:42] thinking and it's true and it's and it's
[8:45] real but we've never taken time to get
[8:47] it down to its real core to understand
[8:49] it and maybe even more more importantly
[8:53] I'll say this about salvation there's a
[8:55] lot of ways that salvation is diminished
[8:57] and you think well how can salvation be
[8:59] diminished well if I could say that
[9:02] whatever salvation is then it's for it's
[9:05] for someone in particular
[9:07] and if there's a way that you define
[9:09] salvation to where it loses its its
[9:12] particularity to that group or to that
[9:15] person and you begin to attach it to a
[9:17] lot of other things and a lot of other
[9:19] people it really loses its value
[9:22] for the person that it's intended and so
[9:26] I'm using I I guess I just need to come
[9:28] right out and say it I don't I'm not
[9:29] necessarily trying to hold it back but I
[9:31] just don't want to get pulled down this
[9:32] this channel that we use the phrase
[9:35] saved and we even use it in the sense to
[9:37] identify a group of people that we would
[9:40] say Well they're not they don't actually
[9:41] have the Holy Ghost or they're not
[9:43] actually uh the bride but they're saved
[9:47] and we take the category of Bride and
[9:50] everyone else who saved and if you if
[9:52] you're not careful what you've done is
[9:54] you've created this hierarchy or these
[9:57] categories that if they're not
[9:59] absolutely accurate and scriptural
[10:01] you've devalued something somewhere and
[10:04] you take the real truth to Salvation you
[10:06] say well well these are all saved and
[10:08] these all have it and these are all this
[10:10] and then this category over here you
[10:12] create this category of bride I think
[10:14] the way I've used it before is like the
[10:15] the super saved or something and they're
[10:18] and they're they're saved like everyone
[10:20] else is saved but they just
[10:22] they're just bride right and we don't we
[10:26] almost begin to lose the real
[10:28] significance of Salvation when we so
[10:31] quickly attach it to all sorts of
[10:33] different categories or Define it to try
[10:35] to fit some model where we're trying to
[10:37] make sense of things and so I believe
[10:40] that the greatest mistake we can make is
[10:42] diminish what salvation is or misplace
[10:45] it scripturally in terms of where it
[10:47] actually resides and who it's for
[10:50] in Romans chapter 1 verse 16 I share
[10:52] this to express how that we ought to
[10:54] never diminish salvation Paul says for I
[10:57] am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[10:59] for it is the power of God unto
[11:02] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[11:04] the Jew first and also to the Greek
[11:08] so he said he's saying there's no
[11:10] dishonor in the gospel of Christ on no
[11:13] level is there any dishonor is there any
[11:15] uh any part of it that we ought to be
[11:18] ashamed of nor is there any
[11:20] disappointment in the gospel of Christ
[11:21] for the believer Paul is saying I am not
[11:24] ashamed of the gospel of Christ the
[11:26] gospel of Christ will not disappoint you
[11:28] the gospel of Christ will not let you
[11:30] down and there is no dishonor in the
[11:33] gospel of Christ and Paul says for it is
[11:35] the power of God unto salvation to
[11:38] everyone that believeth so it's to the
[11:39] Believers that there is no
[11:41] disappointment or shame in the gospel it
[11:43] is to the believer that it's the power
[11:44] of God unto salvation and then he breaks
[11:46] down that barrier of distinction between
[11:48] Jew and Gentile uh it is it is the power
[11:51] of God but look at it from this
[11:53] perspective when he says it is the power
[11:55] of God it's God's power that
[11:58] accomplishes salvation so the gospel of
[12:01] Christ is the power of God what does the
[12:03] power of God produce it's if we can look
[12:05] at it from this senses God has power
[12:07] God's had power what but what is its
[12:10] first result what does it produce what
[12:11] is Paul saying that is so beautiful
[12:13] about the gospel of Christ that we ought
[12:15] not to be ashamed of it because it
[12:16] produces salvation
[12:18] if that's what the power of God produces
[12:21] we do not want to ever diminish or
[12:23] devalue salvation because it's the first
[12:26] result it's the first fruit of the power
[12:28] of God
[12:30] makes this statement I'm just sharing it
[12:32] out outside of the context of the larger
[12:35] point he's trying to make says what more
[12:37] what could you achieve that would be
[12:39] greater than your salvation
[12:42] what is greater than salvation
[12:45] he even uses the example of if God could
[12:48] give a man something better outside of a
[12:50] wife then salvation than he would have
[12:52] done it and so he said the greatest gift
[12:55] out of Salvation is a Godly wife so that
[12:58] means the greatest gift the greatest
[13:00] thing is salvation
[13:02] that places it on this level that if
[13:04] you're going to be and if I could say
[13:06] this that that that very statement joins
[13:10] very beautifully true salvation and
[13:12] marriage
[13:13] because that is that is what that is the
[13:16] real
[13:17] the real depth of the fullness of
[13:19] Salvation as it relates to the bride but
[13:22] what more could God do or what more
[13:24] could you achieve that would be greater
[13:25] than your salvation nothing
[13:28] it is the greatest
[13:30] and the sermon is shamed the brother
[13:32] says in any disciple of Christ who has
[13:34] come in contact with him in Redemption
[13:36] and salvation and those are those are in
[13:39] Redemption and he says and salvation has
[13:41] come into his heart Redemption and
[13:42] salvation are two principles that are
[13:44] joined together he says Redemption and
[13:46] salvation is coming to his heart he is
[13:48] the possessor of God
[13:50] when salvation is coming to your heart
[13:52] you are a possessor of God when a person
[13:55] is saved that means they possess present
[13:58] tense eternal life and cannot pass into
[14:01] cannot go into judgment do not even go
[14:03] into the same category of death as the
[14:05] unbeliever to be saved is the utmost it
[14:08] is the greatest it is the greatest thing
[14:10] God could give you a person who has
[14:13] where salvation is coming his heart says
[14:15] he is a possessor of God
[14:19] very hard to think of a greater way to
[14:22] play salvation than to say that someone
[14:24] who has been saved now possesses deity
[14:28] and in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 we
[14:30] looked at this here very recently I
[14:32] believe he says but beloved we are
[14:33] persuaded better things of you and
[14:36] things that accompany salvation though
[14:38] we thus speak
[14:40] we're going to touch on the beginning to
[14:42] hear of Hebrews chapter 6 as it flows
[14:43] from chapter 5 into chapter six Paul
[14:45] didn't structure it with chapters but in
[14:47] the convenience of references it's been
[14:49] written out chapter 5 chapter 6 but in
[14:51] this larger thought of Paul said I have
[14:53] more to say about Melchizedek I have
[14:55] more to say about Christ but I can't do
[14:56] it we need to revisit the first
[14:58] principles and he's saying let us go on
[14:59] to Perfection he says now for you and he
[15:02] kind of drops down into what happens to
[15:04] those who can't go forward he says but
[15:05] I'm persuaded better things of you
[15:08] and things that accompany salvation
[15:11] uh the phrasing that is used it's things
[15:13] that are linked in the chain of
[15:15] salvation
[15:16] things that are joying to it things that
[15:19] are connected to Salvation so we have
[15:21] salvation and there's things that are in
[15:24] the chain of Salvation now if there's
[15:27] things that are linked to and connected
[15:29] to Salvation in the chain of Salvation
[15:31] what we don't want to do is break the
[15:33] chain and say well you have salvation
[15:35] over here and you have all these other
[15:38] things over here some as some sort of
[15:41] accessories to Salvation
[15:44] and that we can just swap Out
[15:45] Accessories or this accompanies it and
[15:47] we can add this and we can have that but
[15:49] the way that Paul is saying is that it's
[15:51] linked to they're in the chain of
[15:53] Salvation so if you have salvation
[15:55] there's a chain in things that are
[15:57] connected to it that works itself out
[16:02] we read this uh I think in the series on
[16:05] Divine Healing
[16:07] this is again just lift looking at this
[16:09] salvation from a of valuing it he says
[16:13] in the message of paradox he says the
[16:15] church has become just growing up just
[16:17] like I was going to speak tonight upon
[16:19] the unveiling of the one true God so in
[16:21] the idea of a church maturing and
[16:23] growing
[16:24] he says but I think it's a little too
[16:26] long he says I noticed the people after
[16:27] nine o'clock they get Restless I thought
[16:29] I would just wait
[16:31] until sometime at the Tabernacle I got
[16:33] something else on my mind maybe for
[16:34] tonight to bring a message
[16:36] of Salvation that's what we're trying to
[16:39] do here
[16:40] now you Minister Brothers we missed
[16:42] Divine healings right and and you could
[16:45] see that from this I think what we
[16:47] talked about before is they put so much
[16:48] emphasis on the Divine Healing part and
[16:50] they left out the other parts he says
[16:52] this old Dr Bosworth who just went home
[16:53] to Glory down here recently he used to
[16:55] say Divine he owns a bait that you put
[16:57] on the hook you never show The Fish Hook
[16:58] you show them the bait he hits the bait
[17:00] and gets the hook so that's the way it
[17:02] is Divine Healing just draws the
[17:05] attention and he says and then salvation
[17:07] is what we are after and this particular
[17:10] uh sermon here is he says that we're
[17:13] trying to we want to bring a message of
[17:15] Salvation tonight as he refers to it as
[17:17] tonight as this is in the the
[17:18] businessman's breakfast he says I'm
[17:20] going to bring a message to Salvation he
[17:22] says salvation is what we're after
[17:23] anyways we're after the strength of the
[17:27] body of Christ
[17:28] now what what is the strength of the
[17:31] body of Christ it is salvation
[17:33] the strength what makes the body of
[17:35] Christ who she is is that she has this
[17:38] designation of having been saved from
[17:40] sin having been saved from Darkness
[17:42] saved from something there's been a
[17:44] separating out that's what salvation
[17:46] speaks of he says we're after the
[17:48] strength of the body of Christ so if I
[17:50] could just add this Romans 1 in Hebrews
[17:52] 6 and these other statements together
[17:54] let me just say this salvation is a
[17:57] beautiful thing that ought not to be
[17:59] diminished and we're better knowing more
[18:02] about it and understanding it more
[18:03] clearly
[18:06] so in uh now taking us to the title for
[18:11] today the first principle
[18:13] let me visit for a little bit the first
[18:15] principles
[18:17] and the and the concept of first
[18:19] principles anybody ever heard of the
[18:21] concept the first principles anybody
[18:23] here no no somebody was scratching their
[18:25] ear almost drew me offside so well we're
[18:28] going to introduce something then today
[18:30] uh anybody read Aristotle Descartes any
[18:34] of the philosophers okay a little bit
[18:35] some well you'll find it and I think
[18:38] it's Aristotle who's given the credit
[18:41] for kind of introducing this thought
[18:42] process it's kind of a way of thinking
[18:44] about things uh Descartes also used it
[18:46] you'll find it in philosophy but you
[18:48] also find a lot of other branches and
[18:49] disciplines mathematics and other things
[18:51] where you have to kind of come back to
[18:53] this idea of the first principles
[18:55] and let me Define it this way the first
[18:57] principle is the basic assumption that
[18:59] cannot be deduced any further
[19:01] so you could have something and you
[19:04] could have like a body of ideas or some
[19:06] sort of system and if you want to
[19:08] understand it and you want to take a
[19:10] look at it you begin to kind of pick
[19:12] things apart and find out what is it at
[19:14] its core and how can I distill this down
[19:17] and break it down to the point where I
[19:19] can break it down no further so this
[19:21] becomes the basic principle or the first
[19:24] principle that there's all these things
[19:26] that happen afterwards or these all
[19:27] these things that are a part of it but
[19:29] if I'm going to Define it in its most
[19:31] simple way what is the basic most basic
[19:34] as we could say assumption or or a fact
[19:37] of it's a that cannot be further
[19:40] distilled down I think Aristotle put it
[19:43] this way the first basis from which a
[19:44] thing is known
[19:46] and so this is what first principles is
[19:48] the first upon what basic element is
[19:50] something known it's the primary cause
[19:52] of something or the basic elements
[19:55] so when you have this concept the first
[19:57] principles and you look at it you
[19:59] establish you want to establish this
[20:01] fundamental truth that stands on its own
[20:03] that's what a first principle is it
[20:05] stands on its own no matter what's been
[20:07] added to it no matter what assumptions
[20:08] we make the first principle something
[20:10] that stands on its own so you want to
[20:12] establish this fundamental truth and
[20:14] then
[20:15] separate from it all the assumptions
[20:17] that you've you've made about it
[20:20] so that instead of instead of it being
[20:23] surrounded by a bunch of assumptions you
[20:24] get down to the core and say this is the
[20:26] first principle this is this is the
[20:29] basic elements so it's a matter of
[20:31] identifying foundational truths or
[20:33] fundamental truth that stands completely
[20:36] by itself that we do we have not added
[20:39] in our subsequent knowledge or added in
[20:41] our subsequent experience or added in
[20:43] our subsequent assumptions we just come
[20:45] back to the root to the core to the
[20:47] principle
[20:48] if I could uh maybe make the mistake of
[20:51] using an example as a few examples I'm
[20:53] thinking of but the one I thought of the
[20:55] most yesterday was the example of music
[20:57] when it comes to music in Western and
[21:00] music all melodies basically are
[21:03] typically are built from 12 basic notes
[21:06] I got a nod from the musician here so
[21:08] we're it was more kind of like are you
[21:10] sure you want to say that brother Aaron
[21:11] I took it as a nod but let's just say
[21:14] for sake of discussion today that
[21:16] there's 12 basic notes that uh western
[21:19] music is typically arranged from
[21:21] and so you could say that these 12 notes
[21:24] are
[21:26] um the the the
[21:27] fundamental elements the the basic
[21:30] material building blocks of music
[21:32] and so identifying these 12 notes and
[21:36] understanding them and learning how to
[21:39] use them and we may call it music theory
[21:41] is is kind of the it's how Melodies and
[21:45] music are written
[21:47] and these and and understand identifying
[21:49] understanding it using these 12 basic
[21:51] notes would be I would say that's the
[21:53] idea of I'm trying to suggest is the
[21:55] ideas of first principles that when it
[21:57] comes to music if you want to understand
[21:58] music You Want To Know music you want to
[22:00] write music you want to play music if
[22:02] you take the concept of first principles
[22:04] you learn the 12 notes and you find the
[22:07] building blocks of music and when
[22:09] someone understands it knows it
[22:11] understands it and can use it they can
[22:14] write music they can play music because
[22:17] they've got all the Legos of music
[22:19] and they know how they work together
[22:22] but someone can play music and write
[22:24] music using Melodies that have already
[22:27] been written or notes that they've just
[22:29] merely learned and they can write
[22:32] beautiful music and they can play
[22:33] Beautiful music but they're not using
[22:35] first principles
[22:37] they're just playing Melodies they've
[22:39] already learned or Melodies things that
[22:41] have already been written they're
[22:42] singing something that's already been
[22:43] sung and so this is what Aristotle would
[22:45] say that someone has learned by analogy
[22:48] they've learned by the assumptions
[22:50] they've learned by the thing that has
[22:52] already been built the composite that's
[22:54] already there but when someone wants to
[22:56] be able to write music and understand
[22:58] music and play music and you really want
[23:01] to elevate your game as it were get to
[23:03] the first principles does that make
[23:05] sense brother Micah okay good he's I get
[23:07] a thumbs up now that's not really
[23:09] ambiguous
[23:11] that's good
[23:12] and you could even use this when it
[23:14] comes to cooking there's people who know
[23:16] how to follow a recipe and they're
[23:19] absolutely amazing cooks and I'll just
[23:21] say it right now I admire anybody that
[23:23] can follow a recipe and especially
[23:25] somebody who's just learned it to the
[23:26] point where you know you got to do this
[23:27] and you got to do that and there's
[23:29] people that are very very very good at
[23:31] cooking because they know how to follow
[23:33] a recipe but then there's other people
[23:36] that understand food and ingredients and
[23:39] the science of cooking and they know
[23:41] what's happening when you do this and
[23:43] they know what's happening we do that I
[23:44] look back in my life and all the times
[23:46] as a kid I love to cook I still love to
[23:47] cook and and sometimes my family says my
[23:51] dad loves to smoke and I go meat me I
[23:54] love to smoke meat
[23:56] and the uh and I look back in the things
[23:59] that I used to do to food when I was
[24:01] cooking it I was absolutely destroying
[24:03] the food
[24:04] because they're you're breaking down the
[24:07] the structure and you're you're handling
[24:09] this too much and you're mixing this too
[24:11] much and you're adding that at the wrong
[24:12] time and all the things that I thought
[24:14] is what went into cooking went against
[24:16] the real science and the real against
[24:19] even the basic ingredients like this is
[24:21] why this is being added and this is why
[24:24] you do this if you don't understand that
[24:26] you can put together a recipe but if you
[24:28] don't understand first principles you're
[24:30] always going to need a recipe
[24:33] but when you understand first principles
[24:36] you can have all the ingredients and put
[24:38] build something yourself and put
[24:40] something together yourself that is
[24:42] going to remain true to the fundamentals
[24:46] that's what can happen when someone
[24:47] understands first principles anybody
[24:49] ever seen and I know this is just I'm
[24:51] taking a flyer here the cooking shows
[24:53] that exist today where they give people
[24:55] a box of ingredients and it's jelly
[24:58] beans and it's fish slime and it's a and
[25:01] it's a shoe shoe leather and they're
[25:03] like make something and they go I know
[25:05] exactly what I'm going to make
[25:07] and I'm going
[25:08] I mean I would probably just put it out
[25:10] there and be like this is deconstructed
[25:13] whatever
[25:14] right
[25:15] and this is and you look at people and
[25:18] they know how to do it and I I know for
[25:21] me when I've seen it I Marvel
[25:23] at how they can take these ingredients
[25:25] and put something together
[25:27] and they can bring something out of it
[25:29] and why because they understand they
[25:30] look at the ingredient go oh this has
[25:32] this kind of quality this is how I can
[25:34] prepare this and they understand the
[25:36] first principles of cooking it's not
[25:38] just what recipe is there in my Betty
[25:40] Crocker cookbook that has these
[25:42] ingredients they understand the first
[25:44] principles of cooking and the
[25:46] ingredients and therefore they know how
[25:48] to work with it
[25:49] this is the idea of first principles is
[25:51] that making sense
[25:53] first principles then is understanding
[25:55] the building blocks
[25:56] in order to build a greater knowledge
[25:59] in order to build a greater experience
[26:00] we read recently in Isaiah 33 6 I think
[26:03] it was last Sunday and wisdom and
[26:04] knowledge shall be the stability of thy
[26:06] times
[26:07] and strength of Salvation the fear of
[26:09] the Lord is his treasure
[26:11] there's a strength I want definitely
[26:13] want you to kisses there's a strength
[26:15] that arises from salvation
[26:17] but where is it manifest in wisdom and
[26:19] knowledge
[26:21] wisdom and not shall be the stability of
[26:23] thy times and strength of thy salvation
[26:25] there's a strength of salvation but it's
[26:27] the subsequent wisdom and knowledge that
[26:29] pours forth from it that is our
[26:31] stability that is our foundation that
[26:33] become our building blocks upon which we
[26:35] can begin to build our experience in
[26:37] Jesus Christ
[26:39] we read this again multiple times the
[26:41] last two Services no True Believers any
[26:42] stronger and spiritually healthy and
[26:44] Alive than his knowledge of and
[26:46] adherence to the pure word of God what
[26:48] are the building blocks of a healthy
[26:50] Christian Life what are the building
[26:51] blocks of spiritual strength it is our
[26:53] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[26:56] word of God
[26:57] to me there's something that's pointing
[26:59] back to First principles it's pointing
[27:00] back to understanding things at their
[27:02] basic element it's it's being able to
[27:04] take any assumptions that we have in any
[27:07] subsequent experience and be able to
[27:09] bring it back to its core to its
[27:11] fundamentals
[27:12] to its beginning so that we can be like
[27:14] the musician we could be like the chef
[27:16] who understands the ingredients who
[27:19] understands the principles understands
[27:21] the science behind it
[27:23] I I kept I put it in my notes I don't
[27:25] know how many times I put it in and
[27:26] deleted it but his brother man makes
[27:28] this statement and I've had I've never
[27:29] preached on it but something stood out
[27:31] to me I've kept it for all these years
[27:32] I'm going to reveal it today
[27:34] right now brother Branham said he'd been
[27:37] compiling material in order to preach
[27:39] the second coming of the Lord
[27:40] scientifically
[27:44] and and he says he somehow I want to do
[27:46] it I want to prove it scientifically
[27:48] this coming to the Lord scientifically
[27:49] and I was going to read it just to get
[27:50] us all to ponder
[27:54] how can you preach the second coming
[27:56] scientifically how could he gather
[27:59] research and principles and all these
[28:01] things together and put together in
[28:03] order to preach the second coming
[28:04] scientifically now I think I've said
[28:07] enough that if you want to just start
[28:08] researching it it's fascinating
[28:13] I was going to start singing Take the
[28:15] name of Jesus with you but the song that
[28:16] came to my mind was bring them in and
[28:18] that would have really confused all of
[28:20] us
[28:22] now if we can look at Hebrews chapter 5.
[28:25] I hope that I've been able to establish
[28:27] two things the importance of Salvation
[28:29] or maybe more than two but the
[28:30] importance of Salvation and the concept
[28:33] of first principles
[28:35] and then you know in that strength and
[28:38] joy and these other principles that have
[28:40] kind of being laid around there
[28:41] spiritual health strength
[28:43] being alive this Vitality in in Hebrews
[28:46] chapter five we'll start with verse 11
[28:47] we'll read our text again
[28:49] uh we mentioned Wednesday night I think
[28:52] it was that the Hebrews were trying to
[28:53] be pulled away from the mystery of
[28:56] Christ uh there was things truth that
[28:58] they had been introduced to there was an
[29:00] experience that they had had in the word
[29:01] of God and now they're being met with
[29:04] all these the these elements of Judaism
[29:06] and all these elements of of the law and
[29:09] these physical tangible things there's
[29:11] something very beautiful uh to the human
[29:13] to be able to know that they can light a
[29:15] candle that they can rub a rosary that
[29:17] they can say a prayer it's nice to be
[29:19] able to kind of check the box right it's
[29:22] nice to know when when things can be
[29:24] completed and you know you can do
[29:25] certain things and so that's one thing
[29:27] about the law that afford that kind of
[29:29] met this human need to be able to say I
[29:31] know that I went and I did this and I
[29:33] did that and there's this the safety and
[29:35] knowing that I've accomplished these
[29:37] particular responsibilities as
[29:39] articulated by the law but then you have
[29:42] this mystery of Christ that in knowing
[29:44] him this one that you have not handled
[29:45] you have not touched this one who is now
[29:48] really the substance of the law that
[29:50] you're to believe upon him they were
[29:52] being drawn back into denying the
[29:55] reality of Christ for the for the the
[29:58] legalism and the physical law that you
[30:01] that their religion the former religion
[30:03] offered them and so they're being
[30:05] enticed by the the carnal laws and by
[30:07] these these physical precepts
[30:10] and so uh that maybe that's an overview
[30:13] of
[30:14] kind of maybe the real thrust of the
[30:15] whole book of Hebrews but now in chapter
[30:17] 5 verse 11 he's wanting to say more
[30:20] about Christ who's called to God a high
[30:22] priest after the order of Melchizedek
[30:24] the Son of God
[30:26] and and these beautiful things he's
[30:28] saying in chapter five is being
[30:29] perfected by the things which he
[30:30] suffered such incredible uh truths that
[30:33] he's laying out in this book of Hebrews
[30:35] he says now of Christ and this mystery
[30:38] of Melchizedek of whom we have many
[30:39] things to say and hard to be uttered
[30:41] seeing your Dole of hearing so now he is
[30:44] we want to grasp this here at the start
[30:47] as we read this is they were not able to
[30:51] comprehend and grasp the things that
[30:54] Paul wanted us to say
[30:56] and he says for when the time you ought
[31:00] to be teachers this is really amplifying
[31:02] the Dole of hearing or or him describing
[31:05] the consequences now your dull of
[31:07] hearing and say hey it's a time when you
[31:09] ought to be teachers yourself you ought
[31:11] to understand the material well enough
[31:12] now to where you can teach it
[31:15] he says but if I could go back to the
[31:17] piano lessons this or the music he's
[31:20] saying you guys still need piano lessons
[31:22] when you ought to be piano teachers
[31:25] that and and really anybody who
[31:27] understands you don't have to be a piano
[31:29] teacher but when you find somebody who
[31:30] knows music and they understand the 12
[31:33] notes and they can play they can play
[31:34] those chords they have something that
[31:37] they can teach anybody about learning
[31:38] music and learning the piano and saying
[31:41] that when you ought to be music teachers
[31:43] I'm needing to teach you again music
[31:44] theory then to come back to the basic
[31:47] elements of things you have need that
[31:48] one teach you again which be the first
[31:51] principles of the Oracles of God
[31:54] and to become as such as have need of
[31:56] milk and not of strong meat now Paul is
[31:58] giving us mouthfuls of things that we
[32:00] could chew on that we could talk about
[32:02] that we could preach about this little
[32:04] little principles of milk principles of
[32:07] meat principles of maturing and being a
[32:08] babe for everyone that useth milk is
[32:10] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[32:11] for he is a babe but strong meat
[32:15] belonged to them that are full age even
[32:17] those who by reason of use have their
[32:19] senses exercised to discern both Good
[32:21] and Evil
[32:23] I was at all in View and we'll we'll
[32:25] move on to chapter six
[32:27] as we read this but he says that you
[32:30] need to be taught again the first
[32:32] principles of the Oracles of God the
[32:34] first principles are the beginning
[32:36] elements
[32:37] the first thing from which others in a
[32:40] series arise and he says the first
[32:41] principles of the Oracles of God the
[32:44] Oracles of God have a special
[32:45] significance and especially as it
[32:48] relates to what he's telling teaching
[32:50] the Hebrews he says you need to be
[32:52] taught at the beginning elements begin
[32:54] with the first things from which others
[32:56] in a series arise so when you see a
[32:58] series of things and you see things that
[32:59] have happened when you look at first
[33:01] principles you come back to find the
[33:03] first when it comes to pandemics it's
[33:05] patient zero right you come back to that
[33:07] and then even once you got there you
[33:09] want to find out where they got it and
[33:10] it's coming all the way back to the
[33:11] source to the origin the thing that
[33:13] began it all the first that others in a
[33:16] series others in a change arise from so
[33:18] if there's things that accompany
[33:20] salvation when he says there's things
[33:22] that accompany salvation he's using a
[33:24] language that ties back too the first
[33:26] principles of the Oracles of God because
[33:28] these are the things that arise in a
[33:30] series from these first these first
[33:33] principles
[33:34] the first principle is the Oracles of
[33:36] God this phrase first principles of the
[33:38] basic elements from which a composite
[33:40] arises or from which a whole comes to be
[33:44] if I could use the example of speech
[33:47] is you have speech or language
[33:50] the letters of the alphabet
[33:52] are the elements of language
[33:55] and when you begin to you want to teach
[33:57] a child to read
[33:58] you teach them the alphabet first
[34:03] am I getting that right okay
[34:06] I'm just the principal
[34:09] the the bill those are the building
[34:11] blocks those are the first principles of
[34:13] writing those are the first principles
[34:15] of reading is to know the letters their
[34:17] sounds right to your vowels and then you
[34:20] take it a step further and you take
[34:22] those building blocks and you begin to
[34:23] use in some disciplines phonics right
[34:26] and you look at a particular way and
[34:28] there's ways that you approach it but
[34:29] when you break it all down the alphabet
[34:31] is the building blocks it's the basic uh
[34:35] elements from which language or speech
[34:38] or reading and writing comes to be
[34:41] and so when he says the first prince was
[34:43] the beginning elements and that implies
[34:46] basic or Elementary elements of
[34:48] something
[34:49] now think about what Paul is saying then
[34:51] in this
[34:52] he's saying that because
[34:56] he says your Dole of hearing
[34:59] and I need to teach you again the first
[35:00] principles
[35:02] recognize what the consequence the cause
[35:05] and effect their failure to grasp the
[35:07] first principles
[35:09] their failure to fully appreciate the
[35:11] first principles
[35:13] and and to have them really establish
[35:15] kept them from understanding more of
[35:17] God's word
[35:19] if I come back to the example of music
[35:23] there's times when and I realize even
[35:25] maybe in our own families our children
[35:26] are taking piano lessons that they want
[35:28] to be able to play I want to play that
[35:30] song and I want to play that song and I
[35:32] want to be able to play this and I want
[35:33] to be able to play that and you know
[35:34] what they could do they could sit down
[35:35] and they could clunk it out and they
[35:37] could learn to play by ear and bang out
[35:40] though that particular Melody by plate
[35:42] because you could hear the notes but if
[35:44] you really want to be able to play that
[35:45] song let's start all over and learn
[35:47] whatever it is they learn right
[35:51] learn where C major is learn the hand
[35:54] position learn the posture learn the the
[35:56] scale and how things work together
[35:58] that's when you can really begin to
[36:00] learn a song because you'll be playing
[36:02] and instead of just
[36:04] done done done done done done
[36:09] and you're 65 years old they listen to
[36:12] what I can play right and you've been
[36:14] that's all you ever learned to do but
[36:16] then you you according to go wait wait
[36:17] what is that right there that goes
[36:19] somewhere that's right that's that right
[36:21] and they know just exactly how to hit it
[36:23] because they understand the building
[36:24] blocks
[36:25] and Paul is saying I we can't go further
[36:28] you're not just always supposed to be
[36:30] babes
[36:32] right Chopsticks and whatever it is we
[36:34] like to do there's this one song the
[36:36] Entertainer or something and it's like
[36:37] this there's this
[36:40] part and it's like anybody could do that
[36:43] if you really want to play learn the
[36:45] first principles
[36:47] this is what Paul is looking at it's
[36:48] what he's examining their failure to
[36:50] grasp the first principles kept them
[36:52] from really being able to mature in
[36:53] their gifts
[36:54] kept them from really being able to use
[36:56] salvation at its fullness kept them from
[36:58] really being able to grow and mature and
[37:00] they he said I want to share with you
[37:02] the mysteries of God I want to break
[37:03] open things to you but I can't because
[37:05] if I did it would be a mess to you
[37:07] because you don't understand first
[37:09] principles
[37:10] he says these things belong to them that
[37:12] are full age in other words they've
[37:13] matured they mature I'm just using some
[37:15] air some summary language they mature in
[37:18] their revelation of Jesus Christ they've
[37:19] matured to a greater understanding of
[37:21] Christ they have a higher revelation of
[37:23] the Mysteries
[37:24] so what what's been happening the
[37:26] they're using first principles right the
[37:30] understanding of it in their experience
[37:31] and it's not if there's it's not so much
[37:34] assumptions anymore it's not reasoning
[37:36] by analogy it's not this uh just plain
[37:38] music by ear it's not just saying what
[37:41] somebody else said it's not just oh
[37:42] brother Branham said this that sounds
[37:44] good I'll repeat it but it's going back
[37:46] to find what he actually taught maybe
[37:47] that's just a lesson to me as a minister
[37:49] you're going back to First principles
[37:51] then once you understand first
[37:52] principles you don't have just to
[37:54] re-preach what you hear other people
[37:55] preach when you understand first
[37:58] principles then you can really really
[37:59] get into knowing and understanding what
[38:02] God's word is what this message is
[38:05] for not careful all we will ever become
[38:08] as message Believers is an echo chamber
[38:10] of other people's ideas and even an echo
[38:13] chamber brother Branham but we want to
[38:15] understand the first principles
[38:17] have an understanding of these great
[38:19] truths and how they work
[38:23] you base if we could by deduction
[38:26] he's saying if they could grasp the
[38:28] first principles then they would be
[38:30] capable of understanding these deeper
[38:31] things
[38:32] that if you could if you had learned
[38:34] these and placed them if you understood
[38:36] these 12 basic notes if you had the
[38:38] right posture and hand position if you
[38:40] understood the science of cooking if you
[38:42] knew what ingredients you had to do this
[38:44] if you knew what temperature you had to
[38:45] do that if you could understand the
[38:47] basics right there's even things to
[38:49] understand about which way to cut meat
[38:51] and which cuts of meat you need to cook
[38:53] longer and which ones you need to do
[38:54] this and there's a science behind it
[38:56] twitch muscles and everything else
[38:59] that teach you how to understand the
[39:02] piece of meat the the thing that you're
[39:03] cooking
[39:13] okay so the the what I'm wanting to say
[39:16] we could deduce from this is that
[39:19] if we can have the first principles
[39:21] understood
[39:22] then you can understand deeper things
[39:25] that's when you can really really
[39:27] understand and know the deeper things
[39:29] now you can not have maybe the first
[39:31] principles down just right but start
[39:33] making a lot of assumptions and play the
[39:35] Mysteries by ear
[39:37] right and and there's there's still a
[39:40] beauty in it a reasoning by analogy
[39:42] isn't bad there's a lot of power that
[39:44] can come from that there's a lot of
[39:45] deducing that we can do there's a lot of
[39:47] assumptions we've made about the word of
[39:48] God and things that we kind of take and
[39:50] and have benefited us but don't you
[39:52] really want to be built up in the
[39:53] Oracles of God
[39:55] I've really built up in these things
[39:58] and so at the start the the Hebrews were
[40:00] very jealous excuse me very zealous for
[40:03] Christ they had this uh they were
[40:05] Earnest about things but now he's saying
[40:07] they have become dull
[40:09] there was a lot of enthusiasm at first
[40:11] but it began to wane and now they failed
[40:14] to advance they weren't in a place now
[40:16] where Paul's saying man the way you
[40:18] started out had you really laid the
[40:21] right foundation had you really grasped
[40:23] these first principles then you would be
[40:25] in a place now where I could open up to
[40:26] a further mystery but we kind of need to
[40:28] go back up and revisit these things
[40:30] because in the passage of time Your
[40:33] Enthusiasm has waned and you become dull
[40:35] of hearing and now I gotta feed you
[40:37] again milk to build you back up again
[40:41] and I will say that we will fail in
[40:43] possessing the full benefits of
[40:44] Salvation benefits of Salvation by not
[40:47] fully appreciating these first
[40:49] principles
[40:51] if we make the mistake at all of
[40:52] diminishing salvation in any way we can
[40:54] we're going to devalue Redemption
[40:57] if we redefine salvation it means
[40:59] something that it's not if we take it
[41:01] and we add other things to it if we
[41:02] don't really fully understand it and
[41:04] start building assumptions upon it we
[41:05] may be building false assumptions we may
[41:08] be building on the wrong kind of
[41:09] foundation and we may need to revisit it
[41:11] deconstruct it get all the pieces say
[41:13] you got all the pieces to the puzzle
[41:14] you're working in the right Fields
[41:16] you've got everything you need but you
[41:17] need to come back to First principles
[41:18] and look back at the word of God and
[41:22] identify the first principles
[41:24] because we cannot devalue salvation why
[41:26] because it is the power of the Gospel
[41:29] it is what the gospel produces it's like
[41:32] oh well that just sounds like a good
[41:33] Baptist message and all that just seems
[41:35] so simple and Elementary listen you're
[41:37] never going to get past it
[41:39] it's all salvation
[41:44] just Ponder the phrase Plan of Salvation
[41:47] and examine over these next few weeks
[41:50] considered even in the light of the the
[41:52] season that the the majority of the
[41:55] world is is having this Christmas season
[41:57] and if you research it back you'll find
[41:59] it has its roots and acknowledging the
[42:01] coming of Christ and the birth birth of
[42:03] Jesus Christ there this is this is
[42:06] something to think about during this
[42:07] time
[42:08] so Paul continues
[42:10] and
[42:13] it continues in Hebrews chapter 6.
[42:18] verses one to three
[42:24] therefore leaving the principles of the
[42:26] doctrine of Christ
[42:28] let us go on on unto perfection
[42:31] not Landing in the foundation of
[42:33] repentance now we recognize these first
[42:35] principles it says leaving therefore the
[42:37] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[42:39] us go on into Perfection so Perfection
[42:42] according to Hebrews 6 9 is in this
[42:44] chain of salvation
[42:46] things the company salvation let us go
[42:48] on to Perfection it's not you have
[42:50] salvation we're going to leave you here
[42:53] and and now medal in Perfection no
[42:55] perfection's in that chain
[42:57] that chain of Salvation he says not
[43:00] laying again the foundation of
[43:02] repentance so if there's a foundation
[43:03] that's upon which something else is
[43:05] built your Perfection is built on this
[43:08] Foundation
[43:09] we can't separate it out and say well
[43:10] this is just fodder for this group and
[43:12] this is for this is but this is for the
[43:13] bride no the the elect of God the saved
[43:17] of God are built upon this Foundation
[43:19] the foundation of repentance from dead
[43:21] works and a faith toward God so you have
[43:23] repentance Faith doctrine of baptisms
[43:25] baptism laying on of hands and of
[43:27] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[43:28] judgment and this will be due if God
[43:30] permit
[43:32] so in the book of Hebrews Paul is taking
[43:33] the fundamentals of the law even the
[43:36] very fundamentals of their first
[43:37] principles and showing how Christ
[43:40] fulfilled them
[43:41] something he's doing in each chapter
[43:42] he's taking things that were part of
[43:44] their elements part of their belief part
[43:45] of their faith and he's showing now the
[43:47] very fundamentals of the law point to
[43:49] Christ and Christ fulfilled him and so
[43:51] when he's talking here what he's showing
[43:53] is that these are the principles of the
[43:55] doctrines of Christ
[43:57] and these are the initial basic
[43:59] teachings of Christ you can actually go
[44:01] back and find that repentance Faith
[44:03] baptism laying out of hands resurrection
[44:05] and judgment all of these are the first
[44:07] principles of the doctrine of Christ and
[44:09] all these things Christ taught
[44:11] Christ in his teaching is going back to
[44:14] the building blocks of the law he's
[44:16] going back to the fundamental principles
[44:17] of Law and he's teaching on repentance
[44:19] and faith and baptisms laying out of
[44:21] hands the resurrection and judgment
[44:22] these are all basic teachings of Jesus
[44:25] Christ things that Christ taught but
[44:27] also the teachings of Christ
[44:31] and this going on into Perfection
[44:32] requires
[44:34] an understanding of these first
[44:36] principles of Christ
[44:39] the the idea of faith repentance Faith
[44:43] baptism laying on of hands Resurrection
[44:45] judgment these are all fundamental
[44:47] things
[44:48] you'll even find these very fundamental
[44:50] elements are part of in the book of Acts
[44:53] in Acts chapter two just refer to it
[44:55] real quick I'm going to be skipping some
[44:56] things brother John that and and I want
[44:59] to come back I'm coming back to
[45:00] Philippians so I'll just I'm just going
[45:02] to refer to Acts chapter 2 real quickly
[45:03] when Peter's preached on the day of
[45:05] Pentecost he begins after he establishes
[45:08] who Jesus is according to the very
[45:10] Prophecies of David he starts with the
[45:11] resurrection he says him have God raised
[45:13] up Jesus has raised him up and then as
[45:16] he preaches this sermon the men are
[45:17] perked in their heart and he says what
[45:19] what must we do in other words what must
[45:21] we do to be saved from this damnation
[45:23] that's to come he says repent and be
[45:25] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:26] every one of you and he says save
[45:29] yourselves from this untoward generation
[45:30] what is he preaching judgment
[45:33] and they that gladly received there's
[45:35] the belief there's the faith we're
[45:36] baptized and so you'll find these very
[45:39] building blocks which are part of the
[45:40] building blocks of Jesus ministry when
[45:42] he says go you into all the world preach
[45:44] the gospel he that believeth and is
[45:46] baptized shall be saved he that
[45:48] believeth not shall be damned he said
[45:50] verily verily except the man be born
[45:51] again he cannot enter the kingdom of God
[45:53] these are all the first doctrines of
[45:55] Jesus Christ
[45:56] and these are the very things that Paul
[45:58] is lifting up in Hebrews chapter six
[46:00] he's saying you need to come back to the
[46:02] first principles of the doctrine of
[46:04] Christ because he preached repentance he
[46:05] preached Faith he preached baptism he
[46:07] preached Lana hands he preached
[46:09] Resurrection he preached Eternal
[46:10] judgment these are all things that are
[46:12] there in the book of Acts at the Genesis
[46:14] of the church the very building blocks
[46:17] of Christianity
[46:19] if I could say this the first principle
[46:21] of the Pentecost
[46:22] or the first principle of the book of
[46:23] Acts as salvation through Jesus Christ
[46:26] and some people don't even have that
[46:28] right but they want to write a book of
[46:29] Acts
[46:30] but you don't have the building blocks
[46:31] for a book of Acts if you don't have
[46:33] salvation
[46:33] if you don't have salvation right you
[46:35] cannot Cobble together by ear a book of
[46:38] Acts
[46:41] it's just going to be an impersonation
[46:44] there was in music
[46:46] there was I think it was in Italy back
[46:48] in the Disco days and I I didn't have
[46:51] the eight tracker box set or anything
[46:52] but it's just something that in music
[46:55] theory I think is where it comes up is
[46:56] that I think it was in Italy a real
[46:58] popular Italian singer knew that the
[47:00] people in Italy would just fall for
[47:01] anything that sounded American and wrote
[47:04] an entire song that was just random
[47:06] English words
[47:07] and it became a major Billboard top
[47:10] number one hit in Italy and it was just
[47:12] nothing nothing made sense it was just
[47:14] English sounding gibberish
[47:17] and it became a huge hit
[47:19] I've just decided just described modern
[47:21] Christianity
[47:24] just a bunch of Christian sounding
[47:26] gibberish message sounding gibberish and
[47:29] it makes the number one billboard hit
[47:31] why because people don't understand the
[47:33] language
[47:34] they just like the sound they want to
[47:37] know that it came from Brother Branham
[47:38] they want to know that it came from the
[47:40] Bible they want to believe it's this
[47:41] Rambo idea of Jesus or whatever it is
[47:43] and it doesn't make sense
[47:47] whew
[47:51] but the very first principles of the
[47:53] book of Acts is salvation through Jesus
[47:54] Christ
[47:55] brother Brown says in Revelations
[47:57] chapter 4 part 3 says after Pentecost
[47:59] they wrote a book of what acts of the
[48:01] Holy Ghost acts a-c-t-s is that right
[48:03] what does the Act start off with the
[48:06] first thing to enter into salvation
[48:09] Acts 2 38.
[48:11] there's your first principle where does
[48:13] the book of Acts begin Acts 2 38 where
[48:15] does it all start Acts 2 38 this is what
[48:18] Paul is pointing to in Hebrews chapter
[48:20] 5. this is what Paul is pointing to in
[48:21] Hebrews chapter 6 the first principles
[48:25] I and I believe that though Paul is
[48:28] saying it to the the Hebrew church this
[48:31] is something that would be instructed to
[48:33] the individual Hebrew
[48:35] because these are things that we must be
[48:37] certain of
[48:39] as we're looking at this together and
[48:41] we're identifying this together in such
[48:44] a way towards not I'm not trying to
[48:46] preach to you a message to Salvation in
[48:48] order to get you saved but we're
[48:49] standing together as Believers arm and
[48:51] arm heart together we see eye to eye
[48:53] we're standing together in this and
[48:55] we're looking down into the word of God
[48:56] together at this beautiful subject of
[48:58] Salvation And The Joy that's connected
[49:00] with it and we're asking ourselves we're
[49:03] questions to look at it and understand
[49:04] it better
[49:06] in Philippians chapter 2 verses 12 and
[49:08] 13.
[49:10] Paul says
[49:13] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[49:15] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[49:17] now much more in my absence
[49:20] work out your own salvation with fear
[49:22] and trembling
[49:23] it it strikes me I say even more so now
[49:26] than I had earlier how that this is what
[49:30] the Hebrews ought to been able to do
[49:32] Paul is saying when you ought to be
[49:35] teachers in other words you don't need
[49:36] me anymore
[49:38] but you can teach you've arrived at that
[49:40] stage now where you can even help others
[49:42] Advance he is telling the Philippians
[49:44] that I won't be there so now in my
[49:47] absence you've got to work out your own
[49:49] salvation with fear and trembling
[49:51] you're now at this park that this ready
[49:53] to work out your own salvation with fear
[49:54] and trembling for it as God which
[49:56] worketh in you both to Will and to do of
[49:58] his good pleasure
[50:00] out
[50:01] maybe it didn't strike me this way when
[50:03] I was putting uh these things together
[50:05] last week but now
[50:07] now maybe it there's this part where
[50:09] there's this really really hard pivot
[50:12] but I'm still wanting to go down this
[50:13] line of considering salvation on its
[50:16] basic level
[50:17] but he says work out your own salvation
[50:19] with fear and trembling
[50:21] salvation is an individual affair with
[50:23] man and God Alone
[50:26] this is something that you have to have
[50:29] anchored this is something that you have
[50:31] to have the first principles it's not
[50:33] enough to just be able to go to the
[50:35] church website and look up the mission
[50:36] statement and see the first principles
[50:38] of the church and say oh they believe in
[50:39] God the Father they believe in God the
[50:41] son they believe in the Holy Ghost and
[50:43] these three are one and just make sure
[50:44] that the catechism's all right and make
[50:46] sure everything's just lettered just
[50:47] right not not enough you can't find
[50:49] safety in the church
[50:51] you're not gonna be able to find safety
[50:52] in a denomination there's only one place
[50:54] where God has put his name and that's
[50:56] and that's under the shed blood it's in
[50:58] Jesus Christ and only individuals can
[51:00] enter therein this church as a as a
[51:03] local congregation cannot be put under
[51:06] that in such a way toward if you manage
[51:08] to walk in through these doors at 3736
[51:11] West Walhalla Phoenix Arizona now you
[51:12] got the address then there's a way
[51:14] there's no way that in just doing that
[51:16] do you come under the token
[51:19] this is something individual this is
[51:21] something that you've got to work out
[51:22] your own salvation with fear and
[51:24] trembling
[51:26] secure the Salvation which Christ has
[51:28] purchased
[51:30] and aim at the destiny of it
[51:33] so Paul is saying I think it's so
[51:35] awesome work out your own salvation with
[51:37] fear and trembling it's not just merely
[51:39] make sure you're saved but it's work it
[51:42] out
[51:43] let it be something that comes forth let
[51:46] it be something that you not only have
[51:47] secured I've secured my salvation but
[51:50] now aim at the destiny of it aim at the
[51:53] fullness of it implore yourselves on the
[51:55] things which accompany salvation what is
[51:57] it for it is God which work is in you
[52:00] both too willing to do of his good
[52:02] pleasure working out your salvation with
[52:04] fear and trembling is not in itself just
[52:06] making sure you're saved yeah you better
[52:09] do that you better be sure of it you
[52:11] better have that anchor but once you
[52:13] know you're saved don't lose your Edge
[52:17] once you know you're saved take that
[52:20] salvation and get to the first
[52:21] principles of it want to really know how
[52:23] it works what it is what is it for and
[52:26] Paul gives us this beautiful secret he
[52:27] says for it is God which worketh in you
[52:30] I need to work out my own salvation that
[52:33] doesn't mean you're going to earn it
[52:34] doesn't mean you're going to somehow
[52:35] figure it out but now that you are
[52:37] possessors of it now that it assured
[52:39] that no that in order to work it out
[52:41] it's God that works in you both the
[52:42] willing to do it is good pleasure
[52:46] God working in you his will this is the
[52:49] this is what a company salvation
[52:51] biller Brandman the sermon
[52:52] identification says but this Plan of
[52:54] Salvation is an individual affair with
[52:56] you
[52:57] speaking in tongues as a gift of God
[53:00] dancing in the spirit is the presence
[53:02] and glory of God
[53:04] but for you to let your character be
[53:06] mold into the image of God that he
[53:08] projects himself and you are his Idol
[53:10] walking on the earth the expressed image
[53:12] of him
[53:14] The Plan of Salvation is not tongues
[53:18] it's not dancing in the spirit but your
[53:20] character being molded in the image of
[53:22] God toward you are the expressed image
[53:23] of God
[53:24] now there's things there's tongues
[53:26] they're a gift of God death in the
[53:28] spirit is the presence and glory of God
[53:29] but the Plan of Salvation is an
[53:31] individual Affair where your character
[53:32] is molded into the image of God where he
[53:35] projects himself the expressed image of
[53:38] him he says you're his Idol walking on
[53:39] Earth
[53:42] this is where we can see that the first
[53:43] principle of Pentecost
[53:45] first principle of the book of Acts of
[53:47] Salvation through Jesus Christ
[53:48] foreign
[53:51] Acts Chapter 4 verses 10 to 12.
[53:55] I'll try to go very quickly here
[53:57] I don't want to keep you long
[53:59] I know it's already been a long week and
[54:00] it's Sunday the first day of the week
[54:03] Acts Chapter 4 verses 10 to 12. I think
[54:06] I'll be able to get to everything though
[54:07] today brother John thanks for keeping up
[54:09] with me there
[54:10] in Acts Chapter 4 verses 10 11 and 12.
[54:13] here's Peter once again coming back to
[54:16] these first principles the very things
[54:17] that Paul pointed back to we often speak
[54:19] of the Rivalry between Paul and Peter
[54:21] but the Paul spoke things and taught
[54:23] things that come right back to the
[54:25] things that Peter's teaching in the book
[54:26] of Acts it says be it known to you all
[54:28] and to all the people of Israel that by
[54:30] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[54:32] whom you crucified him God raised from
[54:34] the dead even by him does this man stand
[54:36] here before you whole
[54:40] now there's some that have taken in
[54:42] learning Christianity by ear they've
[54:45] made it the name of Jesus of Christ of
[54:47] Nazareth to where it's just this
[54:48] nomination or appellation it's just the
[54:50] name of Jesus Christ and so it's just
[54:52] Jesus right just Jesus Christ and they
[54:56] just and their their whole idea of
[54:57] speaking Jesus is just literally saying
[54:59] the name
[55:01] and they think that that's that's what
[55:04] does it but he when he says that by the
[55:07] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth there's
[55:09] to get to the fundamental elements of
[55:11] that the core of that and the first
[55:13] principles of that is not just to say
[55:15] the name but to know the nature behind
[55:17] it
[55:18] the power and the authority of it he
[55:21] says this is the stone which was said it
[55:23] not of you Builders which has become the
[55:25] head of the corner now that would be a
[55:28] shocking statement
[55:29] to the Jews
[55:31] but he says this is the foundational
[55:33] principle
[55:35] this is the first principle of the law
[55:37] this is the beginning
[55:40] and this is what you rejected but now
[55:42] he's becoming the head of the corner
[55:45] neither is there salvation in any other
[55:47] any other than Jesus Christ for there's
[55:50] none other name under Heaven given among
[55:52] men whereby we must be saved
[55:57] you talk about first principles there's
[55:59] no other name under Heaven whereby men
[56:01] can be saved whereby we must be saved we
[56:04] can put it this way Jesus Christ is the
[56:06] only way to be saved
[56:08] it is exclusive salvation there is no
[56:12] salvation outside of Jesus Christ
[56:16] this is the these are the first
[56:18] principles
[56:19] now we could even pose these questions
[56:21] and we'll just pose them as we close uh
[56:23] hopefully run through these last few
[56:24] things pretty quickly here
[56:27] but if Jesus Christ is the only
[56:29] salvation
[56:30] who is Jesus Christ
[56:34] how much thought do we even give to that
[56:38] if it's the only name whereby we must be
[56:40] saved what does save mean we've talked
[56:41] about it already a little bit
[56:43] like what does it even mean at the end
[56:45] of the day
[56:46] how how is it that I am saved
[56:49] and they these may be a lot of the
[56:51] questions that we begin to ask ourselves
[56:56] when we're confronted with this truth
[56:58] that salvation is only through Christ
[57:00] but these are the foundational first
[57:03] principles that Paul is pointing to
[57:05] salvation by Christ
[57:08] he says in Romans 5 11 and not only so
[57:11] but we also joy in God through our Lord
[57:14] Jesus Christ
[57:15] by whom we have now received the
[57:17] atonement
[57:18] we joy and God where is our joy come
[57:20] from where is our rejoicing in God it's
[57:22] through our Lord Jesus Christ because
[57:24] it's through Jesus Christ that we have
[57:25] received the atonement for a Jew to be
[57:27] writing this is saying that all that the
[57:29] law spoke to all that the law pointed to
[57:31] is now in my possession through Jesus
[57:33] Christ and that is my joy that is my
[57:36] rejoicing through Jesus Christ salvation
[57:38] by Christ and Christ Alone
[57:41] these are the first principles
[57:44] these are the things that we must have
[57:46] as President says it's an individual
[57:48] Affair between you and God to understand
[57:50] these first principles to work out our
[57:52] own salvation through fear and trembling
[57:54] is to know that it's been secured
[57:55] through Jesus Christ and then aim at the
[57:58] product of it
[58:00] I came across this statement last week
[58:01] that uh just I didn't know where exactly
[58:04] where we'd fit in this morning I just I
[58:06] just put it in because I wanted to end
[58:07] with this brother in the message third
[58:08] says oh are you enthused about your
[58:11] experience with Christ
[58:13] oh are you enthused about your
[58:16] experience with Christ when you become
[58:18] dull of hearing maybe it's through the
[58:20] repetition of things when you become
[58:21] dull of hearing maybe the melody doesn't
[58:23] excite you anymore you ever had a song
[58:25] that gets played too much and you really
[58:26] really loved it at first but by the time
[58:28] you heard it for the umpty time you
[58:29] don't like it anymore but man at one
[58:31] time you really really loved it you've
[58:33] lost your enthusiasm for it
[58:35] it's just become background noises
[58:37] become too common there's a lot of
[58:39] things that we have to realize that
[58:40] maybe we've allowed the echo maybe we've
[58:42] allowed the assumptions maybe we've
[58:44] allowed all the plane by ear uh to
[58:47] bother us if I I just feel I should be
[58:49] better at music and understand this
[58:51] better but there's things that you
[58:53] listen to as a layperson there's things
[58:55] that you hear and you really really love
[58:57] a song and you really think it's great
[58:58] and you really like that hook but let a
[59:01] musician listen to it
[59:03] and sometimes I'll be like oh
[59:05] that's bad
[59:07] that's not good at all I had somebody
[59:09] say one time we really really new music
[59:11] and a very very talented gift and said
[59:13] all Christian artists are just those who
[59:15] aren't good enough to make it in in the
[59:16] secular world
[59:18] and so you start listening
[59:20] yeah maybe this is kind of crummy music
[59:21] right but I mean they're getting more
[59:23] and more talented more and more gifted
[59:25] but the point is there's things that you
[59:27] listen to and you just kind of like the
[59:28] Rhythm or the hook right
[59:30] but then to a musician they could hear
[59:32] something be like what do you notice
[59:34] what they just did they're like yeah no
[59:37] no just said you know join to the world
[59:39] yeah
[59:40] but then you hear something different
[59:42] Arrangements different Melodies
[59:43] different notes it means something to
[59:45] somebody who understands the first
[59:47] principles of it
[59:50] that understands what's behind it and
[59:52] the thoughts behind it says are you
[59:54] enthused about your experience with
[59:56] Christ if we're not maybe it's because
[59:58] we don't really understand the first
[59:59] principles
[1:00:01] maybe we just learned it by ear and
[1:00:03] after a while it gets old to us
[1:00:05] and we're no longer able to use the same
[1:00:07] basic truths to keep producing beautiful
[1:00:09] melodies
[1:00:11] because we only learned the recipe all
[1:00:13] we're able to do is keep making the same
[1:00:15] thing over and over and God said a
[1:00:16] prophet God said a prophet God said a
[1:00:17] prophet or Jesus is coming one day Jesus
[1:00:19] is coming one day and all we can ever do
[1:00:21] is cook the same meal over and over
[1:00:23] again but we never got to the real core
[1:00:24] the real fundamental ingredients of it
[1:00:27] so that we could begin to put together
[1:00:28] things
[1:00:29] when I preach red here in a rainbow
[1:00:30] trout it didn't say that we only needed
[1:00:32] to eat rainbow trout I got a text
[1:00:33] message but Philip asked how the trout
[1:00:35] was I never responded because I didn't
[1:00:36] have trout
[1:00:39] but it's there's so much more to be
[1:00:41] enjoyed
[1:00:42] now when we say that it doesn't mean
[1:00:44] you're going to run out and find a new
[1:00:45] ingredient somewhere but with what we've
[1:00:47] been given if we could understand better
[1:00:50] the first principle understand what
[1:00:51] we've been given it's endless what this
[1:00:54] beautiful combination can be in melody
[1:00:56] in music and Harmony and a Great
[1:00:59] Masterpiece whether it be music or
[1:01:01] whether it be feasting think about all
[1:01:03] the things that we have when we can
[1:01:04] understand the first principles and then
[1:01:06] you begin to say I'll never lose my
[1:01:09] taste for that I'll never lose it why I
[1:01:12] will always remain enthused because
[1:01:14] that's the beauty of understanding
[1:01:16] something in its truth in its
[1:01:18] fundamentals and that and and therefore
[1:01:20] in its depth toward now I will never how
[1:01:23] can I lose my enthusiasm for something
[1:01:26] that's endlessly enthusiastic
[1:01:29] that's endlessly inspiring that's
[1:01:31] endlessly enthusing
[1:01:33] and if I could say this coming to the
[1:01:35] title for today the first principle
[1:01:38] Christ is the first principle
[1:01:43] this is our Bedrock this is our
[1:01:45] fundamental foundation in Revelations
[1:01:47] chapter 1 verse 8 he says I am Alpha and
[1:01:49] Omega the beginning and the ending saith
[1:01:51] the Lord which is and which was and
[1:01:52] which is to come the almighty whether
[1:01:55] we're talking about music whether we're
[1:01:56] talking about food within uh as ways of
[1:01:59] example there's things that'll always be
[1:02:01] the core elements
[1:02:02] you ever heard of the Holy Trinity and
[1:02:04] cajun cooking
[1:02:06] yeah ever had it
[1:02:09] isn't out
[1:02:11] and I said these are the three main
[1:02:13] ingredients they have to be there and
[1:02:15] it's the same in certain things where
[1:02:16] you have to have certain ingredients
[1:02:17] they're always fundamental it's not this
[1:02:19] like in Texas they got this bravado that
[1:02:21] if it has a bean in it it can't be chili
[1:02:23] right I used to be that way I'm not So
[1:02:26] Much legalistic Anymore
[1:02:28] but there's these ideas not chili yeah
[1:02:30] you can't have a peanut and chili and if
[1:02:32] this is you you call that this you call
[1:02:34] this that why because there's these
[1:02:35] rules and these constructs now when it
[1:02:38] comes to the word of God there's
[1:02:39] fundamental truths and there's things he
[1:02:41] says that I am Alpha and Omega the
[1:02:44] beginning and ending which is which was
[1:02:46] which is to come here he's at the center
[1:02:49] of it all
[1:02:51] that if you can begin to understand him
[1:02:53] and see him this is how you can see
[1:02:55] Christ in every verse of the Bible this
[1:02:57] is how you can look up and begin to see
[1:02:58] Christ in your brothers and sisters when
[1:03:00] you begin to understand the first
[1:03:02] principles
[1:03:04] when we just picked up somebody else's
[1:03:05] personality when we're just following a
[1:03:07] man and a man's ideas then we're always
[1:03:09] looking for that man that idea of the
[1:03:11] man this idea of the person this idea of
[1:03:12] the symbolism and the ideology and
[1:03:14] that's what we're looking for and if we
[1:03:16] don't see that particular makeup in
[1:03:17] somebody we just reject them but when
[1:03:19] you come to know Christ then you can
[1:03:21] begin to see Christ in so many other
[1:03:22] places
[1:03:25] but the Brandman referring to verse 11
[1:03:27] he says the first and the last the Alpha
[1:03:29] and Omega that's all of it
[1:03:32] that's the one true God the voice and
[1:03:34] the word of God reality and Truth is at
[1:03:36] hand let me say first principle
[1:03:40] that when it all comes when you're going
[1:03:42] to whittle it all down let's just we
[1:03:43] look at our lives today and say all
[1:03:45] right let's just start now and let's
[1:03:46] break it all down if we're really going
[1:03:47] to get aggressive it's going to go all
[1:03:48] the way back to in the beginning was the
[1:03:50] word
[1:03:52] and you come all the way back that's the
[1:03:53] one thing that we can say we know is
[1:03:54] truth
[1:03:56] the Alpha and Omega the begin and the
[1:03:58] end the first and the last that's all of
[1:04:00] it reality and Truth is at hand
[1:04:04] and in the same chapter
[1:04:06] John writes I think it's verse five and
[1:04:07] he hath made us Kings and Priests
[1:04:10] this is the introductory Revelation
[1:04:12] that's coming that's coming forth at
[1:04:14] this
[1:04:16] yep verse 5 verse six Revelations 1 6
[1:04:19] and he hath made as Kings and Priests
[1:04:20] unto God and his father here's here's
[1:04:24] the
[1:04:25] the bubbling forth of seeing this great
[1:04:28] image of Christ
[1:04:29] and brother bam takes this in chapter
[1:04:31] one of the church age book he says he
[1:04:32] hath made us
[1:04:34] oh there are certain truths that we need
[1:04:36] to emphasize
[1:04:38] and this is one of them
[1:04:41] he
[1:04:42] he hath made us
[1:04:45] salvation is his doing
[1:04:48] salvation is of the Lord I believe this
[1:04:50] is part of the truth that must be
[1:04:52] emphasized he says oh there are certain
[1:04:53] truths we need to emphasize this is one
[1:04:55] of them what is it he hath made us what
[1:04:58] does it mean what are we what does it
[1:04:59] come down to Salvation is his duty when
[1:05:01] it says he hath made us if they get down
[1:05:03] to First principles we're going to say
[1:05:05] he hath
[1:05:07] it's his doing salvation it's his doing
[1:05:09] salvation is of the Lord
[1:05:12] salvation is the Lord's that's what the
[1:05:14] scripture says to us that salvation is
[1:05:17] the Lord I I took some things out just
[1:05:19] even and maybe I'll just sow the seed
[1:05:21] for the future service when when Jesus
[1:05:24] what does it mean
[1:05:27] Jehovah is salvation
[1:05:30] that's what even that's what it means
[1:05:32] Jehovah is salvation this is who that
[1:05:36] the Lord's salvation is the Lord's
[1:05:39] salvation is his doing salvation is of
[1:05:41] the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for
[1:05:44] purpose oh I love this getting down to
[1:05:46] the root getting down the core of the
[1:05:47] first principles he's redeemed us for a
[1:05:49] purpose he bought us for purpose in
[1:05:52] other words it's just not well I'm saved
[1:05:54] well you're saved what are you saved
[1:05:55] from oh I'm saved well I'm safe from
[1:05:57] this well what for why he's done it for
[1:06:00] a purpose
[1:06:01] we are King spiritual Kings oh we're
[1:06:04] going to be Kings upon the Earth with
[1:06:05] him when he sits on his throne but now
[1:06:07] we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over
[1:06:09] a spiritual Kingdom
[1:06:13] notice the emphasis on the first
[1:06:15] principle
[1:06:17] it's God himself
[1:06:18] he's the immutable truth he's the
[1:06:20] foundation musicians if he'd come what
[1:06:23] is it nehemiah's claims a beautiful
[1:06:24] story of the books being opened the
[1:06:26] revealing of the word restoration of the
[1:06:28] word back to the Jews he says the joy of
[1:06:30] the Lord is your strength
[1:06:32] at the open of the word when there was
[1:06:34] weeping there was sadness there was
[1:06:35] despondency there was this horror at
[1:06:38] what had transpired but he says the joy
[1:06:40] of the Lord is your strength
[1:06:45] I'm wanting this to be
[1:06:47] before us as we venture into these next
[1:06:49] few Services I have I kind of have a
[1:06:51] little bit of a road map laid out I'm
[1:06:53] just open to however the Lord would lead
[1:06:54] open to whatever opportunities there are
[1:06:57] so you just keep praying but maybe over
[1:07:00] these next several services this is
[1:07:02] something as we build up
[1:07:03] to the to the this Christmas Even
[1:07:05] Christmas time that there's the joy
[1:07:09] the joy of salvation
[1:07:11] he says the joy of the Lord is your
[1:07:14] strength
[1:07:16] the mess of the token let this be before
[1:07:18] you and in your hearts whether it be a
[1:07:20] dark time sister Elizabeth was sharing
[1:07:22] with me just the difference in prices
[1:07:23] this year over Thanksgiving we see it in
[1:07:25] gas prices maybe we don't notice it in
[1:07:27] other places but she says usually this
[1:07:29] time of year she can find a 10 pound bag
[1:07:32] of potatoes for 98 cents and she had to
[1:07:34] buy a five pound bag for five bucks
[1:07:37] and it I've not it wasn't a moment of
[1:07:40] weakness but I felt this horror
[1:07:43] of how difficult things can be
[1:07:46] now how hard it is on a lot of us when
[1:07:49] they've counted on potatoes being 98
[1:07:51] cents for 10 pounds
[1:07:53] and now they're getting half as much for
[1:07:55] five times as much
[1:07:57] how that can kind of creep in and people
[1:08:00] are looking at the income and they're
[1:08:01] looking at the outgo
[1:08:03] and they're wondering how are we going
[1:08:05] to make it work
[1:08:06] right
[1:08:08] how are we going to how are we going to
[1:08:09] make things work how are things going to
[1:08:11] go forward what does the future look
[1:08:13] like don't find your joy in those things
[1:08:15] brother Brandon said God is your joy
[1:08:18] message the token God is your strength
[1:08:20] knowing the message knowing the truth
[1:08:22] that's our sufficiency
[1:08:24] he's my all-sufficiency
[1:08:26] and him all things I have need of is in
[1:08:28] him that's our strength
[1:08:31] My Help Cometh From The Lord
[1:08:33] you Christians Look to Him for your joy
[1:08:37] Look to Him for your strength
[1:08:39] look for him for your happiness he is my
[1:08:42] peace he is my joy he is my love he is
[1:08:46] my life could you even Echo that from
[1:08:49] your own heart today could you even I
[1:08:51] didn't just even invite you now to
[1:08:52] repeat this refrain yourself from where
[1:08:55] you sit today find something in here
[1:08:57] that you can say he is my peace can you
[1:09:00] say that he is my peace he is my joy he
[1:09:03] is my love he is my life
[1:09:07] that that's what I'm gonna derive in
[1:09:09] this time when they're saying peace on
[1:09:11] Earth and Joy to the World he is my joy
[1:09:14] he is my peace
[1:09:17] he's my love he's my life
[1:09:21] and that's the joy
[1:09:23] of salvation
[1:09:25] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:28] he is my love he is my life
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:34] the first principles
[1:09:39] do we have them
[1:09:41] is there more we can learn about them
[1:09:44] there's more that I could understand
[1:09:45] about them is there a way that I could
[1:09:47] take
[1:09:49] just this thought kind of escapes me but
[1:09:52] just this picture
[1:09:53] somehow God was showing me to where
[1:09:57] there's just God is God wants to bring
[1:10:00] himself into our view
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:04] and I'm so glad that he has allowed
[1:10:06] himself and how great he is to be
[1:10:09] manifested in certain basic fundamental
[1:10:11] truths
[1:10:13] that if we could know them and
[1:10:15] understand them
[1:10:17] and and be able to properly place them
[1:10:19] then it's just it begins to enrich
[1:10:22] and further places in the body of Christ
[1:10:26] and just as a way of
[1:10:29] I'm not trying to backtrack on anything
[1:10:31] but it's just point of emphasis
[1:10:35] whether it be Aristotle's use of analogy
[1:10:39] to understand things
[1:10:41] you can know truth that way
[1:10:43] there's things you can learn through
[1:10:45] that
[1:10:46] plane by ear there's a lot of people who
[1:10:48] play by ear and they're phenomenally
[1:10:50] gifted
[1:10:51] and you'd never know they just play by
[1:10:52] ear
[1:10:53] but there's certain limitations
[1:10:56] right anybody play by ear no certain
[1:11:00] limitations
[1:11:01] and so in referring those things it's no
[1:11:03] way it might Terry not that there's no
[1:11:05] good there's no good in that there's no
[1:11:06] good in this but but there are things
[1:11:08] that God wants us to know
[1:11:11] told us to play by ear
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:18] personally and be familiar with it and
[1:11:21] if there's a lot of things in our lives
[1:11:22] and maybe this is just echoing some of
[1:11:24] the similar burdens that we've had in
[1:11:25] some of the recent services that you
[1:11:27] whether it be the kind of the thrust
[1:11:28] behind red herring or rainbow trout
[1:11:31] maybe there's a lot of things that we've
[1:11:34] kind of just quickly we haven't really
[1:11:35] mastered we haven't really we've just
[1:11:37] kind of moved on from we've made a lot
[1:11:39] of assumptions and we find ourselves
[1:11:40] this great big huge economy and it's way
[1:11:43] too fast for us and we're not able to
[1:11:44] keep up maybe we just need to slow down
[1:11:46] a little bit
[1:11:47] in this economy of God because there's
[1:11:49] great truths there's things happening
[1:11:50] beautiful season to be living in It's a
[1:11:52] Wonderful the greatest of all ages this
[1:11:54] is our golden hour this is our golden
[1:11:56] this is a bright age but if it all
[1:11:57] doesn't seem to make sense and there's
[1:11:58] all these different voices just take a
[1:12:00] step back and kind of come back to First
[1:12:01] principles
[1:12:03] kind of get built back up in these
[1:12:05] things again we remind ourselves of them
[1:12:07] so that we can begin to look out
[1:12:09] and with an eye of understanding begin
[1:12:11] to experience things that maybe we've
[1:12:13] thought we've always understood let them
[1:12:16] become more vibrant and More Alive
[1:12:19] surely this is something we could do
[1:12:21] together
[1:12:22] [Music]
