TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Matthew chapter 2 I'm going to read verses 1 to 12. now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem so beginning their Journey saying where is he that is born King of the Jews if we have seen his star in the east and we are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem and the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of these shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise men and quieter them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went be before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary's mother and they fell down and worshiped him and when they'd opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way amen we desire that God would bless these words in this scripture you can be seated I'm going to finish this series on the joy of Salvation tonight there's a lot of subject matter maybe that we studied and had upon our heart we know that there's always a place to pick up on some of these things later but we're just going to title this one tonight rejoice in the gift rejoice in the gift and there's maybe different ways we're going to phrase it rejoicing in his gift or rejoicing in his presence but rejoicing in the gift and we'll just share some things with you that'll kind of make that title a little bit clearer but some of the things that we've been emphasizing in this series on the joy of Salvation is that our joy is in Christ and then when our joy is in Christ he enthuses us with the joy and gladness that is then something that he's behind it becomes a strength to us and we want to have our joy and our happiness in the right things one of the things that's been important to me right now is just because this is this holiday season and the time when people are thinking about the birth of Christ a time when many believe that Jesus was actually born and been wanting just to remind us of not only our season of Joy but the Genesis of our gladness what what initiates it what brings it to us what makes us happy what we rejoice in and so there's a lot of things that we've thought about in terms of the holiday season and how that's kind of a type or parallel you'll see how some of the services we've ministered have maybe been a little bit connected to Holiday themes but Christmas is a time that is marked by the theme of joy and you hear Joy is mentioned quite a bit and also gift giving and I would say that though the real meaning of those things has been lost there's still a truth to it there's even a truth to why gifts were exchanged there's a truth to why Joy has such a a place in the the lore in the language of the Christmas season and so even though some of it's been lost we can go back to the events of Christ's birth and see that Joy is one of those principal themes and this is a gift that God sent to the Earth so at the outset I'm kind of established some of these things related to Joy and then begin to build this idea of God giving a gift and what it means to us in this time we've read this through a number of services in Luke Chapter 2 verses 10 to 11. I will say at the outset my brother John to warned you I put very few scriptures very few quotes in there just so you could enjoy the service so welcome back it's good to have you back and uh just felt I did want maybe to be any kind of distractions because I do have a lot to get to but there's a few key places maybe uh that if you want to just relax brother John and lean into US enjoy it nobody's going to complain if they don't get a slide but if you catch it there there's only just a few there that will share but in Luke Chapter 2 verses 10 and 11 it says and the angel said unto them here's the angel appearing to the Shepherds fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy so this is news that is going to bring them it's a gospel of great joy something that is to enthuse them and excite them which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord there's the joy of our Salvation going to be bringing Good Tidings of great joy because there's a savior that is born and which is Christ the lord and remember the angel when it came to Mary and even or p appeared unto Joseph and said what his name would be his name would be Jesus which is Jehovah is salvation and so this is the savior is Jesus Jehovah is salvation and the announcement at his birth and the Shepherds come and view him there in the manger it is the savior and this to them is a great joy ought to be a great joy to them and so the Christmas season is one that is associated with the theme of joy gladness and mirth and rejoicing and they call it jolly and everyone's supposedly happy and some people remark that they like this time of year because people maybe try a little bit harder to be nice and people start feeling a little bit lifted up because they're expecting great Christmas gifts and then when they don't get what they want December 26th I think there's a reason why the Canadians call It Boxing Day right did I get that right I don't know maybe I'm thinking of the wrong kind of boxing but there's a maybe a letdown and the joy is gone but there's a real reason for Joy which is permanent as things that we can rejoice in I'm I'll share these with you maybe so we could kind of get some of these Christmas tunes in our mind brother Michael didn't seeing any this year and so maybe next year we'll work them in but think of some of the songs that we sing related to Christmas and how Joy is mentioned and Joy to the World the Lord is come and this and the song Angels We Have Heard On High it says echoing their joyous strains and the song Hark the Herald Angels Sing it's joyful all ye nations rise join the Triumph of the sky so it's Joy to the World Echo your joyous strains and uh rise joyfully and Oh Come All Ye Faithful it's oh come on you Faithful joyful and triumphant and the song O come O come Emmanuel which has kind of that that Hebrew a rhythm to it and sound it still is Rejoice Rejoice Emmanuel shall come to you o Israel this is a rejoicing and then the song Oh Holy Night a thrill of Hope the weary World rejoices that's what was Dawning at the birth of Christ that's why so many of these hymns that were written by these inspired songwriters are calling from a theme of Joy because the world sat in darkness but now at the birth of Christ it's a time to be joyful it's a time to Rejoice it's a time to Triumph it's a thrill of Hope because a great light is sprung up these are the themes associated with God sending his son even at his birth they're in a Manger though in that present State he can't conquer sin in that state as of yet he cannot declare the father just in a Manger alone just in that scene being captured as a babe but yet this is a great happening this is the beginning of his coming this is something extremely important and the four even the Forerunner of Christ I appreciate the tremendous pool tonight I just feel so comfortable and in Luke chapter 1 verse 14. and it is in his promise to Zacharias it says and thou shalt have joy in gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth speaking of even John John being the Forerunner of this joy that has come into the world John being a forerunner of Jehovah is a Salvation the Forerunner Jesus Christ Zacharias is Promised joy and gladness why because it's foreshadowing Christ something connected with Christ and then in Luke chapter 1 verse 44 when when Mary visits her cousin um Elizabeth and and she mentions you know the even the mention of the Savior to be born she says for lo as soon as thy voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears The Babe leaped in my womb for joy so John the Forerunner promised his promised to bring joy and gladness to his parents and many will rejoice in the birth of the Forerunner and now just at the salutation from Mary The Babe John leaps in the womb of his mother for Joy all right because it's in anticipation of the gift that Mary is carrying it's this theme of Joy being excited and it's a joy that is in anticipation of something coming it's an anticipation for things that are going to uh resolve things and satisfy things and save things so it's a joy and something future coming but when Christ comes it's not a future Joy it's a present Joy and this is what's being expressed at the time of his birth and we see this theme of Joy Joy Joy to the World Joy rejoicing at his birth the baby leaping for Joy at the salutation of Mary because of Christ that is coming and then to see this as a gift in Luke chapter 2 verse 7 it says and she brought forth her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes laid him in a Manger because there is no room for them in the end and brother Branham takes that wrapping of Christ and calls it God's wrapped gift this wrapping of the child at his birth he calls it God's wrapped gift he says the greatest thing was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it God himself wrapped him oh his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world it's a different way of looking at Christmas right God wrapped himself in this Christmas package and sent it to the world that's what's envisioned even in this image of Christ being wrapped in swaddling clothes and think oh that's not really good wrapping paper we have in our family we exchange gifts amongst one of us and sister Elizabeth is really really good I admire a gift someone could wrap a gift right be able to fold it just right and everything lines up just neat no matter how much I try and the rest of us try in the family we always know which gifts are Elizabeth's this one's gonna wrap the worst and and so in that way I'm a much like God who wrapped the most wonderful gift it may be a way that's not very appealing so I appreciate being Godlike that way it looks like swaddling clothes it's uneven it's not fit for the gift that it contains but yet this is God's way of wrapping the greatest thing ever wrapped in human flesh God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world and what happened when those Shepherds were told there's going to be this babe born you're going to find them laying in a manger and the Bible tells us he's wrapped there in these swaddling clothes and they come and they witness this site they have the announcement of these angels in their hearts and it says the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them this glorifying it could have been translated celebrating they left after seeing God's wrapped gift they left celebrating for what they had seen and what they had heard the announcement of Joy to the World and these Good Tidings and all these things it's it's real to them it's present to them and as they left this manger scene they were celebrated and praising God for what they had experienced and if I could say this way it was the presence of the promise being manifested that was bringing the joy not the joy of something to be not the joy of something past manifest bringing them joy we could we could be excited because God promises us something and therefore we could be excited about the promise and then we could be excited in anticipating its fulfillment but in the moment that God is fulfilling it that's a joy different from receive the promise of it right and then the anticipation of it this is the receiving of it this is the presence of it this is a a Greater Joy and so when Christ is born I want you to recognize this and this is why we're wanting to go to Matthew Chapter 2 and Christ was born it wasn't the event there may be a little bit of a word play here it wasn't the event but the Advent in other words it's not that they from that moment on oh remember this day when Christ was born and always going back to revisit what had been in something historical and some something some event in the past now that Christ had come there was going to be an unfolding of the presence of God there's going to be a manifestation and an interpretation of what it meant for a savior to be born there was going to be an interpretation of what it meant for a messiah to come into the world there was going to be an interpretation of all the promises pertaining to the son of David and so now they what you would want to do is from that moment walk in the light of the promises that unfolded itself so it wasn't the event that brought Joy but the Advent or is coming as we looked at it a couple Wednesdays ago or that maybe last Wednesday his coming and continued presence with it wouldn't have been appropriate for the the Shepherds just to always oh you remember that night oh man you remember that night wasn't that an amazing night and the angels lit the sky and the rejoicing I mean think of how the magnitude of what they experienced and they could have lived in the memory of that and the and the rehearsing of that but that was only the beginning there was still a messiah to be made manifest to Christ to be made known so in Matthew Chapter 2 what we do seeing is a continuation of this gift continuation of this Advent this coming not just the event of his birth but now as it begins to manifest in the promises because we could continue to read in Matthew Chapter 2 and find that the the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream and tells him to flee down into Egypt and then come back out of Egypt that it might be fulfilled as it was spoken by Hosea the prophet out of Egypt have I called my son so there's more fulfillments of fulfillments of Prophecy that are manifesting in the Life of Christ as he grows increases wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man so in verses 9 to 11 he says when they'd heard the king they departed now this is the the wise men the magias as they're said and we the Bible only tells us that there were wise men we get the three from the three gifts and uh and there's a there's a lot I remember as a children uh we'd have a nativity scene set up on Christmas and nativity scene had wise men at the where the babe was in the manger and so being a legalist when it comes to the scripture I would take the wise men and put him in the front yard he said they're not quite there yet they're on their way they'll get there but they weren't there at his birth and so we know that he was a young child and it was they weren't there at the night of his birth and so it says that they'd come from the East and now it says in verse 9 and when they'd heard they come and they see The King The King says oh oh please tell me where this Messiah is born so I can worship him right and wink wink to his army General right if we could just figure out where he is we'll take care of this and there's a reason why he requested the the um the uh the genocide of male babies two and under because they would have been in that time frame so Christ when they saw the star when it appeared and how long they'd been journeying would have placed child Christ as a young child nearly two years old and so now it says that when they Departed the king and when they'd enter Jerusalem brother Brandon even touches it on this way and a lot of uh the way the scripture is written and brother random emphasizes this that when they had entered into Jerusalem the star that they were following disappeared so now that they're there they're like well we were falling a star we came to Jerusalem maybe they thought this is where it would be but now that they've entered into that religion and into that air that churchianity and all those things the Stars no longer appeared but now when they leave they as they begin to Journey again they say that they see the star and it went before them so now it's leading again until it come and stood over where the young child was and it says and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and then they they gave the gifts and they worshiped him and they knelt down before him and worshiped him now what I want to emphasize here is that they're rejoicing wasn't just in the star alone it wasn't oh there's the star again we're excited about the star if the star itself was the cause for rejoicing they never would have had the left the leave the East it should have never left they could have just worshiped the star they could have been excited about the story they could have talked about the star they could have written about the star but when they saw the star they knew the star meant something greater than the appearance of the star and they were moved to follow the star because the star was a Guiding Light to bring them to the promise the star was not the promise himself so the cause of Joy or the true cause of rejoicing as it says when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy the verse before it tells us that the star LED them to where the young child was and that's the true cause of rejoicing it wasn't the star in the sky but it was the star in the house because the Bible tells us that Jesus I Jesus had sent me an angel to testify to you these things in the church is I am the root in The Offspring of David the bright in Morningstar Revelations 22 16. so this Guiding Light this star that was in the sky was leading him to Christ even John Wesley when he comments on this verse he writes when they saw the star standing over the child they rejoiced with exceeding great joy that's what that's what the cause of rejoicing is when it led them to the place that they'd been seeking when it brought them to the finish line of what it had been promising and so once the star had led him to Christ this was the time to Rejoice fully this was a time uh that they could really let out a praise see and the star is great it's wonderful because you know it's guiding you that gives you a sense of anticipation that gives just as the angel said unto uh to Zacharias you're going to have joy and gladness and then you'll Rejoice at his birth that gives you reason to be excited right just knowing that Joy is coming it gives you a reason to be joyful in itself but now when they find the child that is a true cause of rejoicing and they Rejoice with exceeding great joy the star appearing was only a temporary event that was to lead him to Christ and if I could say this the joy for the wise men began in knowing what the star meant hey that it was going to lead them to a messiah and that's what that's that's really if they had just rejoiced in the star uh from a scientific standpoint that wouldn't have been a reason to that's the wrong reason to be happy and maybe a lot of astrologers and stargazers or whatever could have been astronomers I could have been looking at him like wow this is amazing we never said anything like this this is fantastic I'm really excited and to be like well that's not really you're looking at it wrong it's not the constellation it's not the brightness of it it's not that we've never seen this before it's the fact that this is a Guiding Light declaring that God has sent a gift to the Earth that the Messiah has been sent that God is wrapping himself in flesh that's the real cause for Joy so if you see the sign or you see the star true Joy only begins when you recognize what it really means and so the fullness of rejoicing was not in recognizing the star even following the star but it was in knowing what it was leading them to and the complete joy as it said they rejoiced with exceeding great joy this complete Joy was in seeing the manifestation of the promise having that Star Guide him to that spot finding out what the star getting to the place that the star appointed them to as they had come and they said where is this king of the Jews they knew the Stars signified this royalty the coming of the Messiah where is he that's the reason why they were drawn from the East to Jerusalem and to Israel now in John chapter 3 verses 26 to 30. it's wonderful we have just a really nice group here tonight because these are some things that maybe we might follow up on and you'll have a really a sound basis to have already kind of digested these things pondered them a little bit uh studied it in them yourselves and then if we come back together we preach this and there's some more people here you all will be amen and they're like wait what did I miss right it'd be nice that'd be fun and John chapter 3 verses 26 to 30. I want you to recognize this in terms of this complete joy as they read the the Magis Rejoice with exceeding great joy when the star LED them to where the child was now here's the Forerunner John it says and they came Disciples of John came unto John and said to him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond Jordan to whom thou bearest witness what was it Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the world behold the same which is Christ baptize it and all men come to him now they were a little upset that the very one that John said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world this is the one I told you about and now people begin to follow them there's still some Disciples of John they were having trouble with the transition and didn't like the fact that people were following Christ they were still Disciples of John and hadn't caught the transition so John ansonus said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from Heaven what a beautiful response just in terms of a general idea he says ye bear witness ye yourselves bear witness bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but that I am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom what a tremendous statement but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice now notice the language and the analogy he's trying to use to his disciples who are a little bit miffed that Jesus now has followers and he's baptizing also and he's in the Fulfillment of John's prophecy he's the Vindication of John's Ministry and so John uses this language he says I am not the Christ I'm the Forerunner it's important for us to recognize that I am not the Christ but I am the forerun I'm the one that was sent before him and he that hath the bride is the bridegroom I am a friend of the bridegroom I am near him and I hear his voice and I Rejoice greatly because the bridegroom's voice and notice this phrase this my joy therefore is fulfilled thus my joy as a prophet as the Forerunner is complete because I see the bridegroom with his bride in the voice of the bridegroom is my rejoicing because I can say I've done what I was supposed to do if this is the authentication of my Ministry this is the Vindication that I was a forerunner in the fact that the one that I claim to forerun is here manifesting himself he says my joy is full my joy is complete because I see Christ with his people Christ with his followers so he makes this statement he must increase but I must decrease remember my title tonight is rejoice in the gift rejoice in the gift and that there's a rejoicing that we must have there's a fellowship that we must have a rejoice in that we must have and that there's a completion of it when we come there's this exceeding great joy that we can achieve when we recognize the Fulfillment of the word of God in our hour in the sermon voice of the sign ow now let me just I'll say this that there's a in sports there's a phenomena of a letdown game because maybe there's a big game coming up and so the teams play on the weekend and they lose to a team that they otherwise ought to have been because they were looking forward to the next weekend and so there's a little bit of a letdown let's not do that tonight okay let's not look forward to the weekend let's get everything we can right now let's not lose something tonight so everybody who's here and present helped me to preach this because I'm not going to stop until I'm satisfied how's that I'm not going to quit until I'm done until I Feel Complete there's been many times I've left the pulpit and I've just salt because I felt incomplete I felt like I laid an egg I did a horrible job well tonight if I feel bad I'm just going to keep preaching until I feel good and that's gonna be up to you to make me feel good all right so some incentive there it's not reverse psychology it's just nothing but the truth I need your help tonight now John said thus my joy this my joy is complete is fulfilled because the bridegroom whom I full ran I hear his voice now he's the one speaking and he's with his bride and I'm the one that's near the bridegroom and I'm satisfied I'm happy to see those attracted to Christ come to Christ and know Christ and he says I must in he must increase so I must decrease now there's certainly a way that that could have been that could be misused to bring dishonor to the prophet Jesus is sure to say that there's no none greater than John and so brother Brandon picks up on this and voice of the sign he said John The Prophet's appearing on Earth after 400 years without a prophet the sign after 400 years of him appearing that little lacks time little slacking off a little quiet time says now if you're spiritual you'll catch what I'm saying right what's his testimony as John 4 ran just as John a very critical phrase associated with brother Brown's Ministry he says now if you're spiritual you'll catch what I'm saying may God open up your understanding how long has it been 400 years that Israel without a prophet the churches had got all twisted up and they're here come John on the scene John was the prophet a sign that the Messiah was going to speak after him watch because Malachi 3 said I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way prepare the people look at John no selfishness in him he never took any Glory they tried to call him the Messiah now if you're a spiritual catch what he's trying to say right to try to call him the side he says I'm not worthy to lose the shoes but as soon as Jesus appeared he had a sign a pillar fire A Light Above him like a dove come down from a voice saying this is my beloved Son whom I'm well pleased notice and John immediately said he must increase I must decrease and if you're taking notes I'd write this one down he presented the church to Christ now notice the unique way that brother Banner phrased that John had developed disciples and followers and we know that many of Jesus's disciples were previously followers of John and even them would have been in this transition phase of walking with John and seeing Christ and then we see that Peter and some of them begin to follow Christ holy and only and now he says I must decrease because Christ must increase and what John did is he presented he handed the church off to Christ sometimes we say well it's the introduction of Christ to the church but there's also this element of John presenting the church to Christ and then Christ is the one that introduces the faith to the Christian church that's what brother Adam taught us that Christ is the one there's an introduction made but it's not the messenger it's not John that brings the faith and introduces the faith to the Pentecostal fathers but it's Christ to introduce the faith to the Christian church and he says we are told that in the last days that will repeat again there's going to be a message come forth that will introduce the Messiah to the people and it will be in such a way they'll stand stand dumbfounded like they did then he promised it right right can it happen in a way they're going to stand dumbfound now it doesn't mean it's going to happen exactly the same way but there'll be some of the same elements some of the same Intrigue some of the same mystery he says there's a promise that it's going to happen it will repeat again there's going to be a message that will introduce the Messiah but it's going to happen in a way where people will be dumbfounded it's not going to be obvious they're going to be confused there's going to be a lot of people tripping up but he says he promised it and the sermon proven his word brother Brahm says we know that there's a messiah coming and when that Messiah comes he's going to be the word how will he appear in the last days so that the bride will know her mate the revealed word these are the things that we're taught about the message of the hour and so if I could say this when I say rejoice in the gift his presence is the real gift today he's thinking of that statement over and over again I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst are we impressed sufficiently impressed with this presence in the sermon we have seen his star and have come to worship Him I found this Sermon Just to be uh it's such a brother-in spirit in the sermon it's just so beautiful how he preached such a masterpiece at this uh in this banquet I believe it was and just how he pulled the people and was just making this beautiful introduction in such a way to where one would just want to fall in love with Christ he says but tonight we know that you're here somehow maybe we might not see it seen it with just our eyes but we felt it with our other sense our sense of feeling the sense of feeling our heart our conscience our soul spoke to us and said this is what I'd want our hearts to ring out in this Christian time Christmas time we're in the presence of Jesus Christ the greatest Christmas gift the first real Christmas gift from God to man can our souls uh feel that and experience that that the real gift is Christ he says that the we're in the presence of Jesus Christ and the presence of Jesus Christ is the great greatest Christmas gift the presence of Jesus Christ was the first real Christmas gift that God gave man and he says can I well I'm saying it to you this way can our souls say we're in the presence of Jesus Christ as Paul says in first Thessalonians 2 19 what is Our Hope what is our joy what is our crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ it is coming is not his presence our crown of rejoicing is it not our Vindication as the Bible says that that constant wearing of the unjust judge and finally says I'll just get rid of the woman I will avenge her and God Jesus says he will avenge his only elect speedily he'll come to their aid come to their defense and he says but will the son of man find faith when he cometh that's the revealing of the son of man looking for that Faith that's excited in the people that that desire from the people and that's our Vindication that's our Triumph are we not in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ when he makes himself known unto us in the sermon why it had to be Shepherd how many of you young people have been doing Phil and the blank are any of you familiar with that it's not fill in the blanks but it's Phil p-h-i-l and the blanks and he does it to it with our young people gives them those handouts to fill in the blanks and there's one of them is why it had to be Shepherd not Shepherds singular why it had to be Shepherd and he says Christ is the word the anointed word made manifest and if there's any Open Hearts here tonight that don't have that Messiah the real Christmas gift the only real Christmas gift there is that God gave the world and declared declared it to the World by Shepherds of this of Islam the atonement for sin and if that heart is open and I I love this place it in place in it Lord the Messiah word of today what a beautiful prayer these prayers he's praying in these sermons he says oh if they don't have the real Messiah the real Christmas gift and he says place the Messiah word of today in their hearts he says we commit them to you in the name of Jesus Christ your son and as he comes into that sermon he says I'm so happy to know that I live in the presence of the king the Messiah word of today not some denominational expectation not some promise to another day but the Messiah word of today says I'm happy to know I'm living in the presence of the king he says Lord could you place the Messiah word of today in the hearts of the people we've been using Deuteronomy 16 15. that time of rejoicing the season of our joy for Israel it says for seven days you are to celebrate in the presence of the Lord your God where is it when the time of the Harvest will your joy be complete that's the time we're living in now the Rapture time the Harvest Time the harvest season therefore it's a time to celebrate not so because of some future event but in the Harvest presently where there's the ripening taking place we are laying in the presence of the son to ripen that means there has to be a present s-o-n causing you to ripen we're not ripening in the promise of the sun we're ripening in the presence of the Sun there's this uh I I had all these in my my notes to share with you tonight and I well just kept trimming it down and trimming it down and I have more than I would normally take to any service I've I've had less notes for a convention and I hope there's one thing you notice I take a Wednesday night just as seriously as I would a Saturday Saturday night in the Congo preaching at 35 000 people just as serious I might be eating better and getting more sleep for a Wednesday night than that but still take it very serious now there's a Peter talks about how they'll be scoffing as conference at the list they said where is the promise of his coming where is the message of his coming where where is it because everything remains as it was and nothing has ever changed what is it they miss they miss the coming they miss the truth of it they're looking for something else and when we talk about the promise of something there's a way that we can say oh well the promise of his coming is the fact that God promised that he would come but what is the promise of spring life green rain uh vitality and so when you receive the promise the promise of it is all these things coming together the promise of something is what it brings and so when we say that we're going to be when you live in this time we're to celebrate in the presence of the Lord Our God because it's harvest time this is the time of perfection this is a time of ripening this is the time of the the soon it's going to happen where we will be out of here and it's in that time he says your joy will be complete and brother brannerman the Harvest Time says the church that lives by that word rightly not through organization but in the presence of the word the son it becomes a very same word that went down on the day of Pentecost that is a mouthful I think our students should diagram this in their homeschool classes the church that lives by the word he says rightly not through organization but in the presence of the word the son could you imagine this diagram do we diagram sentences anymore it says it becomes a real it becomes a a very same word that went down on the day of Pentecost would you catch that not the same word that was there in the upper room that received what came down but they become the word that comes down they become the same word that the church that lives by the word correctly in the presence of the son the word becomes the very same word he says doesn't Malachi 4 teach us that before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come that this will take place how many knows that and he will restore the hearts of the children of the fathers is that right the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers and in that day Luke 17 30 I believe it is when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man not a son of man but the son of man a son of man revealing the son of man he says the word I love this the word living itself again among the people now it's got to become a personal identification the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of the this hour the message if I can say this way you are a reflection of the message of the hour a reflection of it you live again the life that was in Jesus Christ you are in the presence of the son you'll become the visible manifestation of the invisible God you become the visible manifestation of God who is the invisible God made flesh in Christ you become the same thing this is part of the revelation of the rapture remember when brother Madam takes his text I think I maybe have it here okay I do I'll come to it here in a moment this is part of the revelation of the Rapture in the secret of his Tabernacle what is in the secret of his presence he'll hide me you are in the presence of the son he says this revelation of the son of man is you becoming a reflection of the word of God the Bible says in first chronicles 16 27 Glory and Honor are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place the Bible says that do you celebrate the presence of the Lord your God at the place where the Lord will choose because he's going to bless you with the Harvest and your joy will be complete Glory and Honor in his presence you want Glory and Honor you want rejoice and you want praise be in his presence and strength and gladness are in the same place where he is it says in Exodus chapter 15 at that time of The Exodus and crossing the Red Sea the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation notice the phrasing he has become my salvation not the event of being saved but the person the savior he is my salvation the Lord is my strength and my song he has become my salvation he is my God and I will prepare him at habitation Exodus 15 2. I will prepare him in habitation my father's God and I will exalt him notice what it's saying that he is the Lord is my strength he's my song He's my praise he's my rejoicing and he has become my salvation so I will prepare him a habitation and what does the psalmist tell us that the Lord oh Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit us the Praises of Israel what does this tell us that I'm going to how can we build a habitation for God how could you build up a house how is it you could set him up a structure in a place that he could reside I will prepare him at habitation our joy is when we make our heart his home that that we rejoice in him he has become our salvation and then our joyful hearts become the habitation prepared for him there's been a statement I've been longing to read to you uh since the beginning of this series and I'll say this for everyone I don't even want those streaming at home jot this down go look it up the full paragraph the things he's saying preceding this because he's talking about attending Wednesday night services but uh you know I want you all to read this and see this but I'm clipping it for briefing us here brother bam says in the sermon why there's he's talking about why is there no joy in the house of the Lord anymore he says we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure we're finding our satisfaction and other things instead of the house of God and I believe that we ought to make a much more I apologize for saying it to the Wednesday night crowd on the Wednesday before uh Christmas to the group that's been here 52 Wednesday nights already or however many there are but I think we ought to get even more perseverant and labor and press to be in the house of God together is notice what he says we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people The Joy write that down take pictures of it the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people what makes God happy to see you happy the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people what a Dynamo what what omnipotence meeting the joy the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord this place it may not seem like much this Gathering May pale in comparison to others but this is the joy of the Lord and the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God he wants you to do that so God bless you here towards the end of this year those who've persevered who are making these Services God bless you your joy is the Lord's Joy this is a joy to us to be here I don't often do this but I'll say God bless brother Eli and sister Kendall who drive from Tucson on Wednesday nights round trip and would they do this if this was a chore no but there's a joy in it and I I think of just how how the kind of character their children are going to have when their parents willing to make sacrifices like that and through traffic and through hours and working long days why this is the joy of the Lord the house of Lord is a joiner and think about happy and makes God because the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people and he wants to see us making this effort he wants us to see us rejoice in the right things I hope no one feels cited that I would call a name any particular family maybe I'll try to name you all before next year's over in Psalms 27 verses 1 to 6. how many know where the sermon that brother Branham took Psalms 27 1-5 in the rapture and he said many people many preachers would go down the main Avenues go down certain Avenues and take the real obvious scriptures and brother bam kind of gets to the more obvious ones later but as a prophet he said he's directed to a prophecy of the Rapture in Psalms 27 and he takes an unorthodox text but when you begin to read it it's everything Christ is in this Rapture cycle in the first characteristic of Christ psalms 27 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation this is what he becomes he's the light he's that word that comes to us say open the shield seals that's why Brethren says there's a man here can turn on the light Shalom it is the rising of the Sun the Lord is my light and my salvation again in this Rapture Exodus time in the Third Exodus I will rejoice in the Lord he is my strength and my song and is become my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to what eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell is it not describing death itself though the whole shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after and this is what he wanted that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life but he didn't just want to be in the house empty all by himself to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple he wanted to be in his presence and so for in the time of trouble which is the characteristic of this time this day we're living from the time of time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me in Psalms 31 20 The Pavilion is the secret and the secret of thy presence from The Strife of tongues from the pride of men that is what David is seeking I want to be in his presence in a time of trouble if I could just be hid in his presence that's where my safety is for man shall be a hiding place the Bible tells us he will hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall set me up upon a rock the Rapture is a revelation and now he says in verse 6 and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord God why because this his presence in this time of trouble is what lifts your head up above your enemies you're in the presence of your enemies but you're feasting in the presence of your enemies a table he's prepared for you in the presence of your enemies in Psalms 118 14 and 15 the Lord is my strength and song and has become my salvation kind of mirroring there in Exodus 15 the voice of rejoice and in Salvation is in the Tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly was this is the strength and salvation of Psalms 27 and because he is your hiding place the Lord is my light and salvation he's the strength of my life therefore there's the voice of rejoicing therefore their sacrifices of Joy therefore I sing I will sing praises unto the Lord I believe his presence is with us something that would promise for thousands of years coming to pass then brother Brown and the sermon the presence of God unrecognized there's a theme that you could look into more deeply he said if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings I love this phrase is everybody with us you follow me guys I said he says this he says he is appearing to us in these meetings this is June 18 1964 all that summer of 64. he says for one purpose that is to release our desires that we have in him to us to release the desires that we have in him to us a deep calling to The Deep a thirst a hunger maybe even ones you don't even know about brother man talked about in Christ the mystery why do you hunger why do you thirst there may be things that we're craving there may be some sense of dissatisfaction may seem some sort of incompleteness and there's always this longing and that doesn't satisfy this doesn't satisfy and I never get any traction with this and why is it then that we sense his presence why is it that we see the Fingerprints of God in our lives and we know he's with us and he's performing Miracles but yet something just isn't quite clicking because what he wants to do is to release the desires that we have in him that are hidden in him our real desire our real hungry and our real Joy he wants to release it to us praise the Lord but we've got to recognize his presence he says but we've got to recognize his presence and now how to recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest not the promised word of Moses age or any other ages the promised word of this the promise of the word for this age this is the gift this is what we're rejoicing in it's his presence he says he wants to release the desires that we have in him to us do you notice the way he says it I realize that even the way he says it's kind of like it's almost uh not cryptic but like there's just something there he says in such a unique way but it's as if there's Desires in him that he wants to release to us but if we never get past the veneer we never get past the surface we only get caught up in the the Dynamics of a wonderful worship service or or all these other things if we don't recognize his presence and not just the moving of God but the word promise for today then the desires that we that are in him that we could receive aren't going to be released to us so if he could recognize his presence that's when our joy is satisfied that's when the pleasures are released to us that's when we can celebrate we recognize his presence and I believe that in this hour there's a prophetic dispensation that we're living in wherein Christ has become our salvation we're going to preach on the subject of rewards he appeared to Abraham and said I am exceeding great reward my interest isn't in the the rewards that he can give me as even we say well I don't want the healing I want the Healer I there's things wow you could just start thinking along those lines of all these things just the gifts the gifts the gifts and we say we want the Gift Giver and there's things that the baptism the Holy Ghost does that we must have but it makes way for the Holy Ghost itself and there's the gifts of the Holy Ghost and there's gifts that he sends and gifts that he brings even prophetic gifts and Ministries and Messengers and angels and stars but they point to ultimately it's that cycle the major and a minor and a minor will always lead you back to the major which is Christ we've got to be recognizing Christ in his season and all arriving back to him and say this is the gift itself not just gifts that his presence will bring but his presence itself this is what the Bride Can rejoice in I can say because her promise in the end time it's here we're in that season of salvation it says in Psalm 16 11 that will show me the path of Life think about the language that's being used show me the path of life and in thy presence is the fullness of joy in thy presence is the fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forevermore brother Bram says he's wanting to release our desires that we have in him to us where are we going to get him at his right hand because that's where the pleasures are that's where the desires are as I said that the right hand of the Lord doeth valently at his right hand or Pleasures forevermore brother Brahman in the sermon then Jesus came and called he says what is the right hand not a hand like man or mine it's the power the right hand of power he is God With Us God in us God here now the right hand ever living present right here when you need God you don't have to go to heaven he's right here with you when you need God you don't even have to go to church you don't have to go to a convention he says he's right here with you he's God in us right hand ever living present right here this is the full reality that we want to walk in this present tense Christ not watered down not filtered not withheld not restrained but to believe every promise of God in the scriptures for us he's right here with you and the sermon excuse me in Matthew chapter 9 we're just closing this is my last scripture I have a couple of quotations to read to you but they came to John in John chapter 3 questioning him it's funny just how difficult John's disciples were having the difficulty are having in recognizing Christ but in Matthew chapter 9 verses 14 and 50 says then came to him the Disciples of John saying why do we in the Pharisees fast oft but the disciples fast not why is it we've got more signs and wonders why is it we do more miracles why is it that we're more religious why is it that we're more strict and the disciples don't and or he says and he says and Jesus said unto them because they're I I find it interesting I do want to expound upon this later but the Disciples of John are questioning the Vindication of John's Ministry says and Jesus said unto them can the children of the Bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them if we have if we're in the presence of the king if we are in the presence of the word that was promised in this time not not we've got to recognize the promise for today if there's another promise if there's another appearance if there's another coming if there's another happening let me put it this way if there's a meeting in the air you're going to be there but you want to be walking in the shout you want to be walking in the voice in order to be of the Trump that brings you to the meeting the air he says how can we mourn how can the children of the Bride chamber mourn when the bridegroom is with them again another use of the knowledge of the marriage how can we as his bride mourn when we are in the presence of our bridegroom this is not our season of mourning this is not our season of weeping oh I know there's a way that we want to kind of uh beat ourselves up and Woe Is man this is so weary and this is so hard and trust me we feel it and it is but oh if we could get our eyes on Christ and realize that in the midst of all the darkness he's still making himself known do we not can we not testify as a church just look back of the last 11 months can we not testify to the goodness of God being cancer-free right my my aunt who is in stage four uterine cancer sent a testimony cancer free God's moving in many many ways declaring himself the same God that he's always been and and he wants to release he wants our faith to rise to receive him and for who he is in this hour why should we mourn why should we start we should we be sorrowful and the sermon why it had to be Shepherd I I was wishing earlier this week that I had the time to write all right out just the testimonies that we could express of the prayers that have been answered in this church alone God is working miracles [Music] he's present with us and why it had to be Shepherd again this these prayers he prays at the end of these Christmas sermons are so phenomenal receive this Lord we receive your Christmas gift the Messiah the anointed word that vindicates your presence with this Lord regardless of Creator denomination that's it if anybody asks you who Jesus Christ is he's the Living Word that makes God present that's who he is we received the Messiah the anointed word that vindicates your present with presence with this Lord we find ourselves today the world Fallen apart and here the great Messiah stands with his hands outstretched Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that made the promise that in this last days the church would be so organized to go into laodicea and we see it today Lord what can we do dear God what can I do this is this this quote here is just it's my Christmas quote this year he says help me and these other Shepherds Lord around the world Shepherds of the word to Proclaim it Lord in this next year let's pray that for me let's pray that for us this church here sends out a number of ministers from here there's four other ministers that are sent out preaching all over in Mexico and all over North America and even going overseas may that be the prayer for the ministry here may that be our prayer for Ministries everywhere forgot to question brother Andrew brother Elias palangio they're the pastor in Arusha Tanzania very very sick does a tremendous work in labor and getting the message out on those regions and I pray God would heal him just so miraculously that he'd see it's the hand of God touched him but my prayer for him and and for all the Shepherds and for us as a church to Proclaim it to proclaim the present Messiah who stands with hands outstretch Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he says wait let us Proclaim it help us Lord we pray give us thy love oh we've got to have that first and thy spirit and thy light we dedicate ourselves tonight to Thy word and to thy call tonight and let it be that our prayer as this is my last sermon with you together this year let us dedicate ourselves tonight to Thy word and to his call he says in Jesus Christ's name we receive your Christmas gift can we read it with me the word of God made flesh in US amen what a gift give us your love Lord give us your spirit give us your light and let's dedicate ourselves to his word into his call and receive his Christmas gift the word made flesh in US because you're the reflection of the message of the hour foreign if you've got good eyesight this is it and if I don't feel good at the end of this I've got all this and there's places I've studied in this Bible that I'm convinced I could preach series on if I found myself somewhere and didn't have anything to go by just pick up this Bible and start with the book of Galatians I hope the kids brought pajamas if I don't feel good in a few minutes but the Providence of God to pick a quote like this up to end on I want you to focus with me now and think here how if you have to just concentrate don't go to sleep but concentrate by focusing your attention on it do I have the quote there from uh Shalom brother John did I put that in there the last one no okay good so you can just listen for it listen to what he says but brother bear says he says we are creatures of time he's the god of Eternity now you couldn't you couldn't come up with a greater contrast we're creatures of time he's the god of Eternity and listen to The Grace he's expressing to us this is the message Shalom right if it's within that theme but there's a man here can turn on the light and and those and those different themes he's preaching there right at the end of 63 the beginning of 64. and uh and this so we want to really focus in on what those themes would be we're creatures of time he's the god of Eternity and then he says this we try to press ourselves we try to make something different oh this has got to be done do we feel like that sometimes we're trying to press ourselves and I would say almost whatever it is getting certain things done and getting the gifts wrapped in time or buying this or doing that and making things look a certain way whatever it might be that we're trying to pressure that we got to get this done he says remember he knows all about it and I believe it's in our hearts maybe sometimes he's saying we're creatures of time he's the god of Eternity he's bringing that contrast we're Bound by time and distance and language but he's a god of Eternity and we think things just have to happen a certain way and we're trying to make something different or it has to be done a certain way he's telling us just relax he knows all about it it's going to happen anyhow let him do it just commit yourself to him and in any of these things that are preached it's not it's not something we got to work ourselves into it be something different he knows all about it it's going to happen let them do it just commit yourself to him and he says look up and shine with joy of the Lord to know that you've been privileged your eyes have come open and to see this day and that's what we ought to do he's a present tense God and we get all worried oh I'm just not sure what it's going to be like in the Millennium that's going to happen hey let's not lose our joy now about what is it going to be like in the Millennium no I there's let's look at the promise today and he says that we we look up and shine with the joy of the Lord to know what we've seen what our eyes have been opened up to today and then he says trust him for the future that's what we ought to do is just trust him for the future just radiate in the presence of the sun just Sparkle back with joy just as that Dew Drop in the morning begins to shake a little bit just like that bubbling brook that seems so happy why are you so happy because something is driving me something is propelling me to be happy that Dew Drop is happy because there's a sunlight that is beaming upon it and then he says trust him for the future you've seen him vindicate his word in days past he that Vindicated his word in days past and made all these things other things happened just exactly to the hour that we're living in everything exactly to the seventh Angel's message both showed it in heaven on Earth and made it known their three ways so there can't be no slip up remember he promised he'd come again Hallelujah that word will be a Vindicated God's promised word with 2 000 years of waiting he will arrive on time don't try to press yourself and make yourself something different just commit yourself to him and shine with the joy of the Lord rejoicing in what he's allowed your eyes to see and he says don't be weary he'll be here as he has Vindicated his word in every age the church ages show the same thing and the revealing of Our Lord by the seventh message and so forth God revealed it manifested it and proved it and in among us today he showed himself here with us improved and Vindicated his word so will he what will he do prove his word vindicate his word so what we need to do is just commit ourselves to him trust him for the future and shine with the joy of our salvation stand with me tonight
