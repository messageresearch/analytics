TRANSCRIPT
========================================
one verse there this morning and then we'll jump right into some other spots here it says and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness my what a beautiful beautiful description for the time that we're living in in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness let's go to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we're so grateful to be gathered together today as believers as the bride of jesus christ lord as those who are longing to fellowship with you and those who desire to have your word take preeminence in our lives so lord we pray today that you would just bless us with your presence and we acknowledge it already lord we sense your presence and we we're grateful for it now lord we pray that the word would be rightly divided to our hearts that we could feed on it sustain us and strengthen us and i commit the people to you today that are here the many who would desire to be here unable to make it lord there's different ones that have reached out and expressed they can't be here today but they wanted to be i pray that you be with them in them their circumstance lord we pray for those who would be streaming that there would be a connection with the body of christ that there would be a sense of participation in the service as they pull upon the word of god and may you speak to them and lord i just pray that you come now in a special way and speak to our hearts we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated it's good to see the strayers come down the hill i guess they say to be with us today god bless you it's nice to see you in the house of the lord wonderful wonderful for the uh the younger generation uh to see the encouragement of those who've gone before us and get behind the word of god i find there's such a tremendous hunger in the bride of jesus christ and it knows no boundary of age or geography and sometimes it comes from the most surprising places when you begin to fellowship you're like wow they're really feeding on the heart of this message they are hungry and it's just wonderful to see how the message continues to grow and become more real to even those that we've looked up to and admired for years who've walked in this message for decades and it's not just the same message that they were feeding on you know 30 40 years ago it's gone great it's gotten greater it's gotten brighter and it's gotten more intense and i think that's just an inspiration and encouragement to us all so god bless you thank you for coming today and visiting us we've been looking at genesis chapter one i'm just going to jump right back into it again genesis chapter 1 as we're looking at the subject of in the beginning and it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth i'm still pondering this now after a few months just how impactful this scripture is and just how full of truth and depth to it and what i've been looking at to maybe the words i want to put it in this morning as we've looked at what heaven and earth means and we've looked at different angles from this first chapter but i want to look at it this way that from the moment that god begins to create and he himself comes into existence as a being that is worship god is unfolding a mystery god at one time would have just been by himself that he would not have been known because there was no one to know him but as he creates he begins to unfold his nature and his desire and it becomes an expression of himself creation becomes an expression of the creator and the creation is expressing god's ambition and we have the benefit today of with by the word of god of knowing what was in his heart and what his ambition was that he created the earth for a purpose and that was to get a bride out of him so he was very focused and he had a singular goal in the beginning but yet this so it's expressing his ambition now as we say that he is a mystery is unfolding he's actually it's hidden because it's called a mystery if it was obvious maybe it wouldn't be used i wouldn't use that language that it's a mystery but he's hiding a mystery in the creation his ambition is in the creation each uh turn that he makes and each thing that he speaks and each image that unfolds is expressing something and holds significance and so he's hiding a mystery and we know that god where god hides himself he also reveals himself so he hides himself in simplicity he reveals himself in simplicity so where god was hiding himself in the beginning he's also revealing a mystery in the simplicity of creation and so it's as if that from this moment we say in the beginning god we can say the mystery of god begins because to this point we don't know god to this point he's not a being that is known he's not a being that is worshipped but now he begins to make himself known and declare himself and the mystery of god begins and in the sermon christ is the mystery of god revealed he says when you read in the beginning god created he said there is christ now we probably read this often and we read it say brother branham said you should see christ in every verse of the bible if you don't see it go back and read it again and it's almost as if this just becomes uh an exercise where we just try to see christ but i believe that in this what he's saying here in the beginning god created he's wanted us to understand there's christ in the beginning and christ is the mystery of god revealed so in the beginning god created there's god is being un made known and god has unveiled himself in the beginning this is the mystery of god being un unveiled in acts chapter 15 verse 18 it says known unto god or all his works from the beginning god knows the beginning from the end god has a plan and this verse actually is speaking about god being very purposeful and having intent in creation and that known from the beginning is god's works from the beginning of the world god knows what he's doing from the moment that he begins to create god has a goal in mind he has an end in mind he has a place that he's going to arrive and it's it really it suggests exactly what we read on the face of it this is only known to god god does not begin to act and we're all like oh i know exactly where he's going i know what he's going to do but his purpose is hidden this secret belongs to the lord so it's only known to him from the beginning of the world only god knew what he was doing so with each step there's something that unfolds and if you could catch the revelation of it you could see the purpose of god it says in ephesians chapter 3 verse 9 and to make all men see so this is paul's prayer to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery so there's a there's a mystery then a fellowship of the mystery the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ so in the beginning god created brother says there is christ this is a work of god that's only known to god it's a secret that pertains to god and it's the mystery of god it's something that the father only knows what he is doing and now paulus says he wants men to see what is the fellowship of this mystery that from the beginning of the world from in the beginning it has been hidden god so god was hiding a mystery within himself but with each step there's some symbol there's some sign there's some foreshadowing that's unfolding as god brings these things forth and to make it even more plain in the time that we're living in now what god had in his mind what god in his heart is being made known in its fullness so that we don't we're not we're not just kind of guessing we're just not probing we're not well it's dark here it's a little bit cloudy there but rather we're living in a time where the fullness the plainness is coming and being made known to us so that we can have a full fellowship of a revealed mystery not just well this is a mystery that's fellowship around it but actually enter into the fulfillment of it so in the beginning god created he said there is christ and in second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 he says but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so from the beginning you were chosen to salvation the the the choosing of you unto salvation doesn't doesn't happen when all of a sudden god hears that someone's expecting it's oh no sister so-and-so is expecting well i wonder if it's going to be a boy or a girl and when they have the baby showers oh that's going to be a boy and when the baby's born he's like well okay let's kind of figure out where they're headed and what kind of nature do they have and and god's just kind of waiting to choose and if you have a good attitude in sunday school god says well maybe i'll choose him or wait it's tier 12 maybe i'll choose him paul is saying that since the beginning from before the foundation of the world god has chosen you and elected you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so in the beginning when god creates and this mystery begins to unfold you're there at the heart of god already chosen so when it says known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world you were a chosen person from the beginning and god knew that all his works would bring you to an expected end all his works would have a climax and would have a conclusion wherein you were brought into fellowship you were brought into a relationship to him and that he would achieve what he set out to do when he first begin to create so there's a mystery that begins to unfold the mystery of god begins in verse 1 and it continues to unfold and it says the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep this darkness is obscurity it's confusion there's nothing distinct and as we read from our our text it would be very similar words how it says the blind eye shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness so this there's obscurity and there's darkness upon the face of the earth it was a dark dismal gloomy atmosphere as brother branham described it and we've we've looked into the meaning of that how satan's kingdom is death and darkness and it says and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters this is god brooding over the earth at taking impregnating whatever seed was there bringing life out of it god is now brooding over the earth and he brought light and in bringing light he brought life and so just a couple points of review god's quickening power transformed a chaotic world into a beautiful eden and god's quickening power separated darkness and it transformed chaos and confusion into order into beauty and to a a an eden of holiness and perfection and so this great mystery a great mystery was hidden in creation and now it starts to unfold and you could look at it even when god creates man and he says it's not good that man should be alone brother branham taught us that this is god reflecting something about himself so there's a mystery unfolding in creation we read last time and this will be maybe just our last point of review and then go further and if i say go further if you think i'm going to get real far you're probably going to think i'm repreaching what i've preached already but it's important sometimes just to just look at something over and over again from the perspective of the messenger as i thought about it this morning i'm really gonna i want to just share with you what brother branham taught uh so that we could understand these principles that are in the message of the hour that anchors us and we realize this is a part of the theme of the message this is these are the parameters with it which god is dealing with his bride and i want to stay within that foundation and so brethren says in god's power to transform in genesis chapter 1 this world was without form and it was void darkness was upon the earth nothing but complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a garden of eden so all god's spirit moving the spirit of god moves upon the face of the water and the entire picture changed darkness obscurity blackness chaos changes to a garden of eden and remember in the threefold purpose of christ that last purpose is to restore us back to a garden of eden condition so we're living in this time when god once again wants to change the entire picture and restore the bride from chaos to a garden of eden condition he said that's the transforming power of god that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of him that's the god i serve that's the god i believe in who could take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it that's what we're that's what we're tied to that's what we're anchored to now just a little bit more review so i apologize for misleading you and being dishonest i'm repenting for for lying to you i i didn't realize i had another quote here i wanted to read and and i want to just remind you of this at the end of the laodicean church age the world was once again spiritually in total chaos and darkness and we looked at that last sunday through the the phases of the moon and the total eclipse of the moon at the time that the pope was visiting jerusalem and so the world is completely blacked out in laodicea and we see this in revelations 3 20 this is prophecy now in revelations 3 20 it's saying that christ stands at the door behold i stand at the door and knock this means christ is now outside of the church he's outside of laodicea so something tremendous has transpired where christ one time who is in the midst of the church has become a fugitive brother brandon uses that word he's become a fugitive and christ who is the way the truth the life christ who is the light of the world he has been rejected and because he's been rejected there's no more light in the church if christ had been in the church maybe you could give a sliver of light if christ had been in the church maybe there's some indication somewhere but he has been rejected and brother branham ties this spiritual condition in laodicea to genesis chapter 1 verse 2 he said the difference is just like it was in the beginning in other words it's just like it was in the beginning the similarity the situation is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and god separated the light from the darkness so as a prophet he's orienting our view to these scriptures and saying if you can look at genesis chapter one verse two you can see a figure pre-figure foreshadowing or another expression of what we're facing today though that may have been in a physical sense now in a spiritual sense total darkness and chaos but then if that's tr if that's the case he's saying god separated light from darkness so once again he says and i believe that we are now living in that hour again when god is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that light might be made manifest that's what i want him to do in my own life i want him to take all the darkness press it to the other side of this flesh press it right on out put it behind me put it under my feet that the light may be made manifest and so we believe that we are living in that hour again what hour when the spirit of god truth is separating light from darkness the word is taking the flesh taking the world taking the devil taking uh sickness and disease and darkness and unbelief and he's pressing it all away and he's separating it from the light and once again the word is bringing forth the garden of eden out of chaos and i say a garden he's bringing a garden out of chaos and what eden is he taking it out of satan's eating he it's as if he set satan up and i think satan's so deceived that he probably hasn't picked up on it yet that he got into god's eden and he made and he thought he made a mess of it but god all along knew it would take satan six thousand years to make his eden so god took 6 000 years to make his let the devil come in and defile it because all along god knew from the beginning this was part of the mystery from the beginning he knew that once satan was like oh i've got it i've got my kingdom i'm the god of this evil age i've triumphed i've i've won and even in this sense and i'll belabor this point and probably wear this point out even to the point where he's like you know what after god seemingly restores back the church i killed it it's dead it's over it's black it's dark and satan's like this is my eden i have now exalted myself above the stars of god this is it isn't this wonderful it's right at that moment that god says satan you've achieved your perfect eden now i'm gonna bring a garden out of your eden now i'm gonna transform people into a beautiful garden a beautiful dwelling place of my presence right in your eden so this is going to be my uh my maybe not my thesis statement but the direction i'm wanting to go this morning and what i want to focus on is it's critically important for us as the bride to recon recognize the dispensational change that has occurred that at this moment that god begins to separate light from darkness there's a change in dispensations and you could even look at it in the sense that there's a blending now because brother branham as the elijah he's a keystone he's a keystone ministry he's a he's comes in the center of the arch and he comes in his ministry to blend two dispensations together and so it's a blending of a church age dispensation and eternity or a blending out of the church ages into a bright age and it's important for us to understand that there's been a change in dispensation there's been a transition by this ministry and also to understand and this would be part of my emphasis today to understand what full restoration is what full redemption is and and what this full uh manifestation of the word of god points to because in some ways we could actually view restoration in a light that isn't full light we can believe full manifestation in a light that's actually a glare of another age or looking back in another time but what we want to do is catch all the light that's accumulated and follow the pattern of the life toward accumulates and the entirety of the life arrives in the seed and not say there was life in this there was life in this but rather follow the life to where it is today and to understand what the full restoration is and what that full manifestation is pointing to and so as christ in revelations chapter 3 verse 20 is on the outside of the church he says behold i stand at the door and knock then in revelations chapter 4 verse 1 he says after this this is after the church ages revelations chapter 2 revelations chapter 3 after these symbols have been given to him i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven i believe that we should connect the door of revelations 3 20 to this door because it says and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking to me with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter this is john now walking in the pattern of the bride at the end time to where now that christ has been put out of the church there's actually a message that calls her out of babylon there's a message that calls her up higher says come up higher and as you are quickened up higher you can actually see things that are transformed trans uh transpiring things that are to be things that are going to be in the future but then also be able to look back and understand what those symbols meant in the church ages i'll show thee things which must be hereafter which is revelations chapter 5 the lamb taking hold of the book and loosing the seven seals thereof so the bride is now raised up i believe this is what this scripture stands for the bride is raised up and shown the capstone revelation she's raised up to see the capstone revelation and the climax of this revelation is the change of our body so at no point are we saying ah we've arrived we just kind of settle in isn't this wonderful but rather we realize that the message we have received in this hour is a message who which climax in power over death and i would say that that power is in you now so in 1962 this is december 31st 1962 in the contest he's just preached sirs is this the time or is this the end of the in sign time sir and as he's praying at the very end he says heavenly father as we stand here as many thoughts are dying out in our hearts and of the mistakes of last year and he says and as we're approaching the death of 1962 and the birth of 1963 now this is these are significant terms now and if you could just grab a hold of this language he's using the death of 1962 the birth of 1963 it's easy for us to very quickly think oh yeah it's new year's eve that's what he's talking about he's using the same language that we would use every year the death of 2020 which we were probably all praying for and the birth of 2021 somehow deceived into thinking it's going to be better i don't know but we we have that that we use that language at the time of a new year but brother madam as a prophet isn't merely commenting on the dying out of the calendar year and the birth of a calendar year but rather he's looking at something spiritual and he's looking at his significance and he's praying for the death of 1962. and if i could say this just from my own personal conviction i think 1962 is too much very alive in too many people's hearts and that there's a lot of people who love this message and fellowship in this message and believe this message but they're living in 1962 they're stuck in 1962 and they haven't fully walked in the birth of 1963 because brother branham when he uses this language the dying of the death of 1962 and the birth of 1963 he's actually pointing to as a prophet that there is a death that is in 62 there's a dying out that is transpiring where the entirety of life is coming out of laodicea darkness is fully coming upon laodicea but there's going to be a birth there's going to be a behold i do a new thing there's going to be a power come forth that's going to bring forth the full manifestation of the word of god and braverman says we've arrived at a dispensational change where there's going to be a death of the system there's going to be death of that order of worship there's going to be a death to the church age but there's going to be life coming to the bride a death of 1962 a birth of 63 so he says oh god may we be one step higher up the ladder why is he saying this because revelations chapter 3 has come to revelations 3 20. now we need to be one step higher up we need to come to revelations 4 1. so one step higher up the ladder until so wherever you're at on the ladder keep climbing he says climb one step higher one another step higher until we can see jesus and his program praise the lord what a beautiful sentiment of what the birth of 1963 is going to be the death of 1962 is a death to a church but the birth of 1963 is the rising of the sun it is the fullness of the word being unveiled it's christ coming on the scene to avenge his elect so he says just keep climbing the ladder if you take a step up higher that's a good job but if you don't see jesus in his program keep climbing and let me say that this message has delivered unto us a ladder that's got all the rungs we need that are necessary to keep climbing until we see jesus in his program because what comes to us in 1963 at the opening of the seals is jesus and his program amen so he prays a prayer with purpose may we come up one step higher up the ladder until we see jesus and we can see jesus and his program brother branham knew by vision that there was a great climax coming he had just preached sirs is this the time when he preaches that he references revelations chapter 10 verse 7 over and over and over again the whole sermon is built around revelations chapter 10. it's built around those mysterious seven thunders uttering their voices it's built around the mystery of god being finished and he's focusing on the thunders the thundering forth he's focusing on the mysteries that'll be tied up and to be revealed and brother branham even as he stands there probing he's actually able to identify even before these things come to pass he's able to identify all the things that his own ministry has been tying up all the loose ends but yet he still realizes there's a mystery of god that is still yet to be made plain and he's he knew this by vision he knew this by multiple dreams that he elicited from other sources in that sermon serves as this the time the day before he says this may we take one step higher up the ladder he knew by vision that there was a dying out and he knew by vision there was going to be a climax something great coming and the scripture that he's pointing to is revelations chapter 10 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets the mystery of god is going to be finished so as we look and i'll say this now so that i'm it's not like i'm trying to hide anything in the beginning we see a mystery uh begin to unfold this the starting in the beginning is the start of the mystery of god now we're looking at a scripture which says the mystery of god in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god is going to be finished so you have in the beginning it starts and in the ending it ends in the end it finishes so there's a finishing that we're facing now and is this as he says the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to serve as the prophets there's a lot of layers to that a tremendous depth to what this mystery of the old testament prophets was but then also it's the mystery that has been hid since the beginning of the bible the mystery from in the beginning you say well brother brown brother aaron after this mysteries unfolded we still have a millennium we still have all these things uh that's to take place but what was the singular mystery think about it if god's heart purpose was to have a bride of his choosing once we are fully translated and in our new bodies then we have entered into a perfection to which nothing else can be added to and then we are as we always will be with him and so god will have then achieved the fullness of redemption not just soul not just spirit but body of his bride united together as a body in a meeting in the air together with christ and now god is expressed fully in bridegroom and bride and the bride from all ages and then the rest is housekeeping right he's going to start do a pre-millennial cleanse we're going to come we're going to finish a millennial reign on earth uh satisfying certain prophecies but then god's like listen from now on it's the redemption of the earth from now on it's bringing back things that the earth is long for and there's things that come into place but what we're facing now is the finishing of that singular mystery of god because as we come into this understanding we know what's next right we we've been told how this unfolds that we know what's next and then brother benham says this and this is where i i derived this unction in my heart to see the dispensation that we're living and to recognize what restoration is brilliant says in the easter seal and i wanted to read so many different things this morning and uh and i actually was pondering having an afternoon service because i was like man there's just so much here i could always just tell whoever wants to come back and listen to me finish my quotes come back but he says oh christian what an opportunity we have he says we have opportunities are you listening because this is gonna i don't i know you've heard this before and you probably had this revelation long before i did because i just got it this week he says we have opportunities that saint paul never dreamed of having now chew on that for a while paul's revelation then brother brahman said was prophecy for today so when we recognize that brother branham preached the same gospel paul preached he does not say that so that we would bring the message back to another age or or take away the significance and the relevance for today or even put a period on that when he says i preached the same gospel paul preached he didn't put a period on it because brother branham is saying this even before he comes to his commission he was commissioned to open those seals he was commissioned to to to be a seventh angel he was commissioned to be a malachi 4 not just an angel to laodicea but a seventh angel of revelations 10. he was commissioned to be an elijah so he says i preached the same gospel paul preached he says that even before he's fully entering into his commission of these other ministries of a son of man revealing the son of man so when he says i preached the same gospel paul preached and the church would have the truth as paul had it it's not said to have a period because brother braham says we have opportunities that paul never dreamed of having that's a heavy statement we are then facing things that brother paul preached in seed form we have the privilege of walking in things that paul longed to walk in and because of that we cannot have what maybe i could term a church age mentality because if you have a church age mentality and and maybe i'm i'm putting a a a name on a tag on something that could mean different things but if you have a church age mentality then you have a thought process that's connected with the cycle because the church ages begin with the falling away and it becomes a cycle of falling away a messenger restoring a fallen away a messenger restoring to where the cycle of the church ages is a cycle of revival and death and that cycle repeats itself in every church age even to the last one because when brother branham looks at the laodicean church age how does he identify it as completely blacked out so he makes this statement when he's writing the church age book chapter three of the church age book that cycle of revival and death has never failed so it's always continued the cycle of revival and death in the church ages he says all you have to do is recall this last move of god in the spirit when men and women dress like christians went to church prayed all night took to the streets street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit now brother branham is identifying a genuine move of god in the laodicean church age we know that later devil inspired took a hold of that and got into it and corrupted it but there was a genuine outpouring it wasn't from day one and unrighteous partaking it wasn't from day one just devil-inspired men and a bunch of impersonators there was a genuine outpouring of the baptism of the holy ghost and it was it was something that god was including in the pattern of the restoration of the church and brother brahms identifying that this last move of god it takes place within the church age he says they went out with all these manifestations they left their old dead churches worshiped in homes or old store buildings they had reality he says but it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough money to build fine new churches they put in a choir instead of singing unto god for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over so now he's describing what happens within the laodicean church age after a divine sovereign move of god through the baptism of the holy ghost it wasn't long until these things start happening in the church he says the cry of joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone now he says the cry of joy was gone this is significant because what's happening christ is being kicked out of the church the cry of joy is going as it says in jeremiah 33 11 the voice of joy in the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of joy and the voice of gladness is connected with the voice of the bridegroom it's connected with the voice of the bride so as there is a falling away in a blackness that's descended upon leo to see it but says the cry of joy is gone the voice of god the voice of the bridegroom is no longer in the midst of her the voice of the bride is being snuffed out it's dwindling it's narrowing down there's darkness coming upon it the cry of joy is gone the freedom of the spirit is gone and he says oh they kept on with the form now think they kept on with the form of a voice of joy they kept on with the form of the freedom of the spirit they kept on with the form he says but the fire had died down in the blackness of ashes is all about is about all that is left this is brother random as he's writing the church age book this is you know it also it would have been finished after these seals are open he's accurately depicting the seventh church age as being blacked out burnt over the fire is gone it's the blackness of ashes and all that is left are the ashes says but they kept on with the form why because in the end time satan's power if it were possible could deceive the elect so it means it comes in a form so close and in second timothy chapter 3 verse 5 he says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away having a form great is the mystery of godliness the mystery of goddesses god made manifest in the flesh and so they have a form of godliness they have a form of the cry of joy they have a form of the freedom of spirit but it's all in a form because he says they deny the power of the re of godliness they denied the power thereof which brother brahm said they deny the power of revelation he quotes the scripture and he says the power of revelation so they have a form of godliness but denied the power of revelation which revelation is a transforming power so they have a form of god it's form it means the shape or the semblance the the image that we now should properly have is that of a shuck which is in the shape of the seed which is the husk which is in the semblance of the seed and by visually looking at it you may instinctively think it is the seed but you have to separate the shark to find the life so it can look like seed it could maybe bend down and bow like seed there's ways that it might seem to be seed but it's just a shuck or a husk around the seed because the life has already left the husk and what does brother branham pointedly and consistently do he identifies the laodicean church age as husk he identifies the pentecostal age and the pentecostals as husk he calls him shock and he preaches a sermon says the shock is not heir with the wheat one is to understand not so much in the sense that he's taking the pentecostals and running them down and and pushing them down but rather helping the genuine pentecostal to understand that their inheritance isn't in that but there's more it's not just the way he uses the language it's not just a rebuke to pentecost and maybe a judgment upon the pentecostals and a judgment upon laodicea but in the very judgment there's a blessing and the very judgment and say look elect those who have the pentecostal blessing those who've experienced the the experience because pentecost is an experience the baptism of the holy ghost there's more there's more to there's this experience is leading you into something greater something further so when you when it identifies it as shock you don't say well i i guess i'm shocked no you follow the entirety of the life you're not merely fellowshipping in the husk age you've entered into the grain age the week time the bride time the rapture time so it may seem like judgment but it's actually invitation because that's exactly what genesis chapter 3 verse 15 is the judgment upon the serpent was what prophecy of a redeemer and as as the serpents being condemned as the serpents being judged actually a way is being made for restoration back to the garden of eden a restoration back to the uh to the the condition of the garden of eden so any judgment that's pronounced upon laodicea any judgment that's pronounced upon pentecostals is not done to slam the door as it was but to awaken the bride to an entrance into where god is today and and not so much and again not leaving things behind in that we abandon uh the restoration of the gifts or we abandon the move of the holy spirit but we take it with us because wesley did not bring a revelation of sanctification by abandoning justification it would have never worked sanctification could only properly rest upon justification and the baptism of the holy ghost to the restoration and the gifts did not settle on its own accord but it followed justification and sanctification and they became more perfect in the baptism of the holy ghost so there was no abandoning the prior truths but it was being assumed into a more perfect part so when that which is perfect is common maybe i'm getting to preach what i left out of my notes i wanted to come to that which is perfect because we do have today by divine vindication so the parts are assumed into the whole so we cannot look down on justification we cannot disdain sanctification and we ought to never have the wrong view of the gifts and the wrong move of the holy spirit because it's part of our inheritance it's part of what god was making for us part of what god is choosing for us now in isaiah chapter 28 verses 9 to 11 so i appreciate the tremendous the tremendous pull up on the word of god that that i'm experiencing i imagine god must feel that there must be some uh some joy that he's experiencing uh god enjoys imparting life we've been referred to that the joy he enjoys when his people are hungry for the word and pulling on the word and as you're attentive and as you're listening uh that that rejoices god's heart i and and i'll say this brother branham always said that the amen was for the preacher so the amens are sick them to the preacher but god feels the spool of your heart right so if you if you tend to be one that is quiet don't ever feel like god hasn't seen you because you're not shouting if you tend to be one that just kind of sits there and earnestly pulls and maybe one that takes no notes and you're not boisterous i don't feel that you're missed god feels that god senses that and the man of god does too he's properly got himself out of the way if he's prepared himself through the weak and kept his uh spirit sanctified and his heart upon the center of the message then he feels he feels the pull of the people and so i i feel all of it right now of course i would say that after i prefaced it that way but i've since the pull of it now with the with the move of pentecost in view and this transition this move further brother branham identifies the this prophecy in isaiah chapter 28 verses 9 to 11 he places this within the context of the baptism of the holy ghost and laodicea the restoration of the gifts and notice the question is asked whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine so knowledge and understanding teaching and who will he teach knowledge in understanding doctrine this is what's brought into view now we know that there was a teaching reign that had to follow that had to come and because the teaching reign hadn't come it wasn't the final climax when god restored the gifts in laodicea because god there's still more it's not again that man got out of order and god had to go oh man i was just about to do something and you got out of pace god had it planned from the beginning just the way that it would unfold and so this is the question who am i going to teach knowledge who am i going to make to understand doctrine so knowledge and understanding this teaching this understanding this is what is in view and it says them that are weaned from the milk so as newborn babes we desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby so it's them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast so the images of one who is birthed but then goes to the process of development to where they mature from milk even to meat and god desires this for us as individuals but he also desired it for the church and paul in hebrews said i have things i want to teach to you but you become dull of hearing and you have need again to be taught what be the first principles because you don't have the maturity to receive meat because the full word meat belongs to those who are full age and so there is going to be an our time and i say there's going to be because i'm kind of looking at it in 62 as we transit transition to 63. so i'll say in present time we are in the time of full age the time of maturity where meat is given out to the church and therefore as individuals we are born babes and when you receive the baptism only goes you obey but now you feed on the word of god and you grow from babes to adults you grow into maturity so this is true to the church this is true also to the individual and he's saying who am i going to teach knowledge who am i going to make understand doctrine those that have matured to that place where it's time so he says for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little so things are building right things are things are building up he says for with stammering lips and other tongue will he speak to his people now it might seem to be backwards because he's saying who will i teach knowledge who shall i make to understand doctrine he very could have very well said because with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to people speak to the people and that signifies the birth that signifies the beginning but he's saying it's only those who have matured and grown up where there's line upon line precept upon precept they'll come to a time and a place where the full word will be revealed that's who's going to understand they that be wise daniel said seal them up until the end and the wise shall understand so the stammering lips referenced here in isaiah 28 verse 11. it references to being in infancy and the very hebrew word that is used it means not able to use speech napios it literally means no word so it's not uh it's not it's it's actually saying that they are not they have not come to the place to be able to articulate and understand and the bands of their tongue loose and to have knowledge and understand to speak plainly to speak clearly which the understanding relates to how how you speak and so he's saying they haven't they don't have a uh my goodness i i love how there's a draw to expound upon the subject that as we as we see things and as we experience things and the world becomes the child an infant's laboratory everything every day is an experiment and they're learning depth and they're learning hot and cold and they're learning what no means and and they instinctively just put everything in their mouth because that it's like that's their main feeler right they're just like i don't know about that they shake it they throw it down they're gaining this visual database and they're able to then move through the natural world and that's what happens for us as we begin to we're born again by the word of god we feed on the word of god listen to the voice of the messenger we read our bibles we're interacting with the word of god and we're we're taking it and we're understanding we're becoming more discernment i don't want to put that in my mouth that's not good i don't want to do this and then and there's a walking there's a growing there's an increasing that takes place in the word of god as we're feeding and this is the pattern that the child goes through to where at one time they're napios unable to speak but as you mature you come to a place ultimately what god wants to do is he wants his bride to speak clearly well she's the final voice of the final age and paul says that if i speak in an unknown tongue i become a barbarian so he doesn't just want his bride one blah blah blah blah blah blah he wants her to have a token language he wants her to speak a pure language he wants her to be able to articulate clearly the word of god speak with plainness because she prophesies again according to revelations 10 8 to 11. so the stammering lips another tongue brother branham says in the rapture in the days of the pentecostals the restoring back of the gifts the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues casting out devils and the gifts so the days of the pentecostals the laodicean church age is the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues and brother adam identifies uses this gift as like an identifier of the age speaking with tongues and it and it actually becomes so prominent it it starts their slide out of truth because they make it the evidence so isaiah chapter 28 and joel 2 28 isaiah 28 11 joel 2 28 i pour out my spirit upon all flesh this is restored in the laodicean church age this is restored to the church at the beginning of the age joel 2 28 isaiah 28 11. so this the the gifts the the the cast sound of devils signs and wonders miracles speaking in tongues that's been put back in the church in the laodicean church age can you can you see that i know you've already been taught these things very well i'm looking out at a seasoned uh veterans of the message now brother branham says in the church age book the pentecostal age did not restore now that's that's an interesting statement and we realize that in one sense it didn't restore because what was restored it fell away from but it's also not a restoration because it's not the full restoration that god promised because there was more if brother branham said we have opportunities that saint paul never dreamed of having then restoration means more restoration points to more so when in the pentecostal age when the gifts are restored and when the baptist holds comes back into the church it is the last order of the reformation so then there's a mystery of restoration that points to a greater glory there's a mystery of restoration not just to where god wants to have a church back where it has the signs and wonders operating but whatever power and potential is in the church is actually realized where we realize the realization where the full potential is maximized we walk in the full fellowship of it so there is a order of reformation that comes in the laodicean church age and if there's anything lost that has to be added back but whatever it rep what was ever representing the restoration speaks that there still is more there's another rung on the ladder take one step higher up the ladder until and that's what's being expressed so the message a man that can turn on the light he says yesterday luther's manna would not work for methodist methodist manna would not work for pentecost pentecostal manna will not work for today now i think in the past i know maybe some years ago i made the mistake of not being too uh diligent to express that pentecostal in no way descr is descriptive or is not just descriptive of the manner in which someone worships you say ah pentecostal the pentecostal manna won't work for today and you think oh well that's just a an exuberant song service and a church that has drums or a really good syncopation in the music or a move of the spirit where people are dancing and we immediately just go to the type of songs that are seeing and the way the people worship and whether or not there's kind of dancing and emotion well that's not that's not the pentecostal brother man's talking about pentecostalism is not the way that you express worship it's not the manner in which song services are conducted or the atmosphere that people move in after the word goes forth but pentecostalism is the failure to walk further in the revealed word pentecostalism is not walking in the light that's what pentecostalism is so you could just find somebody who's just as dry cold and formal they don't even have an organ let alone drums and they can be just as pentecostals anybody else no tongues no laying on of hands uh know believing that the gifts are not only put on put on the shelf but they were sent back to the manufacturer and they could be just as pentecostal as the church that is wanting to exercise them over and over again it has a great a choir and everything's really exuberant and moving because pentecostalism is not the songs you sing or the way you worship it's failure to walk further in the light and it's connected with worship because you're not worshiping in truth but it's not just what we visually inspect ah they're they're really worked up they're just a bunch of pentecostals you could be judging inaccurately completely judging wrong because you just don't judge you don't judge something by how uh whether it's pentecostal by how they worship but what's the teaching what's the knowledge does it vary from the word and it's very instructive to then not just assume that if it is exuberant and charismatic and it's the rain is falling that number one that's a vindication of the doctrine or number two that their doctrine is correct or that this is something that uh is is not pentecostalism that this is what pentecost represents you've got to have discernment in this hour to know the difference so he says pentecostal manna will not work for today every day it come day by day fresh and so has it through the church ages luther's manna was the message of justification wesley's manna message was the manifestation of sanctification pentecostal was the restoration of the gifts so you have to recognize that these are church ages not just these men's messages and not just in age within the age these characterize the age itself luther wesley pentecost the pentecost being this laodicean age it was the restoration of the gifts he says but that's a change right this is the introducing of the headstone the last day the brine tree he says which is contrary to all of it and yet it's the same light for the matured why is it contrary to all of it because they cabbage down they stop they put a period and even the restoration against pentecost this last great move in laodicea they stop and refuse to walk further in the light he said so it seems to stand against all of it but it's the same light for the matured he said this is the introducing of the headstone if you look at the statue of a perfect man the lord of the sea and age is that seventh age but then there comes a move of the holy ghost to what introduce the headstone and where brother branham points us is not in the beginning of laodicea not even at the end of laodicea but something that happens at the same time that laodicea is going into chaos there is an introduction of the headstone the same light for the maturity an introduction of the headstone whom shall he teach knowledge for whom shall he make to understand doctrine the introduction of the headstone he says like the same sun shine today will be ripening the grain for the harvest in july and this is how we don't look back in a negative way at what happened in prior ages same holy spirit same light but it's advanced he says but that light won't today won't do any good back there in july it's stronger the wheat is more advanced it's ready to take it that's good amen touch somebody and say i'm ready to take it no don't we're social distancing but you can say that in your hearts you said i'm ready to take it well it's more advanced it's stronger the wheat is more advanced it's ready to take it certainly is they couldn't take it now it can then the season wasn't right then is now he says they couldn't take it then now is the time the season wasn't right then it is now so the sunlight is bright shining in its fullness at its peak in its greatest intensity so he's using the analogy of a harvest that if the sunlight shone in the intensity back in the beginning of the of the of the season like it is now it would burn it it would kill it up it wasn't ready but the church has matured to the place now through the opening of the word of god we can receive this intensity we can take it while we've come higher up the ladder it's stronger what is the light and the wheat it's more advanced it's ready to take it not just the sun but the wheat oh let's uh let's let's look at let's look into the word and say i can take it look at the floors that i can take i was made for this i was built for this my spiritual dna it can only be activated with this let it shine let it radiate let it come lord let the full force of the word hit me not because i'll wither not because i can be shaken but because i'm ready to take it the light is stronger but i'm more advanced praise the lord so then brother branham is identifying and maturing now to where it has been precept upon precept where it's now those who had stammering lips and the and the brother identifies the stammer lips as pentecost the day of pentecost joel 2 28 and this is restored in the laodicean church age there's a an advancement now now listen to what he says as about pentecost he's writing or he's preaching this actually when he preaches the thigh tire and church age he preaches the revelation of jesus christ and december of 1960 he says look at them cold and formal we don't have to talk about baptists and presbyterians we know they've been dead for years yeah and i guess that's true maybe we don't talk too much about presbyterians or baptists and not that we talk about them but brother ben i'm saying we're not we see that the life has moved on that they've denominated they've organized they deny certain things and they they're rejecting uh certain manifestations of the gift they're rejecting the liberty of the holy spirit that just lets me know how long i've been preaching when that thing fires up it's kind of like my own personal timer like it's not the blue screen of death just relax i'm still going but it's appropriate because that's what i want to start talking about is the death that's come to the church so thank you microsoft so he says we don't have to talk about the baptist and presbyterians he says they've been dead for years when luther had this his revival justification if he would have kept on this pentecostal great move now would have been the lutheran church if it just would have moved on the light would have come by sanctification had wesley followed in luther couldn't have followed that no sir they are already lutheran so then wesley come after wesley died then what happened they organized that and made wesley and methodist and all kinds of methodists had a great revival but when they throwed in the organization what happened then pentecostal come along speaking in tongues and bringing the restoration of the gifts what happened when pentecost come along speaking in tongues and bringing the restoration of the gifts they couldn't move westlands couldn't methodist couldn't called them devils so this is this is how it transpires the lutheran's called the west the methodist devils then the method is called the pentecostal devils and he says now what's pentecost done they the same the same thing they did and where are they at he says just as dead as a doornail who not the baptist not the presbyterians and i find that in the message sometimes those who uh um are you know brandomites they're baptocostals or penta baptists why because they take brother branham's baptist background and his pentecostal calling and they just become that but he says the baptists were dead as a door now and the pentecostals are just as dead as the door now and the scripture that brother adam uses to identify what transpired in the church age is revelations chapter 2 verses 21 to 23. he says and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and this is the last thing he says before he stands at the door knocks revelation repent therefore repent but he says i i because she's given a space to repent and she does not think about the grace from the moment that brother branham's ministry begin and he preaches to the laodicean church age with signs and wonders think about that time revelations 3 19 that's going forward to the church up until the end of 62 bible says it's the death of 62. what is it what do we find out in the indictment what do we see that unfolds later as his ministry progresses in the open of the word they're dead they're dead he was preaching repentance and because they did not repent he says i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and burden identifies the deadness of the church and the deadness of laodicea the deadness of pentecost is this scripture being fulfilled though it may be expressed in another age and to another church it's being spoken to the whole church of all the ages i will cast her into a bed and i will kill her children with death so the church the laodicean church the church is dead as a door now at the death of 62. and program says unspoken word is the original seed every man no matter whether he's the pulp priest bishop or whatever he is he dies because he's a hybrid that's exactly he was born between satan and eve every man was born between satan and eve i know that's a that's a weighty statement very very difficult but it's the truth he says call it whatever you want it was satan and eve the original word had nothing to do with it the original word was life by the time you're doing a good job you're picking the right songs the original word had nothing to do with the original word was life now why does man die because the original is hybrid so if there's death and label to see it that means the word has been hybrid he's hybrid and brought death and when the church today that's called themselves pentecostals called them baptists whatever they want to when they hybrid this word with dogma it produces a dead child she can't have no life in her she's dead and her children are dead she the church she laodicea are dead and therefore they have stillborn children they cannot bring forth there is no life in them amen that's what the message teaches us there is no more life in them now i i may be this may be a supposition on my part i may be speculating but i feel this is just a spiritual logic like we're just using a a reasonable faith if there could be life in them then we can stay in them if there's still life in them we could stay in them but brother branham plainly called us out of them out of denomination out of organization and this represents a dramatic shift and the indictment just nails it down at one time you could be in the baptist church at one time you could be in the upc church at one time you could be in any different church why god was using the system and god was using men of god and organization and denominations and people were coming to birth in pentecostal but listen there's something that transpires in the birth of 63. something that takes place where now revelations 18 4 is clear and distinct come out from among them there is no more life in them and so there has to be a transformation there has to be a moving on beyond it in order to come to a birth you have to come out of it otherwise you could be birthed in it and you can stay in it so this is i want to read a lengthy statement to you i didn't even look at what time we started he says now there's a and this is there's a man here that can turn on the light and you could go look at these sermons there's a man here that can turn on the light and then um and shalom and in these different sermons he preaches at the end of 63 in the beginning of 64 and these themes are repeated over and over again he says he was the word made light or became light so the word became light the word in that generation he was the word light of that generation because the prophets of old had spoke of him and here he come and vindicated he was the light of god spoken word all the prophets had said had been fulfilled in him the prophets back here with the word so all those scriptures that pertain to him when he came that word became light because he's the manifestation of it now he says all the prophets that have been spoken of him are fulfilled in him but they're still a mystery as he had declared to his servants the prophets that's held for this day that's the finishing so christ is the beginning of that mystery but there must be a finishing of that mystery he said like god was at the beginning so now he's drawn the parallel to christ in his day to the beginning when god said let there be light and light came now the prophet said a virgin shall conceive bring forth a son they shall call his name emmanuel for to be god with us now they had spoke it the word had went out but he was the light what was he the fulfillment so what's light fulfillment the prophecy when it's uttered is not the light the fulfillment is the light the prophet as he prophesies is not the light the fulfillment is the light so you cannot say there will be light one day and that be light that light that word becomes light when it's manifested when it's fulfilled so whatever's being fulfilled is the light for that day that's how it wasn't luther wesley and pentecost the fulfillment is light he was the fulfillment of that word he was the manifestation of that word so is it today god's word has been fulfilled at the hour that's the light it's god manifesting himself amen just as it was at the beginning just as it was at the beginning of the creation of god these are the parallels we've been bringing up over and over in the beginning god then in the days of christ it brings it up again in the beginning of the creation of god christ is now following that pattern and now here we are today god's word has been fulfilled at the hour that's the light god manifested himself he was the light of the world christ was and when the prophets inspired by the holy ghost said unto us a child is born unto us a son is given a child is given his name shall be counselor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father there it was what was he the light that fulfilled that word the light that fulfilled that word in matthew 28 we find when jesus was raised from the dead he was also the light of the spoken word of david i'll not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption what's the light when the scripture's made manifest when the prophecy is being fulfilled so he says death was in darkness but he opened the seals of death and walked into it and come back out again he was the light the vindicated word that the dead can live after they are dead all right so this is what it stands for christ being the first fruits born again from the dead as he is now the first fruits of the resurrection as he is now himself identifying that the dead can live that they are dead the light of god's word vindicating that the dead can live after death he was on the day of pentecost that was the light that showed when the holy ghost came isaiah said in the 20th chapter precept must be upon precept line upon line hear a little and they're little hold fast to that which is good for with stammery lips and other tongues will i speak to this people and this is the rest this is the sabbath that i'll give so now he identifies isaiah 28 the verses that we read verses 9 to 11 verses 8 to 10 to 11 as the outpouring of the day of pentecost he says and this is the rest and all they would not hear walked away they wagged their heads and when the day of pentecost when the holy ghost fell upon those people they acted like drunk men and women staggering upon the impact of the holy spirit they walked away and wagged their heads and said this people is drunk full of new wine and so forth it absolutely was the light the word that had been prophesied made manifested so is it in every age so as the light was made manifest on the day of pentecost and that's the word made manifest is light so is it in every age the word made manifest come to life is the light of that age there the word made manifest just like it was in genesis 1 when god said let there be light and there was light when god said there will be a sun and there was the sun so then what is the light for today if he says it has to be in every age what is the light for today and he's he says he keeps pointing to the beginning in the beginning he said let there be light then he said there would be a sign and there was a son he's saying s-o in so he keeps pointing to the beginning and and i i believe that he does this because that's the true restoration point he does this because we are restored back to the church as it was on the day of pentecost and that was reflected in the restoration of the gifts the last order reformation brings back the leaves it brings back the fruit everything's been brought back in that but yet there's still one part that was lacking and that can only be seen in the potential that is expressed in the garden of eden in the beginning because brother brown says in the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised to be made manifest all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin so the woman that fell in eden the woman that fell after the day of pentecost the bride does not fall why it's very simple why she doesn't you are ordained not to it's just that simple you don't come up with any other reason well the reason why i won't fail is because i can do this and i can do that and i believe this i believe the seals are open and i believe this listen god ordained you not to he has predestinated you not to fail therefore you can take it i'm more advanced by his election by his predestination this is something that i can take you're elected to do it so he keeps pointing to a time or he's he's pointing to the beginning for us to understand our age because once again we're just like it was in the beginning darkness death obscurity and god speaks and there's light so in isaiah chapter 32 verses 3 to 3 and 4 and the eyes of them that shall see the eyes of them that see shall not be dim so they that have eyes to see they will not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearken so not all ears will hear no i all eyes will see but he that have eyes to see and ears to hear because some ears are dull some eyes are dim and they can't see see and they see not hearing they hear not but there are people who are possessed with the quality the eyes of them that see that means you have an eye that can see it will not be dim the ear that can hear it will hear so if something had been hid it'll be shown to you and because you have eyes to see you'll see it when it's made manifest what was not speaking before you had an ear to hear but yet it was not speaking and when it speaks you'll hear why because it's given unto you to know you have ears to hear you have eyes to see and you cannot see it unless it's made manifest you cannot hear it unless it speaks oh that's why i inspire you as the church of god to live the life to speak the word so that others may see and hear the reason why that person you know is stumbling around in darkness is because they have not yet heard the voice they have not yet seen the light and you are the voice you are the light not don't judge them because of their outward appearance and their circumstance they have an ear to hear they just need the word to be spoken they have eyes to say it was given to them by god they just need the light to shine and we hide our light when we walk by saying oh my goodness can you believe that sister and we just hide our light she's getting what she deserves when really what she needs is someone to let it shine and she's like i i've never seen this before i've never heard this before all along she had an ear to here all along she had eyes to see but something got in the way of the sun and the earth began to black it out but then god in this end time has set a city upon a hill for the purpose of salvation and he says the eyes of them that shall see shall not be dim and the ears of them that here shall hearken the heart also of the rash the expectant the scripture in the new testament talks about those who are looking those who are anticipating those are expecting shall understand knowledge remember the question unto whom unto whom shall i teach knowledge unto whom shall i make to understand doctrine now it's coming the heart of the rashford the expected shall understand knowledge and the tongue knows the dispensational change and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly i expected a big ring man the the the tongues the stamina the other tongues of pentecost it's a move of god because that's where the light of god was but there's still a dimness there's still a lacking there's still in part paul even teaches that brother branham even shows it but then there's a time when the full word is going to be unveiled there's a time when the full light is going to be shining and the heart of the rash the expectant once they understand knowledge once this doctrine is taught once the teaching comes once the full word is born into manifestation the tongues that once stammered are now loose to speak plainly it represents a change from pentecost to perfection from laodicea to bride the tongue of the stammers is ready to speak plainly brother says in the invisible under the bride of christ and yes certainly this uh this quote can be misused but he says the word that fell on the day of pentecost will not work this day that was for pentecost that means there's got to be something added to it or something more advanced something has to open up upon those shoulders what did he identify pentecost as the lips the tongues the layout of the scene age it was in the lips right but he says we're in the eye intelligence headship that's where we've come it says the word that from the day of pentecost will not will not work this day that was for pentecost this is for the bride going home of the bride we got something different the pentecostals represented that again laodicea represented that again in a last order of reformation in a godly way in a divine way not in a an unrighteous way in a powerful way if they aren't who they were we can't be bride if they weren't pentecostal then we have to be the pentecostals and it's not going home time yet if we follow the message teaching he says this is for the going home of the bride if we are the true pentecostals and those in the beginning of laodicea weren't then we're still waiting for something else to happen for it to be rapture season for it to be harvest time and i would say we have grossly grossly misunderstood the message because brother braham is clearly i orient in us we are in the brightest the pentecostals represented again we are in the bright age no more than the word of noah would have worked in the day of moses no more than moses's law would have worked in the time of paul he tried to tell him you were dead to that you cannot have it paul told them you are dead to that you cannot have it if i can say it another way it's dead to you it's not yours it's dead that's not where the life is don't reach back and grab it whatever benefit whatever power whatever promise whatever potential was in it is in the present truth so you don't have to go to something in the past to get it if you want blessing if you want gifts if you want power if you want true worship if you want a move of god find it in the revealed word find it in the present truth it's there if people who've used the language of the present truth people who use the language of the open of the word didn't have it following it's because man took it out and it's a form and a semblance but where the word of god is there's worship where the open of the word is there's healing where the power of god is present there's manifestations man's the one that would take them out man's the one that would make a mockery of it so if we want it don't reach back to something in the past to have it stay in the word and let me tell you the devil sure tries to beat you up and bully you to reach back but don't do it brother braham says in the third seal we have denominational revivals but we've had no real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions of church members but not wearing revival nowhere no no seven knows perfect right we've had denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no sir no and then he says it again not a revival nowhere no no because we've had many churches churches brides brides churches brides but there must come one so he says the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there now there's been church revivals church age revivals but now i i just noticed this it's march 3rd march 20th of 1963. revelations 3 20 behold i stand at the door knock now brother branham don't make anything out of that it's just brother bam standing there and he says the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of god disturbed the bride yet the church in each age has been stirred but a bride's revival hasn't happened yet so he says we're looking for it what is it then it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it so what is the bride's revival the open of the seven seals where's the bride's revival the revelation of the seven thunders so he resets he says where he promised it watch she was dead so the prophet gives the prognosis he says she is dead and what it's going to take to revive her is the revelation of the seven unknown thunders that's going to bring life into the bride so at the beginning of 1963 the church is dead this is the condition of the odyssey in church what is going to revive her it's going to take life the seven unknown thunders to wake her up and in the message he cares do you care he says we're at the end and we see we're at the end there's not no way to build upon that corruption how can we build a city upon the charred ruins of the sodom and gomorrah how can we do it man he cares do you care july 24th first 1963 how can we build a city upon the charred ruins of sodom and gomorrah how can we do it and then he says this there's only one phoenix left and that's the coming to the lord jesus he says you can't build on charred ruins but he says there's another phoenix what is he referring to well you could say in mythology it was this bird that could regenerate itself from ashes it's symbolized by the sun do we not call phoenix this area the valley of the sun the very symbols for the city of phoenix and that bird it's it's sun it's fire and in the mythology this phoenix obtained new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor so laodicea is and ashes laodicea is in ruins and the prophet says how can we build upon charred ruins how can there be how can there be anything he says but there is one phoenix left there is still yet arising of the sun even though there's ashes even though there's ruins there is another one there is another rising of the sun god is going to build up through the ashes and he says and i am the resurrection and the life he says gracious god great eternal jehovah who moved upon the waters and said let there be light you who spoke the world into existence by your word has promised by that same word that we shall rise again true words of these could be spoken at a funeral service these words could be spoken about they which are uh that go before us and those that sleep but it's also spoken in this last days over the charred ruins of laodicea there was another phoenix left it is the rising of the sun the same word that said let there be light in the beginning has spoken again and we have risen risen out of the charred ruins branham says and it is the rising of the sun he says who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and the confirmation of the word of god by god signs and wonders we see today that the book of luke 17 30 and malachi 4. this is what he's looking at luke 17 30 the coming of the son of man malachi 4 the forerunner of the messiah the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word is again waved over the people the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us giving us life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets because he is the light the vindicated word that the dead can live after they are dead so why is it waved it's waved over ashes seemingly why he's waved christ is the sheaf wave he's the word that's waved over the people a prophet there with the loaf waving it over the people showing what it's going to come there's more to come to maturity he's the sheath wave which is the evidence of the resurrection which is the evidence of the harvest which is the evidence of more seed to come to maturity it's the phoenix oh praise the lord he says he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church now no matter how you want to diagram this no matter where you want to put the comma i believe it all says the same thing his first coming was a bride coming because he came to purchase his bride he came to pay the price of redemption he came to redeemer the second coming he comes to receive his bride his third coming is with his bride they're all bride comings the first coming was a word coming was it not the word that came to john the baptist it was the word coming the second coming is a word coming the third coming which is what most people look to brother i said will be a word coming so don't let anybody use a language that tries to diminish the power of what you've received in this hour if it says in the bride coming out of the church or if you want to say in the bride christ coming in the bride or in the bride coming of christ however you want to look at it this is fulfilled in this hour this time the coming of christ in his bride or the bride coming to christ they'll have to be a sheep wave again in the last days why it was there in the first age first time waving of the sheaf the first one that come to maturity the first one to prove that it was wheat proved it was a sheaf i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people i know you're familiar with this he says that for the first time will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism there is another phoenix left it is the coming the bride coming of christ christ coming in his bride for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live ye live also speaking to his wife not to the church the bride his wife because i live you live also what a resurrection that was finish it with me and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead oh there was one more phoenix left oh hallelujah there has been a rising from the ashes arising even from the ashes of our predecessor she has risen upon the scene but everybody said she is risen what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power we've been raised up from the ashes of laodicea we've been raised up from the ashes of denominationalism we've been raised up from the ashes of false doctrines and that's why the devil is howling that's why the devil hates it when bread and christ is the mystery god revealed begins to talk about the devil howling he's howling at the the revealed truth the manifestation of this truth is in her and her alone he hates that he hates that this truth is manifested in the bride and the bride alone he can't stand it so all hell the devil is howling against it and he says about the devil howl and he says she is now risen by the power of the vindicated word promised to her what is he what is he howling against that she is now risen and let me find let me find an appropriate place to stop here i'd at least like to get to my text i don't like it when that happens and i don't get there i'm like why did i even have that why did i even have that there but brother brown makes a statement and go awake jesus and brother in one place said that pentecost has not recognized the awakening of the bride and who is he trying to awaken he that is in you he that is in in the right he that is in he that is in the ship wake him up so he's trying to awaken not jesus as the third person out there but awaken the christ in the bride he's trying to awaken the bride and he makes this statement there's more to the ministry than divine healing and he says the sickest body i know of tonight is the so-called body of jesus christ he says it needs spiritual healing and this quote is often used in present day language to suggest that the bride is still the sickest body there is and i've seen it used so that the person quoting it makes themselves relevant because you've got to come to me for healing but broadband said there's more to the ministry his ministry than divine healing he's saying there's spiritual healing divine healing can touch everyone divine healing is to anyone who will come up in a prayer line who will believe who can have their hands laid on them that that's for everyone but the sickest body i know is the spiritual body of christ he's saying there's more to my ministry than laying hands on the sick in the physical body recovering my ministry is to heal that sick body so he says it needs spiritual healing there's only one bomb that i know of that will heal that's the word and that's the body that we want to stand up in the strength and vitamin power of the gospel and that's why i use much of the time now is trying to strengthen the church by the word oh they may have wanted more prayer lines they may have wanted more signs and wonders of healings and manifestations but he says i'm spending more time in the word why because there's more to this ministry than prayer lines and laying hands on the sick but i have a ministry to heal the body of christ with the vitamin power of the word of god so i want to strengthen the church by the word and i say he has done it the bride of christ is no longer the sickest body on the face of the earth as he says it november 30th 1963 i believe when he came to that definitive place that he now knew what the third pull was it was the open of those seven seals not just an instance in which someone gets all riled up and speaks something and create something in this end time but then the third pull had come into full manifestation it was the opening of those seven seals the revealing of those seven thunders so he says that's why i spend my time in the word is because i want them to stand up why he was fulfilling malachi 4 2. but unto you that fear my name shall the sun essent of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall you've matured now whereas calves are in a stall but now it's ready to be loosed now you can go forth because the son of righteousness has arisen with healing in his wings and at that day our text and at that day shall the death hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness why because brother branham said it's genesis 1 2 again darkness obscurity spiritually she's dead as a door now it's death it's death but then the book is opened and the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind see out of darkness out of obscurity he said now that the seals are open the spirit of truth directs us to the word that's death and darkness is being defeated genesis 1 2 the spirit of truth directs us to the word he said that explains why all the mistakes have been made through the ages because the seals were not open isn't that wonderful so now that the seals are opened no more mistakes because the only reason why there was mistakes because the seals weren't open maybe that's why some people don't want them opened right that's why they want them to be like a clear bag like a candy bag it's sealed but you can see inside of it because as long as it's sealed you can justify your mistakes he says that's the reason why these mistakes were made the seals were not open this was not revealed but now that it's revealed ii thessalonians 2 8 then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now i want to i want to i'm going to continue to go forward and i know it's late it's already in the afternoon but i want to go forward so if you need to stand and you need to shake yourself or whatever it is you need to do i i'm not i don't plan on taking too much more time but i want to slow down for a second this scripture is fulfilled for us you'll find even brother branham has asked the question is second thessalonians 2 8 was that fulfilled in the first seal brother said yes because that's what the seals revealed that wicked one riding out for the church ages the church thought the white horse rider was christ but the seals are open it's like no it's the antichrist so then we understand and know the workings of the antichrist from the beginning he says and that wicked one shall be revealed not made manifest to the whole world yet whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming to consume it means to destroy with the spirit of his mouth is that god speaking will destroy it so when god speaks it destroys this wicked one and what is it that happens at the opening seven seals it's god speaking and he that has an ear the death shall hear the words of the book and when the words are spoken to her heart it destroys the power of the wicked one he is consumed with the spirit of his mouth revelations 1 16 and he had in his right hand seven stars which are the seven messengers to the seven church ages and out of his mouth so now it's just not stars anymore but it's his mouth out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword whom the spirit whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth what is that two-edged sword it is the word of god he's speaking now in the end time and what is it doing it's destroying the works of satan and it says in his countenance was as the sun as the sun shineth in his strength it's the son of righteousness with healing not just physical healing but spiritual healing whom the lord shall consume with the brightness of his coming the brightness of his coming that's the glorious manifestation of god that's the epiphany the shining forth it is the revelation of jesus christ it is him shining in his strength and brother branham takes this very scripture and he connects it with revelation 1 16 he connects with revelations 21 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof what city is that you amen the bride the new jerusalem the glory of god doth lighten it why it's the brightness of his coming destroying the works of satan in the patmos vision when brother bran preached it he connects revelations 1 16 with revelations 21 23. so i'm going to close i'm i i've grabbed the handle of the door and i'm shutting it let me say let me say this you aren't blind you can see you aren't sick you're healed whatever whatever lie whatever situation whatever whatever it might be you aren't dead you're alive because that's the message the cycle's been broken and can't you see then in this context can't you see how the devil is trying to abuse you with denominational darkness whether it be your own memory of your past and trying to overwhelm this the enemies come in like a flood it's a flood of darkness but when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up the standard against it and that standard means it causes the flood to be put to flight as if light is chasing away darkness and so the spirit of the lord in this end time has raised up a standard against it so listen no matter how much you may feel that you're blind you aren't blind you can see no matter how deaf you may feel you're not deaf you can hear no matter how sick you may feel you're not sick you're healed no matter how dead you may feel you're alive and the same goes for anyone else who may seem to be in the same condition because in revelations chapter 22 verses 16 and 17 it says i jesus has sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches now think of that we had an angel come to us who was likened unto one who was a star in the hand of him one of those seven stars says i have sent my angel to testify unto thee unto you these things in the churches brother branham came and had a testimony of these things in the churches but he also had a ministry to introduce him so now he says i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star not just merely a testimony of what was in the churches but now behold i stand at the door and knock revelations 4 1 come into me accept with me i am the root and offspring of david and the bright and morning star and then after he's made known then after he declares himself as this and the spirit and the bride say come now she speaks in unison with him now they're speaking together why i am the root and the offspring of david the bright and morning star she stands there with them in his glory so now the spirit and the bride say come and he says let him that heareth say come if you've heard then you likewise invite and you say come and listen i think it's so beautiful let this be our testimony come and let him that have thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely that's our message we're not a broken cistern we say come he says i sent mine angel the angel of revelations 10 7 why the mystery is finishing and now the bride is speaking in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and in the ending there's now a finishing it's the alpha and omega that's why i thought sister melissa special was so perfect finished well because who's finishing you are is are we going to watch jesus cross the finish line how is he the finisher in you he's the author and the finisher in the beginning now in the ending brother luke did you have the website the never ending beginning is that what it was for your wedding when he and sister rachel were engaged he set up a website is it still live i mean am i putting in a plug should we put some seo on this monetize it the never-ending beginning it's a perfect description and he used it in reference to his own natural union with his wife but what did it speak of this is something that will never end something unfolding something continuing but now we've we finished the mystery of it when christ says the things pertaining to me shall have an end he's not saying one day they're going to flip the switch and i'm going to be gone he's saying the prophecies that pertain to me will be finished they'll have an end they'll be they'll come to a clinic they'll come to a manifestation and the same with the mystery it's coming now in the ending it's the finishing and then once it's finished then eternity is dawning oh this is i i felt so compelled to end with this statement now i i've been i've been threatening now i'm i'm going to fulfill the threat what was assault is now battery because assault you just have to be in an imminent threat of harm so assault you just have to pretend to punch somebody and that could be assault so you're saying brother aaron can i suit yes you can sue yeah that's all the answer to can i sue is always yes but battery is when you actually do it so i'm actually closing if not you can sue me for assault brother branham writes this in the church age book and he says he had a dream and he says i saw a man that i supposed was my father do you do you understand how powerful the inference of authority is to the human the human mind where there's the inference of authority they have found that authority can make humans do all sorts of horrible things to other humans and they've actually done thought experiments where they give someone the inference of authority and they tell somebody turn that button up to a one and when you turn that button up to a one there's a person in another room who's gonna receive an electrical shock and so they say turn it up to number one the person goes one and you hear a guy go and they say two and hear up three oh now i want you to crank it up all the way to ten and with the inference of authority they're like wow and you hear someone going ah and the person does it without saying is this gonna harm the person is this really the right thing to do but because there's an inference of authority because they tell you they're your spiritual husband because they tell you they're your father in the gospel because they tell you they have authority over you with the inference of authority you suppose that they are your father he says i suppose that was my father he was a great big burly man i also saw a woman who was supposed to be my mother but she didn't i but she didn't look like her even as the man did not look like my father this man was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it you know when you take a log and set it up on an end and hit it with an axe it makes a three cornered wedge like piece of firewood it was like that he would take this club and hit her with it and knock her down as she would lie there crying he would walk around with his chest stuck out and on his face with such a proud boastful look that he appeared to take great pride and satisfaction in beating up a poor little woman and every time she tried to get up he would hit her i did not like what he was doing but as i considered stopping him i thought i can't tackle that man he's too big then he's supposed to be my father the inference of authority kept was working on him to keep him from standing up he said but down on the inside i knew he wasn't my father and i knew that no man had a right to treat a woman like that i went over and grabbed him by the caller and i turned him around and i said you have no right to strike her and when i said that my muscles grew and i looked like a giant do you realize what happens when you stand up for your god-given rights when you realize that you have opportunities that saint paul never dreamed of when you recognize your rights when you stand up to the devil he goes you have no right to strike her when i said that my muscles grew and i looked like a giant the man saw them and then he was scared of me i said you strike her again and you'll deal with me he hesitated to strike her again and then the dream left me let me say this i thank god that a little man about 5 8 an uneducated man from kentucky had enough audacity and enough courage to grab that bully by the caller this laodicean church age all these denominations all these organizations and all these bully pulpits and he grabbed him by the caller and he says you have no right to strike her and if you do you have to deal with me i thank god he did that and i believe every man of god who's ordained to preach the gospel must follow in this same line and carry on the same legacy we are set for the defense of the gospel and therefore we're set for the defense of the bride no man has a right to treat her wrong you have no right to strike her then he interprets it the woman represents the church of the world today he says i was born right into the mess that's the mess she's in she was supposed to be kind of a mother she is the mother of harlots her husband is the denominations that rule her the three corner block is a false triune baptism of a trinity every time she started to rise up that means the congregation began to accept truth he would drive her right down again with that false doctrine he was so big that i was afraid of him at first but when i came against him i found out i had great and powerful muscles they were faith muscles the outcome of the dream was that since god is with me and give me strength and can give me strength let me stand up for her against the denominational power of the world and make him quit striking her i thank god for that let us do the same since god is with us and he can give me strength let's stand up stand up for the hurting stand up for the loss stand up for her against any power of the world and make them quit striking her you're going to have to leave that dynamic so there's got to be someone to stand up to it i say just even as that song was sung let the church arise and finish well she said let the church arise and let's lift the banner of christ let's stand to our feet today sister lord if you could come thank you for being patient giving me the opportunity to finish this light has come to defeat the darkness i want to sing i've been thinking of amazing grace in the kit of f it's a song that's just been in my heart what amazing grace in that dave the lord would lead we might amplify it more next sunday and that day shall the death hear the words of the book why because the church is dead but then something happens and life comes that's the time we're living in now that's what we're walking in and i believe this message stood up to the darkness of laodicea [Music] god says god is with me and can give me such strength we can look to the scripture that says we're living in a time where we can take it the light of the sun that's shining now it's stronger but the weed is more advanced so it's ready to take it god is with me and can give me strength let me stand up let me rise up and lift the banner of christ let's pray a word of prayer and then we could even make it a dismissal prayer our gracious heavenly father lord we're so grateful to be standing up that as the elect in this last day we're not laying around but we're standing on our feet like a great army and not merely are we a great army in a valley which was one time dead dry bones but now we've been animated by the voice of god and the son of man has prophesied and we've been raised up and now we're walking in the light of the truth and now we can have fellowship in the mystery pray lord that you strengthen the people that have come lord if there's been any obscurity or misunderstanding in my delivery lord if there's been any uh uh edge by the tone of my voice may you make it clear upon the here's ears lord and in their heart that a rebuke of baptist the rebuke of denomination the rebuke of organization [Music] rest squarely upon the promise that in this last day you would open up a new land a new message not closing a door but opening the door lord may we stand for true father not water it down but may we not obscure truth lord for in this our ears can hear and eyes can see the voice of god and the light of god shine in this end time we commit the people to you today whether sick and body or needy in their minds we believe the word is enough and upon whatever basis we need to meet you lord whether it be hands being laid on coming forward in prayer lord oil being being anointed with oil whatever whatever the steps would be in your word that we should walk through father we're believers we can walk in them we commit the people to you now at the close of the service as we soon depart bless us as we worship in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
