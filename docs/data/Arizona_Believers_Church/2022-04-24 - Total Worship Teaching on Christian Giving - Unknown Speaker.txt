TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um my title is uh total worship and teaching on christian giving and we're going to be exploring this morning the subject of tithes and offerings and just felt the lord really impress it upon my heart to do so yesterday had other things that we were prepared to minister but then this subjects it seemed relevant especially some of the things that we want to talk about this afternoon the deacons are going to be sharing some things trustees and in some of the things that they might be expressing i think would be important for us to have this kind of background and it's actually some things that i thought perhaps i would was going to share with the church i'm actually just going to do it this morning through the word of god so it's on total worship and that's the first part i really want to look at but we're looking we're teaching on christian giving and it's a vast subject and i believe it's a subject that deserves attention if it's in the word of god if it's uh if it's part of god's word then it deserves our attention and it certainly is deserving of our understanding and there is uh it's important to recognize as i'm kind of titling it christian giving or using that phrase to describe our tithe and offerings uh it's important to recognize our duty to those things maybe even more importantly our liberty in pursuing those things and doing those things and then the blessing that's related to our giving unto the lord so there's a part we want to recognize that it's a duty but then also recognize the liberty that we have as christians to do it that may seem paradoxical but there's things that's required by the word but yet we have that liberty we're released to do it and there's certainly a blessing in it if you look at genesis chapter 4 i want to start here and this begins to develop my thought on total worship and how this is connected with worship and genesis chapter 4 verses 3 and 4 it says in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof so both have offered something it means that offering means a gift or a tribute a present and they're doing it unto the lord as an offering unto the lord so this is an expression of tribute to the lord or present to the lord it is an expression of worship to god and i'm going to be maybe mentioning this over and over again but no there's no written law there's no um explicit commandment that we see that there must be an offering or worship made to god so both cain and abel do this to god it says the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering so they worship god and and they're pouring out this uh we can say praise to him giving these gifts to him and honoring him it says in hebrews chapter 11 verse 4 by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he attained witness that he was righteous god testified of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh and so there's something that was even i want to look at it in two ways we know that the blood of abel speaks and the uh as we see in the scripture but then there is a something that the offering speaks of as he offers this up to the lord by faith abel offered a more excellent worship a more excellent sacrifice god recognized and testified of that gift and that present and so even his offering is speaking to us that it holds some truth or some relevance to us and when it says by faith abel offered we know it's by revelation that he worshipped so abel worshipped by revelation in his offering in his gift-giving he's not compelled by law he's not compelled by fear but by revelation he offers up the sacrifice to god and it is this image of abel's offering uh that the in this very first offering that even the offerings of the sacrifices and the offerings of the law reflect back to so when abel makes this offering it is even foreshadowing the ceremonial laws of offerings and sacrifices that israel partake in hundreds of years later and so we know it speaks of a greater sacrifice christ but intervening in there is all the types and symbols of the law in which they offer so it's this offering this worship the sacrifice to god it's by revelation it's it's from it's to honor god and to give him praise and i believe the act of giving as a christian under the new covenant is an act of worship in the same way that abel comes by revelation uh we too worship the lord in spirit and in truth and it's important to catch that your giving unto the lord is part of that worship in the new testament there's actually three different words that are used for worship and i want to i want to establish this if you could um at the very beginning maybe you may know exactly where i'm going you may have heard it all before uh let's just pretend we're facing this for the first time um and then or you imagine that our neighbors next door in the apartment next door are visiting this morning and you want them to get this so you're pulling with everything you can you're saying lord please help them to understand this but this is a very important foundation that i want to lay and i want this to hold right in the center of your thoughts in these three different words that are used in the new testament i'm not going to share the greek with you but the first word that's used of worship means to show homage or to give reverence there's another word that's translated to worship it means to show devotion or to revere and then there's another word that's translated to worship it means to serve or to offer gifts or to perform service and in each one they kind of share in the similar thought to show reverence or homage to pay homage or honor to show devotion or to offer gifts or to perform service that third word is used here in philippians chapter 3 verse 3 for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh so we worship we offer gifts we perform service we serve god that's the word that's used we which worship god we serve him we offer up things to him we perform service to him we do it in the spirit and worship as we hear the word frequently used i want to definitely make the point that it's it's more than just our songs it's more than lifted hands we hear worship most often the context of music so we have a worship leader we have worship songs you have a worship playlist and we use worship to speak more to the dynamics of song service than maybe the whole idea of our lives being a worship the whole idea of us offering our very lives as a sacrifice and even our words and our dress and our activities everything being a worship to the lord revelations chapter 16 verse 2 this may be a curious place to start in laying this foundation and it says in the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell in noisome and grief is sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast upon them which worshipped his image so many other scriptures we could have brought into this picture but i wanted you to see that the mark of the beast is upon them that worship the image of the beast and this worship of this worship of the beast it's to uh worship if i could say it this way and i'll bring it back to a statement worship is your belief in action and so your worship is your belief in action it's it's your conviction that's evidenced by some sort of support um some sort of activity or works expressed what your conviction and your faith is and so here it said that they had the mark of the beast and they worshipped his image and brother banam wrote this in the church age this book this mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the church system which is trinitarianism etc and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the world church so catch that the expression of worship is in to believe but then it's also in to do the will of so it's in believing something and it's in the support of it this is the expression of worship uh this is devotion to the false image is to uh is to believe something but then show your support in it or do the will of it and that and i'm wanting just to see that that's what worship is it's to believe something when you believe in something and you have a conviction of it that's why a lot of people's worship is empties because there's no faith associated with it and and that's why a lot of people's worship is hollow in that it's not followed by services there's not some performance or to do the will of god with it and gabriel's instructions to daniel i'm just going to take a deep breath and slow down i think i'm nervous it says in gabriel's instructions to daniel he says i like to worship don't you we don't come to church just to hear a sermon i think we the preachers need to hear that we don't come to church just to hear a sermon he said that goes with it but we come to church to worship worship in the spirit and in truth so you certainly want your sermon to be a part of that to facilitate that to even provoke a response of worship he says you've heard the truth that's the word now to worship is to express yourself to him amen that's what worship is worship is an expression of yourself to him and just by using that phrase though it's in the context of a church service the word has gone forth now express yourself to him you could take that definition of worship worship is to express yourself to him and find out that i can be worshipping him every time i breathe at all moments because what i want my life to be is a song to him what i want my life to be as a sweet savior to him i want my life to be an offering as paul says present yourselves present your bodies as a sacrifice as an offering as a worship to god and so the way that i live the way that i talk the way that i act the way that i treat others is expressing myself and i want to express myself to him i want to worship him in the message all things brother brahm says today our tradition is taking the power out of our worship by our own traditions we're taking the power out of our worship and so traditions and the wrong kind of mentality or any kind of approach to worship can take the power out of your worship so there's power in worship worship is to express yourself to him and what can hinder that is tradition and it's really interesting what can make something a tradition it may not be the act itself that makes it tradition but it's your mindset towards it communion and feet washing is by no means a tradition it's a commandment in the word of god it's something that i'm very excited to do together as a church in the next month and it's uh it's something we do because it's in the word of god but it's very easy to take the word turn it into a tradition and make it of no effect just by our traditions make the word of god and no effect or you're doing the semblance of it but you take the power of it away just by making it tradition by approaching it with the mindset well we have to do this by approaching it absent-mindedly just doing it and if we're not coming to church under expectation if we're not coming to church because we believe god's going to meet us here and the word's going to go forth if we're not coming with an attitude that this is in your words you promise to meet us here and there's and associated with certain promises and recognizing there's a pull in your heart to do that and to be here and be a part of it then you make even that prophecy and that scripture traditional and when you make it tradition you take the power right out of it and so when we worship we do not worship under the law we do not worship under a tradition because worship in itself is not a man-made idea to worship is not a man-made invention or construct it it is something that is related to god and proverbs chapter 3 verse 9 it says honor the lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of thine increase so you're to honor the lord worship the lord with what you've gained uh get what you the in your thy substance your riches your mammon and and it says uh and with the first fruits of thine increase so this is a and he's alluding to the tithe and to offering so honor the lord with thy substance when you have substance when you have increase when you have uh wealth riches and possessions he says honor him with them though the things we own the things that we entertain ourselves with we want to give some thought as to whether or not we're honoring the lord with it and it says and with the first fruits of thy increase so there's a giving that's as it alludes to the tithe and an offering of your substance an offering of your increase to the lord and then notice the blessing that comes with it so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine this is a promise connected with offering and giving thy lord honor the lord with your substance worship him honor him and give to him and then with the first fruits of thy increase and your barns will be filled with plenty your presses shall burst out with new wine this is god promising that if you honor him with your substance and you give of your increase that he will increase your increase he will bless your presses he will fill your barns with plenty and this is this honor it's worship the lord with it you're going to worship and praise and offer thanksgiving and we uh we had a number of scriptures lined up just to show the different offerings in the old testament that are just praise they're just thanksgiving they're given to him to glorify him to send up adoration and a sweet aroma to him the very offering itself is an act of praise in the old testament in the message of total deliverance brother graham's telling a story how some men set up a foundation and in setting up this foundation they wanted to give money to certain causes and he says and they called me to oakland for a meeting and they had the money they'd sponsor it all in their foundation and i'm just providing the key phrase here brother fred and i tried for some money that brother fred had that i would not take as an individual so then we decided we'd give it to the canadian people and not even take up an offering so you notice what's happening is someone wanted to help support the meetings they were going to take this money put it through this foundation to support the meetings and not even have to take up an offering in the meeting he says but it didn't go so good the meetings were fine but because we didn't take up an offering he says i don't care if the church is worth a hundred billion dollars you still owe it to god to take up an offering if the church was worth a hundred billion dollars if someone wants to claim that by faith we're not going to stop you but we'd still have to take up an offering right he says i don't care if the church is worth a hundred billion dollars you still owe it to god to take up an offering that's part of the worship so taking up the offering in these meetings he said ah you know the meetings were fine but because we didn't take up an offering it didn't go so good he noticed there was something different he says you rob as much as i've been against money and things like that i find out when a man's wrong you might as well admit you're wrong because brother fred and i seen it pan out not so good so brother is admitting that just taking someone who's wealthy or taking some donations and find it through a certain channel so it could pay for everything and not give the opportunity for the people to give reduce the quality of the meetings just to use that kind of language it didn't pan out so good and he's himself willing to admit you know what we had the money it paid for everything nobody was burdened with it but if you don't uh if you don't you still owe it to god to take up an offer and he says the meetings weren't what they could be because he didn't take up an offering and this is the part i want you to say it's part of worship the very act of giving is part of worship and the message jehovah miracles again i'm just providing you with the the key word here that you could ponder as we lead up to it and the so brother he's in a conversation with the brother he says well i'll tell you what i'll do i'll just take the check and you'll come and go to the meeting we won't have to take up one offering or anything i said that's fine i'll do that then said i did that and it was not a success so think of that how uh how he expresses this but john you could go ahead and show the part so they know what i'm coming to he says i did that and it was not in excess people have to have something in the meeting and i think it's important to think about this and not just in the context of holding special services but just in the meeting in your participation and you're coming to church it's their meeting and they'd meet me on the street and ask me what's the matter with this meeting we haven't got no part into it they don't even take up an offering no this is wonderful that the people's attitude they come they hear the word of god they see miracles signs and wonders happen and there's still a part of them that feels a little bit empty because they wanted to participate in the meeting by giving and he says the people as i mentioned a moment ago the people have to have a part they have to have something in the meeting he says people have to have something in the meeting he says they don't even take up an offering so an offering is a part of worship to take up an offering to give people an opportunity to give is a part of worship he said that's right i know more than ever since the other day when i was going to give hattie right back that 20 that she pledged towards the new tabernacle in jeffersonville the lord said just let her alone why would he do that oh because she's poor she doesn't have means she could really use the money and here of her own free will she's wanting to give a building fund donation something to help the new tabernacle and brother branham's going to tell her give it back to her tell her not to and the lord says stop don't do it because we might look at things in a very carnal way that well you only give if you have uh you know you shouldn't have to give you're too poor you're this or you're that or use it for something else whatever the carnal attitude might be and it might be you not wanting to give because you have certain ideas and reasons why you don't want to give and the lord's attitude was leave her alone let her give amen he says a few minutes later i see why he let her alone so i just made a promise in my heart i was never going to try to stop anybody that wanted to give something towards the kingdom of god i did it many times turn it down just as fast as i could and i've realized that i have robbed people by doing that because god had a program for that so we can rob god and not give him but then you could also rob the people by not letting them have the opportunity to give and i know we've heard these statements before and i wanted to rehearse them to you it's often said i know in our family and we've heard it i know sister elizabeth she was raised it was taught to her this way that an offering to take up tithes and offerings even in the church service is part of our worship he says an offering is a part of worship that's part of the worship to take up an offering then the message of man running from the presence of the lord he says if there's any strangers with us we've made that a policy to never beg bum push people for money we pass the collection plate which is a religious act he says i've tried it many times not even to pass the complexion collection plate at all but it don't work he said i've tried not to pass it but you know what it doesn't work he says because giving is a part of our religion it's part of our duty so this is part of our religion it's part of our duty and so there is a religion which is pure and undefiled what does even paul teach us that it's the pure religion pure unfollows to visit the widow in her affliction and so there's there's a visitation to the poor there's a an assistance and aiding those and others so par part of our religion and part of our duty even in those who perform the service and even those that are in the service to pass the collection plate as he says and to give he says no matter if it's just a dime or whatever it is or a penny he says so you see when people want to give you've got to give them the opportunity to do so he says but i think that we have to pass the offering plate notice this phrase i wanted to provide it in order to make it a complete religious service this is a phrase that's very familiar to us that a church service is not complete without taking up an offering now does this does this require does this establish a law that a church you have to pass the offering baskets in order uh for there to be you have to have someone come and pray over the ties and offerings pass out the plates in order for there to be uh total worship or for the service to be complete i don't believe he's trying to establish a law but i do believe you want to give people an opportunity to give having some opportunity for people to give to support it's part of our duty if you don't if you don't it doesn't work we read it a moment ago how he we tried but it didn't go so good and i i have to just admit when i've been wrong when i've tried to do something that doesn't quite pan out it's when you haven't given people the opportunity to give and i would even say that uh and then even i want to come back to that's what completes the service we are we gather together to worship the lord and having that opportunity to give and even your giving completes the service completes the worship it makes it a total worship when we come and we participate in our our praise and the lifting of hands and the songs that are sung and the leadership of different things that's all part of our praise and when we're able to give in our we've given with our time we've given with our lips we've given with our clapping and our attention and everything and then when we've given even of our substance and we've honored the lord he says even if it's just a dime or whatever we're completing that service and i would even say that if there's a giving people an opportunity to give and to complete this religious service is a part of our duty it's important that we understand what it is and this off an offering is a part of worship if you say he just given a dime just give it a dollar well what are you giving it for if there's a thermometer a meter next to it showing how much money is going to be raised in your giving to get the needle up so that you fill up the thermometer then that's probably not worship if you're giving because someone's twisted your arm if you're giving because it's a it is a cover charge right if given because you have to pay for your seat um and because you want to get in well we'll let anybody who doesn't want to have to sit on the front row you pay 50 bucks you won't sit on the front row that's not a that's not worship that's not an offering that's a tax uh under under a uh under compelling you or something under the wrong kind of compilation is what i'm thinking just the wrong kind of force and so in genesis chapter 14 this is a story of abraham meeting melchizedek verses 18 to 20 the melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god now we know who this melchizedek is it is it is god in flesh and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and abraham as the bible tells us abraham gave says abraham gave him tithes of all now when abraham gave there's no law there's no commandment there's no ordinance but he gives and what is he doing he's worshipping melchizedek he came and he brought forth bread and wine and here now in an act of thanksgiving and he realizes that it's god who's delivered his enemy into his hands it's god who's brought the spoils here's abraham's not dividing uh the things that he recovered he's giving those back to those who had lost but now the spoils of the enemy he gives a tie the 10 as we would say to back to melchizedek it's an offering to him of his increase of these spoils and what is he doing it for it's not attacked so he can go home it's not a it's not just merely uh well since you stopped me since you gave me bread he's not paying for the bread and wine he's worshiping abraham is this is an act of reverence of service and honor given to melchizedek and in the old testament and in the new testament the act of giving of a natural substance even the giving of fruits and your increase is connected with this same worship abel offering up to god a more excellent sacrifice in genesis 4 abraham offering in genesis chapter 14. this is the very image of our giving as christians genesis 14 it was an act of worship expressing gratitude and thanksgiving to god and brother brown looks at this in hebrews chapter 7 part 1 and he makes a very uh he kind of asks a question that's very thought-provoking what would a man take tithings for if he was never born and ever will die and was from the beginning to the end never had no father a mother a descent and on the heavens and earth and all of it why would he take tithe that's a good question i mean why in the world does the prince of the priest of the most high god the king of salem need a tenth of the spoils that abraham just took from these other kings why would he do it why would he ask abraham to pay tithes you see what a strict thing it is to pay tithes tithing is right every christian is duty bound to pay tithe that's right never has been changed it's it's expressing something brother graham's identifying that in this very act of abraham offering up to god god was establishing what an important thing it was how much it was connected with our worship and how a god who doesn't necessarily need your money right you can give it still as a sacrifice you still give it as an offer and you give it as an act of worship and praise as the bible says in hebrews 7 4 now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of his spoils abraham worshiped god by giving a portion back to god he worshipped god by giving him substance the brother of him says this is showing us what a strict thing it is to do this he says every christian is duty bound to do it it's never been changed now remember that it's never been changed i think it's a very important statement especially in the light of um a lot of forceful teaching um a lot of um very uh i want to say intellectual but i don't want to put a a bad label on it but just efforts through the word of god and identifying things in the new testament and and trying to strict language in the new testament say well we're clearly not under the law which we're not right we're not under the law anymore and that the very laws that god gave to israel that would relate to tithing do not explicitly and are not imposed upon us as christians on the same duty as an israelite had to the temple the same duty that the israelites had to the levites but yet brother branham is saying that there's a duty expressed in abraham's offering pre-law right before commandment was given he offers up this offering and he says it's now a duty that's not the church choosing law for grace i want you to catch this he says suffers to pay the preacher where'd you ever get such a thing as that in the scripture there's such a thing as that scripture he says tithes pays the preacher he's to live by the tithes of the people that's important principle for us to understand your tithe is what allows the preacher to live your tithing is what allows a pastor to uh sometimes it's uh pastors have the opportunity to be full-time in ministry and it's the tithing of the people that allow that pastor to do funerals on a tuesday morning when everybody else would be at work or friday afternoon and do weddings and sometimes fly i've seen pastors do this i've done it even myself even when i wasn't a pastor fly overseas and perform weddings i was a texan officiating a sermon in germany for two people from ghana and that was unique very very unique lasted all day long nothing started on time and as soon as i was done they wanted me to go do something else saying nope take me to the hotel i'm not you fooled me once won't fool me again and and i still remember i had bread and water i thought i was staying in it was in berlin i thought i was staying in an old jail uh a jail converted to uh something like that that's what it felt like and for breakfast i had hot water and bread and it was very eye-opening to some of the things that the believers have to experience and how they live but this is what your tithing allows to happen it may be easy sometimes just to think well it's all surplus it's all excess but tithes paid the preacher he's to live off that but we had to get something else to do so now he's talking about how things have changed this whole modern approach we have to have our says we have to have our part into it and if they can't make it up then there's another society we'll do it in another society so just all the things that they try to come up with to pay the pastor he says in one place you know pay your tithes the pastor will be paid so he says god's way is right tithes and offerings go to levi which was the minister and i know he's using some very um summary language there if everybody would pay their tithe you wouldn't have to have any soup suppers you adopted something else and leave the tithings off say it's an old testament argument i'd like for you to prove it to me that's right you can't do it by order it can remain where we stand as believers if a prophet is going to take it look into the word of god and say that there's a there's certainly an application of the law but then he says no you can't just you can't just do away with it and say it's just an old testament argument something has survived in the new covenant and he says it's a new testament order too and as we read a moment ago it's part of god's program it's part of his order god has a program for that as he says so these are things that we are this is kind of where i realize i'm entering maybe into another juncture of this your your giving is worship it's part of your worship we see that established in the word of god and then now there is a it carries it's it's even part of our new testament worship you can't do it by god's word you can't prove it's just an old testament argument by god's word it's a new testament order too now where the difference comes or maybe where the the wrestling is arises is in the old testament it's very precise very clear very detailed in terms of giving the tithes or what we might even call offerings the different offerings that are given different types are different given are very detailed and very precise even to years in which they would apply even to the very things that they're applied to and even the percentage right the tithe even in itself is speaking of a tenth percent so there's detailed percentages that you can go into the old testament and say oh well this is how much percent you would need to give here this is how much percent you'd need to give here and so it's very detailed and even to the point to where it says well you want to give a tithe and if you can't carry it to the house of god convert it to money and then come and give it and so when it comes to tithing a lot of the questions are well do i tithe on net do i tithe on grows who do i give it to how do i how do i give it there's a lot of questions that relate to it because the new testament isn't as precise the new testament isn't as detailed and i want to say even though the new testament isn't as precise and detailed as the old testament it's the old testament that gives us the image or the model of our christian giving in hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 it says for the law having a shadow of good things come and not the very image of the things can never produce without those sacrifice which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and too perfect so we realize in the actual offerings and sacrifices the shedding of blood and the ceremonial sacrifices could never make the worshiper perfect but in that offering and in that worship and the shedding of blood it was a shadow of good things to come and it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come so it's not just that particular act of shedding blood and spilling out the blood of a ram or a bull upon an altar but it's the law itself that has a shadow so there's a true image if there's a shadow there's a true image that's typed out in the old testament tithing there's a true image that's typed out in the old testament offerings and we could we could spend a lot of time today in the new testament and i realized i'm so nervous and i'm going so fast that uh that i could have probably read all the all the first corinthians and second corinthians in the new testament in the language that paul uses of given he calls it bounty he calls it ministry uh um alms maybe another word that we might find in the bible there's different ways where paul is describing our giving and you'll find that his teaching on giving is drawing from the offerings and the tithes of the old testament wherever paul is admonishing to give you'll even find that when jesus is talking about tithing you tithe on mint and cumin and you you're so precise and all you're given you see the different instances where jesus is speaking of it it's all established in the old testament jesus kind of gives uh makes reference to it in the gospels and then paul when he's teaching the new testament church about giving and being mindful of giving he's drawing from the old testament paul isn't establishing new rules he's not inventing a different way of making the church work as a prophet he sees the image that the law provided the law having a shadow and he carries that image over into a a greater substance in the new testament church and really to me i think it's absolutely remarkable how there was such a rigid structured method of providing for and supporting ministry and maintaining the tabernacle imposed by law and by threat and coercion in some ways in terms of how you can be excommunicated and put outside the body put outside the camp so to speak in israel under the law how that paul catches the revelation of that and teaches it in principle to the church and how the new testament church the true body of christ has taken the substance of that shadow and perpetuated the faith for a couple thousand years it's amazing now the what paul is drawing on and this is where i want you to maybe even you know wet your wet your ink or get sharpened your pencil because in the old testament there were three different tithes that were given did anybody know that anybody knew that there's three different kinds of ties you're thinking i know where he's going he's going to say it's 30 now you got to give brother aaron 30 no it doesn't work that way it scaled a little bit because you do the percentages it's not quite 30 and adjusted for inflation we might be there we might be there at 30. but there's three tithes of the old testament that type our christian giving and this is where i believe the distinction is going to be very good for us because i know as i'm reading these statements a christian's duty-bound hate always says it's singular he talks about passing the offering plate it's a part of our worship all these different things and it would be real easy maybe first just to conflate them all and combine them all into one thought that well i write a tithing check and that's my worship or they pass the plate and i throw a few bucks on the offering plate that's my worship but there's paul draws from these three different tithes they're called tithes in the old testament and i want to break them down into their different sections so you could realize that it's this these three givings that have brother branham says or that i'm i'm going to say that when brother brown says it's carried over into the new testament it's a new testament order it's our giving as believers and as christians that is part of the new testament order and in the new testament it's even itself you can identify it's in these three areas that we give as christians that make up our total worship are part of our total worship not in themselves make it up but they're part of it now they're here they are i'm going to go over the three and then we'll go over them individually there was a tithe which was for the levites somebody say the priesthood the ministry there was a tithe for levites and that is a type of your tithing to the pastor type of giving your ten percent to the pastor or to the ministry so there was a tithe for levites that's a type of your tithing to the pastor then there was a second tithe that was for and the annual festival and in that and then also and i want to kind of combine with it these different feast offerings because they work they work kind of together so there was these an annual festival that they would come and they would bring their tithing to and we'll see how it was to support the function of the service and it's a type of our offerings to the church different distinct from our tithing but also a tithe or a giving to the tabernacle to the temple for the services for the the feast and then there was a third tithe that was called a tithe for the poor and that's most often the way that it was summarized even in the rabbinical literature and things as a tithe for the poor believe josephus even refers to it that way there was a tithe to the levites there was a tithe to the tabernacle to the festivals and then there was a tithe for the poor and that tithe for the poor is a type we could see a type of our giving to missions because when you give to missions where you're giving to a work or a need that is present where there's maybe not other um not other opportunities or resources so you're mindful of places that are poor or impoverished or don't have buildings or ministries that need support and it's even a type of things that we might do as a special offering to assist somebody to give to a particular need so there's these three different tithes in the old testament for the levites for the festival services and then one for the poor you got those down first let's look at this one for the tithe for the levites this was an offering to the lord for the benefit of those who ministered unto the lord so all israel would bring sacrifices you have to draw from your knowledge of how this the temple worked and how the priests and even the levites because not every levite entered into the priesthood but how they all worked to support uh um the offering and the worship of the people and so this was an offering unto the lord that the levites partook in because they're the ones that had no inheritance in israel and they ministered unto the lord there's different scriptures we could use but let's look at numbers chapter 18 just to cover this very quickly in numbers chapter 18 verses 20 to 24 and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of israel and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth of israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh to the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die so it's creating this distinction that the levites will perform the service they're the ones that allah for the sacrifices the rest of israel will pay tithe to them for their inheritance for their living but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations that among the children of israel they have no inheritance but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit evil it's lifting up i think in one place it's like a throw-in it's a lifting up it's a praise the things that they the tithes of the children of israel the children of israel do it they're offering up a heap offering unto the lord i want you to catch this he said oh well they're giving 10 to the preacher or they're giving 10 to the levites no they are giving as an offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit so it's given us unto the lord the levites then take responsibility for it you'll find this run through the message and i believe you'll find this is true with god's character that we have the responsibility as the worshiper to give the offering to give the heave offering unto the lord to give the tithe unto the lord and then once you give it that man will answer for how he uses it you won't have to answer how he uses it you give his unto the lord and you you have fulfilled your responsibility your obligation and then the man of god will answer for how he has used the lord's offering the tithes of the children of israel which they have offered as a heave off and under the lord so he says i the tithes of the children of israel i have given to the levites to inherit who gave it the lord has given it who's offered it the the children of israel who do they offer it to the lord an offering unto the lord and lord gives it to the levites this is this with this tithe which we use from that and i didn't want to get bogged down just in the wording of it but the tithe is it means this was meant to support the levites they were to take the the tithe and it would be their livelihood it would be their living it'd be their substance it'd be their food and and this is how they would pay the bills so to speak this is how they would live is offered this this offering of the children of israel to the lord that the lord would give as an inheritance to the levites and paul draws on this in galatians chapter 6 verse 6 he says let him that is taught in the word so you who are taught the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things it's a reference to you who are being taught communicate back to the teacher we say oh well does that mean to say amen it means to impart or share your means to me communicate means to impart to impart a share of your means to part a share of your substance so paul is using a language to say you who are taught communicate to those who are teaching or give a share of your means to him that is teaching now what what would paul be drawing on if he wasn't drawing from the very end of the old testament in which the children of israel gave an offering unto the lord and those that were offering the sacrifices lived by that as an inheritance he's drawn so if you are taught in the word of god share your means with the teacher and first timothy 5 17 to 18. this is maybe a more stark example that the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and doctrine and this is what he uses to substantiate it so we could we could drill down maybe more deeply on uh is it yeah verse i think maybe it's verse 17. i took some out there is it verse 17 anybody looking in their bible i'm glad people are still bible readers it's verse 17 i have 15 there say the bishop is just not blameless at all i have mistakes all over the place is it still cool in here it says for the scripture saith now this is the principle that he's alluding to but this i think stands to paul's conviction thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the labor is worthy of his reward so saying that if one is laboring in the word then don't deprive him substance don't leave him empty but he says he's worthy of his reward he's worthy of something to live by he's worthy of some substance and paul again this is in the image of the levites who served in the temple and there was an offering unto the lord that they partook and that gave them their substance to live by communicating to him that teacheth one who labors in the word and doctrine don't starve him don't deprive him the laborer is worthy of his reward first corinthians chapter 9 verses 13 and 14 you'll find a lot in first corinthians chapter eight nine second corinthians there's a lot that refers to our christian giving i'm not going to have time to cover it today as much as i would like to and i'll i will acknowledge i'm thankful that the lord has been given such a comfort and i would say even a boldness to speak on that because in my complexes i would just leave it alone and never even mention it and uh and just say you know the people it's up to the people to give and they'll have to answer for the lord will provide church will make a way god will make away whatever it might be but i realize this is part of your worship it's important for you to understand these things and if it's if this kind of teaching makes you uncomfortable if you disagree with it i you know there's uh there's certainly a way that we could fellowship more on this subject matter and i would say that you'd be best to honor god and the conviction that you have but you be sure you're humbling yourself to the word of god be sure you're recognizing by revelation what the word teaches but first corinthians chapter 9 verses 13 to 14 says do you not know that they which minister holy things temple what image is he wanting us to think about go back and read in first corinthians 9 find out what he's referring to he says you know that those that minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel there's a lot that's referenced in this first corinthians 9 there's a lot but he's drawing again from the image of those that would minister in the temple those that would offer sacrifices at the altar that they were provided for in the old testament and therefore those that preach the gospel should live of the gospel or be beneficiaries of the gospel that is obeyed that the image paul is looking as this image of a tithe to a levite and how that the people the children of israel gave an offering unto the lord but the lord gave a portion that tenth to the levites to live off of and that was part of all is drawing from that part of the gospel part of our giving as christians is that we would give to those that teach those that communicate those that are faithful in the word of god because they are worthy of this reward and that they that preach the gospel are to ben from your obedience in the gospel and you see just in that these few moments that we're sharing on this that the levites are sharing that the image of the tithe to the levite is expressed in the new testament can you see do you see that hopefully you can see that in just the few scriptures we've we've used today now the next tithe was a tithe that's called for the annual festival and an annual feast but then also feast offerings this is where there is a distinction made and i think maybe you've heard it before a distinction made between what you give is tithing which would be the ten percent that we're all maybe conscious and aware of that you give ten percent uh as tithing to the ministry to the chur to the to the pastor to live off of but then the offering is something completely different complete completely separate from your tithing and so in the old testament there was a tithe for the levite and there's also tithe from the people as an offering and this is a type of the general offerings that are given by believers or by christians to if i can say maintain the church or for the function and service of the church itself not just the living of the ministry or the pastor and in deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 6 there's and i will i'll even admit right now that there is to perhaps a uh oversimplification on my part on the old testament uh these old testament offerings i'm trying to just summarize them instead of getting very detailed there's a lot of other places we could have gone in numbers and a lot of other uh areas that we could have brought it out in but so if you say well brother this seems very over simplistic i'm trying to give more of a general overview instead of drilling down very deeply in each one of these offerings even the types and shadows and what they might represent deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 6 and says this ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your free will offerings and the first things of your herds and of your flocks you read this there's a lot in here that they're giving burnt offerings sacrifices tithes heave offerings vowels free will offerings and the first things of your herds and your flux aren't you glad you weren't a jew then right think of all the things that you had to give do you have your burn offering you have your sacrifice do you have your ties you have your heave offerings you have your vows you have a free offense oh i forgot the first things that i heard we got to go back there's a lot here that's expressed in terms of what an israelite would be giving but this is what god is asking for them to give under the law to his temple and as a as their worship to give and to do is you are to bring your burn offerings your sacrifice your tithes and your heave offerings of your hand your vows and your free will offerings i want you to see in the scripture let's look at deuteronomy chapter 16 verses 16 and 17. three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose now notice this is three times a year in the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of weeks and the feast of tabernacles these are three different times of the year this is a very specific provision in the word of god as we looked in deuteronomy chapter 12 bring your burnt offering sacrifice tithes heave offerings free will offerings first things of your flock this all to be brought and be put into the coffers given to the priests administered in worship uh and taken care of in the uh in the manner in which it was uh they're responsible for it so the three and it says three times in a year you're to do this feast of unleavened bread weeks tabernacles and they shall not appear before the lord empty so don't come to church empty-handed is what they're saying when they'd pass out offerings and and glass jar they would have these or trays and metal trays that was called silent offerings i mean no coin we want paper money and uh i i personally feel that mo a lot of people in this church are trying to i become origami experts because the way that dollar bills are folded it's like a puzzle how do we unfold this and so those who are counting the dollar bills and counting these things uh it takes that much longer when you go through every effort you can to twist and fold tightly that dollar bill or five dollar bill whatever it might be but they don't come empty-handed is what's saying right don't come before the lord empty every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he have given thee this is the old testament expressing this too uh to the worshiper who's coming to the time what's he coming to the church the temple for to worship he's coming to perform his service he's coming to offer to the lord to give thanksgiving and he says when you come for these different feasts don't come empty-handed well what do i need to bring give as you are able according to the blessing which the lord thy god has as a free offering according to each person's measure and the more you could find the more blessed you were he's saying according to the measure of the blessing so the more blessed you are the more you gave there was a there was it was commiserate with it was responsive too i've been blessed i've been blessed i want to give more because god has blessed me this teaching in this is a shadow we can say oh well all these things were done away within the law so then you when you come to the new testament you start all over and you try to build it up again and say well paul says to do this and paul says to do that and it's in the very image of this so then what was this this was the shadow of what paul brings into substance that we as christians we want to give unto the lord as we are able according to the blessing which god hath given us and you'll find that paul uses that exact language this is different from the tithe of numbers 18. can we at least we can recognize that just by reading it right numbers 18 has its place the other places it's referenced in leviticus and different things there's a way that it's established but now he's saying you're going to come in the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks feast of tabernacles when you come don't be empty but give give as you're able so these are contributions that benefit more than just the priest these are contributions that well now here's my tenth to the lord i guess that levite is going to live off of it no these are things that are more than that and it's what we read about in deuteronomy chapter 14. so if you want to look back at deuteronomy chapter 14 we'll read verses 22 to 27. this notice the specific tithe thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field bringeth forth year by year and now it's the seed of the field and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god now who's eating you're gonna bring a tithe but now you're eating in the place which he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn and of thy wine and thy oil and the first things of thy herds and of thy flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the lord thy god always so this is the lesson in doing this tithe bring it to worship partake in it it's going to be to your benefit you're going to use it too and you're going to learn to fear the lord in doing it and at the way be too long for thee to bring corn and wine and oil and firstling so that thou art not able to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there which what is it come on the temple the place of worship the place where god will put his name the place where the sacrifices are the place where god dwell when the lord thy god hath blessed thee says then thou shalt turn it into money and bind up the money in thy hand and shall go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose so now the worshiper the offer is going to bring money and i shall bestow that money and you can see how what that turned into the day of jesus it says money for whatsoever thou soul desires a lust after oxen sheep wine strong drinker whatsoever thy soul desire and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice thou in thy household so what is given is then translated is then used in the service in the worship in the place as a part of your worship and the levite that is within thy gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee so this is a different tithe than the tithing of numbers 18. so it's a tithe if you catch this it's the tithe of the remaining 90 to be used in the worship of the temple so you have ten percent now you have nine percent that's why it's not exactly 30 right you follow me it's a tithing of the 90 that remains this is a free will this is a i i want to come to a free will offering but this is a explicit percentage that god is placing on it but it's in addition to the tithe to the levites for them to live off of and i want you to kind of recognize in its imagery we're not going to spend a lot of time kind of breaking it down because you could spend weeks just parsing through the details on these things that it was in the image of coming to what we would say we could say coming to church we're going to arrive at certain intervals we're going to come we're going to worship when i come i'm going to give something that can be used for the benefit of my household that's going to be used in the benefit of the service and used for those who are participating in it and this is the image of all those coming together to the tabernacle or to the temple to worship now notice this in exodus chapter 30 this is a little bit of a different offering but i'm wanting to use this in this giving a separate giving that's to the function of the worship to the function of the temple and not just relate it to the levites themselves because there's a tie that's what i want you always as a tithe that the levites enjoyed but now there's a giving that's kind of more abroad to the participation of all in worship and exodus chapter 30 verses 11 to 16 and the lord spake unto moses saying when thou take us the sum of the children of israel after their number this is a census tax essentially then the thou shalt then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the lord when thou numbers them that there be no plague among them when thou numbers them now i'm just gonna i want you to be let's just be honest with the text as they do this census every man is going to have to pay a ransom for his soul so he's got to pay something to preserve his soul this they shall give everyone that passeth among them that are numbered half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary as sheckles 20 garas a half shekel shall be the offering of the lord every one that passeth among them that are numbered from 20 years old and above shall give an offering unto the lord this pertained to the males not to women and children and to strangers foreigners prosecutes any they were all included the males 20 years and above shall give an offering to the lord the rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than a half shekel when they give an offer to the lord to make an atonement for your souls now think about this this is uh god god who could preserve the curtains right god who could just put his heads of protection about the temple god who could just supernaturally give provision aaron's rod butted in the presence of the lord and bread is multiplied out by the hands of christ he caught he caused manna to fall out of heavens and quail and parted the red seas god could just preserve right god could just provide god could just anoint the levites they never get hungry they never go to bed the clothes never get dirty right there could have just been a way that god could have done it but somehow in his wisdom he did it so that there wouldn't be such a stark contrast between the those that offered the worship the the priest and the people that there would still be the same in affinity and connection and even offerings priests had to make were sometimes the very same ones for themselves the same ones that had to be offered by other people and it was it's a beautiful uh a program that god has ordained because in one hand he could have just said well i'll just make sure they're always debt-free well how is that going to happen or how i'm just going to make sure they're always provided for well this is how god provided it this is god's program this is his way and he says in that show verse 16 and thou shalt the atonement money of the children of israel it's atonement money for the children of israel and shall appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation that it may be a memorial under the children of israel before the lord to make an atonement for your souls what was in it what was it and to appoint it for the service of the tabernacle the half shekel that was to be paid as an offering unto the lord it's offered unto the lord well it's like well then just put it before the lord and let it stay there but no it's appointed for the service of the tabernacle it was an offering for the building of the tabernacle the repairs of the tabernacle the service in it and for the priests as they would need it it's an offering that is made for the service of the tabernacle and in the offering the giver is telling us that his life is preserved as an atonement for his soul that there would that there would be no plague among them so it's an offering that benefited the giver you recognize that that's what that's what they're alluding to is there as a ransom for his soul that there be no plague among them as a ransom for his soul as a ransom for his soul is atonement for his souls atonement for his soul the image is the benefit that the giver receives but he's also the lord and they'll take that for the benefit of the tabernacle because believe it or not the tabernacle salt it needed garments for the priest you ever think about that there's a lot that went into making sure the tabernacle was working it's an image of these offerings that we see in mark chapter 12 verses 4 it says that jesus sat over against the treasury and behold how the people cast money and the court of describe it uh in some places there was these urns of these deposit trees called treasuries and that people would come to the temple and they would put their donation their money actually into the treasury another established for certain types of casting widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor woman hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury now certainly there's a paradox on the face of it that if she just threw in a farthing or two mites and some are giving a lot more how is it that she's given more and he says for all they did cast of their abundance in of their abundance but she her aunt did cast in all that she had in her punery in her poverty she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living and jesus takes no exception to this his commentary isn't what a waste what a waste they've made this place a den of thieves and this is all going to be destroyed and and very soon anyways and pretty soon the blood is going to be exposed the altar is going to be exposed exposed as bloodless he doesn't have an attitude towards it at all he's saying that this woman has given more than the others he's looking at this worship under the law which is in effect even at this time and he sees the rich come in and give in a lot and this widow comes and just gives in uh two mice which makes a farthing and and says this woman is given more because she's given from her poverty and all of her living he says this but what's actually happening and maybe not a butt but uh in the image that he's describing is this treasury that was set up in the temple received voluntary contributions people are coming to worship and as the worshipers came to the feast there was these receptacles in which they could place voluntary offerings there was actually places where they would place mandatory offerings there were 13 treasuries or these urns and they shaped a certain way in the court of women that received old shekel dues new checkl offerings and different things that needed to be given some of these uh treasuries received offerings that a worshiper legally owed that must give this but then there were others that received voluntary gifts and i found where the numbers changed a little bit as i was reading through the bible so i wasn't quite sure how to nail it down but there were some that they would give of their compelled legally obligated under the law offerings but then there was others that received voluntary gifts as we read a moment ago your free will offerings there's a place for your free will offerings and there was also a place where a man who would appear before and and if you're appearing before the lord he does not come he gives us he is able jesus is most likely referring to this kind of giving where the rich who are very blessed gave as they were able as they were according to the blessing which the lord had given them and the woman that she gave even in her poverty it was these places where these offerings were made and again the offerings are used to buy wood for the sacrifices oil and other necessities and supplies for the proper service in the temple and these are all types of the free will offerings we give as christians to the church for its function i say in the bible there's a specific place for tithing that would go to the ministry and then also in the old testament and then in the old testament there's also a place for this offering free will offerings the in the in the old times it was even a tie that's given that's related to the service to the special meeting to the worship in the temple i want to go to the tithe for the poor and then come back to some new testament scriptures i think that have application a little bit to this tithe for the feast for the tabernacle for the temple it's a tithe for the poor and the old testament these are offerings for the for the needs of the people again i would say that this is in the image of archiving domitians which i would encourage giving to missions an example of our special offerings when we take up for a specific need in the church or certain uh maybe there's a fund that you keep that it's a benevolence fund that you give to those that are needy but this is a type of giving old testament which was a tithe for the poor now if you're doing math these are three we're arriving at three different ten percents there's a map you can say 10 9 and then and then you add on to that to where you could come up with maybe a 27 but if you add it all out over the years as they say well you're going to do this percent one year this percent another year it basically averages up to 23.3 percent every year that an israelite would be giving in their mandatory tithe to the lord this doesn't even include free will offerings so that's not the big reveal that's not the new adjusted number i'm just saying this is what really if you want to get down to it you want to really dig into it and find out what what the tithe was and how much was given this is what an israelite was giving they knew on average 23.3 percent of the year they were giving three 23.3 percent of their increase they were going to be giving back to the lord now they didn't they wouldn't do it thinking oh great they would do it knowing it came with a promise came with the blessing and so then there was on top of that free will offerings that were given now this tithe for the poor we find back in deuteronomy chapter 14 verses 28 and 29 again this is different from the tithe to the levites and this is different from the offerings that we read about in exodus 30 the offerings in deuteronomy 16 chapter 12 from the offerings referenced in that and it's different from what he has just described in verses 22 to 27 the tithe of all their increase that they're going to come and bring into the place where they're going to worship because now it's in a different interval at the end of fear thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thy increase the same year and shall lay it up within thy gates and the levite because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are within thy gate shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest once again this is a tithe or an offering that is separate and apart from the tithe that they would give to the levites it's also different than the increase that they would give in those other years uh that they would participate in and enjoy on the festival and then also different from the free will offerings or even from the because these things are all different but now it's something that's going to benefit others the fatherless the widow the stranger and it comes with the promise again that the lord thy god may bless thee and all the work of thy hand which thou doest that there's a blessing that comes with that that if you're giving and you look at this way now we said there's three different tithes and we do it just in deuteronomy 14 and numbers 18 these three different tithes would uh the 10 percent the 10 percent of 90 the 10 uh then of 81 and you come you arrive at this mathematically you come to what their percentage would be he's saying in all this if you do these things i'm going to bless you that the lord may god may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest and again again it's different from the festival offerings the free will offerings the annual feast offering the levite offerings but this tithe for the poor i want you to recognize just in the verbiage that we've read here it's a given that benefits the needs of other people beyond just the worshiper himself or the temple service or the temple function it's to benefit so that those the fathers the widow those within the gates and the stranger can come and participate and benefit from it and the new testament is very explicit in this that commands this type of giving form for a christian it's a type of giving that paul is emphasizing that's beyond the support to the minister beyond just the support of the church and romans chapter 12 verse 13 it says distributing to the necessity of the saints given to hospitality this is a commandment not just to a pastor someone in an office but this is to all of us he's encouraging the romans to distribute to the necessity of the saints he says in first timothy chapter 6 verse 18 that they do good that they be they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate which is communicate means to share in your increase to to give a portion of your means this is what paul was telling timothy to teach people to do to do good be rich in good works be ready to distribute distribute to the necessity of the saints ready to distribute willing to communicate this is we could say this is mandatory right paul it just when you say mandatory in the light of the new testament in the light of grace that this is it has a different language and a different tenor than it does in the old testament but paul when he's writing these things that fathers uh fathers don't provoke your children to anger that's a commandment that's mandatory that's something the father should say i want to do this husbands love your wives and children honor your father and thy mother and you look at all these commandments this is in the same vein in the same vein that we would wash one another's feet and take communion it's telling us to distribute be ready to communicate in acts chapter 20 verse 35 paul references something that you can't find anywhere else paul said he said it i showed you all things had that so labor and you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive paul said remember i've taught you that in your labor and you're working and your increases you get things support the weak there's more images of this in the old testament and we may not be gleaning and feel we may not be harvesting crops and be able to leave the corners for the stranger and then for the widow and the impoverished but there's a way that paul carries this idea over and says as you labor and as you gain means support the weak the very image of deuteronomy 14 28-29 that there's a giving there's an offering there's a tithe that the weak the fatherless the widow and the stranger would benefit from he says support the weak he says and he draws it back to something that jesus said it is more blessed to give than to receive is to provoke inside of us this christian character if you have the baptism the holy ghost the giver of gifts the giver of life the one who is the giver the offer the lord himself is there's his natures inside of you to unloose this unselfishness and to lose this giving the sacrificing nature and know that you're more blessed in giving than receiving and just as this this poor widow cast in her two mites there was a she was giving but she's blessed in her giving because she's going to receive from the lord the greater blessing and given in galatians 2 10 only they that would only they would that we should remember the poor tell us we should remember before the same which i also was forward to do we ought to remember the poor the the needy support the weak ready to distribute to the necessity of the saints willing to communicate this is the function of the new testament truth right if you if you see it in the scripture you agree you're certainly welcome to say amen i'll take that as a i'll take that as an offering today okay i'll take that as a reward and hebrews chapter 13 verse 16 but to do good again to share your means communicate forgive for with such sacrifices god is well pleased it's telling us that this idea of doing good that they be rich in good works and to do good is probably beyond maybe just living in such a way to we come off as righteous and pious and abstaining but it probably has something to do with overt acts that encourage somebody else recognizes a need fills a gap supports with such sacrifices god is well pleased i would say that this is obviously not mandatory by law but i believe a believer is compelled by grace to do these things within their means as they are able and let me point out too a lot of times we're just thinking in terms of money so someone's in their head saying well okay if i have to do 23.3 percent of my paycheck i've got a budget this is going to crash everything it's going to ruin there goes my dreams of uh owning my own house which i think that ship seems to be selling very quickly here in phoenix anyways but this calculation in terms of money hey that's a part of it right in your giving and that may be what we what we give when we pass the offering plate i haven't seen anybody drop an ipad in there or at least a tenth of one or somebody putting in a handful of corn uh just just origami that maybe you sell at a trade fair i don't know but we're giving money but you realize you can give a lot more than just your money there's people in this church that have resources that could be used by this church there's people that have and i'm again i'm not talking about money there's people in this church have talents and abilities and minds and attitudes that can be a benefit in the church that we can serve there's ways that you can give to where you're distributing the necessity of the saints rich and good works ready to distribute willing to communicate to support the weak to be blessed in giving to communicate and to do good these sacrifices don't always relate to money and there's ways that you can be compelled by grace to give and to serve and to make it as an offering unto the lord and it counts with god as a sacrifice being compelled by grace to do it i remember one time i was aware of a situation that's kind of actually involved a little bit in a situation where a church had a need of something being done at the church and it was an ongoing need a very expensive need there happened to be somebody in the church who that was their profession that's what they did for a living and they actually had they actually worked right next door to the church i thought well you know what i just call the person and see if maybe they would be able to assist the church in this need and i called them up and i said what about this and the answer was no i don't have a burden for that and and it was in that that i realized some people don't even realize what a burden is they think well i'm only going to do it if i not even be able to be happy with myself and i guess i got to give this because i'm so burdened and you just do it to relieve yourself of this anxiety or this pounding headache oh i guess i'm going to have to be nice to somebody today i guess i'm gonna have to help somebody no burdens there's burdens that are by god and there's burdens you pick up we see that in the scripture there's burns in which someone's being bowed down and weighed down there's burdens that are your responsibility and there's other burdens that were asked to bear when you see a burden you see a need in the church and you say oh well i don't have that bird and the lord hasn't put it on my heart maybe he's wanting you to take it and put it there we're all we're looking for the lord to put it on my heart put it on my heart lord i want something to do and he's saying well here it is but what he wanted him to do is maybe super supernatural do something but if it's there's ways that we could take burdens on our heart there's needs that maybe we can fill and some may be more blessed in areas that are more financial and then god wants them to give of their increase there may be others that are able to serve and perform services and do functions to give but let's give let's be givers let's be unselfish i covered it last year through a number of different ways and nobody ever made a comment about it but i was very deliberate through a number of different services to go along the lines of a theme of serving being unselfish giving and making ourselves available you can even go back to where the bride's advocacy is about being servants about serving others now to this and i think these i'm using these in the application of tithing to the poor but it certainly is akin to the believer's free will offerings for the service of the church but the needs of others also paul refers to it in first corinthians chapter 16 verses one and two this is a habit of the new testament church now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye as i have told the churches in galatia to take up an offering upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come in others you gather you make your collection on the first of the week tells us that they gathered the first day of the week this is their custom the new testament they had their gatherings they had church as god had prospered the individual they would give he says do this for the distribution for the saints so that when i come we're not having to pull for offerings and we're not have to take up an offering what is it it's a collection it's people giving their money this would be the giving actually giving of a substance of means for the benefit and use of the saints again i'd say it's a it's akin to the tithe for the poor now do you see that in the least to some degree i would ask before we want you to ponder this i'm not necessarily asking for a verbal response or a q a on this but can you see then in the old testament and i know i've been very simplistic and trying to reference it that there was more let's just say this there was more tithe than just 10 to the priest there's more giving there's more offerings the half shekel the free will offerings the treasury the offering of the festivals the offering at the feast there was certainly a lot more that some would give than just the tithe to the priest and then just by going over it very quickly and trying to fit all this into one service do you see then that paul's using the image of those things and communicating to him that teacheth the ox is worthy of his hire some people say they use that analogy to to just call the preacher an ox or a beast i guess we don't want to muzzle you you're good for you i guess you should eat but there's free will offerings and all the things mentioned in the old testament paul is using the very image of those things a tithe to the poor collection for the saints distributing those that are needy the same burden then the same not in the same sense that the law was mandatory but now in our liberty as christians there's things that we ought to be compelled to do by grace to serve and to give and it exists in the same framework of the tithes of the old testament in question and answers this is in 1961 it's question 161 he's asked the brother brahms to ask the question would it be wrong to use tithes on church building funds is that a good question then it was touching he says no correctly tithes go to the minister so now a very deliberate to answer the question and i think that sometimes we need to pause when there's a question and there's an answer if the question seems maybe a little bit different and we think oh my that's so different think about the fact that he's answering a specific person's question not necessarily yours so he has to answer i believe even the lord would lead him to answer that question in such a way to respond to the need in that person's heart and then it's instructed to us also so we want to kind of catch the thought behind it not just cabbage down on the verbiage but he says no the tithes go to the minister so this person is obviously thinking about maybe the 10 that would be given to the ministry can we use it for just anything for church building funds no it goes to the minister then he points back says in the bible they had a box that they said at the door the old testament when building this box was a fun when people would put in there for the repairing you've seen it many times in the old testament they kept up buildings and things like that all the repairs in the building was taken care of out of that fund but all the tithing went to the priest they're pastors yes tithing's to go for nothing else so brother branham answering this and what has he done he's in between and offerings obviously to the the livelihood of the ministry but then there's also givings that go to the repair of the building to be taken out of that fund and if we drill down in some of the church order you'll find that trustees are responsible for administering the finances of the church to upkeep the building and the things related to the building itself and not the preaching of the word he says i know people take their tithes and give them to a widow woman that's wrong listen this is very important for us to listen to if you've got anything to give the widow woman give her but don't give her god's money that's not yours in the first place that's gods but victor you might remember but brother bernie used to teach on it that when you've given your ten percent by the bernie garcia which i'm just going to confess this publicly i was fashion with the pastor of the day and i accidentally called him brother bernie sanders and i'm never going to be able to live it down and now it's on the internet but brother bernie garcia used to teach that once you've given your 10 percent you still haven't given god anything because that was his that's a good way of thinking about it or you could just look at it it's all god's and it's the first thing he's asking for is 10 back so you still have a responsibility for the 90. he says so when you give that tithe and you give it to the widow one he says that's god's money that's not yours in the first place that's god's so he gives an example so we could really tune into this if you sent me downtown to get a loaf of bread and you give me 25 cents to get bread and i met somebody on the street that wanted something else and i give him 25 cents i give them your money if they ask me for something let them get it over here in this pocket and give them my money but there's 10 of your increase if you want to say your salary your gross your net whatever it is whatever it is in your heart that you believe to be that 10 that you go oh to the lord he says but this he says this is your money and a tenth of it is the lord's whatever pocket he's looking into you got this money over here that's the 25 cents for the loaf of bread that goat is the lord this other one this is your money but a tenth of it is the lord's and the levi the priest could live by the tenth the tenth is to be a tithe and that's to be brought into the storehouse with the promised of god to bless it and a proof he said if you don't believe it come and prove me and see if it won't do it that's right tithings go into the church for the pastor and so forth like that to live on and then the building funds and things like that are a separate fund all together what is brother banh teaching us that there's a difference between the tithe that you owe to the lord and there's and the tithe or the giving that would be to the upkeep of the church the expenses of the pain of rent and utilities and those things he says that's a separate fund all together he references malachi chapter 3 verses 6 to 11. let's read it together if you want to look here i know i know it may be a long maybe lengthy this morning but i was told that uh we're not eating to a particular time anyways they're not gonna go pick up the rest of the food until 12 45 so instead of us all just standing around with our stomachs growling out in the heat well let's just sit let's just sit here for a little bit longer take our time to go over this whatever i don't finish i'm just going to pick up in the meeting and uh and and share some things with you because there's a lot of statements that i have here before me that i don't know if i'm going to get to when brother bram says here the tithes and the tithing belong to the pastor they go to the minister and for nothing else he addresses even whether or not it would be appropriate to take tithes and give it to his ministry he says no you're not to do that he tells us where it's to go to your church to where you're being fed so in malachi chapter 3 verses 6 to 11 for i am the lord i change not therefore you sons of jacob are not consumed even from the days of your father's you're gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i'll return unto you saith the lord of hosts but you said where and shall we return like what do we need to start doing what is it we're not doing will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but you say when have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings there's a plurality here why is there a plurality because there was more than just one tithe to the levites there was other tithes and there's other offerings beyond that you are cursed with the curse why for you've robbed me he says even this whole nation and i i know the construct of it is that maybe you've maybe the whole nation has robbed god but you robbed the nation too the nation is robbed as brother ram said earlier that when the people couldn't give he was robbing the people so you rob god when you don't give but you're robbing yourself you're robbing the church you robbed the nation when you fail to do these things so he says bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that's the treasuries it's the receptacle set up in the tabernacle and the temple there for people to bring their grain offerings to bring their heave offerings to bring their tithe to bring their free will offerings bring them all into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house says improve me now herewith prove me with your offerings prove me with your tithes saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it as we're reading in these other places that the lord thy god may bless thee and all thy work of thy hand which thou doest is he says that thy barns will be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine that there is a there is a if there's an equal response if god has blessed me and i pour out in an offering of giving back to the lord you've increased the measure by which god can bless you again i think it's billy graham that said that we lived much we could make 90 percent go much further and do more for us than the 100 percent of 100 percent that in that giving of the tithe alone and in that sacrifice which god says these are the sacrifices of god that please these are sacrifices that please god that you'll do more with less because god's the force multiplier god's the one that can come in and take something that may seem well i've got little but god can little as much as we sing is when god is in it so i'm barely getting by with using a hundred percent to pay my bills well you there's a there's a there's a there's a need there obviously there's a blessing that you want god to to uh you you want god to come and make that means if 100 is barely making 100 of your outgoing or your liabilities and your your needs you need god to touch you you need god to help you need god to give you some wisdom and insight as to how your affairs are being managed lord get you out of some circumstance you need the blessings of god maybe someone to come along and help you out a little bit you need it and you need to humble yourself and recognize what your christian responsibility of duty is to god not to man or the church but to god and i do not believe that god it would be wrong even as there's statements here in quotes of brother branham that i'm not going to read where i'm saying i've never seen it fail one time and just as we read a moment ago he says and just see prove me god says with a promise to bless it and to proof if you don't believe me come and prove me and see if i won't do it is what he says god is doing so god is being very overt about this saying you know what if you'll do it i'm going to bless you prove me try me so it's one of those places where you say okay well i'm going to do it to prove god and then the next statement i know we've ministered on this at one point as it says there will not be room enough in your uh for you to contain the blessing and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes the consumer what's the devour the thing that whittles away at your resources the thing that whittles the way at your crops that eats away at your fruits i'll rebuke the devourer and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the lord of hosts he will bless your labors exponentially amen i think maybe there's a stigma in a stain on preaching about prosperity or seed offerings and things like that because people have just really stained it there's a lot of rotten nonsense when it relates to it but let's just get all that out of the way and come to the promise i mean there's no ladder house blessing and let's get up here and confess our teslas and everything else and you know this little this this obscure uh cryptocurrency i'm all in on you know that the price is just going to go up a thousand times no let's just forget all that and let's just again take the advice that we've heard over the last few services from the message of our live for god live humbly work labor plant your potatoes harvest your potatoes plant your wheat harvest your wheat and give unto the lord this isn't a we're not trying to fleece god to win the lottery but these are things that we do and he says i will bless you anybody here want to throw up a hand and say you've lived it you've experienced it when you've honored god he's blessed you i could testify that god has done that for me time and time and time again i'm going to keep going god being misunderstood brother brahms asked the question in this service can a christian go to heaven if he or she does not pay tithe you want to know the answer to this oh it's right there you see it he goes i could not say yes or no to that but i do believe that every christian is obligated to pay tithings because it is a commandment of the lord and blessed are they that do all his commandments that they might be have a right to enter into life the tree of life quoting them from revelation now i do believe that the tithe that tithe payon is essential to a christian experience he says a christian is obligated to pay tithings because i do believe that tithe pain is essential to a christian experience i can say this and i've often thought about it because um i'm receiving the tithes here and making taking meticulous records of it i see the faithfulness of some people and i and and i know the needs in their hearts and what they desire in life and they're so faithful to do it and i can't tell you enough just how much that giving resonates to god that there's a there's a deliberate i've even noticed that with certain people that they have one job and then they have other jobs and you always know they've picked up something extra because they don't waste any time it's almost as if they got paid by paypal they immediately turn around and pay tithes by paypal say oh they must have just model on it two o'clock in the afternoon because they're so quick to give they're so faithful in those things and it's it's essential to the christian experience it's part of this obligation and i see people doing it and i see they're honoring god and doing it and i know that god doesn't miss it it's essential to the christian experience and i would like to add that as he says this tithe and tithe and i'm not trying to change what he's saying but as the old testament called all of those gifts tithes i would say it's also essential to give offerings essential to give to missions oh well how much how much this is free will this is voluntary this is what's in your heart to give this is according to each man's measure is what god has blessed you in second corinthians chapter nine verses five to nine again there's much more in some of these passages uh and i found that the way that paul writes it sometimes um it's not as apparent it's maybe used in a different language than maybe we would like but and you'll notice he says therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty what was their bounty to collect their offerings collect their giving he calls it bounty where have you had noticed before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness so this bounty is a free will offering it's a gift it's giving it says but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully paul not trying to impose by guilt or condemnation or by covetousness or use any other metric or try law to get people to give he says we're going to collect you're going to give it's in your duty i would say as a christian to give but he says this is your metric by which you can measure your giving if you're going to give a little you'll get a little but if you give a lot you'll reap a lot this is just what the new testament is saying when it says bounty making up your bounty is a matter of giving as a matter of giving he's directly referring not necessarily our spiritual works of prayer and reading our bible and praying and laying hands on the sick and those things but he's literally talking about giving and he says he that sows sparingly will reap sparingly but he that sows bountifully shall reap bountifully and then what's the measure by which i want to give every man according as he has purposed in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god love with the cheerful giver this is what i would say would instruct all of us in terms of our offerings our building fund donations our giving to some have given specific offerings to us moving into here as there's been a lot of different needs associated with it and the things that you see even the fact that we got went out and got these monitors that are here in the sanctuary one that's going to be going in the fellowship hall one in the nursery these were all given free will someone gave it the church church didn't spend the money to do it it wasn't even an offering someone just went out and bought them and provided them what they do they did that within their means and trusting no one's going into debt to do these things but they did it within their means is they'd purposed in their heart and they didn't do it grudgingly well i guess if i'm gonna have a deep decent screen to see the words on i better go buy a decent size it's not having to mess with the keystone on that projector and it's so loud and it took up five different seats and you know it was uh not of even of necessity well i guess i better have to do this but a cheerful giver this is the standard by which we measure our giving as christians knowing that if i sow i'll reap if i sow a lot i'll reap a lot if i sow a little i'll reap a little and then i'd do it as i purpose in my heart my conviction as the spirit of god would lead me that's that way if i could say this to all of us here if for some reason you know how much somebody else has given don't ever belittle it don't ever despise it don't compare don't judge well this person over here only gives 50 bucks i get 52. don't ever compare don't ever brag don't ever look at what you think you can give in someone else because every man has to do it as he purposes in his heart to give and he says god loves a cheerful giver verse 8 is extraordinary and god is able to make all grace abound towards you directly as a response to your given he's able to make all grace abound you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work this is what god is able to do remember this as you give remember god loves a cheerful giver gives you purpose in your heart but remember if you so little get a little and he says so god is able to make all grace abound your that you will always have sufficiency in all things and abound to every good work you say remember this as you give let this be what's in your heart as you give that god is able to make his grace abound towards you that you'd have sufficiency in all things i would i would say that there's probably some people that could pause right now and stop and look back in their lives and say oh maybe i wasn't as smart in business as i thought it was maybe i didn't just time the market right maybe i didn't maybe this didn't happen because i was sharp and look back and say you know what i've always honored the lord by worshiping him in my giving to whatever i was able to do there's situations where some people can't give because of certain circumstances but they give what they can and you can look back in your life and find you always did what you could in your means from a heart from a cheerful heart and god always said i'll bless you i'll make up the difference i'll bless your endeavors i'll bless what you're trying to do you give you've given you've given you've given i've looked out after you and you're not deserving of a seed in the shark tank or in a fortune to run a fortune 500 company you've just always honored the lord with your giving and he's honored you he says in verse 9 as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remained forever this is what god is able to do to disperse abroad to even to you to allow it to arrive to you god is able to for his grace to abound you and have sufficiency in all things paul relating it specifically to our new testament christian giving jesus says it this way in luke chapter 6 verse 38 give and it shall be given unto you as paul related it that christ said it is blessed more blessed to give than to receive give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over it's an illusion to the offerings in the old testament and how there was this offering that was made and when you wanted to get it right you'd press it down right you're gonna have somebody i don't know how this works so correct me later but when you're someone's gonna be making you espresso don't they grind it and then press it and don't you want to make sure they get it all in there you know just a little dainty little dollop in there just to let you know you want it okay you want to be strong it's pressed down and when they pour it when you say no foam why because you want it to the top don't cheat me you pressed it down you want it to press down and you want it and when they pour it get it to the top no foam get it on top i want all of it he says this is what god will do give and will be given to you good measure press down shake now and run it shall men give into your bosom for the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again this is a principle applicable in a lot of different areas whether it be your attitude towards others your lack of grace and patience to somebody your whatever judgment you meet out you'll be met with but now whatever measure you are giving whatever worship you give whatever praise you give to god whatever lifting up whatever heaving and exalting and worship and praise there's an equal blessing reciprocal to what you're giving and give and it shall be given to you and god with good measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall god even give into your bosom and you'll receive it at others from others as you distribute to their necessities and look out after them in their need i'm working to a close here but just give me some feedback is this helpful this morning has it been also helpful this afternoon because it it is 12 15. rounding up a bit just two more statements i'd like to read with you but we're closing with this one of them i didn't even provide because i just didn't know where we'd be here at the end but i've got i've got uh three more pages here in front of me if you're if you're up to it redemption by judgment at the very end of the sermon brother graham's praying they're taking up an offering get ready to take up an offering and this is how he prays he says our kind heavenly father thou has taught us in the word that let every man lay aside that god has prospered him that when the first day of the week when we come together that we should bring in our tithe and offerings into the place your house it's it's kind of a seems to be alluding to first corinthians 16 but this is what he's saying we're taught and we see this in the word and he says and we thank thee for the privilege that we have of worship thee in this manner which is such a little way doesn't it seem small maybe the the baskets that we pass out doesn't it seem small have we ever thought maybe it interrupts the flow of the song service right song leaders sometimes you just want to worship and you got to remember take up the offering take the take up the prayer request and let the sunday school in and you just all these different formalities but maybe we could kind of just change our whole approach to it and realize worship hasn't even hiccuped when they come forward with the baskets to take up an offering it may seem so small and it may seem disconcordant with lifting hands and praising but then people digging into their wallets and their purses and people shuffling around and i we know how it is those of us who bore the baskets how awkward you might feel when you're kind of standing there you know like who wants it where do i go and sometimes you walk the whole length you go 90 feet and don't have anything in it we've had services where nobody gave anything but we gave an opportunity and we know that this may seem a little bit awkward and it may seem not like what the worship we think it should be praised it should be instruments it should be clapping of hands and and some of us may really really love the music but if you love worship you'll give because as you look at this let every man lay aside which he's prospered him and when the first day of the week this sunday we come together we should bring our tithe and offerings into this place he says and we thank you for the privilege we have to worship thee in this manner which is such a little way it's small but it's a privilege to be able to worship him with giving maybe you would you would better appreciate this if you never had anything to give and maybe some of us have been in that place where we didn't have anything to give he said but we thank thee for it father and with grateful hearts we come to thee this morning bless all those who do give that have to give that has to give from and bless those who do not have of these natural substances to give from we pray that you'll give them many and much more than natural substance as your steward help us to watch over it and it's a much of the natural substance as your steward help us to watch over it in the right way that will be spent for the right thing this we ask in christ's name thy son amen amen that beautiful that's the attitude towards it it's not a formality it's not tradition it's not collecting attacks when the bill comes due one of the dad jokes i tell is when the server comes and says would you like the check i say no and so it's not like the checks coming due and you've got to pay this but lotus it's worship we thank you for the privilege we have to worship you in this manner such a little way when you write out your check if you're doing it digitally that's fine and i'm not encouraging everyone to necessarily do that there's a lot of talk and some of the some of the chat groups and a lot of the data that's being flooded around there that we've been able to exponentially increase our giving by going totally over to paypal well that's wonderful but what i want is our worship to be exponential and i don't have any issue with people using those manners those means to give it's very convenient uh if you just want convenience i'll just set it up by bluetooth or nfc that as soon as you walk in that door we take 23.3 percent if you want efficiency like gratuity is added to a party of eight or more all right we could do something like that but it's more your free will in your heart as you are able as the lord has prospered you don't ever feel ashamed that there's a special offering and in your heart you can't give you're not able to give don't ever feel ashamed in that don't ever lift yourself up above somebody else whenever there's an offering and you're able to give a lot just always thank god and as brother branham prayed bless those that have some to give from and bless those who don't have it and may you give them natural substance that they can give from why not so that we could pay off a church building or we could go out and do this and i remember one time a brother had a built a new church as a really nice church they had a kind of a smaller church and able to build a new church and there's a really nice church and he said from the pulpit i'm not going to stop until the pulpit is gold real nice that's not the attitude that's not the goal it's one of the things i love about this building there's no pretense it's it's that little room not the cathedral and i'm grateful for it but the opportunity to give it's a privilege that we have to worship in such a little way that's the opportunity being presented to you as you have means and can give and to do it faithfully to do it consistently because the giving of tithes and offerings is part of your worship to god amen and there's a lot of scriptures we could use to bring into this area right here but this this worship survives the abolishment of the law it survives the disbanding of the levitical priesthood and the abolishment of the sacrifices this worship continues the worship in your giving has survived the law the worship continues this worship of giving of distributing to the needs of the saints the collection on the first day of the week all these different things and the shadow that the law held that's now fulfilled in the body of christ through our free will offerings and through our tithing and our giving that worship still continues after the fulfillment of the law by christ that's still alive today because god says prove me what what a declaration prove me i promise if you give i promise if you pay i'll multiply your substance and broadband said that's a challenge for anybody every christian that goes for this question and every other question he's referring to this question this other question every christian should pay tithes that's right it should be done and he says it's a challenge to anybody and he's taking it straight from malachi 3. musicians if you could make ready to come in the pergamy and age i'm just going to close with this statement that everyone says and we do have in our there's my alarm i got to stop and we do have in our protestant churches soup suppers entertainments skating oh my rag cells and everything else now you know that's the truth well now if that is god's word friends it's the truth and all protestant churches are guilty never was god's plan to have soup suppers and dances in the basements and all their carrying on to pay off the pastor and things if people were just taught to pay their tithes that would be all there would be to it that's god's plan god has a plan but man monster wants to make his own plan hybriding god's plan if that was just taught that'd be all there would be to it so we've taken a couple hours today to teach it knowing that god has made a promise that if you do it that's all you need
