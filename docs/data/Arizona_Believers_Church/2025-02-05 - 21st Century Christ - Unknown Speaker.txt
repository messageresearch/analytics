TRANSCRIPT
========================================
1 Peter chapter 1 and we're I maybe for time sake we'll just start with verse three and we know that Peter is addressing the elect of God and he says Blessed Be verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead so born again quickened and there's this living expectation to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time where wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ again there's this looking forward to this expectation whom having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into now there's a lot lot there it's actually a very lengthy uh uh sentence and or scripture there these are things passed and present for him now he begins to look forward and he says wherefore gir up the loin of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be you holy for I am Holy amen praise the Lord you can take your seats the title of my sermon this evening is 21st century Christ and uh it's I think even maybe just in thinking about it now myself it may be just somewhat self-explanatory but 21st century Christ and before we get going I will say that my my train of thought tonight will be may seem very singular uh if not just very simple but there are several layers or themes that kind of track or be layered on top of each other that are running through these many different scriptures that we're going to be looking at so uh there may be something that comes up in one scripture and kind of hold on to that because as we go into the next scripture you might find that even though the emphasis seems to be something else this just builds right into it and so there's a lot of things that connect together and there's a lot of ways that we could amplify it and just uh broaden the scope of the sermon even the length of it but we don't want to do that so I just encourage you to concentrate and ask God to make some of these connections and give you understanding as we go forward because there's just a lot of things that connect together even though it may seem very uh singular and very simple but keep this in mind that we're preaching tonight on a 21st century Christ the century we're living in now a Christ of today now if you'll turn to Titus chap 2: 11 and 12 like to start with this scripture and it was where we were last Wednesday it says for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world if I could put it this way the revelation of Jesus Christ teaches us how to live in the world that we exist within it's not going to tell us how to live in a day gone by it's not necessar going to tell us how to live in the Future IT addresses Us in the present tense as Peter's the one that says that you should be established in the present truth not a historical God and the laws of the Old Testament and the ways of the children of Israel in The Exodus or in the temple but rather the present truth and so he uh Titus is saying that or Paul writing to Titus says that this Revelation that comes will teach us to live in the world that we exist within and as we read in 1 Peter chapter 1 I'd like to read verses 5 and 13 and we know that these scriptures speak to an end time prophecy it's the time that we're living in now to those who have been begotten again into a lively hope those who are the elect of God who have been Born Again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost are kept by the power of God through faith so it's that grace through faith that we heard about on Sunday unto salvation now this isn't uh the salvation of the Soul because we are already quickened there's this Deliverance of finality ready to be revealed in the last time so I'm using these scriptures just to kind of Orient all of us to the fact that we're living in an age when there is an end time salvation that has been revealed and you could look into do the word of God and see there's different layers to that especially in a Third Exodus but there's a Salvation to be revealed and Peter revisits this theme of a faith uh this being kept unto a Salvation to be revealed in the last time and he says it this way in verse 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope now again as as Paul wrote it to Titus he said there's a Grace that brings Salvation And it teaches us to live so soberly righteously and godly Peter is saying that we should uh G up the loins of our mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ brings a specific dispensation of of Salvation a Rapture a body change all those things that we could use to describe the season that we're in now and how I'd like to say it this way just to summarize I feel like I'm just kind of pointing to a subject that's very fast and say that Jesus Christ is unfolding himself to us today we believe that I believe that I trust that you do too and that a Grace has been brought to us there's a Salvation that is unfolding we're feeding on the word of God and it's going to lead us to our unseen bridegroom so there's this season this time and this dispensation where Jesus Christ has is being revealed there's this Capstone um Revelation that's coming in this end time and those are themes from Christ as a mystery H and those different things so if we look at it what Paul is writing and even what Peter is writing Grace teaches us says that for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us well if there's a Grace that has been brought to us at the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour if there's been a headstone that's been introduced with that double Grace Grace Grace then it's the same Grace in the end that's teaching and what it does is it teaches us how to live in our present world as it says teaching us how to live in this present world that's the 21st century I don't know if people fantasize here about days gone by and what century they'd want to live in uh I found one of the most extraordinary things in fatherhood is the type types of questions you get asked on a daily basis that relate to things you would have never thought of uh in terms of what your favorite is and if you could live in any particular decade or whatever it might be or asked a lot of questions and it's it's fun fod to talk about but we live now in the 21st century we know that we've entered a new year it's 2025 and the best way to make this timelist is we can say you live in the now you can't live in yesterday and you can't live in the future though there's some people we know who appear to be living in the future with all the things they get to enjoy and do and the technology have but we live in a present tense and this is one of those things that you could put off to the side and say this is a this is a paradigm that you can view everything I'm saying in uh tonight in terms of a theme but we live in the present tense and there's a past and there's a future and there's ways that these things work together where we can't just completely Deni the past because in the past is a great cloud of witnesses that compel us to go forward there's things that we should learn from in our past there's things in our past that have been Stakes driven down there's a great Foundation a and and yet there's a we can't just disregard the future because there's decisions you're making right now that are going to impact your future so we are forward-looking but we live in the present tense and there is a Grace that's been brought to us a Grace that has been extended there's this incredible dispensation of the word of God which is characterized by this grace and and so many beautiful themes in the scripture but this Grace does not exempt us from living as Titus it says in Titus soberly righteously and godly in this world cannot view the work of God in our lives as there is a Salvation of the Soul we just want to hang on till we get out of here and then once we get into that other realm when the devil's Bound by a chain of circumstance or once hell and every all sin is cast in Lake of Fire then we'll be able to kind of live above the things of the world we need to learn now how to live soberly righteously and godly in this world and so what Grace does is it shows us how to deny ungodliness shows us how to deny or say no to worldly lust so that we can be in the world but at the same time be distinct from it and again there's we are aliens we're pilgrims we're strangers but we're all clearly human we're just we're that and it's that it's that Humanity that makes us truly such a wonderful display of the gospel because if we were just literally aliens from another realm and another planet everybody just be all of us right they just be like well what do you eat and how do you do this and how do you do that how did you get here and though there'd be this identity that yeah you're completely foreign but what is it that makes the Christian so extraordinary and so Supernatural is they appear the same as everyone else and so there is this challenge to where we have to learn how to live soberly righteously and godly in this world and in order to do that we have to deny or say no to ungodliness we have to reject worldly lust so that we can still exist within the world and be distinct from it now I I hope this doesn't seem to be too much of a Interruption here but much attention and I I think even last year we we labored on this particular thought a lot but there's much attention that's given to the works of Christ when I say the works of Christ specific instances in which the Supernatural is performed whether it be the deaf here or the dumb speaking and so there's a lot of uh knowledge of an emphasis on uh The Works of Christ and the gospels and then subsequently there's a lot of emphasis on the Acts of the Apostles in the book of Acts and we know and are rightly taught that when the if the tree ever puts forth another Branch it'll write another book of Acts because those are the acts of the holy spirit that Christ to was in those gospels and Performing things he gave this promise to the church the same works that I do shall you do also so there are these works that we are to do by the life and the nature of the holy spirit that works within the believer and the church and there should be no effort whatsoever exerted to diminish these Deeds there should should be no effort to uh diminish them or qualify them or reduce them down to something else or undermine their Supernatural origin they are the works of Christ they are Supernatural they're the acts of the Holy Spirit and we shouldn't comb through the gospels of the book of Acts say well they didn't really do this and Peter getting out of the jail there's a simple explanation and all these and there should be no trifling with it there should be no diminishing in it and certainly I would not uh reduce my expectations to say that God couldn't do the same thing today I would believe for all those things I would believe for miracles I would believe for Supernatural things to the point to where I would believe that if I was in a situation that seemed impossible to get out of God could just make a way and Oh I thought this happened we thought that happened God is able to do the same things today and and and we should never we should never uh diminish those things and and I'm not going to say but and start to diminish it what I will say is consideration should be given in all those things to the nature and character of God who's performing those things what his purposes were and what his intent was as you go through the gospels and as you go to the book of Acts you'll find that in performing these Miracles and doing these things often times Jesus would relate it to some point or something that was being expressed and there's this Awakening to the Supernatural and there is uh God has a pattern of giving a sign and catching people's attention through the Supernatural and it's not so that they could then hunger for the bread that has been created out of nothing or that they could desire to see the Miracles but they could truly hear his voice and believe for the promise of that hour that all the signs and wonders and miracles were trying to get our attention to see so there are certain purposes and intent whenever God moves whenever God does something there's times when people will witness and experience the supernatural and they'll see it happen in a church service and they'll testify oh I saw this happen I saw that happen and this is very specific thing was done or the pillar Fire w was over the pulpit and these things happen and I would never doubt that if I was you people say that happens and as a and when that when anyone's ever shared that with me I said that that should get your attention that God's mindful of you that if anything is Vindicated it's not the one on the platform whom they s thought they saw the pillar fire over but rather God was trying to show you he's mindful of you he's speaking to you he has you in mind and there's some connection that you begin to make to the word not like ooh there's a sign that guy must be a good preacher there's an intent and a purpose that God is trying to achieve as we are using the subject of art this year on at least through this beginning of the year uh to look at different themes in the Bible uh pay attention because this is going to sound like I don't know what I'm talking about but there's a difference between a work of art and the work of art see what I did there that there's a difference between that which is produced which would be a work of art and that which is the process or skill of creating art and there is if I could put it this way just to maybe not get bogged down here as anyone can admire a painting and and read a book or listen to a composition and and and that's something that anyone could do I was thinking of it this way that you know anyone can eat but not anyone could cook and so chef gustau sent me a text message and said a contr that anyone can cook and well I just might take the side of the food critic Anton ego that it's not that anyone could cook or that anyone can be a great artist but that a great artist can come from anywhere should I quote brother Remy too at the same time and that's to me I think just to maybe we're getting all on the same page here is quote Ratatouille but there's this thought that there's certain things that anyone can enjoy in that we can all enjoy on some common level reading listening I can appreciate this I can view this I can eat but I can't cook or or there's this uh uh things that are produced that we can all enjoy but can we all produce the same thing can we all bring the same thing forth and so anyone could admire a painting read a book or listen to a composition but there's a difference in knowing the mind of the artist there's a difference in understanding the motive and and perceiving the intent or or being even inspired there's many things that we could all look at and be like that is beautiful there's things we could read and say that was really good there's things that we could listen to and say man I I love that the combination of movements and those different things this is but there's a level too where you begin to connect with something and it actually inspires you I think that should warn us too of how there's different influences and things in the world that can cause you to be moved and inspired and it's coming from a very dark place but there can be a work of art the thing that is created or produced the thing that is seen or enjoyed but then there's also the work of art which is the process or skill that is the creating the the creation and the Creator behind that and as we want to as I'm wanting to look at that idea or that the process and not just the product and the works of Christ and the Acts of the Apostles that we could we could delineate and say these things are Supernatural but what is God's purpose what is his intent what is it that's being expressed if these are the things that he does maybe I'll even go back to the beginning of last year that what what do these things tell us about what God values what does this telling us about the nature and character of God now I want to use these scriptures several of them in just one scenario really to make this point or one particular theme through several different places but in Hebrews chapter 3 I'm going to be reading uh and if you could turn there in your Bibles anybody who brought their Bibles just turn there so you could see this I want to read in Hebrews chapter 7 and I want to read verses and I want to so I will I will be reading from verse 7 to verse 14 and I'm going to read it in a unique way I'm going to take what he begins to say in verse 7 and then leave out the parenthetical phrase or those things that are in the parenthesis in the preceding verses and pick it back up where he again later after the parenthesis did I see Hebrews chapter 7 see I just seen if you guys are pay attention what I meant was Hebrews chapter 3 verse 7 3 * 7 and so verse seven is where I'm going to begin and I'm just going to use the wherefore and then I'm going to jump down to the beginning of verse 12 so I'm just going to read this part together wherefore take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end I find that these themes that Paul is uh sharing in this book of Hebrews are very weighty very heavy a lot of things I find myself really chewing on that take heed lest there be an evil heart of unbelief and that would cause us to uh lose uh uh you know that we we can lose if we don't hold fast our confidence into the end so there's a lot there that gets our attention and Paul is very clearly warning of apostasy or which means that Falling Away From the Living God and this is distinct from these dead idols and things that have no life it's a reality from this reality of God and he says to exhort and encourage one another to Divine things to the nature and character of Christ that there should be this uh encouragement while it is day do it daily while it is today the present tense do it presently the now this day of life where you're living because as we all know tomorrow is the devil's day it's it's when we we put off everything till tomorrow and let it happen tomorrow wait till tomorrow well there is a a there's a way of saying that we never actually will live tomorrow you can only live today it may seem to be a clever play on words but the reality is that there uh that the only way that you can truly be living is if it's in the present tense and there is a exhorting one another daily while it is called today today it means the right now the the day of life and if I could say it this way I want you to begin to recognize how Paul is using this the way he's using is I think it's just a a very incredible way that he just lays it all out but there's a learning from yesterday in order to live today and this is what he's going to do he's going to use an example from yesterday in order to learn how to live today so that we can enter into a forever or that we could determine our condition in forever so Paul is going to draw from the past he's saying wherefore take heed and when I say wherefore there's this insert and then he picks it back up take heed Brethren uh that you exhort one another daily while it is today and now he points he's pointing to the past so let's start over again with verse 7 H as the Holy Ghost saith now this is Paul's example he's using to make his point about what we should be doing daily as the Holy Ghost say today if you will hear his voice hear his voice in the now hear his voice today not a glare of another age not a a promise of tomorrow but his voice today Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me now Paul says as the Holy Ghost saith so there's some inspiration that the Holy Ghost has given previously and he says in the wilderness so that orients the Hebrew to the past and to The Exodus your fathers tempted me those are their forefathers those are the tribe tribes in the past proved me and saw my works for 40 years so these saw his Works wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always he in their heart and they have not known my way so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest Paul is saying to them in the present at that day that they should exhort one another daily while it is today lest something happen in the future and he uses the past as his example that he wants to draw from and so there is this example in The Exodus where they Harden their hearts and God said because of you not listening to my voice today I'm going to make a decision about your future and what he is drawing from here you'll find I just I just love how uh just multifaceted this becomes I don't know if this is meta or how how we might describe it but then he's actually quoting from Psalms 97 excuse me Psalms 95 I can't get my numbers right but at least they're threes fives and sevens Glory Psalms 95: 7-1 he says for he is our good God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice now notice how familiar this is and what Paul has quoted in Hebrews chapter 3: 7 to 11 he has quoted from this Psalm 95 today if you'll hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness it's almost word for word when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work Paul kind of amplifies it saw my my works for 40 years they seen him do things and deeds and wonders and signs and miracles today hear my voice unless except unless your heart so that your heart is not hardened as your fathers were when they saw my Works verse 10 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do error in their heart and they have not known my ways unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest so what's happening in Psalms 95 as I read it is David is using the Exodus which for David at that time is the yesterday to admonish and exhort Israel in their today warning them of what their future will be if they don't listen in the now so David in Psalm 95 is telling the Israel today hear his voice and don't Harden your heart like they did yesterday and when they hardened their heart in the yesterday it impacted their future so today I'm using the past to teach you so that you can not make the same mistake and impact your future and then Paul does the same thing and now in his today he quotes the David of yesterday who was quoting the further yesterday to exhort the church and the bride in that day that they ought to not Harden their hearts and listen to the voice of that day so that it doesn't determine something bad in their future and it's in that now exhort one another daily in the now in numbers 14 I just want to read this 1 verse 1411 of what this day looked like and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be air they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them signs are even Miracles and proofs that's why I was proven I it's in the sense of appearing I've appeared among them I've done signs and wonders they they how long is it going to be before they just believe me and take me at my word and so they the the pattern we see is that there's works that are done in a manifestation and appearing of God in that moment or in the now but yet while it's happening there's not something being reciprocated and being seen on the other end so there's a hardening of the heart and it it changes their direction or their destination and the example that Paul uses the example that David has used is this provocation in the wilderness when God was performing sign and wonders but yet it was never provoking this deeper faith and notice what the Bible says they all enjoyed and what they partook in in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 veres 1 to6 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized under Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink and now he implies he gives us clarification for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed him and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness their bodies were scattered throughout the Wilderness they died in the wilderness as he's writing to the Corinthians Paul is revisiting this very similar scene of how long will it be a they believe me with all the signs that I've showed him as David said for 40 years I've been grieved and I showed them these wonderful works but they hardened their hearts and so I was provoked to anger and God was not well pleased it says in verse 5 for they were overthrown in the wilderness so he says in verse six now these things were our examples give you some nighttime reading continue to read here after verse 6 because he begins to give these other descriptions but he says to the intent that we should not lust after evil things is they also lusted and then he says that we ought not to do this as they did we ought not to do this as they did and he begins to give all these examples of what they did in the Exodus while there was a Vindicated Prophet that had a message signs and wonders followed it and great many Works were being done in their midst but yet they never did fulfill the promise of the message they never did fully Embrace or catch what God was doing because they perish in the wilderness so he says they are an example to us the yesterday is an example to us that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted I believe Grace has come in this hour and taught us to say no to worldly lust to reject and deny ungodliness so that we can live soberly and righteously in this present world now we could ask this question so that it just moves us a step further in this sermon but how were they how did they die short of their goals they were overthrown in the wilderness the phrasing suggest bodies just scattered through the dust in the desert what caused them to behave as they did to lust after evil things to not enter into their rest and to provoke God look at Hebrews chap 3:1 it says wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always Heir in their heart so the heir is in their heart and they have not known my ways I want you to catch that they AED in their heart and they have not known my ways Psalm 95: 9 and 10 when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my work so they had seen his work 40 years long was I griev with this generation said it is a people that do Heir in their heart and they have not known my ways now if I could say it this way they saw his work but didn't know his way they have not known my ways they have seen the Miracles they've seen the work they've seen the product they've seen the work of art but they have no ideas to the process they they see what I can do but through all of it they never get past the surface they're only immediately enjoying the fruits of it they just like what strikes the eye they can they can eat the meal but they wouldn't know how to cook it if I asked them to they did not see past the acts and deeds to see the revelation of God well they knew there was a god you couldn't deny that but they get they didn't get a revelation of his his nature his character his personality however you want to say his motive and what he was trying to do like why is it that he's doing this and I say even in this hour this time that we're living in God has appeared to us he's manifested himself in many Supernatural ways we can say that that's one of the most distinct outstanding things in brother Brown's Ministry is God is declaring to us the supernatural there's this sign of sermon that's given there's signs and wonders of Miracles that are performed and there's witness and witness after witness of the supernatural that was done in his ministry but we cannot make the same mistake of the yesterdays and bring the evil upon us in the future in Hebrews 3 and Psalms 95 and even numbers 14 1 Corinthians 10 there's this recitation and this pointing to the fact that the children of Israel saw what he did but still didn't know his ways in Psalms 103:7 it says it this way I think this is a very beautiful scripture to see that God will show his ways and and there's a difference with the acts he made his ways he excuse me he made known his ways unto Moses his acts un to the children of Israel was reading the scripture this week and this is the reason why I use ways for all my navigation says take heed to your ways and don't use Apple Maps Google Maps that's what I use I got a scripture for it he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel it might seem as if they're both the same thing and just talking about two different groups of people or an individual and a group of people but he made known his acts unto the children of Israel that means it speaks of a wanness but it's also a deed or a doing in the sense of something being affected comes from even the Hebrew word to act severely and to to deal with severely and so they could see God's act they could see his works his plagues on the enemies they could see his Redemption out of bondage leading them through the Red Sea feeding them with man in the wilderness bringing them to the land of Canaan those are undeniable facts they saw the acts that he performed his affecting God would affect something they could see that moving they could see that visibly in Psalm 78: 1-22 you're like whoo that's a long way it is let's just read through it give ear oh my people start Psalm 78 I think it's just a good good to read through we'll be done here in just a moment give ear oh my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from we will not hide them from their children showing to the generation to come the Praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he ha done these are the works that we would see these are the ones that he shows the things that he manifests for he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children oh so importance of teaching these things and reciting these things that the generation to come might know them even the children of which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children this is what we're going to do today we're going to tell you of the yesterday and we're going to tell you now so in the future you could tell them of the yesterday and teach your children and their and your today so that they can do the same in the future this is the way that it that is to be done in verse 7 that they might set their hope in God now what was the purpose of reciting all the Miracles the signs and words this great strength and these wonderful works that he had done in Israel that they might set their hope in God something's missing if it's merely a a lesson of History something's missing if it's just telling wonderful stories to go to bed they had to set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his Commandments the very purpose behind sharing these things was to understand something about God what he required and what was pleasing to him it might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart right and whose Spirit was not steadfast with god notice that alignment these things the stories they actually are going to tell are the works that God did with their fathers think this is remarkable maybe I'm just thinking about it this is Fresh So if I make a mistake just forgive me but the the the way that it's being said is these are the things that God did to your fathers we're going to tell you the wonderful works that God did so that you hearing that can hope in your God and Obey him even though your fathers didn't when they actually experienced them that's something God does not give Hope on the uh with the Next Generation he do even have to repeat the same cycle he just wants you to take him at his word that this is what he did even if the generation he's manifested to reject him listen God used brother Brandon's Ministry around the world displaying the Supernatural and he was rejected we could say oh no he was popular he was wonderful everybody love no not everybody loved him but the message was rejected and we will not see his ministry with the uh with these eyes we do not get get to experience the same way and we can see that he was rejected in that generation but we contined to share the Vindication we continue to share the testimonies of the powerful example and we continue to go through the message of the hour that we might have hope in God even if that generation is the one that rejected him thank you Lord and it says that they were rebellious and they didn't set their heart right as it said in those other scriptures their they aired in their heart so they always a in their heart and what is it they have not known my ways they have not known my ways and here it says their Spirit was not steadfast with God through everything God did there was never a moment where it pulled them into rhythm with them they never syned up there there was never this connection it's like okay now we're in the flow now we're getting things done the children of Ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle was reading that about the use of Ephraim and I guess it's widely accepted that ephra is being used as an example of all of Israel but notice their what they did even though they're armed carrying bows they turned their back in the day of battle they kept not the Covenant of God and refused to walk in his law and forget his works and his Wonders that he had showed them they had been done they saw him they experienced them marvelous things did he in the side of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the field of zoen he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as a heap in the daytime also he led them with the cloud and all the night with the light of fire he clav the rocks in the wilderness gave them drink as out of the great depths he brought streams also out of the Rock and caused Waters to run down like rivers and they sinned yet more against them by provoking the most high in the wilderness there is I think I'm just going to read to verse 22 but you could keep reading keep reading keep reading keep reading of all the things it begins to say that it did to where even when God bring begins to bring certain things they're like oh well can God just spread a banquet right out Never Satisfied they just want him to keep doing the Wonders and doing the Wonders and it's as if that there was never they were never uh sad they were never satisfied but in a really nasty sense that they just wanted God to keep doing things but yet I believe that what God is teaching us is that if God would go through repetition through sign and wonder sign and wonder what he's wanting you to do is One Day begin to realize well if you can do that I can do it too through you I can take you out your word and I don't have to treat you like a genie in the bottle and I don't have to try to conjure up some work but I can believe that the same God who did that to my fathers is the same God living in me and I can trust him for the moment I'm living it because my hope is in God thank you Lord they sinned more against him by provoking the most high in the world all these wonders all these wonders all these Wonders that they saw that they drank that they handled that they felt that they and they still sinned the more and this is another poet poetical uh poetic description of this and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust they just drank the water oh we can get water out of a rock maybe we can get meat out of the sky and they spake against God they said can God furnish a table in the wilderness notice that there there's not this it's something's wrong as as they said their spirit's not Stead fast with God they're they're more adversarial listen I think this is one of those things that the devil just slips in and causes amongst fellowships and friends and in relationships and parents to children and uh spouses to one another if you could just twist it enough to refill that your adversaries so that nothing you ever talk about you're in it together it's almost as if you're arguing one with one another and they never viewed God as a partner in The Exodus and they never really wanted to be on God's side and say okay this is what you're doing we're with you we're steadfast with you and so that they could go forward it was always as if there was this adversarial relationship oh well then can you can you make a table in the wilderness behold he smok the rock that the waters gushed out and streams overflowed can he give bread also notice this attitude can he provide flesh for his people therefore the Lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also came up against Israel because they believed not in God and trusted not in his salvation the same thing has happened today in the message of the hour where there's such a lust for the table in the wilderness such a lust for the water out of the rock such a lust for the Mana from Heaven and the meat and the bread and all the Miracles and signs and wonders but through it all they do not believe anymore in God nor are they trusting in the Salvation that has been brought to them they never learned or grasped there was never this I just love the way the Bible says it they had never they were never steadfast their Spirits were never steadfast with God they never were caught up in his ways though he was manifesting himself repeatedly amongst them he has made known his acts unto the children of Israel but he had made known his ways unto Moses the acts are all the things we've read in 1 Corinthians 10 and Psalm 78 these acts that everyone could participate in everyone could eat everyone can read everyone could do these things all could walk through these processes but only Moses really had known is it says he not only necessarily but I've made known my ways unto Moses ways could mean a road a a a path it could mean a direction or even a journey but it also means manner this habit this course of life this moral character it comes from a tread or bend to march to cause to go or to lead through everything that God was doing they saw his acts but they never were steadfast with his leadership they didn't know where it was pointing they could see him do something in other words they could maybe if I could use this you could see the footprint but you can't tell which way it's going you can see the evidence of someone's presence but you don't know how long they had been there and where what direction they're headed the manner the course of Life the character he made known his acts to the whole of children of Israel but he wanted to show his ways or make known his ways under the individual his character his manner his habit and Israel did not take advantage of the opportunity that was given them to know God in a deeper way yes superficial a pretense I want to like to say it this way and I know that we use the subject of character quite a bit but his his mannerisms he he made his he made known his ways his mannerisms to Moses and we can say his works oh it is his character's course of Life his journey something richer and deeper to Moses but yet kind of The Superficial the outward he made known to the children of Israel yet his mannerisms his works there are they are his characteristics and something is known by its characteristics we use the story of of Solomon and how brother brandham uses that and God identified in his characteristics how Solomon could pick up on these were women based upon the way they acted in their particular Manner and so it's his characteristics and characteristics are those things that indicate one's character these are distinctive traits so we could say that actions and things you say and the way that you look are the expressions of identity they are the attributes or characteristics yet seeing the characteristics is one thing but knowing his character is greater it's like knowing the Bible and knowing the author it's setting before a Manet or looking at a painting be able to see it and think it's beautiful wow I could never do that but then to actually know the inspiration of the artist and and the context and all those other things and I know I'm trying to use a carnal example to really tap into Supernatural things but God wants us to see it and view it and not just admire the work but he wants us to understand the work itself the process the mind the motive the objective the reasons behind things I thank God that I've been able to come to this point and Lord willing pick up it on pick up on Sunday on holiness cuz I could not bring myself to do it to a Wednesday night crowd like well that just would be cruel that would be like trading Luca for ad or something like that it just wouldn't make any sense but seeing his attributes is one thing but knowing his character by it completely different in other words saying I see what you did there oh wow I I'm picking up what you're laying down I'm inspired by this that this is something that enthusias me I I understand I see what you're doing not knowing his ways if we could take it from Psalms and Hebrews and Corinthians and these different places not knowing his way today puts us in danger of departing from his his character and repeating the mistakes of yesterday if we do not know his way today hear his voice today it puts us in danger of repeating prior generation mistakes here we are today in a situation where so much that we draw from is done and recorded between 47 and 65 and we haven't led up in we should have leted up in listening to it and reading it and sharing it and talking about it being inspired by it and yet we can go back to that time and we can say well Generations are dying and there's many that have rejected and many that fall away and there's very fewer and fewer voices of our fathers who actually experienced those Supernatural works but yet here we are a generation that heard our fathers tell us about it and then we want to continue to tell our generation about it in the future and the lesson is that some of our fathers hardened their hearts and they been they they've been overthrown in the wilderness Wilderness and now I like Wilderness that's a that's a good combination of different things and here we are wanting to say don't make the same mistake yet we ourselves are not the same Witnesses they were it's a challenge to not make the same mistake that they made in Judges chapter 2: 6-15 and when Joshua had let the people go I'm using this to show this example of if we don't know his ways today no matter how great it was yesterday if we don't know his ways today there's this danger of ending up like this in judges 2 and when Joshua had let the people go the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land that was a process of possession and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old they buried him in the border of his inheritance in the Mount of Ephraim and on the north side of the Hill gash and also all that generation were gathered under their fathers so here's this this death and and there arose another generation after them you see there was this Joshua Elders that outlive Joshua all that generation are gathered to their fathers and there Rises up a generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel and we could say well of course not they weren't there for it they weren't there in the in Egypt they weren't there in the wilderness they weren't there when they crossed over they weren't there when they the walls of Jericho fell down and so it's a different time it's a different season but notice this danger in in not being knowledgeable of what he done what he had accomplished and done they they the danger wasn't knowing the history the danger was not learning his ways by it please catch that part and the children of Israel verse 11 did evil in the sight of the Lord and served balum and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the Gods of the people that were around about them and bowed themselves under them and provoked the Lord to anger I'll stop reading it there but verse 14 it says that there was that what happened is God turned them over to their enemies they could no longer stand before their enemies and where does it begin they're raised up a generation that didn't know the Lord I said did they they didn't know there was a god well I don't know if it was a matter of them not not knowing there was a God but they didn't know his ways they didn't know the works that he had done there might have been stories told of how they ended up there they might have known there was one true God listen there's a way that even today as isolated as we may be and as a different this as this message may be and as different as you young ladies and young men might feel when it comes to well we believe the message and we believe God sent a prophet and you have friends that are Baptist you have friends that do this and friends that do that as weird as you might seem there's a way to where we can actually believe in something and acknowledge its existence but not actually know it and be able to appreciate and know the works which God has done and because they did not learn his ways because we see already that they could have learned all the stories and knew all the stories and they could have had wonderful coloring books of of all the things that God had did and they might have been able to really enjoy H uh different media to kind of immerse them in these certain things but if you don't know his ways right The Works don't mean anything to you in the end maybe I could have said that better but hope you get my point so Psalms 25: 1-4 let me try to get to that moment we referred to it a little bit ago unto thee Oh Lord do I lift up my soul oh my God I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me what caused the enemies to triumph over the children of Israel in the Book of Judges the fact that they no longer knew the Lord and his works not just to his acts made known but his ways shown don't let my enemies triumph over me yay let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed which transgress without cause so what is say cry to not be triumphed over show me thy ways oh Lord teach me thy paths Lead Me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on thee do I wait all the day today if you will hear his voice today if you will hear the voice voice of God he is teaching you how to live soberly and righteously and godly in this 2025 in the 21st century he wants to teach you his ways and to teach you his paths and Lead You In the truth not a historical lesson not trying to put ourselves in situations where we could pray and ask God to part the Waters of Lake Pleasant nor should we put ourselves in a situation where we're travailing for food and we want God to rain quell out of Heaven though that would be kind of nice if you're quail hunting but it's it's not that we try to duplicate a scene from the past and cause our lives to imitate the art of a day gone by but rather we want God's way in his path Today Show me your ways if you made known your ways unto Moses your manner of Life your spirit your character then I know that if I have the life the characteristics will follow and I don't need to try to model myself after the characteristics I just want to know your ways thank you Lord even David after he had fallen and sinned and the prophit had exposed his Heir in Psalm 5110 to13 create in me a clean heart why because that's where you Heir you air in your heart it said that these people always a in their heart their hearts are far from me they Heir in their heart they have not known my ways their Spirits were not steadfast with me so David prays give me a clean heart creating me a clean heart oh God and renew a right spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee there's no there there's not a path for anybody else that he is not able to be a witness listen we are not going to be effective Witnesses while we're still bowed down with the shame of our fornication and adultery and our our unclean dalliances in the world you're not going to be a to be able to have power over the enemy as you ought to right if you're not taking heed to his ways to his word create in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit In Me cast not your presence away from me and if I could get a right Spirit if I could get a clean heart then I'll be able to teach transgressors thy ways because then I'll know your heart I'll know your ways Sinners shall be converted unto thee when I know your way as Paul was admonishing in Titus the grace of God that brings salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that if we can deny the world and deny ungodliness and say no to these worldly lust we will be able to live soberly righteously and godly in the now in the in that time in that first century he said this is what you can do the grace of God has appeared teaching and Peter said one day that same Grace is going to come again there's going to be a revelation of Jesus Christ it's going to bring to you a Grace there's going to be a Salvation revealed in the last time and it comes teaching again that today if you will deny the world say no to worldly lust you can live soberly righteously and godly in the 21st century amen and Peter comes back to it in verse 14 1 Peter 1:14 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust and your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy I'm I'm I'm moving into a whole another subject area now or just what this all was the foundation for Lord will and will pick up for pick up on it on Sunday morning but be holy that's separated it's it's a consecration it's a dedication be separated as God is separate I'm hearing you and I I I can see the the black and white I can I I can read the letters I can hear it resounding in my mind but it says that I am to be I'm called he that has called me is Holy so I am to be holy in my manner of life he is a holy God I need to be holy in my life so what fash would this look like a god who cannot be seen and so we start to imagine well what would what would God be like and what would we do and we think well you know what kind of clothes does God wear and you know how does he sleep at night and what would he say in this situation we say well maybe that's a little bit beyond me I want a god with skin on them so we begin to look through the Bible and we begin to look at the prophets we look at Jesus Christ we look at the disciples we look at the lives of those Believers that we have in our lives we look at the minister of William brandham there's a way where we're trying to understand what this fashion would look like if we obedient children not fashioning ourselves after our former lust when we were ignorant but now being enlightened to the ways of God what does that fashion look like brother Bram in the sermon the sea does not air with a shock he says he that is great he that this great mystery of God made known how that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world how that he and the fathers were one how that the great Mysteries of the fulfilling of God taking and bringing himself this this is the a paradox I want you to think of as the one who have called you as holy you be holy as this God that is above all things this God that is greater than all things this God who is Holy and clean and pure there's no darkness in him there's no shadow of turn there's no variableness in him you be holy yourself as well the same God bringing himself manifesting in the age of human beings in the Stream of human beings and in the company of human beings he's going to fit into that age of humans the stream of humans the company of humans if I can say this this is my words he's going to look simp he's going to look really human in some ways that going to share this common basis that we all share we are all at the basis simply human to make his word manifested in the day and the Eastern rising of the Sun and to do the same thing as the sun sets in the west to make himself manifested in a bride Church the word made manifest it will too he that understandeth that is to know that's been revealed to them of him that sent me has everlasting life and will not come into judgment but has passed from Death un life as he that has called you is Holy you be holy it's not the form of godliness but the actual way what is the fashion of God what would it look like I know I've been repeating this for the first uh month or so of the year that there is this God is wanting to make himself known we could say a life lived by the word will be the word expressed all these different thingses that I've been trying to come at I want to be able to narrow it down Lord willing on Sunday to very specific things that we know frame the life of a Christian there's a way that I can look a way that I can act and a way that I can present myself and treat other people that we should be able to say according to the word of God is outside the framing of what a Christian is to be that this is not the characteristics of God this is not how God would present in the day and age that we're living in I I I'm not going to try to go back and look like a Christ of the first generation I'm not going to try to go back and look like David in the BC ages but what would he look like today and there's certain things that are going to be framed that we need to be careful say oh well I can't believe that they look like this why doesn't everybody wear white why doesn't everybody drive an electric vehicle why doesn't everybody do this but there's certain things that we can say Christ will be in this hour we could create our own form but we want to know his way because it's only by knowing his way that you can live the life Brothers you could come to your instruments hope I didn't put everybody to sleep in the sermon God is identified by his characteristics let's just let's let's really consider this this is a prayer that he's asking so let's just think about this and I I I I'll I'll I'll read I'll say the prayer and if you something your heart identifies with it I'm going to give you the opportunity to stand and say that's my prayer that's what I want God is identified by his characteristics and may Our Lives be so fitted with the word that the word will become flesh Among Us and will give the people Faith to draw from their account in heaven as David said Lord I give me a clean heart give me a right Spirit teach me your ways and if I can know your ways then I can teach transgressors your ways Sinners can be converted because my life is going to be a living testimony I'm not just going to be a work of art but I'm going to understand the work of art I'm going to understand the process I understand what God's heart is in his mind I I'm going to know way to I want to have wisdom to approach a siner I want to have wisdom to approach a situation so that Christ can be magnified am in my life amen may my life be so fitted with the word that the word will become flesh in my life and it'll actually give people Faith to draw from their account in heaven which Jesus settled for them long ago for their sins and sickness and they're in the journey he says bless us now we pray as we wait on thee to reveal to us Thy word and make it flesh Among Us brother Brandon preaching that those series of sermons which I have a whole list of them where he's dealing with this particular thought God identified by his characteristics there was something behind that characteristic an act attribute a characteristic is God God's identified by them that that is that is how he's identified so then I could just look at the work of art and say wow that's amazing look what he's doing but God through that expression is saying do you see me do you hear my heart C can you can you not strive against me can your heart be steadfast with me can you catch the beat and the rhythm of the hour through these things that's happening and not just see a miracle like oh my goodness he can do that well can you do this but he can do that well that's awesome can you do this and God just constantly does this to generation after generation and to think that in the out day and hour we're living in that so many people in the message are wanting to go back to those tables in the wilderness they're wanting to go back to that kind of display and that kind of enthusiasm without knowing his way they're really really amped up about the acts but they're not concerned with knowing his way let us not be guilty of disregarding the very heart of God and what he's trying to teach us in these things so that the word can be made flesh amongst us and there can be living today 21st century christs not even the 20th century 21st Cent Century Christ oh would Jesus have a cell phone which one are you talking about Paul said who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest well today would Jesus have a cell phone you tell me Woody asking the real questions now aren't we right Phillip right asking the real questions well I'm just going to go I'm just going to say yeah because I've got one I can least say well my wife has one I mean it's closest Christ as I can my father-in-law has one I mean I I think I don't think Jesus I Think Jesus would have his cell phone you notice how arbitrary we could just draw a line but even if Jesus wouldn't own a cell phone in not owning a cell phone you'll never know his way by the absence of a cell phone until you can see the heart and the motive behind it and the character and how they handle it how they approach a situation how they handle disagreement how they even things that rub you the wrong way and things that make you uncomfortable the way that you handle those things is going to declare the nature and character of Christ we can all sit back and call out a bad meal that was horrible that didn't taste good at all well you do it better tell me what was wrong with it what what what was missing what was I don't know it just didn't taste good to me so much more that we can know from Christ so much we should long for we should desire so many things we want to see if I said a moment ago and I think what it said is that Israel did not take advantage of the opportunity to know God in a deeper way and maybe that could be our prayer tonight I want my life so fitted with the word that the word will become flesh in me that I could become a conduit of his ways so that Sinners transgression can be taught let's stand to our feet I know some of you just forgot to stand I believe that you it resonated with you you want you want this in your heart you want this in your life so let's bow our heads in a word of [Music] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father tonight as we stand in your divine presence as we close this service we ask that you take these things which have been shared Lord I realize that on one hand it's very simple but in another way very profound and important and I ask that you would make it real to the believer's hearts tonight Lord when I say believer I realize that there's people here who need to receive you who've been fighting you who have not yielded who still have a work that needs to be done on their heart and Lord I believe that you're calling to them through these things Lord there's those here who are veterans of the cause they've stood they've persevered Lord they've Advanced and they've part of the foundation that we're standing upon as Believers today and as young people yet Lord they need to be reminded to be steadfast and Lord regardless of where we stand tonight I believe this word is applicable on so many different levels and I would say Lord we want to know as David said teach me your ways show me your paths I don't want to just see signs and wonders though I've prayed for them though I tried to encourage them and though I believe they're present in our body Lord I do not want to just see the the reflection as an image but I want to know your heart and know your mind I want to I want to catch that heartbeat of God lord we could all sit back and listen to your Symphony but do we know our part do we know what each sounding reflects and do we know what it means and do we know what it's presenting and how it it's part of the part of the conductor and the one that wrote the piece that it's telling a story almost as it were signaling to us the direction the pace the destination for us to meet you in the air we'll never be able to make it to that meeting by just sitting back and seeing your works we need to know your ways show us your ways Lord as you did to your servant Moses do so to us as you did to your servant brother bam do so to us Lord show us your way your heart your mind open up to us your character not just your attributes you're identified by them but Lord I want to be identified with them myself I pray for the people here tonight heal Hearts I pray for brother jet Lord tonight that you'd move upon his situation Lord I pray for the different ones who are sick who are hurting facing difficult situations Lord there's some that have been out of church all year there's some who find themselves being pressed from different sides financially and depression Lord I pray that you would be present with them Lord Jesus I believe that if we could know your ways we can see a way out even in the very places we're reading where you talk about the mistakes of times past and the different things that Israel had gone through Lord that you even tell us that you will with this temptation make a way of Escape you are the way the truth the life I don't want to just hear about it I just want to be told about it I don't want to just believe that it's real I want to know it Lord for I shall know the truth and the truth shall make me make me free Lord liberate our Spirits create in us a clean heart renew the right spirit in US Lord that it can be steadfast with you I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music]
