TRANSCRIPT
========================================
isaiah chapter 55 reverses 1 to 13. it's the whole chapter i'm not going to be able to touch on maybe some of the parts um from verse in you know even verses 6 to 13 but i wanted just to have them in the background is i've been focusing on this subject for some time now and it's just been really captivating my attention oh everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price he's talking about the value of it can't even be measured wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfyeth not hearken diligently unto me and ee that which is good and let your soul delight in its fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david behold i have given him for witness to the people a leader and commander to the people behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not in nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee israel recognized this as a prophecy of the messiah and how all nations would come in the glorious light of the messiah to worship in israel verse 6 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down on the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that go with forth out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void but will accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorns shall come up the fir tree and instead of the bride shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen you can have your seats my title is i am hungry and it's calling on a sermon that we ministered a little bit earlier this year it may have been in march sometime i can't remember exactly when but i think it was in march on hungary and asking the question are you hungry or kind of provoking thought to consider what kind of longings and desires that someone might have within themselves and so since we were asking the question hungry now this is uh just the response of the believer i am hungry there is a hunger and thirst in my heart and i want to begin by looking in john chapter 6 and we'll be reading a few verses i think beginning around verse 33 but as we ministered on it last time the last time we ministered on this subject we were identifying how in john chapter five uh you know the different miracles that were being accomplished and how that after jesus had accomplished these wonderful miracles people sought him and there were multitudes of people that sought christ because they had ate bread and they'd ate fish and it satisfied their natural hunger and so they were hungry and they felt the pangs of hunger maybe a stomach growling and the bible says that you did eat and you were full so they were satisfied this natural urge that every man or woman would have this natural need that we have as humans was met and it was so miraculous because man has need to eat and here was hands that could take fish and take bread and multiply it and the base need that every man has and we have in common and has to has to partake in in order to live and to have life and to enjoy life was provided by the hands of the messiah so people were drawn to that and jesus rebuked him saying look you're coming to me because your bellies are full and you would want to see more miracles that do something for your flesh and what we identified is how their natural hunger and the natural needs that were met were more important than the word that could meet their spiritual needs the the natural satisfaction the things that it could do to the flesh the things that it even energized them in their emotions and their spirits it meant more to them than really the deep eternal uh the word and how it could meet eternal needs and supernatural needs and spiritual needs as we know just even identifying how christ was coming to rescue them from sin this is the great deliverance this is what the messiah was for that was the bondage that they could be loosed from not not worrying about how you're going to get your next meal there was something greater than all of that and so they were unconscious to how this natural desire was warping their sense of value that they could see a miracle take place and and instead of it awakening them think think well he's taking bread and fish and he's multiplying it we've never seen anything like this before and and instead of catching their attention to think what's going on here this is let's get past the surface of this let's get past the bread and the fish and and the meat and cheese and let's really think what could this be instead of them recognizing that this natural desire being drawn to the natural benefit kind of warped their sense of value because they would have been happy just getting more bread they would have been happy with getting more fish so i think as we said before it kind of this hunger this natural hunger in the flesh and this desire of the flesh had hijacked their thinking to where it wasn't getting down deep to the real root of what mattered and we were looking at how they had not fully caught the supernatural significance of the sign so here's a sign that's being performed before them and they don't catch the real supernatural significance behind it here's a miracle being performed but the purpose of the miracle hasn't fully overwhelmed them because they're still just wanting to see the miracle they're still just wanting to see something happen that can satisfy their flesh and so they had not fully grasped who it was that was in their midst they hadn't fully recognized that this was the messiah and what he came to do so jesus says in john chapter 6 verses 33 to 35 for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world now they had in in wrestling with this question they had brought up well uh moses gave us bread in the wilderness and and moses k the bread came by the hand of moses and jesus kind of rebukes them in that so they they bring the exodus into view they bring the bread that came down in the wilderness into view but jesus is now saying that moses didn't give you that bread god gave you that bread and the bread that god gives is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world and in john chapter six jesus is specifically pointing to himself as the living bread of life that is more important than any daily bread that is actually more significant and more precious than daily food he's saying i am the bread of god i am the living bread of life and so when he says for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world they said unto him lord evermore give us this bread let us have of this bread that we may eat of it give it give us more of this if this really is bread that we can eat and it's from god then we want more of it but in asking for the bread that they may eat just even what they say they didn't they're not saying whoa this bread of god which comes down from heaven let us let us receive him let us have him that it may give his life and energize us they're still using a language that well lord give us this bread we're hungry let us have this bread they were still asking for natural bread they were still asking for natural meat which would prolong on their days upon earth or nurture their flesh and give them the vitamins and the energy that they need jesus says in verse 35 i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst what a remarkable statement he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst now someone could read that and again the the jews that day could be saying well if i never am thirsty again if i'm never hungry again and i can just live and have have vitality and energy and life with never having to eat never having to drink again then i'll take that but clearly jesus is pointing to a greater thirst and a greater hunger that natural bread cannot satisfy he's pointing to something great he says i am the bread of life this is the living bread of life he that joins together with him he that cometh to me is going to receive substance that satisfies the deep groaning within his heart he that comes to this fountain is going to drink of something to where he'll never thirst again and we looked at john chapter 4 how that jesus had come to the well and there was a woman of samaria there drawing water and jesus asked for some water and she says well the well is deep you have nothing to draw with and jesus said if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink and there's kind of this back and forth going on between them and jesus is saying hey the water i have if you'll partake of it you'll never thirst again and in john chapter 4 verse 14 it says the woman said unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw and so again her her response is very similar to what jesus says later in john chapter six i'm the bread of life if you come to me you'll never hunger you partake of me you'll never thirst he says this to the woman of samaria and says i have this water that'll come forth and she says give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw but yet we we understand from the scripture that it had not fully dawned on her what he was referring to that she really wasn't catching the significance of it and and i want to just take a moment to correct something maybe just correct some emphasis that i had made on that sunday when we ministered on this i as i look at this scripture as i've always understood the scripture when she says lord give me this water that i thirst not that i neither come hither to draw as we read that it strikes us that she's obviously saying lord give me this water so that i never thirst again and give me this water that i that that i don't have to come hither to draw if i can end this exercise it'll be great and and what has struck me even that week as i studied up to this point is how that she's still looking at it in a natural sense she's thinking that if she could get this water she's never going to have to come draw water again so really the emphasis of the scripture and what the scripture is trying to identify is that she wasn't fully catching what jesus was saying and and so i think that's the clear meaning of the scripture and and i recall as i was ministering on this it just struck me in a different way and so my emphasis i believe that morning was that she's saying that i didn't even thirst for this water i wasn't coming to draw this water whatever water you're offering i i'm not thirsty for and i don't need and i just wanted to point out that i realized maybe my emphasis in that moment might be a little bit different than what we've always understood the scripture to be and i don't want my emphasis in the moment change what our understanding of the word is so if it seemed to be a little bit confusing i just wanted to correct uh just how in that moment it struck me how to where she's not fully recognizing it and i don't know why i read it that way when i was reading it then she says this is not water i was thirsty for this is not water that i came to draw that was my emphasis the scripture is very clear that she's saying give me water so that i never thirst again and that i don't have to come to draw but it's the same response as these broth these uh men and and women in john 36 chapters 36 chapter six where they say well let us have this ever more lord give us this bread and when jesus is emphasizing how he's the bread which came down from heaven i am the bread of life i am the one that comes down out of heaven it says in john chapter 6 41 the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven when he's clearly identified himself as the one that they would have to partake of this is where they murmured against him and we know that we could even imagine how they say well does he literally mean that we have to take his flesh and drink his blood is this some sort of uh human sacrifice cult what kind of death cult is this what what kind of vampirism is this and they said this and they said in verse 42 when he says i am the bread of life verse 42 is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i am come down from heaven what did this identify as we look at the difference between the woman of samaria and these these in john chapter 6 there was no hunger for true redemption though the woman of samaria was saying well you know give me this water there still was a further unfolding and a further expression of the word that quickens something inside of her because she's redeemable and she hungered for that she thirst for that and because she was hungry for redemption the word met that need that she had in her heart but these others in john chapter 6 they had no there was no greater thirst that could be quickened by the manifestation of the word the word is just firing off the word is being manifested the word is being uh made clear before them and there was nothing in them to quicken and so here they are asking jesus about the the miracles and they come finding oh you only seek me because you saw the the bread and you saw the multiplication of food and that's why you're here and they said well even moses gave us bread in the wilderness and the miracles in the wilderness that they even pointed to was speaking of a greater bread like the very subject matter they point to to try to get jesus to multiply the bread and multiply the fish jesus could go right back to that very instance and said well did not the lord say that he did this so that you would recognize that the word is greater that if god is going to pour out bread into the wilderness and cause quail to fall in the morning then what you ought to do when that happens is not develop this sense of entitlement that we need more bread and we need more quail but to fear the god that can drop bread down every morning and listen to the god that's allowing quail to come to meet your needs and so instead of just getting so narrowed in on the fact that oh we're eating we're drinking we have what we need to say wait a minute who is it that could do this to recognize that his word must be greater his promises must be greater if he could do this then he can do greater and so they had no hunger for redemption there was no nothing deeper inside of them because even the miracle that they pointed to spoke of something greater in deuteronomy chapter eight verse three and i know this is i'm taking much more time with the review than i thought i would but but i'm enjoying it so if you don't mind just humor me and it says in deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 3 and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger so he allowed them to get hungry and fed thee with manna so he's feeding them with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only so why did he cause the bread to come down out of heaven he suffered them to hunger then fed them with manna he suffered them the hunger and then fed them with quail well why did he do this supernatural work why did he do this sign before him it says so that he listen that man doth not live by bread alone that they may know that this quail and this man and this bread is not the only substance that they ought to live by but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live as we were reading in isaiah 55 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth what is it it's like the seed that goes forth then the rain goes forth and then the plant comes up and it brings forth the grain and then the grain is taken and brought made into bread that it might be bread to the eater he says so my word that comes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but shall accomplish that which i please it shall prosper the thing whereunto i sent it in the thing wherein to i sent it just as the rain comes upon the seed and the eater enjoys the bread and it benefits the sower it benefits the eater he's saying my word is like that the word that goeth forth out of my mouth has a purpose and it has an intent and so he wanted the reason why he pours out this manna is so that they may know that man does not live by bread only as jesus says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live one translation says but by all which is created by the word of the lord is the life of man wanting them to recognize that there's something greater and when god says this in deuteronomy chapter 8 when jesus refers to it later in matthew chapter 3 it's not suggesting and here jesus or excuse me god is not suggesting that the israelites wouldn't ever need natural food once they came into the promised land but that they had to live by obeying the voice of god this is the emphasis man does not live by bread alone or bad only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth the lord doth man live man should live by obeying god's word through dependence upon god's word through obedience to god's word they would continue under his provision they would continue under his protection does that not summarize what god said to him as long as you listen to my word and obey my word as you as long as you obey and as long as you depend upon me as long as you obey me as long as you continue under under my word then i will continue to provide and i will continue to protect it as soon as you stop trusting me as soon as you stop depending upon me as soon as you stop obeying me then my provision and my protection is going to be taken away and that was what he wanted israel to learn that man is not just going to live by having manna man is not just going to live by having quail and it's not bread from the ground and water from the rock but it these things these miracles and these signs spoke of a greater word that they could attach themselves to and needed to depend upon and needed to obey in order to live thus we do not live in our body only by meat this is how jesus even emphasizes it when he's being tempted to turn these stones into bread he says well man shall not live by bread alone we do not live in our body only by bread only by meat but in our soul we live in our soul by the word of god the believer lives a spiritual life by feeding on christ the word this is the emphasis that's been in my heart over the last few days is it so important for us to not forget this as believers to always if we can if i say this always have an edge on us we're always we're always seem to have this penchant or this hunger for the word of god realizing that no matter what blessings come my way no matter how good things get no matter how healthy i feel and how good my job is and how great these my income is at this time and i'm debt free and i'm healthy and these are happening or great things are happening no matter what seems to be going well or even what seems to be going wrong in the world that we must have a hunger for the word of god and not lose sight of that not lose sight of how precious the scripture is not lose sight of how precious the voice of god on this day is and take advantage of how these things are made available to us that we could feed on and listen to chur having church twice a week if we have three services a week if we had four services a week that should never be a substitute for you feeding on the word of god and actively feeding on the things that god has provided us because man shall not live by bread alone but he lives by the word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's what the scriptures are pointing to we cannot trust in ourselves to support life we have to trust in god because it's god's word and i say this in all things it's god's word that brings its efficiency i say if you if you have a sufficient income if christ isn't in it it can become insufficient very quickly you can have sufficient food for health but if christ isn't in it it can become insufficient or deficient very quickly so in everything we do and everything we endeavor to do and everything we say and everything we eat everything we set forth to do there ought to be thanksgiving given to god saying that i know that if there's any good thing that's come from you and that through christ things could be made sufficient if i could join what we're speaking on sunday to this in psalms 100 verse 3 know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture it is he that hath made us he's the designer he's the creator he's the one that in creating us has given us a particular intent but he's designed us wherein we have certain needs we have certain feelings we have certain wants we have things ways about us that only he knows we have not made ourselves but he has made us and then in this description of how that we have been made it says that we are his people and the sheep of his pasture in other words he has made us and then set us and ordained us for a field where we can eat where we can be safe we can be protected we can be provided for and he's the one that's going to be given care and oversight over us and so he's made us a particular way he's made us with needs he's made us with desires he's made us with weaknesses and vulnerabilities that he can protect and so that causes us to be as sheep who are dependent upon the shepherd i can't just run off into the mountains and find what i need i need to stay in the field where he's feeding i can't just go and take care of myself because i need one to to to to manage my care and to look out after me and it's he that has made me and he's the one that knows best and so these scriptures are speaking to how that we should not depend upon natural things alone but depend absolutely entirely in even immediately instinctively on god for life and all things we ought to be dependent upon him if it's he that has made us and we are his people and the sheep of his pasture then it evokes this image of a dependent sheep that i'm relying upon you i'm absolutely entirely and instinctively immediately depending upon you for the preservation of my body for the protection of my life for provision for protection for pleasure i am entirely dependent upon you it is he that hath made us and he's made us to hunger he's made us to thirst not just for bread alone but by for the word that comes from his mouth in chapter 10 of the church age book when brother branham is giving the resume of the ages and he's kind of going back through and summarizing he refers to the the first church age and i had been uh looking at this how the the first church age they had left their first love it has such remarkable depth to it i i've been pondering it very deeply and it says already that first age had turned now when they had left their first love this is how brother brown begins to describe their turning from following the pure word of god so the word was their first love they had turned from following the pure word of god and notice they turned from god's demand so christ the word is their first love but now he says they've turned from god's demand it is he that hath made us not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pastor now this is the demand of the creator this is a very important statement to us and i hope that you could write this down if not we can make it available to you they had turned from god's demand what is it that god demands what is it that god requires what is it that god wants a church absolutely dependent upon him this is what he wants therefore we recognize that our maturity in christ does not produce an arrogancy or presumptive attitude where we feel that we can be more independent of him but as we grow and as we mature we begin to yield more become more dependent and more needy and the world thinks man what are you becoming just this big push pushover a big weakling and say well maybe in your eyes but in his eyes i'm maturing i'm becoming more dependent because god demands a church not just sometimes dependent like when we're sick and things aren't going well no he wants us absolutely dependent upon him and then i love this parenthetical phrase depending entirely upon god to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government god demands us as individuals to be in absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon him to start and to finish so what they had done is they had turned from god's requirement to be absolutely dependent upon him and they turned to nicolaitanism that's a big word you can do it in scrabble it might work out well for you nicolaitanism they turn to nicolatinism and here's brother branham's definition which is organizing a human government within the church which is all governments do legislate for the people so there would be an organizing of a human government which was to legislate for the people there was some substitution there was replacement they turned from being absolutely and entirely dependent upon the lord and they turned to human government human government would be the bur would be birthed by human intuition and human instinct and human desire human needs and all these base instincts of man he said they did exactly what israel did so brother brahms identifying the heir of israel he's identifying it in the church how they could have relied upon god for everything but instead they say how can we protect this truth how can we set up government how can we see that this thing keeps going how can we protect our borders and protect our people and protect our sheep and make sure that this keeps going and so the organized human government and church order and church location and church services in church offices in church structure and church services became all that the people needed to feel like everything's good now you could really think about this for a long time and realize this is a very very deep a statement of brother branham's to identify nicolaitanism and how broad it is sometimes we say oh that's just nicolaitanism because we're looking at maybe a pastor who abuses the sheep and but there's also an agreement on the people's part to lay aside their individual duty lay aside their discernment lay aside their need for something and have the church just satisfy all of it and kind of have a figurehead that governs all of it and then feel like hey everything's good we're having church aren't we it's organizing the human government to legislate for the people to make their decisions tell them what to do they did exactly what israel did what god warned it would happen when they took a king he says they took the expediency of human government why because there can be efficiencies there can be expediency there can be hey this works this seems well they took the expediency of human government instead of the word and the spirit it's not in what was uh it's it i think i need to be very careful how to say this it's not in the order it's not in the church it's not in the service where god was displaced it was in keeping the word and the spirit out of it it was in looking in just the fact that we could have these things the expediency of it they thought well if we could have order and we could have structured we could have government we could have authority they look to the expediency and the effectiveness of human government instead of allowing the word to have the preeminence and allow and that word having the pyramids is what gives the spirit preeminence this is god's demand that you be absolutely dependent upon him this is god's demand of our church that we be absolutely dependent upon him and we should never take the expediency of human government as a substitute for the word and the spirit this is what israel did they were no longer depending upon god to fulfill his word from start to finish this is what we can say that jesus was identifying this is what deuteronomy 8 is identifying this is what psalms 100 identifies is that we as sheep must live by the word that comes from his mouth so in isaiah 55 is identifying this bread that's going to come out of heaven has a purpose as an intent and we must feed on it in order to be successful to be happy in amos chapter 8 verses 11 and 12 said behold the days come saith the lord that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water this is what god says you know you that are thirsty for water come to the waters you that uh wants milk come and get and who that they don't have bread you come he's saying to come he said i'm gonna send to famine but not for bread and not for water but of hearing the words of the lord there's going to be a time where there'll be a famine and god will send the famine why does he send it because they love not the truth so actually since the famine when it was a time when they could have heard it they could have enjoyed it it was readily available and it seems as if it had this liberty and this freedom and it was being lifted up and they could partake of it whenever they wanted there's going to come circumstances there's going to come a dynamic in place to where there's going to be a famine for hearing the pure word of god just as they turned away from following in the first age at the end of time there's going to be a famine for the pure word of god where he says they shall wander from sea to sea and from north to even to the east and they shall run to a throat to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it that's how precious it's going to be i i like to look at it this way this is this is how it's been striking me that there's going to be those and again maybe this is my emphasis now and i'm just speaking this is how it strikes me there's going to be those that recognize that the word isn't being preached there's going to be those that recognize just how important it is for the word to be preached and they're going to be hungry for it and they're going to be looking for it and they're going to find that it's a precious resource and it's very scarce but there will be those that will value the word over other things over politics over personality over pretense over over amenities and programs and have you seen their sunday school get up my goodness it's awesome let's all go there they're going to value the word greater than things that it can do on these fringes and these extracurriculars he says they shall run to and fro to seek the word and shall not find it it speaks that there are going to be those looking for it but now brother branham emphasizes that this is a last day scripture there's going to be a famine not for bread not for water famine is a shortage or it's a lacking of that which is necessary to live the use of the word famine is used to indicate an appetite something that's a very strong feeling something that needs fulfilling but yet it's not met it's something that's unfulfilled and catch this as we've identified in john chapter six i want you to make this connection now that the famine is not a shortage of bread the famine is not a shortage of water and how did jesus place this miracle that he did he performed a miracle was it supernatural absolutely did they want to see it again yes but why because of what it did for their bodies and so the shortage is not of bread the shortage is not a water it it it's even showing that there can be certain things that we can enjoy and benefit from and and the shortage is going to be something that doesn't pertain to a blessing on the flesh but feeds the soul it's not a shortage of the spirit being poured out because does the bible not say that in the last days i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh it says it that's what the bible says is going to happen it says but there's going to come there's going to i'm going to send to famine it's not going to be a famine of bread or the thirst of water why because there's going to be people that will enjoy things that do something for their spirits their emotions and their flesh but the real scarce resource is what feeds the soul are you are you are you thinking thinking about this and just how direct this is it's not a famine of bread nor the thirst of water but that doesn't mean there's not something sensitizing someone's flesh and their mind in religious service and making them feel satisfied because there's no famine of fanaticism there's no famine of personality cults there's no famine of of church gatherings there's no lacking of emotion there's no lacking of certain things but it's a famine of hearing the word and when you don't hear the word that creates a crisis of faith has anyone ever been there before now we're not blaming anyone but let's take responsibility ourselves we found ourselves in a crisis and we found out the reason why we're there is we're malnourished because faith cometh by hearing the word if we could just just summarize that very succinctly i cannot have a robust faith i cannot have an act of faith i cannot have a a a faith that brother man even calls unconscious in other words it's instinctive it's operating in the background it's there working when you don't know it i cannot have that kind of faith if i have not been feeding my soul with the word and we find ourselves in a crisis of doubt and raw emotion and and just kind of floundering a little bit and we were in that state because our faith has not been hearing the word to be very vital in that moment and powerful in that time so a famine of hearing the word creates a crisis of faith and this impacts our spiritual health so when the bible says there's going to be a famine for hearing the word of god you cannot remain as you are and not hear the word you're going to get worse off and if you're going to get worse often a lot of times it has to be there has to become there's more more dog and pony shows and smoke and mirrors to make everything look fine we have to do a lot of put on a lot of pretending and a lot of lying to ourselves and others to make everything look right when in reality there's a famine for hearing the word and things aren't right brother branham says in the message jezebel religion if you want a kind of a soft sermon to go to bed listening to you can listen to jezebel religion and brother brahms identifying how that they rejected elijah the prophet and after they had rejected him he says what set in war famine starvation you reject the word of god you're gonna set yourself up for fighting for starvation for famine thus saith the holy spirit this is brother branham now watch what's coming watch what's going to follow there was a famine there will be a famine oh maybe not for bread but for hearing the word of god and his truth there'll still be bread there'll still be water there'll still be certain things people continue on having church and doing things that gave them the indication that they were saved and they'll even be one that comes and performs signs and wonders even after the bride is taken out of the way and people will marvel at how great and wonderful it is and it's actually a manifestation of the antichrist and there'll be great commerce and they'll be great benefiting of certain different things but he's saying the real famine is hearing the word of god and his truth he says and the way his language here is so so moving all the churches will socialize and go right on into it just the same just like they've already been swallowed up with it the churches will socialize now i know that kind of gets our right wing gander up right socialism brother aaron it's creeping into the church it's it's not referring to socialism as far as an economic policy or a government but it's what church becomes churches will socialize and go right on into just the same it's it's the expediency of human government it's the posing of the word and the spirit and accepting a form and accepting culture and accepting order and accepting things other than letting the word have preeminence says there will be a famine oh maybe not for bread maybe not for charismatic services and a dynamic pouring out of the spirit upon all flesh but for hearing the word of god and his truth churches will socialize and go right on in just the same they've been swallowed up with it i i say this i want to be careful how i say it i'd like to say the biggest danger but let me say that where we need the greatest care and the thing that we ought not to be most concerned with is not the opposition to the truth or opposition against the message but the distraction from it that's where we're going to be the most vulnerable it's not so much the things that oppose the message and try to tear it down and and try to argue against it and try to point out its faults and and those things because really you've been bolstered by revelation uh though those things don't move you because you've been reading a bible that takes a revelation to understand and there's certain things in history and certain things and and grammar and certain things that could be pointed out in the bible and that doesn't stumble us because we've been restored back to a confidence in the word of god and so it's not the opposition to the truth that's going to trip us up usually it's the distraction from it when we get distracted from the truth you are attracted to the word and distracted by the world so if the world seems to kind of get its hooks in you and it's taking some of your time don't ever think that you're attracted to it and that's what you really like and you're being drawn to it no you're just being distracted by it you're attracted as the attraction as the elect of god is the word of god anything outside of that pulls you away is a distraction not an attraction and so this this hearing the word of god there's things things that want to keep us from it and gabriel's instructions to daniel he says i understand that in the last days they'll come a famine here's brother branham placing this the churches will be so organized and so set he says the churches will socialize and go right on into it now he says the churches will be so organized and so set it doesn't say denominations he says churches that in the last days they'll come a famine and it will not be for bread and water only but for hearing the true word of god you mean a church can socialize and be so organized and so set that the word can stop being preached and it can continue straight on yep a famine for hearing the word of god and people go from east and from west from north and the south seeking to hear the true word of god what is it this is a desire to hear it where can it be preached but the churches will be so organized and tightened up that they'll fail to hear it a desire to hear want to hear the word where's the word being preached where's the word lifted up but churches will be so organized and tightened up that people won't be allowed to hear it relax relax take a deep breath i won't be quoting from jezebel religion anymore tonight so you can just relax in the message spiritual food and due season let me check and make sure yeah i don't think i am if i do it's on accident how's that now notice how he places this in spiritual food and due season now we're going to type that with the spiritual drought of today now we all know we're very aware that there's a great spiritual drought in the in the land today spiritually speaking now you could have a very vibrant pentecostal move taking place at the time you could have ministries that are grabbing the people's attention and and things are taking place but this is the prophet who's diagnosing the real need and he recognizes the famine and it's a famine spiritually speaking and you know that was predicted by the prophet so now he's identifying amos chapter 8 just before the second coming of christ would be said there'll come a famine in the land and it won't be for bread alone but for hearing of the word of god and that day is now brother brahma identifies amos 8 1 11 and 12. he identifies it now he says and that day is now hearing the true word of god so what is the famine of it's not of church services it's not a it's not a song services and in prayer lines and the moving of the word of movement of the spirit of god and those different things it's not a famine for church it's not a famine for community it's not a famine for fellowship it's not a famine for government and those things but it's a famine for hearing the true word of god he said now this types the natural drought with the spiritual sin and unbelief by false teachers in modernness in the church that's a mouthful had brought the to the place to this coming oncoming judgment so false teaching and modernists in the church had brought them to a place of oncoming judgment then they had turned from god's word and his prophet so as he's using this example in the days of elijah and then he says they had turned from god's word and his prophet to a modern theological terms of the word you'll notice here it's just at that time that god always raises up something i love that part it's just at that time god always raises up something so the two sides of the ditch there can be a a misinterpreting of the word only to it becomes no more than modern theological terms and then there could be a misinterpretation of the other end where it becomes nothing more than just human inspiration and human enthusiasm so how is the only way you're going to know you're right is if it's in the word and he's saying that this time is now a famine for hearing the words of the lord and that they had turned from god's word to the teach false teachings and modernist the churches socializing and churches organized and tightened up and so set up they turned from the word and so they were no longer letting the word have preeminence and it made them uh the subjects of the oncoming judgment now i want to just kind of open up this path but then it says it's just about that time that god always raises up something when people get hungry for the word and they can't find it it's about that time that god raises up something now it's very clear what brother branham's identifying is malachi chapter 4 and even the opening of the word that in the chaos of what pentecost had become and the chaos that laodicea was in and there was a famine for hearing the word god raised up something which was the greatest seven course meal that we could feed on so god raises up something to satisfy those who are seeking the word of god now with that i want just to stay leave that thought there and bring out a couple things in closing brother branham writes this in chapter 4 of the church age book the two vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness towards the truvine on the part of the falls there's enough bitterness in the false vines so we don't have to be let the false find be bitter let it go lay it aside give it time go forward death was not only the seed of the false vine but even in the true vine now where did this start from turning away from god's demand right turn it turning away from god's demanded of a church absolutely dependent upon him leaving their first love so this is how he brings this out in such profound language death was not only the seat of the fall sign but even in the true vine there was a creeping paralysis so there's a disease now in the true vine this is something that's gradual a creeping process spreading in to where there's muscular function loss and it keeps getting a loss of vigor loss of movement a creeping paralysis and these are his words and impotence a lack of self-restraint a lack of control a lack of physical strength something powerless now there has been a creep in paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after pentecost having drifted away from the pure word of god having turned away from the pure word having turned away from the unadulterated truth that allowed weakness it's a crisis of faith no longer feeding on the true unadulterated true word of god no longer depending upon him turning to churches being socialized in organizations and being tightened up and set up and turning away from god's demand of a church being absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon him to fulfill his word from start to finish turning to organized human government to legislate for the people and the expediency of human government instead of the word and spirit what did it cause a creeping paralysis and impotence drifting away from the unadulterated truth and here's a phrase that i like to quote very often and make reference to it even if i'm not reading directly out of the church age book and we should all know this by heart no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of god you can't even qualify this it's set in such a way to where in context out of context is true however you want to move it around it remains the truth no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive you cannot be more strong you cannot be more healthy you cannot be more alive than your knowledge of the pure word of god and your obedience to the pure word of god so what makes you alive knowledge of the word obedience to the word what makes you spiritually healthy knowledge of the word obedience to the word what makes you strong knowledge of the word obedience to the word what's going to make you more alive more healthy and more strong more knowledge of the word more obedience to the word this is what your spiritual health is based upon this is exactly what jesus refers to he says man shall not live by bread alone this is exactly what god said the signs and wonders and the miracles were supposed to provoke within the heart of the israelites was the fact that his word was sufficient they would recognize that yes bread is good and god can provide it but the god that provides that bread is providing something greater for a greater need you cannot be any stronger any more healthy any more alive than what you know of the word and what you're obeying in the word and he says as seen by multitudes of examples in the old testament what's happening within the framework of the church organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of membership it's when you read statements like that that you realize brother level was helping him write organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of membership for holy ghost leadership was deposed and the word was replaced by creeds dogmas and man-made ritual it doesn't say replaced by cat sacrifices right and elicit drug use it's said in such a way to where holy ghost leadership can be cast aside and the word be replaced by creeds dogmas and man-made rituals it's very easy to leave out the leading of the holy spirit it's very easy to turn yourselves over to traditions and not let the word have preeminence what does this what does this mean you ask i i share these statements with you i i've traveled down this line of thought to get you to ponder how precious the word is and we say when we say i'm hungry what are you hungry for what is it we need the most in this time that we're living in we need the word more than ever before we need the pure word of god in isaiah chapter 55 this was our text i'll just read we'll read three verses i have on the slide here ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come you buy and eat well you ask those who don't have money to come but then you asked us to buy and eat ponder this yay come buy wine and milk without money and without price what is he what is he speaking to what kind of milk would it be what kind of wine would it be what kind of thirst is he talking about is he talking about someone right now i find myself right now in this season where my allergies seem a little bad and my throat's always a little bit hoarse and i'm really thirsty living in this arid climate and i'm really thirsty so i'm using that as an excuse and i preface it just well to be able to take a drink of water he's not talking about a natural thirst when a man is thirsty for that he'll find what satisfies when a man's hungry you think of the prodigal son when he was hungry he was willing to fight with pigs for corn husk in the slop when a man's that hungry and a man's that thirsty he'll search for it but god is identifying a soul thirst that only he could satisfy you that are thirsty blessed he who hungers and thirsts ye that are thirsty come to the waters come and buy wine and milk without money and without price why do you spend money wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread now take this in a spiritual sense that will come in the last days of famine not of bread nor of water but of hearing the word he says why do you exert yourself pine for support run after buy things that don't really satisfy what you need for that which is not really satisfying why do you labor for that which satisfyeth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good now how are you gonna how are you gonna eat that which is good by listening to his voice did you catch that come drink come eat how harken diligently under me and eat that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness not your taste buds not your stomach not this digestive process but your soul delight itself in factness and this verse oh i just love it incline your ear and come to me listen to what i have to say come unto me hear and your soul shall live but he says come to the waters come by wine and come by milk well who is he calling himself who is he calling you to incline your ear and come to me and your soul shall live no matter how well you take care of this body it's going to die one day if the if the lord delays the meeting in the air the longer this terror is the longer this waits the the more likely we're all going to head to the grave no matter how well you take care of this body it has death already sewn into it as a natural process so he says listen to me come unto me hear and as you hear the word of god your soul shall live brother said all life comes by the spoken word of god be no more stronger spiritual healthy or alive than how well you're hearing the word and feeding on the word think about this we won't get into it but if you're ever going to speak it you have to first eat it if you want to be speaking the word you want to be living the word even if that was the only way that we drew the picture of the third pool which it's often kind of built around this idea that we're all gonna uh just kind of be standing in this perfect choir alignment and speak things into existence if that is in fact what it's going to be is where we're all speaking the word and things are materializing you'll never be able to speak it if you're not eating it and we should be more concerned with eating it right now than speaking something we don't have all life comes by the spoken word of god brother brown preaches the rapture message he says what is the shout then it's the message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride just at the time that there's a famine he always does something john chapter 6 verse 27 labor not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life what meat is that which the son of man shall give unto you the meat that tends to endure us that promotes that grants a greater strength a greater spiritual health a great a greater spiritual spiritual vitality and alive is the meat that the son of man gives you for him hath god the father sealed why do we labor for that which satisfies not why do we spend money for that which is not bread come unto me hearken unto me listen to my word incline your ear come eat and your soul shall live eat and your soul shall delight itself in fatness the meat which endureth unto everlasting life is the meat of the son of man feed on that don't be ashamed of it feed on it hear it read it listen to it john chapter 6 they had the loaves and the fishes and they were happy and they felt the sense that they could continue in that the rest of their lives and be satisfied and had an opportunity been given to them to be able to do that i think they would have accepted it and they would have been content to live having food three square meals a day however you want to describe it they would have been happy and they would have been bragging about it and they would have been talking about it but they would have missed the whole point of it three meals a day didn't have to work anymore could use or they could use this extra money that they had now by not having to spend it on food for other things and their lives would forever change and it just seemed as if they had entered into some sort of nirvana where food is always provided for and it's always just readily available they would have accepted that and why because they would have settled for something less they would have accepted something far less valuable because their thinking had warped their perception of the value of the word that was standing before him here was christ the word now i know we we don't really i think your heart you i know your hearts are sincere even i i understand that as i'm preaching tonight some of you may be personally saying is do i really have that problem i thought i really loved the word no you love the word they do have this say that if you go to church on sunday morning you love church if you go sunday night uh you love your pastor and if you go wednesday night you love the word so welcome word lovers and uh that's why we don't have a sunday night because no one loves the pastor how's that and so for us it's hard for us maybe to put ourselves in that mindset but here was christ the word in their midst their messiah their mate and they only wanted him to make bread they only wanted him to do a miracle to perform a sign to do something in this arena in this realm and they were not sufficiently impressed with the word that was in their midst that would do something that could transcend somebody could work hard and buy bread someone could fish hard and get fish but here stood one that could do more than that yes it seemed to come at ease from his hands and multiplying bread and fish yes this is a dynamic miracle but should that not get your attention that this word that is coming forth from this man is greater than fish greater than bread because it speaks to a need that's greater in my heart should not these miracles and signs and wonders make us more sensitive to the presence of god that is here and be sufficiently impressed with the word that has been brought to us as believers not in conduct order and doctrine that has allowed us to structure our churches in a way that god will bless it not in that we're able to arrange things in in a way that satisfies the desires of god and is pleasing to the lord in terms of order and structure into governments and arrangements and offices and duties no but the word that has been brought to us none of the order it's it's not worth it coming here setting up and tearing down if the word's not preached so it's the value it's the change in value they recognize impressed were they impressed yes they were impressed but not sufficiently not enough to get past the body and how hungry it was are you hungry enough for god to where your sickness doesn't matter what matters is the contentment in your soul are you hungry enough for god to where he said though you slay me yet i'll serve you are you hungry enough for god to say lord did this headache this this stomach problem the pain i have in my ankles lord this situation that situation it matters it doesn't matter as much as your word matters to me are you hungry enough that if your soul is being fed you don't despair of life if your soul is being fed you don't doubt if your soul is being fed you say lord you give and you take away blessed be the name of the lord your word is greater your word is richer you say yes i'm hungry well you're sick but i'm hungry for the word of god well you're cast out you're this you're that but my hunger for the word of god is being satisfied and that brings my contentment it says and have i not seen sent thee brother branham says this and to see right now in this evil day look at this statement ponder this and to see right now in this evil day that we live in when unbelievers and scientists and so forth are trying to cut away the very value of the word you could just imagine it you've got the burger of the word right and you're getting ready to eat someone start telling you well do you know if there's any hormones in that is that bun gluten free was it frozen is that organic mustard do you know if they wash the lettuce how do you know those tomatoes are going to give you cans a canker sores on your lips because they're your tongue because they're too acidic you're like are you serious you know it's going to give you cancer don't you what and they just they think that you you're getting ready to take a bite out of this thing and you want to eat it and someone's able to talk you out of it now just as we've all imagined this real juicy burger what time does in and out close that's what science has tried to do to the word of god this is what the unbelievers and so forth you've got your soul forth your scientists and your unbelievers what are they trying to cut away the very value of the word to cause it to pale into comparison to what other things have we have our metrics we have our paradigms we have our value systems we have the way the way we've set things and bring things and the world is actually trying to cause us to think that the word is less than what's being offered if you could just grab a hold of this it's the word or nothing and the lord i'd rather have nothing and the word if i've got the word then i doesn't matter if i have nothing else i've got the word the word that can provide everything else and the world just warps our minds to think that it has to be a particular way it has to have a particular setting has to have this it has to have that what matters the word matters take this whole world but give me jesus you could take its money you could take its fame you could take its opportunities you could take its privileges you could take its rights it's prestige take everything but give me the word having the word i'll be content and the word is more valuable than anything else but unbelievers and scientists are trying to and so forth are trying to cut away the very value of the word don't let them do it take the bite and enjoy it do it here you are with the book you're getting ready to eat it right because that's what we do we take the book and eat it and people start telling you well you sure about that huh you sure you want to do that and we're over here yeah i am take it eat it up it's your right god bless you let's stand tonight these are just things that are a prelude to what's been in my heart can you say i'm hungry lord in my heart i'm hungry for the word it's what i want lord it's what i need let's bow our heads i'd like to pray with you i know there's different needs that we have in our lives and different needs that we may have in our families [Music] just take him at his word take him for all that you need [Music] lord [Music] let's pray together heavenly father [Music] the sweet presence that's amongst us tonight lord and we know that's you you have not graced us with your presence to only be felt and known but you came and spoke to our hearts and now lord in your presence we take you for all that we need [Music] but i know that the structuring of the word together in subject and verb and the arrangement that can be diagrammed is give me the word word only take this whole world but give me jesus lord it's words that are easily uttered from our lips but we say it tonight with faith deep down in our souls [Music] believing in its value and its worth that with this word in my faith in it [Music] what is impossible with man is possible with you and that i can take my stand on your word trust your word believe your word hold to your word feed on your word and begin to derive what i have need lord i believe that i speak to believers today [Music] and that their crisis of faith is not the evidence of a lack of election their crisis of faith is not even evidence of doubt but their crisis of faith is symptomatic of a lack of hearing the word [Music] may we then as your daughter as your son take to us more frequently this word more often to listen to read to ponder may it even be lord that we have to change our view of church we're taught that church is for the preaching of the word we realize lord there's a lot more that goes into church as many other benefits that we derive from it many other responsibilities and functions related to it than just the act action of preaching the word but lord we were taught that to understand that if you took the preaching of the word out of it church just collapses the purpose of it falls away it's remarkable lord to read in the word to understand that the word had been taken out of the church but the church continued but yet for the believer he cannot you cannot take the believer take the word from the believer he continue he must have it he has to live by it he knows when he doesn't get it he longs for it he searched for it he hunts for it and i pray today may this sermon tonight be a reminder to those elect eagles that they must be gathered around the carcass of the word that's what they're drawn to that's what they move for that's what they hunt for that's what they long for is the word [Music] that's beautiful for in this word we have everything we have need of [Music] salvation healing comfort peace the laying on of hands the manifestation of gifts lord it's all in the word we do not need to stray to the expediency of human government and modern theological terms to produce some sort of impersonation the word will bring it [Music] pray lord tonight that you would just comfort our hearts as i as the word may have been direct and firm and cutting in some ways may be received in grace lord that my takeaway tonight is i'm made to hunger for the word that my weakness my unsteadiness my frustration my shortness of temper and the the the lack of harmony within my home and the disjointed feeling i feel at work and maybe even the estrangement i feel from church folks is a lack of feeding on the word of may god do that together lord bless your people to close this service lord be with those hurting in the heart hurting body hurting in mind lord may they be comforted may they be healed bless our worship we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
