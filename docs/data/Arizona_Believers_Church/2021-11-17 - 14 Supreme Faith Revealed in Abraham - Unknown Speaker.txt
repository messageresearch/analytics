TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the um the subject again is supreme faith revealed in abraham i'm specifically looking at how that abraham's journey is connected to adam's fall and uh how the mystery of abraham's faith and his journey there's elements that are hidden in genesis chapter one one two three and four and i don't say that to kind of make the first few chapters mysterious or to add any kind of layer of mystery to abraham's life but we're just looking at how there's certain things that took place in the beginning and then when the beginning was ending and you have this uh new this chaotic order that begins to unfold and god is telling the story in chapters 5 even through 11 of mankind's wickedness judgment and then their resumed wickedness after the flood there's just things that we can look to to understand why god begins to pattern things in abraham's life and not so that we could understand the character abraham but understand how god is dealing with us to produce a rapturing faith and to to anchor ourselves in the unconditional covenant to anchor ourselves in the election of god and i wanted to back up just very quickly make reference to how the kind of the i the image of supreme faith it came to me through the scripture that says where abraham's faith was made perfect when he offered up his son isaac so supreme faith was expressed on mount moriah that the offering of isaac as a sacrifice expressed and it's a very deep deep profound deep and wide picture that expresses certain sentiments or certain things that are very rich and very profound and so there's so much to it that we could keep adding and adding and adding so i'm not wanting to belabor something or just repeat myself but i wanted to bring this image up before us again how that this offer the willingness to offer up isaac and even being asked to offer up his son as a sacrifice um brings this expression of supreme faith and it is said in genesis chapter 22 and i don't have these um scriptures for you to read i wanted to just go through them very quickly but in genesis chapter 22 verses 8 and 13 as they're going up the mountain isaac notices we're going to sacrifice and there's no sacrifice and so he inquires as to the sacrifice and abram said abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burned offering so they want went both of them together this is abraham's seemingly unwavering it's as if he already knows it he's certainly confident he says god will provide himself a lamb he's he's very confident about this and then it says in verse 13 and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and we realize that even in the meaning to jehovah jireh we see it is the lord sees but it's the lord sees and he also provides jehovah jireh he provided in that moment according to the confession of abraham who said that god will provide himself a lamb and sure enough it's exactly what happened and so he names it even after what he had spoken and confessed beforehand this place jehovah jireh because god provided and i wanted to i wanted to remind you of that because i'd like to come back to it at the end if possible and just quickly reviewing on the last few services how that god is patterning in abraham and sarah this pattern that we see in their lives he's patterning them after adam and the woman that there's things that are represented as a contrast there's also things that are represented in similarities but we see the image god achieving the image of one man and his wife all alone with the promise that's how adam and the woman were that's where abraham and sarah come after separation and so this uh this call to separate from unbelief achieved an image that we saw in genesis 3 but then it's also achieving a separation from what marred that image a separation from unbelief and so i want to continue to identify the pattern in abraham's life and and some of these things that we can see hidden and that are matching in genesis 1 to 4. and if you could i will just look at verse 10 of our text genesis chapter 13 verses 10 11 of our text and it says and as we were noting on the separation that the separation to us as brother brown emphasized it over and over again abraham separating from lot is a type of us as believers separating from unbelief and so it's not identifying human human beings necessarily that we've got to shun and have nothing to do with but rather it speaks more to at the most necessary level separating from unbelief and uh and so i want to focus still on that dynamic but look at it from another another element of it it says in verse 10 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered everywhere and then this annotation before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah so this condition was much more beautiful than it would be after the destruction and the judgment even as the garden of the lord this is a peculiar description because it's not often that the garden of the lord is mentioned but yet it's raised up in view as lot chooses this is something that would have had this image or strikingness as the like the land of egypt as thou comest out of zoar then lot chose him all the plain of jordan so this is what he chose he wants the plane the well-watered area the beautiful cities and a lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other so the separation has transpired and in this separation god is showing us the image of one man and one woman god is showing us the separation from unbelief and remember that the name lot means uh a covering uh it it it that's just it's a very simple definition it means a covering so lot and this is what we're taught in the message of the hour this is just very it's very simple tonight um so if you came studied up and you you you took that five hour energy or popped some of those pills that make you focus really really good you might be a little bit disappointed and wish you would have saved them for tomorrow because it's really really simple i think you're gonna be able to grasp this very easily because you probably already know it but lot then and we're taught this in the message represents the a formal christian the lukewarm believer so it's formal lukewarm religion and if you ponder the characteristics that brother branham identifies in lot you find he's the personification of a label to see and make believer it's like they lived back then i mean law embodies this laodicean attitude and he's the personification of the laodicean make believer and the bible says this and i want you to catch this phrase here and notice this phrase lot journeyed east so he lifts up his eyes he sees the plane of jordan he sees it's well watered and he sees it like the garden of the lord is the land of egypt and he chooses him this and it says in lot journeyed east this is a specific phrase that has tremendous meaning and by saying that lot journeyed east he's identifying lot with the religious spirit that impersonates truth it is a religious move for him it is something that is religiously justified as something that he has uh that he has a certain motive in doing but yet it's not rooted in the word and it wouldn't be like hey i like all the frivolity down there in sodom and hey this looks like it's going to be a lot of fun there when it says lot journeyed east he's being identified with the religious spirit that motivates him brother braham said in the message wisdom versus faith lot was a religious man a type of the formal church that's just a quick statement lot was a religious man a type of the formal church recognize where brother branham is identify where brother is identifying lot it says in the presence of god unrecognized there is always three classes of people in a religious gathering believers make believers and unbelievers well not this one this isn't religious gathering by no means there's always three classes of people in a religious gathering believers make believers and unbelievers the game is figure out who's which right but then it says this always them three and there they was and he's referring right into the time of abraham there is the unbelieving sodomite the make-believer lot and abraham the elected church so this is where brother brown begins to put lot in the context of the story of abraham and i'll say this even in as god has dealt with my heart i feel like i'm not even doing a real deep dive on lot this is just the surface things to look at uh um and how the brother he's placed in the word of god so we must identify that lot was very religious and his journey and east and we're just focusing on this phrase and lot journeyed east it's a representation of this carnal formal man-made religion lots journey and east this is a religious exercise this is a this is something that's motivated by religion brother ram said lot he called him the lukewarm church member in another place he said he had a form of godliness and another place he said lot was a carnal character so these are things that we begin to recognize in the character and the nature of lot and as we mentioned on sunday when we're introduced to him our introduction is strife that there's some sort of competition and and animosity between the herd men and between abraham and lot so when god looking at this just very simply when god separates abraham from lot it it represents something very distinct in abraham's life obedience to the word of god get away from your family get away from your kindred and because of what lot represents it it stands for separation from religion it stands for separation from impersonation and this is something that just kind of gets very near our hearts and something we have to be aware of because as we speak these things it's best just to internalize and look within ourselves how can i separate from unbelief how can i within myself within my thought process within the things i say and do and so when we when we if we recognize this just i know i'm just kind of throwing it out there and there's a lot of things we could use to substantiate it but god separating abraham from lot represents a separation from false religion man-made religion carnal believing make believing laodicean lukewarm condition a formal religion cold religion all those different things we can look then in genesis chapter 4 and see the image of false religion we can look in genesis chapter 4 and see this the the the the seeds of a false religion are first seen in the worship of cain in genesis chapter four which is cain is the product of what unbelief and sin in the beginning would begin with unbelief and we've i think we've read this statement uh before but uh it's i want to i want to read it again just to kind of reintroduce some of these things into evidence it says and you notice that all those cults of this day are beginning in genesis they have their starting back in genesis winding up here in the last day for instance many of them like how that formal religion being in kane now you identified the formal religion and lot now he's identif we're going back and recognizing that it's genesis was in king and then notice how he paints the kind of the trail of it how it come on out and come down through the sons of noah ham out of ham he had nimrod nimrod built the tower of babel babel comes on down through well let me just stop there for a moment as i've studied the life of abraham within the jewish tradition there's many that believe that abraham withstood nimrod and nimrod threw him into prison for 10 years one tradition as it was 10 years another one is that nimrod threatened to throw him into the fiery furnace so there's a lot of interesting traditions that revolve around abraham and his situation or his his life there in babel but here this nimrod builds a tower of babel and then he carries it babel comes on down through keem nebuchadnezzar's time and on out into revelations babylon notice he just picks it up with cain and that seed goes all the way through the babylon that that existed before abraham was called is the babylon that existed during the time of abraham's seed soul journey in israel it's the babylon that exists today the spiritual babylon in the end time it says how that little seed started way back there at the east side of the gates of eden coming on down winding out all kinds of cults and everything started back there winding themselves out to the end notice that the east side of the gate of eden it says now it behooves us to watch be careful be set in the word many things are taking place today which are unscriptural let's watch the scripture to be sure that we're all right that that is always timely watch the scripture to be sure that we're right there's many things that are taking place even today in 2021 that are not that are not scriptural and that we have to be rooted in scripture and there's even a way that people want to kind of massage the message a little bit to present a picture that is not scriptural and so if the message becomes unscriptural it's a mess not the message because the message harmonizes and dovetails with scripture somebody has massaged it and moved it and changed things of it and presented the wrong picture and so this is brother branham identifying formal religion beginning in cain at the east side of the gates of eden and so in genesis chapter four verse three and in the process of time it came to pass that king brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord now what stands out about his sacrifice well where we live today if someone said a sacrifice of fruit that wouldn't appear to be a sacrifice we think sacrifice we naturally just associate with the shedding of blood so we can immediately begin to identify with what what we know in scripture that cain's offering was bloodless we know according to scripture that by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain explicitly telling us that cain lacked revelation he did not have a revelation so it was bloodless it was without revelation and as a result of it not being by revelation he actually takes fruit from the ground it says he brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the lord and we go back in genesis 3 and what was cursed the ground was cursed and so cain is taking an offering from the ground which had been cursed and so we see that there's a lot of ways that we begin to identify how cain builds a beautiful altar and structures his his worship service in such a way that it's very engaging very inviting very pleasing and very uh very beautiful but yet it lacks revelation and that is actually coming from things that something that is cursed and so cain's worship is carnal worship it it is carnal religion it is impersonation it is not with understanding and so when he offers up the fruit of the ground his offering and i know that we've covered these things before almost exactly a year ago but his offering connects directly to the instinct of man when he sinned in the beginning remember the the religious covering that man engaged in genesis chapter 3 verse 7 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons what was that that was man's response to sin this is man's way to handle unbelief create a religion create a religious covering that we identify the message of the hour that the fig leaves were a religious covering and that was the best that mankind could do because he had no way of addressing sin himself and without revelation he had no way of addressing sin without revelation he had no way of reconciling he had no way of making things right so he began he immediately sews these fig leaves together and fig leaves so it came from a tree that had fruit they took leaves of a tree that grew from the ground that had fruit that would have been from the ground and they sowed themselves apron and cane in his knowledge maybe something that he had been taught by his parents but he didn't quite catch the revelation of goes back and takes maybe even figs from the fig tree that bore the leaves that adam and eve made aprons out of to cover their sin and this is the offering that cain gives god and so cain is his religion is a covering and it's associated with the covering that of of adam and the woman in genesis 3 7. and then and the place that he worshipped is the east side of the gate of eden so it's on the it's on the east side it holds this this allure this attraction when mankind was driven out of it and i want to read this to see how uh brother branham in different places makes reference to this and this one is very pronounced he's in question and answers on genesis he said that they said that he went to the land of nod cain was in eden eden the garden of god laid east of eden the garden of eden was in east of eden the east side of eden and the chairmans were placed and the tree of life was at the east gate of the garden and there's where i think cain and abel made their sacrifice and this is mentioned quite often in the message of the hour and there's other biblical scholars and commentators that refer to this there would have could have been an altar that was built there and there would have been this longing to to be in the garden that they'd been driven out of where these cherubim were placed so there was some geographical location that was said this is this this is east and this is facing east and this is where we're going to worship and this is what we're facing and how we want to worship and he says and there's where the cherubim with the flaming sword wouldn't let them come anymore east of the gate did you notice jesus will come from the east the light rises from the east and so there's um there's a significance and this representation of the east and it begins to have this this is where they went to worship this is this is what stands um this is where jesus is gonna come from so eyes set to the east you're looking for christ the light rises from the east you're looking for the horizon of the sun this is a symbol of east the east we know the west represents a setting sun it represents death but the east it's life it's resurrection it's jesus christ now when cain is judged and he in god has respect unto abel's sacrifice but he rejects cain's sacrifice and then cain is and then he murders his brother and then god deals with him and he's sent out he runs away it says in genesis chapter 4 verse 16 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden so now this is saying that when he's there worshiping he's worshipping at the east of eden and there's some a place that holds this attraction this alert to him but now he goes out from the presence of the lord and he dwells in the land of not not win means wandering commotion uh it's it means to be an exile so he has this it's this unrest nothing is settled uh he has no uh no roots no revelation it's a and it's a wandering it's an unrest it's a it's a commotion that's what nod means and when the bible says that he goes out to dwell in the land of nod on the east of eden it indicates once again a religious motive and it's it's him now if he was facing east what he wants to do is he wants to seemingly go further east supposing that he's going to carve out some identity he's going to establish a civilization he's going to he's going to make a name for himself and it's not going to be in rejection of god but it's going to be a further manifestation of this enlightenment of man and those that that understand god and have some continuity or harmony with this nature and so here here it says on the east of eden it's a it's religious motive that is motivating cain just as lot journeying east and so brother branham and the message power of transformation and i'm glad i'm coming to this statement because i think it'll settle some of you who are kind of trying to think and i'm a contortionist tonight brother branham says in power of transformation he says see how religious it was he reads genesis 4 16 he dwelt on the east of eden he says see how religious it was went around to the east side east side see that's that's the that's him journeying east of eden was him being religious it's a religious spirit that's on cain cain didn't run away just completely broken what have i done can i ever be restored to my family can i ever be restored to my brother he went away under religious anointing that's never quite going to recognize the of what he had done and so he's driven by religious motive he says see how religious he was he went to the east side now this i believe the scripture is intentional that when the that when the bible says that lot journeyed east and that cain went to on the east of eden it creates a symmetry and a connection between lot and the nature of cain and brother brahm does the same thing in the message the junction of time he said when abraham and lot journeyed together abraham to be heir of the world all things now he had a lukewarm backslidden church member with him i thought you'd all amen really loud about that he had a lukewarm backslidden church member with him his nephew blood relation to him okay good you guys are doing good tonight and his name was lot a lukewarm modernistic bloodless church member just a very type of today lot is a lukewarm modernistic bloodless church member in other words he does not have he does not he's not under the atonement and so we see a perfect picture even of the foolish virgin in that they had it in every age they got it today a form of godliness denying the power thereof they got it today there was lot going along right along just as religious as he could be remember those are the statements that are made of cain just as religious as he could be he was in church he did things religiously lot is just as religious as he could be but when it comes to the showdown there's spiritual understanding and then brother bam says why it even began way back when cain and abel so he's making this direct connection of the nature of abraham and nature of lot he said we see this personified again in cain and abel when cain a modern man came to the church and to the altar built a church he says cain built to church he uses that reference quite often that the building of an altar represented building church so you say well abraham never went to church he built altars everywhere he worshipped he he went to churches not that lot forms this anti-type well if lot's of religious church-going church member i don't want to go to church no abraham shows us the right way of doing it so cain was a modern man came and built a church what am i trying to say to you i'm trying to tell you my friend that just going to church and making a confession and doing good works will never save you you've got to be born again it has to come as a spiritual revelation it's there's a i think there's a way that we get so church-centric and we focus everything in on church to think that it's all about the church it's about that's what it's about well well you see we say that maybe in defense to those who don't believe in going to church but don't we believe that if you go to church without spiritual revelation you're no better off than those that stay at home this is this is something that we have to take into consideration because church isn't the salve it's not the it's not the soothing it's not the smoother uh what church becomes is a place where those who need the birth hear about it and those who've received it feed it and so it becomes like this fulcrum everything's gonna this is where things really begin to connect and make sense is the spiritual revelation of the new birth which is the baptist only goes i've got to be born again it's got to become a spiritual revelation and so that's what begins to bring the separation between abraham and lot that's what brings the separation between cain and abel in the sermon does god change his mind let me just slow down here i'm going so fast i think i can i had a couple quotes i'd taken out of my notes because i thought it would be um would be too long tonight and i realize i'm not going to be too long and i don't mind being long as long as i'm not too long but even reading these i think i might be too short so bear with me i think i'm going to read some of these quotes that i had pulled out but had at the end of my notes brother branham says this he says lot now catch how he makes this connection it's in the sermon by faith moses lord as he had to make a choice abraham give lot his choice and god gives you your choice choose you this day who you'll serve in the garden there was a tree of knowledge and a tree of life brother brahm does this in a few places where he talks about abraham and lot choosing and he relates it to the choice in the garden of eden it says man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so it is today you're given your privilege as three more agents to choose whatever you want to choose my advice to you is don't look at the modern things around you and the popularity and the glamour that you could be but choose rather by faith in him that give the promise that someday he will come and will right in all wrongs and will give you eternal life and raise you up no matter if you take the despised way with the lord's few make that choice again it's this it's this image that brother branham connects of the choice of lot to the choice that was in the garden of eden even the choice of abraham adam and the woman choosing uh to choose life choose between the tree of knowledge and the tree of life and they were to abstain from partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and they partook in it he said lot's choice was akin to adam's sin lot's choice was in harmony with the fall of the woman and it's also in harmony with the fall of cain or the sin of cain to offer religious worship he says in the message hearing receiving and acting he says now these differences have always been since cain and abel cain and abel the first human beings that produced life on earth adam and eve brought forth two one one of one kind and one of another there was cain and abel there was esau and jacob all along down the line there's always been that the two spirits warn against one another in the churches we've had plenty of it and it's always come to a place where there had to be a time of separation abraham and lot started out to find the city whose builder and maker was god lot was a carnal character and it finally come to a place that abraham and lot had to be separated before abraham could ever attain the promise they had to separate one from the other and so it is tonight you've got to separate yourself from the things of the world you've got to walk with christians i'm a great believer in christians fellowshipping with christians says you cannot walk together unless you're agreed and you agreed first with christ there's the primary part you agreed first with christ and every man agrees with christ will agree with you that the first degree with qui agree with christ he's saying there's two spirits and he lines up cain and abel jacob and esau and he recognizes these twins come even down to jesus and judas two spirits warn against one another in the churches and as he paints the picture cain and abel he brings it again to abraham and lot how they seemingly started out together searching for a city whose builder and maker is god but lot has a carnal character and because he has a carnal character god has to separate abraham from lot so that he's not confused as an heir of the promise and so that he doesn't hinder abraham from fully walking into the promise he had to bring that separation and i just want you to catch how the message of the hour identifies cain and abel and then also this image and abraham in lot and then this is this what may be the one that is the most pronounced how brother branham deals with this and the message does god change his mind he says i think that what abel had at the beginning a spiritual revelation that it wasn't fruit of the field of the works of our hands or so forth it was blood and he offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain did so this is brother branham um laying these things out abel had a spiritual revelation cain did not have a spiritual revelation then he says immediately we find in abraham this one's in there brother john if you could find it and does god change his mind he says we find in abraham and lot the same thing in a choice the same thing in abel and cain is the same thing in abraham and lot a choice which we see that he already identified it as a choice between uh uh is a adam and the woman had a choice in the garden between good and evil now there's a choice set between abel and cain and now we find abraham and lot the same thing in a choice because lot went down and when the time come when the spiritual and the natural church came in a clash because of the herdsmen when we were going through the the story of ruth and we just covered those first few chapters in the story of ruth we found that ruth was a moabite and you looked at the history of the moabites and who are the moabites they're sons of lot to the relationship lot's daughters bring forth these sons moab and you see the what is moab very formal seven altars balaam balaam worship all these things the fundamental the religious the uh so close it could deceive the elect this is what lot represents and we notice how they talked about the clash the clash coming the conflict coming with moab we see it right here already in abraham and lot it happened long before moab was on the scene it happens between abraham and lot the spiritual and the natural church clash because of the herdsmen they had to separate one from another and whenever this does it sets up a jealousy we find out abel because he god had received him and he did not receive cain's beautiful big offering he had toiled so hard for and was religious and bowed down and worshiped and done everything that abel did only he didn't have the revelation of what was the truth the the bouncing back and forth now brother brown talks about cain and abel abraham and lot abel offered by revelation cain didn't offer by revelation lot and there was jealousy with lot lot was jealous cain is jealous so we find out when god accepted abel's revelation and his offering it made cain get jealous of abel and there was the first murder we find out that jealousy become between the herdsmen of abraham and lot and they had to separate we find out that moses and cora had a clash also jesus and judas had a clash and as ever it's been the same thing and so is it today the natural church and the spiritual church have a clash when they come together do you realize your inner conflict as a believer is when the real spiritual gene begins to butt heads with the carnal gene inside of you with all the theology all the tradition all the ways of man and all the even some of the message myths that we we pick up through our through being raised in the message and things uh we've we heard a song written by a message believer and we get in our heads like it was a quote right and there's these things that loom very large in our theology that we're nothing more than i need something that rhymes i need something that rhymes oh that sounds really good and it becomes part of our message theology it's like no it was just a beautiful melody that expressed a particular thought it's not part of our doctrine and there's a lot of things that exist within our carnal minds whether it be memories and past experiences and past hurts or even expectations and ideas of the future sometimes our biggest conflicts aren't with people but with the carnal ideas that deeply reside within our psyche within our minds and our memories and our hopes and ambitions and then the spiritual gene begins to want to drive those things out and we have a clash within ourselves and god allows it to come to conflict because he wants to address that dichotomy he wants to address that the dissonance the difference that you have within yourself so he can say lot it's time to leave you've got no place in this got no place in this inheritance i've been studying a lot on on ishmael and i'm feeling that maybe we might get into the subject of ishmael here very soon as it relates to the story of abraham and you'll find that in the story of abraham abraham's life is continually separating and remember we mentioned conflict delayed is conflict multiplied in the sense that if if if abraham had never had conflict then he's going to have a multiple conflicts in the end so you recognize god puts him through conflict over and over again and he allows abraham it's very beautiful despite his mistakes abraham succeeds out of them each time he's it are you just i get kind of caught up and now caught up in the story of abraham but god tells him hey i want to take you to a place that's very very beautiful he walks him into canaan he begins to look around and see this beautiful beautiful beautiful country and he's walking around and seeing it and he's like this is where god's going to bless me next thing that happens famine wait a minute this is the place of blessing and it's a family it drives them down into egypt but god gets them out of egypt we find these over and over again these things begin to happen and what's what's happening things come up and god identifies there's a conflict and god gets abraham through it and his faith is stronger as a result of it and god just keeps he comes into conflict even in his own line god makes his faith stronger and you find there was this continual separation in the life of abraham continual separation even coming down to where after isaac is born there's still more separating that needs to take place and he separates from ishmael because this is the way that god this is the life that begins to transpire and take place in abraham's life is this separation he says and as ever it's been the same thing and so is it today the natural church and the spiritual church have a clash when they come together now the natural tries to match the spiritual always with the carnal impersonation but as it was with east on jacob it will not work i'm just letting you know right now if you're impersonating it's not gonna work for you it's not gonna work you gotta you're gonna have to get real because you're the seed of god and it's gonna have to be real impersonation won't work and thank god that he let some of our best acting performances fail like we should have got i don't know if it's a grammy emmy or what it is but should have got something for that acting an oscar that's what it is i should have got an oscar for that performance and god won't let you even get nominated because he's gonna make you fall flat on your face to recognize that's not your call in life you're the real thing and he allows conflict and allows difficulty allows struggle to expose ourselves i'm a fraud i'm pretending i'm acting this isn't the real thing and so god brings us into these conflicts brings us into these places so that we can reevaluate our lives re-evaluate our experience re-evaluate the direction we've been headed and realized oh god thank you for showing me that there's more that i can have in my experience with you instead of just letting me coast all the way on through as a really good actor it will not work it works for an esau but you're not an esau you're a jacob so whatever little bit of esau remains in us by the nature and nurture of a natural birth and going many years without a new birth that nature has got to be completely excommunicated from our thought process and isolated away from our faith so our faith can stand supreme and pure this is what is being represented in separating abraham from lot is that god is going to separate us from our religion separate us from our pretense separate us from impersonation separate us from mythologies and traditions and all the carnal lukewarm formal ways that we conduct ourselves that make us feel very good religiously but don't bring us any closer to god literally that's what the separation was about you'll find that abraham's story is a journey of separation he himself from a bloodless lifeless religion to a religion that had feeling in it religion that had life in it you say didn't have feeling that took a man in his advanced age and asked him to be circumcised tell you abraham lived a rough life the things that god asked him to do the things that were required of them i i'm kind of getting into some of the other things i've been studying that i thought that are developing maybe into some other areas but here abraham has told i give you this land and he doesn't have a place to bury his wife he's got to buy it and play an exorbitant price for it think about that this is your land abraham i give it to you but he has to overpay for a burial plot for his wife and you read abraham's testimony he never rebukes god when his wife died and said you know what you gave me this land and i don't have a place to bury or notice the character of abraham where he just kept taking it in stride and he kept believing and he kept persevering the character that is on display in abraham's life is so beautiful how abraham called out of ur no different than anyone else but by walking with god he has this disposition to be able to take hardships and difficulties and even what seems to be so against the promise to not even have a own a piece of land to bury his wife that he has to overpay to bury her that he conducted himself above it all why because his story is a journey of a lifeless carnal false cold even demonic worship of false gods to a life a religion with life in it that's the story of abraham separation from a bloodless being a bloodless church member and so as lots worship is identified in cain abraham's worship is identified in abel's revelation genesis chapter 4 it says in abel he also brought the first lings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel into his offering though it doesn't say that lot made an offering literally that was akin to the offering of cain but yet in his choosing the garden of god and choosing the well-watered plains and despite its wickedness it's in the similitude of the transgression of cain who offered fruit of the ground a beautiful altar without blood lots identified in that but now in abel's offering he takes the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering now instead of getting into whether it be the visions that abraham had and the different altars that he built and all the different sacrifices he would have made let's look at the one in general it when he offered up his son in genesis 22. the bible says that abraham offered and he's asked by god to offer up his only son in the hebrew that could have been translated to very easily only begotten son he's been asked to offer up his only begotten son and i believe the scripture is very harsh in this detail to not cause any confusion as to the place that ishmael has ishmael has his own covenant god gives him a covenant god looks out after him but god has wanted to be very specific that there's no mixing and misunderstanding as to whom the seed the promise of the seed pertains to and so when he tells abraham to go sacrifice his son he says your only begotten son isaac so that it's clear that this one has a special representation as being the seed of abraham through serra which is the only one that god recognized so abraham offers his only begotten son on mount moriah in an offering isaac as his only begotten son it follows the pattern of abel offering the firstling of his flock just as abel offered the first thing of this flock here is abraham offering his only begotten son and it's in those very moments that abraham is offering up his only son that god provides a ram for abraham and when god provides the ram for abraham and i know we went through we've gone through this story but when god provides it abraham has to go grab it he fetches it he's going to place it upon that altar he's going to cut it open to allow it to bleed he's going to offer this sacrifice upon the altar and he's going to shed the blood of this lamb upon the altar as an offering to god instead of his son what is that in the image of it's not merely just in the image of abel offering his worship in genesis chapter 4 but it's in the image of genesis chapter 3 verse 21 and the very heated moments of the sin and the judgment that followed it says unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them remember when we looked at the scripture a year ago how that in the in the way that the scripture is presented uh we know we know that it's the lord god the lord god made coats of skin and clothe them but in the original language it it doesn't suggest that god went out hunted down a lamb slayed them skinned them cured the hide and and stitched everything and sewed them together and made these skins for adam and and and the woman and put them on him but it's saying that god provided them the knowledge god gave them if i could say this way god gave them the revelation that this is what they were supposed to do and if we could take it in the sense that god god gave this commandment and caused adam to go god provided a lamb for them god provided a way for them god gave him a revelation of what it took to escape out of the garden under a promise with the covenant of redemption they were to take this lamb and slay it and dress themselves in the bleeding skims of this lamb this is the revelation that god gave adam so it would have been adam as the sinner and the participant that would have taken the lamb and slayed it according to the revelation that god gave him and then dressed himself in it and even if you say well it says brother bram said over and over again that god killed god killed the lamb but he also said god killed his son but who was it that killed him the guilty who actually put their hands upon him according to a prophecy according to prom put their hands on him and killed him it was it was his own his own brothers that did it and so that was adam's revelation in genesis 3 21 to make these coats of skins and clothing that would have been the shedding of blood that would have been the first sacrifice because of sin that's what makes abel's revelation so important because it's not merely it's it's really not just coming out of nowhere it's connected to genesis 3 21. whereas abel's offering is connected to genesis 3 7. what's the problem with that that's in the throes of guilt and fear and what do we do religious covering without revelation let's sew fig leaves together and dress ourselves but then adam's the dressing himself and the slain of the land is up by revelation and so abel picks up this revelation of what took place in the garden and he dr he kills a firstling of his flock just as would have been done as they're being driven out of the garden and that's what abraham's revelation is connected to the offering of abel and even the sac the revelation of adam and the part to me that is so beautiful in that is god said in this very these very passages in genesis 3 15 as he cursed the serpent and the seat of the woman will crush your head and this is the prophecy of jesus christ and brother brahman said that god designated genesis 3 15 to abraham and so abraham's life patterns this faithfulness to that promise where he has to back away from every unbelief he has to separate himself from anything contrary to the promise and then his life begins to act in accordance to the very first revelation that comes after the promise that it's by blood this seed of the woman is going to be a lamb his blood has to be shed the sinner has to be covered in that blood and abraham exits the garden of eden with that revelation then abel offers the same sacrifice of a lamb before god at the eastern side of eden and then abraham does the same thing with genesis 3 15 designated to him he goes upon mount moriah seemingly to offer his own son but god once again provides a lamb instead of his son we know that cain and then even in the pre-figure of lot offered the wrong sacrifice so many scriptures that we could read how able offered blood by revelation the revelation of what what took place in genesis 3. i saw mother mike if you come just close here so what god does is he takes abraham and separates him from cain's religion he takes abraham and he sets separates him from anything that's false so that he can build his faith i know i've already made reference to it i just want to close with this image in your mind the climax of climax of that faith god takes abraham and begins to separate him and mold him the climax of that faith was a sacrifice that particular sacrifice on mount moriah in the figure of genesis 3 and genesis 4 to take a lamb that god has specifically provided supernaturally god provided because what did he say my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering god provided himself even if it be god provided as a worship and an offering to himself a lamb and so he goes up to the he goes up to the the altar and god provides does he provides that lamb what is it calling back to genesis 3 15. call back to genesis 3 21 a call back to genesis 4 4 pure true worship and spirit and truth separated from carnality separated from false religion separated from politics and pretense i know i use those words a lot popularity all the things that just muddy up our worship that's what separating from lot represented is a separation from carnal lukewarm formal cold religion i say lord be it unto me according to thy word just keep purging me just keep separating me keep getting me away from all unbelief because i know my faith will grow strong as he does it that's why abraham's faith got stronger after 25 years because he kept separating from unbelief in the absence of the tangible evidence of the promise his faith grew stronger as long as he separated from unbelief he didn't need to be able to put his hands on a pregnancy test he didn't need to go in and get a physical say yep you're you're not sterile you're looking good your wife's got good eggs everything's great everything's looking good it's just a matter of time oh boy it's going to happen he didn't need any of that all he had to do is separate himself from unbelief in the absence of the manifestation his faith could still grow stronger and god can do the same thing for us because i recognize we live we live in a dry time we live we live we live in a time when the world is more pronounced than it's ever been and and its ideas and its ideologies and boys satan is so slick to take things that are purely worldly and put like just a little bit of try to put a little bit of a bible sheen on it kind of buff it and polish it up with a little mcguire scriptural wax or something and kind of gets it on there a little bit and he tries to present it to go look at this can you believe this and you're like huh and and we're we're ogling something because he's just put a coat of wax on it that makes it seem like this is something we need to be worried about like this is a scriptural this is a scriptural issue and this is a biblical problem and this is an affront to the message of the hour and you have to take a step back and realize there's so many distractions so many lots pressing for our attention so many ishmaels trying to get inside get inside the covenant there's so many things that are trying to get in our way and we need to separate more than ever before from everything that is false everything that is formal everything that is called everything that is make belief and if you could take the principle that brother branham shared with us where he says you just agree with christ first let's not get so caught up in trying to figure out all the things that we want to hate and be anti let's just get so pro christ that all the anti takes care of itself just get so caught up in faith focused on faith focus on the word all abraham had to do to get lot to separate from him is just become very very narrowly focused upon the promise and lots just begin to back away and ishmael's begin to back away as you begin to get more forward and progressive about the promise that's what we need to do just get more focused on christ more centered upon the word of god and that it just has this way of balancing things out in our life i know things are hard i know things are difficult i know that we have our eyes maybe sometimes on the horizon for something different something better but be encouraged the more you focused on christ the sooner we will we will meet that pattern we will have that meeting in the air in that eastern sky as it were there will be this this climactic ascension into the presence of god forever more and it won't be by carnal religion it will be by faith a walk of faith i know i'm repeating some of the same patterns over and over and over again but i i trust that you're praying [Music] all the time for the lord to speak to you and you have power over these next few days to get so desperate with god that he can tailor a sermon specifically for you that may not even mention abraham at all why because you call on god for it because the word is meeting your needs i know that and i'm grateful for it but it's it's upon the hunger and the desire that you have in your heart for the things of god that motivates us and moves us we love you very much we're grateful for your presence tonight he's so precious to us his fellowship with the brother last night we were just by text messaging and just a precious presence that you could have just sharing scriptures and quotes and i shared something with him and he just said all the love of god it just speaks so much of the love of god and it was what i had in my heart as i shared it but i didn't explicitly say it i said that's what's being revealed to us saves the love of god in these things let's stand tonight
