[0:01] My my title is portrait of a perfect
[0:04] man. And I'm realizing now that in my in
[0:07] looking at this I may not even get to
[0:09] the scripture in Ephesians. So let me
[0:11] just uh just read it very quickly but it
[0:14] says in Ephesians chapter 4 and that
[0:16] might be on my last slide there if you
[0:18] want to get to it but it's a portrait of
[0:19] a perfect man before we move. This is a
[0:21] painting by Karavajio and it's the uh
[0:24] road to Emmas. It's when he was called
[0:25] aside and was at in with the disciples
[0:28] and was speaking at the table. I really
[0:29] like the the style of Cardavagio, but
[0:32] he's there uh speaking. It's when did
[0:35] our hearts not burn within us when he
[0:37] spoke to us along the way? And this is
[0:38] when he broke bread and revealed
[0:40] himself. And I love the the arts that
[0:43] are able to portray um a scene where we
[0:46] can begin to think this was a very real
[0:48] thing that happened. Christ sat down
[0:50] with his disciples on the road to Emmas
[0:53] and he sat down and broke bread. And it
[0:55] was in the breaking of bread, something
[0:56] common, something that he had done
[0:57] before wherein he made himself known to
[1:00] his disciples. And I wanted to use this
[1:03] just as a an expression of this portrait
[1:07] of a perfect man because we might think
[1:08] of a perfect man as having a halo uh and
[1:11] maybe not looking very human. But this
[1:14] may be perhaps except for maybe the
[1:16] boyish face as the Cardagio used for the
[1:18] model. Uh it was a very real thing.
[1:21] would have looked like any other human
[1:22] being sitting and eating and breaking
[1:25] bread that day. But I'm looking at the
[1:26] portrait of a perfect man. This as we go
[1:29] forward in the next few services, I have
[1:30] a lot on my plate that the the portrait
[1:33] of divinity, the portrait of humanity,
[1:35] and how these things can be viewed
[1:36] separately, but yet they're combined in
[1:38] this perfect one, Christ. But it says in
[1:41] Ephesians 4:13, "Till we all come into
[1:44] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:47] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[1:48] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:51] stature of the fullness of Christ.
[1:55] He is the measure of a perfect man.
[1:58] Christ is the perfect man." There is the
[2:00] stature of a perfect man then that God
[2:03] is wanting to bring forth in us. And in
[2:05] Ephesians 4, it's saying that God has
[2:07] given gifts. these gifted men to be able
[2:09] to bring us to this image, this measure,
[2:12] and the stature of a perfect man. So,
[2:13] I'm looking at the portrait of a perfect
[2:15] man. And in particular, how I've been
[2:19] approaching is the image of Jesus Christ
[2:21] as portrayed by scripture. because we
[2:25] have not seen him. Nor should we just
[2:28] assume that the picture that Cardagio
[2:30] painted is what Jesus looked like or
[2:32] what that scene looked like because he's
[2:35] just painting what he the impression
[2:37] maybe even though it's a different
[2:38] period. It's not impressionism. But then
[2:40] that Baroque period he's painting it in
[2:42] a style as he has interpreted or it's
[2:46] been inspired to him from the story of
[2:48] the road to Emmas. And so the portrait
[2:52] or a portrait of a perfect man is
[2:54] painted in the scripture that that's the
[2:58] art that's going to convey to us who
[3:00] Jesus Christ was. In the book by Frank
[3:02] Bristol is 1897. I know you've all
[3:05] probably read it a couple times,
[3:06] listened to the audio book, but it's
[3:07] called the ministry of art. Makes a lot
[3:10] of tremendous statements in this book.
[3:12] It's a a very fascinating read in terms
[3:14] of the time period that it comes. This
[3:16] is before multimedia and picture shows
[3:19] and and all these different
[3:20] advancements. And he was looking at how
[3:23] art how used it how religion has used
[3:27] art.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; And it says art has glorified
[3:30] Christianity. It has set forth her
[3:33] doctrines portrayed her saints and even
[3:35] her very God and savior. He makes the
[3:38] phrase that it's been a teacher of
[3:40] divine things. So that's what art does.
[3:43] It it has been something that's conveyed
[3:45] to us Christ. It has portrayed instances
[3:48] in the scripture of whether it be uh
[3:50] parables or actually uh events in the
[3:53] lives of the saints. It is we have art
[3:56] has taken uh the truth and put it in
[4:00] pictures just as that road to scene that
[4:03] supper there portrayed. And because of
[4:06] that I'd like to begin to look at it
[4:08] this way. I'm just going to uh try to
[4:10] take my time today. Not be lengthy, but
[4:12] just slow down because whatever I don't
[4:14] get to today, I'll have ample
[4:15] opportunity to get to uh this afternoon
[4:19] or whatever I get don't get to this
[4:20] morning, I have ample opportunity to get
[4:22] to in a future service. But art has
[4:24] tremendous power to influence our
[4:28] understanding.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; So that when we when we look at art and
[4:31] sometimes this happens just with songs,
[4:33] there's things that we sing or things
[4:35] that we believe and like where is that
[4:37] scripture in the Bible? and we go to try
[4:38] to find it and it's not a scripture in
[4:40] the Bible. It's it's you know Tidwell
[4:42] wrote that, right? And like oh so maybe
[4:44] we don't speed up and they slow down but
[4:47] and it it's not in the Bible but it's
[4:48] just something that someone had taken
[4:50] from the word of God and use some
[4:52] artistic license uh to paint a picture
[4:55] or to use a phrase. And so sometimes we
[4:58] hold beliefs because of how art has
[5:02] informed us,
[5:03] &gt;&gt; his power to influence our understanding
[5:05] and therefore it has power to influence
[5:06] our faith or our belief. And therefore
[5:09] it has been concluded and I believe I'm
[5:11] not saying this in any way that would be
[5:13] a a surprise but art has been able to
[5:16] shape culture
[5:18] &gt;&gt; that if and this is how even uh
[5:21] representations of gods and things
[5:23] portrayed and and that's even how Greek
[5:25] mythology it was more pervasive than
[5:27] just being an oral story but they
[5:29] actually used images and they painted
[5:31] these pictures or told these stories in
[5:34] a way that it impacts belief. Right.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; And so this the the moral and visual
[5:40] power of art embeds itself in our minds.
[5:44] And I want to make a I'm wanting to make
[5:46] a a a very important spiritual point by
[5:50] these things because they have found
[5:52] that art the visual art sometimes
[5:56] embed itself or influence us more
[5:57] powerfully than the written or spoken
[5:59] language. that that image, the scene of
[6:02] it, uh, puts something in our minds and
[6:04] that's how the way we imagine it that it
[6:06] is. I want to show you a picture. This
[6:09] is Warner Salman's head of Christ. I
[6:11] think you've probably seen this one
[6:12] before. Did I put that in there, Brother
[6:15] Mitch? Okay, good. Yeah, I I I changed
[6:18] my SL I taken a whole bunch of slides
[6:19] out. I was like, I'm going to do this
[6:21] another time, then I put it all back in.
[6:22] But who's seen this picture before?
[6:26] &gt;&gt; This is a very very famous called the
[6:28] head of Christ. painted in 1940. It's a
[6:31] gentle uh Jesus with blue eyes turned
[6:35] heavenward with dark blonde hair. And
[6:39] all of us uh wasp, white, white
[6:42] Anglo-Saxon Protestants say that's what
[6:46] Jesus looks like, of course. But it this
[6:51] picture is the most reproduced religious
[6:54] work of art. It has been printed
[6:56] reproduced over a billion times. The
[6:58] statistic I found was from 15 18 years
[7:00] ago or so and it had been printed over a
[7:02] billion times then. It is as New York
[7:04] Times said the best known American
[7:07] artist and the best known American piece
[7:10] of art of the 20th century. Even though
[7:12] we might not know who the artist is,
[7:15] this is one of the most recognizable
[7:17] symbols. The artist himself said in
[7:19] painting this picture that he wanted to
[7:21] create a very familiar fe similar
[7:24] feeling to an image of a school or
[7:26] professional photo. This is the uh uh
[7:30] what do I what do I always call it? Um
[7:33] where is it we went David to go get our
[7:35] pictures? Olan Mills. That's what
[7:38] I always joke about Olan Mills. And not
[7:40] to trigger everyone about family picture
[7:41] time, but this is creating that head
[7:44] shot, this image of a school or
[7:46] professional photo of the time, the
[7:48] 1940s in making it more accessible and
[7:51] familiar to the audience. Now, what
[7:54] strikes me is that sounds a lot like
[7:55] modern day Christianity. We want to make
[7:58] the word of God more familiar. You know,
[8:00] let's preach a whole series on Christ in
[8:03] Tron, right? or we're going to be doing
[8:05] a series next year on the return of the
[8:07] king and we're going to use it through
[8:08] Tolken and we're going to tell the story
[8:10] of the second coming by using hobbits
[8:12] and so there's a way that people want to
[8:14] make the gospel more accessible or
[8:16] familiar to the audience and this is
[8:17] what he is saying he's trying to do but
[8:20] what happened IS IT CROWDED OUT ALL
[8:22] OTHER depictions of Jesus
[8:24] &gt;&gt; so that for many people in this 20th
[8:27] century 21st century that when they
[8:28] thought of Jesus Christ he was a white
[8:30] man
[8:32] &gt;&gt; and that's how they this is how they
[8:34] pictured Christ being when in fact the
[8:36] earliest images they have of Jesus uh
[8:39] often painted him with dark skin.
[8:41] Sometimes he appeared to be more African
[8:42] than Caucasian. And there's a there's a
[8:45] way that Christ now shifted from being
[8:48] actually a Jew who would have had
[8:51] different tone of skin, a different
[8:53] color of hair, a different look than
[8:55] what we pictured to be a white a white
[8:57] man, Caucasian, somewhere very similar.
[9:00] Like that guy can relate to me, right? I
[9:03] can relate to that guy except for maybe
[9:04] the hair. Uh but he's got a little bit
[9:07] more of some receding hairline there. I
[9:09] appreciate that. A little bit of nod to
[9:11] uh the plight of the white man. And so,
[9:13] but there's something relatable and
[9:14] there's vast literature on how much this
[9:17] impacted African-American Christians
[9:20] because it so embedded itself in their
[9:22] minds to believe that Jesus Christ was
[9:25] in fact a a Caucasian. This is how he
[9:28] appeared. Now you begin to combine that
[9:30] with the atrocities and the horrors that
[9:33] white men have perpetuated on the
[9:35] Indians, right? The white man, he's the
[9:38] renegade. And how the church in the
[9:40] image of of Western European had had
[9:45] gone on crusades and told people of
[9:47] other races and colors and tongues that
[9:49] either accept our religion or you die.
[9:52] Right?
[9:53] &gt;&gt; And so there is an association then of
[9:56] well if if this is Jesus is this really
[9:59] what I want.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; But I say it so that you can begin to
[10:02] think about how art influences belief.
[10:06] But not only is art used to influence
[10:08] belief, but art also is used to reflect
[10:11] belief.
[10:13] Just as much as it has power to shape
[10:15] cultural values, it can instead be used
[10:17] to mirror cultural values. where one
[10:20] would paint a picture or tell stories
[10:22] and they're they're not trying to change
[10:24] or shape culture to make it differently,
[10:25] but they're doing it to reinforce it.
[10:27] But Travis, that's how storytelling
[10:29] would work in certain cultures is you're
[10:31] trying to reinforce what you believe,
[10:32] not change morality or change a
[10:34] particular image. You're wanting to
[10:36] preserve it. And so you do it through
[10:37] art. And so art then in that case is
[10:40] supposed to reflect
[10:43] uh uh uh reflect something that is very
[10:45] real. So let me say it this way as we
[10:48] try to go a little bit further in this.
[10:51] A true portrait of Christ must mirror
[10:54] truth,
[10:56] &gt;&gt; must reflect reality, not try to change
[10:58] it.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; Where none of us would necessarily need
[11:02] to engage in some sort of balancing of
[11:04] the scales to try to produce a a Jesus
[11:07] that was is so vastly different
[11:09] ethnically to where he looks different
[11:11] than the white Jesus. came across some
[11:13] stunning portraits where Jesus is
[11:15] painted as a Mouy warrior and and I'm
[11:18] not necessarily put off by it with all
[11:19] the tattoos and the adornments, but I
[11:22] appreciated the fact that someone's
[11:23] trying to CONVEY WHAT CHRIST WOULD have
[11:26] looked like HAD HE COME AS A Maly
[11:29] &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ came born of a of a
[11:32] woman. We know he born of virgin birth,
[11:33] but he was born AND HE WAS RAISED BY
[11:36] Jewish parents,
[11:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[11:38] &gt;&gt; He would have not looked foreign. and he
[11:39] would have looked like any OTHER UH SON
[11:41] OF JOSEPH PERHAPS.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; And so there's a way that
[11:47] we in order we don't try to
[11:50] uh do some sort of
[11:53] reparations by presenting a gospel that
[11:56] balances out what's been perverted but
[11:58] rather we just want the truth of it.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think today we become more
[12:03] uh reactive in terms of our beliefs or
[12:05] reactive in terms of Christianity. uh
[12:07] there's this ground swell of opposition
[12:09] against a move a particular way. And so
[12:12] since all these things are being
[12:13] promoted and all these things are being
[12:15] put up uh in images and certain things
[12:17] are being lauded then there's a response
[12:19] to that to kick against it and try to
[12:21] paint a picture of Christ that opposes
[12:24] that and in doing so goes too far this
[12:27] way. So then what's the next swing to
[12:30] try to paint a picture of Christ that
[12:32] goes the other way. So now you have a
[12:34] transgender Jesus
[12:37] &gt;&gt; who's welcoming, who's open, who
[12:39] understands and can relate and because
[12:41] they're trying to push back against
[12:42] maybe the hate that created a false
[12:45] Jesus. [clears throat]
[12:46] &gt;&gt; But a portrait of Christ must present
[12:50] the reality of Christ.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; So now John 5:37,
[12:56] we're making excellent time. We will be
[12:58] super early to the youth dinner. I
[13:00] haven't even got to my first scripture.
[13:03] It says, "In the father," John 5:37,
[13:05] "and the Father himself, which hath sent
[13:06] me, hath borne witness of me." Think of
[13:10] this phrase, "You have neither heard his
[13:11] voice at any time nor seen his shape."
[13:16] If I could say it this way, God
[13:19] cannot be seen by natural senses.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Now, when we look at nature, we God
[13:24] makes himself known or is making himself
[13:26] known as the Bible says. All the visible
[13:28] things around us declare the handiwork
[13:30] of God. But yet when you've seen a tree,
[13:32] you have not seen God because therefore
[13:35] because we do not worship the tree. We
[13:37] do not worship the sun. Though there
[13:39] have been many cultures that have been
[13:41] impressed by the greatness of these
[13:43] elements,
[13:45] but yet they have replaced them as God
[13:47] himself.
[13:48] But God cannot be seen by natural uh
[13:51] senses. Therefore, God cannot be
[13:54] painted.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; You're listening to this? God cannot be
[13:57] painted. He can't be seen with the eye.
[13:59] Therefore, he cannot be painted. In
[14:02] Exodus 30 33:20, he said to Moses, "Thou
[14:06] cannot cannot see my face, for there
[14:09] shall no man see me and live." There's
[14:12] God in his beginning in his original
[14:15] form was alone with nothing else. We
[14:19] understand darkness as the absence of
[14:21] light. There we understand things by
[14:24] contrast. There was nothing to contrast
[14:25] God or give him any existence. We exist
[14:28] within time and space. And then we begin
[14:30] to articulate our existence within that
[14:33] by using language. But none of those
[14:35] things pertain to God whatsoever. He
[14:37] just was. I am the I am. And this God uh
[14:41] could not be seen. He says you cannot
[14:44] see my face. There's he he's saying
[14:46] there's something about even uh uh uh me
[14:49] that you cannot see, but I he creates a
[14:51] scenario where Moses is going to see his
[14:52] backside. So he's going to place himself
[14:54] in a form where his effect or his image
[14:57] can be seen but yet not his face just
[15:00] something that God has done.
[15:03] John chapter 14 6 to9 or 7 to9 if we'll
[15:06] just start there he says if you had
[15:08] known me you should have known my father
[15:10] also and from henceforth you know him
[15:12] and have seen him. So now we have this
[15:14] shift where God who could not be looked
[15:16] at in his face or you die. And then
[15:18] David in Psalms 27 you said seek my face
[15:21] your face will I seek. So, one thing
[15:22] have I desired is to behold that face.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; If anything, we could say that God was
[15:27] saying, "Seek the Messiah." And David
[15:29] said, "I want to behold the Messiah."
[15:31] Because now the Messiah is saying, "You
[15:33] have not seen God at any time. You've
[15:35] not known him." But you now have known
[15:38] him and see him. Why? Because there he
[15:41] stood in this representation,
[15:45] in this form, God in flesh, the word
[15:47] made flesh, and his son Jesus Christ.
[15:50] Philip really picking up on it says,
[15:51] "Lord, show us the Father and it will
[15:53] suffice us." There was this true
[15:55] understanding then that what Christ was
[15:57] impressing upon them was this reality of
[15:59] being able to see God.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; A Jew perhaps would not have said, "Let
[16:03] me look into the face of God unless they
[16:04] had an unal alive wish." But here he's
[16:08] saying, "Then let me see." And Jesus
[16:10] said, "Have I been so long with you?
[16:12] Have perhaps my human traits
[16:15] uh have I become so common that the
[16:18] supernatural God that's being revealed
[16:19] to my flesh, it has not impressed itself
[16:22] on you? Have I been so long with you
[16:23] that you have and yet hast thou not
[16:26] known me? Have I become familiar to you?
[16:28] Do you have you not seen what's being
[16:30] expressed, Philillip? He that hath seen
[16:33] me hath seen the father.
[16:37] And how sayest thou then show us the
[16:39] father?
[16:40] I know there's somewhat of a paradox. I
[16:43] think some of these paradoxes can be
[16:44] resolved in scripture and some of them
[16:46] will be resolved perhaps ultimately in
[16:48] that place of perfect understanding
[16:50] beyond this life. But Jesus is saying I
[16:54] when you've seen me,
[16:56] you have seen God.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; And and yet the principle and the truth
[17:01] remains that God in his original form
[17:04] cannot be seen. Yeah.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; So, if I could put IT THIS WAY, GOD
[17:07] CANNOT be painted, but his manifestation
[17:09] can be painted.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; How can God be described?
[17:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; HE'S WITHOUT END.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; HE FILLS ALL TIME AND SPACE.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; If we with ink the ocean fill uh a and
[17:23] every man ascribed by trade and EVERY
[17:24] STOCK ON EARTH AQUILL. THE WRITER SAID,
[17:26] "TO WRITE THE LOVE OF GOD ABOVE WOULD
[17:28] DRAIN THE OCEAN DRY." WHY IS IT that you
[17:31] could not write the love of God? Because
[17:33] God is love.
[17:36] There is he he cannot be described but
[17:39] when love is manifested
[17:43] &gt;&gt; when God is manifested
[17:45] &gt;&gt; that can be painted.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; The ways that he allows himself to be
[17:50] made known that can be described in
[17:52] Psalms 103:7. He made known his ways
[17:55] unto Moses. And what did Moses do? He
[17:58] wrote them down.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; He took an image of what he saw in
[18:01] heaven and he built a tabernacle on
[18:02] earth. As God manifested himself, Moses
[18:04] could write his acts unto the children
[18:06] of Israel. What happened? The prophets
[18:08] could describe the prophets could
[18:10] transcribe.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; None of them having seen God face to
[18:13] face could yet still describe the mighty
[18:15] works of God because he makes known when
[18:18] God makes himself known. Now you can you
[18:20] can write that you can describe that.
[18:24] Now, Matthewap 11:2, this was our text.
[18:28] And if you could um just stay very
[18:30] focused and if if my if my congestion is
[18:35] a little bit annoying, just look past
[18:37] that. Um if if it's cold, if it's hot,
[18:40] if you're uncomfortable, if you've got a
[18:41] crockpot that you started too early
[18:43] today, just forget about all that.
[18:45] Really important to focus because the
[18:47] point I've just made is the point I'm
[18:48] making, but I think it needs to be
[18:51] really emphasized because we want to
[18:53] know God.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; We want to know him. We want to know him
[18:56] as he is. And we want to we want to
[18:59] accurately portray him
[19:02] &gt;&gt; in Matthew chap 11 verse 25 and we'll
[19:04] read to verse 26 but then we'll keep
[19:06] going all the way to verse 30 I believe
[19:08] eventually we'll read to verse 27 and
[19:10] here it says in that time Jesus answered
[19:12] and said I thank thee oh father lord of
[19:13] heaven and earth because thou hast hid
[19:15] these things from the wise and prudent
[19:18] and hast revealed them unto babes even
[19:21] so father for it seemed good in thy
[19:23] sight.
[19:25] Now, if you were to back up and start
[19:29] with the beginning of this chapter when
[19:32] he is questioned by um or John's
[19:35] questions for Jesus and they're
[19:36] presented to Jesus, what Jesus says that
[19:39] you have hid these things and revealed
[19:42] these things, he's speaking of the
[19:44] Messiah, which Christ was,
[19:47] &gt;&gt; and the forerunner, which John was,
[19:50] &gt;&gt; and the works that that Messiah was
[19:52] doing. So he says, "You've hid these
[19:55] things, the Messiah, his forerunner, and
[19:59] the works that the Messiah did." Maybe
[20:00] we could describe it this way. You've
[20:02] hid the truth of who the forerunner was
[20:05] and the truth of who the Messiah was and
[20:07] the works that he's doing, but you have
[20:11] not only hid them from one class of
[20:13] people, but you revealed them unto
[20:15] another, babes. So it speaks of some
[20:17] sort of different kind of quickening,
[20:19] even a newness who are then able to
[20:22] learn to be taught. That's so you can't
[20:25] teach an old dog new tricks. That's kind
[20:28] of the idea here. I would say putting
[20:30] that in modern language, but that's
[20:32] probably not modern anymore. I don't
[20:33] know what would be a modern way of
[20:36] saying that. Uh
[20:39] I'm not even going to try.
[20:42] You can't six seven a skip-doo or
[20:45] whatever it is, right? Is it does that
[20:46] help? AND THEREFORE YOU THERE'S
[20:49] something to be said about when one is
[20:52] set in their ways,
[20:54] there is a an inability to learn or an
[20:57] unwillingness to learn. But he's saying
[20:59] you've revealed this to those who are
[21:01] willing to learn
[21:02] &gt;&gt; and who need to learn.
[21:05] Now God then is either hidden
[21:08] [clears throat] and I would say both.
[21:09] He's either hidden or revealed through
[21:11] the ways that he manifest himself.
[21:14] So that the manifestation you've hid
[21:16] these things from the wise and prudent.
[21:17] So God manifests himself and the wise
[21:19] and prudent are saying that cannot be
[21:21] God. But then there's this babe over
[21:23] there that sees him in the very same
[21:25] thing. So he reveals himself or hides
[21:28] himself in the very simple ways that he
[21:30] manifests himself. God's power is made
[21:33] known. His glory is made known. His
[21:34] glory is expressed. His power is
[21:36] expressed. And sometimes it's in the
[21:38] most mundane things. Sometimes it's in
[21:39] the most difficult things you have to go
[21:41] through, but God reveals himself in
[21:43] that. Fellowshipping with some families
[21:45] and some people even as of late who've
[21:47] gone through some very difficult things,
[21:49] but then they're able to look at what
[21:50] God did just uh months before THEM LIKE,
[21:53] "WOW, THAT'S GOD."
[21:55] &gt;&gt; But then somebody else could look at
[21:56] that and say, "Well, THEN WHY DID GOD
[21:58] LET THIS HAPPEN IF he knew this was
[21:59] going to happen?" And God has done
[22:01] something
[22:02] and in it he reveals himself. Yeah.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; So God makes himself known to those he's
[22:08] ordained to see him
[22:10] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't just say, "Well, it's
[22:12] kind of indiscriminate. It just kind of
[22:13] happens." He says, "As it seemed good in
[22:15] his sight,
[22:17] &gt;&gt; as it pleased you, as what your will
[22:19] was." And and I believe we have to
[22:21] accept this as Christians as hard as it
[22:23] may be. But God chooses some
[22:25] &gt;&gt; and there's others who are not chosen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, God by fornowledge does
[22:29] that." We can accept that. There's ways
[22:32] that we try to begin to understand
[22:33] exactly why God would love uh Jacob but
[22:35] hate Esau.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; A and but so we see then that God by his
[22:40] fornowledge, by his omniscience, by his
[22:42] power has chosen some but others are
[22:45] condemned who are forained the Bible
[22:47] says to condemnation, good in thy sight,
[22:50] elect according to the will of God. So
[22:53] God, you've hid some things from some
[22:55] people, but in in the manifestation, but
[22:58] the same thing that these things, the
[23:00] manifestation of the Messiah, the
[23:01] forerunner of the works, the acts, and
[23:03] all these things that work together,
[23:04] you've revealed them to others. So Jesus
[23:07] says, "All things, verse 27, are
[23:08] delivered unto me of my father, and no
[23:10] man knoweth the son." These these these
[23:13] phrases here to me are outstanding. No
[23:15] man knows the son but the father. So
[23:17] let's now we have two two entities. You
[23:20] have Jesus Christ, the son, and you have
[23:22] God. And nobody knows Jesus Christ but
[23:26] God.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "And no man knows the
[23:29] father but the son."
[23:32] &gt;&gt; So no man knows God but the son. So
[23:34] there's two entities that are only known
[23:36] to each other in nobody else knows him.
[23:40] So neither knoweth any man the father
[23:41] save the son. And he to whomsoever the
[23:44] son will reveal him. When you have seen
[23:47] me, you've seen the father. When you
[23:49] have known the son, you now know the
[23:52] father. You know God. Now this is not in
[23:54] a Pentecostal oneness representation of
[23:57] the godhead. Nor is this three gods.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; But this is the son Jesus Christ who
[24:04] reveals him. Only God fully knows the
[24:07] son. Only the son fully knows the
[24:09] father. I say that because creation
[24:11] itself declares that there is a god. The
[24:14] son was standing there. People say, "Oh,
[24:16] Jesus. Jesus and Nazareth. I know him.
[24:17] The son of Mary. Yes, I know him. But
[24:19] what he's saying is in terms of seeing
[24:21] him who he is, knowing this knowing and
[24:24] recognizing, he's saying God only knows
[24:26] the son and only the son knows the
[24:27] father. But then that God, the father
[24:30] can only be known through the son.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ alone, the son of God
[24:39] reveals God.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Th this is where we see the
[24:44] beauty of the prophecy of the Old
[24:46] Testament where God in measure is handed
[24:48] out and we can see God in David. We can
[24:50] see God in the prophets. We can see God
[24:51] in Elijah. There's ways that we see
[24:53] these glimpses of God. But the
[24:55] foreshadowing of the Old Testament is
[24:56] that one day God would come in flesh and
[24:59] in him
[25:00] &gt;&gt; was the seed of Genesis 3:15. And in him
[25:04] is the seed of Abraham, not Isaac. and
[25:07] that in him all nations of the earth
[25:09] would be blessed because now he becomes
[25:11] the expression of God in the only way to
[25:14] be saved and the only path of
[25:16] redemption.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ alone reveals God. Yes.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; In second Corinthians chapter 4:4. And
[25:23] whom the god of this world and think of
[25:24] this beautiful uh symmetry of this
[25:27] layering. The god of this world, Satan
[25:29] has blinded the minds. Remember this.
[25:31] Maybe just put a little star and uh
[25:33] start a timer because we're going to
[25:34] come back to this. Says has blinded the
[25:36] minds of them which believe not. God
[25:38] hath hid these things from the wise and
[25:40] prudent. So there's a group that's
[25:41] blinded. Blinded the minds of them which
[25:43] believe not. lest the light. Think of
[25:45] all these things we've been ministering
[25:46] on this aspect of light of the glorious
[25:48] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[25:52] should shine unto them.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[25:56] &gt;&gt; God is revealed in the face of Jesus
[25:58] Christ.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; That's his brilliance.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; That's his light. That's who he is. It's
[26:03] his glory. It's his beauty. And then
[26:05] when someone looks into that face and
[26:08] doesn't see God, it's because their
[26:09] minds are blinded
[26:11] &gt;&gt; because Christ is the image of God. In
[26:13] Colossians chapter 1 12 uh we'll go to
[26:16] verse 15. Given thanks unto the father
[26:18] which hath made us meat and made us
[26:21] worthy or uh heirs appropriate made us
[26:25] meat to be partakers of the inheritance
[26:27] of the saints in light who hath
[26:30] delivered us from the power of darkness
[26:33] and translated us into the kingdom of
[26:36] his dear son
[26:39] in whom we have redemption through his
[26:41] blood. Whereas it says in 2 Corinthians
[26:43] 4, in whom the God of this world has
[26:45] blinded them from Christ, who is the
[26:47] image of God. Now in Christ, in whom we
[26:50] have redemption through his blood, even
[26:52] the forgiveness of sins. Who is this?
[26:54] His son Jesus Christ. Verse 15, who is
[26:57] the image of the invisible God.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; This is why no man has seen God at any
[27:02] time. God is in his essence essentially
[27:06] invisible.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Until he makes himself known in some way
[27:10] that our senses can acknowledge him or
[27:13] our spiritual senses can see him.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; I'm kind of getting ahead of myself a
[27:17] little bit there, but he is in the image
[27:19] of the invisible God, the firstborn of
[27:20] every creature. If I could uh place it
[27:23] in these terms, the image
[27:26] and likeness of God. I I'm working on a
[27:29] youth sermon and it has to be in the
[27:30] United States on NIL
[27:33] name, image, and likeness.
[27:36] And and and that's all the rage in
[27:38] college sports anymore. And it's just a
[27:40] cheap knockoff of how that Jesus Christ
[27:42] is in the name, image, and likeness of
[27:44] God. And we all want to participate in
[27:46] that deal.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; But Christ who is in the image of God
[27:52] came in his father's name. in the
[27:53] likeness of God. It was this image and
[27:55] likeness of God is depicted by Jesus
[27:58] Christ. We have not seen God. But now
[28:01] here is one who is representing him.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[28:04] &gt;&gt; THAT HIS JOB as he said was to declare
[28:06] the father. It's not just to SAY JES OR
[28:08] GOD GOD FATHER BUT ACTUALLY TO UNFOLD AS
[28:11] a narrative. In other words, Jesus's
[28:13] life can be prod seen as a one-man drama
[28:17] &gt;&gt; a as a a LIFE OF TELLING A STORY that
[28:20] presents the heart of God.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; And it is I'm moving very I want to say
[28:27] uh in a linear way today that we're
[28:30] moving we're kind of moving along this
[28:32] path and as he lived this maybe I could
[28:35] just take a step back. God cannot be
[28:37] seen, but his works and manifestations
[28:39] manifestations were. But now when he
[28:42] sends the Messiah, he is saying, "Now
[28:44] you see me.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; I've made known myself through prophets.
[28:48] I've made known myself through prophecy.
[28:50] I've I I've caused HELL TO FALL OUT OF
[28:53] THE sky that destroyed an army. I've
[28:55] I've caused the dead to be raised. I
[28:57] I've declared myself to be the one true
[28:59] God. I've identified myself with Israel.
[29:01] But now I'm in my son.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; And my son is now on earth in flesh. And
[29:07] not just to redeem and vindicate what
[29:10] Jews believed, but to be revealed to all
[29:13] flesh.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; To be a savior of the world.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; And now that Christ is on earth living
[29:22] and the disciples are witnesses to it.
[29:24] Therefore, this image was witnessed by
[29:27] the disciples.
[29:29] Luke 1:es 1:4. For as much as many have
[29:32] taken in hand to set forth in order a
[29:34] declaration of those things which were
[29:36] most likely surely believed among us.
[29:38] Now we know why the Declaration of
[29:40] Independence is written this way. Those
[29:42] men read the Bible.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; They're sounding much like Luke does
[29:46] here when he says it as much as taken in
[29:49] hand to set forth in order a declaration
[29:51] of those things which are most surely
[29:53] believed among us. These truths we
[29:55] believe to be self-evident
[29:57] &gt;&gt; even as they delivered them unto us
[29:59] which from the beginning were
[30:00] eyewitnesses.
[30:02] Is he saying that we're going to make a
[30:04] declaration of those things which are
[30:05] believed that the things that we believe
[30:07] are to be true. Those things which were
[30:10] delivered by those who witnessed
[30:13] Christ and were ministers of Christ. If
[30:16] I could put it in those terms,
[30:17] eyewitnesses and ministers of the word.
[30:19] It seemed good to me also knowing that
[30:21] there have been other witnesses who've
[30:24] seen it and then portrayed it through
[30:26] verse through writing seemed good to me
[30:29] also having a having had perfect
[30:31] understanding of all things from the
[30:32] very first. Now he's not saying perfect
[30:33] understanding of all things since in the
[30:35] beginning God but from the beginning of
[30:38] the ministry of Jesus Christ to write
[30:40] unto thee in order that thou mightest
[30:42] know. So he says that the most excellent
[30:45] Theophilles, I think someone should name
[30:47] their son most excellent Theophilus
[30:51] Sanchez.
[30:54] Most excellent Theophilles. And he says
[30:57] um that thou mightest know the certainty
[31:00] of those things which thou hast been
[31:02] instructed wherein thou hast been
[31:04] instructed. So there's teachings of
[31:06] Jesus Christ. We are eyewitnesses of his
[31:08] majesty. Peter said, "We've written
[31:10] these things. We've told you these
[31:11] things. WE CANNOT TAKE YOU BACK to see
[31:14] him and witness these events. We cannot
[31:17] we it's not video recorded to where now
[31:20] you would watch it and you would see
[31:21] Jesus multiply bread and fish. We saw it
[31:24] with our own eyes. So now we become the
[31:26] vessel, the artist that's trying to
[31:28] paint this picture accurately of what he
[31:29] did.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; To me, it's amazing that we've come to a
[31:32] place now where we cannot even rely upon
[31:38] &gt;&gt; hope I'm not getting ahead of myself.
[31:39] what we see and what we hear because now
[31:41] all of us always say that's AI.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Hey
[31:46] &gt;&gt; son, did I just see you do that and when
[31:48] you were told not to do it? AI daddy
[31:52] wouldn't me.
[31:55] And there's so many ways now that people
[31:56] are manipulating understanding and
[31:58] perception anymore. You think you've
[32:00] watched the news, you haven't watched
[32:02] the news.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; It's fake.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Trump was a prophet. Fake news, right?
[32:08] And now it is literally fake news.
[32:11] Trump was not a prophet. Uh just make
[32:14] that clear. Not in my opinion.
[32:19] But there was a represent Christ is
[32:22] living this out. And now as it was
[32:23] witnessed by the disciples, they had to
[32:25] somehow convey what they saw because we
[32:27] do not have the benefit of being able to
[32:28] go back and see it ourselves. Right.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; So if I could say this and try to do so
[32:34] in a way that kind of summarizes this
[32:36] thought is the portrait of Christ is the
[32:39] impression
[32:42] for us. The portrait of Christ is in
[32:45] part the impression
[32:47] inspired by the four gospels.
[32:50] How else would we know him?
[32:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; How else do we know what he said except
[32:56] through the four gospels? How else do we
[32:58] know how he lived what he taught
[33:01] &gt;&gt; except through the word of God?
[33:04] &gt;&gt; So there is a picture painted by the
[33:07] gospels that become this impression upon
[33:12] us.
[33:14] Now let's look at our text again
[33:17] and we'll start with verse 25 and we'll
[33:18] read all the way to verse 30 here. And I
[33:20] think this is a good spot just to
[33:21] recapture this. And at that time Jesus
[33:23] answered and said, "I thank thee, oh
[33:24] Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[33:25] because thou hast hid this
[33:28] manifestation, these things from the
[33:30] wise and prudent, and have revealed what
[33:32] this manifestation is, the truth of it,
[33:34] the reality of it, unto babes. Even so,
[33:37] Father, for it seemed good in thy sight.
[33:38] It's his will. All things are delivered
[33:40] unto me of my father. And no man knoweth
[33:43] the Son, but the Father, and no man
[33:45] knoweth any man knoweth any man the
[33:48] Father, save the Son, and the Son." Now
[33:51] he the individual to whomsoever the son
[33:54] will reveal him. So no man knows these
[33:58] two. But if the son will reveal himself
[34:03] to the individual then the individual
[34:06] will know God.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus is saying here
[34:09] &gt;&gt; that to whomsoever receives this
[34:12] revelation he will know
[34:15] God. Then immediately this is what he
[34:17] says.
[34:19] Come unto me all ye that labor and are
[34:22] heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[34:27] And and and I I I'm going to my
[34:30] intention is to uh try to stop right
[34:33] about where we were right at about an
[34:34] hour when we started. If I think we
[34:37] started at 11:00.
[34:40] Nobody got that joke. I might just might
[34:43] as well just stop now. When you all
[34:45] don't get my jokes, I'm toast.
[34:47] I'm just toast. Have no future
[34:50] whatsoever. Uh we started about about
[34:53] 10:40 and so I I don't want to be much
[34:55] longer than where we are right now. Uh
[34:57] uh much longer now because I I don't
[34:59] want to go very long.
[35:01] Catch this. Christ is saying that when
[35:03] you've seen me, you've seen the father.
[35:05] I become the means by which you will
[35:07] know God.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Think about everything we know about
[35:10] God.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Come unto me all you that
[35:12] labor and are heavy laden." Now, we we
[35:14] like that thought because we're
[35:15] thinking, "Yes, God, this great God,
[35:18] he'll bear my burdens. He'll he's
[35:20] powerful. He will deliver me of my
[35:22] enemies, and I will give you rest."
[35:24] Verse 29, "Take my yoke upon you and
[35:28] learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
[35:30] heart."
[35:32] &gt;&gt; All right,
[35:35] hold on here. I thought we were going to
[35:36] be gods, right? Vengeance is mine, saith
[35:40] the next Lord, me, right?
[35:43] Hey, I thought I was going to be I was
[35:46] going to be godly and godlike and I'm
[35:49] going to know God and he's going to be
[35:50] like Zeus or Jupiter. But then Jesus
[35:53] says, "Learn of me." This is on the
[35:55] heels of him saying, "NO MAN KNOWS GOD
[35:57] EXCEPT THE SON who will reveal him." And
[36:00] Jesus is saying, "Learn of me. Learn
[36:02] from me. Take my yoke and learn. I am
[36:06] meek and lowly in heart."
[36:08] &gt;&gt; So let's just say this immediately. I
[36:11] think what we could all accept is that
[36:12] unless we come with some sort of
[36:14] meekness and humility, we will never
[36:15] know and never be taught and know God.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; But a and I'd like to also add to that
[36:24] is God.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; IN THE PORTRAIT OF GOD, there is this
[36:28] meekness and loneliness of heart. He
[36:31] says, "And you shall find rest UNTO YOUR
[36:33] SOULS." HE SAYS, "FOR my yoke is easy,
[36:34] easy, and my burden is light." We think
[36:36] all this unbburdening, this unyoking in
[36:39] Christ. Well, we are unbburdened from
[36:41] sin. We are unyoked from death. There's
[36:43] this unyoking that does take place. BUT
[36:46] JESUS CHRIST HIGHLIGHTS THE
[36:48] CHARACTERISTICS of God or these certain
[36:50] manifestations of God. Characteristics,
[36:53] I'd say, of submission, meekness and
[36:55] humility. Submission to the yoke, this
[36:58] meekness and humility, loneliness of
[37:00] heart.
[37:02] And he's saying this, when to know God,
[37:04] you have to know him through the son. So
[37:06] learn of me, take a yoke. But if I could
[37:09] say this, when he says, "Take my yoke,"
[37:10] it's an invitation to be joined with
[37:14] Christ in his burden.
[37:16] When he says, "Take my yoke," Christ is
[37:20] not taking off his yoke and placing it
[37:23] on you, but he's implying, "Let's join
[37:27] together."
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; My burden, my calling, my work.
[37:32] 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse14 but be
[37:35] ye not unequally yolked together with
[37:38] unbelievers. So he's saying this to
[37:40] believers
[37:41] and he's saying do not join yourself to
[37:44] one another for what fellowship hath
[37:47] righteousness with unrighteousness. So
[37:48] think of this joining to take Christ's
[37:51] yoke is to be equally joined with Christ
[37:53] so that you can have fellowship with him
[37:55] and who he is and communion with the
[37:57] light. So it is in that equal joining
[38:01] together that there's going to be this
[38:03] learning and this understanding of the
[38:05] God and the father. So it says be not
[38:08] unequally yolked teaches us that there's
[38:10] this agreement in common labor. When it
[38:14] says be une do not be un uh unequally
[38:17] yolked. He's saying do not be yolked
[38:19] with unbelievers because that would be
[38:21] inequality in burden
[38:25] &gt;&gt; inequality in purpose and calling.
[38:29] Now I want to make this central to where
[38:33] to the the thought today
[38:36] is his yoke. Take my yoke upon you. His
[38:40] yoke was to manifest the father.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; That was his burden.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; This is why Jesus says, "I do nothing
[38:49] except that the father tells me to do. I
[38:52] say nothing but what the father tells me
[38:54] to say." because he had a burden and a
[38:56] calling to accurately portray God.
[39:04] How would it what would it what would
[39:06] have happened if Jesus just to expedite
[39:09] difficult situations and they bring a
[39:11] woman who CAUGHT COMMITTED ADULTERY
[39:13] BEFORE him and says well what are you
[39:14] going to do about he says adultery who
[39:16] cares anymore
[39:18] that would have that would have
[39:20] represented the heart of God
[39:22] &gt;&gt; right
[39:22] &gt;&gt; we could then take this whole body of
[39:25] work or take this example from Christ
[39:27] and say adultery doesn't matter why are
[39:29] we making a deal out of it.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS COULDN'T DO THAT.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; There had to be a particular way THAT HE
[39:35] RESPONDS THAT DECLARES GOD'S ATTITUDE
[39:38] TOWARDS SIN.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; That keeps in IT KEEPS WHOLE THOSE
[39:42] THINGS THAT ARE ABOMINABLE TO GOD. THOSE
[39:45] THINGS THAT GOD DOES NOT LOVE THAT God
[39:46] is not pleased with. He could not though
[39:49] man is confused and there's certain
[39:50] paradoxes and no doubt there all the
[39:52] manifestations of God are not so
[39:54] pristine and perfect to where the
[39:55] picture remains clear for everyone to
[39:57] see. He had a responsibility to in
[40:00] reality portray God.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[40:05] he was a living picture of the father.
[40:09] He was living God.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; The living word.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[40:19] is the living word
[40:21] &gt;&gt; that makes God present.
[40:23] Hallelujah.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; That is why a Jesus could say before
[40:27] Abraham was, I am.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; That is why Paul could say, "Have I not
[40:32] met Jesus Christ our Lord?"
[40:36] &gt;&gt; When Jesus of Nazareth wasn't before
[40:38] Abraham, nor did Paul have the privilege
[40:41] of meeting Jesus of Nazareth on earth.
[40:44] But it was by the revelation of Jesus
[40:46] Christ, which is the word that makes God
[40:49] present, that God was known.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:53] And now he says to you, and this is
[40:56] where the transition comes, and
[40:57] hopefully in the next couple services we
[40:59] can address this in great detail or to
[41:02] some detail. Now he invites the elect of
[41:04] God to join in the calling to portray
[41:09] the attributes of God.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Take my yoke.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Take my yoke upon you.
[41:17] This means that there is some communion
[41:20] and fellowship that we have to have with
[41:21] Christ and we have to be joined in this
[41:24] calling to be a portrait of a perfect
[41:27] man.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't like that
[41:31] because you may THINK A LOT OF BAD
[41:33] THINGS ABOUT ME, but one of them is not
[41:35] that I think I'm perfect.
[41:40] There is a calling though for you to
[41:43] portray Christ.
[41:46] And in portraying Christ, you portray
[41:47] the father.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; In Galatians chapter 1,
[41:56] I have verses 11 to 17. We'll see just
[41:59] how how far we can get in this.
[42:06] I the timing is is going much quicker
[42:09] than I thought, but we only we have just
[42:11] a short period here, but let's just
[42:12] focus on this now together. I hope that
[42:15] we're being able to kind of follow along
[42:17] in this being very deliberate. Verse 11,
[42:19] Galatians 1:1. But I certify you,
[42:21] brethren, that the gospel, if the gospel
[42:23] be hid, what is the gospel? Jesus
[42:25] Christ. What does he reveal? The father
[42:27] that the gospel which was preached of
[42:29] me, Jesus, Paul said, I preach no other
[42:31] gospel but Christ. this gospel which was
[42:34] preached of me is not after man. What he
[42:37] means by after man, it doesn't mean
[42:39] postman uh or that it would be before
[42:41] man, but that in other words, I have not
[42:43] learned this from man.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; To say he received it of man as he says
[42:49] in verse 12, for neither for I neither
[42:51] received it of man neither was I taught
[42:52] it that means he's saying that I have
[42:54] was not did not learn Christ by
[42:56] observing flesh.
[42:58] I did not know co Christ by uh learning
[43:02] from man flesh. This is he said the
[43:06] gospel which I preach. I'm not just
[43:09] saying what a man said.
[43:11] I'm not just this wasn't just alone what
[43:13] I was taught by man. This is what the
[43:15] rabbis would do about the the scripture.
[43:17] They could only teach what they read.
[43:20] But when Jesus said this day this
[43:21] scripture is fulfilled. If you have a
[43:22] revelation of that, then what you teach
[43:24] and what you can preach is not after
[43:26] man,
[43:27] &gt;&gt; but it's after the fulfillment.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; He says, I didn't just receive it from
[43:31] man, neither was I taught it by man, but
[43:33] by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[43:37] I will now
[43:39] uh focus on I mentioned it earlier in
[43:42] terms of manifestations and how you
[43:44] could write about what you observe and
[43:46] what you see or art can portray a
[43:48] manifestation of God.
[43:51] It's not just the external manifestation
[43:54] then that when we behold it and we see
[43:56] it that we can then begin to uh paint
[43:59] that picture as we observe it. And some
[44:01] artists can do that. They just trace.
[44:03] Can't tell you how many times uh my
[44:05] daughter has come to me and shown me
[44:06] something and I'm like you trace that
[44:08] like you you cheated. That's AI.
[44:12] And she'll say no. And what she'll do is
[44:14] she'll look at something and she can
[44:17] draw what she sees.
[44:19] And it's it's not realism in the sense
[44:21] that I don't know which one's real.
[44:24] Sometimes you see those in terms of
[44:25] which one's real, faith or cake, right?
[44:28] And all you got to do is test it and you
[44:29] figure it out. So there's a way that you
[44:31] can observe something in its
[44:32] manifestation and describe it. But
[44:34] that's not what Paul is saying. What
[44:35] Paul is saying now is that I've received
[44:38] it by revelation of Jesus Christ. Yeah.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; So then if I could put it in these words
[44:43] to say that revelation
[44:45] uh he says the gospel
[44:48] I received I'm trying to summarize the
[44:50] way he says here by the revelation of
[44:51] Jesus Christ. So revelation from without
[44:54] or from man is a contradiction.
[44:57] Catch this. I received it by revelation
[45:00] of Jesus Christ. So the there's no such
[45:02] thing as external revelation
[45:06] and maybe there's some semantics to this
[45:08] but I am making a dist distinction
[45:09] between manifestation and the revelation
[45:11] of the manifestation
[45:14] &gt;&gt; because no external manifestation alone
[45:17] reveals God.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Otherwise nature itself would have been
[45:23] sufficient.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CREATION ITSELF.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; IF IT COULD REVEAL GOD, then God could
[45:30] have just done it through nature.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; And then and and that we I could argue
[45:36] my response to that would be, well,
[45:37] nature doesn't fully reveal God. We say,
[45:39] "All right, that's good. So, who did who
[45:41] fully embodied the father? Jesus Christ
[45:43] did." But that manifestation alone
[45:47] in seeing him, NOT EVERYBODY WHO SAW HIM
[45:50] SAID, "GOD, WHAT'S UP?"
[45:53] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[45:54] THAT'S DEITY RIGHT THERE.
[45:57] THAT THAT'S THAT'S my heaven boy, NOT MY
[45:59] HOMEBOY, RIGHT? THAT'S GOD RIGHT THERE.
[46:01] NO, THEY DIDN'T SEE IT LIKE that
[46:04] &gt;&gt; because it took a revelation to see God.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 64:4, from since the beginning
[46:10] of the world, men have not heard, nor
[46:13] perceived by the ear,
[46:15] &gt;&gt; neither hath the eye seen, oh God.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; I love it. You'd almost just say they
[46:21] have not seen you. But he says, "Oh God,
[46:22] beside thee, what he hath prepared for
[46:25] him that waiteth for him."
[46:28] Isaiah is drawing from a very clear
[46:31] principle in scripture that God is not
[46:33] known by outward senses. His
[46:35] manifestation can be felt.
[46:38] The effects of his presence can be
[46:40] observed. What was the earthquake, the
[46:42] wind, and the fire to Elijah?
[46:45] The effects of his passing by.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Or was it Elisha? I'm going I'm losing
[46:52] it. My jokes don't land. Now I can't get
[46:54] Elijah and Elisha together. So there is
[47:00] he's saying that I have not seen that
[47:03] men have not heard with the ear or seen
[47:05] with the eyes things that God has made
[47:08] or prepared the reality that this what
[47:10] it is. If I could put it in these terms,
[47:13] no description of God's glory could
[47:14] illuminate our souls to his brilliant
[47:18] beauty.
[47:20] No, no description. Oh, God is all
[47:24] powerful. God fills all time and space.
[47:27] And we begin to talk about God and his
[47:29] greatness and his glory. TALK ABOUT
[47:30] CREATION AND TALK about the stars.
[47:32] There's no picture that can be painted
[47:35] OR STORY TOLD THAT COULD ILLUMINATE THE
[47:37] SOUL to this truth.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; No explanation of Christ can DECLARE HIS
[47:43] GREATNESS TO OUR SOULS.
[47:47] NOTICE it says in 1 Corinthians chapter
[47:49] 2:es 9 and 10. But as it is written, I
[47:51] hath not seen nor ear heard. This is
[47:53] where the as written was. As written,
[47:55] Isaiah 64. But as it as it is written, I
[47:58] hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
[48:00] have entered into the heart of man. The
[48:02] things which God prepared for them that
[48:04] love him. Why don't they crucify Paul in
[48:06] this instance for completely butchering
[48:09] the words of Isaiah here? Because he
[48:11] said, "Hath prepared for him that
[48:12] waiteth for him." And here he says,
[48:13] "Hath prepared for them that love him."
[48:17] Perhaps
[48:19] faithfulness to the semantics isn't what
[48:22] is is true faith or obedience. But
[48:25] understanding
[48:27] &gt;&gt; that level that that to say him that
[48:29] waitth for him. It's not just merely
[48:31] someone who's patient, but someone who
[48:32] loves, who understands, who's been
[48:34] touched and feels. He says, "Now, now
[48:36] Paul adds verse 10, but God hath
[48:38] revealed them unto us by his spirit.
[48:41] For the spirit searchth all things, yay,
[48:43] the deep things.
[48:45] What we need
[48:48] in addition to throat coat
[48:51] is we need a revelation by the spirit to
[48:53] our soul.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; The the external manifestation can be
[49:02] described
[49:03] but that description is not the
[49:06] revelation.
[49:08] The gospels describe
[49:11] a and I I'll say this as we even
[49:13] piggybacking off of what Paul says here.
[49:15] He's received the revelation of Jesus
[49:17] Christ. Paul essentially writes the New
[49:18] Testament. So what is he writing? What's
[49:20] been revealed to him and how he has
[49:23] manifested God has manifested himself to
[49:25] him. But those that beautiful work of
[49:28] art which this scripture is alone is not
[49:30] what we worship nor is in reading this
[49:32] the that describes the manifestation and
[49:35] and being able to understand WHAT IT
[49:37] SAYS. NOR THAT is not to know God. It
[49:39] takes a revealing of the word, of the
[49:42] scripture, OF THAT PORTRAIT THAT'S
[49:45] PAINTED IN THE GOSPELS THAT HAS TO BE
[49:47] REVEALED TO US TO BE ABLE TO SAY, "I
[49:48] KNOW him
[49:50] &gt;&gt; as my savior."
[49:53] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 4:6 said, "We haven't
[49:56] already read verse four, how the mind
[49:58] was blinded,
[50:00] lest the light shine." Now he says in
[50:02] verse 6, "For God who commanded the
[50:03] light to shine out of darkness hath
[50:05] shined into our hearts." There are some
[50:06] that are blinded, BUT NOW THAT SAME
[50:08] LIGHT SHINES INTO WHERE? Our hearts to
[50:10] give the light of the knowledge of the
[50:12] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[50:14] Christ.
[50:16] It means that you could be looking at
[50:18] Jesus Christ,
[50:20] looking at it. But unless the light
[50:24] shines into your heart,
[50:26] &gt;&gt; you'll never see the glory of God in the
[50:28] face of Jesus Christ.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; The light has to shine. The revelation
[50:33] of the portrait of Christ is what allows
[50:36] us to truly recognize him and know him.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Someone could say, "Well, what are you
[50:42] looking at? I'm looking at a dark blonde
[50:45] hair,
[50:46] blue-eyed Jesus."
[50:49] You know, "Oh,
[50:50] that's the Christ of 1940 painted by
[50:53] Salman who wanted to make Jesus more
[50:55] recognizable and it almost looks like a
[50:57] head shot for a social media post." No,
[50:59] that's that's not Christ. They'll say,
[51:01] "Well, I'm looking at a man who was born
[51:03] of a virgin. I'm looking at a man who
[51:05] walked on water. I'm looking." It's
[51:06] like, "Okay, that's what the scripture
[51:09] says,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; but how do you know him?"
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Verse 13, for you have heard of my con
[51:19] conversation in time past in the Jews.
[51:21] He's in my prior life, Jews religion,
[51:24] how that beyond measure I persecuted the
[51:26] church of God and wasted it. There's a
[51:28] lot of there's a lot of really
[51:29] fascinating things about Paul and his
[51:31] position a as Paul is looking at
[51:36] the gospel that he received as the
[51:38] fulfillment of everything he said or
[51:41] believed as a Jew which is true because
[51:43] the promises that we're to receive in
[51:45] this hour is not necessarily a departure
[51:47] from Christianity. It's the fulfillment
[51:49] of everything Christianity has believed.
[51:52] And yet what
[51:55] Paul is describing is not the elevation
[51:57] of Judaism,
[52:00] &gt;&gt; not the next step or evolution of
[52:01] Judaism. It's almost as if Judaism
[52:03] always foreshadowed this, but now here
[52:05] comes the perfect fulfillment
[52:07] &gt;&gt; of all the hopes of Israel. And now this
[52:09] has become what being a Jew is. That's
[52:11] why you come to Revelation. It says
[52:12] there's those that claim to be Jews, but
[52:14] there are the synagogue of Satan. says,
[52:15] "Those that profess to be Christians,
[52:18] profess to be the real chosen of God,
[52:21] but yet have not yet received his Holy
[52:22] Spirit are not born again."
[52:24] &gt;&gt; So he says, he's speaking of this, "How
[52:26] beyond measure I persecuted the church
[52:27] of God and wasted it and profited in the
[52:30] Jews religion above many my equals in my
[52:32] own nation, being more exceedingly
[52:34] zealous of the traditions of my
[52:36] fathers." [snorts]
[52:38] But when it pleased God, for so it
[52:41] seemed good in thy sight. But when it
[52:43] pleased God, catch this beautiful
[52:46] phrasing, who separated me from my
[52:48] mother's womb.
[52:50] So God's calling in Paul's life was in
[52:55] him from birth.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to do. He's
[52:57] trying to bring this distinction. I've
[52:58] lived this entire life believing
[53:00] something and then I wasted the church
[53:04] and but yet this calling was in me from
[53:07] the beginning. He separated from my
[53:08] mother's womb and called me by his
[53:10] grace.
[53:13] to reveal his son in me.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; to reveal his son in me.
[53:24] I was ordained. He's saying from the
[53:26] very beginning.
[53:29] It pleased God. It was good in GOD'S
[53:31] SIGHT TO DETERMINE his calling in me
[53:34] from birth. It's there. It's been there
[53:36] my whole life. To reveal his son in me.
[53:40] Christ was revealed in Paul,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; not to Paul
[53:46] &gt;&gt; or not just to Paul.
[53:49] If I could put it in these terms,
[53:53] can something be revealed to you
[53:57] that has not been revealed in you?
[54:02] Come on, all you philosophy majors,
[54:04] you're like, "Now, let's talk.
[54:10] Why did they not see beauty in Jesus
[54:12] Christ?
[54:14] Why did they not see an attraction in
[54:16] Jesus Christ? Because that beauty wasn't
[54:18] in them.
[54:20] Why did they not see the light of the
[54:23] world, the light of God, the light of
[54:24] the word, because that light was not in
[54:26] them?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; You following me? That's scripture.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; They didn't recognize it. They didn't
[54:32] see it because it wasn't in them.
[54:36] So now we begin to realize what's
[54:38] happening is almost like this inversion.
[54:40] You see Jesus AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH,
[54:41] THAT'S GOD. THAT'S CHRIST." BUT IT WAS
[54:44] IN HERE FIRST.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Something was there first.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just the eye that sees or the
[54:53] ear that hears.
[54:56] This is what the scripture Isaiah 64 and
[54:58] 1 Corinthians are saying, but it's the
[54:59] soul that responds to the spirit, the
[55:01] capital S spirit, the spirit of God.
[55:03] Right?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; You can only appreciate and admire
[55:06] beauty when you have beauty in your
[55:08] heart.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, how many of us could look at a
[55:12] FOOT AND SAY, "WOW, THAT IS A PERFECT
[55:15] FOOT."
[55:17] Unless you've been trained,
[55:19] right, as a podiatrist TO SAY, "WOW,
[55:22] THAT IS A PERFECT FOOT." Thank you,
[55:25] brother Scott. Wash my feet. That's what
[55:27] we're here for, right?
[55:30] Bible does say beautiful are the feet of
[55:32] them that preach the gospel.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Right? I don't care how ugly my feet
[55:36] look right now. I've got this promise
[55:38] that says it's beautiful.
[55:42] I've got band-aids on two of my toes
[55:44] right now as I say that.
[55:46] There there has to be it has to be in
[55:49] you first.
[55:51] You can only admire this has meant so
[55:54] much to me as of late. You can only
[55:56] admire
[55:57] I thank God for this. You can only
[55:59] admire what's in your soul.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I find myself often admiring believers.
[56:04] Some of the brothers in this church, I
[56:06] admire them because they seem to be so
[56:08] much unlike me. And I realize I only
[56:11] admire that trait in them
[56:14] &gt;&gt; because it's in me to be that also.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; You can only admire what's in your
[56:20] heart. How did you know what love was?
[56:27] Kindness can be appreciated because
[56:30] kindness is in your heart.
[56:33] Diligent, someone who WORKS HARD, YOU
[56:36] ADMIRE THAT, you appreciate it because
[56:37] it's in your heart.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; That's why people can work hard and they
[56:41] can be kind. People don't appreciate it.
[56:43] It's not in them.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; For beauty, for characteristics, for
[56:47] attributes to truly be admired, they
[56:49] must be possessed.
[56:52] Why is it Why is it you cry over at at a
[56:56] painting? Why is it some people are
[56:57] moved to tears? Why is it that even
[56:59] maybe some movies or music
[57:03] causes us to weep? Because it appeals to
[57:05] experience.
[57:08] I remember that my propensity to get
[57:10] emotional was exponential uh once you
[57:14] marry and have children because now
[57:16] there's a greater depth of relationship
[57:18] and empathy and there's feelings you
[57:20] never knew before
[57:22] but we respond TO THINGS BECAUSE THAT
[57:25] THAT what's being depicted is in us.
[57:29] If the feeling is not previously within,
[57:33] if the feeling is not previously within,
[57:35] the manifestation will not put it there.
[57:39] You could be wa watching a a family
[57:42] movie that's been vid angel um and and
[57:46] and you're watching it and all of a
[57:48] sudden a a mom begins to cry and the
[57:51] kids like
[57:55] her baby just died. That's it, man. Like
[57:58] what are you getting all weepy for?
[58:00] Right? Cuz a mom's looking at being
[58:01] like, "Ah,
[58:04] right. There has to be the
[58:06] manifestation.
[58:08] People look at things and the
[58:09] manifestation itself doesn't cause
[58:11] everyone to, oh, Jesus Christ was the
[58:14] perfection of beauty." AND PEOPLE LOOKED
[58:15] AT THAT AND TURNED THEIR EYES.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; The musicians, if you'd please come to
[58:21] your instruments, we'll close here.
[58:27] these things that I I'm I'm stopping on
[58:30] that it's not just with the eye that
[58:32] sees or the ear that hears, but there's
[58:34] got to be a light that strikes the soul.
[58:36] And I say, I've seen the portrait of a
[58:38] perfect man by revelation because look,
[58:41] I read the Bible. I read the Bible and
[58:44] he's painted here, but it's got to be
[58:46] revealed to me by his spirit.
[58:49] And when it's revealed to me by his
[58:50] spirit, it's almost like this
[58:51] discovering myself
[58:54] because Paul said it was a mirror.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; It's in you. And we look at it, we read
[59:00] it. Maybe we've been very religious.
[59:02] We've had life experiences. And just as
[59:03] Paul said, it was always there from the
[59:06] time I was born. But now God did
[59:08] something deeper and he discovered I was
[59:11] allowed to by the spirit discover
[59:13] something that was in me that I never
[59:14] knew was there.
[59:17] And this is the description that's being
[59:19] made. It's not just the eye that sees or
[59:21] the ear that hears. That sound familiar,
[59:24] Eliza? My daughter Eliza sent me this
[59:26] statement this [music] morning. She text
[59:28] this to me in the sermon, the voice of
[59:29] God in the last days. She texted to
[59:31] [music] our family little family chat
[59:35] that I know some of you are triggered by
[59:36] and you submitted a request that I not
[59:38] mention that and uh it got past our
[59:40] filters. It was in [music] our spam
[59:42] folder. I apologize, but
[59:44] I know what it's like to leave family
[59:46] chats. [music] Trust me.
[59:48] He said Moses heard the voice of God.
[59:51] So Moses, he hears the voice of God.
[59:54] [music] Remember, he knew he was well
[59:56] taught.
[59:58] He was well taught in the the religion
[1:00:00] of Egypt. But then even Moses was told
[1:00:02] that he was a deliverer. And what did he
[1:00:03] try to do by that teaching?
[1:00:07] [music] This understanding, well, I'm to
[1:00:08] be a deliverer. And what did it produce?
[1:00:10] One dead Egyptian.
[1:00:13] But then he heard the voice of God and
[1:00:16] Moses was never the same.
[1:00:18] You could be told over and over again,
[1:00:20] over and over again, service after
[1:00:21] service, sermon after sermon, scripture
[1:00:23] after scripture, but then when God
[1:00:25] speaks to you, you're never the same.
[1:00:26] And he said, "No man is ever the same.
[1:00:29] You might hear in your ears the voice
[1:00:32] speaking, but when you hear in your
[1:00:34] heart the voice speaking, [music]
[1:00:37] then you are hearing." We had about a
[1:00:40] 30-minute conversation yesterday among
[1:00:41] all six family members on what the
[1:00:43] difference [music] what hearing means
[1:00:44] and what listening means.
[1:00:47] And it was very this is not what
[1:00:48] inspired the sermon.
[1:00:50] Uh though I'd like I'd love for you to
[1:00:53] think that some [music] conversation in
[1:00:54] the afternoon could produce this. But
[1:00:57] what I received was not of man.
[1:01:00] When you hear his voice, then you're
[1:01:02] hearing. You do not see with your eye.
[1:01:04] You look with your eye. You see with
[1:01:06] [music] your heart.
[1:01:08] Do you see that? Yeah, I see that.
[1:01:10] Describe it. It's like, uh, do you see
[1:01:13] with your heart?
[1:01:15] I see this. I [music] see that. I see
[1:01:17] this. I see that. I read this. I read
[1:01:18] that. But do you see with your heart?
[1:01:20] You see something, say, I just don't see
[1:01:21] it. What do you mean? I don't understand
[1:01:23] it. You do not hear with your ears. You
[1:01:26] hear with your heart. Many times your
[1:01:28] ears hear the true voice of God and it
[1:01:30] falls [music] off you like water off a
[1:01:31] duck's back.
[1:01:33] But when you really hear, you hear with
[1:01:35] your heart.
[1:01:37] It's because Christ is revealed to our
[1:01:39] heart that we see Christ.
[1:01:42] And therefore, [music] it's not it's not
[1:01:44] that we just pass out Bibles and the
[1:01:46] Bible, all the read the Bible, read the
[1:01:48] Bible. But we we pray for revelation
[1:01:50] that God would reveal Christ
[1:01:55] that the light would strike and be
[1:01:57] revealed in the heart. And that's when
[1:01:59] the eye is opened to see God in the
[1:02:02] manifestation. [music]
[1:02:04] See, it doesn't work externally.
[1:02:06] When the word is preached, you hear it.
[1:02:10] But when supernaturally the light in
[1:02:12] that [music] word strikes your soul,
[1:02:15] then you're like, "Oh, wait a minute.
[1:02:17] That's the truth.
[1:02:20] That's what God is wanting us to be." If
[1:02:22] I could just end here, [music] we'll
[1:02:23] continue in some of these other things
[1:02:26] because I'll just say it. He said, "He
[1:02:29] reveals his son in me that I might
[1:02:32] preach him
[1:02:35] among the Gentiles."
[1:02:37] That is you.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; He is wanting to reveal himself in
[1:02:43] [music] you. This internal, not the
[1:02:45] external, but this internal
[1:02:47] transformation in a re revelation of the
[1:02:49] portrait of a perfect man. And then we
[1:02:51] could all say, "Oh, we've got it. We've
[1:02:52] got it. We've got it. But [music] he
[1:02:53] says, "No, I've revealed him in you so
[1:02:55] that you could now be an expression, a
[1:02:58] [music] measure of that perfect man
[1:03:00] that our light, our manifestation could
[1:03:04] be the means by which God can
[1:03:06] supernaturally transmit." And someone
[1:03:08] sees you and you're like, "I don't know
[1:03:10] what it is, but I I I'm inquiring. I'm
[1:03:14] wanting to know." And then what we what
[1:03:16] [music] we desire is that God would
[1:03:17] reveal himself to his children. If we
[1:03:20] could stand to our feet today,
[1:03:24] [music]
[1:03:28] let's pray. If you desire prayer, we're
[1:03:31] always available [music] to pray with
[1:03:32] you.
[1:03:34] But I believe that
[1:03:37] you, if you haven't discovered it, you
[1:03:40] [music] have faith in you right now to
[1:03:42] receive it where you are. [snorts]
[1:03:44] A gracious heavenly father.
[1:03:47] Lord, I feel
[1:03:49] a little little uneasy just as a man and
[1:03:52] maybe just with my knowing what [music]
[1:03:54] else we had to share today that we could
[1:03:56] be leaving this in a spot that's
[1:03:57] incomplete.
[1:03:59] But Lord, if I have not seen nor ear
[1:04:01] heard or is even entered into our
[1:04:04] imagination, our thoughts and what we
[1:04:05] could conjecture and expect the things
[1:04:08] which you have prepared for us [music]
[1:04:10] because we love you.
[1:04:13] And for those that are the called
[1:04:14] according to your purpose,
[1:04:16] perhaps you could just fill the void now
[1:04:20] by revelation.
[1:04:22] What we have not heard, what we have not
[1:04:24] seen, Lord, [music] you could just
[1:04:25] quicken into our hearts and we could be
[1:04:26] satisfied today to know that the Bible
[1:04:30] is a portrait
[1:04:34] of a perfect man. [music]
[1:04:36] But it's not until you reveal yourself
[1:04:39] in us that [music] we can now look into
[1:04:42] the portrait and see you.
[1:04:46] And Lord, we will not get this
[1:04:48] revelation just by merely laying
[1:04:52] on on a cot and just trying to make our
[1:04:55] minds go blank.
[1:04:57] Truly, Lord, there's just this way that
[1:04:59] you use prayer and you use reading the
[1:05:02] Bible and you use the preaching of the
[1:05:04] word of God and listening to the word
[1:05:06] and reading the word. You use that as a
[1:05:07] means of kind of just moving our spirits
[1:05:10] long enough for that channel to open for
[1:05:12] the true light of your word to enter our
[1:05:13] hearts
[1:05:15] because it is radiating. It is shining.
[1:05:19] And therefore, Lord, your scripture
[1:05:20] teaches [music] that we all with open
[1:05:22] face beholding him as in a glass that's
[1:05:24] a mirror. [snorts]
[1:05:26] May the obstructions be moved out of the
[1:05:28] way so that we do see you. But then
[1:05:30] being seeing you take this yoke. We take
[1:05:32] this yoke upon us because now we don't
[1:05:34] just see you but we see ourselves in
[1:05:36] you. And we realize that we have this
[1:05:38] revelation of Jesus Christ in our souls.
[1:05:39] And it's joined us to the same calling
[1:05:41] to be a manifestation of God in this
[1:05:44] last days.
[1:05:47] And so Lord, so much of our lives
[1:05:49] becomes this [music] balance of being
[1:05:50] able to keep that mirror unobstructed so
[1:05:52] that we're seeing you,
[1:05:54] so that others could see you.
[1:05:57] And Lord, bless us today as we have many
[1:05:59] needs in our hearts. We have many needs
[1:06:00] [music] in our lives physically,
[1:06:01] spiritually, emotionally, financially.
[1:06:03] Lord, there's not one need
[1:06:07] that's not represented by those hearing
[1:06:09] this today.
[1:06:12] And I pray that [music] you would break
[1:06:13] every chain of addiction.
[1:06:15] you would heal all sorts of fears and
[1:06:18] anxieties [music] because of
[1:06:19] afflictions.
[1:06:21] That you would deliver those that are
[1:06:23] oppressed. [music]
[1:06:26] That you would give wisdom to those who
[1:06:28] are financially laboring.
[1:06:33] And Lord, above all, we pray we pray and
[1:06:35] [music] we call upon you for revelation
[1:06:37] more than anything.
[1:06:39] more than anything, Lord, because it's
[1:06:41] transformative.
[1:06:44] And Jesus [music] Christ is
[1:06:49] the stature, the measurements, the
[1:06:51] proportions of a [music] perfect man.
[1:06:54] And truly, Lord, the word of God as
[1:06:56] written
[1:06:58] tells us about that image. the prophets,
[1:07:01] the disciples, and Paul wrote
[1:07:05] a great work of art that describes that
[1:07:08] paints the picture of a perfect man.
[1:07:10] [music] But Lord, we'll never see it
[1:07:12] until you reveal it in us. That's
[1:07:16] [music] our prayer, Lord. We ask this in
[1:07:17] the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
