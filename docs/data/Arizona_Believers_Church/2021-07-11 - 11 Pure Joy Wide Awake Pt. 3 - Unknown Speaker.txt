TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matthew chapter 26 verses 36 to 44. then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye hear while i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and two sons of zebedee and begin to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye hear and watch with me so he's wanting them he's trying to impress upon them the severity the urgency of the moment and so he expresses just how sorrowful he is and then he tells them terry and watch watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh father if it be possible let this cup pass for me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words let's bow our heads please our gracious heavenly father we know that the word which we have read is eternal we know that it is perfect man may look upon it and find inconsistencies or historical inaccuracies or unable to even find maybe some archaeological affirmation that these things are true may even be able to look within the text itself and find what they believe to be contradictions or inconsistencies yet lord within this written word that to man into the eyes of man and man's logic may seem flawed there's a revelation of jesus christ that is perfect and lord we pray that as we read these verses that christ could be made alive to us through them and to do that lord it would take you any man could turn the pages of the bible but it takes you to turn the heart it takes you to make it real to us by revelation so come lord take the subject that lays before us and speak to the people that sit before me lord in a way that is special that touches their heart and encourages them we love you and we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you you can take your seats continue on the subject of wide awake and under the thought of pure joy and i want to maybe i want to make just a few statements in the outset to kind of gather us all together just the exact spot that we are as we've ministered on the subject of pure joy in several services and approached it from different angles i feel now that we're really getting into the real thrust of what god was dealing with my heart when the thought came to me of pure joy even how we're we read in the church age book brother and says and may his coming rejoice your heart and different principles in the scripture how that the believer's reaction to the word of god being fulfilled ought to be one of joy and that we ought to be so impressed by watching god confirm and vindicate his promises and interpret his word by bringing it to pass that that becomes the source of our exaltation and our jubilance and our in our happiness as opposed to all the horrible things that are going on in the world as a matter of fact when you see something horrible happen when you can connect it with prophecy what does that often do to you give you peace oh god's in control he talked about this he said this would happen and we even recognize that jesus told his disciples certain things and said i'm telling you this now so that what happens it'll give you confidence knowing that i prophesied it before so the source of our joy is connected to god fulfilling his word so i feel in this subject of wide awake i'm kind of coming to some of the principles that really inspired this whole subject and as we're looking at pure joy we're kind of using this thought that pure joy is found in or experienced in being wide awake and brother bam talks about our spirits being clean and sober and serious and it being fresh and it being real and so we've talked about a conscience that we have a clean conscience and now we're looking at maybe our consciousness how that we ought to be wide awake so a healthy conscience is one that is serious and being fully conscious that is one that is sober it's not uh inordinately impacted or stimulated by the wrong things to pervert our senses and one thing i think we have made at one point we made last time is our clean conscience if we have a healthy conscience it's not defiled it's not weak it's not seared but we have a healthy clean conscience that means we know that our sins are forgiven we we are in contact with the holy spirit down inside of our souls which is kind of telling us that's not right that's not right do this do that then uh then that's there's that alignment that we need but that clean conscience operates perfectly within full consciousness if your senses are dulled or you're kind of drunken or a little bit in a stoop or you're not completely aware and you're not fully alert even in our senses of our mind and our body then that clean conscience is not able to function uh under the control of that man on the inside of the man the holy ghost in the soul and so this full consciousness we're looking at in terms of being awake a statement we looked at last time and recognizing your day and its message and how people feel the pull of the hour and they feel this excitement it's like fast pray and fast pray and they and they're using these uh these uh this herald of his coming to try to get the people we should be urgent and we should be expecting and we should be waiting and brother bam says they they feel the pull of the hour because they're christians but they've missed something he says they have not recognized the awakening of the bride and so i want to look at today hopefully we'll get to it what wakes her up if he says they haven't recognized the awakening of the bride that tells us that there has been a supernatural event that is to wake her up if he says that he doesn't look at it they haven't recognized that it's going to happen he said that what god has sent to wake her up has come and they haven't recognized it because they're still praying for an awakening in other words no matter how much exuberance they may exhibit they're still not awake and so there's something that wakes us up and then we're actually asking ourselves the question are we fully awake have it fully dawned on us what god is doing have we become have we've been made aware of the things that god is accomplishing in this hour we looked at first corinthians chapter 15 verse 34 he says awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame so be asleep or being unaware there is a shame involved with it i want us to remember that in the outset but he's telling us to wait to become fully aware wake up to righteousness to things as they are to things as god would desire them to be and it's in that awakening that keeps us from sin he says awake to righteousness and sin not it's through that being awakened and fully alert and aware that we're able to overcome the tempter what is to overcome is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and so that's part of being alert and part of being a wide awake is you recognize the devil and his tricks and at the same time recognize greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world could we not agree that maybe we could wake up to a greater reality of that revelation that truly greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world so paul uses this to say that to as a call to wake up to come to soberness of mind and then he connects it with some have not the knowledge of god this knowledge they do not have the knowledge of god so these things are closely connected and related now there's a lot of people that will claim that they're happy they'll even live lives that seem to suggest that they're content and they have uh um and they have a life that's full of excitement and enthusiasm but the truth is for most people they are not truly happy they are at best just unaware in other words they don't realize the consequence for sin they're not they don't they're not fully aware that there is going to be an afterlife a lot of people placate themselves and they're convinced well there is nothing there is no judgment to come there is no hell there is no heaven just live your best life now and enjoy it and so in that sense they have been able to lull themselves into a contentment and unhappiness not based upon truth but a lie and there's some that are also happy but not because they are necessarily unaware but they actually are willfully ignorant that they've heard enough they've seen enough they know enough but in order to maintain some sense of peace or stability within their spirits and that they're not troubled they will just ignore the truth and and willfully not want to know and come up with all sorts of excuses to deny truth and what we're what we find is ignorance is not truly bliss nor is ignorant strength those are the things that we looked at last time but for the believer for the bride her joy our joy is found in understanding truth that the the more we know the greater joy that we can have because our joy is inspired by more knowledge of god the more knowledge of god we have the greater happiness we have the more that we know him the the more free we are and that's where we kind of set our our affections and we say lord i want to know more about you and brother israel made a very profound point last night among many many things that he said that i think would have been worth just coming to hear and and i think that we were blessed by but one in particular he was talking about just how much people listen to the news and that that aggravates them and stimulates them and he says people take it to the pulpit and they're actually preaching against cnn behind the message pulpit they're preaching against msnbc and they're preaching against all these liberal news outlets and they're preaching against fake news it's like we have the real news the good news the gospel and we spend all our time preaching against fake news i said that also the believers will hear things on the news and they get agitated and they get all stirred up and that's what they want to talk about did you hear this did you hear that and that's kind of what dominates their conversations and he says pick up a bible man i was like amen to that pick up a bible read the good news and then as you fill your heart and mind with the good news you'll be you'll find yourself a lot happier you want to know why some of us are really really anxious we feed on too many things from the world that increases our anxiety we feed on the news channels we feed on the statistics we feed on the data we feed on the sports we feed on the metrics we're feeding on all these other forums and things and blogs and opportunities in the world and it only feeds the flesh and the flesh cannot produce faith the only thing the outcome of that is fear and we live anxious we live bound down but the more that we know of him the greater joy that we're going to have in luke chapter 22 and verse verses 31 it says in the lord said simon simon satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat again we're just kind of reviewing in the first several minutes here this was we looked at this from the standpoint that there is this we know there is a truth of the wheat plant where you as the elect as an individual you're identified as the seed we also understand that within the history of the church in the record of the wheat plant they're the bride she is the seed not the shuck but now jesus refers to peter as himself as satan wanting to sift him as wheat so he's looking at him as a wheat plant himself and we as individuals sons and daughters of god we are soul spirit and body and let me say this if you if never pondered this there's a redemption for all three and so when jesus is speaking to peter he's identifying that satan wants to do something to him as an individual because god's going to separate the wheat from the chaff he's going to separate the wheat from the shock in a rapture and he's doing that in a in a spiritual sense in a prophetic way that we see in the end time but now as individuals when satan desires to sift us as wheat there's there's an effort that he tries to make to agitate us to cause us to be in confusion and to cause us to be double-minded and all tore up and all upset and what he's wanting to do is to separate our consciousness from the deity that is on the inside of us that satan would desire to sift peter as wheat and that he'd want to separate peter from his his fleshly enthusiasm and all his zeal and his desire and never come to a birth in his soul where the seed was because she said i prayed for you that when you're converted where is that going to take place in your soul and when that takes place you can strengthen your brethren so he wants to separate our consciousness from the deity that is inside of us and create kind of this dual life where i got this life in my mind and my body but i got this life in my soul and i feed my soul when i come to church and the rest of the time it's my mind and my body in this battle and this is kind of just a retreat for the soul well it's a horrible way to live because you'll find that you spend i think it's less than three percent of your time in church it's been a while since i've done run the math on that it may be less less now but uh we don't spend that much time in church could you imagine if you're only it's only from the soul well it's in my soul that i'm really happy and you're only getting that between the hours of 10 and noon on sunday morning and the rest of the time what are you doing just living body and spirit in the world that's what satan wants to do he wants to separate sift you as wheat and in doing so create this dichotomy or this separation from the soul and the rest of your mind and your body whereas god wants to bring all three into harmony preserve them blameless and and so i want to transition here in and repeat a phrase something similar to what we said last time the bride's joy is found in walk waking up to and walking in the manifested realities of god that's the bride's joy so you being a bride member your joy is found in waking up to the realities of god being fulfilled in your hour and then also walking in these present realities of god i'm not just knowledgeable of them but i'm walking in them that's the bride's joy that's her comfort now i'm going to read this a little bit differently their text i want to read it from mark chapter 14. i'm not sure exactly why i did it this way it just happened that way but in matthew chapter 26 we read about how jesus brings um them to gethsemane and he tells his disciples to sit here and pray while or sit here while i go and pray and he brings a few with him and tells them watch with me my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death now remember that my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death wait here and watch with me this is what he commands his disciples now in mark chapter 14 verses 37 and 38 he says he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou now why is he picking on peter i mean the other guys were asleep just something about peter he kind of he's kind of putting himself up there as a target you see that in the scripture time and time again and so he speaks to the one who would have the most passion the most zeal the one that would seem to be most fervent in spirit about this hour in this time jesus i'll go to death with you and i'm willing to draw my sword and you just let me know who your enemies are and he's telling him hey come with me my heart my heart is exceedingly sorrowful unto death and he says terry here and watch with me which should have been a signal to peter right like if peter's reading into everything jesus is saying like all right we need to draw the swords and we need to get ready to fight like this would have been peter's little wink wink now is the time to sharpen your sword and be ready and and yet they go away and they sit down and they fall asleep he says peter what's going on man could you not just watch one hour could you not just do it for one hour and he says watch you and pray lest you enter in temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak now he's identifying them in a in a physical sense but it carries with it a spiritual application for us but here it says he findeth them sleeping now the fact that they're sleeping signals to us now i want us to be able to carry over a type for us in the hour that we're living in where people are spiritually asleep and our temptation is to be lulled to sleep spiritually here they are they come to this garden and he says i'm i'm so sorrowful and to death and that ought to have been like whoa they ought to give them them an adrenaline rush right that might have been like who brought the five-hour energies where's judas when you need them and and like we need to stay awake i mean this is real but instead they he he goes and he begins to pray and they fall asleep so when the bible tells us that they were sleeping they had not really caught the urgency of the moment in what it required that it's it's when and we've we've experienced this in a fleshly sense that when something happens and we could be really really tired we can be weak and we could even be sore but something happens and it causes an adrenaline rush and just by virtue of understanding the situation we get all excited in our flesh we're like whoa okay we need to do something and we need to do that and we need to move this and we need and you take this uh take this and move it here and you start doing things that you might have physically been unable to do you find that all your sleepiness goes away right you're laying there you're just getting ready to fall asleep and also in your spouse ask you a question you're like what i never thought about that what are we gonna do and you can't go back to bed all it took was something to get in your spirit and your spirit all sudden triggers something in your body says wake up buddy no time for sleep you need to figure this problem out and and and so this is in that way this is a moment when that would have made sense that jesus says something that pricks them in their hearts and it gives them this sense of urgency and it causes them this readiness and this attentiveness and to just watch for a little while so this is the type i'm wanting us to catch that they had not caught the urgency of the hour and what the hour required what the response was required and it was it was represented them physically sleeping and so he says watch he tells him to watch which means to be vigilant to be attentive in other words wake up and pay attention i my soul is exceedingly sorrowful into death wake up and pay attention wake up and even desire he says he went on a little bit further but we know that they were not going to be able to stop those that were coming and he didn't desire that they would draw the swords to defend him but he wanted them to be alert maybe even to hear what he was saying to catch what he was praying and so it means to wake up pay attention to be cautious and aware tell them saying hey watch with me watch and pray comes and finds them asleep the bible says because their eyes were heavy so there had not been a stimulation to do the things that christ had asked them to do the word watch as we mentioned before comes from the root to raise up and it means it's used to mean to recover from senses that are disoriented or to rise from slumber to take senses that are dulled and freshen them up throw some water on your face get get pay it to get it to get to attention here and observe what's happening be alert be cautious and he makes this statement and i realize that this is worth a lot more attention than i'm going to give it this morning but he says the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak he says the indeed the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak in matthew but he says the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak the spirit was eager peter even expressed often just how willing he was there was a to some degree an inflamed passion within peter's spirit to i'll go to death with you and i'll draw the sword for you and i'll never deny you this was what was in peter's uh peter's spirit as it was but he says your nature is weak and then reading it i found that this was such a a tender rebuke of the disciples that he does not berate them to say you guys are dull and you're senseless and you've got no discernment whatsoever and i might as well go find another group of people who know how to follow this message because you guys are nothing but a sleeping uh dumbos and you guys are worthless and i'm just preaching to a bunch of make-believers at best and you pretty much are all not unbelievers no he said you know what he uses this phrase and it's such a gentle rebuke he says the spirit truly is ready you you are really your spirits he commands even their spirits you're really in your spirits you're ready but your nature is weak there's still something that's lacking you mean well you have sincere intentions but you're not really fully aware of what's taking place because you're unable to cross that threshold to where then you can overcome the sleepiness of your flesh because it says their eyes were heavy uh you know this is the point where some of you can say amen i know exactly what you mean brother aaron i was on the platform one time at louisiana youth camp they do the sunrise service on easter morning so they get the kids up brother russell would go yodeling through the camp wake everybody up and everybody would still be bandaged and scarred from all his activities the day before so you'd be really really sore and feeling somewhat manipulated and abused by his antics and then he's gonna wake you up that pouring salt on the wound on a sunday morning at four o'clock or whatever it was and you all come pile into church at six o'clock in the morning i've sat on the platform for that and you would be absolutely amazed at how contorted faces can become when they're trying to stay awake at that at that time in the morning it was really i have some i wish i could remember the names of these people and i could just go back to them later and say do you know you can make a face that looks somewhat like this because they were straining and so in that way we can relate to heavy eyes amen right even right now it's kind of warm in here we're all getting sleepy and so jesus is being somewhat sensitive to their situation but in our type for us though we might have heavy eyes right now and be a little bit uncomfortable now where what we're going to gather from this is not the sense that oh i get tired during the day and i have to take this to to make it through the day and i need all this coffee to keep myself going it's more of a spiritual alertness that to some degree some of us are willing and we're desirable and we give certain uh affirmations and confessions about truth but are we are we fully awake are we to the point to where yes we have a willingness in part but are we fully willing are we fully aware for them that there was a part of them that was passionate but their nature was weak because they could not all in soul spirit and body be attentive for the moment and ready to do what the moment required they were not fully aware of the situation my soul is exceeding sorrowful what it required what he was asking them to do he says watch and pray and he says watch and pray watchfulness implies wakefulness and for us i want you to take that spiritual alertness to be wide awake now it's obvious if i told you this morning that if you're asleep physically asleep you won't hear what i'm saying could we just get a real hearty amen to that so when we talk about being wide awake it's not it's not church order where you're being disciplined and chastised because we caught some of you sleeping in church and you better watch out because we won't let you back in the next time if you slept the service before it has to do it's a given that if you're asleep you probably won't hear what i'm preaching but you can be wide awake physically but a little bit dulled spiritually and still not pick up with the preachers laying down is that true even to the point where the preacher could be laying down things that aren't even right and when you're not fully awake you're like man that was a really good service wasn't it what did he preach well he preached there's six gods but if you do the math and you don't even realize well that doesn't make sense that's that's not even scriptural and man was that not deep that was so deep that was amazing hey are you really awake are you catching what's being said do you realize how inconsistent it may be with scripture how if you're wide awake maybe even your conscience would be like hey buddy that's not right that's not lining up and so for us it is a spiritual to be spiritually wide awake in luke chapter 21 and i'd like to run through several scriptures here that touch on a a prophecy or subject in the scripture and instead of try instead of taking these particular scriptures and wanting to place them within the context of the hour that we're living in or give uh maybe substantiate the interpretation of the message i want to just kind of catch a theme that's identified in these as it relates to the subject because we're talking about being wide awake so he says in luke chapter 21 verses 34 to 36 jesus speaking and take heed to yourselves so this is a take heed pay attention notice listen any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that that day come upon you unawares so this is a caution to be sure that you're in a particular condition and state of mind that this day of trouble that was going to come to jerusalem would not catch them off guard so as far as the snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be counted accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass now just prior to this he's speaking what many believe to be and what brother branham even identifies as the desolation of jerusalem where titus comes and he besieges jerusalem and many many though many people in jerusalem thousands of people lost their lives it's very very horrible siege but the testimony is that not one christian was caught in jerusalem not one believer in the prophecy of jesus the things that jesus christ was caught in there because they paid attention to the prophecy and they recognized the signs and they fled just in time and so there is a principle that's being expressed here that if you want to take it and and apply it to what happened there in 70 something a.d and we can say well that absolutely came to pass the word was fulfilled but now we could take a principle and if we applied this to a future revealing of jesus christ how that you if you're not aware that day can take you because any time god sends a message if it's not received what follows judgment and so you can take this principle and apply it to any prophecy really that if god sends a message if you don't recognize the day that day and its message then you're left to suffer the consequences for not heeding to what the message carried and so this would apply in every age when a message came so he says you should ought to be aware your uh take heed to not let your heart be overcharged for as a snare a trap that someone is not aware of it's going to come upon everyone that is on the face of the earth watch ye therefore pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and i love this phrase hopefully we'll get to it in a little bit and to stand before the son of man this this carries with it some very tremendous meaning to stand before the son of man so if you take heed that your hearts not be overcharged so that that day does not catch you by surprise then you're going to be counted worthy to have this audience this position and this standing with the son of man come on somebody that's good stuff i like that so now let's just look at some of these words so you can just see what jesus is dealing with it says take heed lest at any time your hearts be overcharged that means to be made heavy and and the idea that it carries if your hearts are overcharged it carries and also with the words that are used next are fitting and drunkenness it carries with the idea of drinking or eating too much and then inducing a stupor have you ever eaten so much that you're tired that's not all amen so loud i start to feel like that's the only thing you guys get is when we use eating but you know there's a little bit of a myth there's a tryptophan or whatever they say is in turkey well really there's no more in that than there is in chicken the reason why you get so sleepy on thanksgiving is you eat way too much that's why you get sleepy and this is exactly what jesus is referring to the way that someone can eat too much that causes all the senses to come like you know my body is like busy digesting 12 pounds of turkey right now so i'm not really with you it's because the body is diverting energy and resources somewhere else or you could drink too much and you find that it also causes the same thing and especially if it's an intoxicating beverage it does something to your senses so to be overcharged it speaks of an excess load being brought on our senses that so much stimulation in the flesh loads our rational senses loads are our awareness and this is what jesus is talking about in the sense that if you eat too much drink too much fill your flesh too much it's going to overload your rational senses to recognize what's taking place and see what's happening around you so talk about our minds being burdened to the point where it's dulled and it stupefies our our senses our conscience to be made heavy is what it means sleepy jesus is dealing with being made unexpected and unaware due to surf fitting drunkenness and cares of this life surf fitting it it has nothing to do with actual surfing surf fitting has to do with a heaviness or a dizziness uh uh occur i'm trying to think of some of the words that i found that were synonymous with it in study in the in the in the greek that kind of like a carousing there was a an idea of this heaviness in this dizziness that would transpire kind of like a hangover is way they would refer to it and then a drunkenness you can see where these two are somewhat related there's this heaviness this dizziness from this over stimulation this overburdening of the senses and then this drunkenness when it speaks of drunkenness no question this could relate to drinking something that uh causes one to be drunk in their uh they're driving while under the influence they're driving while intoxicated they're operating while under the influence of some other substance but it really is pointing to the inability to reflect or observe something maturely when someone is drunken they can't look at something and make the proper assessment because they have something else that's overwhelming their senses and they may not be able to perceive accurately the situation at hand yeah i think i could jump across that right and people do and they fall way short and it becomes a very viral video and maybe the loss of life because someone's judgment is impaired through this drunkenness and then it says not only surf fitting which is this heaviness this hangover this drunkenness but it says cares of this life there's a lot that could be said in this but it speaks of how that the anxieties about temporal things about natural things and our inordinate pursuit of them because the bible jesus deals with it elsewhere we could realize that when he refers to the cares of this life he's not just saying well you know we have this we have these needs we have to meet but pursuing them above all so our worry about them and our pursuit of them above all deadens our spiritual awareness and and weighs down in our spiritual senses because we're two too uh too bound by and distracted by being nervous and anxious to be under spiritual anticipation and expectation we're too worried being afraid to be happy to expecting we're too worried about bad things coming than being happy about good things coming so you say it's the cares of this life that have this ability to to to bow down and weigh upon a person in addition to the surf fitting the drunkenness and the cares of this life and i found where a very early early commentator uh and it was it i think even the original i found it in the greek they wrote it was in greek and then translated that it was the it's the hangover of yesterday the intoxication of today and the worry of tomorrow the surfing the drunkenness and the cares of this life he's actually been able to take things that have to do with relate to memory things that have to do with observation and things that have to do with imagination and he's taking all these different things that would be past present and future and saying you're allowing all these different things to overwhelm you and to burden you inordinately so that you're not really going to recognize the word of god when it's being fulfilled this is very very good teaching that jesus is laying down and how it kind of deals with the whole idea how we can less past present and future stupefy our senses and make the mind dull and heavy and in doing so we're unfit for the spiritual service that we're called to yes we're called to it yes we may be gifted in it yes there there's a calling you are the elect of god god has a place for you he has a position for you he has a purpose for you but we let the sorrow of the past we let the drunkenness of the day we let the worry of the future get us off center and we start acting and doing things that are not reflective of the real nature and calling that's in our lives so he says watch watch ye therefore why to not be snared watch so that you're not snared be aware be watchful i i i jesus is saying i've signaled i'm signaling something to you just as he did in the garden hey my soul is exceedingly sorrowful would you watch signal okay think about this guys has he ever said something like this before think about everything that's transpired to this point and there ought to have been some sensitivity and awareness and he even comes to the spot where he says sleep on now and take your rest can you imagine that he finally just says sleep on now and take your ass behold the hours at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me they had completely missed what was happening and as he's expressing here that they ought to watch he therefore to what to not be snared in other words be aware and be looking and know what to look for be re recognize the moment in the time that you're living in and know what to look for brother brennan makes this statement a feast of the trumpets i share this kind of just to wet your whistle a little bit and get you to ponder these things that are in the message he says we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the messiah so we've got we've got to come to a place to something that's going to introduce the messiah and how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is if there's going to be a message come to introduce the messiah how are you even going to know who the messiah is unless you're in the word to know what he looks like there has to be some sort of spiritual awareness and sensitivity that transpires within the heart of somebody to say i know there's a message that's to introduce him and i'm in the word that's going to make me know who he is so that when he makes himself known i'll recognize him and he refers to daniel 13 the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they wise shall know their god the bible says the wise shall know and understand when these books are open and these things are revealed at the end time the wise shall know and understand but the unwise and the foolish they won't get it which is the wise will they will know their god so there is going to come we're going to come to a place where there's something that's going to introduce christ but how are the people who are believing him going to know unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is and these are my words now how are they going to know unless they are in the word and awake and aware and the word is quickening them to be able to watch and see so as he expresses it in luke chapter 21 watch you therefore he says it he says that he give given them a very similar command in mark chapter 13 verses 32 to 37 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father now i i really did just want to read through these things uh so that we could just place them in the context of or just use this thing to take heed but now we realize he's talking about a time in a moment that no man knows except not even the son but the father it's the mystery of god a mystery of the father but then he says this take ye heed watch and pray because the statement nobody knows can carry with it a particular influence and he does not want the knowledge that nobody knows the hour the day or the hour not the angels in heaven nor the son but only god knows that could create a certain response so before we're even given a chance he says take ye heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is for the son of man is a as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for you know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the crowing or in the morning now it if we took it very literal to say in that literal senses he's given this the parable or this analogy of a man a master of a house going on a journey and then them not knowing when they come back and he's saying that watch he therefore because you don't know when he comes at even midnight or in the crowing or in the morning that you never sleep because you don't know when he's coming that wouldn't make sense in a physical scenario like the master's gone while he's gone just you better be hopping yourself up on goofballs because you never know when he's returning and so you just have to stimulate stimulate stimulate and never sleep until finally you know the the master comes back and you just crash that's not what that wouldn't make sense in the physical sense but he uses that analogy to kind of heighten their awareness oh yeah this is like a master leaving and you better be ready because you don't know when he's returning so everyone ought to be at their position doing what they're supposed to do and now here's the spiritual call to action for us lest coming suddenly he finds you sleeping not doing what you're supposed to be doing if your job was something that was to be done when the was crowned you better be doing it if your job was the porter to watch throughout the night at midnight you better be doing it whatever your job was you better better be at duty so he's less coming suddenly he finds you sleeping and what i say unto you i say unto all watch so his he is sharing these things and expressing these things so that we would be watchful he says in matthew chapter 25 verse 13. and again this is another example after he's even given the parable the wise and foolish virgin and he's he's now this is just a and we see that these are those are events that transpire in the the time that we're living watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh so in each one of these instances he's talking about a fulfillment of prophecy that cannot be placed upon a calendar right that you a man has not marked it and said look we know the master's coming on this day so we have all this time to do what we want to do and then it's at this moment that we ought to get everything into shape and do our chores and make things look like he wants it to be right has anybody ever done that when your parents are going to be gone look we'll be back at 11 o'clock when we get back you better make sure you have these things done and so you kind of run the math hey we've got three hours to do whatever we want because it's going to take us about 30 minutes to get this done and in doing so it kind of creates this idea of live however you want do whatever you want and then right before the time when it's going to happen that's when we're going to get everything in in in shape and in order and so this is what i found remarkable as i pondered this last week the takeaway from these statements that no man knows the hour nor the day watch ye therefore for ye neither know the day nor the hour and the son of man coming this takeaway shouldn't be well i guess we'll never know that shouldn't be our takeaway our takeaway from this is i'd rather i better be awake that that's what's the most important thing to take away from this is not this idea well you don't know when it's going to happen you really don't want it's going to happen because really you could keep using that phrase even after it happens right if somebody gets the idea well you'll never know you just never know you'll never know when the master's gonna return you never know when the master's gonna turn well did you know he's coming back today you don't know that how do you know he's here how do you know he's soon coming you don't know that you don't know the day or the hour and there could be it can even be used to kind of create this idea well i guess we'll never know but that's not the response that christ wanted us to have he is very explicit about what the response is you don't know the day of the hour so you better be awake you better be watching you better be expecting be wide awake so that if it does happen you'll see it and you'll know it it's almost as if the common response to this is to be lulled to sleep instead of waking up i'm going to make all of you yawn right now yeah nobody knows the day of the hour so i'm just going gonna take my nap whenever it should be i don't know when it's gonna be so i want to be ready i want to be looking i want to be watching i want to be i want to be under expectation now let's watch the these other scriptures as they can begin to come and view and how it really is trying to sensitize us to being wide awake it says in second peter chapter 3 verse 10 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night now this is we can see how much this harmonizes with the idea that no man's no man knoweth the day or the hour because a thief doesn't send you a text message and say hey i should be arriving tomorrow night between the hours of 11 and midnight right the the appliance repair guy gives us a heads up and says hey we're coming between nine and eleven o'clock in the morning so that you're ready to receive him well for whatever reason garage these car thieves you know petty thief don't let us know ahead of time because otherwise we kind of leave something out worth it right like look i don't have much you break into my house you're not walking off with the tv they come into my house like what what do we want is it we're in amish hoa here what is this wouldn't have much to walk out with but um this is it's it's it's harmonizing with this idea of not knowing when when he says the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night now there's a lot of things in this i would love to expound upon but i want to just touch on it very quickly a thief comes secretly and all the thieves said ah you didn't fall for it that was good a thief comes secretly he comes undetected in a way to what even will veil his appearance so that you don't know who it is it's like tom what are you doing in here stealing my tv no he covers his face he covers himself up comes secretly undetected with a purpose looking for something in particular and then afterwards what happens it brings loss after the thief has come he comes secretly undetected with the purpose afterwards there's sorrow and there's lost because something has been taken away something has happened so the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night now kind of keep this in harmony then with the day of the lord coming and watching and being expecting and waiting in revelations chapter 3 verses 2 to 3. watch this principle again be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god remember therefore how thou hast receive how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come as thee on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee now if you read that and you you absorb what's being said he's saying if you don't watch i'll come as a thief and you won't know the hour i come right if you're not watching it's going to happen and you won't know but if you're watching he says i i can't come as a thief if you're watching you will know the hour that i come upon thee so he says he says it verse two be watchful yeah there's some things that aren't right and there's things that are not perfect before me but if you'll if you'll watch and and listen to what you've heard hold fast to them repent grab a hold of the things i've shared with you and take them into your bosom and be faithful to them but if you don't watch there's going to be things happen and i'm going to come secretly undetected with a purpose and i'm going to take i'm going to do what i was asked to do and then i'm going to and i'm going to go and you're going to suffer loss because of it there's the principle now that we add to the thief in the night or not knowing the hour that he comes repeats it in revelations chapter 16 verse 15 behold and this how how this beautifully dovetails with revelations chapter 3 verse 18 wherein we're told to have i salve that we may see our garments to be a particular way and to buy this gold you see here how this is beautifully connects that we not be ashamed behold i come as a thief so the day of the lord comes as a thief in the night he says i may come on thee as a thief if you're not watching again he says behold i come as a thief now it says catch this blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments so the whole idea of him coming as a thief it has a negative consequence to those who are not awake to those who are not watching so the whole the the takeaway from behold i come as a thief is like look we're never going to know when it happens anyways so we might as well just play church until he does right one day there's going to be a resurrection of the sleeping saints and that's when we're going to get serious about this and that's when i'm going to be sure i'm going to be there i'm going to be there you bet i'm not going to miss it at all with when these meetings start again and when this happens and when that happens i'm going to be there you think so you really think you can just be lolled to sleep to the remainder of laodicea and then all of a sudden when that happens you're like is it did the arm go up is this time it's going to be too late then he says i come as a thief in the night blessed is he that watches and keepeth his garments his watchfulness allows him to abstain his watchfulness allows him to not be tore down to be defiled to be to be uh brought low to become heavier to be overcharged lest he walk naked and they see his shame this is the naked the thy shame that thy nakedness does not appear in revelations 3 18. it says where i see that symmetry of these scriptures behold i come as a thief in the night behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice there's a he's knocking there's a lot of people that never hear him why they're blind they're deaf they're not awake they can't hear so it is the bible says watch be watchful i'm coming as a thief the point is if you're not wide awake you'll miss it that's the point the point is that you know what we don't know when it's going to happen so let's all sleep if i could say this when we understand the parable of the wise and foolish virgins that's what they did but then there comes a stimulating cry to do what wake the bride up to wake the wise up so if you're going to go in you've got to be awake he's not going to drag you asleep into the wedding supper and like oh what do you know we made it it's not how it's going to work i'm going to keep going here try to do this quickly the message here ye him i i what i'd like to do is just read these if you're pulling hard enough you might just pull me right into much more on these things but i just want to read these statements so you can see how brother brown uses this language of being awake in the urgency of the time we're living in and if the day that we're living in when you see every sign moving pointing towards the coming of the lord it ought to make every minister start fasting and praying and saying god what must i do next if we are near the end time in the third seal and then recognizing your dana's message he kind of brings that same thing up about fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray but what does he say they have they haven't recognized that what they're fasting and praying for has happened so there is a sensitivity that you have for things that are yet unfulfilled to say god what must i do next because this is the urgency in the time of the hour as he uses it here in 57 it's time that we get down we got down and realized we mustn't just lust along and loaf along as if we're the carefree come easy go easy anybody living carefree spiritually it's kind of a nice area but if we're the carefree we ought not to lust along and loaf along as if we're the carefree come easy go easy we should be wide awake and it seems like that such things as today earthquake shaking even plaster dropping off the walls and buildings sending up great smoke and dust greens up like mushrooms and so forth it ought to bring us to the realization that the coming of the lord is at hand and when we see the church of the living god indifferent and infatuated with the world and lost its love of christ these things are applicable today saints these are things that we ought to be very sensitive and aware of and has become so denominational minded doesn't mean you have to be an official inc denominational minded in berries and so forth among us it ought to be milestones to let us realize that we're at the end of the road if this was so in 1957 and it ought to created an urgency what has been fulfilled and transpired for us now today to say this is the present reality of where i'm living and i can't become indifferent i can't become infatuated i can't become denominational minded i can't allow humanistic barriers to rise up to keep me from the word of god and the fellowship with other believers i need to be wide awake it says we should be wide awake not lust along loaf along come easy go easy in the message when their eyes were opened he says what if i had to walk tonight okay so i'm going to ask you to be very like focus very intently right now because what what prompted him to talk about this as well not believing in doctors or medicine or certain medical advancements and things that are available and it says i won't say what i just thought i'll share it maybe at the appropriate time because it's kind of a clever thought on never mind i don't even want to get into it but it says so if he's looking at this well you don't believe in doctors you don't believe in medicine and there's suspicion maybe or or these things that people might try to allege because he uh because he believes in divine healing but catch now pay very very focused be very very focused to pay attention to the the the things he's saying what if i had to walk tonight back home back down home what if i had to walk my home walk to my home about 600 miles away well that would be terrible right what if you had to walk home today we don't have to walk home at the very least we can use uber right or lyft i don't mean to offend anybody i don't know which camp you're in on the lyft uber side has anyone been endorsed by any particular essential oil i mean which camp which ride do we take i don't know what to do we don't have to walk home especially in this heat and this is the point he's trying to make why would you why would i walk home when i don't have to what if i went in an ox cart say why would i even use something maybe i don't have to walk but why would i even use a cart but science has produced an automobile think of this produce science has produced an automobile i thank them for it i'm very glad i accept it what if i had to wash my hands with sand like they used two years ago i didn't really know that they just used sand but i could realize maybe this agitation this is going to cause them to sand in water it's going to be rough it's going to kind of exfoliate there and clean you up he says but science has perfected soap i can clean them much better i like it brother branham's validating maybe some of the new isn't as bad as we make it out to be well then if i have to condemn the doctor i'd have to condemn the soap and have to condemn the automobile and have to condemn all those things now i want you to catch the principle though he's saying at one time i had to walk one time i had to ride an ox cart i had to walk by human propelling myself through human power then i used ox power but now i can use an automobile and then he says we used to wash ourselves one time with sand but now we have soap and so he's talking about this event advancement says so wake up now be wide awake christians look to jesus christ wake up now be real wide awake christians look to jesus christ i want to use it in this way what has god produced today what has god perfected today what has the creator produced for you today and one day this is how they worship in one day this is all they knew at one time this was all they knew they could offer this is all they knew they could amen but what has god done today if you're wide awake you may worship him in the truth of a day gone by but today i can worship him in the light of the full word being revealed because because i'm wake i woke up now i'm wide awake i haven't been lulled to sleep with the theology of a day gone by i haven't been lulled to sleep by a doctor that says all one day it will happen we don't know when we don't know how we don't know why we'll never know but one day it's gonna happen i'm wide awake to see what he's doing today because if i don't see what he's doing now i'll never see what he's doing later and i never really caught what he did before if i'm not fully awake to what he's doing right now i haven't really understood what he has done and i'll never see what he is going to do so watch ye therefore luke chapter 21 verse 36 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass watch ye therefore and to stand before the son of man let's talk about the the the language that's being used to stand before the settlement watchy therefore that you may be counted worthy to see the revelation of the son of man with joy and comfort because you're going to be kind of worthy to escape these things to stand before it speaks of a joy that speaks of a comfort to see him come in his word wherein when you see him fulfill his word in that day if they had heeded the prophecy and caught the signs of the time then they experienced a joy of deliverance they experienced the joy of comfort there is no condemnation there is no shame there is no death because i caught the revelation of the hour and in that there's joy and peace he said the snare of drunkenness and sleepiness will come upon all the people but to those who are watching to those who are wide awake they will catch the revelation of jesus christ as it applied in luke chapter 21 about the siege of jerusalem it applies to the prophecy of god in this end time that those who are wide awake are going to find joy and comfort in the revealing of jesus christ when the queen of bathsheba the queen of sheba sorry when the queen of sheba went and saw solomon and she describes everything perfectly in order everything happening she says this in first kings chapter 10 verse 8 happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom this is what the image that is brought up before us watch ye therefore that you'll be able to stand before the son of man happy are the men happy are the women happy is the bride of jesus christ that can stand before him in this hour and hear his voice and know his wisdom why because the wise shall know and understand but the foolish will not understand i'm saying happiness where are we going to find happiness standing before the son of man you get outside of that the like brightness of his countenance you get outside of that you're going to find yourself being very very uncomfortable he said well they they do it and they seem fine and they do it they're never bothered okay who are you anyways who are you what what are you confessing to be what are you made up of what's in your heart your friends could go do things and get away with it and say they're absolutely happy and then you go and do the very same thing thinking it's going to solve all the problems in your life and you find yourself married again or whatever it might be in your heart is totally tore up and like this isn't working for me this doesn't make any sense how did it work for you why did it work for you i don't know but it's the best decision i ever made and you walk away thinking i think this is this worst thing i've ever done in my life she had never moved here should have never done this shouldn't have tried that i shouldn't have done this or shouldn't have pursued this job or pursued that idea why you do it in your mind's thinking i'm trying to find happiness i'm trying to find joy and there's only one thing that's going to satisfy you and that's christ and there's no one else to blame but him he just made you that way in malachi chapter 3 verse 2 but who shall abide in the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiner's fire and the fuller soap talking about science has perfected soap there's going to be a perfecting of god's refining there's going to be a full manifestation of the word of god there's going to be a refiner's fire that takes the gold and purges it and purifies it this is malachi chapter 3 leading up to the very prophecy behold i send you elijah the prophet who will abide in the day of his coming who shall stand when he appeareth there will be those who do stand those who are watching those who are wide awake in isaiah chapter 66 verse 5 hear the word of the lord ye that trembled his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my name's sake said let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed let the lord manifest himself and when you see him it'll give you joy let the lord reveal himself let him fulfill his word let him interpret it by bringing it to pass he shall appear who shall stand when he appears to those to whom he reveals himself to he appears to your joy that this is the this is what we ought to be taken away from all of this is i want to be wide awake i want to be watching because i'm not going to find joy and being lulled to sleep i'm not going to find joy in taking a lao to see a nap i'm not going to find joy in pursuing things that sensitize this flesh i realize that i will never truly be happy and truly be free until i wake up to the horrors of my sin repent of my sin seek forgiveness find his forgiveness and stay in his path of righteousness live for him and serve him all the days of my life let the lord reveal himself and he says he shall appear to your joy when he appears you'll find joy and they will be ashamed the question and answer is on the seals i'm having to just go a little fast now and not amplify some of these things i just think i think you can see how these dots are connecting i feel that i have just some material that i won't be able to get to if the lord would inspire it there may be just another part on being wide awake but says he's asked this question and question answers on the stills my dear brother will the malachi 4 5 elijah go to the wilderness as first kings 17 tells us the other elijah did so this is the question he's asked i provided it there in green in a different font you recognize this is the question he says they're trying to ask will they just be wilderness dwellers why they'd have to go to northern british columbia to get enough wilderness to dwell in now somewhere and that's where brother branham often went to get away he says you see so it'll be someone the wilderness is all cut down there's not much wilderness left it's the only thing they might be a lover of the wilderness maybe northern bc i don't know maybe like to go hunting there or bisco he said there might be a love of the wilderness and stay maybe a lot in the wilderness you can notice the nature of them that is uncompromising and you'll know it when it comes you'll see it if you're wide awake now some people can be just awake enough to start maybe connecting these ideas and these things but he's talking about really seeing it he says you'll know it when it comes you'll see it if if you're wide awake and to see is to understand not just be able to say well brother branham is malachi 4 5 and his ministry is the ministry of elijah and be able to connect the dots and just believe what your mama says or believe what the pastor says but when you see it you'll only see it because you're wide awake and i'm not even talking about believe it there's a lot of people that believe it and then unbelieve it there's a lot of people that confess it and then disconfess it there's a lot of people that follow it but then walk away from it we're talking about you'll see it if you're wide awake and then once you're fully wide awake you're like whoa that's what i've been believing that's a lot to all this time there's no going back to sleep hallelujah once you're awake once you realize the things that have happened in this hour from that moment on there's no way for you to go back it's really an impossibility once he does it then he says in god hiding himself in simplicity this symmetry to me is so beautiful he's already told us this the rapture then judgments will strike sin plague sickness and everything the people will cry for death to take them when the judgment lord why is this judgment upon us when you said that there'd be a rapture first he'll say it's already come and you didn't know it god hiding himself in simplicity the rapture is going to be so simple so hidden like a thief in the night and let me say this that doesn't necessarily that does not mean that the bride's going to be caught unawares and you're walking you're walking to your you're just kind of walking in life not believing in much and not really knowing much and one day you're just kind of going to the refrigerator for a late night snack and you go to open the door and you're walking like what what in the world is this and you walk into a portal called it's the meeting in the air now it's not going to happen all of a sudden to the bride where she doesn't realize what's transpiring in her day the fulfillment of the word of god there'll be a moment when this sweep comes and will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but the bride's already walking in the revealed word before them so he says that it's already happened god hiding himself in simplicity it's already happened and you knew it not why don't believers believe the simple signs of his coming they're expecting all these things that spoke of by the scripture the sun going down in the day and there's going to be all kinds of things oh if we just said i got the notes wrote here on it to show what them things are and we'll get it on the breaking of these seals this week anyhow there it is just where it's already past and you didn't know it see if it is if the angel lord will break them seals forth to us remember it's sealed with them seven mysterious thunders there's something he's connecting with the rapture the judgments to come the simplicity of god and how these things are being unfolded connecting it with what's contained in these seven thunders now why can't people believe the simple simplicity of a humble bunch of people and the voice of the signs of god right you are a humble bunch of people here's your chance to pat yourself on the back you are a humble bunch of people this is a humble gathering there's humble gatherings like this all over the valley all over the world and when the world looks at it this disorganized undenominated bunch they call a cult and they say well there's just a few in number how could this even be a move of god they would have never been there in the upper room because there was just 120. right who are these people 120 people you think that's a party you think that's a group you think that's a church it's always small in number right it has nothing to do when i say small the number i'm not giving you even a number what that means it's just not so great to the world has to take notice and say all right fine we don't agree with you but you got enough money and you've got enough clout you've got enough followers to where we'll just acknowledge that you're weird and you're crazy and we'll all exist together we're not in that category there's there's nobody in this in this faith that's going to be able to be a a presidential nominee if you get what i'm saying why can't they believe it just like it's always been the true word of god being made manifest they're too smart and too educated to believe the simple form of the written word they want to put their own interpretation to it it don't mean this it don't mean that the prophet it does mean that listen may i say this right quick now even the visions of god gives here at the place it's so misunderstood that's the reason why you hear on the tape say say what the tapes say say what the vision's saying last night some of the brothers from jerusalem were talking about how brother branham said from tucson i see i'm still doing it now they're from tucson from jerusalem tabernacle and said brother braham said you worship in jerusalem right because that's what the tapes say and i just pointed out brother braham said those who live in phoenix live closer to god so you worship where you want i want to live close to god i want to live close but those living in phoenix live closest to god and i said we just say what the tape saying he says say what the vision said he says now if you're wide awake you'll see something think about all these things he's saying and all these things he's pointing to all these different elements of rapture and judgment and seven thunders and the seals being opened and god interpreted his word and people saying it doesn't mean this it doesn't mean that he says it does mean this and all these different things happening he comes all the way down to say these things have been misunderstood listen to what i'm preaching to you listen to what i'm saying and he says it this way if you're wide awake you'll see something and if you're not wide awake you'll imagine a lot if you're not wide awake you'll interpret a lot of things you'll assume a lot of things it doesn't mean if you're white not wide awake you won't have any theology you won't have any doctrines you won't have any ideas you'll still have a lot of them and a lot of convictions and a lot of passion they're saying if you really want to see something you've got to be wide awake now if you're wide awake you'll see something he says if you you'll see it if you're wide awake so now twice within a week of each other in almost exactly a week he is making this pronouncement if you're wide awake he says i hope i don't have to hold it in my hand to show you i don't even know what he was referring to there i hope i don't have to hold it in my hand to show you you mean brother branham there was enough vindication there was enough solid evidence there was enough behind what you're now expressing and beginning to express that week to where you felt as if you could show them in your hand do i have to hold it in my hand to show you it is here these very things that people miss these very things that people are speculating about he said something is upon us something it's here we're at the end yes there are smart will miss it the simple visions when they're revealed in such simplicity till it just crosses over the top of people's head goes right over their head and we use that to express how someone maybe doesn't have a sense of humor or they don't they don't really pick up on it they don't catch it says oh that went over my head but it could just be this inability to catch something to recognize something happen they're clueless they're oblivious they don't know it goes right over their heads because they're off looking out somewhere for something really really big something really really great he says it's happening right underneath you happening right in front of you if you're wide awake you'll see something as these thoughts and these these inspirations were coming to me and this thought of our joy being connected with these things these very specific things that we referenced last time in out of nehemiah and this time today i felt like there was this paradox and that well you have to be wide awake to see it but then how do you how do you wake up and it was almost like well what what wakes you up is what you want to see and i felt like well there has to be a way there has to be a way that these things will kind of click together these gears will kind of click together to help the people to understand what how the these order of things because i feel like we're all we're walking in this together and and there's and there's different ones who have been faithful to this message much longer than i have and have a better understanding of the word than i do and and even and and certainly gifted men that preach it in a more dynamic way in a more positive way than i can but then i would realize that i would i would want to be received and accepted as a brother who's not way out somewhere you know lulled to sleep and in some kind of fantasy or some kind of false doctrine but to realize that i'm i'm walking in steps that they once walked in that those who are ahead of me i'm looking to them and they're furthering the word and i can look back and see others who are coming along and we realize we're kind of all in this together and if there's somebody who's wide awake because they're wide awake they're seeing something but i'm just waking up so maybe i'm seeing something a little bit different and there's others that still need to be woke up yet but if we could all kind of be in harmony of what it takes to wake us up and what we need to see when we wake up we can stay in harmony know that something is happening and so in the third seal brother bram's talking about how the denominations take their revival and they've had their revival but they're dead he's talking about the church being that he's even talking about the church as it relates to god's product his work product the church he's raised up to the ages that in the lail to see in church age she's dead spiritually dead he says now that's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir it's five in there don't think we got revivals we haven't brother brahma is even going so far as to say that the things that have transpired in the things that have happened has not been in the in his ministry even since 1933 the things that have been taking place in his ministry is not the revival that he's talking about he says oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but no revival nowhere no no so now we have six seven no revivals the bride hasn't had a revival yet all right i am only saying what he said on march 20th 1963. okay i'm not using that present tense today to say the bride hasn't had her revival yet because there's bride here that would just say would say brother aaron and you're missing it then amen bride if i tried to use this quote today to say the bride hasn't had her revival i would accept the i would expect the bride to meet me outside and say brother aaron i'm sorry but i'm taking mine now because that's the reality of it he said in this moment here the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of god disturb the bride denominational revivals won't stir her weekend revivals don't stir her church camps and church moves don't don't stir her don't revive her it takes a manifestation of god to stir the bride she can come to a place of restoration where she looks like an army but there's gotta come a move of god that induce her with power and she rises onto her feet as an invincible army it takes a manifestation of god it takes the fourth life messenger it takes the revealing of jesus christ to stir the bride and to wake her up he says it in those very words we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it this is brother aaron now said amen he sent it this day this scripture is fulfilled the bride's revival is here why because he continues to preach that week we know that it was the manifestation of god it was the loosen of those seven seals it was the revealing of those seven unknown thunders and that's the bride's revival and he says that's what wakes her up so there's no other means to wake you up i think this is the part to me where it's not necessarily circular reasoning it's just the reality if you're slumbering and you're sleepy and you're and you're over charged and you're groggy you'll miss what god's doing today and the only thing that's going to wake you up to see what god is doing is what god is doing you can't go to the doctor and get a prescription for this you can't go into the world and find the answer for this the only thing that can wake you up the only thing that can relieve you of the spiritual amnesia the only thing that can give you it puts you in this position to begin to see something he says if you're wide awake you'll see something the only thing that can wake you up is the manifestation of god through the open of the word that's what has to stir you and wake you up so then if you're listening to this if we are now in the the gethsemane time if we're at the very nearing the end of our journey in this message and we're coming to this climax of a rapture and a body change then the word is to wake up to watch therefore to tarry to be mindful to be alert to to recognize your day and its message and if you find yourself well i i feel like i believe and i feel like this but i've got this spiritual lethargy and i'm being lulled to sleep then you have to say wait a minute oh god i've got to run back to the word i've got to come to christ i've got to feed on his principles i've got to seek his face i said god forgive me of my sins forgive me my laziness lord i feel that i'm being overcharged i feel like i'm becoming drunk oh god let your word wake me up and get back into this word of god you should be taking time praying reading listening oh desiring it because it'll be that word that wakes you up and then i just shouldn't see a revival saying oh my goodness i've been in this message for 33 years and i've never seen this oh my goodness i've been preaching this for years i've been living this for years i've loved this for years but now i feel like i'm more awake than i've ever been can i get an amen anybody live that way anybody find that this is true to this that we can be woke up to see more that god is doing because once these seven thunders make you wide awake you'll start seeing something once you catch that what happened and when brother man preached the seven seals brother brown just didn't get up there preach the seven seals and say now all right i preached it don't be mysterious don't interpret these things if you can just forget i even preached it and let's just go be simple christians and move on and that's what we want to do is we just kind of want to forget that week you're still asleep if you can have the conviction and the attitude that god sent a prophet and that what he said mattered right and and you say well what year did he preach it in the years that he was a prophet and what he preached mattered and that he said things that were really strange and mysterious causes people to stumble some to walk away some to ponder on it but you start realizing that god sent it for a purpose and he sent it for a reason and it wasn't so that men could build kingdoms and abuse people he didn't do it so men could get rich and so people could have authority and people could bind people to he sent a message of grace to his bride to the church to christians and you are those who've received it and you should receive it as your own and you should take it and begin to examine it in its purity without interpretation without men's ideas with not without the memories of what it was and what it had become when you were raised in it but begin to look at it as lord this is truth and i know it's truth and i want to receive it in the spirit that it was given i share that because a brother shared with me he recently just dropped in my heart to say it he was raised in this message believed it fervently and adamantly and even to the point where every single word was thus saith the lord and everything was perfect and he got really really challenged in the core of it one time and he said he convinced him he knew he was brought to a place of decision with god and he said i know i know i believe it but i haven't received it in the spirit that it was given and he went back and started all over and says this time i want to receive it in the spirit that it was given and you'll find that it's not the spirit of william branham that you catch when you do that it's christ once this word wakes you up that's when you can start to see things and that'll be your joy you wanna know where your pure joy is if you were hoping to get some couch time with brother aaron and sister elizabeth in other words you could lay down on the couch and we could be your psychiatrist and we can help you find your joy that's not where you'll find it we'll make ourselves available maybe to some degree allow you to take advantage of us in taking our time to counsel you even we spend hours counseling people that don't even aren't even a part of our church because they hear there's an opportunity there's someone available there's there's a heart open to hear and to help we're willing to do it i'll be glad i'll be glad to spend and be spent for you but at the end of the day i know that for the elect this word is their joy this is where you'll find it maybe maybe maybe god knows this would be where we'll end this thought but there's still more that brother ram talks about waking up and i think that's maybe all we need to do is just wake up a little bit more let's stand maybe christ can still give a gentle rebuke today and say your spirit is willing but the flesh is weak we say lord just strengthen my hands for war i want to be that overcomer lord help me lord we could just bow our heads i'd like to pray with you if you need a touch from the lord today i believe that you can receive it right where you stand i realize for others that they desire they need in in no disrespect no lack of faith they need another point of contact and we want you to know that there's you're always welcome to come forward for prayer if you need prayer but i do believe today that he has spoken very particularly to you and your needs and your situation and maybe you've grown cold and you've grown numb and you've grown calloused and your heart has become hardened towards certain things and the preaching of the word it's almost as if it's doing these chest compressions it's bringing you back you have enough consciousness today to say lord touch me help me lord today [Music] help me father wake me up lord if i'm asleep lord wake me up lord if it takes a revelation of your word to give me my stirring and i haven't had it lord stir me lead me to it just as that woman at the well would have never known that day when she showed up that there'd be a man there and tell him who she was tell her who she was not just who he was maybe today you could sense this moment that you can receive i pray lord that you'd grant us something special today now our heads bowed we need something in prayer maybe you just lift your hands before the lord lift your hands to him now our gracious heavenly father we lift hands and surrender to you lord we're desirous to be wide awake christians we desire as the word teaches us to be sane and sensible we understand lord that to the world will be considered fanatics even as the definition is a fanatic is someone that loves jesus more than you so we realized that yes to the world we're crazy and we're fanatical and we're irrational but lord we cannot induce some sort of emotional frenzy and some irrational exuberance and just be some sort of wildfire that's not connected with revelation and not connected with the fulfilling of your word and then feel as if we're because we're message cell it's because we're zealous for brother branham and we're zealous for the tapes and zealots for the books that were that were right lord we must be sensible according to your word we must be sane we must be sober we must be in our right minds so lord i pray today that you would help us to recover from any inappropriate intoxication recover from any carnal stimulation and lord sober our spirits up and wake us up lord that being wide awake we can now be stimulated with the stimulation of revelation that there be no improper stimulants mixed in between but it would be pure it would be clean it would be sober it would be serious yet full of the joy of the lord and i pray for those with broken hearts that you would heal them lord for people in situations that are complicated may you bring a resolution to the paradox lord may you even breathe bring this understanding that if we repent and ask forgiveness of our sins we can still find grace in your sight and you can allow us to navigate difficult situations and find a peace in the midst of the storm and find a perfection in the midst of broken pieces so i pray lord today right now that you would heal that you would mend that you would lead that you had guide that you would bring a total deliverance and a peace lord as i pray now before you sister karen pruitt comes upon my heart lord i pray that you would completely mend and restore a total restoration to remove this bleeding and this pressure resolve whatever this may be and may this last one be the last time that she suffers from this malady and may she be brought back to good health now today lord may she be made well we're asking for it lord and i pray for your mercy and grace upon your people and may we receive you now by faith in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
