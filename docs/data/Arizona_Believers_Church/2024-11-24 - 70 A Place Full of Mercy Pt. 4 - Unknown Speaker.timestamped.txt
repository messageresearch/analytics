[0:00] continuing on the subject of a Place
[0:03] full of Mercy this is part four I'm
[0:06] hoping just to wrap up this portion
[0:08] today Lord willing on Sunday when we
[0:11] pick up I'd like to maybe get into the
[0:13] voice of Mercy that's my working title
[0:16] for the next four services but today A
[0:18] Place full of mercy and I'm looking at
[0:22] it from the standpoint of how brother
[0:24] brandom uses this exact phrase judgment
[0:26] is striking and so judgment is striking
[0:29] even uh is very particular about certain
[0:31] events that were transpiring that was
[0:33] showing judgment that was striking and
[0:35] he said judgment is at hand and there's
[0:38] a lot of uh significant aspects of
[0:40] judgment and this finality of things and
[0:43] the tribulation that's coming on uh we
[0:46] know that the bride will not suffer
[0:47] tribulation but yet there can be
[0:49] judgment that's falling upon Nations and
[0:51] upon people and during this terrible
[0:54] time that we're living in and where we
[0:56] could see scriptural things taking place
[0:58] that would cause us to pause and wonder
[1:00] well what does this mean for our loved
[1:02] ones what does this mean for Sinners
[1:04] even cause a prophet to preach could it
[1:06] be that no one can be saved now uh we
[1:09] realize that that's because of the
[1:10] significance of the events that had
[1:12] transpired that year when he preaches
[1:14] Souls that are in prison now and we
[1:16] realize that though this judgment is
[1:18] striking and we're living in a time of
[1:20] judgment yet there is still mercy and I
[1:23] believe that with all of my heart and I
[1:26] would ask today as you normally do just
[1:28] uh Focus I know we all May have turkey
[1:30] on our mind and all the events of this
[1:32] coming week but Focus because I'm going
[1:34] to use a lot of
[1:35] scripture and I hope that you can absorb
[1:39] it and that you could make the
[1:41] connections in your heart or ask God to
[1:43] make these connections for you there's a
[1:45] lot of scriptures I'd like to read where
[1:47] normally what I think I would do or want
[1:49] to do is take that scripture and then
[1:52] add in other scriptures to support that
[1:55] and statements from the message of the
[1:56] hour to where you know in that self
[1:58] maybe it would just be a but I want to
[2:00] read a lot scripture today to where I'm
[2:02] hoping that you in your hearts could uh
[2:05] consider are these things that are
[2:07] taking place in the day and age we're
[2:09] living in now are these things
[2:10] transpiring now and uh so instead of
[2:13] maybe building it out as I would
[2:14] normally like to I'm just going to cover
[2:16] a lot of scripture and hope that God Can
[2:19] Make It Real to you in Romans chapter 3:
[2:23] 22-2 I'm just hitting rewind a little
[2:25] bit to cover a little bit from Wednesday
[2:28] and Paul says even the righteous of God
[2:30] which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
[2:32] all and upon all them that believe so
[2:36] there he must have faith he says for
[2:37] there is no difference for all have
[2:40] sinned and come short of the glory of
[2:42] God being justified freely by his grace
[2:45] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[2:46] Jesus whom God hath set forth so Jesus
[2:50] Christ has been set forth to be a
[2:53] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[2:55] to declare his righteousness for the
[2:57] remission of sins that are passed
[2:59] through the forbear erance of God as
[3:01] Paul typically does that's a mouthful
[3:04] but the part I'm wanting just to ex
[3:06] Express or zero in on is that God has
[3:08] declared Jesus Christ as The Mercy Seat
[3:12] now in the temple in the Tabernacle
[3:14] there was a place in the most holy place
[3:16] the holiest of holies and there the
[3:19] presence of God dwelt between the
[3:20] cherubims which is that plate that lid
[3:23] of perpetuation that was set upon the
[3:25] ark the ark containing certain
[3:27] instruments um and things inside of it
[3:30] and all of it together represents this
[3:32] Dwelling Place of God the Tabernacle the
[3:34] secret place and this lid of
[3:37] perpetuation which is called The Mercy
[3:39] Seat made of gold and overlaid over wood
[3:42] this he says now is Christ has been set
[3:45] forth and declared to be The Mercy Seat
[3:48] the place of reconciliation the place
[3:50] that we find God's presence the place
[3:52] that we find Mercy and this Mercy that
[3:57] he is set forth to be declared we can
[3:59] say that Mercy came in the form of Jesus
[4:01] Christ as God showing Mercy offered
[4:03] Jesus Christ as a substitute we've said
[4:05] this the last few Services what a
[4:07] paradox we were subject to judgment God
[4:09] showed us Mercy by having his son put to
[4:12] death and it wouldn't seem to be too
[4:14] merciful to Christ but yet he has set
[4:16] forth as our atonement and our
[4:18] substitute so Christ is The Mercy Seat
[4:23] then in first Timothy chap 1 I want to
[4:25] read these two verses 13 and 16 Paul
[4:28] speaking of himself said who was before
[4:30] who was before a blasphemer and a
[4:32] persecutor and injures this is Paul the
[4:35] chief chiefest of Sinners he was a
[4:37] blasphemer a persecutor inous he was a
[4:39] murderer but I obtained Mercy it's a
[4:42] phrase that's used in the New Testament
[4:44] obtaining Mercy I want uh to say this if
[4:47] I haven't emphasized it yet very clearly
[4:50] that this Mercy that you obtain isn't
[4:52] necessarily incidental nor is it
[4:54] something that comes and goes you've
[4:55] obtained it you're the beneficiary of it
[4:57] it's done you've got it
[5:00] you are the bear you are the recipient
[5:02] you've obtained mercy and you can't lose
[5:04] it so for this cause have I he says I
[5:06] obtained Mercy because I did it
[5:08] ignorantly in unbelief it's quite a
[5:11] statement I obtained Mercy because in my
[5:15] ignorance I did these things and it's
[5:18] this image then of him being ignorant in
[5:21] unbelief and that's uh I think that's
[5:24] critical to think about what unbelief is
[5:27] and so Paul was in unbelief but yet he
[5:29] obtained mercy so in his ignorance
[5:32] through unbelief but yet he did these
[5:35] things but now he's obtained mercy and
[5:36] he comes to verse 16 he says how be it
[5:39] for this cause I obtained mercy so Paul
[5:42] is not just saying well I got Mercy
[5:44] because I was ignorant he said but God
[5:46] wanted to do something he says that in
[5:48] me first Christ Jesus Christ might show
[5:51] forth all
[5:52] longsuffering for a pattern to them
[5:54] which should believe
[5:55] Hereafter to them which should Hereafter
[5:58] believe on him to everlasting life I
[6:02] sinned in ignorance but I obtained mercy
[6:05] and God wanted to declare through my
[6:08] testimony and my experience how that he
[6:10] would show longsuffering and he would
[6:13] Grant mercy and give Mercy to them who
[6:15] also believe despite their ignorance and
[6:18] despite their sin so God used Paul and
[6:21] is using Paul as an example of how Mercy
[6:24] works and how Mercy work going from
[6:27] ignorance to truth that if there's a
[6:29] truth if there's a reality you
[6:31] disbelieved it or you didn't know it you
[6:33] sinned you were doing contrary to the
[6:34] word of God and we could say in the
[6:36] strictest sense that all have sinned and
[6:38] fallen short of the glory of God
[6:40] therefore being subject to the penalty
[6:41] of sin which is death then we're all
[6:43] guilty but Mercy covers that guilt and
[6:47] mercy it says wow you are were now that
[6:50] you have believed I exempt you now that
[6:52] you have believed upon the perpetuation
[6:54] Christ then you obtain mercy so it's a
[6:57] great example to us and he says he did
[7:00] it ignorantly in unbelief these things
[7:02] that he did and in James 4:1 17 says
[7:06] therefore to him that knoweth to do good
[7:08] and doeth it not to him it is sin to him
[7:12] that
[7:13] knows to do good and doesn't do it to
[7:16] him it is sin something to think about
[7:18] for ourselves sometimes we look at
[7:20] somebody say Well they're nothing but a
[7:21] sinner because they're doing something
[7:23] that you know they shouldn't
[7:25] do but to them that sin that knows to do
[7:29] good and doesn't do it to him it is sin
[7:32] so sin is knowing and not doing
[7:34] therefore we could say sin is
[7:36] unbelief because anything the Bible says
[7:39] anything that is not of faith is sin all
[7:41] unrighteousness is sin so we see these
[7:43] things in the scripture and that to
[7:46] disbelieve the word of God unbelief is
[7:48] sin and these other things are
[7:50] attributes of sin and brother brandham
[7:53] when we were looking at these things on
[7:55] Wednesday he speaks of how when truth is
[7:57] presented to a person for the last time
[7:59] and the refuse to receive it they are
[8:01] finished and this is this is the thought
[8:03] of if truth is presented then you're no
[8:05] longer ignorant then you just choose to
[8:08] not believe or accept what the truth is
[8:09] telling you or you just willfully choose
[8:12] not to obey the truth and it says when a
[8:15] person does that for the last time then
[8:17] they're finished there can be no more
[8:18] Mercy to someone who refuses truth and I
[8:21] hope that's been clear in scripture how
[8:23] that mercy and Truth are met together in
[8:25] our atonement and mercy and Truth are
[8:27] met together in Christ Jesus so you
[8:29] reject Christ not only you're rejecting
[8:31] truth you're rejecting
[8:33] mercy so we're wanting to continue along
[8:36] these lines how that Mercy is available
[8:38] despite judgment but it's only found in
[8:40] one place just because there's Mercy
[8:43] doesn't mean you're going to be able to
[8:44] find it willy-nilly
[8:46] but Mercy is found in one place and I
[8:48] can say even if Mercy is over in one
[8:51] sense or in one place there can still be
[8:54] Mercy in another place just as The Mercy
[8:57] Seat moved in the Old Testament and as
[8:59] the Mercy Seat was declared to be vacant
[9:01] in the Tabernacle that day or in the
[9:03] temple that day and hanging upon a cross
[9:05] the same can be so where God declares
[9:07] that a system is over dispensation is
[9:10] over and now you've got to come to God's
[9:12] provided place to find his
[9:15] Mercy now this these next several
[9:17] scriptures we're going to use and I
[9:18] think for the most part most of the
[9:20] scriptures we use will track along these
[9:22] lines is showing how that God in a time
[9:24] of judgment there's still this aspect of
[9:27] Mercy in Psalm 76 : 7 to2 says Thou even
[9:31] Thou Art to be feared and who may stand
[9:34] in thy sight when Once Thou Art
[9:37] angry now this is about God thou didst
[9:40] cause judgment to be heard from Heaven
[9:43] the Earth feared and was still when God
[9:46] arose to judgment to save all the meek
[9:49] of the earth say law so now there's this
[9:51] declaration of how fearful it is when
[9:53] God is angry that he causes judgment to
[9:56] be heard from heaven so there's this
[9:58] voice that comes down and the Earth
[10:00] fears and then it's still it it obeys
[10:03] the voice of God so God when God arises
[10:05] to judgment when God arose to judgment
[10:08] now think of these terms he's arising to
[10:11] judge to save so it's just it's right
[10:14] there in the same sentence when God
[10:15] arose to judgment to save all the meek
[10:18] of the earth verse 10 surely the wrath
[10:21] of man shall praise thee the remainder
[10:23] of Wrath shall Thou shalt wrath shalt
[10:26] thou restrain so there's wrath there's
[10:28] judgment the remainder there's some
[10:30] restraint so he comes to judge but yet
[10:32] save vow and pay unto the Lord your God
[10:35] let all that be round about him bring
[10:37] presence unto him that ought to be
[10:39] feared he shall cut off the spirit of
[10:42] princes he is terrible to the kings of
[10:45] the Earth or as we like to say he's
[10:47] turble to the kings of the earth so we
[10:51] could look at this scripture that God in
[10:53] a time of judgment as God Rises to judge
[10:55] he's also through his judgment going to
[10:58] save the meek of the Earth so despite
[10:59] his wrath God will have mercy on his
[11:02] people and they will praise him that's
[11:04] what the scripture saying he's angry
[11:06] he's coming to to to judge but he will
[11:09] have mercy on his people therefore they
[11:11] will give this vow of praise and they
[11:12] will offer praise if I could say this
[11:15] they may be uh deserving of Wrath but
[11:18] they're not appointed to it they may be
[11:21] guilty of sin and all of sin and fallen
[11:23] short of the glory of God but he has not
[11:25] destined them to wrath job looked at it
[11:28] this way job 14:13 oh thou would that
[11:32] thou would has hided me in the grave
[11:35] thou wouldest that thou wouldest Keep Me
[11:37] In Secret this is the the Declaration of
[11:40] a an Earthly man a carnal man he says
[11:42] hide me in the grave or keep me in
[11:45] secret until thy wrath be passed amen so
[11:49] there's wrath and there's this judgment
[11:51] the things are coming well hide me
[11:52] secure me keep me from your wrath that
[11:55] thou wouldest appoint me a set time and
[11:57] remember me I what a great statement and
[12:00] say well if your judgment's coming and
[12:02] there's going to be a judgment would you
[12:03] just hide me in a secret place would you
[12:06] appoint me a special time where you
[12:08] would remember me that if you would hide
[12:12] me keep me from your wrath but don't
[12:13] forget me Appo A Time To Remember Me In
[12:18] Isaiah 121:2 it says and in that day
[12:20] Thou shalt say oh Lord I will praise
[12:23] thee though thou was angry with me thy
[12:27] anger is turned away and thou comforted
[12:29] this me what a what a difference in
[12:32] Anger to comfort and remember this
[12:35] phrase he's angry but I received Comfort
[12:38] he there was this wrath there was this
[12:40] indignation there he God arose to
[12:43] judgment but he saved the meek of the
[12:45] earth you were angry but your angers
[12:47] turned away and you comforted me behold
[12:49] God is my salvation I will trust and not
[12:52] be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my
[12:54] strength and my song he also is become
[12:58] my salvation he is our Salvation we're
[13:02] not just saved but he by him but he is
[13:05] our Salvation this even speaks to the
[13:07] Salvation that's going to be revealed in
[13:09] the end time the revelation of Jesus
[13:12] Christ that comes a and is that Capstone
[13:15] this is he has become our Salvation this
[13:18] grace that is brought to us this
[13:20] salvation to be revealed in the end he's
[13:23] angry but it's turned away and his
[13:25] despite the anger it's
[13:27] Comfort the Bible says this in Isaiah 34
[13:30] and then also later in chapter 63 Isaiah
[13:34] 348 for it is the day of the Lord's
[13:36] Vengeance that's a wrathful time it's a
[13:38] terrible time it's a uh tempestuous and
[13:41] it's fiery flames of judgment and the
[13:43] year of recompenses for the controversy
[13:46] of Zion so a day of the Lord's Vengeance
[13:49] and the year of recompenses for the
[13:51] controversy of Zion if we were to drill
[13:54] down on this in great depth it's God
[13:57] liberating Zion of her enemies
[13:59] God silencing her critics for this
[14:01] controversy of Zion the dispute The
[14:04] Strife of Zion there's going to be a
[14:06] reward for The Strife of Zion in this
[14:09] day of Vengeance we could look at this
[14:10] scripture day of Vengeance a year of
[14:12] recompense it's judgment for some reward
[14:14] for others this year of recompenses we
[14:17] can say that in this time of judgment
[14:19] this day of the Lord's Vengeance it's
[14:21] punishment and Dread for one group of
[14:23] people but Vindication and glory for
[14:26] another it says it this way in Isaiah 6
[14:29] 3:4 for the day of vengeance is in Mine
[14:31] Heart it's in his heart it's day of
[14:34] Vengeance the time has come it's time
[14:35] for wrath time for judgment time for
[14:38] separation time to uh to take those that
[14:41] are going to be judged and gather them
[14:43] together and the year of my redeemed is
[14:46] come now that's quite uh it's quite a
[14:50] combination of things the day of
[14:52] Vengeance the day of Judgment Day of
[14:54] Wrath but then at the same time the year
[14:56] of my redeemed has come the year of my
[14:59] redeemed this time of perfection it's a
[15:01] time of fullness a time of completion to
[15:04] be redeemed it's it's this fullness to
[15:06] recompense as it read earlier it means
[15:08] to reward those that are in this
[15:11] Covenant of Peace means to be at peace
[15:13] means to complete or finish to
[15:15] recompense to finish to complete it
[15:17] speaks of a covenant of peace to plate
[15:20] to reward judgments being pronounced and
[15:23] Redemption is being finished I want you
[15:25] to catch this in the scripture how that
[15:28] it's a day of vengeance so judgment is
[15:29] being pronounced judgment is at hand but
[15:32] Redemption is being
[15:33] completed God is bringing Full
[15:36] Redemption and so we could say if God's
[15:38] bringing Full Redemption there's no more
[15:40] Hal truth there's nothing in part
[15:42] there's nothing missing there's no
[15:43] excuses God has paid the price of
[15:45] redemption now God is completing and
[15:47] finishing Redemption it's a time of full
[15:50] Redemption and instead of looking at it
[15:53] maybe this way well God's judging so
[15:55] there's protection for these look at it
[15:57] this way God is bringing the fullness of
[16:00] redemption God is going to complete his
[16:03] cycle God is going to finish up
[16:05] everything that he started and so in the
[16:07] finality that's where you need to be
[16:10] because if you're not there you're left
[16:11] out of his Plan of Redemption and it not
[16:14] being in his Plan of Redemption all
[16:15] that's left for you is Judgment so it's
[16:19] not that judgment is necessarily his
[16:21] goal or his focus in that moment well
[16:23] I'm just going to come to judge and you
[16:24] guys just sit still while I judge
[16:26] everybody it's more that I've come to f
[16:28] finish my Redemption and in finishing my
[16:31] Redemption you must be a part of this or
[16:34] you're going to be left out of
[16:35] redemption
[16:37] amen so it's a special uh special
[16:40] dispensation and if it's a time for full
[16:44] Redemption it's redeeming time it's a
[16:47] it's time for Redemption then there's a
[16:50] an end of
[16:53] mediating it's an there's an end to
[16:56] interceding now I know those are phrases
[16:58] that get people thinking oh
[17:00] boy where is he
[17:04] going well you'll know soon
[17:09] enough not going anywhere other than
[17:11] where I believe the prophet taught so
[17:14] there's just I don't think there's any
[17:15] reason to get weird with it but we do
[17:18] need to look at these things with some
[17:20] serious consideration the day of
[17:22] Vengeance day of Wrath a day of judgment
[17:24] but a day of redemption the fullness of
[17:27] redemption it's redeeming time it's a
[17:28] complete
[17:29] of redemption in Psalms 102 I like to
[17:32] read verses 1 to verse 20 I wanted I
[17:35] thought about chopping this in half but
[17:37] I thought if we just read through this
[17:38] whole thing we'll get the full picture
[17:40] of this groaning and this crying out
[17:43] from the heart of this Afflicted a
[17:44] prayer of The Afflicted who is
[17:46] overwhelmed and porth out his complaint
[17:48] before the Lord hear my prayer O Lord
[17:50] and let me cry Let My Cry come unto thee
[17:53] in the cry in The Exodus God said that I
[17:56] am come down for the cries of my people
[17:58] reached un heaven and I've come down to
[18:00] deliver them here yet again a cry is
[18:03] offered up to heaven hide not thy face
[18:05] from me in the day when I am in trouble
[18:07] incline thine ear unto me in the day
[18:10] when I call answer me speedily come to
[18:13] my defense come to my Aid and Jesus when
[18:15] he gives the parable of the unrighteous
[18:17] judge who avenged the Widow who wearied
[18:20] him he says I will avenge the elect
[18:22] speedily but will I find faith in that
[18:24] time is his question for my days are
[18:27] consumed like smoke and my my bones are
[18:29] burned as a hear my heart is smitten and
[18:32] withered like grass so that I forget to
[18:34] eat my
[18:35] bread I know what that's like my reason
[18:39] of the voice of my groaning my bones
[18:41] cleave to my skin I'm like a pelican of
[18:43] the Wilderness I'm like an owl of the
[18:44] desert I watch and am as a sparrow alone
[18:47] upon the Housetop my enemies reproach me
[18:50] all the day and they that are mad
[18:52] against me are sworn against me my
[18:55] enemies Compass themselves round about
[18:57] me
[18:58] for I have eaten ashes like bread and
[19:00] mingled my drink with weeping because of
[19:02] thine indignation and thine wrath for
[19:04] thou Hast Lifted Me Up and cast me down
[19:07] my days are like a shadow that Decline
[19:09] and I'm withered like grass though
[19:11] there's the
[19:13] Lamentations but thou oh Lord shalt
[19:16] endure forever in thy remembrance unto
[19:18] all generations Thou shalt
[19:21] arise remember as the Bible said in
[19:24] Psalm it says when God arose to judgment
[19:27] he's rising to judge he's going going to
[19:28] have wrath to cut the spirit of the
[19:30] princes he's going to be terrible to the
[19:32] kings of the earth he's going to pour
[19:34] out his judgment he's going to pour out
[19:36] his wrath but Thou shalt arise and have
[19:39] mercy upon Zion for the time to favor
[19:42] her yay the set time has come it's even
[19:45] akin to the prayer of job we said oh
[19:47] that you would just hide me in this time
[19:49] of trouble and appoint a time where
[19:51] you'll show me favor that thou wouldest
[19:53] remember me he says I will arise and
[19:55] have mercy for the time to show her
[19:57] grace yay the set time to favor her is
[19:59] come for thy servants take pleasure in
[20:02] her stones and favor the dust thereof
[20:04] she is in shambles she is torn down she
[20:07] has been laid in Ruins when the Lord
[20:11] shall build up Zion he shall appear in
[20:14] his glory think of this great image of
[20:16] the the bride being built up the bride
[20:19] will come in preview again the Lord
[20:21] shall build up Zion brother Brandon
[20:23] Place said in one place Zion is the
[20:25] bride there's this spiritual image of
[20:27] the Bride the New Jerusalem and God is
[20:29] going to restore her he's going to build
[20:31] her up and when he does he's going to
[20:33] appear in his glory and the woman is the
[20:36] glory of the man the bride is the glory
[20:38] of the son of man he's going to appear
[20:40] in his glory when he she he builds up
[20:42] Zion when the time comes to have mercy
[20:45] on Zion he will regard the prayer of the
[20:48] destitute and not despise their prayer
[20:50] this shall be written for the generation
[20:52] to come and the people which shall be
[20:55] created shall praise the Lord this is
[20:57] that Gentile how bride the New Creations
[21:00] a new race a super race a super people
[21:03] and this time when he builds up Zion and
[21:05] he appears in his glory for Heath looked
[21:07] down from the height of his Sanctuary
[21:09] from Heaven did the Lord behold the
[21:11] Earth to hear the groaning of the
[21:13] prisoner to loose those that are
[21:15] appointed to death what tremendous
[21:18] Prophecy of the end time that he has
[21:20] looked down from the heights of Heaven
[21:21] and the Lord himself will descend and he
[21:24] puts one foot on land one foot on sea
[21:26] and he's making a declaration to Lo
[21:29] those that are appointed to death he
[21:32] hears the groaning of the prisoners Paul
[21:34] said we who are in this body do grown
[21:36] wanting to be what
[21:39] liberated he'll hear the groaning of the
[21:41] prisoner and loose those that are
[21:43] appointed to death so it's not that we
[21:46] don't deserve death it's not that we
[21:47] don't deserve wrath but we're not
[21:49] appointed to it in Hebrews 927 and 28 as
[21:54] it is appointed unto men once to die but
[21:56] after this judgment you can say that's
[21:58] that's the general
[22:00] rule it's appointed a men once to die
[22:03] but after this judgment we know that we
[22:05] say there's two things that are certain
[22:06] death and taxes well guess what some
[22:08] don't pay taxes so there's two things
[22:11] that are certain death and judgment but
[22:15] I like to throw that in there because it
[22:17] says so Christ was once offered to Bear
[22:18] the sins of many why because all have
[22:22] sinned and fallen short of the glory of
[22:23] God so as it is appointed unto men once
[22:26] to die and then after that judgment
[22:28] Christ Christ was offered to Bear the
[22:29] sins of many that they would no longer
[22:32] face judgment but they passed from Death
[22:34] un life and would not come into the
[22:36] Judgment that's what the atonement was
[22:39] for he says and unto them that look for
[22:42] him shall he appear the second time
[22:44] without sin unto salvation it's a
[22:48] prophecy of him coming in the end time
[22:50] that Christ came one time and paid the
[22:54] price the atonement to Bear the sins of
[22:56] many and because of that you will not
[22:58] come into judgment but yet there's still
[23:01] disappointment with death and so to them
[23:04] that look for him shall he appear the
[23:06] second time not to address sin which
[23:09] makes us subject to judgment but for
[23:11] salvation from Death Or if I could say
[23:13] this the Salvation to be revealed in the
[23:15] end to cause us to triumph over even
[23:19] death
[23:20] itself to loose those appointed to death
[23:24] to cancel a people's appointment with
[23:27] the grave right cuz we shall not all
[23:30] sleep but we shall all be
[23:33] changed there will be those who are able
[23:36] to place death under their
[23:40] feet this is the groaning of the
[23:42] prisoner to loose those that are
[23:44] appointed to
[23:46] death you may be deserving of death but
[23:49] you're not appointed to
[23:53] it in Isaiah chapter 61: 1
[23:57] to3 as we're looking at how that the
[23:59] Lord shall arise and have mercy on
[24:03] Zion in Isaiah chapter 61: 1-3 the
[24:06] spirit of the Lord is upon me because
[24:08] the Lord hath appointed me to preach
[24:10] Good Tidings unto the meek Heath sent me
[24:13] to bind up the broken hearted to
[24:14] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[24:17] opening of the prison to them that are
[24:18] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[24:21] the lord we realize that Jesus when he
[24:23] entered into the temple he found where
[24:25] it was written of him in the gospel of
[24:27] Isa the letter the book of of Isaiah and
[24:29] he read to this very portion and he
[24:31] stopped and stopping to read brother bam
[24:34] takes some great uh goes to Great Links
[24:36] to show that this next part did not
[24:39] pertain to this coming that he was in in
[24:41] the Book of Luke so he did not read
[24:44] those things but he said he stopped said
[24:45] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[24:47] it's fulfilled in your ears you're
[24:48] seeing it now before your eyes this day
[24:51] this scripture is fulfilled but the very
[24:54] next part in verse three is to Appo or
[24:56] excuse me the next part after the common
[24:58] not verse three yet but here in verse
[24:59] two to proclaim the accept of the year
[25:01] of the Lord comma think about how many
[25:03] days passed just because of this one
[25:05] comma and the day of Vengeance of our
[25:08] God remember these other scriptures that
[25:10] speak of this day of Vengeance this time
[25:13] of wrath for it is the day of the Lord's
[25:14] Vengeance for the day of vengeance is in
[25:16] my heart but in each time it said in the
[25:18] year of recompense and the year of my
[25:20] redeemed is come so it is a day of
[25:22] Vengeance of our God and this day of
[25:23] Vengeance to comfort all that mourn
[25:27] doesn't seem likely that Vengeance would
[25:29] result in Comfort but rather this is
[25:31] exactly what happens CU God arises for
[25:34] judgment to save the
[25:36] meek there seemed that his wrath was
[25:38] going to be poured out but at that same
[25:40] time God in this time is going to
[25:42] comfort them that mourn in
[25:45] Zion to appoint unto them that mourn in
[25:48] Zion to give unto them so here's the new
[25:52] appointment Beauty for Ashes the oil of
[25:55] joy for mourning the Garment of Praise
[25:57] for the spirit of Heaven is that they
[25:58] might be called Trees of Righteousness
[26:01] the planting of the Lord that he might
[26:03] be glorified this is a new appointment
[26:07] He's going to appoint unto them that
[26:09] mourn in Zion Beauty for Ashes oil of
[26:12] joy for mour a Garment of Praise for the
[26:14] spirit of heaviness Trees of
[26:17] Righteousness this is at the very time
[26:20] that the day of Vengeance of our God is
[26:22] at hand there's something else taking
[26:25] place if you're often looking for
[26:27] Direction what to listen to or what to
[26:29] study uh in the coming year in 2025
[26:33] listen to the series of sermons that
[26:35] brother BR preached in Arizona in
[26:38] January I think it was in Tucson Phoenix
[26:40] and even Flagstaff and in particular to
[26:43] this point in birth pains which he is I
[26:46] think it's January 24th he preaches
[26:47] birth pains and something significant
[26:49] happens at the beginning of that then
[26:51] the next day he preaches this day this
[26:52] scripture is
[26:54] fulfilled and he starts connecting a lot
[26:56] of scriptures and he starts saying
[26:58] saying this day this scripture is
[26:59] fulfilled and he shows the significance
[27:02] of how the scroll was handed to Christ
[27:03] and he read up to this part in the
[27:05] scripture and then stopped and then when
[27:06] he preaches birth pains a priest hands
[27:08] him the Bible and he reads the scripture
[27:10] and brother brandham is bringing us to
[27:12] this place and I'll just have you go
[27:13] listen to where he's stopping and
[27:15] orienting us right here to Isaiah
[27:18] 61 this day of Vengeance of our God but
[27:21] a day of the
[27:22] redeemed a day of comforting so listen
[27:25] to those two if you'd like
[27:29] God arose to judgment but in judging he
[27:32] saved the meek in Psalms 50: 1 to6 the
[27:37] Mighty God even the Lord hath spoken and
[27:39] called the Earth from the rising of the
[27:41] sun un the going down thereof out of
[27:44] Zion think of the Bride in this instance
[27:47] the Perfection of beauty God hath shined
[27:50] her light is going to shine she's going
[27:53] to be in her fullness and full Glory out
[27:55] of the out of Zion the Perfection of
[27:57] beauty God hath shined Our God shall
[28:00] come and shall not keep silence this is
[28:04] the the Lord arising the Lord appearing
[28:06] there's this special
[28:08] dispensation Our God shall come and
[28:10] shall not keep silence a fire shall
[28:13] devour before him and it shall be very
[28:15] tempet tuous round about him it's going
[28:18] to be as a a pillar of fire it's going
[28:20] to be Authority it's going to be
[28:21] manifesting itself as a judge fire going
[28:24] to devour before and very tempet tuous
[28:26] round about him it declar him to be one
[28:28] who's coming to judge in this fierceness
[28:30] of his wrath he shall call to the
[28:32] heavens from above and to the Earth so
[28:35] here he's calling to the heavens above
[28:36] he's on Earth he's judging that he may
[28:39] judge his
[28:42] people now he's going to judge the
[28:45] scripture even says in Psalms among the
[28:47] gods how long will you accept the wicked
[28:50] among the righteous it speaks of now
[28:53] there's a judgment time that he may
[28:55] judge his people now does the bride go
[28:57] through Jud
[28:58] judgement the answer is
[29:01] no she doesn't go to White Throne
[29:03] judgment and you're like yeah you got to
[29:04] be more precise
[29:06] lawyer uh she doesn't go to White Throne
[29:08] judgment she takes her judgment here she
[29:10] judged by the word and she lines up with
[29:13] it she does not have to go through the
[29:15] tribulation to be purged but yet here he
[29:18] stands judging his people so he says
[29:21] gather my Saints together unto me those
[29:24] that have made a covenant with me by
[29:25] sacrifice and the heavens shall declare
[29:28] his righteousness for God is Judge
[29:32] himself God declaring himself as a judge
[29:35] supreme authority the heaven shall
[29:38] declare his righteousness for God is
[29:40] Judge himself say law these are God's
[29:43] characteristics in a time of judgment
[29:45] tempestuous fire devouring before him
[29:47] God is judged a judge and at this time
[29:51] when he is revealed himself as a supreme
[29:53] authority as he's revealed himself as a
[29:56] judge as he's declaring that judgment is
[29:58] at hand he also gathers his
[30:01] people now I'll come to it here in a
[30:06] moment he's Gathering them not to pour
[30:08] out his wrath upon them God's coming
[30:11] gather and because he's coming gather
[30:14] because in this day of Vengeance of our
[30:16] God is a byproduct of the fullness of
[30:18] redemption that when God goes ahead and
[30:20] he's he's finishing up his Redemption
[30:23] process when God is coming to the
[30:24] fullness of redemption then there's a
[30:26] consequence for those who are not a part
[30:28] of it so verse 16 and 17 but unto the
[30:32] wicked God sayith so he's coming as a
[30:34] judge and as he comes as this judge he
[30:37] gathers his
[30:38] people and says but under the wicked God
[30:41] saith so there's a consequence to those
[30:43] who are wicked what hast thou to do to
[30:45] declare my statutes or what or that thou
[30:47] should us take my Covenant in thy
[30:50] mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and
[30:54] castest my words behind thee wow what an
[31:00] indictment to the wicked what do you
[31:03] have to declare my statutes why do you
[31:05] put my words in your mouth why do you
[31:08] take my Covenant with your lips when you
[31:11] hate what my Commandments are and you
[31:13] cast the word behind you you draw nigh
[31:15] unto me with your mouth but your heart
[31:17] is far from my
[31:19] word they've rejected the word the
[31:22] wicked have rejected the word so they're
[31:24] subject to his judgments they're under
[31:27] the threat of of the wrath of this one
[31:29] who is tempet tuous who Goes Forth as a
[31:31] devouring flame they're under the threat
[31:33] of burning and because they're under the
[31:35] threat of judgment they can't be his
[31:38] voice because they have rejected his
[31:40] word you hate my instructions you cast
[31:43] my words behind thee so how can you put
[31:45] my words in your mouth you cannot be my
[31:49] mouthpiece therefore there's nothing
[31:50] left but judgment for those who reject
[31:52] the word as we like to say when we
[31:55] protest no truth no mercy
[32:00] in Malachi 3:
[32:03] 16-18 we're seeing these aspects of
[32:06] Mercy is there in a time of judgment
[32:09] it's connected with Redemption it's
[32:10] connected with the
[32:11] truth Malachi chter 3 verses 161 17 and
[32:15] 18 then they that feared the Lord spake
[32:18] often one to another and the Lord
[32:20] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[32:22] remembrance was written before him for
[32:24] them that fear the lord and that thought
[32:27] upon his name
[32:28] job even saying oh if thou wouldest hide
[32:31] me in secret and then appoint a time
[32:32] that you would remember
[32:34] me as it were even if it was opening up
[32:37] a book and reading the name and saying
[32:40] I've remembered you job because you're
[32:42] in my book of
[32:44] remembrance and it says in verse 17 and
[32:47] they shall be mine sayith the Lord of
[32:49] hosts in that day when I make up my
[32:53] Jewels a woman is a jewel she is a crown
[32:58] this would has a great symbolism of a
[33:00] bride in the day that I make up my
[33:03] Jewels I will spare them as a man
[33:06] spareth his own son that serveth him
[33:10] then shall ye return and discern between
[33:13] the righteous and the wicked between him
[33:16] that serveth God and him that serveth
[33:18] him not I will spare them those that
[33:21] that that I make up that I'm calling my
[33:23] Jewels I will they shall be mine in that
[33:26] day when I make up my Jewels my crowning
[33:30] I will spare them in a day of judgment
[33:32] and a day of Wrath I will have mercy on
[33:34] them I will favor her amen as a father
[33:37] would favor his son that serves him as a
[33:40] father would show mercy and Grace to a
[33:42] son who's obedient to him I will favor
[33:45] her in the same way that the father
[33:47] honored the son and declared himself
[33:50] with him and Jesus said my father has
[33:52] given me power to lay down my life and
[33:54] to take it up again it this was the
[33:57] favor of God to his
[34:02] son and this is the preface to Malachi
[34:04] chapter 4 Malachi chapter 3 I'm not just
[34:07] doing the math but I'm wanting you to
[34:08] recognize Malachi chapter 4 this great
[34:10] and terrible day of the Lord this day
[34:12] when the son of righteousness shall
[34:14] arise with healing in his wings and the
[34:16] bride will go forth as growing up and
[34:19] arise as those that have been fed
[34:20] properly coming to their maturity and
[34:22] their completion this is God's plan for
[34:24] his elect before the great and Dreadful
[34:26] day of the Lord
[34:28] and it's during this
[34:31] time that he's
[34:34] Gathering gather my Saints together unto
[34:38] me in that day that I make up my
[34:41] Jewels it's the time that he gathers
[34:44] Nations and he assembles
[34:50] kingdoms what he's
[34:52] doing is he's separating out the elect
[34:56] for a rapture amen and the rest are
[34:59] subject to tribulation it's a binding
[35:01] for wrath it's a binding for burning and
[35:04] realizing now that I may have removed
[35:05] some scriptures here where brother where
[35:07] the scripture speaks of a gathering
[35:09] together it may be a little bit later
[35:11] but as I was trimming some things I
[35:12] might have left out a couple scriptures
[35:15] but notice this he speaks in the
[35:17] scripture of gathering Nations and
[35:19] kingdoms together in Matthew
[35:23] 13:40 as therefore the tears are
[35:26] gathered and burned in the fire so shall
[35:28] it be in the end of the world and
[35:31] brother brandham said it is binding time
[35:35] now and he says and they are bundling
[35:39] now there's something happened in the
[35:41] spiritual realm I know that we want me
[35:43] me
[35:47] why we may want to look at literal
[35:50] bindings and and see things happening
[35:53] and they're putting all all the
[35:54] Believers on railroad cars to Alaska and
[35:58] and we're being shipped off to one place
[36:00] we're all moving to Jeffersonville and
[36:02] and so we're all we're all being
[36:03] gathered together in some place and then
[36:05] the rest is all collecting together to
[36:07] persecute the bride and we're maybe
[36:09] looking for more literal things but
[36:10] brother BR I'm spiritually identified
[36:13] the foolish virgin he spiritually
[36:15] identified The Binding Together the
[36:17] tears and in the days of his ministry it
[36:19] was binding them it was binding then he
[36:23] says it's binding time now they're
[36:25] bundling now he writes in the church age
[36:27] book the Leo Dean age is the Harvest
[36:29] Time of gathering the tears for binding
[36:32] and burning that's taking place in this
[36:35] time in this age and the Gathering the
[36:38] wheat for the Lord so there's a
[36:40] gathering together of the elect there's
[36:41] a gather my people to me the Lord's
[36:44] going to arise for the purpose of
[36:45] judgment fire is going to be devouring
[36:47] round about him he's going to reveal
[36:49] himself as the supreme authority he's
[36:51] going to declare himself as the wigged
[36:53] one he is going to set one foot on land
[36:55] and one foot on sea and books are going
[36:57] to be open or the book is going to be
[36:59] open God's going to judge but it's not
[37:01] just judgment in the sense of
[37:03] condemnation but it's the fullness of
[37:05] redemption during that
[37:07] time because it's the Gathering of the
[37:09] wheat for the Lord listen to these
[37:11] statements these are just two of many
[37:13] that we could read in the breach between
[37:15] the seven Church ages and the Seven
[37:17] Seals he's talking about John getting
[37:19] all happy and shouting and declaring
[37:21] wonderful things talk about a happy time
[37:23] when the seals broke he asked why why
[37:27] was it at a happy time when the
[37:29] Revelation come that the lamb the
[37:30] Redeemer are Kinsmen so there he is
[37:33] Kinsmen Redeemer this is redemption had
[37:36] come back from the Throne of
[37:39] mediatorial and had walked out there to
[37:41] take his possession now think of some of
[37:45] the elements of the message of the hour
[37:47] that there's a message that goes forth
[37:49] to gather the
[37:50] elect there there there is a a message
[37:53] the living bread of life that brings
[37:55] forth the bride this is redemption
[37:58] claims cuz he says he leaves the Throne
[38:01] of mediation to take his possession in
[38:04] the day when I make up my jewels and the
[38:07] day when I gather my people to myself he
[38:09] says a little bit later in the same
[38:10] sermon the seals were broke why you ask
[38:13] a question again for us this is good the
[38:16] seals are broke in the last Church age
[38:18] to reveal these truths why so the seals
[38:21] are broke why to reveal these
[38:23] truths why were these truths revealed
[38:26] the lamb broke the seals and reveal them
[38:28] to his church in order to collect his
[38:31] subjects for his kingdom his bride he
[38:34] wants to bring his subjects to him now
[38:38] and the language that brother Bam's
[38:39] using in the breach is he's making claim
[38:42] his claim for
[38:44] Redemption these are Redemption claims
[38:47] so at the very time that the lamb in
[38:51] symbolism form is leaving this mercy
[38:53] seat and leaves this place of
[38:55] intercession IM mediation he's coming
[38:58] forward at the time that that happens
[38:59] he's making Redemption claims now this
[39:02] is the fullness of
[39:05] redemption Spirit of the truth the
[39:08] spirit of truth calling the elect to the
[39:10] full word out of traditions for what
[39:14] purpose fullness of redemption not
[39:16] another church age cycle not religion
[39:19] not tradition but for
[39:23] Redemption I believe these things are
[39:25] important for us to ponder amen
[39:29] I think it's important for us to
[39:30] consider these things in light of
[39:31] brother Brandon preaching the Seven
[39:33] Seals Souls that are in prison now
[39:36] Christ is a mystery of God revealed
[39:37] someone pointed out that I had the wrong
[39:38] date on that sermon Christ mystery of
[39:40] God revealed in the slide and it was
[39:41] like hey once it's out there I can't
[39:43] really fix that I guess I could try to
[39:45] go in and edit it the film I need some
[39:47] brothers who are really good at film we
[39:48] can edit the edit the tape online but
[39:51] it's there I made a
[39:53] typo but these things are important for
[39:55] us to consider why brother R used the
[39:57] language that he did why he emphasized
[39:59] the things that he
[40:01] did and I believe that there's an end
[40:05] time well these scriptures that we're
[40:08] using as this Mercy in time of
[40:10] judgment these things we face right
[40:16] now
[40:18] and if we could let's look at the text
[40:20] that we
[40:21] took and again I'm just going to read
[40:23] through these things maybe quickly
[40:27] I hope brother Alfonso's able to catch
[40:30] his breath but in Matthew chapter 9:
[40:33] 11-13 it says and when Pharisees saw it
[40:37] because what is he doing he's eating
[40:38] with these publicans and sinners so look
[40:40] at this guy look at this teacher look at
[40:42] this guy hanging out with the Sinners
[40:43] hanging out with the publicans not
[40:46] Republicans
[40:48] publicans I think it's uh I think the
[40:51] saying is God God is not a Christian is
[40:53] I think what one person sometimes they
[40:55] say well I think there's some logic to
[40:56] that but Jesus is not a republican we
[40:59] could say
[41:00] that but it says that he why does your
[41:03] master eat with publicans and sinners
[41:06] your Rabbi your master your teacher to
[41:08] these disciples these Jews who it would
[41:11] appear that on the face and on the
[41:13] surface they're they're not honoring the
[41:15] the law they're not honoring what God
[41:17] would command of them why does he eat
[41:18] with publicans and Sinners and when
[41:20] Jesus heard that he said unto them they
[41:23] that be whole need not a physician but
[41:25] they that are sick so if someone is
[41:28] completely healthy they don't need a
[41:31] doctor but if you're sick you need a
[41:33] doctor so I think that statement in a
[41:35] lot of ways speaks for itself that he's
[41:38] implying that they are in need of me
[41:41] they are in need of the physician the
[41:43] great
[41:43] physician and then he challenges them
[41:46] with this but you go and learn what this
[41:50] means but go ye and learn what that mean
[41:52] go and learn what this phrase means this
[41:56] scripture I will have mercy and not
[42:00] sacrifice he's asking the Pharisees to
[42:03] consider go back
[42:05] study see if you can figure this out I
[42:08] will have mercy and not
[42:10] sacrifice and he says of himself for I
[42:13] not come to call the righteous but
[42:15] Sinners to
[42:17] repentance the righteous here I know for
[42:20] a long time I viewed it in the sense
[42:21] that there is a day and there's a time
[42:23] when he does call the righteous and
[42:25] maybe just in some type he's going to
[42:27] call the righteous his bride the elect
[42:29] and and not the sinner necessarily but
[42:31] there's this other component to
[42:33] Redemption but here I believe as I've
[42:35] studied this more that there is this
[42:37] component of a rebuke to the Pharisees
[42:40] the righteous the Pharisees the those
[42:42] that are in that traditional system of
[42:44] self-righteousness who made sure
[42:46] everything looked good on the outside
[42:48] and he says well the sick need a
[42:50] physician and you guys think you're fine
[42:52] and and you've whitewashed your tombs
[42:54] and everything looks really really good
[42:55] on the outside but I didn't come for the
[42:57] righteous I came for the Sinners and to
[43:00] call them to
[43:02] repentance so it wasn't that I'm just
[43:04] there to hang out with publicans and
[43:05] sinners because they cook the best and
[43:07] they have the best wine or these are the
[43:09] things this is where the they're they're
[43:10] fun to hang out with and you guys are
[43:12] just sticks in the mud but rather he's
[43:14] saying I'm not just here for the purpose
[43:17] of hanging out and eating with them but
[43:18] I want to call Sinners to
[43:21] repentance and if I could because I feel
[43:23] like this might just be out there uh
[43:26] waiting for
[43:27] more uh uh more emphasis in the word of
[43:32] God but I want us to think about your
[43:34] place today there was this system of
[43:36] self-righteousness there was these
[43:38] collection of Pharisees and Sadducees
[43:40] and these scribes and this tradition
[43:42] that they had built around the law of
[43:44] God and around a true God and true
[43:45] religion and they had this form of
[43:47] worship that God had accepted but there
[43:49] they were so caught up in their
[43:51] Traditions it was blinding them to God
[43:53] fulfilling his promised word right
[43:55] before them and he said the Kingdom of
[43:57] Heaven is at hand and he called men to
[44:00] repent and there is this great
[44:02] transition or this Exodus in this second
[44:04] Exodus he's there speaking to them and
[44:06] he's condemning the system because he
[44:08] knows that there's going to be judgment
[44:10] on that system and they've got to come
[44:11] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[44:13] he's saying I've got to call them to
[44:16] repentance and I'd like for us to
[44:18] consider where we sit today and what our
[44:20] part is today our place
[44:23] today as he said I will have mercy and
[44:25] not sacrifice sacrifice was the main
[44:28] part of their ceremonial law you do away
[44:31] the sacrifices and offerings you're not
[44:32] left with
[44:34] much and he says this sacrifice and how
[44:38] substantial it would be to them I will
[44:41] have mercy and not sacrifice in other
[44:42] words I love Mercy more than
[44:47] sacrifice the law could keep be kept
[44:50] ceremonially
[44:51] surfly it could be kept externally as a
[44:54] tradition and in doing so Jesus Calls
[44:56] the phes Hypocrites CU he says that they
[44:59] are able to give pretense outwardly but
[45:01] still inwardly be Wicked so their
[45:04] religion was a
[45:05] covering it was man-made they had made
[45:08] the word of God of no effect through
[45:09] tradition they weren't catching the
[45:11] heart of what the law was pointing to
[45:14] Paul goes to Great Lengths in Romans and
[45:15] Hebrews to point out that these things
[45:17] were all pointing to Christ these things
[45:20] were foreshadowing it wasn't the better
[45:22] Covenant they spoke of a more perfect
[45:24] Covenant we spent a lot of time in this
[45:27] series on the house of the Lord dealing
[45:28] with the Pharisees and their hypocrisy
[45:30] and their pretense Matthew 23:23 woe
[45:33] unto you scribes and Pharisees
[45:35] Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and
[45:38] Anis and cumin and have omitted the
[45:39] weightier matters of the
[45:41] law they were very precise and detailed
[45:44] in these surface things and these things
[45:46] that could be measured out precisely
[45:48] well how long is this and and how is
[45:50] this working but then he said there's
[45:51] the weigher matters of the law which is
[45:54] Judgment mercy and faith
[45:57] and here again it's connected together
[45:58] judgment mercy and truth faith Fidelity
[46:01] these are the weigher matters of the law
[46:03] and lest you misunderstand what Christ
[46:04] is saying he says these ought ye to have
[46:07] done you ought to do judgment mercy and
[46:10] Faith but not leave the other
[46:13] undone so do the tithe of men nanis and
[46:15] cumin but don't omit judgment mercy and
[46:19] Faith so when he ask go learn what was
[46:22] meant I will have mercy and not
[46:24] sacrifice he's wanting them in in their
[46:27] religious system in their order of
[46:28] worship and their Viewpoint of the law
[46:30] to think about what was at the heart of
[46:33] it what's that my heart what is it
[46:35] you're supposed to get out of out of the
[46:38] law that I'm just this ruthless
[46:40] Taskmaster who's ordered all these
[46:42] things for you to obey and that if you
[46:44] obey them perfectly then I will just
[46:45] look past your
[46:48] sin it means
[46:51] something I was going to save this for
[46:54] uh next Sunday but I'll just read the
[46:56] whole portion I just going to read verse
[46:57] 6 but I want to read the whole portion
[46:59] and I want to say this as we read this
[47:01] this day this scripture is being
[47:03] fulfilled Come and Let Us return unto
[47:06] the Lord and Malachi says then shall ye
[47:09] return and discern between the righteous
[47:10] and the wicked Malachi chapter four
[47:13] speaks of Elijah coming in the end time
[47:15] to turn us back to the Lord come let us
[47:18] return unto the Lord for Heth torn and
[47:20] he will heal us Heath smitten and he
[47:23] will bind us up some great truths
[47:26] contained in that after two days he will
[47:28] revive us in the third day he will raise
[47:32] us up and we shall live in his sight or
[47:35] in his presence going to be a raising up
[47:38] of the Bride in the third day listen
[47:40] there's no stumbling that were there in
[47:42] the year 2000s right there's no no
[47:44] stumbling that we've entered into this
[47:46] third day because we are it is in this
[47:48] time that the bride is going to come to
[47:50] a completion to the fullness of
[47:51] redemption after two days he will revive
[47:54] us he will life will be coming into into
[47:56] the body he will raise us up and we're
[47:58] going to live in his
[48:00] presence speaking of this great hour
[48:02] when we return to the Lord then shall we
[48:05] know when that which is perfect is come
[48:08] then shall we know if we follow on to
[48:10] know the
[48:12] Lord his going forth is prepared as the
[48:16] morning it is the rising of the Sun and
[48:19] he shall come unto us as the rain as a
[48:22] latter and former rain unto the Earth
[48:25] teaching and harvest Reign together he
[48:28] says oh Ephraim what shall I do unto
[48:30] thee Oh Judah what shall I do unto thee
[48:33] for your goodness your mercy is the word
[48:36] there you it's translated to
[48:38] merciful this is of Ephraim and Judah is
[48:41] as a morning cloud and as the early do
[48:43] it goeth
[48:45] away it it it's not remaining what am I
[48:47] going to do with
[48:49] you therefore I've hewed them by the
[48:52] prophets I've slain them by the words of
[48:55] my mouth and thy judgments are as the
[48:58] light that goeth
[48:59] forth for I desired
[49:02] mercy your Mercy's run out you don't
[49:04] even you're not showing
[49:06] Mercy you may keep sacrifices you you
[49:09] you may do all these external things but
[49:12] I'm going to judge I've slain my
[49:14] judgments go forth for I have I desired
[49:17] mercy and not sacrifice and the
[49:20] knowledge of God more than burnt
[49:24] offerings notice this together com Let
[49:26] Us return to the Lord that we may know
[49:30] him and that when we know him when we
[49:33] follow on to know the Lord this Lord
[49:35] who's going forth is prepared as the
[49:37] morning who's going to come to us as the
[49:38] former and latter rign upon the Earth in
[49:41] that day he will heal us he will revive
[49:43] us he will restore to us he will build
[49:45] us up for he desired mercy and the
[49:49] knowledge of God more than sacrifice and
[49:51] burnt offerings but they like men have
[49:54] transgressed the Covenant
[49:57] there have they dealt treacherously
[49:59] against
[50:04] me come let us return unto the
[50:08] Lord your mercy Runs Out Ephraim and
[50:11] Judah therefore I've cut them by the
[50:15] prophets I've slain them by my words of
[50:17] my mouth my judgments go forth as the
[50:18] light that goes forth and he says I
[50:21] desired Mercy in the knowledge of me I
[50:23] didn't want just sacrifice and burnt
[50:25] offerings to obey is better than
[50:28] sacrifice the knowledge of the Lord that
[50:31] is right that's what you should be
[50:32] Desiring
[50:34] amen so he's declaring
[50:37] come come let us
[50:42] return though I've smitten you though
[50:45] I've torn you I want to heal you I want
[50:48] to bind you up so the son of
[50:51] righteousness arises with healing in his
[50:53] wings God arises to judge his people he
[50:56] comes comes to save the meek he comes to
[50:58] comfort those that mourn it's a time of
[51:00] appointment it's in that time that God
[51:02] is saying now you must know me for who I
[51:05] am and all that I am and this is what I
[51:08] want I don't want sacrifice I don't want
[51:10] just offerings I want mercy and I want
[51:13] the knowledge of me I want you to know
[51:15] me at my core who I am in my heart I
[51:17] want the full word to be made known to
[51:19] you I want you to understand my plan in
[51:21] my heart I want you to know the secret
[51:23] in the back part of my
[51:25] mind amen
[51:27] in Acts chap
[51:29] 17:30 Paul speaking to them there in
[51:33] Athens who Mars Hill who were worshiping
[51:36] the unknown
[51:39] God and he says and at and the times of
[51:42] this ignorance God winked at when you
[51:44] were ignorantly worshiping he has sent
[51:47] forth Jesus Christ this repuation his
[51:49] son into the world who's died and rose
[51:52] again and he speaks of the Resurrection
[51:53] he says there was a time when you were
[51:54] ignorant of this true God there there
[51:56] was a time when you didn't even know he
[51:57] sent his son there was a time when you
[51:58] didn't know there was a more excellent
[52:00] way there was a time when you did not
[52:01] know these things and at the time of
[52:03] your ignorance God winked at what does
[52:05] that mean God looked past it God was
[52:07] longsuffering he was
[52:09] forbearing if anything it was for it was
[52:12] the god's forbearance in Christ even
[52:15] that atonement that sacrifice God was
[52:17] longsuffering for all those who believed
[52:19] not but now that he's come He commands
[52:22] men everywhere to repent but now
[52:26] commandeth all men everywhere to repent
[52:30] Christ came to call Sinners to
[52:35] repentance and there's an application of
[52:37] this scripture at the time that we're
[52:38] living in
[52:41] now where the church ages God and
[52:44] brother bam is is plain about this
[52:47] God through the work of intercession
[52:50] through Christ the mediator the
[52:54] atonement he winked at ignorance
[52:57] brother writes this in the church age
[52:59] book chapter 10 and that very same
[53:01] spirit and Doctrine is Right amongst all
[53:03] Protestants and it is called
[53:05] denomination nanism is organization
[53:08] humanizing the leadership of the church
[53:10] and thereby deposing the spirit bism is
[53:13] denominationalism which takes the church
[53:15] manual instead of the
[53:17] Bible and right to this hour many of
[53:19] God's people are caught in the snare of
[53:23] denominationalism catch this many of
[53:26] God's people people are caught God's
[53:27] people I'm going to gather my people
[53:29] going to make up my
[53:31] Jewels I I I I I I'll come in this time
[53:34] when I want to I'm going to come to take
[53:36] my people but they're caught up in the
[53:38] snare of denominationalism and God is
[53:40] crying to them come out of her my people
[53:43] lest you be partakers of her sins that
[53:46] you receive not of her
[53:47] plagues they're in the denominations
[53:49] they're in the systems they're in bism
[53:51] they're nanism they're in these isms you
[53:54] see they are
[53:57] ignorant and he says but if the Rapture
[54:00] should take place at this moment
[54:02] ignorance would be no court of appeal
[54:04] from the Judgment of God for being in
[54:07] the wrong
[54:09] ranks God's people at one
[54:12] time they they occupied well maybe I'm
[54:15] maybe I'm making a statement that I hope
[54:17] speaking to mature message Believers and
[54:19] you all are taught well this isn't just
[54:21] I know I'm not just scattering this out
[54:22] to people who've never uh seen these
[54:24] things for themselves in the scripture
[54:26] but there's godly people in all
[54:28] organizations and denominations that God
[54:30] was people were receiving births and
[54:32] coming through these systems we even
[54:33] recognize that God was using Church age
[54:36] Messengers who didn't have a full
[54:38] understanding of the godhead others that
[54:40] didn't fully understand this what was
[54:42] that God's mercy that there was this
[54:45] perpetuation there was this testimony
[54:46] that met the mark that stood there
[54:48] covering and God would have people in
[54:51] these organizations but there comes a
[54:52] time when God finally says he sends a
[54:55] voice and come out of her my people and
[54:58] he gathers them because God is wanting
[55:00] to finish up Redemption and you can't
[55:02] stay there anymore you've got to come
[55:04] out in order to go and if you remain
[55:06] you're going to be subject to
[55:08] judgment he says the Rapture could take
[55:11] place and you couldn't say well I didn't
[55:13] know because he says now ignorance is no
[55:15] longer an
[55:17] excuse when he's preaching Revelation 4
[55:20] part 3 in 1961 in the revelation of
[55:22] Jesus Christ series as far as three Gods
[55:24] that's from hell there's one God that's
[55:27] exactly right now do you say then do you
[55:30] believe that all these people that are
[55:31] trinitarians are of hell no sir I
[55:34] believe they are
[55:36] Christians but the hour is approaching
[55:39] brother where they are sincerely
[55:43] wrong what hour was
[55:45] approaching what could it be that would
[55:48] come after
[55:50] 1961 that would actually be a time when
[55:52] God would say enough's
[55:54] enough there's no more
[55:57] excuse the hour is approaching brother
[56:00] where they are sincerely
[56:02] wrong they're
[56:05] ignorant but there's a time of
[56:08] ignorance where God will no longer wink
[56:10] but command to
[56:13] repent now we might like to think well
[56:15] Mercy Mercy's not over I could keep
[56:17] doing wrong and there's still
[56:20] Mercy but the dispensation that's over
[56:22] is that you can't claim ignorance
[56:24] anymore
[56:26] you've got to line up with the word of
[56:28] God Revelations 3:14 to20 and under the
[56:31] angel of the Church of Le Deans WR these
[56:33] things sayth the amen the faithful and
[56:35] true witness the beginning of the
[56:36] creation of God do you realize the
[56:39] ministry of brother bradam fulfilled so
[56:41] many different scriptures the seventh
[56:42] angel of Revelations
[56:43] 10:7 the seventh angel to the Church of
[56:46] leod Deans a son of man revealing these
[56:48] son of man the Elijah of Malachi
[56:53] 45 and brother brandham even says in
[56:56] about about Revelations
[56:58] 55 that that lamb who took the book
[57:00] immediately comes to Revelations
[57:02] [Music]
[57:04] 10:7 think of these
[57:06] things write these things sayith amen
[57:08] the faithful and true witness the
[57:09] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[57:11] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[57:13] hot I would thou W cold or hot so then
[57:16] because Thou Art lukewarm and neither
[57:18] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[57:20] mouth judgment separation because thou
[57:24] sayest I am rich and increased with
[57:26] goods and have need of nothing and
[57:28] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[57:30] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[57:32] now notice this because you're
[57:36] ignorant I counsel
[57:38] thee God at one time looked past this
[57:43] ignorance God at one time knew that they
[57:46] were wretched and Afflicted and
[57:48] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[57:50] yet thought differently about themselves
[57:52] but he says because you're ignorant I
[57:54] will counsel thee and with this counsel
[57:57] you're going to be accountable you can
[57:59] no longer claim ignorance ignorance will
[58:01] not be in the court of appeal from this
[58:05] judgment I counsel thee to buy of me

[58:09] be rich and white rment that thou mayest

[58:17] thou mayest
[58:19] see as many as I love I rebuke and
[58:22] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[58:28] repent these are the words to leod
[58:31] deia this age of the Harvest
[58:35] Time of gathering tears for binding and
[58:37] burning and the Gathering in the wheat
[58:39] for the
[58:40] Lord so wherein do we find the
[58:43] transition of those who remained blind
[58:45] and miserable and those that are going
[58:48] to take his counsel behold I stand at
[58:51] the door and knock If any man hear my
[58:53] voice and open the door I will come into
[58:55] him and will Su with him and he with
[58:58] me learn the saying what does it mean I
[59:01] will have mercy and not
[59:04] sacrifice for I love Mercy more than
[59:07] sacrifice I desired Mercy not sacrifice
[59:10] I desired the knowledge of God greater
[59:12] than burnt
[59:14] offerings it's the question that he
[59:16] asked when he's being chastised for who
[59:18] he is sitting down with and
[59:22] eating I counsel thee to buy of me I
[59:26] counsel thee to take of
[59:28] me behold I stand at the door and knock

[59:35] will repent I will come into him and
[59:37] will s with him and he with
[59:41] me brother bam uses this language in the
[59:44] places he preaches the power to
[59:46] transform and God's power of
[59:47] transformation or the power of
[59:48] transformation and God's power to
[59:51] transform in this deformity chaos that
[59:53] we're in God has sent his transforming
[59:57] power his word Vindicated proven to
[1:00:02] bring you out of this religious
[1:00:04] deformity of ignorance that you're
[1:00:06] walking in naked blind miserable and
[1:00:10] don't know
[1:00:12] it this is the time that we're living
[1:00:15] in I would I would say especially as my
[1:00:18] heart's overwhelmed with the thought of
[1:00:19] the voice of Mercy this is why we really
[1:00:21] need to be accurate reflections of the
[1:00:23] message of the hour otherwise we're no
[1:00:26] different than the Pharisees who looked
[1:00:29] at Jesus Christ sitting down with the
[1:00:31] publicans and Sinners and
[1:00:33] judging well light can't have fellowship
[1:00:35] with darkness and far be it for me to do
[1:00:37] this and do that and we completely
[1:00:39] missed that Christ was there as an act
[1:00:41] of Mercy not as an act of compromise not
[1:00:45] an act of plating and watering down but
[1:00:48] it was an act of Mercy they are sick
[1:00:51] they need
[1:00:52] mercy and there's so many that sit back
[1:00:54] in this end time with their folded
[1:00:56] Revelations 3:17 Revelations 3:17 and
[1:00:59] they're calling for God's Wrath and
[1:01:01] God's judgment but who are those that
[1:01:03] are on Earth at this time who are
[1:01:06] recognizing that judgment is going to
[1:01:08] strike and we don't want people to be
[1:01:13] lost and that we were ignorant ourselves
[1:01:16] at one time but God sent his
[1:01:18] transforming power Revelations 18:4 the
[1:01:21] Elijah turning our hearts to what take
[1:01:23] us out of the deformity of ignorance am
[1:01:26] we had to come out of ignorance why
[1:01:28] because ignorance is no longer being
[1:01:31] weaked
[1:01:33] at brother Brandon brings this deformity
[1:01:35] of ignorance right down to Revelations 3
[1:01:37] naked blind miserable and don't know
[1:01:41] it in the sermon the breach between the
[1:01:43] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals
[1:01:45] brother Brown speaking of the Lamb he
[1:01:47] says where did it come from it come from
[1:01:50] the father's Throne where he was seated
[1:01:53] since he had been slain and raised again
[1:01:56] now in this image and this visual as
[1:01:58] brother bram's dramatizing it and taking
[1:02:01] these this happening this scriptural
[1:02:04] happening he's looking at in these terms
[1:02:05] of behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:02:07] hath prevailed to take the book and
[1:02:08] loose the seals thereof and John turns
[1:02:11] and looks and he sees a lamb as it had
[1:02:13] been slain and the lamb which had been
[1:02:16] slain went to the father and took the
[1:02:17] book it's this it paints this picture
[1:02:21] that Christ who had been raised up
[1:02:22] seated at the right hand of the father
[1:02:25] as an interceder there's only one uh
[1:02:27] intercessor between God and man the man
[1:02:29] Christ Jesus whoever liveth to make
[1:02:31] mediation to intercede so he's in this
[1:02:33] office he's in this place but now he's
[1:02:36] moving something's transpiring and he
[1:02:38] comes to take the book brother man says
[1:02:39] where did he come from it's the lamb who
[1:02:41] come from the father's Throne where he'd
[1:02:42] been seated and raised up and sat on the
[1:02:44] right hand of God brother bam says ever
[1:02:47] living to make intercessions
[1:02:50] amen raised there today as an
[1:02:52] intercessor with his own blood to make
[1:02:54] intercession notice how he describes it
[1:02:56] upon the ignorance of the
[1:03:02] people now I know that it's it's 11:33
[1:03:05] on my
[1:03:07] watch
[1:03:09] and this is a lot to think
[1:03:11] about this is the language that brother
[1:03:13] bradam uses he describes this place of
[1:03:15] intercession this place of mediation
[1:03:17] that he's there making intercession upon
[1:03:19] the ignorance of the
[1:03:22] people so it's a parallel of the same
[1:03:24] gospel that Paul preached at the times
[1:03:25] of this ignorance God winked at but now
[1:03:27] commandeth all men everywhere to repent
[1:03:30] as Paul even said they without us could
[1:03:31] not be made perfect we realize too
[1:03:33] through the church ages God's
[1:03:34] foreshadowing this coming of a Perfect
[1:03:36] Bride the bride being the Capstone they
[1:03:38] without us could not be made perfect and
[1:03:40] here we see a similar declaration that
[1:03:42] the lamb is there interceding he is a
[1:03:45] mediator his mediatorial work is making
[1:03:47] intercession upon the ignorance of the
[1:03:49] people now catch this this is very this
[1:03:52] is uh I I I I want to say it with some
[1:03:55] Authority and and and be very definitive
[1:03:58] but I I'll say it for you to think
[1:04:00] about that when Christ was slain our
[1:04:03] faith in that sacrifice is a finished
[1:04:06] work it's the atonement so Christ isn't
[1:04:09] out there in heaven dying continually
[1:04:12] before the father for our sins and he's
[1:04:15] not necessarily reminding the father
[1:04:17] that we accepted the sacrifice but he
[1:04:20] stands there throughout these seven
[1:04:22] Church ages as the mark the perfect one
[1:04:26] the one that's meeting that the bleeding
[1:04:28] bloody sacrifice the perfect one this
[1:04:31] perfect word through the church ages
[1:04:33] there as a buffer interceding over
[1:04:37] ignorance but now we have a voice saying
[1:04:41] repent
[1:04:44] amen why the Final Phase of redemption
[1:04:47] is
[1:04:48] underway it's the entire word that comes
[1:04:52] forth yesen therefore there's a message
[1:04:54] of Mercy
[1:04:58] brother BR I think he said it when we
[1:04:59] read the other day the Cry of Mercy
[1:05:01] before
[1:05:02] judgment a
[1:05:04] warning and what's the
[1:05:07] warning the warning is if you stay where
[1:05:11] you
[1:05:12] are you can't make
[1:05:15] it if you hold to your Creeds you hold
[1:05:18] to your Traditions you hold to the lies
[1:05:20] you hold to the partial truth if you
[1:05:22] don't come to Christ if you don't
[1:05:23] forsake tradition I theology I idolatry
[1:05:27] all those things if you don't forsake it
[1:05:29] if you don't come out of her out of
[1:05:31] organization out of nanism out of out of
[1:05:34] all these things and you don't come to
[1:05:36] Christ as individuals amen I mean too
[1:05:39] bad we couldn't just start a church and
[1:05:42] say whoever goes here is
[1:05:44] safe you've got to do this as an
[1:05:47] individual if you don't come out of her
[1:05:50] and come to
[1:05:51] Christ tribulation is what's left you
[1:05:55] won't be G gathered with the wheat into
[1:05:56] the Garner at the time of the change in
[1:05:58] the meeting in the air when this Rapture
[1:06:01] goes you won't be a part of
[1:06:04] it and when you look out on the systems
[1:06:06] and the organizations and the splitting
[1:06:09] and all the different definitions of
[1:06:11] Jesus the thousands of different
[1:06:12] denominations all preaching to you a
[1:06:14] different Christ brother brandom in the
[1:06:16] sermon The God Who is rich in Mercy
[1:06:18] Brothers if you could come to your
[1:06:20] instruments he says the God who is rich
[1:06:22] in Mercy what we need on the scene today
[1:06:24] is a prophet
[1:06:26] that will destroy the idol of
[1:06:28] denominations that thinks they're going
[1:06:30] into heaven upon the belonging upon
[1:06:32] belonging to some Creed or
[1:06:34] denomination needs to be destroyed and
[1:06:37] burnt up and thrown
[1:06:40] away he's pronouncing judgment on these
[1:06:43] organizations he says what we need is a
[1:06:45] prophet to
[1:06:47] come a prophet that'll destroy the idol
[1:06:49] of denominations but not to judge
[1:06:51] everyone therein right this is me
[1:06:53] amplifying this is me looking at the
[1:06:54] totality of God who is rich in Mercy
[1:06:56] it's not a prophet to come on the scene
[1:06:58] and just burn the whole thing up but to
[1:06:59] get the wheat out
[1:07:02] first God is full of Mercy he's rich in
[1:07:06] Mercy in the day that when we could have
[1:07:09] all been in that chaos of Darkness out
[1:07:11] there but God rich in Mercy has sent us
[1:07:14] the real genuine Holy Ghost with his own
[1:07:17] interpretation to it right here in the
[1:07:19] building every night God rich in Mercy
[1:07:21] how wonderful we find him to be this is
[1:07:25] the Cry of of Mercy this is the
[1:07:26] pronouncement of judgment it is the day
[1:07:28] of Vengeance of our God it is the day of
[1:07:32] the
[1:07:33] Lord please don't attach any traditional
[1:07:37] understanding to these things and don't
[1:07:38] run it through a denominational filter
[1:07:40] you bring it before the Lord ask God
[1:07:42] give you the the perfect clarity of
[1:07:43] these things things that are transpiring
[1:07:45] spiritually or things that are in type
[1:07:47] or foreshadowing just be sure you stay
[1:07:49] true to how God is going to reveal this
[1:07:51] to you but I'm wanting you to see these
[1:07:53] things in the scripture that we're
[1:07:54] living in a time where the Prophet is
[1:07:56] saying judgment is striking judgment is
[1:07:59] hand who is that Lord up there who is it
[1:08:02] that's our Lord what is it revealed
[1:08:03] himself as the supreme authority the
[1:08:06] Supreme judge of Heaven and
[1:08:08] Earth and what does he come he's come
[1:08:10] declaring his
[1:08:12] word for all seven seals are open to
[1:08:15] those who can receive
[1:08:16] it everything is
[1:08:20] ready it's a message of
[1:08:24] Mercy now this message has been run
[1:08:27] through filters and hasn't always been
[1:08:30] accurately
[1:08:32] expressed but my prayer is that God who
[1:08:34] is rich in Mercy would reveal himself to
[1:08:36] you that you could be a vessel of Mercy
[1:08:39] not only one who's obtained
[1:08:41] it and one who has been filled with
[1:08:44] Mercy but one who has Mercy that's
[1:08:47] renewed every
[1:08:49] morning ones who can be merciful amen
[1:08:53] and can show Mercy
[1:08:56] because the day of vengeance is in God's
[1:08:58] heart but the year of the redeemed is
[1:09:03] come this is why even Scholars and uh
[1:09:06] commentators and those throughout
[1:09:08] history when they looked at the events
[1:09:09] of Revelations 5 they saw it as a change
[1:09:12] from intercession to
[1:09:15] Redemption they could see this
[1:09:17] transition of this time when the lamb
[1:09:19] was doing something very specific but
[1:09:21] now it's time for fullness of
[1:09:23] redemption that's the time that we're
[1:09:25] living in now I
[1:09:27] believe and in this hour and in this
[1:09:29] time God has sent to us a real genuine
[1:09:33] word to call us out of the chaos of
[1:09:36] Darkness out of the deformity of
[1:09:40] ignorance why did he have to do it
[1:09:42] because ignorance is no longer a court
[1:09:45] of appeal for God's
[1:09:48] judgment if you couldn't take it for
[1:09:50] absolute fulfillment in type God for
[1:09:55] years brother Bram said through the
[1:09:56] church ages he was an intercessor to
[1:09:59] make intercession upon the ignorance of
[1:10:01] the people but now but now these are my
[1:10:04] words but now he commands everywhere to
[1:10:06] come unto
[1:10:07] him come to me come out of her my people
[1:10:11] come to the word come back to the Faith
[1:10:14] of Our Apostolic
[1:10:16] fathers come back to the
[1:10:20] word and in that word there's the
[1:10:23] salvation for the meek
[1:10:25] there's the Comfort to all that mourn
[1:10:28] there's the appointment to quickening
[1:10:31] power to snatch us from death into life
[1:10:35] there in there is where there's power to
[1:10:39] rise above and to be changed in a moment
[1:10:42] and a twinkling of an eye if we could
[1:10:44] stand together and pray
