TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we're talking about the house of the Lord maybe the emphasis has been uh making our houses homes even in the last service is kind of what we were touching on is we can have different houses but they there's more to a house there's something about a house that makes it a home and just having an edifice or a bed or a place that you store your goods doesn't make a dwell in a home but brother bam talks about the order and the character is what makes a house a home and we drew a lot from Mark 3:25 which says and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand and so we I think the title we were using A House Divided is no home so if there's any kind of division or disorder or chaos that's not the feelings you have of home and I know we could kind of make the argument that some of us have experienced things in life where we have a c particular definition of what family is or maybe chaos um maybe dysfunction is what describes your family or chaos describes your home and unless there's chaos that's not not home or unless there's not dysfunction that's not family that's not really what we're identifying we're identifying what home really should be and the order and the character uh that there ought to be and as we were looking at a house divided as no home we ended on the thought that we as men are called to be home builders ladies are called to be Homemakers and we each have a role in uh in making our hearts homes but we've been looking at the making our house where we dwell where we live where we bite our time turning it in uh to a place that also honors the Lord where the Lord is welcome brother BR makes that statement the Revival doesn't come by the preacher Revival didn't come because brother Jason was here Revival didn't come because of brother Andre or or brother Tim DOD Revival's not coming when brother Ed makes it but Revival comes by the people in their home life uh and so we have the power of Revival in the way that we keep our homes and the way that we live our daily lives and so tonight my title is as for me and my home and I think I might have actually truncated a little bit on the slide there and when I uh did the online but it's as for me and my home and I want to emphasize this our Christian Duty begins first at home uh we identify Christianity with church and there's a lot of things we identify the message with Ministry and preaching and a lot of things that relate to church service but I want us to recognize that our duty begins first at home and that's where we really want to focus our efforts in growing as a Christian is not so much in how we worship here but how we worship God outside now if you could look at mark 3: 27 this is where I want to start tonight and just appreciate your attentiveness and you're pulling on the word already but it says in verse 27 this is we're looking at a house divided cannot stand but it says no man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house this is Jesus teaching them that I am not part of Satan's house I'm not be elub because I'm not casting out demons um as the head of the house against myself but rather I've entered into Satan's kingdom and I have bound his power therefore I'm able to spoil his house and spoil his power over these humans to cast out these demons and so we could kind of back up and identify that if you can bind what gives power to the house bind the one that watches out over the house bind the one that sets the order bind the one who's the strongest in the house Jesus is saying then you can divide it uh the house wasn't divided against itself on its own rather but Christ had stepped into it caused the division and therefore he could cast these demons out so we could take away from that that if you can bind the strong man of the house you can ruin the house in that phrase bind the strong man I just want to point to this very quickly uh that that man of strength in any house ought to be the husband we know there may be some situations where there is no husband uh perhaps even if you're living on your own you wouldn't necessarily have that marital relationship to identify this and so maybe we'll bring more into this later but if you were to look at that to bind the strong man in a dwelling in a household the husband the father would be that strong man and so it would to bind the strong would to be bind the husband bind the master or the head of the house and that's what that hus would be and husband so you you you bind the the the strong man I'm thinking about this idea of binding that man the man of the house if you can get him to compromise if you could break fatherhood if you could break motherhood if you could break that backbone of the family then the Nations broke is what brother bam taught us and even in that word husband there's a lot of a lot of ways that we could look at this but that husband was one who was the head of that dwelling the head of a house but the the band in that comes from the word bond meaning to to become or to grow and even the term is it would be used in the Old English it would speak of one who is Bond even the scripture speaks of bond or free that Bond would be one who is under a Lord to give service to that Lord so the husband in a house would be the one who's the head of that dwelling and maybe he's bond to someone greater than him but that's his household he's the husband of that home but he has one greater he's bound to service or has a loyalty uh above himself and I think it's really good to think of ourselves that way that while we uh may have things that we own and things we possess we owe a greater loyalty to the Lord that the head of man is Christ and that he is we're bound to him and we serve him so a husband ought to have loyalty to Christ loyalty to the word and then to bind the strong man even in the language it was just really striking me more and more that the husband is bound to Christ we ought to be bound the strong man of the house is bound to a greater power in the right order but to bind the strong man is to bring him under another spirit and another Power a power of another so he's bound to Christ but but when you break that b uh binding you break that tie and bind them to something else you rebind man of the house to something else is that making sense to you and and the the word picture that maybe we could draw there now just to help you with that in Mark chapter 3 where he's saying uh the to bind the strong men that word he's using to bind the strong man the same word is used in Luke chap 13 and just look at verse 11 it says behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity many 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself so the the way that this she's being described is she was kind of drawn together she was bowed up together and could in no wise lift up herself so she bent forward and she's bowing and if we can look at it this way she's bowing to that infirmity uh she should be upright her shoulders should be back her backbone should be straight but she's bent forward as if to Bow under the weight and the birth burden of the sickness so in verse 16 Jesus says ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath bound low these 18 years be loosed from this Bond on the Sabbath day they were taking issue with the fact that he was doing on the Sabbath day and Jesus saying well isn't it right isn't it proper that this daughter of Abraham who's been bound by Satan there's that word bind the strong man she has been bound by Satan Satan had put a bind on her and in binding her physically she's bowing to that sickness she's under the power of that sickness she she can't stand up she can't stand for herself and Jesus says isn't it right that this one who's been bowed and is bowing down to Satan be loosed from this bond this is to be loosed from that binding except you first bind the strong man and what has happened if you would look at this Christ was going to lose her from that Christ was going to lose her from that time and in Mark chapter 3 Christ bound the one who is uh who is in control under his own authority in order to cast out demons so I know we're kind of maybe taking the inverse of that before Satan can do anything in your lives you have to first be loosed from the preeminence of Christ and there has to be a rebinding you have to retie yourself to something else so Christ came in he bound Satan and binding Satan he could cast out his devils and therefore our house is spoiled when we are bound by or bow to another power as Christians we we ought to be bound to Christ we want him to have preeminence in our lives and the only way Satan can have access to us is really if we allow it really if in our own power we bow to him now and this brings us to the language of Joshua chapter 24 and and if this seems like a little bit of a stretch maybe just exercise some of your your spiritual uh wisdom to see how this ties together so well but now as it goes forth in verse 14 he says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth now that's a that's a great commandment to us serve him fear the Lord give him reverence obey him serve him in sincerity and in truth and we must we must do that and in order to do that says and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and serve ye the Lord so this is give reverence and service to God and God alone and put away the service you did to other gods so there was a bowing down to false gods and now he's saying be bound to to God himself and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve now they G given a choice whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell there they could have gone back to some some tradition they could have been Bound by something in their modern times there but he says but as for me in my house and that's where I get my phrasing tonight as for me in my home Joshua speaking says but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord we won't bow down to traditions we won't bow down to formal Idols we won't bow down to the things that we served before but we will serve I will serve we will bow down to the one true God we will be bound to him we will fear the fear the lord serve him in sincerity and in truth and the people answered it's as if it really did resonate with them and the people answered said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve or to bow down uh to give service to and be subject to other gods for the Lord Is Our God he is that brought us out brought us up in our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed shows us that the service to other gods It's Not Just an Illusion to to slavery but it's illusion to the spiritual bondage he said we we served other gods but he's brought us out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage we were in that place where we were bound to a strong man we were we were not the masters of our own house we were in a house that was in bondage and service to other gods is bondage to another Power besides God and they said we have been loosed so choose you this day whom you will serve whom you will labor under whom you will be subject to now this is relevant we could bring in a lot of different scriptures I know I've used it quite a bit I might even have a little bit of a complex in referring to it but Paul taught all things were lawful but I will not be brought under the power of any there's a lot of lawful things unlawfully used that become a bondage to us people can be in bondage to things that we could argue or innocent well what's wrong with that and what's wrong with that and we could say well on the face of it really nothing's wrong with it and maybe as you dig into it nothing's wrong with it but the power that it has over you is the evidence that there's some leaven in there there's something wrong there you're forfeiting your Liberty as a Christian to something that you ought to be free from and it's amazing the language that people use about their their lack of obedience to the word of God or even their worldliness and they say they're free they're free I'm free I don't have to do this anymore I'm free I don't have to do that and maybe they're speaking of a time when they were under legalism or they were doing things out of tradition and they weren't doing things with the free heart in the Lord but now they're using that verbiage to say they're free because now exercising themselves in in fleshly things they're not being obedient to the word and they don't realize that they're forfeiting their Liberty in Christ to something else and it's a worse bondage than the one they were under before amen so to choose whom you will serve is to choose who you will bow to choose who you'll be subject to and the only way that our our the way that our houses are unable to become homes is when we allow ourselves to bow to something other than the Lord so I won't let the strong man I won't let myself be bound to an idol to weaken my home I with Joshua is saying choose you this day whom you'll bow to will you bow to the world will you bow to tradition will you bow to the things that we thought we left will we go back like a dog to its vomit and a hog to its Waller what will you do or will you bow to the Lord to fear Him and to serve him in sincerity and in truth and as we read in some of those later vers vers verses 18 to 21 we find that Joshua is saying well you better serve the Lord because you're not going to be able to live under bondage to these other idols and be successful in possessing the land and it's not so much that God is a narcissist and he's going to punish them if they don't serve him but he's saying this is the rule this is God is going to give you this land because you serve him but if you don't serve him you're inviting the bondage you're inviting the enemy you're inviting uh all the problems that you have when Jesus leaves your home troubles on the way uh but it's because you drive them out and you make them unwelcome so when he says ask for me and my house will serve the Lord even though we could see that God was with them that God was driving the enemy out from before them full possession to maintain possession of the promised land wasn't relying upon a God in heaven but rather he brought it down to what they would be within their home as for me in my house we will serve the Lord if we're going to remain in possession of the promised land it has to begin as for me and my house it's going to be and I love that because if we if we say that together it's not so much just saying well if the wife will get her act together well if the children would get their act together or maybe the child might say oh if the dad will get his act together the wife say oh well the husband and we might just be able to point to someone but how about we say as for me as for me beginning with me in my house we will serve the Lord and that's where that to maintain our position in the promised and defin our position in the promised land begins in the house but as for me and my house that house even word there in the Hebrews a home a household or a family and here is a deliberate decision on Joshua's part and you're all very familiar with it you might even have kind of a nice uh uh um embroidery with this written on it or someone might have got a really good hipster font and put it up there in their their guest bathroom where it says as for me in my house and it's just real beautiful probably get it on Etsy and it's a deliberate decision uh to establish the right kind of order in the middle of all this it's not even in the midst of this challenge he makes this declaration as for me I'm going to serve the Lord as far as my home my household my family we're going to serve the Lord he's making this commitment to establish his heart and his house as a home for the Lord and I'd like to just make a call back to some of the prior services on how it's the order and the character of the house that makes it a home this is Joshua recognized there is a there is an order that matters to fear the lord and to serve him in sincerity and Truth he couldn't just say well we're the children of God We're The Chosen we're the blessed and it was going to work there had to be a recognition of order and a resolve to keep that proper order to maintain a particular position because he he had a duty there couldn't be any letup and no matter how much God has done for you let me challenge you tonight I feel so free to be able to challenge a Wednesday night crowd with this no matter how much God has done for you don't let up if he's brought you through great trials if he's healed you of terrible sicknesses if he's blessed you with wonderful jobs if he's answering the desires of your heart let's not get complacent let's not just settle on on our Lord say oh well look what he's done look what he's done let us recognize that there's still yet more to come amen yes sir I could even say tonight if this if this church was every seat was full with new new converts and people who' been baptized that would be no time to settle and say if God could do this how much more can he do that that ought to be how we face every situation we find ourselves in that when things get a little rough just look at what he's done and be encouraged about what's coming that's right I said this to a brother recently who's just expressing maybe some uncertainty as to his future and different things and I said well with what I've seen God do in your life already I'm kind of excited about what the next part holds I'm not worried I'm not scared I'm kind of thinking this is kind of like Christmas in February uh because who knows what's next God is so good to us let's not up in our believing but this is Joshua saying as for me I will serve the Lord and my house he's saying it started with him we will serve the Lord that's who we will labor for work for that's who we will be subject to that's who I'll bow down to and I'm wanting us to look at that in the sense of order being established now as I was looking over these things I I just feel to share this statement here and I don't know if it's going to be kind of a maybe a rough turn here so just hold on with me but in the sermon total Deliverance Brothers bream says I wonder this morning as Christians if we have yielded our own will and yielded ourselves so completely to God till God can trust us the place that he has put us now Joshua's command to serve God in sincerity and in truth was to put away Gods which they had served before disassociate from the gods of EDP eypt uh don't be brought back into a house of bondage don't serve these new gods and these New Traditions in the land of the amorites and and this is the place where we have been put now let us serve God and bow to him completely and and he says I wonder if we've yielded our will so completely to God till he can trust us in the place that he puts us now there that says a lot about placing and positional placing it's a place it's a matter of trust as we've said before there could be uh there's always that maybe a healthy debate about about what it means to be adopted say well I'm a fully placed adopted son of God when I'm born again wonderful can God trust you and you realize it's a process of maturing and growing with the power that he's given us and then we could also argue in another sense that as a Son of God you're placed under this tutorship of the holy spirit being taught and you're growing in the image of the father and as you grow and mature you're coming to a place of total trust so not no matter how you look at it I'm not so much want to get hung up on the the nomenclature the words to miss the truth the truth is God is wanting to bring us to a place of total Deliverance absolute dependence upon him are we yielded so much till God can trust us in the place that he put us says I wonder this morning of myself if I could be so yielded to God till God could trust me could could trust brother Neville so now he's saying about himself as a prophet now it's about the pastor could trust our trustee board our Deacon board or our members of our church now I like just how he brought us all in this together so nobody's pointing fingers you know the pastor hasn't found this quote so he can just you dirty stinking sheep right and just get all over your case about how you're living and how you're acting and how you're making me look bad if anything the opposite is true you guys make me look pretty good all my friends come in here and preach have such wonderful things to say and I'm over there going hey I'm I'm joking about that part they know it has nothing to do with me they know I'm not even their cup of tea but he says we as he brings everybody in says we all have a place and we got a duty that that's the part that really forms the basis of even using this quot quote we all have a place and we got a duty we all have a place we all have a position but with that position comes Duty and with that Duty become comes responsibility and if we have responsibility without accountability it's all worthless so he says the ministers got a place of Duty to stand and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromising if he's called to be a preacher he wouldn't spare one thing for one person if he's called to be a preacher so if you're called to be a preacher you won't hold back from the word of God for anyone's sake you'll preach the word of God because you're called and if you're a preacher you have a duty to stand and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromising so I could say this about brother Manuel about brother Chris about brother Reggie about brother ly the different ministers that we have amongst us we have a duty as ministers to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromising and we can't hold back just for somebody else's sake we've got to preach the word that's our duty but now you're not going to you may not find yourself in this place of Duty to stand and preach but you find yourself somewhere in here whether a trustee or Deacon or member of a church we say we all have a position and we have a place of Duty that would just be in the house of the Lord but let's let's go a little bit beyond that let's even get in more real we have a position in the calling us housewife husband father mother even in the callings as it was recently mentioned in some of the services how that we might be called to be a particular um uh a a job title or or a different field of work or study these are things that relate to who we are as Christians I would argue that you know tomorrow morning when you leave you don't go you don't leave church and hang up your Christian hat and pick up your cater hat or pick up some other hat and say well I'm a manager at work and and no it's you are a Christian in whatever coling you are and your identity is wrapped up in these things that we do amen and so a phrase that we often hear is post of Duty and I would argue that we most often hear that phrase when when the pastor's trying to keep us at church on Sunday morning and not go visit another meeting but we we often hear this phrase Posta Duty usually related to church you have a poster Duty you have a poster Duty and we're most often told about a poster Duty when it relates to whether you're a pastor trustee Deacon or a member of the church and I will say that is true you have that post but a post of Duty is a it's a duty post it's a place where you work officially I think it even has some military connotation it's your official work side or station the area where one regularly performs duties and I want to make this argument that you have a post a duty not just in the house of God but in your life in your daily life a duty is an act or course of action that's required by your position by custom law religion so we all have a duty in in the way that God has made us he says we all have a place and we got a duty not just in church but in who God has made you as an individual as for me and my house so that the me in that has a place and a duty even within the house to purpose to serve the Lord so that post of Duty that act or course of action that's required by your position that post is the position of Duty or employment or the trust to which one is assigned or appointed and I'm I I'm say this tonight we're just going to have a few moments together this evening I'm not expecting to be lengthy by any definition but we have a post of Duty and that post is is not just related to church as for me and my house we'll serve the Lord was not a declaration as to where Joshua's going to go to church he's saying the Lord will be the one that we are bound to and this is our posting this is our posting as Believers our post to duty is to the word cannot have this H uh idea to where church becomes so preeminent and there's such loyalty to the pastor and there's such loyalty to tradition that we're willing to compromise the word of God to be loyal to our post we cannot let the devil get that in our heads I'd much rather you obey the Lord and do what God wants you to do than to just stick it out here since we're a young Church be where God wants you to be we want you to succeed we said in the beginning and those who are here for the beginning can bear witness to this I hold myself accountable to this that our desire is to see that the perfect will of God is fulfilled in the hearts of his children and if we're just here for a moment to help somebody along the way we rejoice in the fact that we had a part in it we would never want to develop a culture that would restrain somebody from being successful in obeying God's word or being at their post this word is our posting brother bam takes this scripture and says he's the word and he will ever be the word and for me and my house will serve the word this is the first Duty for the individual and for the family I've said it before I can't remember in what part uh what series it was over the last uh few years that we mentioned it but that there's this idea of focus on the family and I'm not trying to call out Colorado Springs but there's this idea of focus on the family and that's good if you're focused on the word but we could actually turn away from the will of God God by focusing on our family we want to be a family focused on the word so there there's maybe a little bit of retitling they can do but someone hurry up and trade mark that get the URL family focused on the word is what we want to be not just focused on the family where oh it's just all about the family all about the kids all about this all no that's not a do we want to obey the word of God brother Bram in the sermon um blind barus he says speaking of barus he was a provider for his family he thought of his family first before himself any rude any any real true dadle any real true dad will do that or husband any Christian I love this so it's not just us dads any Christian will think of others before himself I'm really feeling impressed to hit at the selfishness that Leo DEA tries to weave into our minds we're so much about our own identification and what we like and what we feel and I'm made a certain way or I need certain things we've got to break out of the selfishness and even brother Jason touched on it quite a bit we can't be selfish we've got to break out of a selfish mindset because eternal life is living for others not for yourself any real true dad will do that or husband any Christian will think of others before himself every Christian tries to put God first his family second he's number three that's why I even take a little issue with the I am second movement isn't that is that what it's called called I Am Second or whatever the whatever those those different ones are what would Jesus do there he's saying I'm I'm number three God first family second and I'm number three this is this is what I could even hearken him back to what brother Jason ministered over the weekend in marriage of the Alpha and Omega and those two different parts what a what an encouragement sermon encouraging sermon to know that if in a relationship with anyone especially husband to wife that if things aren't where they're supposed to be the the measure of Correction can be found in reestablishing your connection to the word that marital problems are often symptomatic of something being wrong in your relationship to Christ some misunderstanding in your view of Christ some misunderstanding in what the word requires of you some distance in your relationship to Christ you say oh I don't think my marriage can ever be fixed and and maybe you don't have a lot of things you can grab a hold of to the promise for your marriage but Christ has made an unconditional Covenant with you that he'll never leave you nor forsake you and is doing all that he can to see that that relationship he has with you is firmed up is restored is made right is clean and so then you could go to him and say Lord fix whatever it is between you and I and know that that can have a healing effect on what we are in our relationship to other people that way I could even say this whether it be to you to a sibling or mother to uh child to parent whatever it might be Focus first on your relationship to Christ as for me am I serving the lord and in then that we're saying I'm going to put Christ first my my first post is to the word try to put God first and then family second and I and F and then myself number three is how he orders it so our first duty is to God we could take from this and even as to what I'm trying to point out here as for me I will serve the Lord and my house now Joshua was turning his attention to his house not himself so much I will be subject to the Lord and now I will serve my house in a way that brings them subject to the word because our next duty is to home every Christian tries to put God first his family second himself number three in Luke Chapter 24: 47 this is very simple I'm just going to try try to kind of walk through this a little bit it's just a very simple thought as we continue further in this to see where our duty is first in Luke CH 24:47 I believe this is on the road to Emmas and as he's uh expounding on the prophecies he makes a statement which not only refers to where he's at in his own Ministry and what he was doing but uh this is more to the right just before his Ascension even as this is this is a lot here that we could be reading but I think I'm just going to pull this one scripture here so this is after his resurrection this is where he's speaking to the uh uh the children of Israel or speaking to the disciples soon going to be uh ascended up he's going to open up their understanding the scripture he says and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem notice how he says this as he's going to as he's gone through this and I realized maybe there was a lot more here that I could have expressed for time sake I'll just pull this part out here as he's coming to the conclusion of his Earthly Ministry he's going to send up he's not going to be with them anymore he's tell them what's to come as he's going to give them the Great Commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel says and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations and he says beginning at Jerusalem they were to go out and preach to all the world but he doesn't send them out to the world first he tells them to start in Jerusalem it must begin at Jerusalem and in Acts chap 1:8 it says but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me but not just uh uh in Jerusalem he says both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and under the uttermost part of the earth so what we could see here is that God wanted Jesus wanted that this gospel would go to all the world but he's not just going to send them to the world first he sends them home first that's right he sends them to Jerusalem first you got to start at home he says the gospel's got to be preached the gospel's got to be lived but the most effective place you want it to be first the place that you want to have a testimony the place where you want to begin to establish it is within your own personal individual life it's amazing sometimes how there's people who give Li lip service to Christ are always witnessing they're always sharing these things but their lives are shambles they won't humble themselves to the word of God they don't apply the token to their home they don't love their wives as they ought to there's a whole mess at home but they use this this language in their mouth uh uh to lift up the Lord and give these platitudes and try to have some sort of Fain humility or a sincerity and where it got it needs to begin first is at home Amen Let The Gospel be preached and expressed first at Jerusalem so it starts at home there's your Jerusalem then once it's being witnessed at home then Judea there's your neighborhood there's your job there's school there's the local there's the little bit broader expansion then Samaria maybe it gets a little bit bigger State County however you want to look at it and then the world but it's got to first start at home what what witness in Ministry do you really have in the world if you come back home and there's no Ministry Min it's identifying the proper order of things I really believe it's pointing to what God values beginning at Jerusalem that our duty is to God and what God wants us to first begin to have a testimony is at home in 1 Timothy chapter 3: we start with verse 2 to13 it says I'm going to read this together maybe look at a few points as we go now speaking of a pastor says a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife now why why does it have that requirement breakout session anybody want to debate this he must be blameless that's a mouthful but it says the husband of one wife now the reason why he is to be husband of one wife is because he's going to teach you right going to teach marriage and remarriage going to teach marriage and the consequences of divorce and it is he is not going to be affected because the teaching is a establish in righteousness the throne is established in righteousness and what kind of hypocrisy would it be to say hey I know I got a couple wives but you shouldn't have any more than one right his life undermines his example undermines and so the scripture tells us that what God values and what how a pastor should be in his own life speaks to what God values in the teaching the husband of one wife and then notice Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach there's a little bit of a misunderstanding maybe where we say the Deacon should be apt to teach but that's just a remnant of the bylaws of brandom Tabernacle it's the bishop that should be apt to teach says not given to Wine no Striker not greedy a filthy ler but patient not a brawler not Covetous these are the characteristics that a pastor should have this is one that ruleth well his own house having his own his children in subjection with all gravity now that word gravity means honesty y that which entitles one a person to respect so it's not that he rules his house as a dictator not that he's been able to scare every person into that house into doing what he wants him to do but he rules the house in such a way to where they respect him they have respect for him so these are the qualifications for a pastor one that ruleth well his own house having his own children subjection with all gravity with all honesty with respect and then this statement I'm not really trying to put myself on the hot seat by reading those few verses there but I wanted to come to this for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God Amen now as we've used this before we've shown that it's not the fact that the man's a pastor that gives him full Sway in the right to be respected within his home it's not the office that he has spiritually the office that he might have in the church that demands and requires the respect at home but rather his life at home is what would give rise to his suitability to be a pastor if a man doesn't know how to rule his house correctly not with an iron fist not as a dictator not abusing his children not being verbally abusive not being a brawler not being a striker not being greedy a filthy lcer not having good behavior if all these other things are wrong if he doesn't know how to rule his own life if he doesn't how to rule his own house how then can you expect him to take care of the Church of God then it continues not a novice L being lifted up with the pride he fall the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them which are without this is a this is quite a statement does he have a good testimony amongst those he deals with in public is he known as a a businessman who cheats is he known as a liar is he known as a brawler is he known as one that's rude and and arrogant I mean this is he said he's got to have a testimony not just be able to uh wow you when he's behind the the pulpit what about his life lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil likewise must the deacons be grave not double tonged not given too much wine not greedy of filthy lucer the deacons fill on the hot seat yet I mean I got it on me now we let's just keep moving on here hold in the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless this is Paul I know there's a lot here that you could unpack a lot that can be attributed to deacons a lot that we could attribute to the office of a pastor but I'm wanting you to recognize that in the eyes of Paul the life that one lived at home amongst his family and amongst the people was the life that mattered most because if this was chaotic it wouldn't do any good in the house of God it wasn't just make a man a deacon and then you just give the seal of approval that whatever he says and whatever he does is right and we just kind of lift certain people in this Echelon and create an elite class in the house of God they first must be proved and then I love how as he said these things about a deacon he says even so their wives beg graved that mean doesn't mean in the grave even so must their wise beg graved not slanderer sober faithful in all things this means that the wife shouldn't be a busy body I would say the pastor or the deacons shouldn't be one that's always talking and running things down and the one that you could get the scoop from they shouldn't be an expert in the tea but even so must their wives be grave not slander sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own house as well why because if their house isn't right what they're doing in the oppos at church isn't going to be right as he's already said lest they fall in reproach or lest they fall into condemnation in other words if things aren't where they should be at home it get provides a source of weakness in the office at church in a de it's true for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree wow and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus and because of that it's so important that the home be right first brother brandham even talks about it if in a situation where if something happened he said would take me out of the pulpit and and it wasn't it was him just recognizing that if if these things happened then then I'm losing I I I lose the confidence of the people and and things begin to lose their order and so I could I would argue whether we want to call it Church order or the church office whether it be Deacon or trustee and any any other office that we could find especially that of a pastor the church order can cannot undermine family order good amen we don't establish Church order as a means of usurping family order as a matter of fact we're taught that the women are to learn at home and that tells me that when it says they're not to speak or to usurp Authority in the house of God it's not to create another husband at church no right not at all but it's to establish it in the home the man ought to be in his place and that the woman's to learn at home it establishes a different order meaning that what you might have at church isn't the ultimate but a family is the ultimate that church order does not flip upside down family order as a matter of fact Church order is just a type of family order therefore we don't sacrifice the family for the church that's beautiful we're not sacrificing our families for it because it's duty to the family first because if family isn't right service to church isn't right good service to church is not what gives you a good testimony a good testimony at home qualifies you for service at church a good testimony amongst others a good testimony in your family qualifies you for a greater service for an office in the church it's not it doesn't work the other way around that you just put someone in office and that kind of they're they to be trusted they're to be believed they're to have the authority well because they're this and they're that and the F and the church that means they have a particular respect and Authority you respect the office but a man gains that respect when he lives the kind of life before his family brother says lives the kind of life that the family can respect so it's a good testimony at home that qualifies us for service in church brother Brandon says in the token we are responsible to him not to a church we are responsible to God and to his word and God is the word the Bible said he was we're responsible to that so again I I'm just taking this time tonight to show that our duty is at home first as for me and my house will serve the Lord and if we could have that part if that part could be understood oh man it makes it so much better at home as brother Jason even emphasized I I thought it was wonderfully encouraging to see the continuity of the things that have been ministered lately how that we we uh a church is not made up a strong church is made up of strong families is how we were putting it and the same thing that brother Jason came and repeated that really the strength of a church is is found in the strength of the unions that make up the families and we're responsible to him as for me and my house will'll serve the Lord it's not just this commitment to go to church it's a commitment to serve God that's it brother that's what we're responsible to Titus Chapter 1 veres 6 7 and 8 and it's talking about in verse 5 he's talking about ordaining Elders in all the cities where they were lacking pastors so it shows us that this was something that was needful and if any any man or Bishop be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not a accused of Riot or unruly not being lwd fellas of the baser sort not accused of of rebellion and Disobedience and those words there accused of r or unruly for Bishop must be blameless as the steward of God noce not self-willed not soon angry not given to Wine no Striker not given to Filthy lcer but a lover of hospitality a lover of Good Men sober just holy temper he keeps going and in Titus he's establishing the role of Pastor as men uh women children he's showing that we all have a duty we all have a post in our own individual lives that we've got to keep the the his marital relationship matters and if it matters I would say the reason why it would matter for the pastor is because it matters for all of us it matters for all of us I think that I if I could say this I want to be able to say this the right way if you make brother brandham your pastor you've given yourself the biggest excuse to live your life however you want because he's he's gone all we have is the tapes we press play and Obey he's my pastor you do that because you don't want to change you do that because you want to just do the minimum of play a tape and just nod your head right but when God when God brings us together as humans and we're all in this together and we're striving for the same thing together and God doesn't give you a pastor H who's dead and in the grave and can't answer questions or God just doesn't give you a pastor that you listen to on tape but it gives you one with Humanity gives you one with family gives you one with relationships and you realize we're in This Together the reason why God has requirements for office isn't because those in office are special though brother Bram says he's a special man it's because we're all called to a standard of the word of God and we want to meet the mark in this age together yes and so these responsibilities as a husband of one wife and ruling our homes with all gravity and all these different things it doesn't mean that the W the Deacon's wife shouldn't be slanderers Nobody's Wife should be a slanderer right the sister shouldn't leave tonight like thank God I'm not married to a deacon right nobody nobody should be leaving tonight saying man I'm glad I'm not the pastor or Deacon I can get as married many times as I want and my wife can be a gossiper no these standards are there because of the influence because of the example because we would say let us none of us be subject to these things let's strive together for these things that's right so it's the image that's being created within the house of the Lord as an example for what God wants to achieve in your own individual lives as for me in my house in 1 Timothy 5:8 as we come back to Timothy as Paul is expressing these things to Timothy you find such beautiful symmetry between Timothy and Titus but he says it this way but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he ha denied the faith and is worse than an Infidel if we could put it in the same vein of 1 Timothy chapter 3 that a bishop must be blameless a husband of one wife and Vigilant sober good behavior given to hospitality and all these things not given to wine all these different characteristics that don't describe him as much behind the pulpit it says he's apt to teach and we can say oh well that's teaching behind the pulpit but really everything that's mentioned here has to do with his personal life and his testimony not among church folk but people in the community and abroad and even the same about the Deacon's wife we realize that what saying if any man provide not for his own especially for those of his own house he Deni he's denied the faith and is worse than an infid we can say that it's the life at home his testimony amongst his family his relationship with his wife and his children matter because if he for forsakes that if he does not provide for his own especially of his own family he denies the Faith No matter how much lip service we could give if we don't provide first for our own and for our families we deny the faith and is worse than an Infidel now that's you know chew on that for a few seconds worse than an Infidel so it emphasizes the importance of the duty we have to our house true we could we could take this and we could look at in the sense of a man who works and provides therefore if he's not feeding his wife he's not feeding his children if he's not taking care of his his family and then those in the household of faith he denies the faith and we're looking at maybe in provision and care but I believe it means more than that brother bam said in talking about the Tabernacle says this is a nice building and and we've done a lot to make the outside look good but it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God and just as he drew that parallel about A House Is Not a Home Without order and character it's our duty to make the inside of the house right by the grace of God I didn't provide these quotes in uh in the slide Deck with you but listen to this if you could we're just about finished here brother bandam says in 1964 make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their house and make home so happy they'll be pleased in their home to stay there amen that's a challenge and talk about a challenge he's not saying hey you know what you need to compromise right you need to get the Netflix premium and you need to get a big screen you need to do this in order to keep your kids at home he's not saying that but I believe it tells us there's a way that we can conduct ourselves without compromising to make our home nice to make our home a place where our children want to bring their friends a place where they're happy to be and pleased to stay am and that's not going to be accomplished by bowing to the world and it's not going to be accomplished by you being a dictator but it can only be accomplished by you serving the lord and saying oh God help me to be a home builder help me to be a home maker that I may make my home nice for my family this is a commandment post seals if I could put it that way to make our homes happy for our children cuz it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God you have more influence you have a greater connection to your children because your Nature's in them to bring out the best in them to form relationships with them to make them feel secure to make them happy and not just pushing it off to the technology of this world not just pushing it off to the things of the world but be present with your children establishing real good relationships have a meeting of the minds with them talk to them communicate with them have things that you do together and your children even if it's not flashy even if it's not entertainment even if it's not expensive even if it's not gaming systems and music and movies there's a way that you as a parent can bond with your child that makes a house a home hallu say Amen if God's done it for you and your family amen says in the message influence again this is in November 63 oh to a home if we made home more lovely children wouldn't want to run away make things more for them where they feel welcome and nice and comfortable at home we're home they can't hardly wait till they get there Elliot why are you leaving that was horrible timing son just horrible can't hardly wait to leave make can feel welcome and nice and com he knows I'm coming to an end I he might be playing the everybody's leaving now hold on wait or they feel welcome and nice and comfortable at home we're home they can't hardly wait till they get there and that's the way home should be can I get a witness isn't that the way it should be children right anybody who's ever lived in a home that's always tension and on edge and you're afraid of how dad's going to fly off the handle or mom's going to do this and do that horrible place to be that's right and where does that start it's not the kids getting their act right it's us as the men in the house first and as for me I'll serve the Lord amen parents binding their hearts together so let's make this home nice let let our love for each other become an example for our children a home more lovely where children don't want to run away where things are for them where they feel welcome nice and comfortable at home again that's a challenge because we don't want to just compromise and let the children run the house but it tells us there's a way that we can rule amen that the children feel at peace the children feel at home he said that's the way home should be has anybody ever heard the phrase charity begins at home I think we probably have all heard that before it's interpreted to mean one's first responsibility is for the needs of the family and I think it's most often used in the sense that our giving should be first to our own and and and in terms of giving and financial worth or even as the Bible says if any man provide not for his own charity begins at home that I've got to give food to my family first I got to provide their clothing and I got to pay the bills and then if I have any left over then I'll give to a charity but you know it often for most people since they interpret it that way it just means that it ends there as well not only does it begin there it ends there but it has a greater meaning charity begins at home isn't just in giving or providing natural things but Charity's learned at home love begins at home charity is first planted and cultivated at home when we say charity begins at home it's exactly what Jesus said meant I say exactly please forgive me but let me just make the connection the gospel must be preached to All Nations first at Jerusalem preach the gospel to All Nations live it first at home because it's going to begin at home first no man should be preaching the gospel unless he's first met God On The Backs side of the desert and that's not just an experience for a preacher it's an experience for all of us we must have first met God On The Backs side of the desert our hearts must first be a home to him if we're ever going to make our dwelling a home and then we bring that responsibility these Gates of Heaven we bring this responsibility down to where I must first be responsible at home because charity is first learned at home these great Christian virtues are first planted at home and cultivated at home Ephesians 533 nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself in other words husbands love your wives and wife see that she reverence her husband why because love is first leared at home respect respect is learned at home amen responsibility honesty all these things you name it is first learned at home obedience at home leads to obedience abroad that's why we say as for me in my house I'll serve the Lord in other words as for me in my home this is where it begins because home building and home making is God's way of expressing his word amen and we could and then and if I'll say it this way just so you understand my burden Vision even saying these things at church we're to be taught the word we learn these things at the house of God in the house of God we're taught the word of God but then when we go home that's where we put it into practice that's where it matters the most if if I could if I could put it this way and to use a sports analogy which I know nobody hears into sports uh that a team practices throughout the whole week week in order to play the game in football at least or in these different inters they practice in order to play the game in football there's practice Monday Tuesday all the way through played the game on Sunday and I think football's kind of crept into churches anymore we're all Monday to Saturday is is just build up for church and we've got it completely backwards and and we've turned we've turned even our church services into pep rallies for the climactic game on and that's not what it's all about we come to church and this is where we're learning this is where we study this is the word is rightly divided and the various gifts that come take things from the word of God and brother bam says a Minister's got a duty to search to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromise because you as a Believer listening to that word of God and then when you go home you're actually playing the game that's where you're putting into practice all that you've practiced and that's why we talk about practice it's for the playoffs it's for the payoff at home at church we learn the word but at home we live it am and if it isn't practice at home on we're just playing church we might as well just call this magic the Gathering right Pokemon Tabernacle how does that sound Doom Lings Fellowship Moon raker Church am I missing anybody's favorite card game might as well I know it sounds funny but it's true if we're not if we're not living the life this is just a card game this is a bingo parlor this is a bowling alley that's right it's got to be practiced at home it's true we could say a lot more but we'll save it when everyone else is here on Sunday praise the Lord because maybe someone say it's not fair that it gets tight like that on a Wednesday night but you know you're the ones that are putting it into practice amen you're the ones that know what it means to that kids eat free because your kids got to get up early in the morning and they're here you got to drive an hour to get back home probably get up early to go to work brother John you probably got have to get 3:30 in the morning probably to fly an airplane and people are here they they got schedules they got lives they live different families drive along distances even even ones that they spend their time in the nursery on a on a Wednesday night but they're here because they want their children here they're recognizing the value of the things of God not because they love church but because they love the Lord and they want to live overcoming lives and they recognize the value of the word in moments like this are helping them to overcome God help us maybe this could be our prayer as the musicians come to their instruments this is a prayer that brother brandham prays and does God ever change his mind about his word he says dear Lord Jesus maybe you can make this a prayer just in your hearts now thinking of this dear Lord Jesus we are assembled again in your name with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of God and listen to these beautiful words to bring us into recognition of our position and place and our responsibilities as being a called people separated from the world dedicated to God think of this language the outpouring or the quickening power of God and maybe he doesn't go to the place that a lot of us might think he means when he talks like that but it's to bring us to the ultimate a recognition of our position in place a recognition of our responsibilities our responsibilities as called people the quickening power of God to separate us from the world to be dedicated to God grant Lord tonight that the blessings of God will guide gu us and direct us in the things we do or say that it might bring honor and glory to your name amen now that's what I want the quickening power of God to do I believe in the power of God to restore limbs I believe in the power of God to cause a cancer to dissipate like that I believe in the power of God to make cross eyes straight I believe in the power of God to raise the dead I believe in miracles signs and wonders the manifestations of the gifts gifts operate in the church whether you want tongues or prophecies I believe that our worship ought to have feeling in it believe in all those things but at the end of the day the ultimate of the outpouring of the quickening power of God is that he would guide us and direct us in the things we do or say that it might bring honor and glory to his name oh May there be an outpouring of the quickening power of God to bring us into recognition of our position and place to know our responsibilities because we are a called people separated from the world dedicated to God oh I will bow no more to the world but I will serve God as for me in my home we will serve we will bow to the Lord do we need help oh we need we need his help stand today with me
