TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Daniel chapter 3 I'm going to read verses 1 to 20 and I'm doing this as a way of hopefully creating um some motivation to get to this I've had this in my notes the last few services and just haven't been able to get to them and I've debated on whether or not I should just start uh with this story in Daniel but I I I'd like to conclude with the these examples here and so we'll just read these verses Daniel chapter 3 veres 1 to 20 that way we recently heard it by the time we arrive at the story at the end Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of Duran in the province of Babylon now we know that uh this is an image of Daniel and we could see the example in scripture because in verse 48 it said the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him a ruler and so it's no uh no strange thing that this image in verse one of chapter 3 would be an image of a prophet or Daniel it says then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up then the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together into the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had said set up and they stood before the image of Nebuchadnezzar that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded oh people Nations and languages that at the time you hear the sound of the corette flute harp sackbut Sultry duler and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and who so falleth not down and worship not the same hour be cast into the midst of a fire burning fiery furnace therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornette flute harp sackbut Sultry and all kinds of music and all the people the Nations and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up it almost reads like the 12 Days of Christmas because you keep repeating the same things over and over again as they're added to the story wherefore all that time certain calans came near and accused the Jews they spake and said to King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever thou oh King H has made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornette flute harp sack butut Sultry ulur and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image who so fth not down and worship that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery perace there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image what thou has set up so there's this peer pressure this influence everyone's doing the same thing and these few refuse to do do so then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do not you serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if you be ready that at the time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sacet Sultry duler and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury in the form of his Visage was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it had want to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and abedo and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace amen we trust that the Lord will bless these things which we've read you can have your seats I'm giving a title to the sermon today integrity and I'll give it just a little bit of background of where I'm coming from on this as we've been approaching things from the standpoint of Art and artworks and even the artist and God himself being the the original artist I was looking at the concepts of recently when we ministered on ruined and how something can become ruined and become desolate and cast down and when it comes to Art there's a process whereby they uh will restore artwork involves repairing that image to return it to or that artwork to its original state and one of the things uh that I found coming up most often is I was looking at uh possibly ministering or using the subject of modesty restored and I was I was looking at this I found that one of the common themes that kept coming up over and over again in one area that I was studying in the word of God was integrity and one of the themes when it comes to maintaining restoring our work is maintaining the original Integrity of that artwork and if you change the Integrity of it then you lose the whole concept of restoration loses its point and so there's even a code of ethics that govern how a piece of art is restored and and the the phrase is used to its original integrity and by original Integrity they mean preserving the artist intent uh the materials that were used and even the same technique so that you don't change what is being represented and so I decided to show you I wanted to show you an example here of what not to do do when you're restoring a piece of art this was from a church in Spain and this was a painting on the left is the way that it was looked even in modern times and the paint begin to chip away and begin to fade and um an 80-year-old woman took it upon her heart to restore art and this is what it looked like after she was done and it was entitled eomo on the left and after she was done uh they called it eimo which is behold the man to behold the monkey and you could tell that this restoration process didn't quite go the way that it should it caused quite an uproar uh the lady that did it uh she took great offense cuz she said that she had restored it to a point and then went on vacation and before she could get back and finish it uh it already became a worldwide spectacle and you could tell the piece of work on the right is not a restoration of what you see on the left you'd probably prefer this over the other and what someone would do if they're trying to restore this image they would want to look at what the artist originally intended look at the colors it used the techniques it's used it used and even do everything it can to restore its original Integrity so that when it's restored or made new or fresh or more vibrant it it's not a departure from what the original artist intended and so that's what we refer to as the original Integrity of the artist and what I'm wanting to look at today is integrity and I'm wanting to look at it in the standpoint of the scripture and then even uh kind of uh building off of what we ministered on a couple Sundays ago on integrity and it's that condition of being without blemish uh where one is complete or sound they're they're upright they're whole that's what integrity means in the Old Testament is the condition of being without blemish to be complete to be whole and when we looked at the subject of Ruin we discussed scriptures related to how a man or woman ought to dress we're drawing from Deuteronomy 22 and we looked at the concept of how that clothing surrounds the body and covers the body but depending on how you wear it and how you how that clothing is made and worn it can also disclose and discover the body so just because you have a piece of garment a garment on or a piece of fabric on doesn't necessarily mean you're covered because you could wear it in a manner to where it's suggestive or it actually discovers the body and we looked in the scripture and we saw that Christians should dress in a way that complement their nature their god-given nature their gender uh their role their purpose and even their relationships to others Deuteronomy chapter 22:5 says the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God this is different than all the miscellaneous laws that say one ought to do this and one out to do that this puts it in the category of God's opinion of those that would C would would wear that Garment of the opposite gender and it's something in a nature of a God who never changes and we know that modest apparel is what God values it's what he uh what he puts great price on as the scripture tells us and this scripture also relates to modest apparel also relates to the respect that we have for ourselves and for others and it's a key point in the scripture that we have to see so we were looking at it from two different elements we looked at the principle of roles what headship and identity we saw that very plain in the scripture that God is asking us to dress a particular way because as men we have a particular role as women we have a particular role and we dress in a way that's complimentary to that and doesn't confuse it saw that over and over again in the scripture and the other element is the principle of modesty we haven't really looked too greatly into this we stopped short of it last time but on the principle of modesty is one of these these guiding factors in in dressing a particular way and has to do with sexual attraction so the principles of modesty are contrasted by and even tied to the power of sexual attraction and I hope that we can really uh consider this in a mature way today in Proverbs 7: 6-2 we read this the last time we ministered on the subject for at the window of my house I looked through my casement and beheld among the simple ones I discerned among the youths a man void of understanding passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house and in the Twilight in the evening in the black and dark night and behold there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot and subtle of heart she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house now she's without now in the streets and lith in weight at every corner we could see here that this woman is obviously uh has inappropriate motives this is improper Behavior it says that she has a subtle heart she's loud and stubborn and she abides not in her house so there's something where she is being rebellious to her calling and her position and she has these improper motives and it says she wears the attire of a harlot whether it was something very showy or Gody or something very short or tight or revealing the word signifies that she was wearing clothing fitted to her body well-shaped to recommend her she was dressing in a way that would recommend her body that would show it off that would advertise it and harlot in the scripture could be one of two different persons one who was either motivated by lust or motivated for gain and think of that in terms of one who might do it just to satisfy their desires and one who might do it for gain and this dressing here this attire of a harlot it's that phrase that I found as I was looking into this dressing that is a form of objectification in service of the male gaze to cause one to stare to cause one to be attracted and as this is this is so for both men and women what we wear should not appeal to the lust of the eyes nor should we dress in a way that would cater to the pride of life these are things that the scripture speaks of and enforces over and over again that there must be modesty in the way that we dress this modesty is this restraint by this sense of humility or propriety where you have a moderate self-regard this is what modesty begins with you you look at yourself in a way to where you have a moderate opinion of yourself and because you have a moderate opinion of yourself you're not trying to broadcast you're not trying to advertise you're not trying to show off and at the same time you're not attention seeking because you have respect for others so modesty demonstrates the proper regard of yourself but also a proper respect for others in Isaiah 3:1 16 we'll read verse 16 and then here in a moment we'll pick up and read to verse 24 but this is a a very obvious scripture and a very well-known scripture when it comes to modesty and how that a woman would dress appreciate your patience today as we just try to pla through this it says moreover the Lord saith because the daughters of Zion are hottie and wal with stretched forth necks and wanting eyes so hotess is at the heart of this because because modesty in spirit is going to be a complement to modesty in dress that if someone's not modest in spirit it can certainly overcome whatever clothing they've tried to cover up their body with it says want I walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet this word mencing uh describes a manner of walk and it's descriptive of one wearing high heels brother bam even takes this scripture to describe the same and we could we could spend a lot of time getting into uh uh you know high heels and those things and I found that the longer I lived that there can be very legalistic attitudes towards it to where any heel at all is a high heel and then there's also the context historically of the things that brother brandham has identifying but even within fashion and Academia and not just in the religious realm but high heels of a certain length at some point begin to cause a woman to Arch her back and extend her backside out and her face forward and the Bible's describing a similar G and I believe that all of us uh well I guess I don't know how common it is these days and uh but as you look at this uh from a historical standpoint high heels are considered to be a sex symbol at least a modern sex symbol and they in in Reading even the fashion design and intent behind it that it accentuates sex specific aspects of a female walk so it artificially inflates uh the look of a female it's a and it actually is tied to certain behaviors in nature and even to the woman that it was an imitation of a woman's desire to be courted in other words a woman's desire to get the attention of a man we all on the same page today are we all smelling the beans that are cooking and the knowledge that brother Travis smoked another brisket and we're all wanting to put that in our taco shell and so we're thinking about that not high heels well for a moment humor me at least and and and having a very serious discussion about modesty and I'm not approaching it from the same same standpoint where I I to get up here and just rail to purple my face about split skirts and short skirts and tight clothing and high heels no that's we're not uh deacons are not to be clothing police pastors aren't supposed to uh be worried about what's in your wardrobe and in your closets this is for believers to consider I'm only responsible for the word of God to preach the word of God and then for you to process it hopefully the holy spirit's grabbing a hold of it and so there is a point at which even your Footwear can begin to cross a line and maybe a Tipping Point where certain things begin to happen to your walk and to your look that is originally meant to cause an attraction and these are things that we may not be thinking about but they matter and in 1 Corinthians 7: 29 Paul says but this I say Brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none and then he begins to get into these different you that do this you that do that do the opposite so in essence we read this to say that married men should act as if they were single and all of a sudden married men say brother brand preached the same gospel Paul preached and and this is the end time and time is short and this is my excuse to live single but then he explains this later and as we've looked at verse 31 quite a bit you'll see how much this fits within this thought on fashion and modesty they that use this world is not abusing it we have to get something out of this world but we are not to try to get everything we can out of it for the fashion of this world passeth away can even see how that Fashions change so dramatically a a and they're always changing he says but I would have you without carefulness now he begins to explain what he means by he that is married act as if he's unmarried he that is unmarried Mar careth for the things that belong to the Lord how he may please the Lord so if you're not married today then you ought to have an attitude that your primary goal is to please God now Paul then acknowledges that when a man is married things change he that is married care for things that are of the world how he may please his wife so we get what we can out of the world but we don't get everything we can out of the world because our interest in the world isn't to be benefited by it but however to take care of those that we are responsible to in this instance he cares about the things of the world and what the world has so that he can take care of his wife so his duty is not to the world his duty is to his wife there is a difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman carth for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit so as a single lady your desire is to please the Lord both in body and in spirit the way you dress the way you live the way you act single if you're single today you your primary objective is to dress to live to act to speak and to pursue your course in this world putting God first how that you may please the Lord Paul then acknowledges the challenge that a a married woman will face she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband and what I want to point out I think it's very obvious in reading this is that if you're single you act and dress to please God if you're married you act to please your spouse and to take care of your spouse and you would dress also in consideration too your spouse that if anyone is dressing with the idea that they want to attract the male gaze or to attract the attention of another man they're not living for their husband or for their mate so your your duty is first to God and as you have a duty to God it moderates your behavior and what you pursue and how you dress and how you act and then he that is married he then maybe would think I want to live this way or act this way for my wife then Paul's takes a step back and he kind of solves all of it and says how about we just all live to serve God and the rest will take care of itself that though we may be tempted to live in a way that I to get out of the world what we can in order to please our spouse and take care of our spouse let us live as a single man would caring about the things of God the things that belong to the Lord how we may please the Lord and the Bible teaches us the rest will be added to us but there is a way that we could be tempted to dress if we're single to dress in a way that would get the attention of the opposite sex and that would be wrong there is then a way that we could dress even as a married person that inappropriately broadcasts or signals things that would get the attention of the opposite sex and that would be wrong so there is this glorification and this lifting up of self and the flesh which forsakes God's desire for the individual and it's opposite the image of God's beauty that he that he loves we could look into the history of uh the Garment that pertains to a man and how that in France it said that it was a woman had to ask for permission to wear pants and that was the phrase that they used a garment that pertained to a man was pants and a woman wearing pants is actually was a sign of of a symbol of rebellion against the patriarchy the status quo and so the the very idea that a woman would wear a man's garment was s was symbolizing her overthrowing uh misogyny or chauvinism and there's been a lot of nasty things done in the name of that but just even trying to upt overturn the the their relationship to man to not create a compliment but to create a forced equality right so continuing in verse 17 because there are hottie and walk with stretch forth necks and wanting eyes walking and mincing as they go making a tinkling with their feet this uh the there's this shorter gate this step that takes place a certain way that it accentuates the female figure that's what's being described in this now let's look at it too there's a overall attitude this hotess stretched forth necks wanting eyes now this is God's response therefore the Lord will Smite with the scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion here is their their dereliction their forsaking of Duty their unfaithfulness because they've Left Behind the Lord now they're going to be ruined God is going to bring ruin upon them they're going to Smite them and the Lord will discover their secret Parts in that day the Lord will take away The Bravery so here's their hotess their their forwardness the their attention seeking Behavior The Bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their halls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the Mufflers the bonnets I feel like I'm going between the garage and the the salon here the Bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands the tablets and the earrings the Rings and nose Jewels the changeable suits of apparel and The Mantel and the Whip wimples and the crisping pins the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the veils and this is just one outfit right here it's it's been described in one and this is what God's doing it's their fashion which symbolize their Rebellion the way they dressed they were trying to give give some sort of signal they could take care of themselves uh they get attention we're powerful and God is sorely displeased he says it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink instead of a girdle a rent and instead of a well set hair baldness that and that alone should be caution enough for us to dress right I I wish I could have well set hair but instead its baldness and instead of a stomacher a giring of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty this is God's allowing ruin upon those who would forsake his way being unfaithful becoming hottie it's expressed in the way that they dress and a change of the way that they look God is allowing that that even all their Fashions and all their efforts will come to ruin now the question could be asked and we might in this day and age ask ourselves well what's the danger right not trying to back into an answer here but God has given these standards for a reason it's for uh the modesty humility these different principles that relate to God he has the same character uh that he's wanting to see in us so there is a danger in dressing in an in modest way there's a way there's a danger in dressing provocatively there's a danger in dressing in a way that's deceptive where you are giving the appearance and suggesting things that are not so and in Matthew 5: 28 this is what connects to me very uh specific to the power of sexual attraction and how that the Bible requires a certain manner of dress for the principles of modesty but it says I say unto you Matthew 5:28 that whosoever lookth on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart we understand according to the Old Testament the penalty with penalty for adultery was death so this is no light thing so whosoever lookth on a woman to lust that's to turn upon a thing so there's to long for something forbidden or to turn upon a thing it says that there is a crossing of a line if there's something forbidden there's a line that is crossed I believe that we could uh look at it from the standpoint that it's not that if a man sees a woman who's dressed inappropriately or dressed suggestively that he's committed adultery but there's a line that he can cross when he looks to lust he crosses this line for something that is forbidden the very word lookth means to discover with the mind's eye so it's not just to see but it's to contemplate to weigh carefully or to examine and there's a way that we ladies could dress or women could dress however you want to whatever term you want to use that is going to cause the person to look and to gaze and to contemplate to draw attention to cause you to to look longer than you ought to so that to look here is not just to see but to cause them to wait carefully to examine to draw attention to and it would hold in first Thessalonians 4: 5 and 6 and I'm wanting to make this point that this relates to principles of modesty whether it be garments that reveal certain parts of the body or formed certain parts of the body and even as it pertains to wearing uh pants or jeans or garments that pertain to a man say well that's really oldfashioned well just consider it from a very real standpoint how that if you choose to wear a pants that are we say maybe slacks or loose fitting then you're wearing what it would clearly be a garment that pertains to a man and if you wear it too form fitting what does it become draws attention so it's not in the lust of concupisent even as the Gentiles which know not God 1 Thessalonians 4:5 and 6 I don't know if I cued that up not in the lust of concupisent even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified this lust that Paul identifies is this inordinate affection or depraved desire it's emotion or a feeling for something forbidden and Jesus says that if a man looks upon a woman to lust after her he has committed adultery in his heart already and Paul when he's writing says that no man go beyond that means to step over these proper limits to transgress or to trespass and get an advantage we can see then with just these few scriptures I I hope that it there's just enough maybe that suggests this that God has established boundaries for a reason and what Satan would want us to do is to see a boundary and then begin to question God's motive in establishing the boundary we could go back into the Exodus when the children of Israel were told that if they were to eat leaven bread that that person who ate was to be disinherited and put outside of the camp and to be removed from Israel and so God just didn't put up a bunch of signs saying don't eat leaven bread he demanded that all all leaven be removed from the house so this is how God deals with dangers and pitfalls he doesn't say this is the line get as close as you can but he's going to establish a boundary for your own protection and for the protection of others to remove the leaven and there is a line that we could cross when a man lookth upon a woman to lust after her the crossing of a line and the Bible says that we ought not to act in a way that satisfies our lust or our depraved desires that no man go be Beyond and defraud his brother we should be mindful of these boundaries Exodus 20:4 Thou shalt not commit adultery modest apparel is for protection not oppression God looking out after the way that we address the way that we would act and the way that we conduct ourselves and I think it's all encompassing I don't think we should just uh zero in on one thing I think it's a whole character it's a whole life but the standards in God's word are for our protection not oppression when the Bible says Thou shalt not commit adultery it forbids all acts of uncleanness and all desires which produce those acts so it it relates to unnatural lust and things that would be depraved if a man or a woman uh acted that way or acted in a way to satisfy those desires Leviticus 20:3 says if a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an Abomination they shall surely be put on death to death their blood shall be upon them again notice that this is not this is what's Best In The Exodus and this is what's best thousands of years ago and as we've progressed in a society we become more tolerable and these things are okay and God loves everybody and with Christ God's what God hated before through Christ God's now with no there's an amplification of those things which God hates and here if they have committed these things it is an Abomination it is a detestable thing and it says Thou shalt not commit adultery this refers to even unclean thoughts or desires to the Jews this also meant obscene words or impure motions or gestures are you following me to say thou shalt not commit adultery to them was not just you shouldn't sleep with your your best friend's wife a a and to commit adultery as a married person but it says it includes thoughts that are wrong obscene words emotions or gestures that are evil because all these things are unclean and there's acts that we can engage in that satisfi these unnatural desires and these depraved desires whatsoever in itself was unclean or tends to uncleanness they considered adultery whatsoever was unclean or tended to uncleanness they considered adultery I believe this is why certain garments that a woman could wear I think it's one of the reasons why uh uh tight fitting clothes or certain uh necklines or short skirts and even the way that they can be fashioned are all done for the purpose of creating uh attention and getting attention and it's things that can cause a violation of Matthew 5:28 I know the attitude anymore is that well I I should be able to dress however I want present myself however I want and if you augle if you mistreat me if you say something if you do something then that that's a harassment or that's abuse and that's an assault and you should be guilty of it but to me it demonstrates the insanity that someone could dress in a way that discloses their body that suggests themselves and if a man says something or does something in resp response to that provoc provocation then they are the ones that are guilty and before the woman herself would have been guilty as we showed the article here recently that it was against the law for women to wear pants at a certain up to a certain uh timeline it was illegal to wear it until the 1940s why because these things are uh they're disrespecting themselves and others I believe it comes down to that when we are asking ourselves how that we ought to dress we want to do all that we can to preserve our own integrity and be mindful of the Integrity of others in Romans chapter 1 start with verse 23 and on some of these I'm just giving you the uh um the passage I'm going to skip to 23 because so you can turn in your Bibles and maybe make that more of a habit and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to the corruptible man this is ruining the image of God and to birds and four-footed beasts and creep things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dis dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections they have crossed the line that now they're going to dishonor their own bodies between themselves and now God is going to give them over to this for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature there is male and there is female and when we begin to try to break down those distinctions or add many more distinctions to it there's a way that now we are no longer acting according to our nature and women give up their natural use and they change it into what is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is is unseemly improper unfitting and receiving in themselves that recompense of their a which was meat even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient if it's inconvenient it's unfitting it's unseemly does not as the Bible say here does not honor nature it's not proper it's not fitting it's Unbecoming it's shameful and as these scriptures relate to uncleanness or sexual perversion or sexual attraction Jesus says he that looks upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery already with her in his heart shows that the way a woman looks is connected to these other principles in scripture of adultery and Abominations and changing the natural use into something that is unfitting trying to walk through this as delicately as I can I shown you scripturally why these standards exist trusting that you as a Believer would be the one that would identify what pleases the Lord in the way that you dress but these these these the principle of modesty is connected with this danger of adultery there's other principles in scripture and in the message of the hour you'll find that on its face you say I can't find a scripture that says this but then you begin to find other scriptures that speak to the danger of transgressing in that thing be really hard maybe to find uh I can't find any scriptures on uh on cell phones or I can't find any quotes on on uh laptops and so we kind of carve out this little niche of things that we can use but no we find principles that those things violate and that's what causes us to set the proper boundaries in our lives now Genesis 3: 5 and six I want to look at this and I I hope I'm making good enough time here but as we often do we end up back in Genesis to see and and I'm looking at this too there was this original picture that God had painted and it's that picture that Satan marred and here the serpent is talking to the woman about God's requirements God's boundaries for God doth know that the day that you transgress this boundary that in that day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil Now Catch what happens with the woman and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat this verb saw the woman when the woman saw it's this intense inner struggle it's this uh it's an intellectual activity it's not necessarily a craving of the Body for a uh nutrients or hunger for something that would satisfy uh hunger pains this is an intense inner struggle when the woman saw and what she saw wasn't right she looked incorrectly so this process in her mind this wrong meditation in her mind about something forbidden just to begin to entertain it long enough to say well God said no but this entertaining begins to happen and sin we know begins in the mind and the battle is First lost in our thinking so that's where the devil wants to work and so in verse five what Satan does is he paints God as selfish he paints God as controlling and that God has established these parameters solely for his own gain and his own benefit to keep something away from you to be restrictive to to bind you to subjugate you and so if the devil can just begin to cause you to think in your mind that God's requirements are honorous so there are two uh uh uh two binding too oppressive and to question God's Integrity this is ultimately what Satan does is he calls him to question God's integrity and she was led to believe that God was intentionally depriving her of some pleasure or experience that God was doing this selfishly that God was doing this without reason that God was just doing this because he knows that once you do you'll have this experience and your eyes will be open and that God God's integrity was questioned and in doing so it ruined the good in God's creation brother Bram and he's preaching the deity of Jesus Christ says that man lost his original in the Garden of Eden his relationship communion with with God was cut off there because of sin and unbelief unbelief in what the word of God he says a picture was painted one time to Eve it told her how much brighter it would be if she' just discard the word of God look over here to read reason mistrust brought the visic excuse me the visible Act of Disobedience unbelief mistrust produce the visible Act of Disobedience and that's where our clothing our Behavior our words the things that we would gaze upon become visible acts of Disobedience when we don't trust God when we disbelieve God when we don't believe his word and take him at his word then it's there's going to be some visible act listen consider it tremendously that do you believe it's wrong to look at a woman in lust do you believe it's wrong to watch things you shouldn't watch is it wrong to lust then you if you believe it then you better not continue to misbehave in Acts that signify and indicate Disobedience disbelief brother man to dis to disbelieve the word for intellectuals intellects and it ruined the whole creation this is where creation was marred is that when God had a boundary for their protection when God had a way of doing things that Satan could begin to cause her to think in her mind and begin to question God's integrity and losing the battle in her mind it caused her to act visibly in Disobedience to God and that's what ruined the creation brother Brandon's writing in the church age book in the Ephesian Church age he said the Ephesian age had presented to her the opportunity for God's best and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination just as it had happened in the garden where Satan was able to paint a picture to Eve the same thing happens in Ephesus they were doing so good they had an opportunity notice an opportunity for God's best for a while they Prevail but then in that unguarded moment Satan plants the seed of Ruin when mankind responded to his fall Genesis 3:7 the eyes of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons I know I'm reviewing a lot we're just tying a lot of these things together hoping maybe just to close this chapter of this series naked them recognizing their nakedness after sin signified their inner nakedness they had been stripped of something they're now conscious of their guilt and they make here loin cloths to cover their private parts and then when God goes looking after him Adam still admits he's still naked he's not properly clothed and today where we sit today as we can see in the beginning Satan painted a picture to Eve then in the beginning of the church that in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination today the lack of Integrity has resulted in the physical stripping of the body to match the nakedness or the spiritual condition of the people as they are naked spiritually they are now becoming more naked externally Revelations 3:1 17 because thou sayest I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked notice the contrast now to the Garden that when man sinned through that nakedness he experienced in his soul through this the the holy image of God leaving them this light having left them now in the and they're conscious of their nakedness now in the end they're unconscious of their nakedness in other words they're not conscious of guilt there's no they no longer can feel shame when they dress inappropriately Adam and the woman dressed rest in Lain cloths felt naked in the presence of God but now people are so calloused in their senses and they're so numb they're so naked in their minds they cannot feel shame Adam and the woman felt the loss of their integrity they felt the this they felt the ruin of their innocence they could feel light lifting from them this disappearance of light but Romans tells us Romans chapter 1 that people are given over to vile affections and they can do things with justification and feel no shame Paul writes to Timothy 1 Timothy 4: 1 and 2 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in a latter time some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron why are people living acting and dressing and presenting themselves the way they do today they're blind and don't know it they're naked and don't there's no sense of Shame anymore there's no blush it is as brother brandham rightfully called it out decades ago Insanity to the point we mentioned it here recently that certain things that were Bonafide diagnosable uh mental disorders they just say no uhuh that's a lifestyle no uhuh this is okay there's no end to it then there's absolutely no barometer no litmus test no diagnosis you oh that's the way they want to be that's the way they want to be where does it all end up it's Insanity so God has the prescription God has the answer Revelations 3:18 I counsel to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with is have that thou mayest see that there could be this consciousness of guilt so that you could have eyes open white linen this beautiful garment to clothe you that you would not be naked gold tried in the fire so many things that we could look into in Greater details we have in the past but it mirrors God in Genesis 3:21 unto Adam and also his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them the bride in the end is AR raay and beautiful garments God has a provided way for us to be clothed in humility and modesty Wednesday night we were looking at the so many scriptures that use the example of how clothing and garments do what they do what they accomplish and those of you are here Wednesday night uh if you agree and if you're member you can say amen and it can kind of encourage the other people say oh okay that's what he talked about all right but on Wednesday night we were showing over and over again a spiritual type using clothing you wear as a spiritual type of how we are spiritually with this putting on this and putting on that and putting on these things and get dressed in this and we made this very simple point that if God is going to use the example of the kinds of clothes that you wear to signify the spiritual character of Christ would he not can be concerned with your actual literal clothing and the answer is absolutely yes because the Bible refers to the same and just as there ought to be modesty in spirit there should be modesty in dress just as there ought to be bowels of kindness and and you dress and you put on the new man who's renewed a certain way then there ought to be a way that we dress as Christians that at least give the opportunity for God's light to be broadcast to others that they can see modesty and Holiness in a very dark time I want you to think about this scripture just a little bit differently and this is where I'm wanting to look at maybe this thought of Integrity being restored this wholeness this Purity Isaiah 60:2 for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth engross Darkness the people it's a covering it's clothing darkness is going to cover the Earth gross darkness is now what covers people they have not put on the armor of light they're not putting on modesty they're not dressing in a way that would please God and show respect to mankind the Earth is dressed in in perversion but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee that would be my prayer Lord I want to even in the way that not just what I say and what I do but even Lord in a way as a man if there's a way that I can dress so that your glory can be seen I want to do that Lord I hope you all have an appetite by the time I'm done I'm realizing kind of maybe my wisdom de I'm just a young Pastor I'm new at this I don't know that on a on a potluck day you should preach things that make people hungry I'm going home I'm to my stomach this is the good stuff though Revelations chap 19: 7 and 8 there will be a people in which they are modestly restored the Integrity is observed the the the church world is produced behold the monkey right that's what they produced it's incongruent with God's original intent the original Integrity of the picture that God painted in the beginning that Satan ruined they think they've restored it but what have they produced Satan's kingdom Satan's Eden but there will be a bride who has Integrity there will be a people who are restored the Bible says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready she is going to be the only one in the appropriate wedding gown the rest can dress however they want but there'll be one who dresses herself in the word of God and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine L is the righteousness of the Saints his as gross Darkness dresses the people God's glory is going to dress his bride and this is for the marriage the marriage takes place now and as this marriage is taking place we're engaged in a spiritual Feast we read from Matthew chap 22: 11 and 12 and this King had a Feast this wedding Feast when the king came near to see the guest he saw there was a man which had not on a wedding garment and it caught the king's attention he said why do you not have on a wedding garment the Bible says and the one who came without the wedding garment says he was speechless this may seem uh unfair really really strict but not wearing the wedding garment he's not fit for the wedding Feast when the Bible says he's speechless he knew the dress code when he what's being said here when it's speechless it means he knew better it implies he had been granted the opportunity to prepare and he refused it the Bible says and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints this age is not does not have an excuse we do not have an excuse to say well this is just the way that everyone else was doing this is just the way that I thought it was supposed to be this this that and the other he had been granted the opportunity to dress in the wedding garment but refused it the wedding Feast is only for those who accept the wedding garment it's only he that wears the wedding garment who will be at home in the wedding Feast we saw in Exodus 12 how that the Passover feast required us specific dress code the wedding the wedding supper requires wedding garments the time that we're living in now I could just go on a whole another Trail we are now feasting with the King we are citizens of another kingdom the Bible says he's prepared a table for us in the presence of our enemies he's anointed our heads with oil our cups runneth over if we are feasting at the T with our King if we are now in his presence feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man then we we must be dressed for the occasion and I'd like to go down this positive path in the end maybe give you just uh a it's a just a general guideline you say well if I if I dress must dress modestly if I I want the glory of the Lord to be seen on me then by what standard should we be judging ourselves there may be a point at which we could all agree that those heels are too high and maybe we could do that as Christians we might even do that just as uh decent human beings that think well that's just we just have common sense ask a podiatrist those things are not healthy it it it's caused more chronic health issues in women H and that's substantiated over and over again over decades and decades just using common sense if we're all into Wellness all these Wellness INF influencers get rid of the hills babe right how do you have to talk you know how's the way that they do it now when they're all close to the camera and there's like this influencer hand signal they use I need to figure it out so I could talk in away and we could do these little short clips on our YouTube page where I'm looking up at the camera these are common there's a lot of things that could be just common sense that that's gone so how is it we could dress today how we can standard uh what standard could we elicit for our own lives we could ask ourselves what what is uh immodest or what's become what's ruined what Mars the image of God what what it has integrity and as we looked at Daniel chapter 3 we read the story of hananiah as AAR and mishael those are their given Hebrew names Shadrach mesach and Abednego are their caldan names that they were given but as an image was erected of Daniel and they were a commandment was given and I think we can also assume that from the scripture that the image was of Daniel because Daniel would not have bowed to another image but he would not have been required to worship an image of himself and so unless you believe that Daniel bowed and Jack Daniel chapter 3 you have to conclude that it was probably an image of Daniel therefore he's not required to do so and these Hebrew children knowing better at the sound of all those things that are mentioned to worship this golden image with the which the King Nebuchadnezzar had set up they refused to do so and then in refusing to do so they're threatened and they felt this coercion to bow to the idol there was the pressure of the people then there was the pressure of the king himself and it was look you're not going to do this everyone else is doing it th this is what you ought to do this is what is expected of you this is if you don't there's a price to be paid and sure enough they give that those great this great pronouncement our God is able to save us from the fiery furnace and then I love it but even if he doesn't we still won't bow the Bible says in Daniel 3: 211 then these men were bound found and notice it says in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments all right why are they telling us how they're dressed before they go into the fiery furnace well I want you to know that they were wearing coats hos and hats and other garments and they're cast in the midst of the burning fiery furnace it's interesting that they describe them before they're thrown into this fire and it describes a very unique dress that would have been appropriate for their service to the king in the gates these rulers that God that the king had set up and they would have looked very caldan they wouldn't have necessarily looked like a a Jew but in wearing their hats and their holes and their garments and these turbin and the other ways these wide long pants is the way it's described and they would have a a wool shirt and this outer mantle they would have a girdle and a turban that's these things that were being described they would look Babylonian they would look caldian so In This Moment that they're being pressured by all intents and purposes they might look like anybody else but they chose to do something different than everyone else and I use this example to say that we will look human we will act human we will dress human but we must maintain our integrity we must do so we must be honoring as we ministered on dress codes we must be honoring God's dress code for men and for women brother Brandon when he's preaching there in the summer of 64 he tells the of the preview of the Bride that he had in that Supernatural realm and he saw the Bride come by and she was dressed all beautifully and these white garments and long hair and and Onward Christian Soldiers just a beautifully pristine bride and then there was a secession of of groups that came forward and you can see they're coming out of each Church age they said he finally comes to the the last one which was America and she he said just had a little rag hanging down she was dancing to the beat of rock and roll and then brother Bram and his says oh no is this what my Ministries produces the bride will come in preview again and he says and that little bride this is from Feast of the trumpets each one of them dressed like the nation they come from just perfectly walking before the Lord there is a way that we will and how we dress May maintain some identity with the world there's even a way that you may dress that will maintain some identity of the country you're from or your cultural background or your ethnicity but there's still a way that you can perfectly walk before the Lord when you look at America Le to see her dress code was obviously nakedness no modesty no shame and as these hananiah Azariah and mishia were cast into the fiery furnace they looked like everybody else in Babylon that day but once they were in in verse 25 he said he answered and said Lo they looked in they said the men are not consumed he says I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt in the form of the forth is like the Son of God Is there a way that we can walk with Integrity so that people when they see us can see the form of Christ that if the whole world is dressed in darkness can we be bathed in light and the glory of the Lord clothe us and there they were in this furnace heated seven times hotter than it had ever been heated before and God comes down in the flame with them and I think they in verse 27 they leave out the sheriffs I don't know why but it says in the princes Governors and captains and the King's counselors being gathered together saw these men what happens they're called forth from the flame he called them forth and they came forth the Bible says out of the midst of the fire and now everyone could witness upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed think of this and this this application we can have today neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them this is quite a standard but they went into the fire and God was with them and because God was with them there wasn't even a hint of the fire this is the way that we ought to challenge ourselves to walk through this world to where there's there's no scent of the world the the the fire has no power on us the hair of our head is not SED our Cults are not changed and there's not even the smell of the world on us what had they maintained to the through the fire their integrity the Integrity of their bodies the Integrity of their hair the Integrity of their coats the Integrity of their garments there was not even the smell of the fire on them the fire could not ruin them and I would pray that for us we could maintain our integrity in this end time that the standard we would like to have though it may seem to be General and it might seem to be elusive Lord I don't even want I don't want to smell like the world I don't want a stain of the world I don't want even The Fringe of my garment to be burnt by the world what had happened and they went into that fire is the Integrity of their garments once they come out match the Integrity of their faith it was unspotted uncompromised God preserved body hair coats all of it from the effects of the fire and I believe the Bible goes to links to tell us what they were wearing and their pants and their uh wool shirt their outer mantle their girdle and their turban to say that all these clothes were not only not burnt but you couldn't even smell the fire on them and I believe this is our challenge today maintaining our integrity so that even our outer garments match the Integrity of our faith the Bible says in Jude 23 and others Sav with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh spotted it means that it's a loss of Integrity to be defiled to be blemished stained spoiled something to be detested or despised garments here and in and in the scripture we saw they can be used as a metaphor for actions and behavior but it also applies to our literal physical appearance as the Hebrew children survived a furnace that had been heated seven times hotter than it ever been heated before our dress should not be contaminated by lust and pride the way that we present ourselves as women the way that we dress as men the way that we act should not be influenced by lust and pride brother BR said one spot of Leaven ruins the lump one word of God displaced spoils the whole picture if we're being restored we want to know the original original Integrity we're not being restored to do cosplay of the Believers in the upper room we're not being restored to try to reenact what happened in the book of Acts we're being restored with this original Integrity that what God what what God looks like today what he does today because he's the same yesterday today and forever and this is interesting others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire we save with fear there's this caution that we use and it's saying that our lives must be close enough to the fire to pull people out but we have to be fearful enough to not be touched by it it SS it's it's not going to work we said brother Aon after these several Services we just pulled all our money together and we've got a billion dollars let's just move in the middle of nowhere in Utah or Wyoming we've got enough to live off of we we've got all sorts of mem coins that are making us money right now and and let's just get away from the world and we've bought uniforms and everyone will look this way and men will wear this and women will wear that but okay but that's not going to work because the Bible says we're in this world but not of this world that we ought to have the love of God in our hearts that's willing to willing to be human enough to save other humans but Divine enough to be unspotted by the world am others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire no you're close enough to save them from the flame but you give great care so that your life's not ruined by it your garments aren't you hate even the Garment that would be spotted by the flesh you take great care Jude is advocating for care and caution of avoiding worldliness and the influence of the flesh but being close enough to save the those who are being ruined by it because the Bible says that Christ wants to present to himself a glorious Church Ephesians 5:27 Brothers you can come to your instruments not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish that it should be holy and with Integrity not being ruined not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing it's maintained its Integrity it's been restored back to its original Integrity I'll just quickly reference it but the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 that we desire to be clothed with a house from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked nakedness is not the goal going back to some sort of a original Garden of Eden to where we don't care if people are naked there's this idea even within uh intellectual crowds that the stigma of the naked body is something that has been conjured up by the Christian church or Islam or or Christianity and Judaism has caused the shame and so if you go to different places and maybe in some region of the world where there hasn't been contact with Christianity or these other religions that tribes and people can exhibit this lack of Shame for their naked bodies and they use that as an argument that it's it's Christians it's Muslims it's Jews that have ruined it but God in the very beginning wasn't intending that we just become accepting accepting of the the body but he desired that we be clothed and he says that not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon and he says that mortality might be swallowed up of life that would be my prayer is Lord I I I I want this body to change one day so this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality and when this corruptible shall have put on it's the language of dress it's the language ofo clothing put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality what we changing robes then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory I I I want to have victory in my character I want to have victory in my life victory in my home this relates to how we dress I say this with great uh a great burden in my heart for our young people to all of us that these things we may not preach a lot about it in this church but we can't just assume that we all know but there is a standard of the word of God there a standard of modesty in how our ladies should dress we get consider ation to not cutting our hair to the the garments we wear whether it be a dress or a skirt we we consider even the shoes that we wear and we ask ourselves is this pleasing to the Lord is this does this honor the Lord is this respectful of myself and respectful of others brother bramman choosing of a bride he says it this way and I I just want to Echo the sentiment of being unspotted from the world though we may have coats and hosen and hats and other garments and though the the things we read in Isaiah we might have some similar things with hairstyles and and things that we could wear brother BR says and coming up on this side came the same bride that went around this way and here come them little ladies again he says and each one of them was dressed in their National Guard from where they come from now what could that be I know brother Tim do had a very beautiful uh use of that he said that that each one it was a the bride being dressed in the word this is how it struck him I think he even ministered on it here how that the bride around the world are going to have the message in their own language and the word is dressing them beautiful type but brother bam identified them as coming from Switzerland Germany and so forth each one wearing that kind of Garb all long hair how did he know what nation they were from the way they dressed but he said they all have long hair just exactly like the one of at the first and here they come walking with the same song Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war didn't matter their nationality didn't matter what their ethnicity was didn't matter what region of the country they were from they still found a way to dress that would may have been true to their Nation their nationality but true to Christ so he could see them and he could comment say oh my look at each one of them [Music] dressed so perfectly walking before the Lord God help us to maintain our [Music] integrity let's stand to our feet let's pray together thank you for your patience today gracious Heavenly Father Lord as if we had had an opportunity to go through these words today we considered a a wonderful privilege Lord but there's a always seems to be great caution for myself Lord I tread these things very delicately I'm I'm I'm very much aware Lord how that we could take the Bible and misuse it very much aware of the wounds and scars that it can cause if we don't speak the truth in love Lord we ought not to just speak these things as truth but take the truth of the word of God that says how a man should act even how a woman should dress and speak it in love Lord my prayer would not that we could come up with a satisfactory dress code as a church but that each individual believer male or female would consider how they can please you dress and act in a way that pleases you because we know Lord that if we can honor you in what we say and do that your word likewise in turn leads us to honor ourselves our bodies and [Music] others Lord as men we should never act in a way that would make somebody uncomfortable Lord we would never want as a lady to dress in a way that would make somebody uncomfortable and I know Lord is many conversations have been had on this subject that there's always some crazy out there who could be mesmerized with all sorts of things and there could be inappropriate ways that these things are handled but Lord we only know to do what's right for ourselves help us Lord to do those things which are right in your sight as one day we will take off this old robe and put on a new one an IM mortal body Lord may we continue every day to strive to take off corruption and put on incorruption Lord may we be human enough to rescue people from fires but Divine enough to keep unspotted from the world and Lord just as the devil was successful in causing your integrity to be questioned in the beginning and the woman lost the battle in the mind may this bride in this end time may we as individual members of that body not question your integrity but honor your boundaries and these landmarks and hold to them with great purpose as you show us the reason behind it the wisdom behind it Lord that day in the garden their eyes were open but not in a way that they thought would be opened with the of their nakedness they rushed quickly to clothe themselves but still felt naked we've arrived at a place in the end time lord where people are physically naked now they don't care they don't even consider it naked Lord to think that a woman could argue that their swimwear is different than their underwear on the basis of consent shows how insane we've [Music] become Lord may we no longer give consent for the world to augle us may we no longer give consent to the devil to cause us to question your standards but Lord may we dress in a way that respect you respects ourselves and respects others and Lord I know that there's very specific things we could say things that we could quote and instances we could give but Lord I want to I want it to be clear in your word what your standard is your Bible teaches these things we want to honor them we love you Lord and we ask all these things name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord
