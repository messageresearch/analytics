TRANSCRIPT
========================================
proverbs chapter 24 verses 3 and 4. welcome everyone to the house the lord today we're very very glad that you could be here we'll begin reading again proverbs chapter 24 verses 3 and 4. through wisdom is a house builded and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches you may be seated i really love these verses it's a wonderful promise just to kind of put your finger on and say this is this i believe that through wisdom is a house built and by understanding it's established and made firm and by knowledge that's how you fill all the rooms with precious and pleasant riches by wisdom and knowledge and understanding we're continuing on the subject of revelation resolves complication and i want to remind you that kind of the trajectory of how we found ourselves even in this area to begin to talk about how now life is complicated we're looking at how uh at the end of the beginning now it's complicated because after the fall the simplicity of the life that existed in the garden has been lost and uh and we were using this kind of as a foundation or an entry an entrance into the subject of family and and relationships and just life so that we're not um filtering the word the wrong way or looking at things with the wrong perspective because we need to acknowledge number one the age that we live in the time that we're living in the circumstances that we all face and not make the mistake of kind of splicing things together in our minds and using certain filters to even create a picture that's not accurate about the world we're living in or merely just try to present our lives in a way that other people think everything's okay but be very honest about our lives the situations we're facing and taking that kind of honest approach to what we're going through no matter what we meet and what we face we believe the word is enough and we believe that this is the reality of what i'm going through my marriage or my my children or my financial situation or my health say this is the reality but the word is enough and just to anchor in that so we we haven't kind of uh we haven't moved on beh beyond that whole idea how that god is wanting to be manifested in family and how that our families are called to be a portrait of god but i i just was directed in this area to acknowledge and point out that we live in complicated times and if we try to use a complicated mind to make sense of it all it's only going to get worse and last sunday we were examining how all of humanity had lost focus of the one thing needful and how they had lost their faith in god they were no longer believing in his promise because man and the woman even as they were thrust out of the garden they would have been looking to the promise of genesis 3 15 and believing that even though they were in sin and even though they had made a horrible mistake god told them before they left i'll take care of this i'll make a way i'll redeem you out of this so they still had a promise to live for and abel caught a revelation and offered his sacrifice through that revelation and by faith and that was acceptable to god and pleasing to god and we're bringing it to revelations chapter 3 verse 17 to look at the time that we're living in and we explored the scripture in greater detail on wednesday and i realize these scriptures have been used quite a bit already even this year but in revelations chapter 3 verse 17 this is the confession of the world today society at large that i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing this is the profession this is the even the thought process uh whether it's uh consciously uh expressed or meditated upon this is really what's at the heart of laodiceans is they say i'm rich increased with goods and have need of nothing but god says because you think that way and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked because you think that way i have a prescription for you and we were brother brennan made a comment when he was writing the church age book that a great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in so we want to be aware that there's this burden that we're all facing this pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions and and you say oh i don't i don't have a problem with the pressure of riches and i don't have a problem with soft living and i don't have a promise a problem with nervous tensions and uh you might find that all of a sudden you start getting a little bit too hot in church today or too cold you find the seats not exactly comfortable that's soft living right i mean let's just be honest about it you're like i just wish we could get different chairs can we bring our own lawn chairs to uh to church and that that's that's the whole idea of soft living is there certain things we've gotten accustomed to there's things that we can't live without and so these things exist and not just on them on their own but in a complex age in an age where god is doing a lot of a lot of supernatural powerful things and satan thinks he's finally hit his stride and figured everything out and so it's a very complex age that we're living in and what mankind lacks is they think they're rich increased with goods and have need of nothing but in reality they're poor wretched miserable and blind and naked and they lack the knowledge and i've been using this phrase because jesus told martha there's only one thing one thing necessary there's only one thing needful that good part and so they lack the knowledge of what is best in what is needful and lacking that knowledge and lacking an adherence to that they give themselves over to the flesh and to knowledge and science and sinning and we've been using the phrase that one of the philosophers used the cause of sinning is ignorance of what is better and so the very profound statement uh that they attribute to democrities he says the reason why man makes mistakes the reason why man sins the reason why man offends and does things that's displeasing to god and harmful to humanity is because they don't know what is better assuming that there should be some at least base nature within man that if they knew what the right thing was they would at least try to do it but with ignorance of what is better they give themselves over to even ultimately what is the worst and we're looking at this contrast of ignorance of what is better versus revelation because revelation conquers ignorance revelation is the answer to a lack of knowledge revelation is the answer to a lack of understanding and the bible even says my people have sinned they've fallen apart because of a lack of knowledge and so knowledge of the divine knowledge of the will of god is kind of the the protection and the power to overcome um the sin of ignorance and the sins and the weaknesses that come because you've forgotten what is needful and today we're gonna lord we'll inventure into it not venture but lead into an area that is very practical so if you could just even right now just be very focused and say lord i i've had prayers i've been very specific to you lately i've been asking god to deal with my heart and you have questions and you've been putting them before the lord if you can get very focused right now i believe god's going to answer a prayer and i believe it can be very very practical now in genesis chapter 4 verse 7 god had approached cain after he had accepted abel's offering and he tells cain if thou doest well if you do that which is pleasing to me you will also be accepted if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door if you know there's a better way even if you don't know specifically what that is and you choose not to find it out and to walk in it sin will always be in your conscience because if you because knowing that you're not doing what is best and knowing that you're not doing what is right then you're condemned by your own sin your uh whatsoever is not of faith is sin is another scripture that we use that if you don't have absolute confidence that what you're doing is pleasing to the lord then you're going to have this part of your conscience that begins to condemn you that you may be wrong how do you know you're not how you know you're not making a mistake and this is this dynamic that god is identifying within the mindset of man here right in genesis chapter four god has already given us insight into how the human mind works he says if i'm telling you right now if you do well if you do what's pleasing to me i'll accept you just as i did abel but if you don't it's going to bother you it's going to eat at you it's going to really work you over and cain actually lives a life proving that sin was driving him and this consciousness of his guilt was driving because he leaves off from where they were and he runs from the presence of the lord and he begins to build civilization he builds a city a walled city to always be on watch why he was afraid his sin would come back to get him and this dominated mankind and here in the scripture god gives cain an opportunity to ask for what was better if you do what's pleasing will you not be accepted then cain could have said well then lord what's pleasing what is it about my brother's sacrifice that pleased you and so he would have given him an opportunity for that way that was most excellent or more excellent so this was god's counsel to cain even in the midst of his ignorance and this is such grace that he would approach him so that's grace that he would approach cain knowing cain the product of sin and cain the product of this great fall in this uh hybridian process god still goes to him says there's a better way and if you do the better way you'll be accepted and this was god's counsel so in revelations chapter 3 verse 18 this is god's counsel because you say i'm rich increased with goods and have need of nothing and you don't realize that you're wretched miserable poor blind and naked i counsel thee so this is god's counsel to the laodicean conscience and condition i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire brother branham makes the statement in the church age book and this is a very beautiful teaching the gold of god is christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction so when god says i counsel thee to buy of me gold trying the fire he's actually presenting a different type of transaction to the church than what they're engaging in because they believe they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing they've gotten to that place through commerce they've gotten through to that place of of buying and acquiring in a certain exchange so now he's presenting to them a different type of exchange i counsel thee to buy of me buy from me gold tried in the fire in that gold is the christ-like character produced through affliction now we we don't even want that for free let alone buying it but it it it's introducing to us a different value system that we ought to value character more than we do the things that we possess that we ought to do we ought to value christ like character even if it can only be achieved through suffering that at the end of the day that's what i really desire to have is have christ-like character if i'm destitute of everything else but can stand in the character of christ or then i've gained it all and so it becomes a different value system and what we're touching on now i'll use it in this in this context just to so you kind of open up the door wider to what i'm looking at and pondering that as believers we have things that we assess greater value to than what the world does and so we could be evaluating an opportunity and we would have a balance sheet and we would have certain entries into that balance sheet and we would come up with a a weight at the end and say this is how much value this opportunity has and then you compare it to another opportunity and the world would say well what's the retirement what's the health insurance what's the opportunity for upward mobility and in in raises and you'd have all these different things that you'd be looking at and how much is my salary going to be and uh is there a bonus for signing on and all these things may add up towards like this this entire contract offered to me is worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars uh in the first year and then you have this other opportunity over here and you line up all the same things but then you have another balance sheet that you begin to evaluate the rest of them of i and quality of life am i able to spend time with my family am i able to be of assistance to the body of christ am i able to attend church am i going to be able to put the lord first and all of a sudden you find that there's other entries that ought to be evaluated and many times it's the job that's tens of thousands of dollars less in terms of dollars that's a more valuable opportunity than the one that has a higher salary because you have a different uh you have a different value system you have a different way of evaluating a transaction or an exchange and so he says i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed brother adam said there's a price to pay for those garments and that is the price of separation wow that's a that's a very heavy statement there's a price to pay for those garments and it's a price of separation he says that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear so that's the reason why these garments are necessary that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear you'll find that each one of these is answering the gold tried in the fire is answering to the richness the the clothing answers to the nakedness and and being increased with goods and each one of these things it answers to the confession and the reality god has given this beautiful prescription and he says and anoint that eyes with i said that thou mayest see and brother brahman said there's no he does not say that you have to buy the isaf he says buy me gold tried the fire so there is not anything necessary this affliction and this suffering where you're giving yourself to something and you're having to pay this price of separation and pay this price of affliction to achieve the gold or to achieve the white gold but he says there's no price for the i salve he says there's no price tag on the holy spirit now what is it directly connected to the spiritual revelation of the word that is something that is available that god wants to give you if something says just take and anoint thine eyes with isaf what does it take it takes a genuine experience of the new birth for someone to have this holy spirit that can open your eyes and we know it continually opens our eyes the new birth is a revelation of jesus christ personally to me but when i receive when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost and you're born again in christ then you you're as a newborn babe and you're beginning to develop spiritual characteristics and abilities and that can only be done through the nurture of the spirit and by taking the sincere milk of the word of god and growing to where you can handle meat and what happens your sense is the situation the only way she can get out of revelations 3 17 he says is by obeying the lord to come back to his word this is what's expressed in verse 18 the only way you can get out of and not be entangled in in subject to and overwhelmed by the laodicean condition is to obey the lord and come back to his word it's by our knowledge of and our adherence to the pure word that is what is going to be our health and that's what's our that's going to be our wealth it's a very simple statement to realize this that no no believer is any more healthy any more spiritual and any more alive than his knowledge of and his obedience to the pure word of god so your health your spiritual health your your spiritual wealth and if we i would even want to express it this way true health and true wealth even as it would relate to the physical is not going to be any greater than your understanding of the word of god and then your obedience and adherence to the word of god because what would a perfect health be with no sickness at all if you're running further away from god and sinning and piling yourself up complexes and circumstances and poor decisions you say what is it all going to get you in the end nothing that lasts and so our knowledge of and obedience to the word of god is our health it is our wealth brother bennett makes this statement and if you want to if you wanted to kind of read all these things together this is just out of the church age book and even god's diagnosis in chapter 9 there the the church age book and brother i'm referring to verse 18 the council of god is terse it's to the point and this is just as we're using this as god gave counsel in the garden as god gave counsel to cain as god has often given his counsel in the word of god now this is counsel to us it's terse it's to the point he directs this last day church to one hope the hope is himself his directness to one hope the hope is himself there's no other there's no other what can help christ what's my hope christ he says come to me and buy yes you're not going to find it in a man you're not going to find him in a particular church he's got to come to him he said well brother aaron do not want people to come to church absolutely i want you to come to church do you want them to come to your church if god would lead them come here but what i would hope that they would ultimately experience is not an interaction with me but an exchange with god something that takes place between man and god where they come to him and they bind that you're not coming here for an exchange of ideas and personalities and politics and pretense and and opportunities to hear certain gifts express themselves through music and through word and we're not just here for the fellowship that follows though we enjoy that but we come because this is a dynamic where i know i can come to god and i can get the things that i need and that are necessary and it's just an extension of that dynamic that should play out in our lives every day wouldn't it be awful the only time we prayed is when we came to church yeah i i i want to say this in a way if that was the case we would probably enjoy we would have a church experience that we would enjoy a lot in the flesh because it would just be one big huge guilt session right we all just want to feel better about ourselves i'm a really horrible christian six days a week but then i could come i could come to church and i just and the worship is great and the music is hyped and the pastor comes out and just gets us all really excited about what we believe and and being being being christ-like and jesus in the world today and then we can just kind of go back and live and forget all about uh really what life is all about so coming here is not just an opportunity to placate guilt but it's it's a further extension of what should be taking place in our lives every other day of the week so he says come to me and by it is evident from this phrase by of me that the laodicean church is not at all dealing with jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of god this is a a a a very telling statement he says that the very fact that jesus speaks and god is saying to i counsel it to buy of me the fact that he's having to tell them to come to him to get something exposes the fact that they are not dealing with him with all their spiritual attainments that they're not dealing with him to have their richness their increase to increase of goods and their lack of need of anything that they haven't actually exchanged with god to have these things but has been entirely carnal and of their own pursuits and their own living this phrase is evidence that they have not been going to christ for a transaction or exchange for the spiritual products of the kingdom of god they've actually left christ and the words out to build whatever kingdom they're building and they've built like you can build pretty awesome kingdoms and you can build a very uh you know thriving kingdoms and systems and that don't lack for membership and that don't lack for a good works and don't lack for resources and finances but this is exposing a particular mindset to where man judges his spirituality by materiality and p and we have this instinct and and i want to be very very blunt don't be quick to say not me because we'll we can judge a church very quickly and go oh oh that that that church and you're judging just by the appearance of the building ah it's kind of a ratty building it's in a bad side of town you know they meet in a strip shopping center and there's just a dollar general where the anchors there and and you start making assumptions about the church and you're just using it carnally and i know this is true there's been times that a minister is asked to preach and you know there's a busy minister you don't know who he is and he comes out to preach and he's kind of dressed in like that that suit that suit was popular in the 80s right the 80s just paged me on my beeper they want their suit back right and immediately you're like i don't know where this is going and you get uncomfortable why because you've used carnal metrics to judge something through the the materiality and you begin to judge right away whether or not you're gonna get anything out of the service all based upon material things you're judging a church's spirituality because of their zip code because they rent or or whatever it might be and you're using carnal things to to make a spiritual judgment and we've got to be very careful that we don't do that they've been using their carnality for the spiritual products and using the material wealth and their increase of goods to say hey we must be doing good i mean we can't be all bad if we've got this these things going for us but he says this their transactions cannot be spiritual their transactions cannot be spiritual this is a prophet taking the diagnosis from god in revelations 3 18 and saying what god is saying here when he wrote out this prescription anybody here brother branham as a prophet as a pharmacist could look at this prescription and say oh if he's prescribing that then this must be what's wrong and that's what someone who brother branham is able to do say god would have never said come to me and buy if they had spiritual transactions and if they were already interacting with god but he's had to say hey hey over here come over here stop being so carnal you got to come over here to get what you need to be spiritual their transactions cannot be spiritual whatever they're carnal and so this is a challenge for us in light of this prescription i counsel thee to come to buy of me and it and this is god presenting this to the laodicean church we also challenge ourselves and i believe that we ought to right now begin to audit our transactions by the word go ahead and begin to do an audit i'm going to take inventory of my life i'm going to kind of run through my transactions my point my point of sales everything i'm exchanging what i'm giving what i'm receiving what i'm pursuing what i'm buying what i'm consuming and i want to go ahead and look at my life and ask myself and what i'm seeing take place in terms of spiritual products am i is the kingdom of god being established in my life through transactions that are spiritual or do i find that i'm actually building a pretty good natural kingdom that if i that maybe one day i'd be able to hand over to my children and and i would have my estate planned and i would have this trust set up and i would have this retirement account and had everything established to where if i ever if when i die the the state will be distributed this way and that my products of what i'm transacting in and the exchanges that i'm doing are merely building a natural kingdom that would be passed down to my children or do am i building a spiritual kingdom of god that the bible says this good man and a righteous man leaves an inheritance for his grandchildren now what kind of what kind of inheritance would that be it's it's not just merely pointing to a 401k or a retirement plan or an investment account or even real estate that's going to survive economies changing and falling that your grandchildren can benefit from it but actually a kind of character and an integrity and a life lived before the lord that not only impacts your son but will impact your grandson that these are things of value and these are things that you begin to think about and begin to ponder and so we want to kind of give think about our lives he says their transactions are not spiritual a transaction is a negotiated agreement it's a management or settlement or the settlement of an affair reaching to a conclusion or an exchange it comes from the the combination of a word across beyond or through and to set into motion or to drive forward transaction to come across and to drive forward so it means to accomplish it means to perform it means to drive or carry through to come to an agreement so brave says their transactions cannot be spiritual their drive and their motivation what's carrying them over what's bringing them through is not spiritual and as he said that the gift gold to god is christ-like character in the and the garments of separation uh is this white raiment and he uses those that language to get us to ponder what god is presenting they do not value character it's not tech integrity that they're valued it's not being pleasing to the lord it's not a satisfied conscience between the man and god that they want to pursue but rather they're pursuing consumption and and their own profession in god's diagnosis they kind of they harmonize and match because they've got a lot of stuff but god is saying you valued the wrong things they're not valuing character but rather they're seeking to consume and so the spirit of the age and this is as i look to a couple words that i want to define to you this is kind of where things begin to turn a little bit more focused and get a little bit more focused in the spirit of the age blinds us from true contentment it really blinds us from what really satisfies and i'll say this confidently about the elect that there's only ever going to be one thing that completely satisfies and that's christ and you can spend your entire life pursuing things and it's never going to scratch that itch until you come to christ wealth won't do it health won't do it jobs popularity money women all of it it'll never satisfy until you come to christ the bible says that as many as um believed as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and that word ordained is actually translated in one place and has the meaning in the greek as many as we're addicted to eternal life believed and with the elect it's just it's really the truth you were born with an addiction you were born as a word junkie and you just didn't know it it was put in there by your heavenly father and you were born needing the word to fix you just as a a a drug junkie needs a fix they need to get a fix so you needed to fix and there was only one person that could satisfy it and it was the word why because i was born addicted to the word and that's why nothing satisfies i mean even even as you begin to look back in your life in elementary school and middle school in high school when you're hanging out with all the skaters and they're all they're loving thrashing and you're liking it too but yet it doesn't do for you what it's doing for them and you're like this isn't working so i'm going to go hang out with the ropers and you start riding cows and wearing boots and like maybe this is where i'll find it and yeah you kind of enjoy riding bulls a little bit but it still doesn't really anchor deep inside your heart and you just pursue all this stuff but then one day you meet him you're like this is what i needed when i was 14. where was this my whole life you were addicted to it and so there's something there's a way that this world has been constructed to blind us to what truly will satisfy the believer and blind us from true contentment for the sake of consuming content consuming things and i want to present this contrast to you today of being content which is desiring no more than what one has to be satisfied to be content to have a peace of mind to be content willing to accept something that is granted something that you receive you're happy with it you're satisfied with it and so there's this it's an adverb to be content it's something that's modifying your state or content which is information or proportion of a substance something contained it's something uh it's certain items or something material are you content or do you want content there's a contentment that god wants to give you and there's a content that this world wants to give you are you content or do you want content you want possessions you want material wealth you want substance you want information and we should be content and not content consumers what defines us what motivates us what we begin we want to find is that peace and that satisfaction and we live in an age of content not a content age it's a complex age not an age that is satisfying we're not living in the age that is placated or status or satisfied rather but an age of content a content production content consumption even doing it now to where things are completely immeasurable in you can't take inventory of it with even some of the it's some unique accounting problems with public companies or companies that need to have their financials audited and i know i'm venturing into an area that i'm going to really make a fool out of myself by trying to talk about accounting and math i can only count by 500. it's very it can be very hard to figure out how do you how do you qualify quantify an asset when it's digital and you can just produce it without end and people are willing to pay for it so you can have a a particular purchase within an app and it'd say well you can buy this this gem within this app and you can buy it for ten thousand dollars and then we have a we have 10 million of them available in the app store and you want to put that on your balance sheet in your financials isn't that a crazy idea to think it's like enron's figured it out and worked its way into the digital world and you can create value where there isn't even anything there and it's it's all part of this wild world we're living in where there's it's an age of content content consumption content production and things that have value and things that are pursued and things that increase the wealth and the in the economy and things can be done that are completely without occupying any space physically but have more value than even real estate and it's all driven it's all driving the experience to experience things and that's how we look at this template of how satan attempted eve by knowledge in order to experience something and we're all being tempted to have these experiences and so this mindset of laodicea is this insatiable appetite this craving for goods for entertainment for pleasure for wealth i want to acquire one accumulate i want to have i want to have i want to have and when we ended sunday morning last week in ephesians chapter 4 we very quickly went over this scripture and i want to read it again this i say therefore and testify in the lord that you henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind so jesus identified in matthew chapter 6 that the gentiles seek after what they're going to eat what they'll drink and what they're going to wear that's all that a gentile is worried about is the roof over his head the bed he sleeps in the clothes he wears and the food he eats and what does that contrast to the gentiles were those who were not jews it's all other nations and them not being jews they're not looking to a real promise they can invent all sorts of gods and ideologies and belief systems but there's this distinction between jews and gentiles because jews were people of promise the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob what made them who they were this god revealed himself to them and gave them a promise so the children of israel are people of promise he says you being a people of promise you live for the fulfillment of the promise not just what's going to be a roof over my head what am i going to eat what am i going to wear gentiles seek those things and paul picks up on the same idea and says the gentiles walk only in the vanity of their mind worried about what am i going to wear what are people going to think about what i wear where am i going to sleep what are people going to think about where i sleep what am i going to eat what are people going to think about the pictures i take of my food and share them with others what are they going to think and he's saying that's how gentiles think he says it's in the vanity of their mind and then notice how he gets really to the root of the problem having the understanding darkened it's an ignorance of what is better it's an ignorance of the divine their understanding is dark and being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their hearts if their hearts could see if their hearts were made open to be able to understand the things of god then they wouldn't be walking in the vanity of their mind would you still be doing all the things that a gentile does sleeping in a bed having a roof over your head eating and drinking and being clothed yes but it wouldn't be vanity because you would come to this conclusion that that what i must do is fear god and keep his commandments that this is my duty it's not just what can i eat what can i wear what can i have because my heavenly father knows that i have need of those things so my duty is to seek first the kingdom of god and then god has a way of making sure that those things are real blessings to me and not curses my heavenly father will add those things to me make them a part of my part of my life and be sure that i'm taken care of and there's so many promises that a believer could look to to have that confidence but their understanding is darkened because their hearts are blind and they're ignorant as a result who being past feeling and this is even a spiritual wisdom and discernment a real consciousness an integrity of heart the kind that seth would have had in his son enos toward then men begin to call upon the lord they had this feeling to seek god they had this feeling to avail themselves to the promises of god who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness as we were reading in romans chapter one last time and i believe is romans chapter one with the the mindset that paul begins to describe humanity of we can go all the way back to genesis 4 and genesis 6 and even genesis 11 and see this is the depravity of man they've been their past feelings seeking god wanting to know his will wanting to know what's best and in doing so they've given themselves over to the flesh and that's how man has come to the astronaut age and beyond this is why we have um uh vehicles on mars right now drilling cores into mars and studying its rock samples and sending back high resolution pictures and doing these things because man has given himself over to science and they're more concerned about understanding the universe than the god who created it becomes students of the creation instead of the creator who in studying the creator you could resolve all the the the paradoxes that have arisen in studying the creation they've given themselves over to greediness this word greediness how did they come to a place of lasciviousness this appetite for the flesh this appetite for things that sensitize the flesh that produces this uncleanness with greediness now they're greedy it's not just yeah i'd enjoy it but it's a greed it's an inability to know what is necessary understanding dark and ignorance that is them they don't know what is necessary they don't find they're not finding what is sufficient there's this lack of contentment and simplicity if you're content you're not greedy if you're content you're satisfied you don't need any more but when you're greedy you want more give give me more i want more and brother branham says now these people have plenty of gold this is his assessment of revelations 3 17 the condition of laodicea this is part of god's diagnosis now these people have plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind now when you have the wrong kind of gold you can have a lot of it but it's still not enough right otherwise i mean really whenever people say you know tax the billionaires the billionaires would be like yeah i don't know what i'm going to do with all this go for it right but there's still something about men that's like well yeah i'm worth 100 billion dollars but what if i'm only worth 50 billion next year i mean i need to have some of this right it's because man is never satisfied even with wealth that accumulates he says he has plenty of gold but it's the wrong kind it was that gold that brought men's lives bought men's lives and destroyed them this is the natural condition of laodicea which has spiritual direct spiritual emotional psychological application to the condition of the age we live in they it was the kind of goal that buys men's lives and destroys their lives it was the gold that warped and twisted human character for its love was the root of all evil so they had a lot of material wealth they had a lot of possessions they had a lot of assets they had a lot of things that looked good on a balance sheet or we want to sit back and say well are we being blessed are we doing great things are things going well and yes they have a lot of gold they have a lot of possessions they have a lot of things they can brag about but it's not things that bring peace and contentment but things that whether by men's lives they get consumed by and people pursue and it warps and twists their human character to where they'll go to no end to see that they preserve this pretense or preserve these possessions so it warps their character which brotherhood says it's the love of that gold the love of those possessions the love of that wealth that's the root of all evil just as it cries the age cries of a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire it says i've got everything but it has a desire to get more to achieve more to find more not within a spiritual transaction and not through humility in a basement before god but to have power in what is its greed that corrupts man has become a perpetually wanting animal where nothing satisfies him completely he's never content what it's greediness and paul writes to timothy in 1st timothy chapter 6 verses 6 to 11. i have to remind myself sometimes to smile because i realize that i my resting face may not may look like i'm angry you're like man brother aaron brother aaron is mad no i'm just at rest you know i'm not in a bad mood i'm i'm actually i'm feeling so great right now i'm so happy i have a really good friend in texas where it's like it could be the best day of his life he'd be like man today is the best day of my life and then the next day the worst day of his life right so show some emotion man today is the worst day of my life it was just kind of always the same tone the same way and so i have to remind myself to smile so that you know i'm not angry with you when i'm reading to you from first timothy chapter six these are good things these are happy things first timothy chapter 6 verses 6 to 11 but godliness with contentment is great gain anybody read that scripture before this is truth we'd all should be saying word to that like yes yes this is it this is this is so relevant to the time i'm living this is so relevant to me right now 33 years old a newly married man or something wherever you are in life i'm actually not 33 i've been married for many years i'm just saying whoever's here who wants to put themselves in the scripture can say yes this is so on target this is perfect godliness with contentment is great gain to have this god god likeness a christ-like character a desire to please god and to be happy satisfied that that's enough if i could just achieve godliness that's great gain that's of great value that's worth having since we brought nothing into this world and it's certain we carry nothing out of it you're not going to take that gold chain to that other dimension we take our character with us and our legacy is all that is left we take her character and we leave a legacy he says in having food and raiment let us be there with content if you have something to wear and something to eat be happy be content be satisfied i said that's a little extreme in the day and age we're living in but let's start there let's start there if i have something to eat and have clothes be content with them come on something to eat and clothes to wear be content be satisfied find contentment even in those provisions we can even challenge ourselves sometimes i want this i want this i want to do this i want to do that we can just remind ourselves am i eating am i feeding am i my kids being fed do we have shoes on our feet are we are we are we dressed in other words do we have the necessities of life and i don't believe that paul should say well i mean if you're homeless get over it i don't think that's what paul's saying the necessities of life if you have the necessities of life if you if you have the things that are necessary then be content with these necessary things he says but they that will be rich those that crave and desire to be rich those who aren't just satisfied with what they eat and what they wear but they want to eat a higher priced foods they want to wear nicer clothes and they're not just satisfied with the necessities of life but they want it to be conspicuous he says they will be they that will desire crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and in a many foolish and hurtful lust which drown men in destruction and perdition this is this is the word of god dealing with something that's within our human nature to to have and to consume and to get they say listen be very careful about wanting to be richer and not just have uh have bought bitcoin in 2011 and still own a lot of it today it's not a currency that we're talking about possessions wealth material things he says for the love of money is the root of all evil is it the love of the dollar yes the dollar the assets the possessions the wealth the things that make life easier to live the things that would be attributable to riches the things that ultimately just cause the nervous tensions but it's all those things the love of money or the that's power to consume it's power to get its greed is the root of all evil this lush this desire to have the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after this ability to acquire this greediness they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows how did they air from the faith not by trying to figure things out and prove this and prove that but they air by pursuing the flesh but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness total different entry in the balance sheet totally different value system not just fl uh pursuing food enragement not just pursuing uh riches and wealth and possessions and the latest and the greatest but i actually want to flee that mindset flee the lust flee the love of money flee the covenant after flee the will to be rich not fleeing raiment and food but the will to be rich the coveting after the love of money flee those things and pursue righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness john wesley summarized this verse 11 this way in general they may all be summed up in one the desiring happiness out of god this is what john wesley concluded about this verse they can all be summed up the righteousness the godliness the faith the love the patience and meekness it can all be summed up in desiring contentment and happiness from god and god alone that's where you're going to find righteousness godliness faith love patience and meekness it is desiring happiness out of god god i want you to be my joy but the snare of laodicea is the lie of riches the deceitfulness of wealth and accumulation of assets and the possessions of certain things because the spirit of the age is to consume to acquire to to store up to have and paul is saying we should find this base level of contentment and knowing the necessities of life are taken care of that having having the basic needs and and think very uh personal about how these mechanisms work within your own heart because it works with different people some people can be completely satisfied with certain things but not with others so what you may pursue and find that you have to have in what is is actually problematic in your life may not be a problem for somebody else but they have the equal somewhere it's a pursuit they've got to have it and and i i by no means implying that this is indicative of a weakness or a problem but to it hypothetically there may be a person who could completely get by with a used car hey it gets you there it doesn't break down it's solid it gets good gas it's got really good air conditioning but yet it doesn't satisfy a particular desire within a person's heart they're kind of like yeah but that looks ugly right and like you know a minivan would really really be practical for a family of six right and you're just like man i promised the lord i made a vow i'd never drive a minivan and so i'm just just wanting to honor god and never drive a minivan i know it's a sacrifice because they're great i love them the new odysseys are amazing but it's a promise i made to god i fleeced the lord actually and he confirmed it many times you would you'd be just fine with the minivan that was used and you could pay cash for it but my goodness have you seen the new suburban right and and so there's a way that you could probably get by with something cheaper more economical more practical even maybe better gas mileage but there's some mechanism in you that just can't let it go and you've got to have something else like wouldn't just a cheap mid-level android phone really get the job done why do we need the i iphone pro max there's going to be another one it's going to be called the uber pro max plus and like 2 500 bucks let's do it i've been saving my stimulus checks what because you're not happy with something that gets the job done brother man makes this statement in several places and i believe it's so applicable he says i often tell young couples i always tell my young couples like this that happiness does not consist of how much of the world's goods you own but how content did you make yourself with the portion that's lauded to you happiness does not consist of how much you own and where you live and what you have and what you possess that's not what it consists of but a contentment how can you make yourself finding contentment in what's been given to you and what your lot is so this is it this is what we have let's find satisfaction with what we have if you can achieve today contentment with what god has given you today you will have contentment if he gives you more but if you're discontent now god could actually give you the more you've been begging for and guess what you won't be content and he just tested you say well i gave you that and you weren't happy with it you begged me for this and i wanted you to realize that even if i give you this you won't be happy because you never made yourself content with what i give you the first time you want true contentment find you want true happiness find contentment in what you have now and don't be don't be afraid to ask god for more lord i'm satisfied lord i'm happy but if you could if you would if it would be your will it's that pressure we put such a pressure on families and young families the pressures that are on young families these days especially in certain markets and i think phoenix may be getting to that place where a young family really can't afford to buy a house and they have the pressure of all the couples that got lucky enough to get married in 2007 when everything was worth a buck right you could go buy a 4 5 4 000 square foot house for 150 000 and yeah they ripped all the mirrors out but you could replace them with ikea mirrors right yeah they they tore all the carpets out but just do stained concrete all the hipsters love it i paint all the walls white turn it in a real beautiful house and now it's worth not a buck it's worth a million bucks and you look at all the young couples getting married today well we had bought a house the first year we were married it's like well you know yeah i've got 300 000 in the bank and i can't find a house i can afford right and it puts pressure on young families to buy to build to have this and to have that and stigmas placed upon families that uh even in certain zip codes where they have to live in basement suites i know we don't know what those are here but there's there's places you have to live why because the economy won't allow for it i don't make enough money to buy a house right pressure but if you could find contentment with the basement suite if you find contentment with a rental house you find contentment in the apartment complex then that there's true happiness in that and not feeling like you're a failure and you're less spiritual and you haven't been a good steward of your money because you weren't able to capitalize on market conditions that existed 13 years ago there's inequalities that exist i know we get all tense up and we talk about injustice and inequalities but you know a lot of us need to relax on that because there's true inequality in the world there's inequity there's un injustice that exist hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 he says let your conversation be without covetousness don't be jealous don't don't desire don't be this this greed and be content with such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen this lack of contentment soft living the pressure of riches drives us to consume more than we can actually enjoy the real danger i want to just maybe introduce introduce this thought it drives us to buy much more than we can afford paul says not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content philippians 4 11. whatsoever state i am in i'm content there's a saying that says a contented mind is a continual feast if your mind is happy you can feed on that contented mind is spirit always a nourishment a contented mind is health to your bones it's satisfied it lifts you up finding self-sufficiency in the sufficiency of christ is real contentment that in him and christ i can do all things as he tells the philippians i can do all things through christ that strengthens me be content with such things as you have i speak not in the state of want but whatsoever state i am in be content paul through trial and through testing had found contentment despite poverty and persecution he found it despite poverty and even prosperity he had found true contentment notice he wasn't restless if he had prosperity he wasn't restless if he was poor he wasn't restless he managed to accept what he had and find contentment in it be content with such things as you have for i will listen to that for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee now that's kind of an odd statement but it's it's expressed in this context for us to realize this is what discontent draws us away from that there's a way of finding satisfaction in i will never leave thee nor forsake thee that if i have him i'm wealthy if i have him i have health if i have him i have what satisfies this i actually have the one who can provide that if i have him that i have then i truly do not have need of anything other than a greater yielding to him so if i'm not satisfied if i have covetousness if i have greed if i have a lust for more and i'm not con content with what i have then i've somehow been pulled away from the fact that he says i'm right here i'm with you i got this i will never leave thee nor forsake thee to be discontent to have this insatiable appetite to be driven by greed draws us away from his presence benjamin franklin said money never made a man happy yet nor will it there's nothing in its nature to produce happiness the more a man has the more he wants instead of it's feeling a vacuum it makes one this that whole this whole analogy that brother franklin is expressing to us instead of filling a vacuum it creates a new one it satisfies one watt want it doubles and travels that want another way think of that money has never made a man happy yet there's actually nothing in the nature of money to produce happiness because the more you have the more you want instead of avoid being filled it's created another void if it does satisfy one thing it triples the want in another way it'll actually triple the need in that in some other sense it's exactly with the scripture ecclesiastes chapter 5 verses 10 to 14 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity if you love silver silver is never going to satisfy you if you love money if you love abundance if you love increase you're never actually going to be satisfied with increase why because you're going to want more increase this is how lust is never satisfied it's a switch that's never turned off it's only it only loses its emphasis in the moment but it's always gonna be there driving you when goods increase they are increased that eat them listen this is bible this is the word letting us know these are the dangers to giving ourselves over to the flesh and not being driven and guided by revelation and spiritual discernment that when goods increase you only increase the taking of them and partaking of them what good is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them with their eyes oh look at what all i have because that's all it's good for the sleep of a laboring man is sweet whether he eat little or much if it's gotten by honestly if you're satisfied with what your labor produces when you the sleep of that man he rests easy why he's content but the abundance of the rich will make not will not suffer him to sleep he won't rest there's no contentment there's always this drive in him there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt but those riches perished by evil travail by misfortune by bad things happening and he began at the sun and there's nothing in his hand knows there's nothing to pass down there's nothing to leave spend your whole life trying to accumulate wealth and then the moment it's all taken away and then you have nothing to leave your children but had you spent time in having christ-like character produced in your life that's something your children can benefit from through misfortune it's saying wealth can be lost but character and integrity cannot be lost through misfortune only increased saying if you love silver silver won't satisfy if you love abundance with increase it it's not going to be satisfied when your abundance is increased goods increase you just increase the consumption of it just gets right down into the psychology of man the way his mind thinks the way that he acts these are the transactions that man thinks he's going to give him pleasure so i ask you what kind of transactions are we engaging in which ones have the greater preeminence brother braham says the city of laodicea was a wealthy city it minted gold coins with inscriptions on both sides gold coins characterized the age so a gold coin which represents the ability to acquire or to consume the gold representing wealth or some sort of asset where there's a barter there's an exchange some sort of commerce where me having some asset a gold coin and scripted on two sides and it represents this gold which represents purchasing power in the ability then present to achieve to acquire something you have the ability to consume whether it be food or raiment or clothing material possessions he's this is representative and indicative of that city laodicea that is now representative in a type of the condition of the age that we live in he says a flourishing commerce existed because of it because of the ability to acquire because man's appetite for it that knowing that you had gold and you wanted something else i could produce something that you would use exchange for what i have and i would get your gold and then i could use your gold to get something else i wanted nobody was satisfied alone in their own production and they weren't self-sufficient and just living off the land and having food and clothing being happy they had to devise ways that man wanted this so i could capitalize upon man's greed and man is always seeking after this so it's not just a matter of meeting a need but capitalizing on the wants and needs of others to my own gain and greedy gain not just so that i could have food and clothing but so that i could acquire wealth and accumulate more buying power since the flourishing commerce existed because of it today now notice how it brings right down to what we're living today the two-headed gold coin is with us we buy ourselves out and we buy ourselves in this applies on a spiritual level absolutely this is where brother branham brings it to its ultimate uh application but i'm speaking to those that i believe god they have escaped according to revelations 18 4. they've left that spiritual climate in dogmas and creeds and personality and politics and false doctrine and all this religion and you've come to seek christ and just worship at his feet and abandoning systems and ideologies and you're worshiping god and truth and now we can begin to look at ourselves with me in this economy of god's word and wanting to serve him in light of truth there's still these things that try to press in on us still living in the age that's characterized by a flourishing commerce the two-headed gold coin is still with us we buy ourselves out and we buy ourselves in what are the thorns and thistles that are wanting to choke out the word seed that's sewn into your life and it may not be a false doctrine related to the godhead it may not be a false doctrine related to the church going through the tribulation it may not be a false doctrine related to a false prophet it may not be those things but it may be the lust of other things entering in listen to some of these statistics americans spend more than 1.2 trillion dollars a year on non-essential things it's just americans if you're not american you can say a man even louder spend over 1.2 trillion dollars a year on things that are not needed unnecessary items the average u.s person now consumes twice as much as they did 50 years ago this was in the year 2000 i haven't been able to find a calculation that quantifies it now so 70 years ago we probably consumed three times as much as they did before why why do we do that why is this so it's that commerce it's greed each one of us in the united states are targeted with more than 6 000 advertisements a day you say that's impossible start counting and within an hour you'll get so tired you'll be like you know what yeah i'm willing to think that that's probably right you'll count hundreds before you get out the door marketing logos slogans phrases even from the cereal box to your coffee we are bombarded with over six thousand i see up to ten thousand advertisements a day we see more advertisements in one year now than people 50 years ago saw in their entire lifetime in one year we will be bombarded with more advertisements saying hey buy this hey experience that hey you should have this hey you still own that that's lousy you should own this we're bombarded with more of that in one year than people who live 50 years ago would their entire lives live the 81 years that man was expected to live then and they would see so many advertisements in one year you see more than they ever saw in their lives could you imagine what would happen if you gave them a phone and they sat in front of a tv with infomercials all day oh my goodness never heard of such amazing things and a book by annie leonard nobody that i think you need to pursue or follow on twitter i don't know she just wrote a book called the story of stuff it says what is the point of an advertisement or an ad except to make us unhappy with what we have so three thou three thousand times a day or we could even say six thousand ten thousand times a day we're told that our hair is wrong our skin is wrong our clothes are wrong our furniture's wrong our cars are wrong and we are wrong right we're told and bombarded that advertisement's doing that everybody the world's doing everyone's doing it so let's not do that to each other he says in verse 11 that if you will come back to the word i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes you shall not destroy the fruits of your ground either shall your vine cast a fruit before the time in the field saying that in other words your labor will be fruitful it will be sufficient you'll be able to enjoy it and i will rebuke the devourer the devourer there the word that literally means consumer i will rebuke the consumer i will destroy god will destroy the consumer and i will bless the fruits of your labor you will find greater happiness when you obey my word the rebuke there's a rebuke to the consumer there's a restriction of the consumer there's a restricting of the devour i will take this spiritual consumption that is fed by my discontentment i will take that and i will destroy and i'll rebuke it so that you can find true happiness i will rebuke the consumer the consumer out there the consumer in me the things that swallow up our income the things that devour our assets there's a principle in the word of god that says if you put me first and you give me the the the the discipline or the obedience is the word i'm looking for give me obedience and serve me then even the desire within yourself will be reviewed and even the things that eat away at your health and the things that eat away at your assets they'll also be rebuked our economy is built upon constant consumption continuous continuous unending upgrade cycles there's a phrase called conspicuous consumption it's the uh the extravagant lavish spending on goods and services that you do solely for the purpose of displaying that you've got the money to do it conspicuous consumption is buying things so that people know why is it that uh that a lot of brands at a particular price point put their logo all over it right because you're willing to spend that much money on that so that people know you spent that much money on that when sometimes the things that are most expensive and have the greatest quality to them you would never even know it because it's not geared towards the people who could never afford it but still pay for it pay for it because they want you to know they did think about it there's a lot of things we spend a lot of money for that tells everybody that we bought it when there's things that if you really have the money to afford it you'd be fine buying it and everyone no one would need to know that those shoes are fifteen hundred dollars right or that purse is seven hundred dollars like it's called conspicuous consumption things that you buy for the purpose of displaying how much wealth you have it's the condition of the age planned obsolescence where things are you buy something and they've already programmed or are placed built within the technology itself that it's going to become obsolete it's a policy of developing a product with an artificially limited life in order to generate long-term sales volume so you shorten the replacement cycle they plan the obsolescence in other words like you're going to buy this phone and in a year we're going to have a new one and you might be on the fence i don't know if i want to buy a new one but in two years it's already built within itself to where you're going to have a degraded experience with the product and you're going to want to shorten the replacement cycle and go out and get something else i'm using phones because they're an easy target but it's like this with a lot of things it's planned that way so that you're constantly in the cycle the constant upgrade cycle the constant cycle of buying and replacing buying and replacing and the worst is not just the planned obsolescence but the perceived obsolescence where we are caused to believe that it's obsolete so we've got to replace it when in reality that nokia flip phone that motorola that you're you still have in the drawer will make phone calls just as good as the one you've got if not better we're in the habit and practice of consumerism and since it's such a habit i want you to ponder this it draws us into following certain social norms that are driven by consumerism and i i i want to i want to say this in a way of just provoking thought if god can awaken you to habits and dis you know uh the practices of doing certain things that have been achieved in your life by merely drawing you into the social norms and you could realize i am only doing this because kind of just the weight of the world the movement of everybody else this is what everyone else was doing and i didn't see anything wrong with it in its place but do i really need to be doing this what where what dominoes are falling when this is happening and maybe in another way i wish i would have probably uh maybe prepared this thought a little bit more uh diligently but we've heard of a siren song and we're hearing the siren song and it it's drawn it's all this seems so wonderful but what does it end up in death it's horrible it's really ugly it's awful but it's it's a siren song of oh this is going to be so good and this is everyone else is do it and this is going to be this is going to solve all your problems it's a siren song that leads to destruction so we read a statement from the journal of retelling that's not retelling as in you know spreading a rumor but retailing like retail shopping the journal of retelling that was in 1955 listen to what brother branham says in 1958 will the church go before the tribulation the answer is yes the bride will in the days of lot they were eating drinking mary and given in marriage planting building selling buying remember how we're using this luke 17 30 even as our basis for this this thought on revelation resolves complication oh there never was a day that so much commercial as today just use car lots and everything so much to you can buy a refrigerator this year and pay about four or five hundred dollars for it and next year nobody wants it it's out of style brother branham would be amazed to know that that price is cheap for cell phones now that this is applicable to the phones we carry in our pockets not these gigantic refrigerators that would sit in our kitchens now it's true of a device that you slide into your pocket or into your purse oh my goodness he says it's out of style don't you see where the commercial world has your nose to the grind will don't you see it this is your opportunity to take a step back and say lord give wake me up give me some wisdom to understand give me some spiritual discernment where is it in my life that yes i thank god i'm not out in the world sinning i'm not pursuing drugs and alcohol and women and i'm not i'm not in the this air in my the my i'm not into all this mixed up stuff but lord i'm trying to serve you but lord am i getting my face pressed into the grindstone is there a place where i'm getting away from i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee if i got into a place where i'm more dependent upon the economies and the social things and the entertainments of this world instead of finding rest in you don't you see where the commercial world has your nose to the grind wheel you can buy a car this year and next year it's probably as good as the one you could buy then it'll depreciate a thousand dollars because they changed the radiator cap come on somebody hello what is it all to think preachers do to get amens maybe i need to start coming up with them change the radiator cap or they've done some little silly something to it i'm going to wait till everybody says amen it's so true so true everybody instinctively hey man get keep going it's only a sales talk to fulfill the bible as it was in the days of no one in the days of love this consumerist world the sales talk the planned obsolescence the perceived obsolescence the conspicuous consumption this leisure spending all these things it's fulfillment of prophecy luke 17. you're looking at the fulfillment of prophecy over there what about the homosexual agenda what about this okay fine you want to talk about that because you don't fight with that is that why you want to talk about it because we can look it down on them right and we can say whatever we want about them we can cast them as evil and we can we can try to make them feel inferior because there's nothing wrong with us right as you drink your eight dollar latte right think about it there's a lot of things that's really easy to harp on and talk about when our our goal is to not feel better about ourselves because we make everybody else look bad but i want contentment in christ i want to cause i'm still holding my latte we want to come to the place where we're just accepting his grace for us we're falling in love with his word he means more to us than these other things and then we look at somebody who is insane we're like you know what there's a place of rest i found a joy i'm not i i haven't found an axe to grind i haven't found a platform and a political ideology that allows me to hate everybody else so i can feel good about myself but i found a love that you too can participate in and find freedom and liberty and satisfaction i found a joy that delivered me from suicidal thoughts i found a joy that delivered me from anxiety and depression i found a joy that delivered me from feeling absolutely devastated in crowds i found something that i where i belonged and i wasn't confused anymore about who i was it's a love and a joy that you could share and what does brother branham say it's only a sales talk to fulfill the bible what this consumerism the commercial world a commercial day the mindset and attitude of this age to lust for the wrong things because they have the wrong knowledge this desire for wealth a desire for wealthy goods in proverbs chapter 15 verse 27. brother ellie mentioned today he goes brother aaron the the stream used to have the stream to where you could see the quotes and scriptures when you were preaching i said we're wanting to make it harder to stream so you just come here so you feel like you're missing out we just need to come because streaming is no replacement for this what i was going to have brother john do is just go cycle through all the way to the end just real quick so you can see there's just there's a limited number of slides today this is what we have left just bounce through it real quick get all the way to james one say look he's got a few more slides left we're almost there look at that that's the end see so let's just go back to proverbs 15. we're almost at the end you're like yeah brother aaron but you used that number of slides in the first hour and i'm like fine you're right i get it but i really feel like i'm coming to an end here proverbs chapter 15 verse 27 he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house there's areas that our house becomes troubled our children become afflicted our marriages suffer and things become weak because we're greedy of great gain and if you're greedy of gain it troubles your own house it was seneca the younger the philosopher who said it is not the man who has too little but the man who craves more that is poor the poor man isn't the one that has little it's the man who wants more the man who craves more he's the poor man the man who has a little and he's happy it's better to have a little and and have righteousness you're content with what you have that's not a poor man you find somebody oh he drives an old model car and he doesn't have a new cell phone and he he makes this much an hour and this that cast i say all you want about those people say all you want about what they wear and what they do well they're not you know they don't go on vacations right say oh what you want about them but if they're happy they're not the poor one you are because you're not happy with what you have the poor man is not the one who has a little but it's the man who craves more that's the poor man why that troubles the house it robs it of its peace it removes the strength and the stability of a home if you're greedy for gain if you have this lust if you want to acquire it troubles a house not just the physical address and the walls are shaking but what could be a home is merely just a place to sleep what could be a real marriage is just a contractual relationship jesus says in matthew chapter 6 verses 19 to 21 he's saying lay up your treasures in heaven verse 20. for where you're verse 21 where your treasure is there will your heart be also lay up your treasures in heaven seek ye first the kingdom of god in his righteousness don't just accumulate treasures upon earth that can be destroyed and corrupt and can be stolen but there's something spiritual as laodicea had come to the place where their transactions were no longer spiritual i'm wanting to encourage you to have more spiritual transactions the saying is home is where the heart is the bible says where your treasure is there will your heart be also home they actually say of home it's the place where you have your deepest affection and emotional pull and it's sad to say that some of us have found quote unquote home in the wrong things where your treasure is it's that place where good and precious things are collected you take these treasures precious things collected stored where your treasure is that's where your hearts gonna be wherever you're storing up things that's where your heart's gonna be your ambition your mind your protection mechanisms your instincts if you treasure social relationships if god's ever calling you to a decision that you know you're going to lose them you'll not obey you'll snot too when you cry over it you'll not obey because you want to protect these social relationships because you value it more than serving god i know i can't do it i'll lose too much i can't no no i'm afraid to do it why where your heart is where your treasure is that's where your heart is what you value in your about what you think is most important what you think is what you should have and the the pretense and the personality whatever it might be even the money and the possessions well if i do that i'll have to get rid of this or this that happens that's why your heir discipline your protection your instincts will be to preserve this wealth to preserve this prestige and be instead of being willing to lose it all to serve him because i find greater value in christ it's a greater treasure than all the riches of egypt and laodicea the bible says in proverbs chapter 24 verses 3 to 4 now that i've laid my foundation let me get my notes out with that as a foundation ponder our text through wisdom as a house building and by understanding it is established if you're greedy of gain you trouble your house so what's the answer for greedy for gain if we have all these emotional mechanisms these heuristics and biases and emotional pulls and consumers and my noses to the grindstone i'm addicted to technology or i have this wand i have this desire i have even these physiological things that society has imposed upon me where i have to have this and i have to have that they've watched grown men cry years ago i don't know if anybody remembers blackberries they're not talking about a cobbler or a smoothie at nectar we're talking about the phone blackberry they actually did did studies where they took the blackberry away from these businessmen and they cried and they shook and they couldn't imagine life without the trackball they couldn't imagine well how am i going to live without that device you know what we've gotten way beyond that now it says through wisdom as a house builder by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches you want to make your house a home start here you want to make your marriage a real relationship start here you want to you want to build a church the right way let's start here let's not put all our energy and effort in just finding a better building where we can meet but let's make the most of our meetings let's make the most of our relationships let's make the most of what god is wanting calling us to do that's way beyond where we meet it's about a meeting but one in the air and that's what we give ourselves over to that's what has the preeminence that we can take through wisdom build a house to understand and establish it and make it sure and strong and by knowledge fill it up with the right things talk about a different buying power a totally different economy commerce and consumerism and all these other things and spending god says come by of me your transactions are totally carnal but come by of me and through that kind of transaction through that kind of exchange we can fill our lives up with real riches pleasant riches not deceitful riches things that really add value spiritually not just materially really takes the edge off when there's certain natural transactions that don't quite work out the way that you want them to and you realize you know what god did that for a reason the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding if the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom then we must first respect reverence fear god and keep his commandments in order for the house to be built by wisdom is a house built by understanding knowledge of the holy knowledge of the divine is understanding there's only through revelation of god and understanding of his word can we really establish and make our house strong and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled don't you want your house to be filled not with clutter not with things but with precious things precious and pleasant riches it's by revelation that we want to fill our house with enjoyable riches to know christ to know christ to pursue him that's what revelation it puts you in the mode of pursuing him but my brother loyal if you could come we have these two scriptures that remain ephesians 1 17. that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom in revelation in the knowledge of him the spirit of wisdom and revelation that gives you this deep personal insight into christ this mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word the humility of christ to take a step back from things that at the end of the day increase vanity and only serve to satisfy the flesh at the detriment of your relationship to christ not everything that our flesh enjoys is a detriment but we ought we have to have discernment to know that there's things that have our nose to the grindstone there's consumerism that has actually consumed us and he makes the promise and it does bring it back to simplicity do as my word commands obey me call upon me i thought i'd have the scripture in here well there it is it's james chapter one i i forgot that this was in here we got to come to this place where in our hearts we begin to say god i need you and i need to have the right kind of wisdom and revelation i need the right kind of insight into what's beneficial i must have spiritual discernment i i i will say this with honesty that i know how overwhelming it can be to look at everything that is out there and like how are you going to do it how are you going to get through this all the different ideas and influences and opinions of people even about what we believe and why you should do this and why you shouldn't do that and why this matters and why that doesn't matter and you can just take one little thing and begin to look at like this is how are you ever going to figure this out do i have to take his word for it his word for it i thank god for the inside teacher i thank god for revelation thank god for faith i thank god for grace to look at another man who may see things just a little bit differently say well and have this liberty in my heart to say well this is what i'm living by faith i see where you're coming from i see where you base that on brother let's pray together because we know we both want to be right but the platitudes and the politics that complicate things and make people come to a place where they just want to run away from it all that's man that does that and that's just in one little tiny area that my mind is drifting to look at all of it whether it be how you should eat what kind of uh whether or not your pillow has copper lining and everything we use you know that causes cancer don't you everything you're like what do i do i can't wait till i can levitate you know walking causes cancer everyone who's ever got cancer you know most of them have walked and so there's this correlation we're trying to work out scientifically they think breathing has something to do with dying they're just looking into it so what how are we gonna how are we gonna navigate i need you lord i i need you to be able to navigate all this and it says in james chapter one verse five as you look at this scripture through wisdom as a house builded by understand it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with precious and pleasant riches the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom knowledge of the holy knowledge of the divine is understanding and paul prayed that god would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him paul prayed that that's a prayer that i would have for you it's a prayer that we should have for ourselves and he says james says if any man lack wisdom brother aaron i feel like i lack wisdom to navigate laodicea i feel like i lack wisdom to raise children i feel like i lack wisdom to work things out in my marriage i feel like i lack wisdom to make the right kind of financial decisions i feel like i lack wisdom and all these different things let them ask god okay i'll ask the lord that giveth to all men liberally and won't chide you or degrade you because you asked and abradeth not in other words if you right now today as we close this service say god give me wisdom he won't go wisdom he'd say yes yes if you ask for a 10 he's going to crank it up to 12. because he's going to give liberally you want wisdom i'll give you wisdom if we lack wisdom let's ask god for wisdom he gives liberally and he will not obey us and it shall be given him is there something within your heart within your nature within your life today whatever skosh of believer dna you have in you right now say god i believe i will ask for wisdom and have the kind of faith to believe that he will give it i'm just going to believe it right now i'm going to believe that i can ask god for wisdom and the bible says it shall be given him not if you're in a doubt not even try to work through the the iterations of this that well have i done this and have i done that and haven't done this i haven't done that no if a man if a man if you lack right now wisdom ask god for it yes god's not afraid of the effect his word's going to have on you [Music] ask gonna be given wisdom what wisdom are there wisdom for the moment wisdom for the decision you're facing right now wisdom for the very thing yesterday that you said you know what i don't know what to do with this that's the wisdom you can ask for it's not this general idea where you could be like a solomon who could figure out at any moment who's lying but wisdom that's relevant wisdom that's pertinent it says let them ask god let's stand let's pray together and let's ask god ask god as a family you can ask god as a wife i will ask as a husband i'll ask as a father you could do it as a mother i'll ask as a friend i'll ask is your brother we can ask together as a church god give me wisdom with your heads bowed i'd like you to make that a personal request today and you would do it even by lifting a hand high to the lord and saying lord i'm asking today for wisdom if wisdom is how a house is built and being greedy of gain is what troubles my house then lord i need wisdom doesn't matter to me if you're the smartest man in the room if you're the wisest man in the room you'd be wise enough to ask god for wisdom with hands held high some with two hands hearts raised hearts open before the lord let us ask god for wisdom right now knowing and i i want to say this and i rebuke any lie any instinct any feeling that it's not true let us ask together unified in believing if we ask god for wisdom he will give it liberally he will not upgrade us and it shall be given you our gracious heavenly father we're standing with our hands raised today and lord we are asking very simply that you give us wisdom lord i was pondering a thought in my mind decisions decisions decisions lord i even thought that perhaps that's be what we would minister on decisions decisions decisions but as i come to this scripture today i realize that every decision we want to make in some way we're wrestling with whether or not it's the right one or which one is right and lord you've led us to this scripture today at the close of a lengthy sermon that says if we lack wisdom to ask and it shall be given to us so lord for the moment for the decision for the circumstance we're in we're asking for wisdom lord i do not want man to print out statements and print out scriptures and print out references and hand me a list of things that have been said to try to figure this out but god i need wisdom i need wisdom in the word i need wisdom in the message i need wisdom of your of your thoughts and your teachings father that i can even take this knowledge that i have and begin to make sense of it in my life it can really be useful to me lord i'm praying today for us as a body as a father as a mother as a husband as a wife even for our children we have young men that have been recently baptized lord we have god dealing with young people's hearts and souls that are being saved lord we all today right now unite we do not look down upon anybody else we're not even looking up to somebody else but we join shoulder to shoulder we're standing side by side we're locking our arms or holding our hearts together and we all in unison say god we need wisdom god give us wisdom give us wisdom and it shall be given so father before i open my eyes i thank you for this wisdom i thank you for the knowledge and understanding i thank you for taking that knots that have been twisted and bound up and family problems and poor dynamics and twisted perversions lord i thank you for taking this very complicated relationship that i don't know how to navigate lord this decision that i was very afraid of lord i thank you right now that you gave me the wisdom i'm thanking you for it lord because i know if i don't have it now it's coming because you said you'd give it to me and i will not leave here making a bigger mess of this rubik's cube i'm going to hold this to my heart saying god will give me the wisdom it's coming to make sense of this it's coming to navigate it and we thank you lord for the wisdom that you have granted strengthen us we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
