TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 9 verses 1 to 7 i'm going to come back to verses 5 and 6 rather quickly but i wanted to read these verses surrounding it as god has given a blessing to noah as they have departed from the ark and god has judged mankind for their thoughts being only evil continually god even himself saying the end of all flesh is before me and he judges the earth then god makes these statements to know it as a blessing upon noah and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth what a striking commandment sins that he'd given this to the man and the woman in genesis 1 26 and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall you not eat and surely your blood or your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require and at the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man who so sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man and jew be fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein bless you could take your seeds i have a very very simple thought this evening and it is one that is very fundamental and i trust will be a blessing to you my title is god is the good god is the good and i am pondering the next subject that we've been studying and we believe the lord will just open up to us for maybe a few services on i am the open book i am an open book i just it seemed to fit to me this is a subject that i had been studying god had dealt with me on to minister some time ago and was just waiting for the right moment to do so and it just seems to be a really good fundamental service because there's a way that we think and i'm just going to take my time and express this as we consider the title god is the good we can think in a way to where there's there's elect and non-elect there's those that are of god and those that aren't of god and we kind of have that that way of viewing things and thinking about things and there is there is a truth to that there is an application to that those who are elect those who are not elect but we can tend to think so uh with such distinct uh such a distinction that we feel well there's those that are of god that believe the message and they're the ones who are not evil and then everyone else is serpentied right and that's kind of just the way that we we view things i remember one time someone shared with me a testimony and uh they were sitting down to eat with somebody and they said see this room it's full of serpents and uh and and that's kind of the at we walk around every day looking at everyone as serpent seed but just in that concept we kind of miss really what the truth is of the original sin and the resulting mongrelizing or hybrid into the blood and realize that really all of us were born of a woman born between even satan all of us have carry within us that stain of sin but i i want to address i want to just use this as a very simple thought to give us a principle that you have to you you need the holy spirit to kind of take a hold of it and i believe we could we're speaking to those who let the lord do that now just to start off on a positive note i want to define the word cynicism did you get the irony of that start on a positive note but there's uh just to define this cynicism i found this definition in researching just the word and where it came from and instead of getting to maybe the philosophical scholarship definition of it it's a perverse disposition to put an unfavorable interpretation upon conduct so if you are a cynic or cynicism is kind of a a perverse they used as a perverse disposition the in any time something is done you view it negatively you put an unfavorable interpretation to it so if you see somebody giving somebody money you just naturally assume oh that's a drug deal or oh they're they're trying to buy them off and so that's kind of what a cynic would do is there's any situation you view it in an unfavorable light so to be cynical and what providing these definitions for you so you could see them and ponder them to be cynical is believing that people are motivated by self-interest if you see somebody acting they're doing it for themselves you see somebody doing something oh they must have something to gain from him and then it's also to mean to be distrustful of human sincerity or integrity you're familiar with the word cynic or cynical or cynicism right and so i just wanted to define these because this is what i'm wanting to address in this subject we say god is the good is to address the the cynical part of our nature if there's any kind of cynicism in our life to where we see something we hear something somebody says something we hear something is taken place we just naturally instinctively uh just assume or believe that it's uh it's for their they're being selfish or it's for their own interest or they're not sincere they're not doing it in an upright way or we think oh well that just must be evil that just must be the devil we need to be very quickly or very uh very cautious that we don't quickly assume the worst or the negative when we hear something maybe another way that this could be defined is pessimism it's a tendency to see the worst aspect of things or to believe that the worst will happen and i'm using this maybe to drill down more of what i'm talking about because there's a there's kind of a way of thinking where we realize that human beings act to fulfill certain needs and they just always do that there's a hierarchy of needs or when we look at economics and you if you use economics as the means by describing or defining or interpreting behavior you say well there has to be something coming from this that makes somebody feel good there has to be something coming from this activity that is a benefit that the person is deriving but it's not always money and it's not always something that might advance somebody economically but people will act in an altruistic way and act in a very sincere way and act with integrity and honestly in not just to rip somebody off not to get ahead of somebody else but they do it sincerely they're doing it honestly they're doing it for good and and it it's the truth but that they're acting that way but if we're the cynic we have a hard time believing that right and it and so another way of looking at it is maybe to divorce itself from maybe these base instincts and maybe an economic justification for something but it would be our tendency just to see the worst aspect of things to believe that the worst thing will happen it's a lack of hope or confidence in the future or this habitually expecting the worst uh and or uh if i i don't know if i even provided that on there it's a lack of expectation or hope or confidence in the future or just expecting or just exaggerating the evils of life that's what you fixate on that's what you look at that's what you concentrate on the evils of life the bad things are happening uh to be pessimistic it's just kind of a depressing view of things oh great this is gonna happen oh wonderful this is gonna happen it's the old boy that's that's the pessimism uh that we're talking about habitually uh instinctively expecting the worst of things and now that that's the positive note i wanted to begin on because that's what i want to address if we never come back to cynicism pessimism or being cynical or this negativity and expecting the worst and exaggerating the evils of life if we don't come back to that i want you to remember this subject matter is to address the critic and the skeptic in your heart address that part in our spirits that hopefully we can become less critical less cynical less pessimistic now genesis chapter nine as we've already read it and um and it's very fresh in our minds how god is blessing noah and he's given them he's given him quite an extraordinary blessing it's changed just a little bit from how he blessed adam where now it's the fear of every beast is going to the fear of man is going to be upon every beast so we know something has shifted something has changed but yet he's telling him to be fruitful and multiply and replenish and then in verse five and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the end every beast will i require it and at the hand of man and at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man and then this verse is where i want to begin whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed it says for in the image of god made he man this is quite the statement this is after the fall right where this our bible is working chronologically here in genesis chapter 9 after the fall after the flood and god points out that man was made in the image of god truly if we read it in genesis chapter 1 and we looked at it we would understand that yes adam was made in the image of god adam being a spirit being was first made first a spirit being and that was in the image of god and then he's placed in flesh and we recognize that and we wouldn't wrestle at all in genesis chapter 1 and genesis chapter 2. we wouldn't even wrestle at all with respect to adam that he is in the image of god and he was a reflection of god but god picks up after the fall even after the flood and he re-emphasizes this truth and he says man is made in the image of god for in the image of god god made man and so there's an important truth embodied in this fact because god says it and if god says that it's fact we can accept it that now as he speaks about humanity and mankind that's going to usher forth from noah and his three sons do we look at it and say this is a this is a fact that these men this humanity mankind is still in the image of god and there's an important truth that we must respect in this adam was made in the image of god but here if i could rephrase it for in the image of god made he-man it says in one translation for to kill a man is to kill one made like god think about that for to kill a man is to kill one who is made like god so even though adam fell and then there's a subsequent generations uh that come forth through has fallen mankind and there's a mixing there's a mongolizing there's a hybrid and all of mankind god says is plagued with evil and their thoughts and imaginations are only evil continually there's still an image of god that remained in humanity even though the holy image was lost as soon as man sinned even though there was a a divine nature that left them in the garden what i want you to consider and i'm going to substantiate this using the message of the hour because again i said my my thought is very very simple that even though the holy image left them even though there's this divine nature that was lost in the garden of eden the channels clogged up there's still an imprint of the divine that exists within humanity there's still a if i can say a shadow of deity there's still something that's in that spirit of man that god made and the message law have in his shadow brother branham is talking about eve and he said he's describing her as being a very beautiful woman and that this artist had rendered her as being very ugly and haggard and he's saying that that's nonsense she was a very beautiful woman and he begins to describe her and he says i see her sitting there and her hair hanging down her back and her eyes was as bright as the stars of heaven he says when adam looked at her it put such a shock that still lives in mankind and we amplified this statement to a much greater degree about a year ago but in revisiting it i just want to make this point that brother branham is describing the moment that adam saw the woman he says when he saw her she had such a beauty and having come from man in this affinity between the man and the woman that when he sees her he says it put a shock that still lives in mankind that moment of the woman becoming a revelation to the man it it triggered something in adam and brother i'm saying it's still this shock is still reverberating still within men today you follow me that there's a there's a maybe a thought or feeling or an instinct that brother man says you could trace all the way back to the moment that man saw the woman and it says a shock that still lives in mankind today now if it could be that way of the man seeing the woman i'm wanting just to use that as an example of how that something that was with an atom this shock that was put in him has survived till this time though it could be manipulated it can be perverted though it's not maybe in its purest form as it was there with adam despite time without despite the delusion of adam's nature there's still something that's in man that god had created brother ben mentioned it in his testimony of how that brother branham when he uh was testifying to that infidel he was using nature and in describing nature what was he what was he trying to bring up an intelligence that was greater than what man could figure out and he was pointing to a divine nature we may call it mother nature and how but that mother nature was put there by god god designed that so nature speaks of god and you recall how brother branham tells the testimony of the salvation of bert call and there i think was in miami or new england hunting at the pond of safety and he told the story of how that a call was used uh to mimic the sound of a fawn in danger and there was this mother deer who poked its head up and knew the hunter was there but yet that call was was working on something within this mother's nature and he says this mother dare put herself in danger knowing that she could be shot but there was something in her heart that was being pulled upon out of with this fear that maybe one of her own was in trouble and brother branham tells the story that mother dear a number of times and he says that she a mother deer displayed genuine love think about this this is an animal now i know it's not going to be hard for eliza to believe this but because she loves all animals and she's a great defender of animals but a lot of us might think an animal displaying true love a mother dear is going to display true love and you read the instance i went through and started reading all the instances where brother bram talked about it and he uses he describes it that this deer expressed a divine love that that's what was seen that what what bert had seen in this mother it reflected something of a divine nature it reflected something about god and something about his character and and that's what really got to the heart of bird as a sinner and he gave his heart to the lord and became a very extraordinary conservationist and has a testimony even to this day among certain circles as to um his his attitude towards conservation and nature and so the this this what brother madam used as an example he says don't you want to have a love like that mother deer had and this is this is speaking to us don't you want to do that so even in nature even in nature falling nature the fear of man is upon these beasts and we don't look them at them as being redeemed and we see this cycle of procreation that's taking place over thousands of years but yet there's still a nature inside of them that speaks of the character of god and brother branham in the message question and answer says and he put the spirit of man in this animal man here he created him first in the image of god as a spirit then he says the spirit is placed in flesh and he calls that flesh the animal man because we realize that a man without the holy ghost is likened into an animal there's there's this animal nature that's still he's still subject to you put that spirit of a man in this animal man here and he become a living soul now that's the difference between a man and an animal the animal don't build automobiles and he doesn't do things like that to help his living and so forth like that he's an animal dumb brute he's got no he hasn't got a soul he can't read and write he can't talk speak he's a dumb brute but a man is in the in flesh like a brute but he's got a soul of god in him what makes him immortal he's got a soul of god in him that what makes him immortal and that's not the catholic doctrine of the immortality of the soul but it's that soul that is judged by the second death it's going to be the soul that soul that ultimately dies he's got a soul of god in him what makes him immortal and he can invent look what he can do he's almost an e on equal with god because he's the son of god even in his fallen estate he's wonderful now this is not uh the humanity and mankind even in his fallen estate there's something about humanity and there's a lot of scriptures we can use maybe a lot of other quotes we can use but what i want you to realize is as brother man begins to describe this person he's not just describing them in genesis chapter 2 but he's saying even now today there's a soul inside of him that can come that came from god he can invent he can almost eat with god he's a son of god even in his fallen estate there's something wonderful about mankind humans still have instincts and desires and abilities that speak of the divine despite their fallen nature in the message thirst i think this one will certainly resonate with you if you're uh wanting just to be invited into this and compelled into this more this will do so it says i've had people tell me oh i never did thirst for the things of god want the things of god i believe it's just for some people to want to be christians he said oh no that's wrong it's actually something that's associated with every human being now think of that because we got it we kind of got it down to where you're either elected or you're not right you're either elected or not and i'm not taking that don't get nervous i'm not taking that away but he's saying that in the heart he said that everyone this desire to be a christian or want to be a christian there's something about that he says it's actually something that's associated with every human being it certainly is true when we come to this country in the early days we found the indians here and the indians though they were heathen at that time they worshiped the son or something listen as long as they are human there's something in them a natural thirst calling out for god somewhere as long as they are human there's something in them you say oh well that's just for christians that's just for people who want to be christians he says no it's actually something that's associated with every human being so in every human being there's some divine thirst within every human being there's some divine attraction there's something toward god there's something related to god in all men and that's why a heathen will worship something they'll have something to be a god they make god out of the moon they make a god out of the sun they make a god out of the elements of nature why it's because some instinct or desire inside of them that wants to worship something it's a thirst put there by god a divine a divine something he says as long as they're human there's something in them calling out for god now this statement it kind of opens up into a much larger room to explore but i want to just kind of peek in real quick but in the greatest battle ever fought he says there's only two forces satan and god all right i know this dichotomy sometimes we really wrestle with there's only two forces so we say well i want to go to i want to go eat tonight i want to go to ihop and i want to have as many pancakes as i want to eat well is that god or the devil right there's only two forces what's driving me to do this but he says there's only two forces satan and god and what is satan's weapon against you and i wanted to keep this in there so you can recognize well there's two forces there's a way that satan works is the way that god works this is how satan works he's trying to get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon as equivalent if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you so different ways he describes this but satan's weapon is to get you to disbelieve your weapon this is what he uses against you he disarms you by getting you to disbelieve that your weapon is as great as his or not as strong if he can get you to believe it's not as strong as his that's how he works so how does satan work he works through disbelief that's how satan works there's only two forces there's the force of god and there's a force of satan satan can only only works for through disbelief and satan cannot create so he can only pervert so it's not that satan has all the material in the world or doesn't have any material to work with so he just creates it he has to work with what god gave him and so satan if there's two forces in the world and one is of god and one is of satan satan works through force and he works through unbelief and cause you to doubt and cause you to worry cause you to fear and he can only take good things and pervert them bill abraham said there's two elements that control all people fear faith only two elements only two forces god and satan only two elements fear of faith now when you begin to think about it that way we can't take this two forces god and satan and then two elements faith and fear and then try to put people in those buckets but we're looking at influences we're looking at motivation we're looking at design god designed the woman a particular way satan redesigned her god created the earth for a purpose satan is trying to use it for another and so we look i want you just to kind of think in this uh uh uh just to ponder this very deeply how that there's these forces that exist in the world there's these elements that exist in the world and that evil resides in man because of sin had there not been sin there wouldn't be evil resonant in mankind had the woman never fallen there wouldn't be this evil instinct within humanity and we recognize satan is a force in this world fear is an element in this world and we and we see the evil all around us but i want to ask you a question what about the good in life what about good things in life what about things that you enjoy or things that other people enjoy what about good people and if i could say this way as i read this quote and pondered it his weapon is disbelief if satan by disbelief can get us into cynical cycles we're just we're always the critic we're always the skeptic we're always doubting uh we're just very quick uh very quick to dispute or to argue the contrarian where it's just almost instinctively and i speak this very honestly i think it's a mcgeary trait i i just just to take the opposite side like one day you can say the sky is blue the sky is blue and the next day you meet somebody who's saying it's blue and you're like hell hold on and wait a minute i don't know i mean because somebody else has the idea you got to change now and you got to be the contrarian we can't be that way we don't want to be that way if we do we can actually lose the proper view of god and we can actually begin to skew god's will because we kind of put our we're putting our own imprint on it our our skepticism our cynicism brother manna makes the comment he says that pastors are suspicious people but he never said that so that we could sow suspicion into the people right it's okay for us to be suspicious we got a job to do and that that may be part of our nature but when we sold that into the people we're not doing our job and so i'm not i don't want to sow suspicion into you i want to i want to give you confidence in the spirit of god that's leading you i want you have confidence and the discernment that the word of god can give the elect in this hour but if we're always kind of moved by cynicism and pessimism i am coming back to it so this is good if we're moved by those forces then we can we start to view everything with such a negative outlook that we'll miss the will of god and most importantly the will of god for our lives we could even miss opportunities in the things of god because they're always just instinctively critical brother brahm says in the message victory day he said he's the god of the human race and if he's god at all he's interested in every human being because it's his creation interested in every human being because it's his creation sorry brother aaron i'm only interested in those that believe the seventh seal is opened according to the message of the hour okay well that's not like god that's revealed under that seal he says he's interested in every human being because it's his creation and he's interested in the children he's interested in the old age and the middle age he's interested in the colors of us and all the white the brown the black the yellow the different shades of skin from the country that we come from in our forefathers he's interested in all of us he's just not interested in the jews alone or in the yellow race black race white race whatever it is he's interested in the whole human race in trying to get the human race to focus his word down to one thing and say there is one god and that god give an innocent substitute by come becoming himself man in order to take away sin to save the whole human race this is the nature of god god yes he he loves the elect and his love is to the bride and he has a very specific work that he's going to do uh uh with the with the holy spirit in the word of god in the elect but he says god is interested in all mankind you realize that god is so interested in mankind that though he created the earth to get a bride out of it people who work together with god's program to see that that's achieved even though they're not bride they receive a grace if they fulfill god's purpose that god would that no man should be devoured that no man would be lost this is god's will this is god's attitude this is his heartbeat and so god is interested in the whole human race trying to get this human race to focus on his word he desires to see that they would they would that they would recognize christ god is great enough that he could pour out his spirit right now into this room and it only fall on the elect couldn't he couldn't he do that where where uh he has heal in his wings he he has joy he has peace he has deliverance and he can raise from the dead and he could restore limbs god could just discern and god knows who's elect and he could say oh you you want to be healed of cancer sorry you're not elect but does he isn't there so much in the word of god that people are partakers of and they benefit by and they enjoy the bible says the rain falls on the just and the unjust the the wheat rejoices in the sun and the rain just as much as the cockle bar god if he wanted to could cause a drought upon this plant but a rain upon another he's god he could do it if he wanted to but he's got an interest in every human being he's interested in the whole human race there's a statement brother says that man was made to be a god and god was made to be man that means there's something really important about this humanity something unique about the flesh in matthew chapter 19 verses 16 and 17 it says and behold one came and said to him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life and he said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments he said there's none that is supremely good or essentially good but god we could read it this way and say that god is the only true good he is the only pure good there is none good but god god is the only good good master what can i do what good thing can i do to have eternal life he says why are you calling me good there's only one good but god i think that could open up a brilliant theological debate at that moment say what is he trying to say if he's calling him good and if he is in fact good then he must be god but he's saying there's only one good and that is god when he uses the word good it means of a good nature one that is useful pleasant happy excellent upright honorable there's only one this good and it's god and psalm 16 verse 2 this is this is a scripture that uh has been interpreted different ways it says oh my soul thou has said unto the lord thou art my god my goodness extendeth not to thee some translate it to mean that there's nothing good i can do for you there's nothing i can add to your glory but a lot of translations render it this way i have no good beside or beyond you oh my soul thou says unto the lord thou art my lord my goodness is not without you if there's any good it has come from you if there's any good in me it is because of you if there's good in my life oh lord it is you because i have nothing good beyond you i have nothing good beside you to say my goodness extenteth not to thee that there's nothing good except it came by your hand james chapter 1 verses 16 and 17 it says do not air my beloved brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning are you following these scriptures maybe i'm positing i say god is the good and that's my that's my title and then where i stepped into this is to look at god's declaration about man in genesis chapter 9 and what he says about man is man in his fallen state after the flood still is in the image of god that doesn't mean deity dwells in him uh in life and that his that zoe is in him and he has eternal life and he's a fully adopted son of god that's not the point i'm making saying that there's something in the creation something in the man that god still acknowledges that his image is in him and then brother branham goes so far as to say that there's something wonderful about the man he can create he can do these different things he can invent rather and there's something wonderful even in his fallen estate he he has some affinity with god and i want you to consider this that if they're a message believer or not a message believer if they're from india from new zealand from china or or from south america north america it doesn't matter they can even be canadian and there's and there can still be even an agnostic even an atheist there's still something about the person that god is interested in that god says he's interested in every human being because it's his creation he's interested in the whole human race and trying to get the human race to focus on the word of god so though evil resides and is resident in man because of the fall that man was originally made to be a god and god was made to become a man and so still in all of this as long as we're human there's something in us calling out for god something that if i if i could just i thought maybe cover it up and though it may not it may be misguided it gets perverted but there's some there's some inclination there there's some there's something in them that could acknowledge god but what does the scripture tell us they refuse that they refuse to believe that they refuse to consider that and that's the part that becomes deadened or becomes hardened and jesus says there's none good but god david said there's no good besides you james says every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights every good thing cometh from god every good thing now all right let's go ahead and just define good as those things that we can identify in the scripture and we can start narrowing it down but you say every good thing every good thing cometh from god and the message when their eyes were opened it says and so we know the great things are done in the hospitals and amongst doctors and so therefore we've got to recognize that to be of god because all good things come from god all good things are you able to read that i challenge you to go look it up and we could say well he just didn't know how far western medicine would go in 2022. all right i mean we can always debate that that brother branham just didn't know but he says we've got to recognize that to be of god because all good things from come from god all good things he said if there's these things that are done the great things that are done the positive things the things that benefit the things that bring life or bring um preserve life or deal with sicknesses and and treat certain ailments and mend things together he says these things that are done in hospitals by doctors we've got to recognize that to be of god he says because all good things from come from god all good things we believe that god is the source of all life we understand that god is the source of all intelligence he's the source of all honor he's the source of all wisdom and and and i'm wanting you to ponder the greatness of god and just how great he is and just how wonderful he is and how that we ought to never just narrow him down so and limit him so much to we miss out on seeing god everywhere that he is brother man says god is a creator god created everything all good things come from god and wrong things evil things are the right thing perverted do you see how brother brahms trying to place it there's evil in this world and evil is just the right thing perverted there had to be something good before there could be something evil that they're that the evil is the righteousness perverted the the the wickedness and the unrighteousness is the will of god detoured or violated or worked against and what what's the wrong thing well you don't know the wrong thing there's not a wrong thing unless there's a right thing have you ever heard that before when someone says well there's really not a wrong way to do it you ever heard that before it's nice to hear that sometimes you know there's not a wrong way to do it just means just get the job done as long as the job's completed but if there was a right way to do something then there's a wrong way and and this is this is just pondering this think about this maybe it's just provoking more thought for you brother bram says all good things come from god this scripture even says that as we read every good gift and every perfect gift is from above there's a lot of different translations that render it every good thing comes from god if there's some good if there's a good gift if there's a perfect gift where does it come from if there's a wisdom that presents itself peaceably and in righteousness where does that come from these things have to come from god i'll just i'll just say it ah and express it this way i i imagine every single person in here who's serving the lord who has the holy ghost can testify that god has spoken to you in many different ways and it's not always this traditional channel of a a middle-of-the-road message preacher speaking behind a pulpit right it doesn't always come that way sometimes it could be the person at work who's the farthest thing from a christian makes a statement and immediately in your heart you go that was the lord talking to me that was the lord the lord that was the lord and you have no doubt in your mind and you don't doubt it why because something resonates in your spirit says that's what i needed that was good that's appropriate and we don't have to wrestle we don't go to the bathroom i need to take a 15-minute break you don't smoke well i'm going to steam a little bit how in the world can that ignorant reprobate have a good thing to say no we just accept it and and we've listened to we've listened to christian programs on the radio and we hear something like that speaks to my heart that resonates with me have we not lived that haven't i heard that listen this is what i want you to catch when that happens that's god that doesn't mean the person is god that means god is mindful of you and is willing to speak to you through whatever channel he needs to to get your attention and god will use whatever he needs to to get his good out that if god's gonna use the radio he's gonna use the neighbor next door in the apartment next to us or whatever then i say god use me too oh god is it is have we come to the place now where good has to come from the rocks because we're not crying out enough we're losing our voice because we got negative we get cynical and and and we just kind of are huddling ourselves up and we're not open to be used of god there's an attitude anymore that if something happens uh where even somebody testifies and says oh did you hear about this person given a testimony and they said they went to the such-and-such church and they got prayed for and they were healed and the doctors they have x-rays to prove it and i've heard that testified before maybe an athlete getting healed and somebody else getting healed and i've heard message believers say oh that's not true i go wait why not why isn't it true well that that person's a sinner and they haven't done this and i said no no no what we're talking about is they were sick they had cancer they got prayed for the cancer is gone who does that it's not benny hinn no it's not deion sanders who does that god does that so i'm not trying to put my faith in the man that's healed i'm not trying to put my faith in the man that did the praying i say that's my god and i can rejoice with anybody who lifts up the nature and the character of my god and i don't have to fight against it because truth only vindicates god signing what signs and wonders aren't meant to just to vindicate ministries alone and vindicate a person it vindicates god it vindicates his truth brother brandon even asked the question do you believe god is in all inspiration the congregation answered yes they must have they must have felt like i think he's saying yes but he just asked the question do you believe god is in all inspiration he said god has to write a song do you believe god is in songs it's a question he's asking do you know god heals by music god heals by love god heals by medicine god heals by surgery god heals my understanding god heals my care these are all ways that god heals so someone can care and god could heal by that someone can understand and god can heal by that someone can perform a surgery and god can heal by that uh god someone can music can heal but these are all just statements from brother bam god heals by music by love by medicine by surgery by understanding by care this is this is things that god does because god is the good there's any good it comes from god that's what i'm wanting to emphasize if you see something good god is the good wherever you see it wherever you experience it wherever you feel it if it comes your way and you recognize it thank god for it be happy to see it and this sermon jehovah jireh and it's a little bit of a lengthy lengthy statement but i'm going to i want to read through it and just bringing this to a close he says anyone knows that no man can heal another and just prior to this he's he's making a statement how that you know some people the critic critic will call a man a healer oh he's a divine healer he says the critics will say that why because no man is a divine healer he says anyone knows that no man can heal another god heals the sickness now he he uses some very uh profound i would say reasoning with arguments here to support what he's saying very profound and i want you to focus very deliberately at this pace i'm going to be closing uh under an hour so i think that's a pretty good pretty good pace for me and so you could focus now and concentrate pull hard i sometimes say the harder you pull the faster i preach but if you pull too hard the more i preach maybe i don't know i don't i haven't figured it out yet i'm sure you could tell by now he says god heals the sickness he says let god call for your death and pray all you want to and the hospital will give you an injection of fluid every day and you'll die just the same you let god call for your death and see if man can stop it if i cut my hand tonight and stand here with the cut hand and there isn't a medicine the world can heal my hand we ain't got a medicine that heals sorry for all your melaleuca salesmen it says no medicine heals any doctor will tell you that it just keeps clean why god heals it can't build tissue if i cut my hand and oh you say yes brother branham there's a medicine to heal that all right i want to know what it is he says let me show you if i cut my hand and fell down dead here a doctor could come and embalm my body make me look natural for 50 years sew up my hand and take me out there and give me a shot of penicillin every day and in 50 years from now that cut would be just like it was when it was made now that's very sharp isn't it i this is this is kind of taking a step back and instead of debating the merits of the actual medicine and what it does and say what you see here is what this medicine will do is this and what this procedure do is do that he's saying all right let's do it on a dead body and see what happens so what what is what these things are doing is they're working together with the body's natural process it's working together with something that's already there has something to work with he said if i cut my hand open and then died a doctor can do all sorts of stuff to it the cut's still going to be there if medicine was made to heal a cut why don't it heal it if it's a cut right that's a dead body but put the medicine out watch it he says any medicine will heal a cut in my hand i thought this was very interesting well he'll cut in this desk would heal a cut in my coat and this is this is this is really good to get someone thinking i'm pondering this well yes if it's the medicine that heals the cut then why can't i just put that medicine on a rip in my pants and it just it mend right back up he says if it would heal a cut it'll heal a cut no matter where it's at well you say why medicine is made for human beings then why don't it heal well you say the life has got out of you so that's coming back to the argument well why didn't the cut heal my body if i had a cut and i died and they did all this they said well you didn't have any life in you was brother man identifying he says then there's something else beside the medicine that heals something else beside the medicine heals it's life sure and life is god certainly it is yet some are sinners are perverted with it but yet you're in the image of god it says and the life that you have that god that god gave it to you you know that because god is the healer life is he says no and i think he's referring back to what heals he says god is the healer life is the healer do you see the picture that brother abraham has just caused us to consider that he says if if man is the healer then if god calls for your life there's nothing man can do to stop it so he recognizes god as being the one that's overall thing he he has the providence over mankind he's directing our affairs but now even when it comes to the human body god is the creator the maker of the human body and he's made it a certain way that as long as it has life in it there's things that can aid in the healing process but once that life is gone the body cannot heal itself and he's identifying i said look then if it's medicine if it's science if it's humanity if it's this doctor this procedure or this chemical or this approach he says then it would work on anything but he's saying it's got to be what god placed in there it's working together with something he says there's something else beside the medicine that heals it's life and life is god even for a sinner perverted in this life yet they're still in the image of god he says god is the healer life is the healer that ought to encourage every single person in here who's got a pain or an ache or sickness as long as you've got breath you're in the line of healing as long as you've got breath life is the healer as long as you've got breath you can say god i got breath lord lord use one is that your disposal father he says life is the healer i mean clothes are just summing up my my thoughts there are still brother i'm saying it there's there's even sinners perverted yet they're in the image of god there's still a a part of god an image of god that's present in mankind they're still they're still i wan i'm careful with the words i choose but something that's been imprinted by god's divine nature it's not the divine nature it's not god himself necessarily but it's something that shook mankind it's some impulse and some imprint something the fingerprints of god some way that he made man that even though he's become holy evil and he's lost his thoughts and he pursues the wrong things and he's motivated by the wrong things it's almost as if there's still some shadow in his spirit that there's still some good that lurks there in the dna there's still something in the base nature of man despite its evilness and despite its depravity and despite how dark his soul has become there's still something in there that brother branham says thirst for god there's still something in there that was made by god there's still something in there that god can use and so the thought god is the good if you see something good know that it had to come from god no matter where you see it no matter how it presents itself if you know something is good then you know that god is the good that's in humanity if if some sinner or some person you know nothing of their testimony no nothing of their situation if they do something good if they do something right god is the good but that can only be because god made man in his image in the beginning and that satan wasn't his designer and that satan didn't create humanity if if there's some glimpse of good if there's some glimpse of rightness if there's some cleanse of passion if there's some glimpse of integrity if there's some glimpse of honesty that had to come from god and i say don't resent good in whatever fashion it's expressed in regardless of something's belief or or their theology can we appreciate good when you see good when you see goodness when you see humility when you see service when you see a sacrifice you're seeing the attributes of god when you see selfishness and hatred and jealousy and wickedness and fornication and murder and lying and backbiting and stealing and all those things what is that's evil that's the devil that's the world but if there's good that's god because god is the good i encourage you don't be cynical don't only see the bad have you noticed and maybe only you could i can only relate to this and how i've seen it maybe there's a way that this is applicable but not the same way it is to me but i feel as if we are suffering from constant waves of sensationalism and and there's these waves of sensationalism that that ride on the the momentum of the day and and all of a sudden something happens and we get flooded with certain sentiments and everything everybody's picking up on this look at this look at this look at this and everything gets really really sensationalized and then all of a sudden it kind of goes away and what do we do we ride the next wave of sensationalism right at one time covet 19 was going to be what spurred the rapture right it was going to be a pandemic but now it's russia i'm sorry it's not the pandemic it's world war iii and we just we ride it's sensationalism and we just keep riding these waves and maybe we can keep going back and back and back and god's saying look as long as you're surfing you're never going to get out of here and he's just waiting for us to get off our boards start right stop riding the waves of sensationalism and just get in his channel and the upward momentum of the world and say wow look what's happening wow look what's happening but i'm staying in the channel i'm going to i'm going to ride through i'm not surfing them i'm questioning them i'm going against that if the world is crashing this way if sensationalism is going this way i want to ride across those waves i'm not going with the current of this world there's so many waves of sensationalism and there's so much pessimism fellowshipping with the brother and it's remarkable how that we don't trust the news so there's a maybe a healthy skepticism of the news and and we're and we're willing to believe anything that uh erodes the integrity or the truthfulness of the news but what happens now is we fall for lies about the news because it fits our paradigm and and what happens we're getting caught up and the pessimism oh can you believe this can you believe that can you believe this can you believe that can you believe they just believe that and and it's like well i don't know every everything you're quoting are things that's not an absolute to me everything you're talking about i don't know i i have no certainty in that let's talk about things we know so many things these waves of sensationalism these waves of pessimism it's trying to force on us a negative view a doubtful view where we go we go from the pandemic's going to be the end of the world world war three is going to be in the world all right what's next right any anybody else think that maybe this is just going to go away and there'll be something else covered 2022 i don't know gonna be something right that it'll be the the economy we'll figure all about the war in eastern europe and it'll be about the economy and then we'll be getting dozens of economy quotes right trying to explain where we are what's going on and how to view the world and what's happening i'm like man i thought for sure it was the vice president in a purple dress i thought for sure that was it and we'd all be gone but it wasn't was it because that's not what brings you perfect faith it's not what brings you rapturing faith and that message the junction of time i would i'm going to keep our musicians seated but just to create the expectation of a close typically at this moment i'd be calling them up but i just want everyone to be still in here this last statement and the message the junction of time how the great turmoil is in the world today and we realized one thing that caused that the bible said that the spirits great spirits come down evil spirits and got into these people and done these things and we see the same evil spirits working in our day amen both democrats and republicans can agree right evil spirits working in our day they might point fingers at each other but let's just agree as believers evil spirits working in our day we got a lot of suspicions and skepticism and and we could probably start to identify where all these evil spirits are working especially in sleepy joe and all these other places i know i know this is where it's at right i know this is where the evil spirits are working all right now notice again that not only that when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose also when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against it and these two forces have always showed at the junction well if all hell is broke loose and the biden administration then i want to start talking about the heaven that was let loose at the same time if there's a hell getting loose there's got to be a heaven getting loose and i want to stop talking about the hell and start talking about the heavens because it has to be if there's a if there's a physical pandemic and a plague upon the flesh then there must be a spiritual infusion of rapturing faith that's transfined in the word of god if there's something bringing people to a grave then there's got to be something bringing a bride to a rapture if there's a war taking place in eastern europe that's bringing down lies there's got to be a greatest battle ever fought that the word is going to wage right now in my spirit that's what i want to start looking for is the good god bless you let's stand tonight god is the good and i'm going to start looking for them i want to start seeing the good talking about the good fellowshipping on the good i realize it's easy would you agree brother loyal it's easy to talk about the things of the day easy to talk about vaccines and wars and uh political decisions and the prices of gas brother donnie reagan said a text message and he said good news we're closing this friday we got we got approved for the loan we're closing this friday on a tank of gas it's like wow that's just about that's just about right and it's easy to talk about those things but just remember when all hell turns loose heaven turns loose also then make that very personal have you ever felt like all hell turned loose in your life everything's chaotic everything's out of control then god must be near right brother jared it seems like everything's going absolutely crazy in bonkers even in that moment you can say wait a minute god must be near because hell won't turn loose and left heaven's going to turn loose also that's where we want to put our eyes amen heavenly father tonight as we close this service we want to keep our eyes on you we want to trust in you and we realize that the devil brother loyal mentioned it recently the devil's a great salesman and he has sold us on so many facts and figures and beliefs and ideas and paradigms even allowed certain ones to compete against each other this is the devil slick lord i think about it right now but he has his people pretending to fight so that we'll take a side and we need to just take a step back and say all hell's turned loose heaven where are you and pray for heaven to come down pray for heaven and press itself pray to see the good to see the positive to understand what it means lord even with current events and global events that are taking place we know that it's only going to work to further your purpose and that whatever happens we have a promise that all things work together for our good and lord i realize there's believers suffering right now in eastern europe and i i reached out to a brother there lord and just was so i just wanted to encourage them because father in my heart i believe they're fulfilling a part of this bride's perfect faith for their crisis their moment what they're going through we do have a responsibility to pray for them we have a desire and a responsibility to see if there is some way that we can meet their needs but lord i believe that we should view it not through the lens of sensationalism not through a political lens but through the lens of oh lord let heaven loose oh god let your spirit move lord may this bring a desperation in believers hearts lord may you preserve life may you begin to work things out in such a way to where it promotes an absolute confidence and dependence upon your word and lord i pray tonight that as a church if there be any cynical nature may the word of god address it if there be any pessimistic instinct if there be any cycles of cynicism lord what if there's things exist in our heart we're just quickly resort to the negative for contrarians by by reflex lord change that in us change that may that change be rooted in an absolute confidence in our calling that regardless of how good somebody else is it's never a threat to who we are [Music] somebody else is good somebody else's sincerity somebody else's testimony somebody else's work somebody else's move of god or power of god and somewhat something else that is that that is a true genuine outpouring of the holy spirit lord may we be so confident in who we are and what we called this do that we don't instinctively try to find something wrong with it just to make ourselves fear feel better but lord may we rejoice in all your goodness may we rejoice in your healings may we rejoice in your manifestations of gifts may we rejoice in however you would choose to move among the sons of men knowing that there's healing in this word for many there's deliverance in this word for all who could receive it and i would lord that many would benefit from this message i believe it's the best way to live and though man has made it into something that it's not there's still a life that's in it and it's virtuous and it's clean and it's pure and i would that anyone who could hear it and receive it could benefit from it lord bless us tonight as we're soon dismissed bless your people we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
