[0:00] at home I would say you have the comfort
[0:02] of your seats at home that's a joke when
[0:04] we say that because we have wooden pews
[0:07] and everybody knows exactly what is said
[0:09] about that I'm going to ask you to turn
[0:11] to 2 Samuel chapter
[0:13] 3 2 Samuel chapter 3 this may seem very
[0:17] unrelated but the Lord willing will'll
[0:21] let this unfold as as God would lead us
[0:24] this is in in verse 6 2 Samuel 3:6 and
[0:27] it came to pass while there was war
[0:29] between the House of Saul and the House
[0:31] of David that Abner made himself strong
[0:35] for the house of Saul and Saul had a
[0:38] concubine whose name was
[0:41] risah the daughter of aah and ishbosheth
[0:45] said to Abner so ishbosheth was the son
[0:48] of Saul that was reigning over Israel at
[0:50] that time and here's this woman but he
[0:53] says to Abner one of his leading
[0:55] generals and he said wherefore have you
[0:57] gone in unto my father's conc uine and
[1:01] then was Abner very wroth for the words
[1:03] of ishbosheth and said am I a dog's head
[1:07] which against Judah do show kindness
[1:09] this day unto the house of Saul thy
[1:12] father and to his Brethren and to his
[1:13] friends and have not delivered thee into
[1:16] the hand of David that thou charges me
[1:18] today with a fault concerning this woman
[1:23] so if I can take this example here's a
[1:26] woman and and if I'm going to just start
[1:28] to parallel this I'm going to actually
[1:30] call this service just for the sake of
[1:32] having a title that's different I'm
[1:33] going to call this risb
[1:36] supplications and and and we'll we'll
[1:39] we'll do it but I I want to take this if
[1:40] I can and I'll come back to this little
[1:43] portion of scripture after a bit but in
[1:45] the first reading in Matthew chapter 26
[1:48] we had a woman that was there who I will
[1:50] say grew up on the wrong side of the
[1:53] fence it was a woman who had no
[1:56] connection with religion had no
[1:57] connection no identification outwardly
[2:00] or in any way that she herself could
[2:02] connect and yet God is a God who does
[2:05] not work in just barriers in manmade uh
[2:08] if we can call it sectarianism man-made
[2:11] channels and and sometimes we ourselves
[2:14] box people into certain places but I've
[2:17] learned one thing about God God's a God
[2:19] that transcends all kinds of lines he
[2:23] moves Beyond he actually Delights in
[2:26] doing something beyond what we think and
[2:28] I like to leave room to do that I like
[2:31] to leave him room to to do something
[2:34] beyond what we think is the right thing
[2:35] to do it it was when when when Moses was
[2:39] there and he spoke those words and he
[2:41] says they're standing at the Red Sea and
[2:43] there's there's Egypt Army behind them
[2:46] the Red Sea in front of him he's trapped
[2:48] and he speaks by inspiration this day
[2:50] you'll see these Egyptians no more now
[2:53] now he had no idea what he was saying
[2:55] because when he got back to his
[2:56] intellect he's saying Lord what am I
[2:58] going to do and he says don't cry to me
[3:00] speak and he' already spoken but the
[3:03] outworking of it it could have been
[3:05] these days this Egyptians you'll see no
[3:06] more they could have gone home they
[3:08] could have done this but God had a plan
[3:10] where there was a sea going to open up
[3:12] they were going to go through the sea
[3:14] then the waters going to fall the
[3:16] outworking is God's it is not our
[3:19] outworking so I I like to leave room for
[3:21] God to do that now this woman here as we
[3:26] read with the alabaster box she'd come
[3:28] into a season she seemed to be on the
[3:30] wrong side but in her was something that
[3:34] Drew her to God it drew her to a place
[3:37] she may have misrepresented her life in
[3:40] what could have been a a mother what
[3:42] would could have been a real dear wife
[3:45] what could have been something it was
[3:46] misplaced but at the right season at the
[3:49] right time there was a place for her and
[3:52] God had that place for her and it
[3:54] manifested at Jesus Christ and it was a
[3:58] season where now God moved Upon A a
[4:01] vessel or a womb that was an
[4:04] uncharacteristically seemingly wrong
[4:06] choice but he moved on her because it
[4:09] was a season and she was a seed of God
[4:12] so now we find in Samuel here's another
[4:14] woman and she is a concubine out of the
[4:18] house of Saul now this is occurring just
[4:23] after Saul has passed away this is now
[4:26] occurring as David is coming into power
[4:29] and this woman this risah as she's known
[4:31] she is she is now in the house of Saul
[4:34] and the Bible would would tell us that
[4:36] the house of Saul was in Decline it was
[4:38] getting weaker and that the House of
[4:41] David was getting stronger and this
[4:43] woman was a woman who uh was seemingly a
[4:48] a concubine not even a wife was was on
[4:50] the wrong side of the fence and she
[4:53] became a catalyst a catalyst whereby now
[4:57] Abner and the Bible doesn't tell us if
[4:59] he went into to her and what motive he
[5:00] went into her with but he went into
[5:02] maybe to to get more Authority in the
[5:05] Kingdom uh over the king because this is
[5:07] a way of demonstrating that in those
[5:09] days but whatever it did it became the
[5:11] Catalyst where there became a separation
[5:14] between Saul's son who was the King and
[5:16] his leading general and that General
[5:18] went over to David's Camp so so this
[5:21] became a catalyst now I'm going to just
[5:24] back up a step and slow down cuz I feel
[5:27] like I'm moving too quickly I I I would
[5:29] like to just I want to be able for the
[5:31] Lord to minister to us and u i i i love
[5:35] brother Aaron Brother Aaron actually
[5:36] intimidates me sometimes because he's
[5:38] got such a sharp mind and he and he does
[5:40] that so I could preach his service for
[5:42] brother Aaron but I'm not going to try
[5:44] to impress him I am here to serve the
[5:47] Lord I am here to serve his people so
[5:50] I'm going to do that and so I I just
[5:52] spoke my complex out of
[5:58] existence anyway I love
[6:00] brother I whenever I call him I make
[6:02] sure I had two cups of coffee and I'm
[6:04] ready to meet the
[6:07] challenge I also learn to keep my wit
[6:10] about me with
[6:11] him now I'd like to make this relevant
[6:14] to where we are speaking of a woman
[6:16] today and that woman is the bride and a
[6:19] woman since the Fall In the Garden of
[6:21] Eden a woman has been seemingly as we
[6:24] would call it on not the footing that it
[6:27] all started out which was equal with
[6:30] but God is in the process of bringing
[6:32] the woman back into relationship back
[6:36] into the place where she is going to be
[6:39] the final voice where her actions will
[6:42] dictate to the enemy that caused all of
[6:44] this that that God is back in control
[6:48] and he has brought everything and
[6:49] restored it now it's amazing to me that
[6:53] a woman was the Target in the Garden of
[6:56] Eden and and and I I would look at it
[6:58] this way I believe if you go to serpent
[7:01] seed uh and I think maybe it's that
[7:03] message maybe it's another but Satan who
[7:06] had been kicked out of heaven now was on
[7:08] Earth and he watched God in creation and
[7:11] he always desired creation but yet he
[7:15] never was given that and in fact that's
[7:17] where iniquity was found on him he was
[7:19] not content to be what God made him now
[7:23] God's going to use a woman who is going
[7:25] to be content with what God made her to
[7:28] defeat him and he will never create but
[7:31] this woman that he caused to fall in the
[7:33] end she will in fact speak words that
[7:36] are creative not of herself but of the
[7:39] God who made her and so we want to yield
[7:41] oursel to God's program in the order
[7:44] that it's in so a woman if you can look
[7:47] at in the Garden of Eden she became and
[7:50] and and Satan had watched creation and
[7:52] now there was a period of time before
[7:54] the woman came forth and Satan would
[7:57] view that and he would look at this
[7:58] woman and he would say this woman now
[8:00] there's something out of order in
[8:02] creation here there's something and and
[8:05] he began to view her as a Target and he
[8:08] would embody himself in the serpent the
[8:11] closest thing to a human being that
[8:13] could mingle the seed and he began to
[8:15] Target that now God has also desired you
[8:18] and the enemy will watch you and he'll
[8:21] watch how the favor of God is maybe upon
[8:23] you how God will drop a handful in
[8:26] purpose for you how God will speak to
[8:28] you and you'll respond in a way that is
[8:30] beyond that the enemy sees that and as
[8:33] much as God desires you the enemy
[8:35] desires you now the enemy desires to
[8:39] have a part of you and God does now if
[8:41] if we take this in natural terms there's
[8:43] a little piece of land in the Middle
[8:45] East and it's amazing that out of all
[8:47] the land and the Earth today how
[8:49] everybody desires that piece of land and
[8:53] so Israel in the natural is where God's
[8:56] choice is been about a certain amount of
[8:58] Real Estate
[8:59] but it's also what Satan's after and we
[9:02] can take that as a type to what we are
[9:05] battling with in this last age now when
[9:09] Eve fell and I'll just refer quickly to
[9:11] this in Genesis chapter 3 and and and
[9:14] I'll just read from it if you don't
[9:16] follow to the scriptures that's fine but
[9:19] when Eve eventually fell so in Genesis 3
[9:23] verse1
[9:24] 15 uh it was God addressing the serpent
[9:27] and he says I will put
[9:29] enmity between thee and the woman and
[9:33] between thy seed and her seed and it
[9:37] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[9:40] bruise his heel so he's addressing the
[9:44] serpent and in in in in the message
[9:47] Joseph meeting his Brethren brother Ram
[9:49] would say this as soon as God seen the
[9:52] seed of the woman and how they had been
[9:55] mcre misconstrued there and
[9:57] righteousness had been perverted Ed God
[10:00] gave a promise that through that woman
[10:03] would come a blessed seed there would be
[10:07] a seed and he says and as soon as Satan
[10:10] heard that now listen there he's
[10:13] addressing the serpent but Satan was the
[10:15] one who had embodied that serpent he
[10:17] said as soon as Satan heard that who was
[10:20] standing Pro present as soon as he heard
[10:23] it he tried to destroy that seed and he
[10:25] tried to do it in Joseph he tried to do
[10:28] it all through the age and he's still
[10:31] against that blessed seed now in in in
[10:35] greatest battle ever fought brother B
[10:37] would say the battle that started in
[10:39] heaven came down to earth and it met at
[10:42] the grounds of the mind and it met in
[10:44] that woman and it's still the same today
[10:48] it's meeting in that but there's a
[10:50] difference this eve will not fall this
[10:52] eve will stand this eve has something
[10:55] about her and I don't I don't know if
[10:57] you found that there's times I thought I
[10:59] didn't have it but all of a sudden I
[11:00] find a little something out of the ashes
[11:02] that comes up and I say I cannot deny
[11:05] this I cannot stop what's inside of me
[11:07] God has determined something that is
[11:09] greater than me
[11:11] myself so he addresses the The Serpent
[11:14] and then in verse 16 he addresses to the
[11:16] woman and unto the woman he says I will
[11:19] greatly multiply your
[11:22] sorrow and your conception now
[11:25] associated with conception is sorrow but
[11:28] also associated with his joy and and
[11:31] there is something about that conception
[11:33] that is ingrained in a woman that even
[11:36] later in the scripture God would himself
[11:39] see that associated with that act with
[11:42] that something that came this life that
[11:45] comes out of her that remains in a woman
[11:47] right to the end Hey listen I had to go
[11:51] to the airport the other day and uh pick
[11:54] up my wife and we got this long distance
[11:56] between the pickup zone and where you go
[12:00] and I thought this is cold out what am I
[12:02] going to do so I drove up to the front
[12:03] gate and I said listen I got to go pick
[12:05] up a
[12:07] grandma and they said okay go ahead well
[12:11] my wife's a grandma right so second time
[12:13] now same with me right but I had to pick
[12:15] her up and she's a grandma but listen it
[12:17] only the picture only gets bigger she's
[12:20] a mother I mean she was leaving us for a
[12:22] few weeks and she said I'm so worried I
[12:24] says what are you worried about well
[12:26] you're going to be here all alone and
[12:27] Ethan and I said he's
[12:29] 21 I said I'm here I can take care of
[12:32] myself and even if I don't I can stand
[12:34] to lose a few pounds and so like like
[12:37] but it's ingrained in her you can't take
[12:39] it out of her and now that she's a
[12:41] grandma it's gone to another level you
[12:44] can't stop
[12:46] it hey associated with I'll multiply
[12:50] your sorrow and your conception yeah the
[12:52] multiplication is also associated with
[12:55] that that what God made her and now he
[12:58] goes goes on beyond that he says now in
[13:00] sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children
[13:02] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[13:04] and he shall rule over thee so so here a
[13:09] woman that is a will submit herself to
[13:12] the plan of God God will see to it that
[13:15] he brings about a finality to his
[13:17] Redemptive work now brother Adam would
[13:21] say in spoken words The Original seeve
[13:23] Seed Eve would have brought forth in
[13:26] other words she was the bedding ground
[13:28] she was what God was going to use and
[13:30] she would have eventually brought forth
[13:33] A Spoken Word children now how that was
[13:36] and how it all unfolds I don't know
[13:38] brother mam will say in invisible Union
[13:42] a woman is usted with certain characters
[13:46] she must not defile there's no creature
[13:49] on earth like a woman now a woman was in
[13:52] the beginning of creation because God
[13:54] knew she would fall and but he says I'll
[13:57] just go back to this I'm skipping a few
[13:58] things she has a sacred charge from God
[14:03] for Redemption right amen and it says it
[14:08] was God's great wisdom she was if she
[14:12] would have not been that way wouldn't
[14:14] dis complimentary to God's great wisdom
[14:17] she was made a byproduct of man her body
[14:21] is given to her a sacred Trust From God
[14:24] it's sacred she is to bring forth life
[14:27] into the Earth her body is the Bing
[14:30] grounds of life therefore the reason
[14:33] that she's given this trust so we're
[14:35] speaking about a woman natural but we
[14:38] also need to recognize that that we as a
[14:41] people are the spiritual part of Christ
[14:45] now as as I move this along and I'm I'm
[14:48] trying to hold back from not jumping
[14:50] ahead brother Brandon would say what a
[14:52] sacred trust to the woman but then he
[14:55] types it to the church she has the same
[14:58] resp responsibility a woman to
[15:01] Motherhood her virtues her husband the
[15:05] church a sacred responsibility to prayer
[15:09] and to the word and to Christ the same
[15:13] as the woman has now I know the battles
[15:18] that I have faced this year I have will
[15:21] have been 40 years that I've been
[15:22] serving the lord and and I look back and
[15:25] I look at what God did in the beginning
[15:27] and then I look at the challenges I
[15:29] faced and I look at where the enemy
[15:31] comes and where he seeks to defile where
[15:34] he seeks to just gain a foothold to do
[15:38] something and I'll tell you what it
[15:40] doesn't never stop because that's the
[15:42] enemy but there's also something when
[15:44] you're in love with the Lord when when
[15:47] it's not just rules and regulation no
[15:49] rules without relationship brings
[15:52] Rebellion but a relationship brings
[15:56] Faith brings love brings something that
[15:59] the that the enemy will never enter into
[16:03] and so what ought I say is Strive to
[16:05] keep that love strive to keep that
[16:07] relationship and it will keep you from
[16:09] doing things that the enemy would would
[16:11] in otherwise plant or gain a foothold in
[16:14] so this is the channel that God is
[16:17] Desiring to work in and this channel as
[16:21] as brother Brandon would speak in God's
[16:22] power to transform he says here he had
[16:25] brought forth everything on Earth put
[16:28] the seed in it with the power of life
[16:31] within it to transform it from a seed to
[16:34] a plant now if I can just and and I'm
[16:38] I'm skipping I'm just hitting some
[16:40] points but you know it was Admiral bird
[16:44] I believe it was he was he was the one
[16:46] who was traveling to the South Pole he
[16:48] had an expedition and he thought I'm
[16:51] going to bring along these cattle and
[16:53] these cattle are going to provide us
[16:54] fresh milk along the way on the journey
[16:57] and and back in those days they they
[16:59] would do it you know it would be whole
[17:00] milk it wouldn't be 2% half whatever it
[17:02] was it was whole milk and and but he
[17:04] brought them along and then they sewed
[17:07] these coats for these camels you say
[17:10] what are you saying this for but because
[17:12] he was trying to protect them but as
[17:14] they journeyed further north the
[17:16] inherent in the seed within these
[17:18] animals they began to grow out longer
[17:21] body hair and covering in fact they had
[17:23] no need of the coats because it was
[17:25] already within the seed the point I'm
[17:28] saying is the seed that's in US is a
[17:30] seed that transcends the fall it's a
[17:32] seed that transcends the conditions it's
[17:35] a seed that goes beyond anything we
[17:37] faced it it'll match the challenge in
[17:40] Luther's day it'll match the challenge
[17:42] in our day but it is God seed and it has
[17:45] these qualities within it and it is more
[17:48] than enough to meet the
[17:49] challenge and so that seed and and
[17:52] brother man would say it has a
[17:53] transforming power within God put the
[17:57] seed there with with potentials as long
[18:01] as it stayed in the right channel so
[18:04] I'll say if we can stay in the channel
[18:06] and maybe I this is really maybe as
[18:08] basic as the thought gets whatever your
[18:10] channel is stay in that
[18:13] channel if you're if you're a preacher
[18:15] be a preacher if you're a deacon be a
[18:17] deacon if you're a song leader stay a
[18:19] song
[18:20] leader all the all the preachers want to
[18:22] be singers and all the singers want to
[18:24] be
[18:26] preachers it's a joke around the around
[18:29] our place I I often say is the Lord
[18:31] reason the lord gave us so many good
[18:32] singers it's to overcome the preacher
[18:34] they have in their midst because the
[18:36] preacher is not a
[18:37] singer I've tried but it doesn't work so
[18:40] I just learn abide in your calling now
[18:43] it says earnestly desire the best gifts
[18:46] you know singers I think is one of the
[18:47] best gifts but nonetheless stay in your
[18:50] channel if you're a housewife stay in
[18:51] your channel God will bless you if you
[18:54] stay in the channel that God has has put
[18:56] you in let's we'll just come to that as
[18:58] we work along here a bit so now stay in
[19:02] that channel now if I go a little bit
[19:04] further I want to just take this a
[19:06] little bit on the thought of
[19:07] supplications and as much as a woman is
[19:12] subject he's got these characteristics
[19:14] she's inborn yet God takes these
[19:17] characteristics and he uses them I I I
[19:21] believe it was in in Hebrews chap 11 it
[19:24] would talk about Moses and Moses birth
[19:28] and and and and it starts out it doesn't
[19:30] mention his parents by name but brother
[19:32] Brandon mentions his parents and he
[19:34] talks about amram and josed and he talks
[19:36] about them but God used the
[19:40] characteristics of a mother of a mother
[19:44] who was not afraid of the king's
[19:46] commandment in other words the inside
[19:48] that woman even a fallen woman and the
[19:51] characteristics to be a bedding ground
[19:53] and to bring forth life and in that
[19:55] woman there was a faith that stood up in
[19:57] the great of the one in the face of one
[19:59] of the greatest persecutions that that
[20:02] woman would say I'm not afraid of the
[20:03] king's commandment I'm not going to give
[20:05] my son I'm going to hide my son even for
[20:08] three months and then he says I'll
[20:10] rather put him on on on a on a on a
[20:13] River Nile with crocodiles and I'll
[20:15] entrust him to
[20:17] God and the Bible would say by faith
[20:20] Moses when he was born he was hid three
[20:21] months of his parents because they saw
[20:24] he was a proper child and they were not
[20:26] afraid of the king's coming commandment
[20:28] so God uses a mother he uses a woman and
[20:32] it was a woman who no doubt was very
[20:34] careful about how she did these things
[20:37] listen God himself Likens his his
[20:41] remembrance of us as children to that of
[20:43] the faith of a mother he says a mother
[20:46] may forget her suckling child but I will
[20:48] never I will never forget you now we'll
[20:52] just drop back for a moment and I I'll
[20:54] just reference this is in in 1st Samuel
[20:57] chter 5
[20:58] and I'm I'm I'm just building to a few
[21:00] thoughts and dropping some things in
[21:02] along the way in in Simplicity this is
[21:06] the car I picked so we're we're going
[21:08] with
[21:09] it by the way it was a Volkswagen in the
[21:12] end in case anybody's
[21:14] looking 1 Samuel chap 1st Samuel chapter
[21:17] 1 let's just read this from verse 5 and
[21:20] this is maybe very familiar was talking
[21:22] about a man who had two two wives Hannah
[21:25] and panah and and if I could if I could
[21:28] characteristic this the story this way
[21:30] God knew where Israel was at God knew
[21:33] that Eli was coming to the end of his
[21:36] his priesthood he knew he had corrupt
[21:38] Sons now God had to bring forth what
[21:41] Israel needed was a prophet now he
[21:44] couldn't force a woman to say will you
[21:47] you know I want you to give up your
[21:48] child but God had to work according to
[21:51] the characteristics that were endowed in
[21:53] a woman and he had to bring her to a
[21:55] certain place where she would be willing
[21:58] to give her child unto the Lord so he
[22:00] creates these characteristics and here
[22:03] is this woman uh well Elana is the
[22:06] husband panah is the first wife in verse
[22:08] 5 but unto Hannah he gave a worthy
[22:11] portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord
[22:15] had shut up her womb now God held back
[22:19] you ever you ever ever God hold back on
[22:21] your promise you ever have him just why
[22:24] you know something you've had for years
[22:25] and years and years and and you know
[22:27] it's there you know it's coming but it's
[22:29] still not there and you might get
[22:31] frustrated you might do things but all
[22:33] along it's building you it's building
[22:35] some character it's building you to what
[22:37] you want I don't know what kind of
[22:39] character it's going to take to to have
[22:41] the power of the spoken word enacted in
[22:44] its time and in its season but I say it
[22:46] will be necessary and I'll say it will
[22:49] be God's work that will bring us to that
[22:52] place so he brings this woman to this
[22:54] place he shuts up her womb and her
[22:57] adversary provoked her sore to make her
[22:59] fret because the Lord had shut up her
[23:01] womb and as he did so year by year she
[23:04] went up to the house of the Lord and He
[23:05] provoked her for she provoked her now I
[23:08] don't know what she was doing to provoke
[23:10] her maybe it was a SN little remark
[23:12] maybe it was this or maybe it was just
[23:14] the fact that she had a child and the
[23:15] other one
[23:16] didn't and therefore she wept and did
[23:19] not eat now look at where this woman was
[23:21] coming to this is beyond the natural
[23:24] birth pains and Mourning sickness this
[23:27] is this is a spiritual
[23:30] groaning then said Al her husband Hannah
[23:33] why weepest thou and he said why don't
[23:35] you eat with me why is your heart
[23:36] grieved am I not better to you than 10
[23:38] Sons so Hannah rose up after they had
[23:41] eaten in Shiloh and after that she drunk
[23:43] and and and it goes down she comes she
[23:45] comes up into the temple Eli the pr the
[23:48] priest sat upon a seat by the post of
[23:51] the temple in the Lord and she was in
[23:55] bitterness of soul now if you actually
[23:59] look up prayer there's four types of
[24:00] prayers there's a prayer of adoration
[24:02] there's a prayer of Thanksgiving there's
[24:05] a prayer of petition where you have
[24:07] forgiveness where you have
[24:08] reconciliation confession and then
[24:10] there's a prayer of
[24:12] intercession and and many times
[24:14] intercession goes beyond Lord just bless
[24:17] me but there's times that the conditions
[24:20] are such that you begin to seek the Lord
[24:24] you begin to with a daily with a fervent
[24:28] within an ingrained something it becomes
[24:30] something greater than you yourself can
[24:32] even handle and it's called
[24:35] supplications and the and the Bible
[24:37] would say say it to us in in Ephesians 6
[24:40] praying always with all prayer and
[24:43] supplication in other words you wake up
[24:45] in the morning you go out Lord remember
[24:48] such and such remember so and so Lord on
[24:50] my heart it doesn't ever stop it's a
[24:52] groaning it's something within you and
[24:54] it says with every be careful for
[24:56] nothing Ephesians 4 Philip Philippians 4
[24:59] but in everything by prayer and
[25:02] supplication with Thanksgiving so in
[25:05] other words God is bringing something in
[25:07] Forth it's I think I think it was
[25:10] Charles Spurgeon they asked him one time
[25:12] they said what's more important is it
[25:15] reading the Bible or praying and he
[25:17] asked the question in return he says
[25:19] well what's more important breathing in
[25:20] or breathing out you need both you need
[25:25] both you you can read and so intellect
[25:27] ize the word and you can pray and you
[25:30] can pray in such a way that that all all
[25:32] you do is just yourself and your emotion
[25:34] that you're buried in but it takes the
[25:36] two together so all of these things have
[25:39] to come together and Timothy would say I
[25:42] exhort therefore that first of all
[25:46] supplications prayers intercessions
[25:49] giving of thanks be made for all men and
[25:53] I would talk about a widow uh you know
[25:55] that is a widow indeed trusting in God
[25:58] continuing in
[26:00] supplications I could go around this
[26:02] room and probably take a poll you know
[26:04] that there are prayers that you've been
[26:06] waiting on for years that have not come
[26:09] to fruition but it's a continual
[26:12] supplication it's a continual Thing
[26:14] Before the Throne of God you thank God
[26:16] for the things he's done you thank him
[26:18] for providing you you you praise him you
[26:21] love him you adore him but underneath
[26:22] all of that then comes but Lord remember
[26:24] so and so remember this situation we all
[26:27] have it right and yet the Bible tells of
[26:30] it so much so that in Hebrews it would
[26:32] tell even of the Lord Jesus in the days
[26:35] of his flesh when he offered up prayers
[26:39] and
[26:40] supplications our Lord did that with
[26:44] strong crying and tears unto him that
[26:46] was able to save him from Death now in
[26:50] may like I I'm putting this we're on
[26:52] this side and it may look like where is
[26:55] the Lord in my situation and it' be easy
[26:57] to get discouraged but I'll say this
[26:59] stay in that channel you don't know how
[27:02] it'll play out you don't know how it'll
[27:04] manifest you don't know how it'll do it
[27:06] and in fact I I I'll say right now I'm a
[27:09] product of a woman's
[27:11] supplications I had a mother that never
[27:13] stopped praying for me I had a mother
[27:16] that watched her son in the midst of a
[27:18] family that was broken that was
[27:19] separated and and and and two and two of
[27:22] her sons went out in the world and did
[27:24] all kinds of things and and here I was
[27:25] 2: am in the morning having a great time
[27:27] and a great party at a party and all of
[27:29] a sudden the party just
[27:31] stopped and I had nowhere to Nowhere
[27:33] left to go so I went home and I come in
[27:36] the house and here's my mom praying in
[27:37] the in the living room and she said I
[27:40] woke up at 2:00 and you weren't there I
[27:43] went on my knees and I started praying
[27:45] that was about the time the party broke
[27:47] up don't you think God hears yeah did he
[27:50] answer that prayer he answered that
[27:52] prayer did she stop praying she didn't
[27:53] stop praying and and and I say this to
[27:56] the glory of God I'm a product of a
[27:58] Praying Mother I I believe it's more
[28:00] than that but God had her there for a
[28:02] reason he placed a seene but he needed
[28:04] something to help along the way and God
[28:07] put something in a in in Susanna Wesley
[28:09] he put something in grandmothers and
[28:11] mothers and and he put it there for a
[28:13] reason and he put it in the church
[28:16] friends let's not stop let's stay before
[28:19] God don't ever grow weary and well-doing
[28:22] God has placed these things there and
[28:25] they're necessary here's Hannah
[28:28] in bitterness of Soul verse 10 and she
[28:31] prays to the Lord and it's in this most
[28:35] desperate
[28:36] time now look look at what it brought
[28:38] her to she vowed a vow oh and said oh
[28:41] lord of hosts if you will indeed look
[28:43] upon the Affliction of thine handmade
[28:45] and remember me and not forget thine
[28:47] handmade but will give thine handmade
[28:50] not just a child but a
[28:53] Manchild why because a Manchild as
[28:57] especially as a firstborn that was going
[28:59] to be an heir that was going to be the
[29:01] one that God required then if you do
[29:04] that Lord I'll give him to you now this
[29:06] is a free will offering but look at the
[29:09] conditions that bore this offering look
[29:12] at what the garden of eat God will not
[29:14] force you but he will draw out of you
[29:17] the very thing that he's Desiring to
[29:19] bring out of you amen and he says here
[29:21] she was he says I'll I'll give him to
[29:24] the Lord all the days of his life and
[29:25] there'll be no razor com upon his head
[29:27] now we know the rest of the story we
[29:30] know that Samuel was born we know that
[29:31] he became the prophet of Israel one of
[29:33] the great prophets in the bible but look
[29:35] at how that was
[29:37] born and I say that that's that's that's
[29:40] a channel that we ought to be in brother
[29:42] Brandon would say this in in a message
[29:44] and you'd say God has a program and he
[29:48] will set you and place you in Christ
[29:50] where he thinks it will work best for
[29:52] him just stay in your calling don't try
[29:57] to get yet somebody else's calling stay
[29:58] in your calling if you're a housewife
[30:01] remain a
[30:02] housewife whatever God has called you to
[30:04] do just remain there he knows where and
[30:07] how to put his hand on you and use you
[30:10] and then he says he had a little old
[30:12] woman named Hannah one time a housewife
[30:16] he knowed where to place her and he
[30:18] knowed what he was going to do with
[30:20] her I think that's wonderful he had one
[30:22] named Mary just be humble submit
[30:26] yourself to him and walk on now I've got
[30:30] to move this along a little bit just to
[30:32] to stay in in in line with the scripture
[30:35] the scriptures I want to get
[30:37] to let's just where are we at
[30:40] intercessory let's just go to Matthew 15
[30:43] for a
[30:44] moment this this is also a familiar
[30:48] portion but I I I find it amazing how
[30:51] God would
[30:54] utilize a a woman and the characteristic
[30:57] I and I'm I'm focusing on that a little
[30:59] bit in terms of the Bride
[31:01] but this is in verse 21 Matthew 15:
[31:05] 21 and Jesus went then and departed at
[31:08] the coast of tyon and sidon and behold a
[31:10] woman of Canaan came out of the same
[31:11] coast and cried to him saying have mercy
[31:14] on me oh Lord thou son of David my
[31:17] daughter is grievously vexed with the
[31:21] devil now this was a real legitimate
[31:24] complaint a real legitimate need but
[31:27] it's a woman who is on the wrong side of
[31:29] the
[31:30] fence she she approaches him and and
[31:32] there's many aspects to this story in
[31:34] brother bam will bring him and and she
[31:36] approaches him as oh Lord as son of
[31:38] David which was the wrong approach
[31:41] literally it was the wrong approach and
[31:44] he never answered her a word and the
[31:47] disciples came and besought her send her
[31:48] away she's crying after us this woman
[31:51] will not stop why she was a woman who
[31:54] had a daughter and had a need and by
[31:57] nature she was going along with the way
[31:59] she
[32:00] was listen the Bible is filled with
[32:03] these David David had a close friend
[32:06] Jonathan who was of the House of Saul
[32:08] and David said the love that he had with
[32:10] Jonathan surpassed the love of anything
[32:12] on the world he says God had put them
[32:15] together and it was David who years
[32:18] later even after Saul and Jonathan died
[32:20] he sought out Jonathan's son that he
[32:22] might do good for him even though he was
[32:25] on the wrong side of the fence the love
[32:27] of God will transcend a lot of things
[32:29] don't put people in a box and I'll say
[32:32] this the enemy wants to put people in a
[32:34] box but you stay with what God puts in
[32:36] your heart when you kneel in prayer hey
[32:39] oh they Fellowship across town that has
[32:41] nothing to do with it just be faithful
[32:43] be who you are and let God deal with the
[32:47] rest he goes on to say he answered
[32:50] another word and she answered and said
[32:52] I'm not sent but to the lost sheep of
[32:54] the House of Israel now look at this
[32:56] response this is
[32:57] Beyond then she then came she and
[33:01] worshiped him Lord help
[33:05] me that turned
[33:08] him listen Friends when the Seven Seals
[33:10] opened what followed that opening
[33:14] worship worship followed it whatever you
[33:17] do thank God worship him for because
[33:20] listen something is opened that cannot
[33:22] be changed something's opened that the
[33:25] devil can never get his hands on
[33:27] something's open we may not have come to
[33:29] it but start thanking for it start
[33:32] thanking him for it and he says
[33:35] now I I'm not I'm not and he answered
[33:38] it's not meat for me to take the
[33:40] children's bed and to cast it to dogs
[33:42] now this the spirit the level that this
[33:45] woman got to I'll tell you what it was
[33:47] not just showing up at a church service
[33:50] this was something that was heavily born
[33:52] and deep within her and she says that's
[33:55] the truth Lord
[33:57] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[33:59] fall from their master's table and the
[34:01] Jesus said oh woman Great Is Thy
[34:03] Faithfulness be it unto thee even as
[34:06] thou Wilt and her daughter was made
[34:08] whole from that very
[34:11] hour look at who who orchestrated this
[34:16] God allowed these circumstances to bring
[34:18] out the nature of a true seed and to
[34:21] bring it right before him and at the
[34:24] appropriate hour there was such a great
[34:26] Deliverance
[34:27] I think this is
[34:28] marvelous there's so many things I could
[34:30] take of the Bible but brother banam
[34:32] would would talk you know he said one of
[34:35] the most important messages that he ever
[34:37] spoke was the token and then that
[34:40] evening as he's coming he speaks this is
[34:42] the message that's needed to follow the
[34:46] token the enemy will reduce the message
[34:49] to superficial he'll reduce it to just
[34:52] skimming quotes to just reading things
[34:55] but I'll say when you actually get into
[34:57] relationship and and you're in church
[34:59] and and it's not just the minister who's
[35:01] working for you but you see the Lord
[35:04] working behind the scenes when you
[35:06] recognize that the prophet is not just
[35:07] quotes I'm going to paste on the wall
[35:09] but that's my Lord speaking there that's
[35:12] him speaking to me personally in this
[35:14] generation this age and my
[35:16] identification is in that it's not just
[35:19] in the messenger it's not just in elazar
[35:21] but it's in my Lord who's behind all of
[35:23] that and when that comes I'll tell you
[35:25] what that brings a reality
[35:27] [Music]
[35:28] and so desperation brother man said we
[35:30] are on the verge of one of the mightiest
[35:32] things that's ever struck the struck the
[35:35] Earth since the days of the Lord Jesus
[35:38] see see now it'll be so
[35:42] humble see what what man calls Mighty
[35:45] God calls an Abomination what God what
[35:48] man calls foolish God calls Mighty now
[35:50] watch it it'll be so humble that you'll
[35:53] miss it if you don't have the token
[35:56] there to examine it I see a lot of
[36:00] promises in the Bible but they are not
[36:03] independent and I'll say in this last
[36:05] stage they are not independent of Our
[36:08] Lord in fact every one of our promises
[36:10] the bride's promises are because of our
[36:13] lord it's not that I'm going to pick out
[36:15] this part of the message and I'll run
[36:17] with that or I'll pick out this part and
[36:18] run with it no it's part of the package
[36:21] and I want the whole package I don't I
[36:23] don't want just my take on it or my
[36:25] stick on it or whatever it is I want the
[36:27] whole package I'll surrender to the
[36:29] whole thing and I believe that's where
[36:31] God wants us to
[36:33] be
[36:35] now he says this
[36:38] also he says the reason reason tonight
[36:42] that there are many things that that
[36:45] well I'll just I'll just summarize it he
[36:47] says the reason we are not desperate
[36:48] enough is a lack of love the enemy will
[36:51] try to bring us into a lukewarm formal
[36:53] condition and listen he does it tries to
[36:55] do it to me but I thank God that he
[36:58] shakes me up every once in a while I
[37:00] thank God that it's not just I I I want
[37:03] I want to be shook up now before it's
[37:06] somewhere down the road I I would say
[37:07] Lord bring me into that
[37:09] channel now I need to move this along
[37:11] let's go over to let's go over to
[37:14] Genesis
[37:16] 15 I'm really getting to the Crux of
[37:18] where I want to get to now and and we'll
[37:20] just take it this way Genesis chapter
[37:22] 15 now this is Abraham and uh you know
[37:26] one thing I find about
[37:28] Abraham is there was something in
[37:30] Abraham's life that stayed with him and
[37:33] and and and you you can look at several
[37:34] aspects of Abraham's life but it was his
[37:37] attitude towards the sacrifice it was
[37:40] his attitude when God told him in
[37:42] Genesis 12 to leave and then at a
[37:44] certain place he had a sacrifice and it
[37:46] was so noteworthy that even the Heathen
[37:48] would notice others would notice but a
[37:50] he had something about the sacrifice
[37:52] because God was leading him up to
[37:54] Genesis 22 where he was was going to
[37:57] offer his own son as a sacrifice and and
[38:00] at the end of the day I I'll say it this
[38:01] way Revelations 12 how is the bride
[38:04] going to overcome they overcome by the
[38:06] word of their testimony they overcome by
[38:08] the blood of the lamb and they also
[38:10] overcome because they love not their
[38:12] lives unto death there's a channel that
[38:14] you've got to enter into to come to a
[38:17] fullness amen now Abraham this
[38:20] exemplified through his life so we're
[38:21] going to pick up this in Genesis 15 and
[38:23] verse 6 and he says he believed in the
[38:25] Lord and He count to him for
[38:27] righteousness and here God's rehearsing
[38:29] the promise to him said I am the Lord
[38:31] that brought thee out of er of the
[38:32] chales to give thee this land to inherit
[38:34] it now look at look at where he's
[38:36] talking he's talking about the
[38:37] inheritance now he says Lord God whereby
[38:40] shall I know that I shall inherit it so
[38:44] he's talking about the inheritance he
[38:46] says now okay this is what you do take a
[38:48] heer of three years old a goat of three
[38:50] years old a ram of 3 years old and a
[38:52] turtle dove and a young pigeon and he
[38:54] took them all and he divided them in the
[38:56] midst and he laid each piece one against
[38:59] the other but the birds he divided not
[39:00] so I'm not going to focus on the order
[39:02] of these events and what they do but I
[39:04] want to take a look at Abraham's
[39:06] attitude regarding the
[39:09] sacrifice and I say we all are obligated
[39:12] to give something so now as the
[39:14] sacrifice is there what happens he's
[39:16] given the sacrifice maybe it's midday
[39:19] but about the evening time in the next
[39:21] verse you can take it he says now he's
[39:23] divided them and when the fowls came the
[39:25] birds those things around the Earth they
[39:27] came to descend upon his sacrifice it
[39:29] was Abraham's duty to beat them off
[39:33] friends the the message we have don't
[39:34] think for a moment that when you make
[39:36] your house a home that the enem is going
[39:38] to leave you but you got to beat it off
[39:40] you've got to protect that sacrifice I
[39:43] don't know if I I took the quote but
[39:44] brother bam would say in one place he
[39:46] said he knew what Abraham would do and
[39:49] he knew how Abraham would treat
[39:52] that listen God knew that when lot was
[39:56] would
[39:57] sin Abraham would go after
[40:00] him he also knew that when the king of
[40:02] Sodom came at the end and said Abraham
[40:04] you've rescued us all he also knew there
[40:06] was something in Abraham that said I
[40:08] will not even take the thread or a sho
[40:10] latchet from you and in the same breath
[40:13] he would turn and here is MDC and
[40:16] Abraham says I'll give you a tenth what
[40:19] was it doing it was exemplifying
[40:21] something that was a characteristic of
[40:23] the seed that was within him and it
[40:25] began to show in real life
[40:31] situations there there there's a
[40:33] testimony I I'd give of my wife I don't

[42:55] the camp meeting all right my daughter
[42:57] was really grieved because they missed
[42:58] the shopping trip they' planned along
[42:59] the way but
[43:05] but one brother said one time he says
[43:09] the reason woman women love shopping is
[43:12] because they're a
[43:13] byproduct when when they see a product
[43:16] they like to buy
[43:17] it
[43:18] listen they made it to the camp this guy
[43:22] calls me the next day says did your
[43:23] daughter and your your your wife make it

[43:45] mail and the man says I saw that your
[43:47] daughter needed your wife needed help
[43:50] and therefore I paid her here's my story
[43:53] I'm a single parent I've got three
[43:55] children maybe one day somewhere they're
[43:58] going to need some help and I pray that
[44:00] the same God that allowed me to help
[44:02] your wife will help them do you want to
[44:04] know how the program of God works
[44:06] there's a man maybe never in the message
[44:08] NE anywhere but on the day of judgment I
[44:11] assure you when he stands up and I come
[44:13] there and I say does anything any have
[44:15] something to say about this man yeah he
[44:17] helped my wife in a time of need okay
[44:19] sir you helped one of my daughters come
[44:21] in to eternal life you don't think it
[44:24] makes a difference how we conduct our
[44:26] Affairs and how we do things it surely
[44:29] does it's God's
[44:31] grace I opened the door to that story
[44:34] and now I got to go back to where I was
[44:35] and I don't quite
[44:36] remember here's
[44:40] Abraham and these birds are
[44:42] coming and God
[44:44] says this about our
[44:47] sacrifice God confirmed his Covenant
[44:50] right there but now he gives Abraham his
[44:52] part brother keep the vultures off of it
[44:56] keep the old worldly Hollywood vultures
[45:00] out of the Pentecostal Church keep them
[45:02] away from our women and you with all
[45:05] these big silly jokes and things let
[45:07] them have it that's their Kingdom we're
[45:09] not of this world and he would go on to
[45:12] say he said he took those animals what
[45:14] is this a type of and Abraham beating
[45:16] them away that's a type in this last
[45:19] days casting out Devils from the
[45:21] sacrifice God promised the sacrifice
[45:24] them unbelieving spirits are trying to
[45:26] devour it but that man of God casting
[45:29] the Devils away from it confirming the
[45:31] Covenant and he says so must the seed of
[45:34] God stand in these last days now this is
[45:37] a type this is a wonderful type I really
[45:39] got to move along how are we doing
[45:42] here okay
[45:47] let's Abraham's attitude I I just if I
[45:50] can pick that up let's go back to if we
[45:53] can to 1 2 Samuel chap 3
[45:56] this will be one of our opening
[46:03] scriptures brother Aaron asked me for
[46:05] the title this afternoon if I would have
[46:07] told him Reba's supplications he would
[46:10] have spent all afternoon searching it
[46:12] out he probably didn't doesn't care he
[46:15] wanted to wait for the service good for
[46:16] you God bless you real
[46:19] time if you take the context of what we
[46:22] read 2 Samuel chap 2:3 there was a long
[46:26] war between the house of Saul and the
[46:27] House of David but David waxed stronger
[46:30] and stronger and the house of Saul waxed
[46:31] weaker and weaker now here's David David
[46:34] has just heard the report of Saul
[46:37] passing away he weeps and he cries for
[46:40] David and and Jonathan or for Saul and
[46:43] Jonathan and then a messenger comes and
[46:45] says I'm the one who killed him and it
[46:46] was just to get David's attention and
[46:49] David shows his colors and he says no he
[46:51] says you touch God's anointed you'll pay
[46:54] with your life and he never did' touch
[46:56] God's anointed but yet he paid for his
[46:57] with his life so here's here's David
[47:01] ascending to the king ascending to the
[47:03] be the kingdom now God leads him to be
[47:05] the king over Judah so he dwells and he
[47:08] goes up to Hebron and he dwells at
[47:10] Hebron for 7even years and six months
[47:13] and while he's there this is where this
[47:15] scripture starts to go now it says unto
[47:18] David were born were Sons born in Hebron
[47:21] the first was
[47:23] amnon of anahi and the second was so he
[47:26] here's the sons of David that were born
[47:28] you can follow the through the first was
[47:30] amnon the second was chileab if that's
[47:33] the correct way of saying it the next
[47:34] was Absalon the fourth was adonijah and
[47:37] then the fifth was Shep paaya and the
[47:41] sixth itham six Sons born to David six
[47:46] Sons born of David's wives but the
[47:49] seventh one that was mentioned the
[47:50] seventh woman mentioned was
[47:53] risah of the wrong side of the lineage
[47:55] of the wrong side of the fence if we can
[47:57] call it but yet she was in a place and
[48:00] she didn't even know what was ahead for
[48:02] her but this is the background to where
[48:05] she came from now this is part of the
[48:08] Ascension of David to the kingdom let's
[48:10] just take this over to 2 Samuel chapter
[48:14] 21 2 Samuel chapter
[48:20] 21 verse one then there was a famine in
[48:23] the days of David 3 years year after
[48:25] Year and David inquired of the Lord and
[48:29] the Lord answered it is for Saul and for
[48:32] his bloody house because he slew the
[48:35] gibit so if you catch the big picture
[48:38] there's a famine that strikes Israel
[48:41] natural events and David the king says
[48:44] Lord why is this so it's because of Saul
[48:48] and what he did to the gibeonites and if
[48:50] you remember the gibeonites they were
[48:52] the ones who came in by deceit to Joshua
[48:55] and said said we have come from a long
[48:57] way off they dressed with old clothes
[48:59] they saved their moldy bread they saved
[49:01] all these things and they deceived
[49:02] Joshua but they were brought into the
[49:05] Covenant and as they were brought into
[49:07] the Covenant they always had a place
[49:09] they became the hewers for Israel but
[49:12] God remembered them so much so that many
[49:15] years down the road when Saul slew them
[49:19] God held it against
[49:21] Israel now God remembers everything and
[49:26] I believe God is a God not only of the
[49:27] Bride but God is a god of the foolish
[49:29] virgin God is a god of of if I can call
[49:32] it uh Israel God is a god of even those
[49:35] that are good to the bride but look at
[49:37] the place that God has placed us look at
[49:40] the place we have in the economy of God
[49:42] I don't have time to get into Daniel
[49:44] chapter 7 but the books were opened and
[49:46] and another book was opened and there
[49:48] was thousands that ministered and tens
[49:50] of thousands the thousands that
[49:52] ministered were the bride there was
[49:55] something that they were doing they were
[49:56] giving him a
[49:58] service now
[50:00] here David when he hears God's judgment
[50:03] and why all of this is coming he calls
[50:06] the gibeonites and he said to them now
[50:08] the gibeonites were not of the children
[50:09] of Israel but the remnant of the
[50:11] amorites and the children of Israel had
[50:13] sworn to them and Saul sought to slay
[50:15] them in his Zeal to the children of
[50:17] Israel in Judah therefore David said to
[50:19] the gibeonites he says now this is
[50:22] what's happening what shall I do with
[50:25] for you how can I make atonement that
[50:28] you may bless the inheritance of the
[50:32] Lord now if you go back what what
[50:35] Abraham did in Genesis 15 whereby shall
[50:38] I know that I may inherit it now friends
[50:42] we are coming into our inheritance and
[50:44] God had typed out the inheritance in the
[50:46] land first in the mothers who growned
[50:49] and when they groaned they groan the
[50:51] name of their children and it related to
[50:54] a position in the land now there's a
[50:57] groaning at the time of the birth
[50:58] there's a groaning now here at the time
[51:00] of The Inheritance and he and he says
[51:02] the gibat said to David we have no
[51:04] silver or gold of Saul or of his house
[51:08] neither for us shalt thou kill any man
[51:10] in Israel and he said what shall you say
[51:12] that I shall do for you and they
[51:13] answered the king the man that consumed
[51:15] us and devised against us which was Saul
[51:18] that we should be destroyed from
[51:20] remaining in the coast let seven men of
[51:22] his sons be delivered unto us and we
[51:25] will hang them up in the L unto the Lord
[51:28] in giba of Saul whom the Lord did choose
[51:32] now he's saying here's the retribution
[51:33] give us seven sons and he says of those
[51:36] seven sons hang their heads and he says
[51:38] and the King you can choose them I'll
[51:40] give them so the king first of all he
[51:42] spares mephibosheth which was the son of
[51:45] Jonathan of Saul because of the Lord's
[51:47] oath that was between them between David
[51:49] and Jonathan but here's here's this
[51:51] woman coming into view but the king took
[51:53] two sons of RBA the daughter of a whom
[51:56] she bear unto Saul Armon and meib and
[52:00] five sons of Michael the daughter of
[52:02] Saul whom she brought up for Adriel the
[52:05] son of barcelia theh halite so he takes
[52:08] two sons of risah and five sons of
[52:11] Michael and he says and he delivered
[52:13] them to the hands of the G gibeonites
[52:15] they hung them in the hill all seven
[52:17] together they were put to death in the
[52:19] days of the Harvest in the first days in
[52:21] the beginning of the Harvest now just go
[52:24] back to what Abraham did and now watch
[52:26] what's happening here and risah the
[52:29] daughter of AI took sackcloth and spread
[52:32] it for her upon the rock from the
[52:35] beginning of the Harvest until water
[52:38] dropped upon them out of heaven and she
[52:40] suffered neither the birds of the air to
[52:43] rest on them by day nor the beasts of
[52:46] the field by night this is amazing to me
[52:48] this is not a one day thing this is from
[52:50] the beginning of the Harvest until rain
[52:53] came and the reason rain was being
[52:56] withheld was because of the very
[52:58] sacrifice she had been forced to
[53:01] give but she was a mother and she stayed
[53:04] in her Channel and that which she gave
[53:07] forth was her sons and she couldn't bear
[53:10] to see them put to shame to be eaten up
[53:13] by the birds or the animals of the field
[53:15] and she stays there continually now if
[53:17] you go back to the original part of this
[53:19] whole promise if I can inject this what
[53:22] God told uh King David was the curse is
[53:25] because of what Saul did and then he
[53:27] asked the gibon ites they said let these
[53:29] men now really the curse should have
[53:31] been
[53:32] lifted but it wasn't it still stayed
[53:36] there I I'm I'm going to drop this in
[53:39] because this is beautiful to me but you
[53:40] know what we're living in a Time friends
[53:43] as I said God transcends
[53:45] lines David was the king but as a king
[53:50] in the battle on the way he ate the
[53:53] showbread that was reserved for the
[53:54] priest
[53:56] and God never rebuked him for it in fact
[54:00] Israel was to be priest but we as a
[54:02] bride are to be Kings and Priests we are
[54:05] not just reserved a special place but we
[54:08] begin to transcend we begin to go beyond
[54:11] Jesus did this when he came on Earth we
[54:13] as a bride we begin to step out ahead of
[54:16] time exercising our power on who we are
[54:19] and we do it not by party lines but we
[54:21] do it by Nature that we love the Lord
[54:24] and we do a ser for him and I'll do
[54:26] whatever it takes so here's
[54:29] risah the curse should have been lifted
[54:32] But Here by Nature she comes and she
[54:34] can't bear to see her sons they're
[54:36] sacrificed they're dead and she she
[54:38] can't do anything about it she's just a
[54:40] concubine from the house of Saul she
[54:42] can't even appeal to David all she can
[54:44] appeal to is her nature as a mother and
[54:46] as a nature as a mother she doesn't
[54:48] allow these
[54:49] animals and here's David up in the Kings
[54:53] I I I I say it this way friends
[54:55] we're on Earth God is in heaven but
[54:59] there's something happening there's a
[55:00] connection that's happening under the
[55:02] seven seal there was silence in heaven
[55:04] but there was things happening on Earth
[55:06] that I believe God is beginning to act
[55:09] on don't think for a moment your
[55:11] supplications that which you're doing
[55:13] there's something you're doing and I'll
[55:15] say this God there there's there's a
[55:18] there's a connection if we can see
[55:21] it and it says in verse 11 and it was
[55:23] told David what risah the daughter of AI
[55:27] the concubine of Saul had done now I
[55:30] don't know what was going on in David's
[55:31] mind he's going what is this woman doing
[55:34] she's there day and night day beating
[55:36] these things off why is she doing that
[55:40] and all of a sudden it triggers in
[55:41] David's
[55:42] mind there's something she's doing and
[55:45] look at the next move David makes and
[55:48] David went and he took the bones of Saul
[55:51] and the bones of Jonathan his son from
[55:54] the men of jath Gilead who had stolen
[55:56] from the street of Bashan where the
[55:58] Philistines had hung him and the
[56:00] Philistines had slain Saul in Gilbo so
[56:03] Saul and d and Jonathan met their end in
[56:07] a Philistine country they were buried
[56:10] there and they weren't in their rightful
[56:13] place and God who is a God your name
[56:17] cannot be taken away from the place in
[56:19] the land you can never be dis taken away
[56:21] from The Inheritance that God has
[56:23] purchased you through Jesus Christ and
[56:26] here here's David sees this and he takes
[56:29] in verse 14 and the bones of Sol and
[56:31] Jonathan his son were buried in the
[56:34] country of Benjamin in zelah in the
[56:36] separer of kish's father and they
[56:38] performed All the King's Command so the
[56:41] king says put them back in their place
[56:43] get them in Benjamin get them in their
[56:45] inheritance and the next verse says and
[56:48] after that God was intreated for the
[56:50] land now who was the Catalyst behind all
[56:53] of this was a woman who was just
[56:56] performing her act performing a a duty
[56:58] by nature and it moved the king's heart
[57:03] don't think friends for a moment God
[57:05] doesn't see your righteous life your
[57:08] your groanings your utterings that which
[57:10] you're doing and you don't know the
[57:12] moment that what you do what you're
[57:14] playing out by God by the nature he put
[57:16] in you is having an effect in heaven you
[57:19] don't know when God will move on the
[57:21] scene you don't know when he'll do
[57:23] something I I I I I'll share this for a
[57:26] moment I told you my mother prayed for
[57:29] me my mother God bless her I had a
[57:33] wonderful grandmother I had a wonderful
[57:34] mother I feel like Timothy Timothy who
[57:38] Paul would say you're the faith I saw in
[57:41] your grandmother and your mother I see
[57:42] in you I thought this is a wonderful
[57:43] type and then I start going through
[57:45] trials and hard things I go okay I don't
[57:47] know if I like this
[57:51] type my
[57:53] mother made made it through a war the
[57:56] eldest daughter watched over her
[57:59] siblings came through second world war
[58:03] made her way to Canada the first of our
[58:05] family worked and labored she's 91 years
[58:08] old she prayed she was in the midst of a
[58:12] uh a relationship with my father who
[58:14] when they came together was not in the
[58:16] message or the banner of the message was
[58:17] in the Baptist Church came together but
[58:20] found out there was all kinds of demonic
[58:22] influences and religious spirits and and
[58:24] at very early age it began to be a
[58:26] tension in the home and in 1963 my M my
[58:29] grand my mother wrote brother brandham
[58:32] and said I need your prayer for my
[58:35] husband and I was already born then my
[58:37] my brother was born my daughter my
[58:39] sister wasn't born and she wrote and
[58:41] brother brandham wrote her back I pray
[58:43] that the Lord would set him free of the
[58:46] evil spirits and that you would be happy
[58:49] together the first night she put the
[58:51] prayer cloth under my father's pillow
[58:52] demon Spirits attacked her that night
[58:55] she never stopped praying in fact the
[58:58] situation got worse situation my father
[59:01] got worse years later he divorced her
[59:03] all kinds of accusations against her my
[59:06] father did all kinds of things and I
[59:07] can't even go into the depth and the
[59:09] detail of it all but she never stopped
[59:11] and she kept praying and she kept
[59:13] praying and 10 years went by and 20
[59:16] years went by and 30 years and he'd
[59:17] moved out to Vancouver Isle and did all
[59:19] kinds of things and and finally came
[59:21] back home he had alien himself from the
[59:22] whole family but she never stopped and
[59:26] here's the point even for me he saw what
[59:29] God did in my life I was the eldest I
[59:31] never was able to preach to him but what
[59:33] I was able to do was stay in the channel
[59:36] of a father to a son and I stayed in
[59:39] that relationship but God God made it
[59:40] real to me honor your father and mother
[59:43] and even though there wasn't much to
[59:45] respect or much to honor I stayed in
[59:46] that channel and in the end now and I
[59:49] remember it well brother Aaron it was a
[59:50] time sister Allison do passed away and
[59:53] and we had the funeral up in Grand
[59:55] Prairie and by the way that was a
[59:56] wonderful service you ministered on the
[59:57] Sunday and and and I came back and my
[1:00:00] father had collapsed in his apartment
[1:00:03] had been laying dormant in there for 36
[1:00:05] hours his body temperature had gone down
[1:00:07] to nothing and he was taken by Hospital
[1:00:09] the ambulance he had an infection he had
[1:00:11] cancer and and it didn't look like he
[1:00:13] was going to make it his mind was gone
[1:00:15] and all kinds of things and and and for
[1:00:16] the first time I maybe offered prayer at
[1:00:18] the church I let them know two days
[1:00:21] later I go to the hospital and here's my
[1:00:23] father clear as a bell and he says Ed
[1:00:26] you're still here he says you've been a
[1:00:28] better son than I've ever been a father
[1:00:31] the atmosphere that happened at that
[1:00:32] time I can't even say it my mother and I
[1:00:35] went to the apartment where he was there
[1:00:36] was blood there was feces there was
[1:00:38] vomit all over the floor and I just said
[1:00:40] Lord no matter what he's done be
[1:00:43] merciful to him it was it was a love of
[1:00:46] God beyond what I could share but here
[1:00:48] was a mom that was praying and and and
[1:00:51] we came to the conclusion we did all of
[1:00:53] that and I came to the hospital at that
[1:00:55] time and all religious walls dropped and
[1:00:58] he began to open up and share things and
[1:01:00] say things and and he even told me the
[1:01:02] things you're preaching I don't
[1:01:03] understand it but you're doing the right
[1:01:05] thing just keep doing it and he would
[1:01:07] tell me he says I may not live for
[1:01:09] another thousand years but I know
[1:01:10] there's something for me on the other
[1:01:12] side I say what was it the supplications
[1:01:15] of a woman the supplications of God in a
[1:01:18] woman my brother and sister came from
[1:01:20] British Columbia we were there having
[1:01:21] lunch and they were alienated from my
[1:01:23] father and they were just kind of
[1:01:24] railing on the whole thing and why do we
[1:01:26] have to take care of them now and and I
[1:01:28] just said to them I said look at your
[1:01:29] mom almost 50 years she's waited for a
[1:01:33] promise and I said here she's still
[1:01:35] standing I said that's not a woman
[1:01:37] that's God in a
[1:01:38] woman and I watched God even do a work
[1:01:41] in my brother I watching those things it
[1:01:43] was tremendous and I'll say this by the
[1:01:45] grace of God I'll see my father
[1:01:47] again now he may not be a part of the
[1:01:50] Bride but that's listen if God can do
[1:01:52] that what can he do with our attitude
[1:01:56] towards our sacrifice what of our
[1:01:58] supplications listen this is Wednesday
[1:02:00] I'm going to stop there but I thank you
[1:02:02] for for just bearing with me I'll say
[1:02:04] this don't ever give up let me let me
[1:02:06] let me say this in conclusion stay in
[1:02:09] the channel that God has put you in I I
[1:02:12] think it
[1:02:13] was Florence sharan brother brandham
[1:02:16] would say she came to him and she said
[1:02:18] brother brandom she says I fast and Fast
[1:02:21] and pray but I still can't cast out
[1:02:24] devils and he says you weren't born to
[1:02:27] do such your duty is to fast the holy
[1:02:31] spirit is working on somebody else to
[1:02:34] car cast out Devils you don't know that
[1:02:37] place oh he said I wish you could catch
[1:02:40] that one person is burdened for this
[1:02:42] another one over there you don't know
[1:02:44] what to do you're just submissive to
[1:02:46] your call and it'll always line up with
[1:02:49] the scripture I believe if we could all
[1:02:51] work in harmony that way in a body what
[1:02:54] kind of of a body could this be now let
[1:02:56] me just take this this to my be my final
[1:02:58] two quotes but he says this he says now
[1:03:01] he saw your name before the foundation
[1:03:03] of the world he saw the deceitfulness of
[1:03:05] Satan in other words the great overrider
[1:03:08] he put a seed in you that he would
[1:03:10] predestinate you because he saw how
[1:03:13] Wicked Satan would be and he would put
[1:03:15] that in you and he said he put your name
[1:03:17] today and now he says now look at where
[1:03:20] he is the church positionally before the
[1:03:23] foundation of the World God in his labor
[1:03:26] pain bringing you forth positionally
[1:03:28] placing you to be a housewife a farmer a
[1:03:33] preacher a prophet he preached you POS
[1:03:36] he placed you
[1:03:38] positionally and he says now we are his
[1:03:41] subjects we must walk close to the
[1:03:43] author to understand it Lord what will
[1:03:47] you have me to do must I go to the
[1:03:50] fields and preach the gospel must I stay
[1:03:52] at home no matter what what it is if I
[1:03:55] must be a good housewife a good mother
[1:03:57] if I must do this if I must be a farmer
[1:04:01] Lord what would you have me to do I want
[1:04:03] to be in my position I don't want to try
[1:04:06] to be more than I ever ought to be let's
[1:04:08] stand together let's have the musicians
[1:04:10] come
