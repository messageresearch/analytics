TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Romans chapter 12 verses 4-6 Romans chapter 12 verses 4- six enjoy the lovely music and Leadership of the worship tonight just uh would be uh easy just to kind of sit there and sing from one song to the next and just get lost in the presence of the Lord Romans chapter 12 we're going to begin with verse four uh Paul says in verse three though I didn't include in part of my text he's uh speaking that man not to think more of himself than he ought to and he's going to speak of the context that one would have within the body to be sure that they're sober and uh and conscious that uh God has dealt different measures and different gifts so we shouldn't think more than what we ought to and certainly we can't think bigger than the body no one member is bigger than the body Romans chapter 12:4 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith and then he continues on Ministry and exhortation but I wanted just to use this as our text today and we'll come to it here in a few moments and we desire that God would bless the Bible which we read we know that it's infallable and inspired and we trust that God will just amplify it to us by Revelation you may be seated I'd like to start by reading a statement that we ended with on Sunday and it it's uh quite a heavy statement I think and we were looking at how God's first Masterpiece was a family not just one man but that it was comprised of man and woman under a commandment to have seed to have children and he says notice the Great Masterpiece of the family and then he begins to kind of describe the elements that would pertain to family the husband and wife cannot truly be truly a family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family so this language he begins to use uh is a masterpiece a Great Masterpiece of a family now we have a contrast and then even truly a family then a contrast of not a good family he says wife pulling one way and the husband another that would make an awful family so he's using some very strong language bringing up a very Stark contra between families he says but in agreement with love one to another that's a family and that was God's masterpie and now all the true family here portrays that and so we could take what brother bam is saying here and I believe that we could make the statement that a true family is a picture of Harmony and love it says all in agreement and love one to another that's a family and so with that uh with that image before us all in agreement uh uh in with uh love one to another a he says all true family here portrays that Harmony portrays that love so we get this picture of m a true family is one that's in Harmony and one that's in love in love with one another and all these parts are working so well together and then brother brandham introduces this other language on one hand you have not a good family or an awful family and then we have uh truly a family a true family or a masterpiece family and just in reading that I know that there's every single one of us will interpret this differently and we'll kind of begin to digest it but we filter it through our own experience we filter it through what we see and and how we feel and just by reading this statement immediately we can start think well I don't always get along with my spouse and well I'm I I I'm aranged from a family member and we start thinking about our own family history and it we can paint a very different picture of what our family circumstance is than what's being presented here in this statement and so the title that I want to have for the service to tonight is true family Ash no filter and and maybe for some this is just right over their heads for others it might be a little bit beneath them now but eventually all of us will be caught up on the use of a hashtag but this this title I I I wanted to have significance in using this because we have a true family uh that we're wanting to lift up that brother bam says is a picture of Harmony a picture of love a picture of agreement but I'm using this this hashtag even in my title uh to address what the expectations we have when we think about family and maybe more particularly when we the expectations we begin to form when someone's preaching on family or we hear certain F ideal about family because when we read the statement or we start thinking about family we hear certain things preached about family we form a picture in our mind of what family what we think the word says or what this preacher says a family should look like and we immediately begin to compare it to our own family portrait and we begin to compare ourselves to the image that we see uh in people's opinions or what we're processing it what we perceive it to be and we can have even unreasonable expectations about what a true family is and having those expectations it put pre puts pressure on us we think well I have to behave a certain way I have to act a certain way and so I'm using this uh no filter thought uh to kind of address those expectations um to bring to our mind that there are pressures that we place upon ourselves there's pressures that are placed upon us externally about how our family looks how it acts how we raise our children how we interact with one another within a family and then maybe even in some ways we're addressing our perceptions of other people uh how we form those perceptions and how those perceptions themselves will place pressure on us and I find this that as soon as you uh mention uh you it doesn't happen all the time and I'm certainly not trying to put this on you if you haven't done so but we can get nervous when people talk about families uh I even will say that even for sister Elizabeth she she's uh encouraged me well remember we have single people in the church and remember we have those who don't have family and so it just expresses how sometimes we can get nervous are you going to leave somebody out and what about grandparents and what about those who are single and what about those who are difficult situations and so all of us uh uh we could for some reason or another we can begin to get a little bit nervous like oh boy where is this headed and then I'm also very conscious of the fact that things like this it's uh you really set yourself up for a Target I've personally endured a lot of criticism uh for preaching on family and typically the comments are we'll just wait till he has teenagers and so let me just say up front if anything I say gives you the impression that I think I'm an expert on this uh I I I apologize and stop me uh after service and say look when you made that comment it gave everybody the impression that you get it got it figured out and I will print a full retraction in the morning and the next time I get up behind the pulpit I will clarify I in no way was uh uh pretending to be an expert on the subject matter I preached on father Hood one time and I titled the message the seven bad habits of a highly in ineffective father because I didn't know what the good habits were I'd only learned by experience what the bad habits were so I could speak from experience what the bad habits of a highly ineffective father were but I can say this as a as a a servant of the Lord a as one that studies the Bible in the message of the hour that we have re a resource in the word of God that we can teach from that that puts forth excellent examples of parenting and and how to behave as children and teenagers and a lot of lot of things in the word that deal with these things so some may be critical of it but I don't believe a minister setting himself forth with his opinion impostering himself as somebody that should be looked to as an authority but I trust that in looking at this we point to the word of God and you know that that's what I'm derived these teachings from and it can give you confidence that if it's a word of the Lord then there's a power of God to come behind it to help you fulfill it and so as we teach on this and we have this subject object of no filter my object is not to create a complex uh for anyone as uh certain images are lifted up as we said in a moment ago you say family immediately begin to think well that means a man and a woman with children and you may not fit that moment uh you may not have that particular dynamic in your life so these things when they're spoken of they're not done in a way to cause a complex or immediately begin to make you feel self-conscious well uh how do we raise our are we raising our children right and if we do this and if we do that and it we begin to get a little bit nervous and a little bit too self-conscious about the things we're saying and the way we're and the way we're acting and we do so because we might feel more like an awful family that brother brandham identifies than we do a true family say man husband pulling this way wife pulling that way and we just might immediately begin to see ourselves that way but I would hope that anytime a subject is addressed it could come forth in a positive way and being and having a positive gospel it would there would be no condemnation in it there would be no h no beating you up and making you feel worthless and tearing down your experience but finding resources and material to build you up to encourage you to strengthen you and give you the tools that you need to succeed as a Christian as a as a family member and I'm using this uh hashtag no filter which is a social media hashtag to address what some of our instincts are when it comes to the subject of family and what some of our misconceptions are because this hashtag no filter it's used um it's a common hashtag especially on Instagram I believe that's where it gained its traction and was used uh first and it was used for pictures that had not been altered uh with any filter or were supposed to have no visual enhancement no filter anything editing no photoshopping so it was presented as this is exactly how the image struck the lens uh either suggesting that the scenery itself the person itself had this uh this innate Beauty and it was perfect in the way that the image struck the lens or it was just a a photographer who knew just exactly how to utilize light and to frame a picture just right it was used to say hey what you're looking at is what it is the image hasn't been manipulated at all it's not something's not being conveyed to you that the one who was standing here uh uh didn't behold with his naked eye you're seeing it just as it is and my my point to use this filter is that we would all just be honest with ourselves and that even in ministering we would be honest about about the struggles that we all have when it comes to being a family the difficulties that come with raising children having Harmony in marriage uh the challenges that uh we face in family whether it be extended family or with in-laws or even our own parents and be honest about how even as Christians and message Believers it's not that we somehow Exempted ourselves from difficult relationships and we've just kind of found that Groove where everybody loves us and we all get along and we don't talk about politics over Thanksgiving that's not the reality right if you're afraid that someone's going to hear you say Amen don't you know maybe just move your eyebrows very fervently so I could at least you know know that you're in agreement or aent or just keep one raised so I at least know you're questioning what I'm saying but you're hearing it and we there's uh we want to be honest with ourselves just about the reality of life that not uh that uh though we preach that our marriages should be in Harmony and husbands should love their wives as Christ loves the church we realize that as husbands we do not always love our wives we probably constantly question ourselves what does that even mean how could I even do that how can I love perfectly and and and how can I be loved perfectly and we realize these are very difficult standards that the scripture elicits and we feel very woeful woefully short and fall short of what these standards are and so we're not going to try to pretend that everything's perfect and you need to get perfect and you need to have this perfect picture but rather this idea of no filter is used to just at the very beginning if the Lord would lead us to teach on this subject maybe for a few Services maybe in great detail or maybe just every once in a while we' realize that we want to do it with an honest look and not with the purpose of trying to create some kind of image that we're all striving to attain that doesn't first acknowledge that it's very difficult doesn't first acknowledge that things are messy doesn't first acknowledge that we all have different experiences and come from different directions and we'll have a different expression of what a true family looks like and so the purpose is to encourage not discourage and in no way should I believe the word be used uh to create a pressure a carnal pressure so that we conform to a carnal image and we can we do that without the pressure but then there's certain ideals and certain things that are done and certain uh uh Endeavors that some families might have and it might be even indicative of how one would preach and how they would want to raise their family and then there can be PR pressure that if somebody uh would would never let their children do this and uh and that becomes kind of a standard to someone I would never let my children do this we wouldn't want to become feel the pressure to conform to the image that that family has established for them and their children just by virtue of peer pressure or whether there be some kind of authority associated with it and we all kind of feel like well I guess we should all put our kids in Taekwondo because they're doing it and before you know it you're doing things that you're very uncomfortable with and so there shouldn't be this pressure just because one person does something a certain way and really one of the things that happens even when it comes to the word of the Lord God can begin to move someone can choose to be baptized and it puts a pressure on somebody else oh well I'm the same age and I see them getting baptized and you should never obey the word of God because of external pressure nor should you ever just do something and follow something that someone else is doing because you feel the pressure to conform to a particular image and so we can experience external pressure while this is the way things are done well you know brother Aaron and sister Elizabeth homeschooled their kids listen don't ever think that because we homeschool our kids we think that you should I don't think that just because uh uh we would choose maybe uh to do something and make a particular decision that means we've got this judgment upon everybody else well they're doing this with their kids and they let their kids do this and they let their kids do that hey away with that kind of stuff we use the word as our Plum line we go by the word of God if the word of God says to do do something then that would be your expectation that would be your measuring stick but if if we homeschool our kids we don't have this expectation that everybody else should because we realize that's a personal decision it's an individual decision and there's a lot more factors that go into it than just wow there's some bad influences at school right there's more that goes into it and so and maybe I'm just being very personal with our church tonight and I hope that's okay and because I realize there can be external pressure based based upon activity or standard ards or or certain things that are done let's not pressure ourselves the external pressure is bad enough that we start internalizing things and begin to put pressure on ourselves and so we would desire that in what we would preach and any standard that we might point to in the word of God or any example that we might use and if we use a personal example our desire would and even especially if I could bring it back to this idea of not having a filter and we'll go into it in more detail to where it may make more sense but you take a p picture and you filter it to where you remove hey I got a bad cold sord could you remove that in the picture you know my hair was could you add more hair back there like you're kind of catching my bald spot so then you see the picture and it's nothing like what the reality was and we don't want to paint the picture of family to where you're looking at it's always perfect it's always nothing's out of place and everything seems so Rosy and and it it creates this pressure on you so when speaking about difficult subjects and and even lifting up a standard in the word of God a family a truth family is a picture of Harmony and love and and we work together and we let Christ have preeminence and the tokens applied we would just be Desiring to inspire uh um that there'd be it inspire you to be genuine inspire you to to be honest with yourselves and so that ultimately we would all just strive to be better Christians that we' realize that we could always challenge ourselves to do better and that we can do better as Christians we can do better in our relationships and we can do better as it within our family and as a member of a family that that's what we want we want to be genuine we want to be honest we want to strive to do better and we never want to become arrogant and we never want to become legalistic but that's what these teachings are to do is to uh allow us to be genuine uh in our approach to the word of God to be honest with ourselves and what God's requiring of us so that we would have be at Liberty to strive to do better and not because we feel that we're being forced or we have to conform or I guess this is just the way that it should be but rather God genuinely dealing with the part of an individual to come into His Image and so using this image of no filter we're obviously looking at um a habit of social media and I'll say this at the beginning I just was kind of wrestling just with order maybe to structure my thoughts but I'll say it now and I hope you could hold through this thought through the next um few slides I want to use because it might seem like I've completely departed from uh preaching and then going into who knows what you think might think it might be but keep this in mind that this would be kind of my my my title or my thesis statement for this next segment of the sermon is that church should not create the same negative dynamics that Social Circles or social media do like church should not create in teachings the teachings of a church what standards that we teach in the message even a standards the church should have a and certain requirements that you would have for offices within the church those teaching and those requirements and those expectations should not create the same kind of negative dynamics that Social Circles do because you could have a Social Circle and it's the peer pressure when everybody does something wrong you want to do something wrong with it or everybody's forcing you to act a certain way because it's part of the social structure and we ministered on this in this subject of who is my neighbor how it's this pressure to conform and that sway to follow the crowd and we emphasized how church should not operate under those same Dynamics but there should be a higher power motivating the individuals to be part of a local assembly where it's God that's working in the individual parts and we're moving according to how God deals with us by Revelation it's a holy spirit at work and we don't fall for these uh these traps of of pressure and legalism and abuse and control to get everyone to kind of line up and create a very clean neat picture and like whoa isn't that church isn't everything just right and in place and so we do not want Church to create the same negative dynamics of that come with social media that's what I'll start to look at here for a few moments is how our interaction with social media and the way that we engage with it tends to promote more of a negative feeling than it does a positive one and I think that has just been so absolutely proven and even if you just went by your own experience I think that you would uh would agree with that but these carefully and I want to use a very deliberate phrasing as we talk about how a true family is a picture of Harmony and love when you think about about a social media post these carefully curated uh meticulously planned a a and heavily eded posts that are placed on social media they ultimately just deceive because you look at something and it's kind of like oops didn't mean to take that picture and and and you're led to believe that this is just them in in the Raw State and this is just how their their backyard looks every sunset and and this is what their kitchen looks like when they're done cooking dinner and you look at it you're like my goodness I wish had a kitchen like that and man you see that guy's office and and and you think about their family outings and their vacations and you see pictures of some of family vacation on Instagram you're like how come we don't have vacations like that right and very rarely do you see the hotel room right or the car but they're they're planned very meticulously uh they're carefully curated you don't see the whole film roll you just get the one that finally was cropped enough and filtered enough and was just the right angle and edited enough to where it's like this is what I want other people to think I'm seeing and I'm doing and really it deceives the one who's looking at it and so could you just show hands if you know what I'm talking about amen if you're not on social media have you ever used Airbnb or Trip Advisor and you saw the photos of the hotel and you're like booking that baby you're like that thing is spacious you see the size of the the hot tub that comes with the room and it just looks amazing and then you get there and you're like man they should pay this photographer a million bucks because they figured out all the force perspective and the Angles and everything to make you think everything was spacious and it was clean you didn't realize the pictures were 10 years old and you didn't realize it this every it's all because of photography they're able just to do it in just such a way to where it strikes the eye wow this is awesome this looks great and you look at man look at that antique furniture look at all those nice uh monochromatic this is like Pinterest at its best this is inst grammable I want to stay there and you get there and everything's dirty and everything's from Ikea and it's nothing like you thought so you don't have to be on Instagram to relate to what I'm talking about it's just be tricked by a picture before and that's what we're talking about and so I want to move on because there's so much that we could get lost in a lot of this and I found myself just getting pulled different directions this week and I want to stay very deliberate in a very narrow vein in looking at this phenomena but social media images are very influential not just because we see see them but because we interact with them be one thing just to see an image but social media somehow draws Us in to where when we see an image we like it we upvote it we we uh we comment on it we link to it we repost or retweet there's certain things that we do so we're not just a casual Observer of something but we're kind of drawn in and asked uh uh um um to hit that like button and we're we're we're prompted to subscribe and we're prompted to comment and we're kind of drawn into it and sometimes they they get us to engage in that's like comment and you may win a free trip wow I I better subscribe I better um get an account I better subscribe I better comment because I want to I want to win this new iPad I want to do this and what is it it's prompting you to interact and to engage on the platform so the images and the videos and the things that are uh uh the content that's created it's not just something you're beholding casually but you're kind of drawn in and it's in more influential because you interact with it and then there's a pressure that comes with it and if anybody's felt this before they might just give me a real hearty amen but if you engage on the platform especially as a content creator there's a pressure to get content out there and you say well I I I mean I just I just post pictures of of myself I just post pictures of my family once you get into it and you see how it works you can't just take that candid photo anymore of your baby playing with Legos right you got to make sure they're wearing that one onesie right with the colors just right you got to be sure that that really nice vintage blanket is draped over the couch the just right way and and you really start put listen if somebody feels like I'm talking their language no I just know how it is or talking about you I'm not talking about you and uh I don't have a vintage blanket and I don't know what the right colors are for the onesie so I'm not talking about myself but it's the images you see and you see what gets traction and what people like and what goes viral and and so even if you're just a regular Joe so now I'm St talking to brother Joe there's pressure to now I don't want to just post a family picture I don't want to just post a picture of my kids I don't just want to post a picture of the cake but I want all the lighting to be right I want the filter to be right I want the background to be right I want the mess all to be clean up and it puts pressure on the one posting to where it's got to be good or you won't get the likes you won't get the comments and at the really at the heart of it I won't be portraying the image that I want everyone to perceive about my cakes and then not only is there pressure on the one that's posting pressure to produce the pressure to refine the pressure to make it perfect but then there's a pressure on those who are following to participate and then by virtue if it's more of a social thing and not so much someone who's trying to make a living on social media then it becomes this well they posted this then I want to post that and I want to reply and I want to link to it and you kind of want to have this camaraderie that you know I've got cute kids too and I've got a vintage throw as well and I've a onesie just like that right me personally with feet and everything and so it it draws you in and there becomes a real it's becomes a real cycle of pressure and then you're listen that applies I'm not even talking to Christians I I could probably get eight more amens if I was just talking to the the lunch crowd at the mall so to redeem this I might try it tomorrow but as Christians I maybe it should ring a a little bit more true that there's a pressure that's put on us when we engage in social media and somebody asked me when we do you have a mission statement drafted yet I'm like a Miss I mean what goes into this I mean I got got so much work to do and I said no but I have a social media policy drafted was one of the first things the Lord dealt with me on and and and I I will say this not as a means to articulate it more perfectly but to help you understand the background that I'm coming from is that I realized that if I if we as a church wanted to have a a visible presence on social media then that can become a Gateway or means by which we all begin to participate on certain platforms and there's a pressure that comes with the platform there's an expectation that comes with it and then there's more points of contact and engagement that would go outside of just what the church is doing and then the pre the pressure is not only on the person who's in charge of the church Instagram account the pressure is not only on the people who are there to find out if service is being canceled but you make other contacts you begin to like other people and it kind of snowballs to where just one effort of a church to engage an audience can put pressure on a lot of bit a lot of different people and I would just as soon avoid it all together and so anybody recognize this Instagram I almost used the retro logo but going with the the more modern one kind of odd maybe to speak of Instagram being retro but when Instagram was originally and this is where that not filter is probably the most predominant when they were initially conceived and begin to establish itself they made very uh deliberate and conscious choices in their design and and the way that this is summarized is they made this these design choices that led to what they call a culture what was called a culture of perfection so this is something in the intent of these th those that conceived this platform and and how the users would engage in it what would be promoted and certain choices they made about what could be posted and how it would look and It produced a culture of perfection and in doing so it signal to the users and those who' engage on this platform and post pictures it told them kind of signal to them that the users that to post on Instagram is to enhance and in turn to deceive now this is not these are not my words like wow brother aon's really highlighting some of his conclusions here this is what the the autobiographers this is what this the writers had to say this is what uh people who studied Instagram and the founders of Instagram had to say about themselves it created a culture of perfection and it signal to those who would be posted on the platform that if you post on Instagram you enhance you've got to make it look better you got to make it look strong you got to make it look more bold and they even provided uh filters as a part of the product and the whole point was in turn to deceive and they say that it gave users permission to present their re reality as more beautiful than it actually was so you were being enabled and you were being encaged look I mean if you're going to be taking a picture that corn dog there's a way that you can do this where everybody begins to crave a corn dog and so they and they they gave you the permission they gave you not only the tools but they felt you they made you feel comfortable that I can present the reality of of of of my day to the reality of my of my room and my cozy place and all these I can present it in a way that might be somewhat deceiving because it's going to convey it in in a reality that seems more beautiful than it actually is you ever tried to take a picture of a full moon like man that is so beautiful and you go out there with your camera dtin and you go what I mean what happened right it doesn't come out quite exactly like you're seeing it and so maybe the opposite is true in how sometimes they take a picture of the some their room or their or theirselves and the Selfies and it looks so amazing and so stunning but really in real ity is nothing close to it in reality and so we are misled in many ways about the reality of the images that we're looking at we're misled we're we're caused to think something a certain way and believe a certain way about these images being posted on social media and there's a lot of ways that we're deceived by it this was said specifically about this app itself and this platform Instagram itself is that it was designed it was not designed as a neutral technology where you could just download it and use it to upload photos or you know share photos of the grandkids uh to grandparents but it was not designed to be neutral but it was a carefully crafted experience designed to shape behavior and create emotional attachment this is the the purpose behind uh Instagram and I guess as I'm preaching it I realize I might have been a little bit naive to think that there's no way this is going to come off as preaching against Instagram I wasn't even wanting to preach about Instagram I was just wanting to use these ideals of posting things in the image that's created because let's go back to the beginning we have a picture of an awful family or we have a picture of a true family and we have the pressure that's placed upon us when we hear the ideals of scripture and the the the the quotations and and the and the Paul saying how husbands should love their wives and wives respect their husbands and we get this image of a family perfectly and Holiness and everything neat and clean the token applied and we have this image but we're going to be honest with ourselves and say' look we're not going to filter Our Lives we're not going to filter things there's no filter we're going to look at our lives honestly and we want to be authentic in how we live our lives but we want to be striving for excellence we want to be striving for a walk with God for the token to be app applied to be a true family that's our aspiration to be a true family but we don't want to just to try to apply a filter to create the image that we think everybody should see in our marriage and in our family that's right and we've learned this by the way that we've engaged in social media the way that we post to Facebook the way that we post to Instagram the way that we use Snapchat the way that we use any platform let me just capture all of us the way that we use Google+ um that there's a way that it's we're misleading ourselves there's a way that we're engaging in an experience that's carefully crafted that's used to shape behavior and create an emotional attachment this is actually very explicit in the uh in the purpose of Facebook that they have designed find it and implement it and change it so that they can increase the frequency with which you visit Facebook and then increase the duration of the visit and they would be happy to do it to increase it to the point to where you're always there 247 they want you going there as often as possible and staying as long as possible that's the goal and the design behind it I thought this statement was very profound Kevin's sister co-founder of Instagram said Instagram is not for half eaten sand sandwiches why it's got to be intact it's got to be perfect you take the picture before you start eating you make sure you use the right filter you make sure you frame it just right on the plate make it look better than the menu there's listen let's all just say Amen there's Foods we don't even like but we've seen a picture of like I would eat it absolutely right down the goet I'd have two of them like and I don't even like oysters right but it just looks so good the way they do it I don't mind oysters myself I was just dramatized in somebody else who's not an oyster lover but this is the ideal behind it Instagram is not for half eaten sandwiches why the point that he's trying to make is we we don't just take the candid we don't just use the raw we don't use the unfiltered it needs to be thought out it needs to be planned it needs to have the it needs to create the kind of image that people would crave and desire to have the same thing or make them feel really really bad about the sandwich they're eating because that's ultimately what happens you're eating lunch you see a picture what somebody else eats is eating and you get this Envy Food Envy you begin to get jealous oh man I wish I was eating that I wish I could be at that restaurant I wish I could have that food that's the danger of these perfectly curated and crafted and edited and Polished photos that we post on social media Ecclesiastes chapter 1:8 says all things are full of Labor man cannot utter it all the things that are in the world and even as he's uh bringing it to the thought that the things that are in the world are vanity there's all sorts of Ambitions and Endeavors and desires and things that we do and things that we accomplish that the labor of man and what he has done is so great that man cannot really utter it all or explain what he is doing yet I would impose this yet in there yet the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing that the world is full of Labor and all things are full of Labor and all the things that man does and all the things that he accomplishes and all the things that he would produce yet he still the eye is not satisfied in seeing what is done nor the ear filled with with hearing that by Nature it's dealing with the fact that we by Nature are constantly Desiring greater fulfillment if you have one you want another if you have two you want three if you've experienced this you want to experience more and it speaks to the nature of man that there with certain things you can't see enough of it you can't hear enough of it the more you see the more you want the more you hear the more you want and that you never actually get to the place like oh you know I've had enough of that I'm done you just get drawn more into it you don't you can't ever play the game enough you're like I've had my fi go ahead delete it I don't need anymore you need more of it and you engage and you I want more of it and it speaks to this this downside of human nature that can become addicted to something that the appetite becomes insatiable and that's how these social media platforms and the posting of pictures and the liking them and following the pursuit of them becomes addictive is because the eye has never satisfied with seeing nor the ear of hearing creates an insatiable desire in Proverbs chap 31:30 think about this then in the context of this phenomena favor is deceitful charm Acceptance in some translations it's Grace but it's not speaking of the grace of God but more the way that one would conduct themselves charm acceptance favor is deceitful which is fraudulent fake leads to disappointment favor is deceitful and beauty is vain Beauty speaks of the Elegance of shape it's the external image the C of features the proportion of Parts this is what is meant in the Hebrew favor is deceitful beauty is vain vain is this emptiness this is what it's describing you think about a woman who who would have a certain way about her and a certain way of acting and presenting herself and then even the beauty the image of her her physical shape it's this Elegance the Symmetry the proportions that that is Vanity so it's deceitful and it's vanity just use that in the image that we create could be about people could be about things but this is the same thing when it comes to images when it comes to our person it's especially relevant because that's what it's speaking to but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised so the fear of the Lord is above all above the appearance and the charm and the Symmetry and the beauty that would be external because the Bible is saying that beauty and favor give a false representation of what's really down on the inside favor is deceitful it causes you could think that with this person's Elegance the way that they carry themselves or this beauty that this person has you begin to think about oh this person is a certain way but it says it's Vain and deceitful so these things actually convey an image that's not true certain elements certain looks certain ways of carrying themselves the Symmetry and proportion of Parts the the natural or even artificial Beauty the Bible saying it's vain it's empty and not only is it Vain and empty but it's deceitful why they could hide things hide a bad temperament hide a an Unfaithful action a a depraved mind even Beauty itself the Bible teaches and we real it's just fleeting even the the pleasure that you might derive from something like that it's not lasting it's fleeting it's something that you don't you're not going to gain the the long-term satisfaction it's just a moment it's just a picture it's just a it's just an image there's really no weight or anything you can carry that it just goes away as soon as the as as soon as the camera's turned off this is what the Bible's telling us about ay an image that's not real and how a image that's not real provokes this base Instinct the eyes never satisfied with seen the ear with hear with hearing and so there's a so there's there was this I don't know when it was and maybe I could have been a better student of it but you certainly have to be very careful and uh navigating social media but because everything was uh filtered and presented in such a way there was a kind of a push back against the filtered post and that's how the hashtag of no filter begin to be used because somebody would post a picture of themselves and and they would post a picture and they would filter it and everything would look real beautiful and the hair color just stunning and the eyes just unreal and and then it would be presented as this as reality so then there's a movement of people say We'll post things and we'll say hash no filter because this is kind of a push back against this filtering that's on the these platforms and people editing their photos and cropping them and doing it in such a way where where it conveys an image that's not true they want you to think that when they use the hashtag no filter that they are in fact just presenting to you the image just raw the way that it is but really there's a no filter fallacy they did a study of tens of thousands of different pictures and they found that 12% of all the no filter pictures posted that are posted are filtered some of them were of food most of them are of people so when you kind of extrapolate the data and you could conclude that of the millions and millions of hundreds of millions of photos that are posted to Instagram there's tens of millions of them that'll say this is raw this is unedited this is unfiltered when in fact it is so now they're really trying to deceive you they want you to say oh no this there's no filter there's no trickery going on here this is the way that it is and what's happening we are being duped into thinking that this is the way that it is we're being duped into thinking that this uh that be or the the very effort of people using no filter is they want you convince you that this is their natural beauty this is the natural state that you're perfect and completely natural in that image with no AIDS whatsoever what does that do creates pressure on the one who's looking I said I wish I could have hair like that I wish my vacations could be like that I want a dog like that let's go get a dog doesn't that dog look so cute why no filter hey this is what it is ruff ruff this is this is life this is raw this is unfiltered isn't it beautiful isn't it easy isn't it wonderful but yet they are perpetuating a lie because they want you to think this is without a filter when in fact it is so it just continues to perpetuate the reality Distortion that's taking place with people being able to use just Snippets and little images of their life telling you a story that everything's perfect everything's great no trouble here and then we believe it and so the social media climate just blurs the line between reality and Fabrication we begin to like things that are completely fabricated we begin to think certain things are idealistic that are completely fabricated and we want to achieve certain results that were achieved through trickery achieved through through um editing that it's not really a reality it's not presented to you correctly and you say well want to achieve that and I've tried and I've tried and I've tried there's even been with respect to music where there was some kind of guitar Rift that was used and musicians for decades have tried to figure it out and finally the guy who did it says oh I recorded it then played it backwards and like oh we were chasing something that could never be done or it was sped up in post- production and people are trying how do you do it how do you do it it's impossible it's impossible we can't figure it out why because it's been produced to be that way it wasn't the actual track it wasn't the way that it was originally done and people spend their whole lives trying to replicate something and it's all built upon a lie beat themselves up we want to do this we want to do this we want to do this we want to do this and it's just a a fabrication why because the lines between fact and reality have been blurred through these images that are that we perceive or that are presented even in photojournalism I'd come across it and I was going to maybe use some pictures and I I I think I had a little bit of foresight to know I'd run out of time tonight so I don't have them but I kept the note where in photojournalism there's this great debate that edited photos create and they use this phrase questions of objectivity truth ethics and deception just even with respect to photojournalism so you're looking at the cover of Newsweek or you're on newsweek.com and you see a picture of a protest in Iran and and it's a very striking image and it's very engaging and the color just right right and everything's very very nice but you look at the original image and you're like well was kind of dark a little bit muddy that's not as not as inviting and not as spectacular but they use an editing post editing process a post- production process to produce something that's a little bit more bold a little bit more striking and there's even a debate within photojournalism that this is dishonest that this isn't ethical and that this we we're really blurring the lines of what's objective and what's truthful why because it's the way that the audience is being engaged and then tricked in their engagement the United Kingdom Public Health in 2017 they named Instagram the worst app for mental health for young people for these very reasons mental health experts for years for decades have shown concern of the harmful impact of unrealistic images on the the of people how it impacts people they found through their research that editing selfies and editing photos of yourself are associated with body image uh uh uh difficulties or disturbances and and associated with eating disorders when the person's editing their own photos they say that posting and filtered and edited versions of yourself lower self-esteem you're doing it to try to make yourself look better but you're only making yourself feel worse you only have more anxiety about the picture that's being taken how people are perceiving it whether or not they're liking it pressure on you to con to convey the Right image anybody agree anybody know what I'm talking about I mean we felt this pressure before there were selfies before there was the internet but now it's just Amplified uh many times over and those who take pictures of themselves and try to get the right filter take the picture again try to edit it try to slim this try to do that they're just putting more and more pressure on themselves and the people who may be able to present to you that they're beautiful they're Dynamic they're rich they have all these things they are lying to you and they know it and their self-esteem gets lower and lower and lower they get more anxious more depressed and you think they live a Charmed Life but it's somebody else's Lamborghini right it's just a movie St set not their own jet so you might ask yourself brother Aon ask me rather how what in the world does this have to do with church what in the world does this have to do with family remember we said at the very outset Church the teachings of a church should never create the same negative dynamics that social media and Social Circles do these elements and these things that have made social media uh um effective and and so captivating that's not what church is all about church isn't about creating just the right Lighting on the platform and and an engaging worship band and everything just be so perfect where it's like well who wouldn't enjoy that who wouldn't enjoy the the syncopation who wouldn't enjoy uh the Rhythm who would enjoy this who wouldn't enjoy that and it's like you just you could hey come to church if you're a music lover you'll get you like it right that's that's not the goal that's not the aim that's not the the the the the purpose of it all and so how does this relate to church how does it relate to family I would say this we're not striving for visual Perfection we're not striving to produce the image that's postable in the end for social purposes and teaching on family or presenting a scriptural image of family is not an exercise of somehow posting a filtered image of what a family should be that we are not and we should not ourselves or I should not as one teaching it none of us should create unrealistic expectations based upon what we perceive to be the desired result in the end well if this is what it needs to be then we create these unrealistic expectations well I guess I got to look like this I guess I guess I got to be like that listen it can be a very true aspiration it could be the very goal this is what family should look like this is what family should be like but you're not going to get there overnight I mean take the stature of a perfect man take the image of a godly man take the example of Jesus Christ take the humility of our Prophet you say well I want to be more humble and you say well somehow I'm going to get there by the morning listen this is something we can see and we can Inspire to be but not create these unreasonable expectations that if I'm not it tomorrow I guess I can't ever be it if my family's not that way now then I guess my family can never be that way if my marriage isn't that way within a week or so then I guess it'll never be that way get rid of the unreasonable expectations get rid of the carnal way of say oh I see what you're trying to do God let me just take a hold of that and make that happen just put the word before you as an aspiration and say God I'll never get there without your help but I'm setting my eyes towards it we can create unreal unrealistic expectations based upon the perception that we have of what an ideal family is oh the perfect family does this the perfect family all wears matching clothes and plays putt putt on thir Thursday evenings and be sure everyone sees the pictures of it this is what our family does and our family created a compliment jar and every time you create you say a compliment we put this in it and then once the jar is full you get to use that money on something for your sibling and it's encouraging them to compliment and and we're like we got to get a compliment jar we've got to do this what happens it works one day and then you come by six months later and there's a quarter in the compliment jar like how in the world did all those kids buy socks for their siblings with the compliment jar that's a complete madeup thing by the way just made it up off the top of my head if anybody wants to run with it just let me patent this real quick let me you know create it take some ownership of it all right I've already got the the trademark on compliment jars and we because this is what someone was doing and we said this is what a family does this is what families do this is perfect this is is great all because we hear somebody else is doing it and sometimes we just have to be honest with ourselves so did you like it did the compliment jar work was wasn't that great in your family getting along like no it didn't work for us I guess we just don't have authentic enough mason jars and maybe with a little levity some of these things won't hit uh the wrong way or too hard we got we've got to be very careful about church ideation the concepts we have of church uh um the the the the ideologies the ideation we have of church and family very careful with that the thoughts and Concepts that we associate with church we have to be very very careful about the church or the families church or family idolization wherein we idolize a particular image of a church we idolize particular families within a church we have to be very careful I would just say this don't idolize any of them don't idolize a church don't idolize a family you could look up to one you could get certain uh encouragement from one or see an example and we ought to be that as families we ought to be that as a church but we have to be very careful with these family ideations these church ideations and then very careful because it's so easy sometime to idolize families to idolize church and I as I Ponder this and I'm just just looking at my the quotations and statements I have before me just to uh just to know kind of which way we're going this is coming across a lot more slowly than anticipated but we can Envy somebody and say I wish I had a marriage like them and think about the data points you're basing that on you base it upon what you see one day a week with just certain glimpses for just a little bit of time and then they leave and they go and maybe it's maybe it's influenced a little bit by social media but I hope we've kind of tore that construct down a little bit maybe we do it when we go over to to their home and what do you do when you have somebody over for dinner the house is clean you cook something you know is good and you leave and you're like I wish my house was always that clean I wish I could cook and they just assume wow they eat like that every night her house is always like that no no what do you do you get the house clean you cook the thing you know you can really cook right unless you're really really close with them then you don't care and those are the dinners you really enjoy and and and that's really when your families you're not worried about pretense and impressing somebody you just enjoy them and that's what church should be about that's what family should be about that's what our friendship should be about but we see somebody and we Envy them like oh you know what I wish we had a marriage like them I wish we had a home like them and you have no idea the hell that might exist in the home you have no idea just how difficult the marriage might be why it's just a picture it's all a facade it's just an image but yet we'll desire to be like somebody and have no idea just how horrible that life may be you can sometimes en a situation oh I wish I had that job I wish I had that brother schedule I wish I had that house one time we were on a road trip we drove by there beautiful setting it was out in the country or way off the regular roads and we were driving this great big expans of a property in a beautiful white house with black shutters and a black roof and Elizabeth said oh I wish I had a house like that and I said do you want the two marriages that came with it do you want the the the the mortgage or whatever it might be do you want the heartache do you want what comes with it sometimes we look at a situ I wish I had a house like that I wish I had cars like that I wish I had land like that I that's what I want Lord and you come to talk to the guy who got says well I tell you what you got to do what I did it took me three marriages before I figured it out uh never mind I don't want the house I don't want the cars because it's it's just the opt it's something that we see visually we oh I really want that we can desire a certain lifestyle I wish we could live that way I wish we could vacation that way I wish we could have nice things but you don't know the sacrifice it took for those people to be there to get it I I might have been conceiving this thought for later but sometimes we take our beginning and we compare it to some people's middle here we are at the start of a family here we are at the start of a job the start of a career and we're looking at somebody who's 30 years into it that's what I want that's what I wish I had and you see somebody's success you see somebody's possessions you see somebody's lifestyle go I want that I want that I want that but you have no idea the pain the sacrifice the suffering and everything that went in in a positive way to get to where they were and so what we want to do and we do it by uh uh there's certain cities that we've lived in and lived near where people say oh that's that's the rich part of town and you know the reality that's not the rich part of town that's two two income families that are that have high debt loads where they have a high mortgage they got high car payments on both their cars and it may look desirable they might have the square footage they might have the right zip code they might drive the right cars and they might have the right kind of image but there's a lot of debt and there's a lot of less time with family and there's a lot of working to maintain it and it's all a facade you think Scottsdale's got money no a lot of it's just fake amen you got to go to Paradise Valley for the money because it's image it's keeping up with the zip code and so you may desire something and you know you have no idea what the suffering is that comes with it and so when we would lift up a particular uh scriptural principle and we would speak on family or we try to encourage you and and assist you in these things through teaching we're not promoting a particular parenting Style we're not trying to set up a particular Family Image is more desirable than the other but our sole goal is to equip you with resources and encourage you with those resources in the word to be what God wants you to be because the Christian life is not a is not one of competition I want you to ponder this very deeply I'm running out of time tonight and I and I I I regret that but I want to emphasize some of these points the Christian life is not a life of competi comptition and it is not one of comparison and this goes with every aspect of family Holiness standards activities the way that you the the there's so much that can be involved I could give very blatant specifics but if we get caught up in the thing of competing and Counting and qualifying and quantifying and trying to figure out ways to measure success and we come up with our own saber metrics when it comes to church and it comes to Holiness and it comes to family and our you got to get rid of this whole idea the Christian life is not one of competition it is not one of comparison Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26 I'll just kind of paraphrase it he's like why in the world is it that every single one of you comes with something on Sunday one has a Doctrine one has a Pongal one has a tongue one has a revelation one has an interpretation he says let all things be done for edifying and Paul is pointing out this attitude where people showed up and they all had something they want to contribute but they were making a showing of talent oh you think your Revelation was good just wait till you hear these tongues right and it become a competition who can outp spiritualize the next person who can sing better than the next person and and there's competition and there's this uh that begins to crop up and this is very real still in churches this is very real in relationships with in-laws and family members this life is not one of competition this is not one of comparison we are not in NO phase at all are we in competition with each other or anyone else we have one goal the goal is Christ and that goal does not compete with anyone but it competes against the agenda of Satan our goal is Christ I'm not in competition with my brother I'm not in competition with his assets I'm not in competition with his education I'm not in competition with their cooking or what kind of things that they have where they live what they drive how they dress what kind of gifts they have and and what they present in terms of their family identity we are are not in competition with each other we are not in competition with anyone we are not in competition with other churches our goal is Christ our goal is a Rapture amen what are you trying to achieve brother Aaron with your family I want us all to go in a Rapture I want that token to have so much preeminence where I have my right as a father to see that my children are caught up into a meeting in the air that's our aspiration that's our goal I'm not in competition and we're not in competition as a church in Romans 12: 4-6 again let me just paraphrase he saying we're all members of the same body but we don't have the same office so he says if you have different gifts according to the grace that's given you then minister in those gifts according to that which has been given to you by God as you behold that scripture I want you to think about what is being presented in this it's saying be yourself do what is best for you do what is best for your family is God leads you now I'll say it as a caveat there there's you couldn't you couldn't make this bold claim well God's led me to go ahead and have another wife in the home because my wife really needs help and we just believe bless God this is what's really going to solve some of our domestic problems and I can say well if you feel led to do it I'm not saying God's not leading you but I can say it's contrary to the word amen and I can I can apprise you of what you're headed to and the difficulties that may be and I can even express maybe as a friend or a counselor I don't see this in the word of God you could be making a grave mistake be certain to pray about it so I realize that there's certain Avenues and certain things we can say and do brother and I feel really LED of God to go rob a bank and what do a lot of men tell you well you told me you felt led to do it so my hands were tied I couldn't say anything because you told me you felt led what they're just copping out I don't have enough gut to say brother I want you to stop for a minute you mean to tell me that God has led you and you're going to go in the name of the Lord to go rob a bank brother I'm sorry I don't see that according to the word I mean there there there's that's certainly within the purview of a Christian the one of a brother a friend to somebody a minister to stand on the word of God and if you have some kind of unction you have some kind of feeling brother that's right that's fine you feel led to do it let's talk about it let's make sure you're making the right decision I want to I want to promote the leadership of the Lord in your life let's go through this what are you looking at what are the factors you're seeing tell me how God's dealt with your heart and then you can come to a conclusion well you know what I think you're right the Lord seems to be leading you that way or say brother I see some real red flags let's go before the Lord let's put it before the Lord let's agree together that God will make his PL plan for you uh plain so I realize that when I begin to talk about these things be yourself and do as you feel led I'm not going into the area the critics will do it and people try to have a hey day with these things but listen what we're promoting is Christ having preeminence in your life and not people's opinions Christ having preeminence you make the decision that's best for you and your family according to the word of God this is what one of the translations says since we find ourselves fashioned into all these excellent formed and marvelous functioning Parts in Christ's body let us just go ahead and be what we're made to be without endly or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other or trying to be something we aren't comparing anybody seen this before it's not Ohio spelled wrong H yoh H I don't know I kind of stumbled on it assumed there might be a few hikers here in Arizona it means hike your own hike this saying it's real popular the Appalachian Trail and I find it to be with some other ones that they would tell hikers look hike your own hike how somebody else hikes this Trail you don't have to try to pattern yourself after them you don't have to go at their pace you don't have to do the things they do hike your own it's your hike it's your life it's your family it's your responsibility it's your duty you live your life you do as you feel led to do be what you were made to be be yourself do what you feel led to do and be what you were made to be without comparing yourself to other people or trying to be something you're not Mark Twain I believe said comparison is the death of joy it was uh Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt who said comparison is the thief of Joy I may be the first preacher ever to quote Roosevelt and Mark Twain in the same service but either way they're both saying comparison can really really mess up your joy either they kill it take it away and Paul said those that compare themselves to other people are not wise because we have a human nature instinct to compare ourselves compare our possessions to compare our situations and what can happen when we do that you're comparing apples and oranges says in Galatians chapter 6: 3 to 4 for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceiveth himself I thought that had such tremendous application to some of the things we labored on in the beginning about Instagram and The False Image and the filtering of things but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another it's saying that Joy will come to you real happiness real contentment will come to you when when you are doing what God wants you to do and when God is at work in your own life that's God that's do not by comparing yourself to somebody else I can't remember what translation this was in but it says let everyone be sure that he's doing his very best this is how this is put in the in in a modern translation let everyone be sure that he's doing his very best for then he will have the personal satisfaction of work well done and won't need to compare himself with someone else you know what has been the death to some people's growth spiritually is they begin to compare themselves to where other people are spiritually well at least I go to Every service right and we feel somewhat Justified well I'm at every service it's like well you know this did you find out this brother did such and such and that brother did such and such and you've got worse skeletons in your closet you're doing a lot of other worse things but you somehow feel more Justified because you've come up with the scale of spirituality and because you do these things more visually that are better you're like well I'm a little bit you know I feel a lot better and that's the depth of spirituality to spiritual growth when you begin to compare we have one goal Christ amen Christ being our goal we're constantly reassessing challenging ourselves I aspire to be Christlike I don't aspire to be non brother John likee like if I if I'm just as long as I'm not like brother Lucas I feel all right and what happened you'd kill yourself spiritually there's never going to be any growth he becomes your ceiling or at least your attic so let me just bring it to this as Paul is saying with you can just prove your own work do your own job do what you're led to do use the resources God has given you then you sh you can have rejoicing in the work of God in your own life without having to compare it to somebody else or somebody else get all the credit well you know why successful they're just doing what we do just following our pattern who gets all the credit who gets all the praise you know your Mentor your the one who's telling you what to do the one that's coaching you the one that's handling your social media account so I'm try to wrap this up let me bring it to the uh the point that we've been using on this no filter relationships are messy right come on just we're just family here tonight let's be honest no filter on our amens family Dynamics are complicated they can be very unique people can be have different family situations H and certain Dynamics to the family they're vastly different than the ones that you have and and it's easy for us to judge based upon appearances and and let's just be honest with ourselves that relationships themselves can be very unique can be very challenging family Dynamics can be very complicated they can be messy they come with great challenges and when I'm using this at the very beginning true family no filter it means there's no judgment that means there's no pretense it means there's no competition there's no comparison and there's no personal or political pressure on people to conform you don't put it on yourself and let not put it on others where there's some sort of external pressure being placed on certain ideals and certain ways we do things and this is what we do here and this is how we Act and this is how we dress and this is where we go and this is the image that we want to have because everyone's watching and they're looking at you and they're going to judge us and they're going to give us a bad name that's not what we lift up there's no judgment there's no pretense there's no politics there's no Cult of Personality all that goes out the window Christ has preeminence there's no competition so I I realize we're in the after hour but probably there's nothing better just to get you to perk up and just kind of stick with me maybe showing a really nice family picture and this is where I'd really like to uh this work let's see oh there you go this is where I'd really like to bring this in um bring this whole this whole thought into view here's a really nice family picture Sister Ann Loval took these pictures for us I hope that's not a a plug that she do want but uh she took these pictures and you think my I mean I certainly do think this is a beautiful family uh maybe you could take some issue with a little bit of overexposure here or something but and the glare coming off this guy's head but there's not a lot to absorb there but you have you have what is a very beautiful image and this comes in a a Christmas card and you look at like oh what a perfect family what a perfect picture and the image that strikes you this is what you see and this is the image you have of the family and this is what you're carrying in your thoughts around the holidays is this beautiful perfect family picture but it only shows you the end result I mean don't fool yourselves anybody here have family pictures I raise your hand if you've had family pictures and how many of you grit your teeth when you talk about having family pictures all you Brothers say Amen all you kids say Amen all the bribes all the Twisted ears all the pinches we needed filters to get rid of the tear streaks the we all need it why because this is just the one that's chosen among dozens if not hundreds this is the one that at the end you say well it's not perfect but this is better than all the others and it doesn't tell the full story why because there's other pictures I mean there's this is what we see but this is what happens before and look this is what you have I mean Elliot's gone he's not even in the picture this is a perfect this would have been the best family picture because it's just Jack this is Jack all the time and then don't know what else is going on here I mean they got their own thing going on she doesn't look happy with him he looks totally beat down and I'm hiding behind Elliott because I don't want you to see my look but these are the outakes this is on the same film roll but this is what's happening you you got the what do you thinking look they're just looking up to me as usual Preston's just lost in he's on the lake fishing right now daydreaming but these are the other pictures this isn't the one you got in the card is it you didn't see these did you which one did you get you got you got this one right because it it doesn't present the chaos of these pictures but this is probably a better family picture this would present us more accurately you be like why in the world did they choose that one hey no filter in 2021 we just want you to know this is who we are as MCAS this is what our day looks like this is how things are I'm listening to Eliza's G uh complaints about her brothers pran's thinking about fishing Elizabeth's wondering if any of these pictures are going to come out right and this one should have been the one this should have been the picture that made it I'm eating Elizabeth's dusting jack off right but this isn't what you get what do you get you get that you didn't even get this one because we picked the wrong one it was too similar to the other one the one we ruled out no don't do that you know head positions aren't right but this is the one you got what what point am I trying to make in all this we didn't hear back from you about whether or not you liked our picture we want more feedback for next year the musicians would come now that my no I'm just kidding I'm I'm just joking let me wrap this up but what what's the point I'm trying to make the picture doesn't tell the whole story it's a beautiful picture it's a beautiful family but it doesn't tell the story of all the shopping weeks in advance to get the right outfits doesn't it's comical in one sense but it's the reality all the returns all the fitting sessions right all the stressing the coordinating on the date and the time and the planning of the lighting and the location and is it going to be cloudy that day and is the cloud is is it is it going to have the right lighting are we doing it the right time of day is there going to be hikers on the trail are we going to be able to make it to that spot and there's weeks and weeks that go into it for some people I know some of you just kind of pull one off the photo real real candid shot this is just our family every day we wake up this way and you put it on your Christmas card but for a lot of people there's so much that goes into it where you don't see the pressure you don't see the arguing you don't have the the the bribes that are taking place and the threats of punishment and all the crying and all the pressure that goes into family pictures right right Brothers we don't look forward to it right man some some some of you just woke up bless God brother Aaron preach it so the goal of teaching on family we introduced this subject last Sunday the goal of it is not to paint a picture of a perfect family but the goal is to lift up scriptural promises the goal is to point out very word very word principles on which we can place our faith as parents place our faith as spouses set before you word that gives us a plain path to walk in I know this is a way that I can go I know this is something I can walk these are ideals in the word of God these are teachings in the word of God that that directs my path shows me the way that I go and something that it gives us a place a destination that we can walk towards but remember remember always that it's a work in progress I remember one of the things that uh in Ministry stands out to me and I'd never forget it is I was asked to give a speak a a devotion at a men's meeting back in like 2001 or something like that and being the young Minister I was and you know the young Christian I was like brothers just think with all this great teaching we have on being men we can come next time in six months and we're going to be these spiritual Giants and we're going to be creating squirrels and we're probably going to be speaking new bodies for our families and grow in Limbs and it was just like this this if we're getting this kind of teaching just think where we're going to be in six months and brother Lonnie Jenkins got up the next morning was like I don't know what that guy was talking about last night whatever his name was but listen guys this is a race this is a work in progress we're not going to arrive because we have a particular meeting because we have a particular Doctrine this is something where there's endurance it's a work in progress there is no put it in my to there is no final shot there is no perfectly framed picture with no filter isn't this a beautiful family but there are moments there will be moments there'll be times when things are being done right there'll be milestones in our families instances where we achieve something our permanent change is achieved we turn a corner we get rid of things we apply the token there will be Milestones there will be moments but we're not striving to create this perfectly unfiltered picture that's framed in a way that we say this is we're perfect we're here it's always going to be a work in progress and let me just end with this our family ambition I would trust this would be our church ambition is to please God not people as it says in Galatians 1:10 for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to pleased men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ the way that it reads it's as if maybe Paul was being criticized that he's preaching to gain followers am I preaching just to gain followers am I doing this just to have a crowd am I doing this just to please men and he's saying no because if I did it just to please men I'm a man's servant and I wouldn't be a servant of Christ so we strive for biblical Excellence as a church as families as individuals not to impress people not to impress the people who are looking in not to impress the crowd that would come to our website or impress those that would stream our services we don't aspire to achieve anything that we might give an image that men would be impressed with but our we strive for perfection in the script we trive to be strive to biblical families and have the Excellence of the word of God to please God that's what we desire to do if we make our decisions whether it be certain standards or promote certain ideals or do certain things for the eyes of men or the way that people are looking at us then we become their prisoners what's so and so going to think what's so and so going to think and as I was by Pastor brother Barry coffee in the time that we were able to spend there over the past year some of the best Council he's just counseling us through this transition and this process was that he identified you that this instinct to think about to worry too much about what other people think and it mattering too much and because it matters it has weight to it it has Force to it and it was shared this with me and it became very very impactful for me because I realize if I was ever going to follow in the vision that God had for me if I was ever going to do the things that God wanted me to do I had to stop let in what everybody else would think or the the ideas I put in their minds even if they didn't have the thoughts I'm thinking them for them it couldn't matter it's okay to care but it can't matter know it can't change your decision what other people think should not influence you to be more holy what God thinks should influence you to be more holy do we just please men do we just try to please the world we try to make it palpable for Sinners to come no we want to please God and in the pleasing of God Christ is promoted and it'll draw all men unto him our goal is Harmony and love in our marriage and in our families from the inside from from something deep within us not this it something that's unfiltered it's going to come real it's going to be genuine it's going to be authentic I don't want to just create a facade I don't want to create a perfect instagrammable moment I want to be real before God I want to please God am here's a scripture that might seem odd to use in this place and I I I I realize it's a very very very lengthy sermon on a Wednesday night but in 1 Peter chapter 3: 3 and 4 he says this and it's speaking to women and how they would present themselves let your let your beauty your adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel he says but let it be the hidden man in the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price that's something a picture won't convey there's all sorts of ways that you could try to present yourself as beautiful and as elegant as the scripture is saying that beauty is vain and this Grace this charm this Elegance is deceitful but this meek and quiet Spirit you can't achieve it with the filter you can't achieve it with the picture and what Peter's doing is he's not giv a strict uh prohibition on the platting of hair or wearing of jewelry or wearing certain in the Peril but he's cautioning against being consumed by how you look outwardly this is certainly instructive to sisters and how they would dress themselves and brothers likewise how consumed we can get with how we look and the type of clothes we buy and the brand loyalty that we might have but he's dealing with the being consumed with the outward appearance when what we ought to be more concerned about is what's internally happening the right kind of attitude the right kind of character the right kind of inward work Let It Be the hidden man of the Heart Lord let us be responsible for what the inside is let us create the right promote the right kind of things in our family let us have the right kind of spirit the right kind of attit towards each other let us in your sight oh God be pleasing let what we have in our hearts and the aspirations we have let it be pleasing in your sight let us have a Family Vision to please you not men it would be a lot easier a lot easier just to put on a facade and live a lie in the few instances that we have together together but that's not what we're trying to do is Trick you when we have you over for dinner into thinking that life is perfect but what we want to do is live a life that's pleasing before God to be real in his sight to be honest before him not to persuade men but to please God musicians if you would come please I want my life to be a song to him with no autotune I don't want to be manufactured I want it to be real I want it to be genuine and my whole burden tonight I thought it would be very short and just very quick and to the point but my whole burden is just to convey convey a thought and a feeling that the word presents a picture of perfection but let's not make it carnal let's not make it humanistic let's consider the origin of the one who's making who's requiring it of us who is the one that ask of us to do certain things it's the Lord by whose power do we want to accomplish it by his it's so beautiful in the scripture some of the plainest language we have of the standard that we should carry within our hearts as Jesus says be ye therefore perfect Matthew 5:48 be perfect no wiggle room there right well be perfect in the Greek perfect means average nope not true we're told be ye therefore perfect but Jesus uses a language that both challenges us and then in the same way encourages us be therefore perfect as who your heavenly father which is in heaven is perfect he doesn't leave it without context well you just need to be perfect he says be therefore perfect even as the one that births you and nurtures you is perfect so then I can yield to a process as a Son of God I can yield to a promise as a daughter of God to say Lord I am being challenged by the word to be perfect but it's not disassociated from life it's not disassociated from seed it's not disass iated from power but I'm to be perfect as my heavenly father is perfect that means I've got the DNA of perfection within me the nature of perfection is there and that if I yield to the perfect nurture of the Holy Ghost then whatever the image of perfection is for me I know that you can achieve it and remember in the very very end last time as we read that statement about a true family and loving one another and being in harmony brother man said it's a picture of redemption it's always about Redemption so let's strive not to see ourselves as buzzards when it comes to the word of God strive not to see ourselves as those that are lacking well I don't have family I don't have this my marriage is broken this happened that happened listen we're not looking at all those things we're looking at the promise of God that says he is with you will never leave you nor forsake you and we use whatever principle it may be that's expressed in the word of God to be challenged by it and say Lord I want to become more like you there's so many ways we can express Express Christlike virtue even if we remain single the rest of our lives so many ways we can express Christlike virtue within a family setting even if we never have children there's so many ways that Christ can have prence without trying to fit ourselves in a particular mold well the family is husband and wife with two and a half children a white picket fence and a and all no no no no no no no it's not the carnal things it's the spiritual things that's what we're trying to promote that's what we're wanting to point you to is not comparison not competition but Christ that's where you'll be happy is when you know Christ is pleased I remember it's always a work in progress so no matter where you're starting now you know that just by little and little I want the Lord to do a work in my life as an individual as a man as a as a husband as a wife as a father as a mother as a friend as a brother as a sister as a member of a local body Lord just do do your will in me Lord let's stand [Music] let's bow our [Music] heads our gracious heavenly father as we close our service tonight I thank you for a a congregation that is so hungry for your word and so attentive and Lord their understanding and forgiving and Lord the Liberties that I take father may they never be displeasing to you or frustrating to them in the breath of this sermon tonight we're delivering a burden that I felt should be expressed at the outset a good place to start at the beginning of the year that regardless of what would be taught regardless of what subject matter we might approach that we should never let carnality intervene never let personality grab a hold of a scriptural precept and perverted so father as it is in my heart and the burden that I have to speak on relationships whether it be in the church or family the interactions with each other Lord continuing on the subject of who is my neighbor in so many ways just to deliver some Grace tonight that we do not want to present to the people an unrealistic picture of what their lives should have been what their lives ought to be and what they already know it isn't but be honest with ourselves that marriages can be difficult relationships can have ups and downs and weak moments there can be even separations and rejoining Lord there's so many different things that if we let condemnation take a hold of it carnality take a hold of it then all of a sudden there's this image of what a perfect family looks like and we realize there's no way we could ever be that whether it be history or just fact Lord of loss of loved ones and separations and so many different factors Lord Lord we can never be in that image Lord let us lay aside the filtered picture let us lay aside the carnal representation of what a family should look like and let's just let you paint the picture we want you to start with us tonight Lord begin with me oh Lord I think I think how many times a family photo is ruined because everyone at the same time looks at the one kid and says smile and when he finally does everyone's looking down at the kid and what happened is everyone was so worried about that one person's part they didn't do their part Lord let me take my position let me take my stand let me do my part Lord I could do my part makes their parts easier to do it'll let your picture that's being painted come out right so I pray Grace upon the people tonight A Grace to apprehend the things which have been shared a Grace to internalize them appropriately a Grace to receive them to understand them and a Grace to live it we commit the people to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
