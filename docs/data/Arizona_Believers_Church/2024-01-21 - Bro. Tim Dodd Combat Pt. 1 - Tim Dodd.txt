TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now we're living in times that we see many things unfolding in the world that perhaps create questions in our mind of exactly how much time we have left on the face of the Earth we see a nation like Israel in the midst of a struggle and in a battle against their enemies we see demon forces being loosed and and you know people might have their opinion of what happened uh there in Israel a little over 100 days ago and the the evil events that unfolded but let me say this about it that the reason that they were caught off guard is because they don't have a prophet they didn't have eyes to see what was about to unfold in their midst they didn't have someone to warn them of events and and show exactly uh what they ought to be doing they're instead of relying upon education relying upon military relying upon all of these things which will fail the the Mad of the intelligence agency might be a the one of the greatest intelligence agencies in the world but nevertheless they failed you know all of those things God is the one that orchestrates events God is the one that allows events God is the one that oversees events and he reveals them to whom he will and we had a prophet messenger in this hour that came to uh advise or to declare to the Bride of Jesus Christ exactly what day we're living in exactly what we would need in this day that he would show us how God is moving because in the in the opening of the word and in the lamb taking the book we would not know that the lamb took the book unless there was a prophet that could what had eyes to see that could declare to us that the lamb has taken the book that the seals have been opened that the mystery has been unveiled so these are all integral parts of what God is doing and we're in the middle of end time unfolding events a and we see now Israel as a nation now we're privileged because we can look back because of the word of God and we can see Israel coming out of Egypt we can see Israel going through the Wilderness we can see God establishing Worship in the nation of Israel and we know the Old Testament is Shadows of and types of greater things to come we know the Book of Revelation where we read is a book of symbols I always Marvel at at this scripture because John saw 24 seats and 24 Elders who were the 24 Elders they were the 12 patri rars of the Old Testament and the 12 apostles is that right well John is one of those 12 so he sees 24 Elders of which he is one of them but he's in a vision and he's saying things it's not an unfolding event it's a vision that's declaring by symbols things that we can catch and things that we can understand but here we are today this is reality and all of these things are not intellectual understanding but they're to bring us into the thinking of God into the thoughts of God when we pray we don't pray to change God's mind we pray Lord not our will but your will be done we pray Lord show us your will lead us in the path of righteousness give us the right answer give us the right decision give us the right action to take in any situation that's our desire as Believers we don't want to to to mold God into our thinking but we want God to mold our thinking into his thoughts and and to give us an expression of his nature and now I want to just take this thing this what we're looking at in Revelation chapter 4 because this is J as it's shown to John in a symbol form now it was also shown to Ezekiel in the Book of Ezekiel you'll find a description of many of the same things but now if you go back into the Old Testament we find that Moses saw this pattern in heaven and was told to to form or make the Tabernacle and array the children of Israel according as it was shown to him in Heaven All right so he could not miss the pattern so he Moses went up on the mountain saw those things and came and made the representation of them in the earth now I want to spend a few moments here if it's all right with you and I hope you don't mind if I use some quotations here significantly in my slides because I I want to just take you quickly through the things that the prophet of God said in the fifth seal regarding these things so that we can see how they apply in the day and the hour we're living in so if you would put the slides up for me and we'll begin uh this morning now I want to entitle this message this morning combat simply combat now in the fifth seal thank you in the fifth seal we find out he says we find out in the church ages that those four beasts which we read about four powers was gathered around the Acts of the Apostles just the way that the Tabernacle in the wilderness so according to what Moses arrayed in in the wilderness was also what the four gospels were gathered around the Acts of the Apostles in the new test all right so we see this pattern repeating itself he says they were watching over this the lamb and the word to perform the word just as they did the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in the wilderness and so forth now the and so forth means the rest of the of the Tabernacle the way that it was made in the wilderness and he says now notice that even the nature of the Beast was exactly a tribal emblem so he's referring to the man uh the lion the ox the man and the eagle those were emblems that were represented there in the wilderness so let's just take a little bit of a look I have a just a few Graphics if they'll work for me this morning I see somebody's controlling the who's controlling this thank you I'll when I point at you I want you to move forward all right got it all right cuz the clicker here is not uh is made by man let's put it that way all right so now here we have a representation of the Tabernacle in the wilderness and some of some tents around it representing the children of Israel as they're gathered around the Tabernacle now remember when Moses made the Tabernacle they came out of Egypt as a I won't say unruly but a disorganized bunch and so they were just a group of people so that when Moses took and and uh uh built the Tabernacle through gifted men in the body then then they he he began to erect it outside of the camp because that what he was doing is he was reorganizing or or placing the people in their position around the word of God and so as he he first put erected this Tabernacle and then he placed the tribes around it which as you see thank you now let's take a little bit of an overview here and we see the Tabernacle we see I'll point to this one here we see the holy of holies we see the holy place and we see the outer court it's a representation of the human body which is the real Dwelling Place of God we have the the body the spirit and the soul is where God dwells when you're born again of the spirit of God he takes up his residency he puts a part of himself in your soul Quicken the seed Gene that's within you and making you uh now a god natured individual whereas before you were an unbelief natured individual all right so now we see I won't go into all of the different aspects of of what we see represented here but you can give me the next slide as we kind of zoom out and and place it there in the middle of the camp and so we see the 12 tribes of Israel that are gathered around the Tabernacle on in the outer perimeter here and then we see the the what would I call them segments or portions of the Le Levites that are camped next to the Tabernacle and then actually Moses and Aaron their encampment would be here and so we these are the tribes and these tribes Ephraim Dan Judah and Reuben they are the ones that have the emblems that brother brandham was talking about the lion the ox the man and and the eagle and so we see that these are these are specifically ordered God doesn't make mistakes and so he he put these tribes all in order he gave Moses the pattern Moses told people this is where you're going to dwell it was a representation that in the promised land you will have a specific placing all right it wasn't to stop here it was it wasn't just to be a Tabernacle in the wilderness we know that it would become the temple in the promised land and was mentioning to Aaron Brother Aaron and I were talking this morning he says he's already been ministering on the Tabernacle this year so you've already have some of the background so this is the encampment but there's a reason the reason that all of these tribes were around here with their emblems was to protect the word the reason that these these emblems which represented the anointings in Revelation CH 4 they are powers to protect the word the word in The Believer the word that dwell in your soul so there are anointings that are sent at specific times in the tribe of is in the nation of Israel we see all Fuller anointings at the same time like is seen in heaven but in the seven Church ages the four anointings are are sent into the church at different times all right give me the next slide in the fifth seal brother Brown says now we see the devil changing four beasts meant what power he revealed to the world and how they ended on this pale death horse now let's look at God's power of these beasts to combat them and that's why I entitled it combat now brother bram's uh describing here without going into detail uh or without going into a longer quote he's describing the four powers of the devil which are revealed in the opening of the first four seals the the white horse rider the red horse rider the black horse rider and the pale horse rider the power is the horse the rider is the same all right it's the same individual riding on you can give me the next slide so we have a little bit of a visual representation here we see a right white horse rider with some symbols he's got a bow but he's got no arrows he's got a crown now that and then and after that it moves to a red horse same guy now moving onto red horse a sword is given to take peace from the Earth and to slay and then the black horse comes with a a pair of balances in his hands and then the Pale Horse comes and his name is death and Hell follows after him and so we see this same Rider switching positions or switching the power depending on the age that we're living in all right next one brother Bram says when that Antichrist was riding with his false teaching now those are symbols this is not physical Warfare this is spiritual warfare the Antichrist was riding with his false teaching God sent his teaching out the word so here's the combat now the Antichrist comes with his power anointed false teaching God sends his power anointed true teaching of the word of God into the age to combat the move movement of the Antichrist spirit in that age and he's talking about the first Age The Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to manifest himself which is the word now before we go further I I want you to I want you to notice something here the Tabernacle in the wilderness representing the Believers when when the Devil comes to attack the word he's not trying to attack the message right he's trying to attack the word in The Believer and the and the anointing is sent upon the believer now there's a there's a a misunderstanding we won't turn to it but you can I think you know the scripture in Acts chap chap 1 and: 8 Jesus said to the church before they receive the Holy Ghost he says you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth now the power that Jesus was referring to is those four anointings Around The Throne a lot of times and I was raised in the Pentecostal movement I as a boy I was grew up in the Pentecostal church and we used to sing a song it's the Holy Ghost and power and it's keeping me alive anybody ever heard that song all right maybe we still sing it but the power was ambiguous it's the Holy Ghost and power you'll get power when you get the Holy Ghost no the power that you get as you'll see as we quote brother brandham here is the anointing that is sent upon the church to combat the Antichrist Spirit that's the power and you can only operate under that power that's the power that defeats the enemy it's not just oh I got the Holy Ghost I got power now well if you got power you got the anointing that was sent into that age so they he brother brandham says when the Antichrist was writing on his power God sent his power the lion of the tribe of Judah into that first age give me the next quote that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was the Living Word in the form of the Lion of the tribe of Judah riding out to combat that amen now you got it he sends his power Antichrist God sends his the word so the anointing comes to the word for the age all right I think the next one is graphical yes so if we lay this out now on a on a screen we see the Antichrist is coming to attack and depending on what uh Power the enemy is riding in is what power of the word he is confronted with so the White Horse is confronted with the lion anointing the red horse is confronted with the ox anointing the black horse of power of the enemy is confronted by the man anointing and The Pale Horse in the last days is confronted by the eagle anointing in other words if you want power in this hour this is the power yes you shall receive power see the Holy Ghost baptism that's one thing that I think sometimes people lose sight of is brother Brown says we've been in the Feast of Pentecost which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost from Acts chapter 2 until the present time the Holy Ghost was sent into the church in Acts chapter 2 and many times brother Brown was confronting different Brothers that said well that was just for the apostles that was just for them in that day he says I'll show you where God sent it into the church you show me where God took it out of the church the Holy Ghost the New Birth has been the same down Through the Ages so now let me just lay a principle here now in that the power of the Holy Ghost that was in Paul is the same power of the Holy Ghost in you all right the same power of the Holy Ghost in Luther the same power of the Holy Ghost in Wesley he said oh is that so well why are the actions different well get into to that but I want you to realize that the power of the Holy Spirit brother brandham says if you got the Holy Ghost you got enough power in you to speak worlds into existence and go and live on them but that power is limited by a law and it's not a law of dos and don'ts it's a law of Faith as much as God will reveal to you is as much of that power that is released unto you all right so it takes a revelation to loose the power of the Holy Ghost within the believer you don't have any less than you than you than you a sister doesn't have any less than a brother you know a pastor doesn't have any more than the church it's all the same Holy Ghost because if God is infinite the portion that's in you is infinite there's nothing in you that cannot be done save for one thing Revelation see that's why that that that God did not reveal the revelation of the rapture until this day because the power of the Rapture which is also the power of the Resurrection has been in the church since Acts chapter 2 the Power of the Resurrection The Power of the Rapture has been in the church but there would come a day that the revelation of the Rapture would be given or in other words rapturing Faith the power for the Rapture has always been in the church otherwise when how are they going to come out of the Grave the power of the Resurrection is already in them but in the last day days the revelation will be given to bring the church Faith into a level to loose that power that's in the church and bring forth a change of these mortal bodies isn't that wonderful it's simple that's how God operates all right so here we have just a a little bit different perspective we see you know the the devil wants to get to where the word is which is in you but he has to go through those anointings and he can't do it because they are sent to protect the word in you amen thank you next one we'll just go through a few more here all right let me just you can just blank that for a minute here for me I want to just lay a couple more things in here before you before we go there you know the scripture says brother brandham says that God sent his beast in his own mask to announce the combat to the Antichrist he says the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it all right and that's you've got to understand you've got to see when I say understand is to see you've got to see the standard for your age and the time that you're living in the power that is sent into the church is to combat the enemy 2 Corinthians 10 says though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations amen and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now let me just stop here for a moment you we know if you're sick according to the word of God you're already healed 2,000 years ago what's the problem the battle is in your mind it's your imaginations it's the high things that exalts itself against the word of God the word of God says we're already healed but the devil with an antichrist anointing comes to you and say well you can't be healed because of this or because of that and even because as Believers we hear a lot of things as well you know this can hinder you from your healing or that can hinder you from your healing you know if you've got something against you just repent of it just get it right get it under the blood and let the promise of healing take place in your life it's the same with any other thing you got any other situation any other problem you just trust God that's why brother brandham says the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass it's the mental attitude that the word comes to bring your thoughts in line with his word because his word is eternal and his word cannot fail amen God does not make mistakes as I already said God's word is true it will come to pass exactly like he said and all we have to do is get our thoughts in line with the word of God let the Holy Spirit bring our thoughts into captivity so the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal that is to say I don't Paul's not saying carnal as in unbelieving he's saying carnal as in natural okay so the weapons of our Warfare are not natural that is to say and it's not that these things are wrong it's not laying on of hands very good but it's your faith in the promise of the word of God all right it's not you know some kind of outside touch you know you can ask your pastor to pray for you anoint you with oil that's in the word of God but if you don't believe that physical action will do nothing for you all right we could say the same about water baptism we know that the water availeth nothing it's not the water that's going to wash you of your sins it's your faith in the word of God your re the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's your faith and I I preached on it a while ago at home I says it's very simple why you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't believe oh well brother Tim I I I thought if somebody laid hands on me or somebody prayed for me if I prayed all night if I did this and I did that no no no G the brother brandham explains how that Abraham you know believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness and God gave him the sign of circumcision a type of the Holy Ghost all right so what was what was wrong is that he what was I should say right is that he believed God God recognized his faith and accounted it to him for righteousness not anything he did amen God saw God spoke his word to Abraham Abraham believed God and God gave him righteousness and said now circumcise your household as a type of the Holy Ghost and that's the reality when you believe God God recognizes your faith and sends down the Holy Ghost as a seal of that faith I I try to not to you know sometimes emotional people need to get emotional right sometimes people that are that are deep thinkers need to understand a little bit better sometimes you know people that you know are religious want to have some kind of religiosity in it and God allows that God God makes room for your weaknesses to bring you into the place that he wants you to be in but the ultimate thing is he puts his life in you and it changes your nature and you're not the same anymore amen all right we go back to the slides now the second beast that the Antichrist sent out was a red Beast that he rode on was to take peace from the earth and War now the second one that went to combat him was the ox Beast now we're we're talking about these anointings or Powers upon the church the ox means a labor a beast of burden all right now we understand what this uh represents here because um we we can look back in history all right let's go to the next part he says see that shows that the thyra age after the Antichrist got settled down and it come into the thyra age the little church could do nothing but just simply labor and another thing the ox is also a beast of sacrifice and they give their lives just as freely as they could give them all right remember I said and you shall receive power now in the first church age the ones that were hidden in the upper room the ones that didn't want to show their face to the Gentile or to the Jews when the Holy Ghost Came Upon them they came out of the upper room seemed like drunk men bold as lions the cowards now became lions and because they were Anointed with an anointing and they begin to declare Jesus Christ to the those that were gathered in Jerusalem 3,000 were converted in that day and even the the Apostle Peter who fled when Jesus was tried as they tried to accuse him of being one of Jesus disciples but now he was fearless and stood up and says these men are not drunk as you suppose and he declared unto them the glory that was fulfilled right in their midst this is that which the SP the prophet Joel had prophesied and this Jesus whom you crucified he's both Lord in Christ and he just declared the whole message to them Fearless standing amongst him and the people were pricked in their hearts and said what should we do and he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ here's a man with the key ke of the Kingdom unlocking the door and he says be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the recipe hasn't changed all right the church got away from the recipe but the recipe hasn't changed now under this as the church changes or as the time changes or the age changes the Antichrist Spirit now changes couldn't defeat the lion anointing so he now he get the devil starts to ride on a different Power a red horse a sword was given unto him he was allowed to make war on the earth and take peace from the earth and and now you think oh well it's going to be a Warfare because there's a lion anointing but God changes the anointing the way to fight the red horse is not to be a lion the way to fight the red horse now is to be an ox is to be Anointed with a sacrificial anointing is to be Anointed with an anointing of service and so now but now let me H let me say if we didn't understand the anointings we might look at it and say what happened the cowards that became Lions did the Lions now become cowards right do they not got the Holy Ghost what happened they're not manifesting the same works that they did in the book of Acts hello what happened was the anointing changed those who previously fought against uh you know W out under that anointing to spread the gospel now under th tyan age they come under a different anointing and when the enemy comes at them and says you're a heretic we're going to burn you at the Stak and they go okay burn me at the steak then I will not re recant of what I believe I will stand for the truth if it cost me my life and they gave their lives willingly and they served God and they were under that anointing of that hour that beast of burden to and filled with the Holy Ghost absolutely filled with the Holy Ghost but a different Power you shall receive power after you receive the holy gohost now there might have been some of the early teachers of that age said what happened to the church where's the anointing we once had I can imagine them because the same in every age where's the anointing with what's head where's the boldness we once had what has happened what is all this people given their lives 66 million Martyrs at the at the the the false church and the Antichrist and all of these things happening what's wrong with us we need a Revival come on it's a different anointing now let's go to the next quote says the Martyr down Through the Ages there suffered terribly but what was they they was under the inspiration the spirit of God the power see a lot of times when we say power we think Warfare right this power made them beasts of sacrifice made them Believers of sacrifice and he says and don't forget this church and you Brethren on tape that's us I want you to examine this how could a man do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them and you shall receive power after that Holy Ghost has come upon you amen give me the next one all right the next that went out to combat or I'm sorry I'm in a oh I'm going to represent get put a box up here go when God if God sends a certain Spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by I'll say it again that's the only thing they can work by is the spirit that works among them well I thought it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Tim but the anointing upon the word is different to fulfill the purpose of God because you don't send the same anointing or the sunshine upon the stock as you do upon the grain the planting sun is weaker than the Harvest Sun it has to be a certain anointing to produce the results that are required in that season and so God sets up his work there and next one we will'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church responded to the anointing they couldn't do nothing else next one they didn't care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrifice labor and they walked up just as freely as they could walk Anointed with the true spirit of God of that age what did he just say the true spirit of God for that age well why did they act differently than Acts chapter 2 because they were Anointed with the true spirit of God for that age and they died like Heroes of sacrifice thousands times thousands 68 million of them on the records Ox sacrifice cuz that's what they were Anointed with amen good he says now no I'm just going to just leave it blank just for a moment there and I want to say something about this anointing as as they were Anointed with this and they suffered terribly with this under that anointing towards the end of that season was a man by the name of yan hus you ever heard of him John hus we might call him in English he was I think Dutch or something check thank you and uh oh that's why you you know him very well yes yes yes and uh so he was a real man of God matter of fact he was about a hundred years before Martin Luther and and so he's they they took him and and for what he was preaching they burned him at the stake and he willing gave his life and so now as he's standing there at the stake the fires are being lit and the Flames are upon him the spirit of God comes upon him to prophesy and he says you may be able to cook this and I have it here you you're going to burn a goose he said because hust means Goose okay you're going to burn a Goose but in 100 years you will have a swan that you can neither roast nor burn now the symbol the family emblem symbol of Luther's household was a swan there is coming a swan he says you won't be able to burn why not the anointing was about to change you see he spoke that in 1415 in 1515 exactly a 100 years later that was the year that a spiritually tormented monk by the name of Martin Luther frightened by God was assigned in his church to teach on the book of Romans and if you know anything about the book of Romans that's where it says and the just shall live by faith and Martin begin to catch a revelation why and and Martin was was taken uh you know we know that he posted his protest against the Catholic church and he he went to trial and and in the midst of that trial they excommunicated him and they they did more than excommunicated him they made him I think it's called Persona nrata or something and they they basically said this man can be killed by anyone who finds him anywhere they pronounced a sentence of death upon Martin Luther now Martin Luther what was his teachings Martin Luther himself said we are all hites he says in other words I'm teaching what John hus taught what John hus taught a 100 years ago I'm teaching today but why wasn't Martin Luther able to be burned at the stake because the anointing changed it was no longer an ox anointing upon the church but but now by the revealing of the word of God the anointing had come to prove that the just shall live by faith and Martin be to preach that anointed word and that anointed be to come on the church though they hunted him and they the his protector of that region hid him away for I think nine months while he interpreted the New Testament into the German language but after that he went out freely and and what we know is the Reformation began to break forth and the Supernatural begin to happen why because it was no longer an ox anointing there's nothing the devil could do about it Hallelujah the devil was now on a black horse but God sent forth the man anointing into the church no longer a sacrificial anointing but raised up a man with boldness like Martin Luther and the shrewdness of Martin Luther to stand there and say I will not recant I cannot recant this is the truth of the word of God he was anointed amen do you have the Holy Ghost absolutely well brother Timmy he drank beer he sure did because it wasn't revealed to him at that point in time there was many things that were not yet reveal God said I will restore sayith the Lord all that the Antichrist Spirit through the Dark Ages the canor and the Palm worm the caterpillar the Locust all that had eaten off the bride tree I will restore and this was the beginning of the restoration it wasn't the fullness of it it was the beginning of it and so that word went out and they were unable to do anything about Martin Luther why the anointing had changed you the church can only operate under the anointing it's given go ahead give me the he says the next thing that went out to combat that was a beast with the face of a man smart educated shrewd fine Anointed with the spirit of that day notice it go ahead notice idolatry brought the man Beast that the man Beast went forth with the power of God by the wisdom that God gave him and brought the church from idolatry back to God hallelujah under that third anointing came reformation and restoration it's amazing that the key Revelation to Quicken the church under the power of the Holy Ghost in that under that man anointing was not the godhead was not the godhead it was the just shall live by faith that was the spirit Came Upon the word and begin to reveal that it's the same thing that Yan hus preached 100 years earlier but now it begin to be loosed upon the people when God works in in a season I'll give you an example on the mission field when God works he has his Seasons that he works we have a a a work of God that's going on in Ethiopia and it has been for about 10 years and God has has re the word is the message is really now taking a grip in that country uh for several years I would go there and we might be able to gather 10 20 the fir I think the first time I went was probably 10 Believers there was a brother from Uganda that what we sent into the Ethiopia and he was a good evangelist and and and they then there was 20 Believers and then maybe 30 Believers and you know for a season but all of a sudden it begin to Break Forth as as the Ethiopians themselves begin to catch the word and God raised up ministry within that country now having looked back there were men from different countries that had tried to do something in Ethiopia and we weren't the first ones and so Brothers with a burden say what's happening in Ethiopia and they would go and they would they would preach the word and they would send messages and different things and nothing ever took root but for some reason last decade was started really in 2013 for some reason God chose that this was the time I can't say why I just know this was the time and now people begin to catch it the Ethiopians begin to catch it and they begin to take a hold of it and the and the 10 to to 20 the 20 to 30 the 30 to 70 the 70 to 100 so two years ago we had a convention and there was over a hundred people not all the Believers in Ethiopia about a 100 people last year we went again there was over 200 people next time we're Lord willing going back in may pray for us because we we try and just to have a just a general meeting for everybody and and the pastor the main Pastor there brother Mogan he says brother Tim maybe next year there'll be a thousand we don't know but it's just exploding across the country why God has a season we can't we can't question God God does things the way he does them amen are you with me on that all right so we find under the man anointing that's where we find uh Luther that's where we find Wesley and that's where we find find the Pentecostals Luther brought under that anointing the church out of idolatry under a move of God that started to deliver them from the Catholic man-made Creeds that had held them in bondage because remember if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got enough power in you to speak worlds into existence but it's limited to the faith that you have they had the Holy Ghost through every age even in the Dark Ages there was Holy Ghost filled believers but brother Bram says the Holy Spirit was bound by Creeds and dogmas so it's man-made teaching that limits the power of the Holy Ghost in The Believer okay so as the church begin to come out of that then then the Lutheran Church became uh uh formalized you could say and because God wasn't finished with just justification he raised up a man by the name of John Wesley you ever heard of John Wesley sure we've all heard of John Wesley he's a messenger to the to the Phil Philadelphia Age and and brother randam says when the wlans come along with their Revival they said we don't need you lutherans anymore but did you know the very life that was in the blade made the tossle says it can go no further until it uses the blade because it's a pollen shakes off itself down into the blade and there brings forth an ear by and by an ear of corn comes out it has grains in it that was the Pentecostal the restoration of the gifts coming com back into the church that's still under the man anointing the restoration of the gifts coming back into the church now the ear can't look back and say tossel I have no need of you notice what brother Brown says so what he's saying he says justification comes into the church and it's always in the church then sanctification comes into the church under that anointing and it stays in the church it's still a Sanctified bride it's still a sanctified people then the gifts of the holy spirit are restored in the church and they stay in the church never did away with those nobody ever did away with those but the church moves on all right it's still there but there's more for the church than just that he says what is it he says it's God's Church further matured and all that is in it he says we can see these things now that the ears ripe ends at the time of the end oh I know we got a lot of fungus on the ear but it's still an ear just the same that's not me that's brother Brown saying that all right he says we have a lot of ins and outs and little isms but God will shave that all off some of these days hallelujah we're still these people right amen we're not perfect yet we're perfect in Christ as far as spotless or sinless in the blood of Jesus Christ but we're not perfect in our actions as a matter of fact you'll never be perfect in your actions until your body is changed the fullness of the adoption to it the Redemption of our mortal bodies that's what we all long for that's why you know I had a young brother travel with me one time to the men's meetings and he said brother Tim you know the body change must be more you know you must desire it more being older than I do as a young man I said my brother you don't understand the body change I said it's not age and and it's not that I'm getting old and tired that makes me want a body change but what it is is there's a life in me that cannot be fully expressed through this Mortal body that life longs to be loosed it that eternal life in me wasn't made to be limited to the the weakness of this Mortal body it was made to have an eternal body and one day Paul says this Mortal will put on immortality this corruption will put on incorruption then the life that's in me will be completely expressed without mistakes Hallelujah I don't know about you I'm looking forward to it because I believe what John Wesley said which I believe is still in the church is that you're as likely to make mistakes as you are to breathe amen so if you want to stop making mistakes stop breathing you won't make any more mistakes all right dead men make no mistakes dead men don't get angry dead men don't get upset what people say about them that's why we need to be dead in Christ amen all right so brother Brown says we have a lot of ins and out little isens but God will shave all that off one of these days and he will have a perfect ear of corn one of these days all right the same Holy Ghost oh sorry the same holy spirit that fell on Pentecost is bringing it all about the Holy Spirit has been in the church for 2,000 years working out his purpose to bring us to the full maturity that is the stature of a perfect man in every individual in the body in general and as long as we're still in these mortal bodies we'll always be in combat yes amen the spirit of God fighting against the spirit of the world or the Antichrist Spirit Hallelujah so we realize under the man anointing was when outward demonstrations begin to manifest was under the man anointing you could go back and look at the Shakers you know largely under the Methodist movement there are people that believed if you didn't shake you didn't have the Holy Ghost and that was their their their evidence they had shouting you know you had to shout it depend on how loud you shouted as to how much Holy Ghost you had there's people they believed in being slain in the spirit right back under the man anointing and that if if if that that was a real sign that the Holy Ghost was Among Us was that that uh uh we were slain in the spirit or or you know somebody laid their hands on us we fell down all of those kind of things that was back under the mount anointing right all right and so all of these things all these outward demonstrations we know the Pentecostals and the restoration of the gifts they begin to say well if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost that and don't get me wrong brother brandham said they had a real Pentecostal experience right but the anointing on that hour was the restoring of these things the man anointing bringing these things back into the church not that the church would be governed by them but the church would have access to all the promises of God just like we have justification just like we have sanctification we got the gifts of the Spirit anything that we have need of is in the body if it's in the word it's in the body all right and so uh there the Pentecostal begin to say well you got to speak in tongues you got to prophesy you got to interpret you got to do all those things and did all that that speak in tongues have it well brother brandham went to Mishawaka he says they had the Holy Ghost right and one man begin to speak in tongues and another man begin to interpret and he says it was exactly correct is that right he says now one man speaking in tongues he finally found him one day and he was talking to him he says that man was a real Christian he really had it he says but the then he ran into the other man that was doing the interpreting and he talked to that man and he found out that that man was a hypocrite is that right he says the man had a wife I think it was blond-headed and he was living with a blackheaded woman or vice versa in other words he was living in adultery and he had children of adultery and all of these things and so brother Bram thought well you know I thought I was amongst Angels but did I get amongst Devils you know he didn't understand what was going on but it was the anointing of the hour the rain falls on the just and the unjust all right and so they began to catch uh the the some of them now listen now this is important now to understand the anointing versus the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you still with me so far because brother bradam says about Believers and I now I don't have these notes in front of me I'm just going to just lay this out so we're all on the same page pertaining to the baptism of the Holy Ghost the we know the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you all right it's the quickening of the sea Gene it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul realm that changes your nature he says but now if you do something wrong he says the anointing will leave you like a dove and go sit on a branch somewhere now if you don't understand that the anointing is the power for the age you'll think you can lose the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't lose the baptism of the Holy Ghost see brother bandam says the dove won't stay upon a wolf nature and what the problem problem is is people don't understand they have two Natures they have the nature of God on the outside but they have the nature of the flesh or the nature of God on the inside the nature of the Flesh on the outside and if you get in the flesh the anointing will not operate Through Your fleshly Existence the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're sealed to the day of your Redemption but you start to act wrong you start to act contrary to the word God will not bless something that's contrary to the word but he says when you make that right then that anointing comes back upon you the dove can come back and that brings the power of God into our life power for what to be witnesses that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever am hallelujah amen aren't you glad for that I'm glad for this message that teaches us those things it's not a mystery it's a reality how you know cuz if you don't understand that I'll tell you what exactly is going to happen to you when you make a mistake in life and you feel like God Is A Million Miles Away the devil's going to come to you say see you never had it you never really were born again how could you make a mistake like that and be you know you might say some cross word to your spouse or you might you know make some mistake at work or something or get angry or something like that or or a lot of times the devil will just bring you into a place where you're going to see or hear something that will grieve you and will grieve the Holy Spirit and you'll you'll you'll think to yourself how can I ever get into such a situation and have the Holy Ghost and that's exactly what the devil wants you to think but what God wants you to do is just repent of it repent of it every day that's why that's why even in the in the book of Acts we find in Acts chapter 4 I believe it is or Acts chapter 3 you know after the after Peter and John were loosed from prison you know they begin to rejoice and shout and they had a service and the Bible says the house they were in was shaken and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost now they were already filled with the Holy Ghost they were already born again in Acts chapter 2 but they were all the disciples everybody was filled with the Holy Ghost again what was that a fresh anointing a fresh outpouring a washing of the water of the word an expression of God to cleanse because we rub shoulders with unclean things every day right and as we walk in the world we hear music I I'll tell and the devil SWS things in our minds that we don't even realize I might have told the story last time I was here I going to tell it again I I was you know sleeping one night and I I began to dream that I was counseling somebody and I was counseling I think it was a couple and and I I begin to say to them you know I see what the problem here is that you need love you really need love in your relationship all you you need is love all you need is love all and I woke up and now you have to understand for those of you that don't know that was a Beetles song all right and I woke up and I was so grieved how could that happen in my dream I thought what is wrong with me I am so carnal now I was never a Beatles fan you got understand I never was into their music and so I thought to myself how did that get into my subconscious H how did it get there and I was several days pondering that Lord how did that get inside of me and one day I was looking on my tablet at a news article and when the before the news article came on an advertisement came on and it was an advertisement brother Aaron will give me a rough time over this for Blackberry wow okay and the background music was that song and so the devil through that advertisement seed that into my subconscious without me even realizing it see that's why you have to watch what you look at watch what you listen to all of these things because the devil has access to your mind he doesn't have access to your soul if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost he has access to your mind and you need to keep those things away to keep the battle on the Winning Side on the Lord's Side and so once I realized what it was I said oh Lord forgive me the devil was subtle on that one and and it didn't bother me no more cuz I realized how the devil got it in there it wasn't in me it was the devil that put it in my mind and at the appropriate time anointed it dreams sometimes they're crazy and you don't we don't live by dreams all right now brother Bram says in Christ revealed in his own word he says down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went into the ground the complete seed all right that's the first age under the lion anointing then it comes out through the feet Luther comes back out then through Wesley then into the pentec Apostles the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that cuz that's the last thing there is all right so now let me stop here for a moment Luther Luther Wesley Pentecostals are all under the man anointing the last thing that there is is for Christ himself now to come and step into the image amen a furtherance from Luther Wesley and Pentecostal he goes on he says the next is the intelligence we have no intelligence of our own it's his the mind of Christ now people will will misplace quotes and say well people are just into intelligence or they're just into intellectual thinking that's not what brother Brown's saying here brother Brown's saying the very mind of Christ comes into the church she will have the word and know what he wants done with it amen it's the bride that receives the word in her day not doing away with any of those former things that were restored in the church but now a furtherance of it he says we have no sight of our own how can we for how can a man foresee things he can't do that it's God himself it's coming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through and then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning amen now we come back to what was in the Garden of Eden we're going to get into that more tonight because that's the hour that we're living in we're come back into that fullness of the relationship with Christ like Adam and Eve had in the Garden of Eden a perfect Faith a perfect love a perfect walk with God Amen all of nature subject to the manifestation of the sons of God we come now to that in this hour that's that's beyond Luther Wesley and Pentecost but includes what Luther Wesley and Pentecost had but if you don't miss the ne or that if you miss the next step you're actually not walking under the anointing of this hour you're trying to be under the anointing of a previous age Lord help us amen he said now do I still have another quote I think I do he says then at the last power he brings down the eagle to restore the children back to the original faith of the fathers again notice the Antichrist was on a pale horse mixed color he says a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up it's politics it's natural National Powers its religious Powers its demonic Powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a mixed Pale Horse he's got all kinds of powers so the Pale Horse is riding out with his powers but the anointing against the devil see that's why it's such a confusing age we're living in brother Bram says here's what the anointing the devil is using the power the devil is using he says it's politics it's National Powers it's religious Powers it's demon powers it's all kinds of powers all mixed together and it's hard to single out and say well this is this kind of a demon and that's that kind of a demon no we see it in the media we see it in the schools we see it in the culture we see it in the supermarket we hear it on the radios I'll tell you what the devil wants to send his powers to you through social media wants to bombard you every day that somebody that's got a spirit on them is going to do a certain something and you're going to look at that and go oh that's terrible well why are you looking at it just get away from it walk with Christ because the bride is to come up higher amen it's not it's not a a a man age where we're trying by shrewdness to accomplish something we now come to the eagle anointing all right we it it it wasn't clear then but now as we see it all around us the one thing that you need to see is the anointing that you need to be under there's only only one remedy and that is the original Power that fell at Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 is still in the church and the power which has gone from Lion to Ox to man now has become in an eagle form and brought the church to a higher place than was ever known all right thank you you can take that down now I want you to I want to show you something here brother brandham as he's explaining these in in the seals and he's showing the different anointings and around the throne and how they combat the Antichrist Spirit brother brandham could look back in history and say this is how the lion acted how the how the people acted under Theon under the lion anointing in their age is that right all right then he could look back through the Dark Age and say This Is How They responded to the anointing in their age you see that's why brother Bram says the anointings is not emotions it's not running around the church and and and doing all kinds of of things like that and all emotions and things like that he says a matter of fact he says Jesus in Luke chapter 4 with the greatest anointing that was upon him he after he read the scripture saying the spirit of the Lord is upon me he sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth those weren't intellectual words Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life and brother brand says the anointing is not emotions but the anointing is supreme power in in control knowing what and how amen amen it's a revelation that's imparted in the church to loose the power of the Holy Spirit to show you who you are to show you what lays within you that you might declare the glory of God in your life now brother bradam could look back in history and explain the the man anointing the lion anointing the ox anointing but he could not look back in history and explain the eagle anointing right cuz it wasn't history brother Bram said in the Easter seal the eagle anointing flew out in the opening of the seals it was the opening of the seals that loosed the eagle anointing upon the church so now that's why brother Bram couldn't explain in the seals what the eagle anointing did cuz it was only just then released and it was now going to produce in the church what had never been produced before what had never been produced before amen all of those Restorations and things they're part of the church but that's not the eagle anointing that's the man anointing and so the explanation of the eagle anointing and what it is to accomplish is in the messages that follows the seals because now under that anointing as brother brandham said when the seals open the Bible became a new book to me and he began to preach the word of God under the inspiration that was given for you and for me not doing away with the messages that were before the seals they were legitimate Holy Ghost messages sent into the church to cap off the restoration and Reformation period but that ended at the opening of the seals to bring the church into the very mind of Christ as Christ now is revealed himself he's saying to his Prophet he's saying to the church come up higher the breach between the church ages in the seals a door was opened in heaven now it's now it's come to give you a different perspective because if you realize what happens under the eagle anointing what's takes place the man anointing the lion anointing the ox anointing were all Earthbound creatures but now the eagle yes sees it differently he rises above it all you know the lion can't see the forest for the trees you know the ox can't see anywhere past the field he's in the man he sees the buildings but he can't see what's behind the buildings but the eagle rises above it all and sees the oh my sees the Eternal purpose of God in a three-fold manner that was unveiled in the opening of the seventh seal to bring the true revelation of the believer into the believer to lose the entire power of the Holy Ghost listen the entire power of the Holy Ghost isn't about just going to church and shouting and jumping and doing all those kind of things now if you want to go to church and shout and jump and and have gifts of the Spirit and all that go for it praise the Lord those things are in the body but that's not the eagle anointing hallelujah praise the Lord you still with me or you want to throw me out all right Hallelujah now when we look back in the Old Testament Abraham Moses Ezekiel Jacob Daniel all of these brothers when they looked at Christ now remember the new birth is a divine revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you when they looked at Christ they all saw something different but it was the same one that's why brother brand says when when Jesus went into Paradise to empty it out and knocked at the door and he says and there there's Abraham and Sarah there he is melkisedek the one we met on the plains of memmory the one that gave me strength to Bear seed here he is there was Daniel was looking at and say oh there he is the Ancient of Days right there he is there's Ezekiel saying there he is the wheel within the wheel right Oh my he they all knew him there Moses saw him oh the one I saw is hind Parts but now I see him face to face hallelujah oh everybody recognizing this is the one I met this is the one I was telling you about they might have been there hundreds of years discussing how God revealed himself to them but now when he come into their midst they all of a sudden realize he's the same one right it was a different manifestation God and morphe representing himself in every age but he's the same one he has the same power he has the same promises the same one that promised to Abraham that he would rise again to Joe that in my flesh I shall see God that that to Moses to to Joseph don't bury me here in Egypt take me back to the promised land all of the Revelation that was in their heart now they're standing in his presence in the Fulfillment of their expectation and there'll be a people in the last days that have an expectation for the body change Amen brother Ram talks about he says you might have come out of Methodist you might have come out of Baptist you might have come out of different groups with different ideas but as the word becomes real to you and the power of God is loosed in your life listen I came out of Pentecostalism I went to Bible school for four days my niece asked me why didn't you go any longer I says I didn't find what I was looking for she said says what were you looking for I said God even before I had the message I knew God wasn't there praise the Lord by Grace is right we thank God for his mercies in our lives that we don't get scrupled up with all kinds of men's ideas and as God takes his word and washes Us in the water of the word how many of you know him better today than you did when you were first Saved yes we all do praise the Lord why because he's continually revealing himself we we're birth then potentially all the power laid in us at the new birth but it can only be loosed by the Revelation that is deposited in your life because the power is limited to the Revelation i' go a step further and say the Revelation is limited to the character right that's why there's a molding process of our character you don't receive the character of Christ when you're born again because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a gift but character is a victory Hallelujah you with me all right brother Brown says in things that are to be one of his last messages he says sorry I need to just check while I'm close to closing time here he says you see the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation Jesus said in Matthew the 16th chapter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you what is it a revelation of who he was he says Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour right what he was now he says the great church that he established on the day of Pentecost by the sending of the Holy Ghost had to suffer martyrdom go into the dirt into the Earth in the Dark Age to bring forth again in the age of Luther and come on out to the full statue of the Bride of Jesus Christ in this last day Hallelujah rising of the Sun you know the revelation of Jesus in you the revelation of Jesus Christ to you but now listen what is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you he says in Rising of the sun he says I want to just catch the context here when Peter told him Thou Art the Christ the son of God he said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah's Flesh and Blood never this revealed this to you but my Father which in heaven has revealed Upon This Rock I'll build my church Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it I give you the keys whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth so forth then he says that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh it was flesh in that day by the son the groom it's a flesh today by the bride so what is the Revelation that God's getting in you it's your name on the Lamb's Book of Life what is the revealing of the son of man it's the revealing of your position in that book Because when John wept because nobody could open the book he wasn't weeping that for any other reason than the fact that he realized if nobody could open the book If nobody could break the seals if nobody could redeem the book then all Humanity was lost because the names of the elect are written on the book and if nobody could redeem the book then the elect were lost that's why the devil tries to attack the word because it's the Redemption of the attributes of God but now John was told don't weep John for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and John looked to see the lion and he saw the lamb as it had been slain he saw Christ a bleeding sacrifice and seeing Christ there a bleeding sacrifice take the book I'll tell you what John rejoiced all Heaven rejoiced the elders C Cast down their crowns they know this is what it's all about he has redeemed us from every Kindred tongue and Nation he has paid the price and now we can come back what we were meant to be we can hold in possession the title deed of our inheritance that Adam lost it's our hours Hallelujah he paid the price at Calvary was spending 2,000 years of intercession but in the last days he stepped forth to say it's yours amen we don't understand what that statement means do we when he says it's yours what he's what he's done now in the opening of the seals is to reveal the mysteries of the reality of who you are you're not Church you're bride all right start let's start there you're not just a sinner saved by grace you're an attribute that was in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world you always were in the mind of God he always loved you you're always a part of him you're an expression of God ordained to this age to manifest the word of this hour under the anointing of this hour amen I'm not living in the day of Pentecostal I'm not living in the day of Lutheran I'm not living in the day of weslan I'm not living under an ox anointing that's not my anointing I'm not even living under a lion anointing I'm living under the anointing of the eagle yes sir Hallelujah I'll get right into tonight's message if I go any further but it's it's got to come to the fullness of the power to bring you to a revelation of what's written on that book because what's written on that book is the reality it's not only the reality of who you are it's the reality of who Paul was it's the reality of who John was it's the reality of who James was it's the reality they prob that Paul says now we look through a glass Darkly but then face to face we're beholding it as a mystery but then we shall know even as we are known then we shall see him as he is then we will recognize our position in Jesus Christ the devil when the bride recognizes who she is she will be an undefeatable army sometimes we leave these things out and say oh we need some carnal expression or some fleshly expression we Lord give me some kind of outward manifestation if that's what you need go for it go for it you want to see some kind it's all available to you right it's all there you want to speak in tongues I spoke in tongues you want to have interpretations I've had interpretations I've had dreams I've had Visions I've had all of these kind of things just personally and I'm not making anything out of myself I've seen God heal the sick I've seen God Ra the raise the dead I've seen all kinds of Supernatural thing I've seen God stop storms I've seen him stop storms just like that I've seen God do those things by the way I'm not stopping the rain in case you're wondering has to come you know brother Brown even said about the third P he says you'll notice it wasn't me it was him that told me to do it it's not in a man but it's God in the man and so all those things we've seen all those things but where does it come from it comes from the revelation of the word made flesh in me I'm not any more worthy than any of you I'm not any better than any of you I say it's all available to you and it's unlocked in the mystery of this message that's been revealed under an anointing that God has sent in this day to raise you up into a faith that is greater than the world has ever seen the only thing comparable would be the seed that went into the ground the Lord Jesus Christ himself it was the word made flesh in that day of the bridegroom now it's the word made flesh in this day by the bride let me give you a couple more quotes and then we close this is just a foundation for tonight's service I want to go there right now you know it's just throbbing in my heart he says an Easter seal he says every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the Pol religious power it went to meet the Roman power and then when it come to the sacrifice hour the ox went out because the sacrifice beasts to the Lord then come the reformers down through the church ages the face of a man than reformers have been since Luther Wesley Calvin on down Pentecostal age but in the last message that went forth there came a flying eagle it's Eagle time reveal time the word of God made manifest the word of God proved is it a public show on is the third pole a public show it's not a public show it's hidden is God revealed in glory and Majesty no he's revealed in Simplicity the glory and Majesty will be on the other side in this world it's God hidden in Simplicity and revealed in the same Saints don't try to make God into some kind of a public show don't do it he doesn't want to do it he wants to make himself known to you everything that you have need of is yours it all ultimately goes back to only beli if he'll reveal it to you accept what he'll reveal to you he says in the Rapture message also one of his last messages he says in Wesley's Age The Works that he did testified who he was in Luther's age on the Reformation I sure it testified who he was in the days of the Pentecostals the restoring back of the gifts the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues casting out Devils the gifts whyatt testified there was no joke about it and then when the bride is being called out yeah and then when the bride is being called out how you going to put it out it's a revelation of the manifestation of the word made true we're living in that day Hallelujah the revelation of the mystery of himself yes do you know what you have in your hand sometimes we get away from it the secrets young men The Secret of who you are the purpose of your life is contain is now revealed and contained within the revelation of this message the anointing of this hour is to put you in a mindset that Adam had before the fall to put you back in a place Romans 8 says the manifestation of the sons of God all creation groans for is to put your mind I'll prove it to you tonight but to put your mind back in the mindset that you understand that all of creation is subject to you then what about sickness yeah then what about needs then what about trials are listening to a message in the adoption Series today and brother Brown says you know sometimes we get as human beings we we we get these trials and it's hard to Bear up under them and and brother Brown says sometimes I pray and I say Lord take these things away from me and God says are you trying to run away from them I gave them to you for a purpose then brother Brown says then Lord help me bear up under it give me the strength in the midst of the trials to put my shoulders back and know who I am that I might be an overcomer in this age because to the Overcomer in this age I will grant what to sit with me in my Throne God's molding in us that kind of character that we might possess all that Adam lost let's bow our heads together let's stand
