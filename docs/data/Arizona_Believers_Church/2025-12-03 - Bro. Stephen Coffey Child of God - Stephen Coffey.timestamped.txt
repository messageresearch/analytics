[0:00] Galatians the 4th chapter
[0:04] starting in verse one.
[0:09] Now I say
[0:12] that the heir as long as he is a child
[0:16] defereth nothing from a servant, though
[0:19] he be the Lord of all, but is under
[0:22] tutors and governors until the time
[0:24] appointed of the Father. Even so we when
[0:28] we were children were in bondage under
[0:32] the elements of the world. But when the
[0:34] fullness of time was come, God sent
[0:37] forth his son made of a woman made under
[0:40] the law to redeem them that were under
[0:43] the law, that we might receive the
[0:45] adoption of sons.
[0:48] Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth
[0:52] the spirit of his son into your hearts,
[0:54] crying, Abba, Father.
[0:58] Wherefore thou art no more a servant,
[1:01] but a son.
[1:03] And if a son, then heir of God through
[1:07] Christ.
[1:09] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:10] word. You can be seated.
[1:15] Uh
[1:17] yeah, it's good to be here. I I I wanted
[1:19] to uh uh my my brother Andrew, I'm
[1:22] Andrew's brother in case you didn't
[1:24] know. And uh I know a lot of you, but
[1:26] not all of you. So I hope I hope we get
[1:27] to meet one another. But uh I was uh
[1:30] just thinking before the service and
[1:34] uh back there and I uh it it is so
[1:38] wonderful to be here with you tonight
[1:39] and and friends and family, but uh I'm
[1:43] I'm real honored to be here uh uh for
[1:48] brother Aaron and and I know he's sick
[1:50] and not feeling well. So I'm I'm really
[1:52] thankful that he gets time to rest. Uh
[1:54] pastors don't get a lot of time to rest.
[1:56] Uh, so I'm glad that he's resting and
[1:58] he's um he's not pushing himself and uh
[2:01] so I'm glad to do that. But you know, I
[2:03] have a an interesting perspective of
[2:05] brother Aaron.
[2:07] Uh we've known him, our family has known
[2:11] him for a long time. Andrew's been
[2:12] friends with him for a long time. But my
[2:15] first uh I was a little little boy when
[2:20] in in Dallas, Texas. First time I ever
[2:23] saw Brother Aaron. And um
[2:27] uh he comes through the front door and
[2:30] he has on a uh you know he looked real
[2:33] real sharp, real put together and he had
[2:35] a briefcase. I think he was still in law
[2:37] school if I'm not mistaken. And he comes
[2:39] through the door and I'm just a
[2:41] seven-year-old uh I don't even know how
[2:43] old I was. He was very very young, six,
[2:44] seven, eight. And just, you know, uh up
[2:47] to no good. And I was just looking at
[2:49] him, just looking at him up and down and
[2:50] I was like, "Wow, he's cool." And uh
[2:55] from that time on, since I was a young
[2:57] boy, I've been in in the front row
[2:59] looking up at brother Aaron, and I've
[3:01] seen um his his ministry grow all that
[3:05] time. And uh I I feel like I've had a a
[3:09] a front row seat. Uh and then now being
[3:12] here with you all is really special. Uh
[3:15] and I I think that's a testimony to what
[3:18] the Lord will do uh through an
[3:20] individual and that's a really special
[3:22] thing. So, I'm very honored to be here
[3:24] with you tonight and um I'm excited uh
[3:27] just to be able to share what's on my
[3:29] heart with you tonight. And I I love um
[3:32] I love Wednesday night service because
[3:36] we're all running on about 30% of our
[3:38] brain capacity. 30 25 35 uh% and we're
[3:43] we're tired. We've had a long a long
[3:45] week. Uh so if it's okay, I'll just be
[3:47] myself tonight and I just want to share
[3:49] something that has been pressing on my
[3:51] heart and uh I I've my heart has been at
[3:56] on on this passage of scripture I feel
[3:58] like the whole year and uh for whatever
[4:02] reason I I I've just been drawn to this
[4:04] passage. So if it's okay, let's just go
[4:06] through that tonight, Wednesday night.
[4:08] Let's relax, just enjoy being in the
[4:10] presence of the Lord and go through it
[4:12] together. Is that okay?
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I want to uh uh I
[4:17] want to just jump right in here
[4:21] and look at this passage. And if you
[4:24] have your Bibles, I want you to keep
[4:26] your finger there. I might jump to a few
[4:28] other scriptures here, but I I I want to
[4:31] just um dwell on this passage.
[4:36] And uh I was reading it even this
[4:39] morning and I I just think what a what a
[4:43] passage. What a what a string of
[4:46] statements uh that is being made here by
[4:49] Paul to the church at Galatian. Um
[4:53] I was thinking as as you as you're drawn
[4:55] to verse 7, wherefore thou art no more a
[4:59] servant but a son.
[5:01] And uh just all of us in this room, we
[5:05] all come from a mother and a father. Uh
[5:08] I hope so. If you did not, I'd like to
[5:09] see you after service. But I think we've
[5:11] all come from a mother and a father.
[5:12] whether or not you knew them and whether
[5:15] or not you had a good relationship with
[5:17] your mother or your father, whether you
[5:20] had a good upbringing by them or whether
[5:22] you had an amazing upbringing by them.
[5:25] We all have a mother and a father. And
[5:26] the amazing thing about this and about
[5:29] what is being discussed here by the
[5:31] apostle Paul is that I I uh as a as a as
[5:36] a son to my mother and my father. There
[5:40] is absolutely nothing that can be done
[5:43] to change that. I am my father's son. I
[5:47] am my my mother's son and I always will
[5:51] be. Try as they might have to have
[5:53] changed that. They it it won't change. I
[5:55] I am I am my parents son. I'm I'm I'm a
[5:59] member of the family. I just am. But
[6:02] what I have been drawn to with this
[6:05] passage is the implication that the
[6:09] child should not always remain in its
[6:12] infancy, but that it should become an
[6:14] adult, a functioning adult. So although
[6:18] I remain my father and my mother's son,
[6:21] which I always will be, and there's
[6:23] nothing that could change that, there's
[6:25] nothing that would change the the
[6:26] physicality of it or the nature of that.
[6:29] It just is.
[6:31] Even though that be the case, the
[6:33] scriptural implication is that I move
[6:35] from a child to a functioning adult
[6:40] with accountability, with
[6:41] responsibility,
[6:43] able to function as the Lord sees fit.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nowhere in the scripture do you
[6:48] see the uh there is there an admonition
[6:52] to remain childish
[6:55] &gt;&gt; to to be immature.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; The the challenge the the implication is
[7:01] that you would grow up
[7:03] &gt;&gt; is that you would no longer remain a a
[7:06] child but you would be an adult while
[7:08] knowing you are a child.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; You you are a son. You are a daughter to
[7:13] your parents. That just is true. But the
[7:16] idea is that you would no longer be
[7:18] childish, but you would be grown up.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thing. Now,
[7:25] the other uh thing that I I'm always
[7:28] drawn to and and just thinking about
[7:30] this, especially towards the beginning
[7:32] of this passage, now I say that the
[7:34] heir, as long as he is a child, he
[7:36] deferth nothing from a servant, though
[7:40] he be the Lord of all. Now, I will tell
[7:43] you, uh, and I don't know about you, but
[7:45] I, like I said, I'll be myself and I'll
[7:47] just be personal and I'll be a little
[7:49] bit vulnerable with you tonight if
[7:50] that's okay. Uh, I
[7:54] sometimes in my life,
[7:57] we look at this passage of scripture and
[7:59] we think I I I see that, brother Steve.
[8:02] I I understand that yes, the scriptural
[8:04] implication is to become a mature
[8:06] functioning adult and not remain a child
[8:09] even though we are still the children of
[8:10] God.
[8:11] and he is our father. But what Paul is
[8:14] teaching is that we are no longer a
[8:16] servant but a son with inheritance.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you uh I in in in just my
[8:25] life
[8:26] um
[8:28] Peter refers to the hidden man of the
[8:32] heart, the hidden the hidden person of
[8:34] the heart. And every single one of us in
[8:37] this room,
[8:39] young, middle-aged, old, how, wherever
[8:42] you sit, wherever you lie, there's every
[8:44] single one of us in this room that is uh
[8:48] that person, that hidden person of the
[8:50] heart. Now, the Hebrews, they didn't
[8:52] have a term for the brain. Uh they just
[8:55] they didn't have a they didn't refer to
[8:56] the brain. They they referred to the
[8:58] heart as a man thinkketh in his heart.
[9:01] They refer to that person that is you.
[9:04] That that hidden person that no one else
[9:06] sees. The person that is really who you
[9:09] are.
[9:11] And that's who Peter was referring to.
[9:14] The hidden man of the heart. That that
[9:17] place that is very intimate.
[9:20] And that is a that is a place that is
[9:22] the person that all of all of you are.
[9:25] All of you have that that hidden person
[9:27] of the heart. And that person may or may
[9:31] not be spiritually healthy.
[9:33] You may be okay. You may not be okay.
[9:37] And the amazing thing about it is that
[9:39] pe the people around you may never know.
[9:41] They may never see that.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; They may pick up a few things and say so
[9:44] and so is acting a little bit different
[9:46] or you know I hope they're okay or maybe
[9:48] they seem like they're going through
[9:49] something. But really what's going down
[9:50] on the on the on the deep of the deep of
[9:52] the deep inside of you that hidden
[9:55] person of the heart that is the that is
[9:58] the person that the Lord wants
[10:01] &gt;&gt; as I walk in in in the light of the day
[10:04] and the message of the hour as a as a
[10:06] Holy Ghost fililled believer that's who
[10:08] the Lord wants is that hidden person of
[10:11] the heart the real you.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; And that person has to deal with a lot
[10:16] of different things. Um, we know the
[10:19] avenues of of the spiritual realm that
[10:21] that Satan utilizes, memory, conscience,
[10:24] reason, all those different things.
[10:25] Satan has has access to that uh that
[10:28] person that is you. As a man thinkketh
[10:30] in his heart, brother Brandon was very
[10:32] clear that that's where the battleground
[10:34] rages is that that person and that
[10:36] person
[10:39] has to deal with a lot
[10:41] because memories aren't erased. Memories
[10:44] are a very physical thing. It is a it is
[10:46] a physical thing that happens in your
[10:48] brain that God himself fashioned and
[10:51] gave to you and the experiences that you
[10:54] have throughout your life. All the
[10:55] different things that every single one
[10:57] of you have done, the the vast
[10:59] difference of our lives here in this
[11:01] room. If we could all tell our stories,
[11:02] the places that we've been, the people
[11:04] that we've seen, our upbringing, who our
[11:06] father and mother were, how they raised
[11:09] us, all of that impacts the hidden
[11:11] person of the heart. And that person is
[11:14] who the Lord wants to get get attention.
[11:18] He wants intimacy with that person. He
[11:21] wants fellowship with that deep down
[11:23] person.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; But that deep down person is affected by
[11:28] so many different things.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; I was talking to um a young lady
[11:34] recently and um she was taken advantage
[11:37] of when she was a young girl um not once
[11:41] but three times.
[11:43] And uh she um she never told anybody
[11:49] and she she never felt comfortable
[11:51] telling anybody
[11:53] um because when she tried to bring it up
[11:58] um
[12:00] they dismissed it. And so there was
[12:02] never anybody that she she was not in a
[12:04] strong church. She was not in a healthy
[12:06] church by any means obviously. uh and
[12:10] she never felt comfortable opening up
[12:12] and and saying anything to anybody. So,
[12:14] she never did.
[12:16] And she lived uh all of her young life,
[12:19] she lived all of her young life carrying
[12:21] that in the hidden person of the heart,
[12:25] never being able to adequately deal with
[12:27] that, properly address it. And so she
[12:30] shoved that down
[12:32] and tried to to cope with the feelings
[12:38] of shame and regret and all the things
[12:41] that would accompany that. She felt at
[12:44] fault. She felt uh used. She felt dirty.
[12:49] And so her um when when you when you see
[12:55] uh scriptures that your father loves you
[12:59] and that you are valuable and that you
[13:01] are precious in the sight of the Lord,
[13:04] she she had to deal with that that
[13:06] feeling way deep down that nobody knew
[13:11] that she was dirty. And that may be true
[13:14] for somebody else, but that was
[13:16] certainly not true for her.
[13:19] And it was so intimate that nobody
[13:21] nobody knew. Nobody talked about that.
[13:22] But that's how she she came to church.
[13:24] She sat down. She did all the things.
[13:27] She she walked uh as as best a Christian
[13:31] life as she could,
[13:33] but there was still that that deep down
[13:36] feeling of shame and that that an
[13:40] awareness or um feeling that very few of
[13:44] us could ever truly empathize with that
[13:47] she was not really a daughter of God.
[13:51] even though she believed and she walked
[13:54] and she came to church and she had all
[13:56] all of that was happening deep down.
[13:59] I've talked to uh and you you can go
[14:01] through each one of your own stories and
[14:03] each one of your own lives and you deal
[14:05] with different things. You have so much
[14:06] that you carry with you. Failures, your
[14:09] own inequalities, your own concerns,
[14:11] your complexities, the the complexity
[14:14] that is you.
[14:16] And that person that you got ready, you
[14:18] fed, you you you dragged them to church
[14:21] tonight. You're sitting here and you're
[14:22] tired and you've got uh difficulties at
[14:24] work, difficulties in career, you've got
[14:26] questions, you've got um things that
[14:28] you're trying to figure out, sort
[14:30] through, not just for yourself, but
[14:32] perhaps for your family or for a friend
[14:33] or for whatever. and then you've got
[14:35] work things and then you've got all
[14:36] these and you're just you're just trying
[14:38] to to um exist
[14:41] somewhat healthfully. That's the person
[14:44] that the Lord wants to deal with
[14:46] intimately. That's that's the real you.
[14:49] The deep deep down, not the not the part
[14:52] that I see, although it's beautiful and
[14:54] it's pretty. It's the real deep down.
[14:57] That's who the Lord wants to know and to
[15:00] affect. And that's who Paul is talking
[15:03] about here in Galatians.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; I want you to um uh uh Paul is saying, I
[15:10] want you to understand that a a a
[15:13] servant, it defers nothing even though
[15:15] he is a child. He's thinking like a
[15:18] servant. And I want you to start
[15:20] thinking like a child of God.
[15:24] And I I um that even if you go to to
[15:29] Psalms 139 and I was reading that just
[15:31] the other day and we were talking about
[15:33] that uh in our church, you are fearfully
[15:35] and wonderfully made. And he says, "Thou
[15:37] hast searched me. Thou hast known me.
[15:40] Thou understandest my thought a far
[15:42] off." The Lord is is concerned with that
[15:46] hidden person of the heart. He is
[15:48] concerned with you.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Personalize it now. Don't say, "Well,
[15:53] he's concerned with somebody else
[15:55] because they are more spiritual or they
[15:57] are something else." He is concerned
[15:59] with you as an individual.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Every single one of you in this room,
[16:05] &gt;&gt; the Lord is concerned about you. There
[16:07] was a uh the I I always go back to um
[16:10] this thought in in Revelations chapter 4
[16:13] and what the message of the hour is. And
[16:16] to me, the the the message of the hour
[16:18] and walking in the truth and in the
[16:20] light of this day is a voice out of
[16:22] heaven that called to me.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; It was personal.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; He called to me and he said, "Come out
[16:29] of h of her, my people, and and walk in
[16:32] newness of life." It is Christ in you,
[16:35] the hope of glory.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Not in somebody else, in me.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; And in you,
[16:40] &gt;&gt; personalize it. And in that hidden man
[16:43] of the heart, that's who the Lord wants
[16:45] to speak to and to deal with intimately
[16:48] and personally and and cultivate and
[16:51] bring to a place of health.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Not just existence or striving, but of
[16:58] health.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; As cheesy as it may sound, the Lord
[17:03] really does want you to be spiritually
[17:07] healthy. Amen.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Not just existing, not just striving and
[17:12] and just going from one service to the
[17:14] next or feeling like you're you're not
[17:16] where you should be. Um uh uh and and
[17:19] striving for acceptance. If I could only
[17:21] maybe some of you, you have this idea of
[17:24] this spiritual titan that's out there
[17:27] somewhere that is you. Um at some point
[17:30] in time that you will eventually be. And
[17:33] when you're that person, then everything
[17:35] will be fine. everything will be um uh
[17:38] spiritually uh peaches and cream when I
[17:40] can become that that person that I I
[17:43] know I should be. But right now there's
[17:46] I'm not worthy. I I'm I'm not deserving
[17:48] of that. I'm not I'm I'm um and and you
[17:51] you exist in that place of just
[17:55] continually putting yourself down
[17:58] when that's not how the Lord speaks
[17:59] about you.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; The Lord says you are fearfully and
[18:03] wonderfully made.
[18:05] And that was true before you were
[18:07] formed,
[18:08] &gt;&gt; before your earthly bodies were here.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; The fact that the Lord David wrote that
[18:13] a long time ago that you are fearfully
[18:15] and wonderfully made and you know that
[18:17] if there's a deep that calls to the deep
[18:19] in in you, if you feel compelled to the
[18:21] Lord, that is not the devil.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; So if you are here tonight and you feel
[18:25] compelled to to um respond to the Lord,
[18:30] that is the Lord. There is a deep there
[18:33] because you're responding to the Lord.
[18:34] The devil would not put that in you or
[18:36] lead you to do that. That is the Lord
[18:38] that you would want to respond to the
[18:40] presence of the Lord and want to know
[18:42] the Lord more intimately. Deep down.
[18:44] That is the Lord who did that. And if
[18:46] that's the case, then you were in his
[18:48] mind before the foundation of the world.
[18:50] There's something there. You were you
[18:52] were his before you were you were formed
[18:55] in this fleshly body. So you are
[18:58] fearfully and wonderfully made before
[19:00] you were even formed. So therefore I had
[19:03] in mind for you in the future.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that you can you as
[19:10] old as whoever it may be? I want you to
[19:13] I want you to really uh understand. Do
[19:17] you understand that the scripture says
[19:18] that yet while we were in sin God came
[19:21] to you.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; It was while we were in sin that God
[19:26] came to you. and the mistakes that
[19:27] you've made and all the things that
[19:29] you've done uh uh do not diminish the
[19:32] fact that he said about you, he
[19:36] fearfully and wonderfully made you.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; You are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[19:42] But because of
[19:45] perhaps that unhealth that exists in the
[19:49] hidden man,
[19:51] we can exist spiritually
[19:55] like a servant and we can walk with a
[19:59] servant's mindset
[20:01] instead of living with the life of a son
[20:04] and daughter of God.
[20:06] So, as a result of of all the things
[20:09] that the enemy can do towards you or all
[20:12] the things that that maybe have happened
[20:14] in your life to to cause you to think,
[20:16] well, that's not me. I I'm not um I'm
[20:19] not worthy of of of Jesus Christ or the
[20:22] gospel or whatever it may be deep deep
[20:24] down now. And you think, well, I'm I'm
[20:26] I'm never going to be that spiritual
[20:28] titan that I want to be. I want you to
[20:31] understand that many of us and I'm
[20:33] speaking from personal experience. I
[20:35] just call it a testimony if you will
[20:37] that you're you're walking with a
[20:40] servant's rel. If I if I do this then
[20:43] the Lord will be pleased with very big
[20:45] difference because a servant in a home
[20:47] is very different than than a a child
[20:50] living in that home heir to all things.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; A servant lives in the household to
[20:56] please the master. A servant lives in
[20:58] the household to please the master and
[21:00] on the basis of what they and on the
[21:02] basis of what they do. A child exists in
[21:06] the home because of who they do. A child
[21:08] exists in the home because of who they
[21:11] have me whether they like it or not.
[21:12] They have me of the life that I have now
[21:15] is that I so longingly want to be then
[21:19] everything will be fine. And you're
[21:21] living essentially you're leaning toward
[21:23] a legalistic mindset. Brother Vanom, he
[21:26] he and I said, Brother Vanom, he he and
[21:29] I I I don't have the exact phrase here
[21:31] tonight, but he said uh I don't have the
[21:33] exact phrase here tonight, but he said
[21:34] uh essentially something um essentially
[21:37] something um uh talking about legalism.
[21:41] And he said uh talking about legalism
[21:44] and he said a legalist will make you uh
[21:47] a legalist will make you uh can be done.
[21:50] That person didn't do this be done. That
[21:54] person didn't do this. that person a
[21:56] servant lives with a legalistic and a
[21:58] servant's mindset is a very unhealthy
[22:01] place to stay
[22:04] &gt;&gt; because all of us might be in that place
[22:07] but you don't have to stay like that
[22:10] &gt;&gt; because you're a son and daughter of
[22:11] God.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; So you can very quickly move from a
[22:16] servant's mindset to living the life of
[22:19] a son and daughter of God.
[22:21] A servant is um exists on the basis of
[22:27] what they can do. They strive
[22:30] and I'll be and I'll be honest with you
[22:33] that is exhausting honest with you that
[22:38] is exhausting.
[22:40] Now there's a different legalistic
[22:42] mindset which is a dangerous place to be
[22:45] because what what will very quickly um
[22:49] uh root in that kind of an attitude is a
[22:51] religious spirit and a religious spirit
[22:54] is the hardest thing to uproot and to
[22:56] get out of an assembly. you if I it
[23:00] should be called out and dealt with so
[23:02] quickly a religious spirit and it can
[23:04] happen so fast if there is a legalistic
[23:07] mindset um that that that is is is
[23:10] staying in you.
[23:13] It starts with you
[23:15] &gt;&gt; to say, "Well, that person isn't doing
[23:17] that and that person isn't doing that,
[23:19] but I'm doing this."
[23:22] And that's a that's a very unhealthy
[23:23] place to be.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; And you that that happens inside of you,
[23:29] a servants's religion. Now,
[23:33] that that thing and I I I believe this
[23:36] kind of servants religion to me is
[23:40] precisely what Paul told Timothy. They
[23:42] have a form of godliness and deny the
[23:44] power thereof because the scripture says
[23:47] that they would endure doctrine uh but
[23:49] not sound doctrine.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; And that's in a message church too. I
[23:53] don't believe he's just talking about
[23:55] denominational people and message people
[23:57] here. I believe he's talking about to an
[23:59] individual a person who can be even in a
[24:01] message church and think very um in a
[24:04] very denominational way. They can have
[24:07] uh uh they can um tolerate doctrine but
[24:10] not sound doctrine.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; They can tolerate it until it it it uh
[24:14] kicks against the pricks as Paul would
[24:16] say until it until it hits that very
[24:18] deep intimate place that you are
[24:21] guarding
[24:22] and it hits that place that you don't
[24:24] want to really open up. You don't want
[24:25] to deal with because you're trying to
[24:27] cope and you've you've coped with it for
[24:29] so long. If you kind of open it up,
[24:31] whatever it may be, uh an attitude, an
[24:34] issue,
[24:36] um a personal issue or or something that
[24:39] has happened to you a long time ago and
[24:41] you're trying to keep that down and you
[24:42] don't want to deal with it. It's a very
[24:44] uh it's it's a very exhausting thing to
[24:46] do to strive as a servant with a
[24:49] servant's mindset, with a servant's
[24:52] religion. It's utterly exhausting. And
[24:55] you try and you try and you say, "Well,
[24:56] if I could just if I could just overcome
[24:58] this." And so you try to overcome that
[25:00] and and you you understand that there's
[25:03] there's an effort that Paul says you've
[25:06] got to put into your spiritual walk. But
[25:09] the difference is putting your effort in
[25:12] with just your flesh without the spirit.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; How you move from a a son's or a a
[25:20] servant's religion to a son's life is
[25:23] you embrace Christ that is in you. Amen.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; It is, as brother Benham said, a
[25:29] bubbling well from the inside out. And
[25:31] you've got to run to that instead of
[25:34] embracing your sheer determination and
[25:36] your sheer will. When the Apostle Paul
[25:39] said, I it's not that I I um beat the
[25:43] air as nothing. He says, I get under my
[25:45] body. Whether it be something that you
[25:47] are trying to overcome, whether it be an
[25:49] attitude, a thought, something like
[25:51] that, you bring it into subjection and
[25:53] the obedience of Christ. You grab a hold
[25:56] of that thing and you you actually bring
[25:58] it subject to the obedience of Christ.
[26:01] Anything that would set itself against
[26:03] the knowledge of Christ. You grab a hold
[26:05] of that thing and bring it into the
[26:07] obedience of Christ.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; That's how you walk. That's how you
[26:12] live. Think on those things which are
[26:14] true and are pure. You actively do that.
[26:17] You you you die daily to bring yourself
[26:21] to that that action to that thinking.
[26:24] That is effort. That is what what Paul
[26:26] says to do. Not as one beating the air,
[26:28] but I get under my body so that I can
[26:31] bring it into subjection to the spirit
[26:33] that is within me.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; It is no longer I who live, yet though I
[26:38] live in the flesh, it is now Christ who
[26:40] lives in me. Paul in Galatians chapter 4
[26:43] is speaking to Holy Ghostfilled people.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm addressing you who have been
[26:51] born again.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the hidden man, the
[26:55] memories that you carry, all of those
[26:57] things don't get deleted when you have
[27:00] the new birth.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; You carry those with you.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; There I think um brother Donnie Reagan
[27:08] preached a sermon years ago called
[27:10] scars. I believe it was called scars. I
[27:13] don't know what the title was, but he
[27:14] was saying those scars don't get deleted
[27:18] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[27:20] Spirit. I'm speaking to Holy
[27:22] Ghost-filled people this evening. All of
[27:24] you who have received a new birth, a
[27:26] supernatural change in your life.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; And now you are sitting in newness of
[27:32] life. There should be then no more
[27:35] condemnation.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; You should be free. You should have the
[27:39] mindset and walk in the life of as a as
[27:42] a son and daughter of God. In the very
[27:45] next few verses here in Galatians
[27:46] chapter 4, he says, "So then why?" He
[27:49] says, "How be it then, when you know not
[27:51] uh when ye knew not God, ye did service
[27:53] unto them. But now after the ye have
[27:55] known God, or rather are known of God."
[28:00] Very important passage. I'm reading in
[28:02] chapter 4 and verse 9. He says, "Now
[28:04] that you know God, or rather have been
[28:07] known of God," and that's the difference
[28:10] between a message believer and someone
[28:11] who is not, is that God knows you. He
[28:16] knows who you are. There's so many that
[28:18] would be there in front of him. Matthew
[28:20] chapter 24 and Jesus and they would say,
[28:22] "Have not we cast out devils in your
[28:24] name." We knew you. Why? I I knew you. I
[28:27] I served you. I I did all that I could.
[28:29] I strived to be a person that would be
[28:32] pleasing to the person of Jesus Christ.
[28:35] And he said, "But I did not know you."
[28:38] The difference between a a a person who
[28:41] has received a new birth, a message
[28:43] believer and someone who is not is that
[28:47] he [snorts]
[28:48] filled you.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; You did not get the Holy Ghost. He got
[28:52] you.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; He knew you. So now that you know God
[28:55] and rather have been known of God, why
[28:59] go back then? And he says, why go back
[29:01] again to the weak and the beggarly
[29:03] elements where unto you desire again to
[29:05] be in bondage? In other words, if you
[29:07] are heir to to of of Christ in all
[29:09] things and you now have the life of
[29:12] Christ and you are no longer a servant,
[29:14] but you are a son and daughter of God,
[29:16] why on earth then would you want to go
[29:18] back
[29:18] &gt;&gt; and live by the the beggarly elements,
[29:21] the the things that offer no life, which
[29:24] would be the flesh?
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; So then why strive with the servants's
[29:28] religious mindset of if I do these
[29:31] things then I will be okay. If I achieve
[29:33] this idea of spiritual titan that I want
[29:36] to be then I will be someone who be will
[29:39] be accepted by God when he said I knew
[29:42] you before the foundation of the world.
[29:44] You are a child because I I I knew you
[29:48] and your birth is a manifestation of
[29:51] that that that fornowledge. Your birth
[29:54] you were predestinated unto the adoption
[29:57] of sons. And the spirit that now works
[30:00] in you is it's no longer I who live, yet
[30:02] do I live. It is Christ who lives in me.
[30:06] So when Paul says, "Now I don't beat the
[30:08] air as someone who uh uh is is doing
[30:10] nothing. I bring that into subjection to
[30:13] Christ." He's talking about the hidden
[30:15] man of the heart. He's talking about the
[30:18] real you deep deep deep down that nobody
[30:21] here really would see. Your spouse may
[30:23] not even really know who you are deep
[30:25] deep down. You try to communicate and
[30:28] you try um uh uh because nobody has
[30:31] communication problems in their
[30:32] marriage, but you try to communicate and
[30:35] you try to share who that person is. But
[30:37] there's still difficulty in even sharing
[30:39] to your spouse who you really are deep
[30:42] down. What thoughts play out uh the the
[30:45] doubts that you may have, the thoughts
[30:46] that you have, the really intimate parts
[30:49] that only the Lord really knows.
[30:53] That's that's where the Lord wants to
[30:55] have fellowship with you is in the deep
[30:58] parts of your heart
[31:01] as a Holy Ghost-filled believer to
[31:03] really know who you are. And I'll be
[31:05] honest with you, the servants's
[31:07] religion, it comes from a heart that is
[31:09] unhealthy. I believe it really comes
[31:12] from a place that you're you're trying
[31:13] to hide. um you're trying to keep uh uh
[31:16] you've got such a guard up for whatever
[31:18] reason
[31:20] and a real surrender to walk with the
[31:23] spirit is is to open up that place to
[31:27] the Lord is to really allow the Lord to
[31:31] be intimate with you and say, "Lord, I'm
[31:34] I'm I'm unhealthy right now." Just to be
[31:38] honest with yourself. And this takes
[31:40] boldness. Come boldly before the throne
[31:42] of grace.
[31:44] And this takes boldness to say, "Lord, I
[31:46] I I I'm I'm struggling.
[31:49] I'm I'm I'm playing the part in church,
[31:52] but I feel like I'm striving for
[31:54] something that I can't achieve."
[31:57] And it takes resting
[32:00] in who you really are.
[32:03] And who you really are is not a servant
[32:06] in in the in God's kingdom. You are a
[32:10] son and a daughter of God.
[32:15] That's what the scripture says of you.
[32:17] But if you're coming at your walk or
[32:20] you're living thinking like a servant,
[32:24] then you'll never be at rest because
[32:27] you'll always be striving.
[32:30] If I could just do that or I shouldn't
[32:31] have done that. I got to I got to do
[32:33] this by my sheer will. Do you understand
[32:35] that by your sheer will you cannot give
[32:38] yourself eternal life?
[32:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is life. He is the
[32:43] truth, the life, and the way.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; And when Christ is in you, now you have
[32:47] the life, Christ in you, the hope of
[32:50] glory. And it is by that life now that
[32:53] you live. It is by the power of the life
[32:56] of Christ that is now on the inside of
[32:58] you that you can actually bring things
[33:00] subject to the obedience of Christ. That
[33:02] you can actually reach out and grab a a
[33:05] thought and bring it into the obedience
[33:07] of Christ.
[33:10] But the choice to do so is yours.
[33:12] Because the Lord does not take free
[33:14] moral agency away from every single
[33:16] person in this room now. The Lord does
[33:18] not take free moral agency away from you
[33:20] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[33:22] Spirit. You still have it sitting in
[33:24] your seat tonight. You have the ability
[33:26] to choose to grab a thought and bring it
[33:29] subject to the obedience of Christ
[33:32] or to dwell on it
[33:34] &gt;&gt; and let it turn over and turn over and
[33:37] turn over. And you know what that is? Is
[33:39] maturity.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; The scriptural implication and all
[33:44] throughout the New Testament and all
[33:46] throughout the no old testament is that
[33:47] you don't remain a childish kid.
[33:52] You're a son. You're a daughter. That's
[33:55] by predestination. That is by election.
[33:58] You are a son and daughter of God with
[34:00] value. You are not a servant.
[34:03] You are a true son and daughter of God
[34:06] with value in the presence of God, able
[34:08] to come boldly before his throne.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; But you've got to be willing
[34:15] to surrender to him in a way
[34:19] &gt;&gt; where you are no longer thinking like
[34:22] the servant, but you're acting like a
[34:24] son
[34:25] &gt;&gt; to the point where milk can become meat.
[34:29] Amen.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; When I became a man, I put away childish
[34:33] things. Brother Bham, I've got so many
[34:35] quotes here. I'm just paraphrasing just
[34:36] for the sake of time here. So many
[34:38] different places, Brother Brandham would
[34:40] say, where we are in a season of
[34:42] ripening. Now, there's a difference
[34:44] between ripening and growth. And the
[34:47] bride is in a period of ripening. The
[34:49] sun the the seed will uh um lay out in
[34:53] the presence of the sun and ripen. fruit
[34:57] ripens and it is manifesting time. The
[34:59] fruit is on the vine. So here we all are
[35:02] in this room in the midst of le oysia as
[35:06] believers who the voice of God is
[35:08] directly called to which is the message
[35:10] of the hour. He's directly called to you
[35:12] and said come up hither. Revelations 4 1
[35:15] and 2. It's a voice out of heaven saying
[35:18] uh come up hither. It's it's Revelations
[35:20] 10 8-11.
[35:22] We focus so much on Revelations 10:7,
[35:25] but Revelations 10:8-11, that's me.
[35:28] That's who I am. That's what the Lord
[35:30] has done in me. And as a result of that
[35:33] truth and that reality, I am in this
[35:35] room. You are in this room and we are
[35:38] together walking in the light as he is
[35:40] in the light. As a response to that
[35:42] voice in the in the final age directly
[35:45] to you as an individual,
[35:48] &gt;&gt; you've received a new birth. Now you
[35:50] walk in newness of life.
[35:53] And you are we are all all
[35:56] carrying that hidden person of the heart
[35:58] along with us and we have to grow up
[36:04] in a stage of ripening. Now the stock
[36:06] all throughout the church ages grew but
[36:08] the fruit ripens and that's where
[36:10] maturity comes into play. All throughout
[36:12] the scripture you see the implication of
[36:15] of of maturity of growth. And I'll be
[36:18] honest with you,
[36:20] sometimes as believers, we need to grow
[36:23] up.
[36:26] Uh my parents would say to me
[36:27] frequently, uh you need you need to grow
[36:31] up because what you're doing right now
[36:33] is not good. It is not wholesome. You
[36:35] need to stop it and you need to do what
[36:38] I've instead told you to do. And
[36:40] sometimes uh that um that was met with
[36:43] fierce resistance by my tiny brain. and
[36:47] uh and and thus uh there's a lot of
[36:49] conflict there with me. Uh and I I
[36:52] needed someone in my face to say what
[36:54] you're doing is destructive.
[36:57] Stop it. This is the healthy thing to do
[37:01] and this is the right thing to do. So do
[37:04] it. Whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; So the hidden man of the heart, even
[37:09] though we've made mistakes, we're on the
[37:11] basis of free moral agency, he fills you
[37:13] with his spirit. Separation is implied
[37:16] by a member of the of of of the bride of
[37:19] Jesus Christ. Come out of her, my
[37:20] people. But we are not called to
[37:22] isolation. We are not Amish people.
[37:25] Right? We are we are called out of her,
[37:27] my people. We are filled with the spirit
[37:29] of the Lord and then turned right around
[37:31] and sent back into the world to be a
[37:34] witness and to be the an expression of
[37:37] who the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:40] is to those in our community. Amen.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; I always look and I was saying this to
[37:44] the church just a little bit ago. If we
[37:46] are just a group of people that come in
[37:48] and have a wonderful service every
[37:50] service and then that's it and we have
[37:52] no expression to the community around
[37:54] us, then of what value is the church?
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just get a a a um a a
[38:00] convent and just all exist in the
[38:02] building like the Amish? If you cannot
[38:05] express Christ to your very own
[38:07] community, then of what what value are
[38:10] you to it?
[38:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; The Lord filled you with the Holy Spirit
[38:14] and sent you right back out into the
[38:16] world to be a witness, to be a testimony
[38:19] &gt;&gt; just to express go the Christ to in your
[38:22] community. I believe all of our
[38:24] communities need to see you
[38:27] &gt;&gt; because for many that will be the only
[38:30] grace that they will ever experience.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; So let your light shine. Don't be
[38:34] ashamed of the gospel.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; You've got a wonderful church here. Let
[38:37] it shine. Your community needs you.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; But as a result, that that um maturing
[38:45] that milk to meet that is the
[38:48] implication.
[38:50] We are no longer uh um we have not I
[38:54] believe it's Romans chapter 8. We have
[38:56] not received the bondage again unto
[38:58] fear, but we have the received the
[39:00] spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba,
[39:02] Father." As a result of being Holy Ghost
[39:06] believers, the responsibility to the
[39:08] children of God is that you no longer be
[39:11] children tossed to and fro by every wind
[39:13] of doctrine,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; but that you be adults.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are able to
[39:20] understand this is the truth.
[39:22] Discernment is something that I believe
[39:24] is a gift of God.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; And he is he will give every person who
[39:29] asks of it wisdom liberally.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we have situations where
[39:34] we need wisdom. Anybody have that? I'm
[39:38] not speaking about just the church. I'm
[39:39] speaking about you as an individual,
[39:41] your family, your marriage, all of the
[39:44] situations that you face in your career
[39:46] and at work. You need wisdom. You need
[39:48] to grow up.
[39:51] in addition to the church because a
[39:53] church is a living organism. It grows,
[39:57] sometimes it contracts, sometimes it get
[39:59] it gets unhealthy, sometimes it's in a
[40:01] period of growth. A church is an amazing
[40:04] thing. Sometimes it gets sick, sometimes
[40:07] it gets it's really healthy. Sometimes
[40:09] it's strong. Sometimes it's it's it's uh
[40:12] has vitality. Sometimes it doesn't. And
[40:15] it takes maturity to be able to weather
[40:17] those things and to think on those
[40:20] things which are pure. To be able to
[40:22] discern that's unhealthy. When you when
[40:24] somebody's talking to you in the lobby
[40:26] and you start to gossip back and forth,
[40:28] the ability the actual ability to say,
[40:31] "I'm not going to do that."
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Because a spiritually immature, and I'm
[40:35] speaking on a very simple level here,
[40:37] but a spiritually immature person needs
[40:39] the validation to say, "You know what? I
[40:41] heard this as well.
[40:44] So and so said something and I I I you
[40:46] know I I um uh uh brother William here I
[40:50] I don't like his shirt.
[40:53] So did you see the shirt that Brother
[40:54] William had? and then I'm going to go
[40:57] and tell somebody and I you know it's
[40:59] it's a really funny example because I do
[41:02] like your shirt but that happens so
[41:04] frequently
[41:06] and uh on in in some issues that can
[41:09] cause a real problem in a church
[41:13] &gt;&gt; and it takes individuals
[41:15] in the presence of the Lord to be really
[41:17] honest with themselves to say I'm not
[41:20] going to spread that.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop that in its tracks.
[41:24] You know, the best way to stop gossip is
[41:26] to say nice about that. Say something
[41:28] nice about the person that someone is
[41:30] saying bad about. It's it's so awkward
[41:34] because they're saying, "Did you see
[41:35] brother William's shirt?" And you can
[41:37] say, "Yeah, at least he had a shirt on."
[41:40] And they're thinking, "I don't know
[41:42] where to go from here."
[41:45] And then spiritual immaturity thrives
[41:48] off of off of um letting your guard
[41:51] down. And I I I I I look at this
[41:54] scripture and what it challenges me to
[41:57] do as a as a message believer filled
[41:59] with the Holy Spirit living in the midst
[42:01] of Leodysia. And it gives it challenges
[42:03] me on such an intimate level
[42:07] to stop thinking like a servant and stop
[42:11] trying to get validation and and and and
[42:14] tr strive and just to rest as a son and
[42:18] daughter of God and knowing that he who
[42:21] began a good work in me will finish it.
[42:26] knowing that I I I I am no longer uh uh
[42:30] um in bondage again to fear
[42:34] &gt;&gt; of boy I I I if I you know if I'm not
[42:36] spiritual enough then the Lord won't be
[42:38] pleased with me or if I don't if I don't
[42:40] you know um if I because I did this and
[42:43] I got to do this and this and this and
[42:44] this to make up for it and to exist in
[42:47] that kind of a lifestyle is exhausting
[42:51] when with the power of the Holy Spirit
[42:54] We are not bondage to fear.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; And fear is a valless element, but it's
[43:00] very powerful. There's nothing to it.
[43:02] Fear is nothing. It's it's the it's the
[43:05] the question that something may or may
[43:07] not happen. That's what anxiety is. It
[43:09] may or may not happen. I am anxious uh
[43:12] that I'll trip over this um uh monitor.
[43:15] It hasn't happened yet, but if I'm if I
[43:17] allow myself to be so fearful that I may
[43:19] do it, then I'm just I'm going to I'm
[43:21] just going to live in fear my whole
[43:23] life.
[43:24] And then I'm going to I'm just I'm I'm
[43:26] going to navigate all around it because
[43:28] I'm nurturing that thing that may or may
[43:30] not have happened.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; It's I I I'm I'm I hope this is okay
[43:34] because I'm being just sharing my heart
[43:37] very simple and straightforward, but I
[43:39] am shocked at the amount of individuals
[43:42] who allow themselves to exist in fear
[43:45] and anxiety. Holy Ghost-filled people
[43:47] that are crippled by anxiety and and
[43:51] fear and the and the the striving wi
[43:54] living with a servants's religion and
[43:56] say, "Oh, if God will only be pleased
[43:58] with me if I do this or I do that or if
[44:01] so and so likes me or if so and so
[44:02] doesn't like me."
[44:04] and they're not able to be strong and
[44:07] sure
[44:09] and and and live with the strength of
[44:11] the Holy Spirit.
[44:13] And the understanding that I will make
[44:15] mistakes and I have made many, but by
[44:19] the mercy of Almighty God, he has made
[44:21] me clean.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; He has created a clean heart in me. He
[44:25] makes my paths straight.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; He leads me to to to still uh waters and
[44:31] and green pastures. He is his goodness
[44:34] is is um
[44:36] it's inexhaustive. I I I can't exhaust
[44:39] his mercy to to me.
[44:42] And to be able to walk strong and
[44:44] confidently in that knowledge of your
[44:48] identity in the person of the Lord Jesus
[44:50] Christ that he has made you no more a
[44:53] servant but a son and a daughter.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] walking as a Holy Ghost believer, being
[45:00] able with the maturity and the and the
[45:03] desire to move towards maturity and to
[45:06] go through the process and to to allow
[45:09] the Lord to chastise you because whom
[45:11] the Lord loveth, he does chastise. He
[45:14] brings maturity. It's the process of
[45:16] ripening. It's the process of changing.
[45:18] And that's very difficult. I was I was
[45:20] studying the other day. I was I was
[45:22] looking at just different things and um
[45:24] I was just uh uh unrelated but I was
[45:27] looking at progress and if you ever look
[45:30] at progress it's an amazing thing
[45:32] because we think as progress as starting
[45:34] from point A and moving to point B and
[45:37] and moving in this in this direction but
[45:39] if you look at actual actually what
[45:41] progress looks like it it goes up and it
[45:44] goes down and it goes up and it goes
[45:45] down and it goes up and it goes down. If
[45:47] you look at um uh uh uh I I don't know
[45:51] um Edison, you look at Edison in in the
[45:53] development of a light bulb, the amount
[45:55] of money that Edison was spending trying
[45:57] to create the light bulb and he was
[45:59] going it was going down and down and
[46:02] down and from an outward perspective,
[46:03] the pro the the um uh uh the uh you know
[46:07] the way that that project was being
[46:09] handled, the amount of money that was
[46:11] being spent, there was no real progress
[46:14] in our eyes. You understand? And it was
[46:18] going down and down and down. I think it
[46:19] was,00 times or near there that Edison
[46:22] failed to make the light bulb. And it
[46:24] would seem like everybody was saying,
[46:26] "Eddie, let's cash it in. Just cut the
[46:28] losses. Let's move out of here. We're
[46:30] making no progress." And in actuality,
[46:33] every single failure was progression
[46:36] towards the light bulb.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; And then one day, the light bulb came
[46:40] on.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Progress looks so different to us. And
[46:43] do you understand that the Lord is
[46:45] progressing you?
[46:48] &gt;&gt; You are changing. You are being molded.
[46:51] You are being shaped.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm not what I want to be.
[46:55] I'm not I'm not what I should be. But
[46:57] praise the Lord that I'm not what I used
[46:59] to be.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; He is slowly changing me. He who started
[47:03] a good work in me is finishing it.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is. You are here tonight by
[47:09] some means of of of mercy and grace. You
[47:13] you are here tonight. You you He hasn't
[47:15] let you go. You are here this evening.
[47:18] The Lord is working on you. You are
[47:21] being pro progressed. You are being
[47:23] matured. You are being worked on. The
[47:25] The Lord is fashioning the clay.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; He is finishing the work that he started
[47:33] in you.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[47:35] &gt;&gt; But at some point, you've got to move
[47:38] out of the mindset of of a servant and
[47:41] living a servant's religion
[47:44] and start walking like a son and
[47:46] daughter of God.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; And what that looks like
[47:51] is surrendering to the Holy Spirit and
[47:55] being vulnerable with him and saying,
[47:58] "Lord, I I'm I'm struggling.
[48:01] Lord, I I'm trying to overcome this
[48:03] thing and I can't. Lord, I want to be
[48:07] the kind of husband that I want to be. I
[48:08] want to be the kind of wife that I need
[48:10] to be. I want to be the kind of parent
[48:11] that I want to be. But I can't. I need
[48:15] guidance. I need help. I I need I need
[48:18] uh guidance. I need uh uh your help
[48:22] making a decision, whatever it may be,
[48:25] and walking securely, knowing that you
[48:28] are an heir of all things.
[48:32] Now, just in closing, and I I want to
[48:34] just stop with this,
[48:37] but
[48:39] living as a son and daughter of God, how
[48:42] many of you believe you're a son and
[48:43] daughter of God?
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Living like that and moving away from a
[48:48] a servants's religion. Now, the reason I
[48:51] use that term servant religion is not
[48:52] only because Paul uses it, but because I
[48:55] was raised in a message church. And for
[48:58] the vast majority of of my young life, I
[49:01] had this mindset. I can strive. I can do
[49:04] things. If I'm doing the sound in the
[49:06] church or I'm doing the video in the
[49:07] church, then I'm, hey, I'm, you know,
[49:08] I'm I'm participating and I'm just going
[49:10] to strive and I'm going to try to do it.
[49:11] It took it took the Lord really getting
[49:13] a hold of me to understand that I could
[49:17] rest in his acceptance
[49:19] based on what he already made me to be
[49:22] before the foundation of the world and
[49:24] not striving for it.
[49:27] He already made a way for me to be his
[49:29] son. He already the the lamb was slain
[49:33] before the foundation of the world. I
[49:35] receive that gift of the Holy Spirit. He
[49:39] made a way for it. I'm not striving for
[49:41] it.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; It's mine. Every promise in the book is
[49:45] mine. To be able to walk in assurance
[49:49] and not fear.
[49:51] To be able to walk securely and strongly
[49:54] even in the midst of trials. Now,
[49:56] understanding that moving from a
[49:57] servant's mindset to a to a son and
[49:59] daughter of God does not mean that
[50:01] you're you're the absence of difficulty
[50:03] and trials. It means you're able to
[50:05] withstand them as a son, as a daughter,
[50:08] strongly, assuredly.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; I know my redeemer liveth.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; This situation that is before me, I will
[50:15] deal with it head on and appropriately
[50:19] &gt;&gt; and effectively. Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Whether it be a struggle, whether it be
[50:22] something personal, whether it be your
[50:24] marriage, whether it be your children,
[50:25] whatever it may be, I'm going to I'm
[50:28] going to directly deal with this
[50:30] situation appropriately
[50:32] and seek the Lord for his help within
[50:35] it.
[50:37] Obeying the Lord out of love,
[50:40] not out of pressure.
[50:43] Pressure to perform. listening to the
[50:45] spirit, not the flesh, bringing those
[50:48] things subject to the obedience of
[50:49] Christ.
[50:51] Standing in authority
[50:54] and not not begging for permission
[50:57] &gt;&gt; to be able to stand like Joshua and
[50:59] speak directly to the son.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; It takes assurance. It takes a son's
[51:05] life and a daughter's life to be able to
[51:07] have the assurance to speak directly to
[51:08] the son to stand still.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. and not beg for permission,
[51:14] but to stand in the assurance of the
[51:16] word and in the authority of the word of
[51:18] almighty God
[51:20] that is in you.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Growing into maturity by receiving
[51:26] correction,
[51:28] being able to receive correction. The
[51:31] biggest um uh roadblock to maturing
[51:35] effectively is your inability to receive
[51:38] correction
[51:40] &gt;&gt; to the point where the minister will say
[51:41] something. God will send minister after
[51:43] minister after minister and you'll just
[51:44] say, "Don't want to hear that. I don't
[51:46] like that. So, I'm just going to I'm
[51:48] going to spit that cherry seed out even
[51:51] though it's not a cherry seed." Right?
[51:53] We take the cherry seed, we spit it out.
[51:55] That's referring to wrong doctrine not
[51:58] in accordance with the word. That is not
[52:00] res that is not a cherry seed is not the
[52:04] Lord trying to get your attention
[52:06] because you are doing wrong.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; So don't spit that out and say, "Well,
[52:09] that's a cherry seed." You need to
[52:12] swallow it
[52:13] &gt;&gt; like an adult
[52:15] &gt;&gt; and and take that as correction.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Be able to receive correction. That's
[52:20] walking as a son and daughter. Because
[52:22] whom the Lord loveth, he chastneth. and
[52:24] your the your the main uh uh uh
[52:26] contributor to your maturing process and
[52:29] your ability to be strong and to be sure
[52:33] in your walk with the Lord is to be able
[52:35] to receive correction from him.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Living in peace and not condemnation.
[52:45] I was looking the other day um uh at
[52:48] Joshua at Joshua chapter 5 and uh all
[52:52] throughout chapter Joshua chapter 5.
[52:54] It's a really interesting transition
[52:56] because all the time that they were in
[52:58] the wilderness and things like that,
[52:59] they had they they ate of the mana of
[53:01] the land and they were in the
[53:04] wilderness. They had not possessed the
[53:06] land. But then when Joshua comes into
[53:08] the land, things changed. And what
[53:11] happened was in Joshua chapter 5, and
[53:13] you don't have to turn there, but I'll
[53:14] just read it just briefly here because
[53:15] I'm coming to a close. He says, "And
[53:18] they did eat of the old corn of the land
[53:21] on the marorrow after the Passover,
[53:24] unleavened cakes and parched corn in the
[53:26] selfsame day. And the mana ceased on the
[53:29] marorrow after they had eaten of the old
[53:31] corn of the land. Neither had the
[53:33] children of Israel mana anymore, but
[53:35] they did eat of the fruit of the land of
[53:37] Canaan that year." You know what is an
[53:39] amazing thing? And I just I stumbled
[53:40] upon that u um a while back and I just
[53:44] focused on that and I was thinking they
[53:46] went from mana to corn. We see so much
[53:48] about the mana and the goodness that God
[53:50] had given them the mana. It was a very
[53:52] supernatural thing. Now they began to
[53:54] grumble and complain about it and the
[53:55] Lord dealt with them very uh uh swiftly
[53:58] about their grumbling against what God
[54:00] had given them in their time of need.
[54:02] But when they were in the wilderness,
[54:04] they were living off the mana which was
[54:06] a daily sustenance. It went bad really
[54:09] fast. It was daily. It was daytoday
[54:12] today today. They had mana. They went
[54:14] and got it. If they didn't collect it,
[54:16] it would rot except for the um uh the
[54:18] the hidden mana that was behind. It was
[54:21] around the ark. It it it stayed fresh.
[54:23] All the rest of the stuff that the
[54:24] people were living, it went dead. It
[54:26] went bad every single day. They were
[54:28] living day to day and and and literally
[54:31] going out and striving for that. But
[54:34] when they came into the land,
[54:36] understanding
[54:38] Ephesians, Joshua, the possession of the
[54:41] land is you receiving the baptism of the
[54:43] Holy Spirit and walking as a Holy Ghost
[54:45] fil believer. That is living in the
[54:48] land.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Right? Once they left from the
[54:51] wilderness and possessed the land, the
[54:54] mana stopped.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, they started to eat from
[54:57] the corn. And you know what was the
[54:59] amazing thing about the corn is that it
[55:01] it it it it
[55:03] exemplifies permanent residence.
[55:07] There was no turning back.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; They were eating uh uh it was permanent
[55:12] possession. They went from asking every
[55:14] morning and and uh what they needed to
[55:18] owning the land that God had given them.
[55:20] They were planting.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Now remember, brother Vandom was asked
[55:23] the question, "Will the bride have a
[55:24] ministry um you know and things like
[55:26] that?" And he said, "Well, sure. Go and
[55:28] plant the potatoes.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Live like he's coming tomorrow, but go
[55:32] and plant the potatoes. In other words,
[55:33] the idea of your life focusing intently
[55:37] on your maturity and your growth is
[55:39] submitting to the life of Christ that is
[55:43] on the inside of you is literally giving
[55:46] yourself to the power of the Lord Jesus
[55:48] Christ that is in our midst. Let him do
[55:51] the maturing. Listen um uh listen to
[55:54] what he is trying to do. receive the
[55:55] correction that he is trying to give
[55:57] you. Uh be intently focused on that
[56:00] transition.
[56:01] When I became a man, I put away childish
[56:04] things and letting your mind be run to
[56:06] and fro by every wind of doctrine, but
[56:08] being sure and being strong. When they
[56:11] moved, when Joshua moved from the
[56:13] wilderness to the land,
[56:16] they were per there was permanence.
[56:19] There was maturing. I'm going to plant
[56:21] the corn. We don't need the mana is not
[56:23] not we don't need that dayto-day um uh
[56:27] striving anymore. We're here to stay. We
[56:30] are going to work the land that God gave
[56:32] us.
[56:34] Now you go back to what Peter referred
[56:36] to as the hidden man of the heart. That
[56:39] person that is really that that that
[56:41] person that is you nobody in this room
[56:44] really knows about.
[56:48] you can bring that that person before
[56:50] the Lord because that's who he's
[56:53] interested in.
[56:56] He wants the real you deep down. That
[56:59] person that you're you're probably
[57:00] perhaps really, I don't know, scared of.
[57:03] You're scared of of letting that go.
[57:05] Maybe you've got control issues and
[57:07] you're afraid of letting go and saying,
[57:08] "Lord, I I want you to search the inward
[57:11] parts." As David would say in um uh uh
[57:15] in in Psalms 139, possess my reigns.
[57:20] That means your temperament, the inner
[57:22] emotion, the deep parts of you.
[57:25] Let the Lord there.
[57:28] Because when you get to that level of
[57:30] insincerity and that depth of really
[57:33] coming before the Lord, that's where
[57:35] maturity begins to really take place.
[57:39] Because now you're no longer afraid or
[57:41] in bondage of fear, keeping that down or
[57:43] just tiptoeing your religious life, just
[57:45] tiptoeing by all of these different
[57:48] things. Now you're able to say, "Lord,
[57:50] you know me.
[57:52] I am known of you. Search me, oh God."
[57:59] Would you bow your heads with me? I want
[58:01] to stop right there. Musicians, don't
[58:03] you come?
[58:12] And I
[58:14] I think so many times about this
[58:17] passage.
[58:19] Wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[58:21] a son. Wonder if we can say the song. I
[58:24] have a father.
[58:27] And just with our our heads bowed and
[58:29] our eyes closed, I I think about this
[58:31] passage.
[58:34] I I'm not a servant any I'm not a
[58:36] servant. I believe it's John chapter 15.
[58:39] He says I I call you no more servants. I
[58:41] call you friend.
[58:43] So if you're sitting there thinking not
[58:45] me, brother Steve, you don't know me.
[58:48] You don't know what's deep down.
[58:51] You don't know how much I've pushed
[58:53] back.
[58:54] I I want you to just just for a moment
[58:57] take a break from that and understand
[58:59] that the Lord speaks very differently of
[59:01] [music] you than what you're you're
[59:03] seeing yourself as because he doesn't
[59:06] see you as a servant. [music] He sees
[59:07] you as a friend.
[59:10] He doesn't see you as a hired help in
[59:12] [music] his kingdom as a hired hand. He
[59:15] doesn't see you as someone who's he's
[59:17] telling go get me a drink. [music] He
[59:19] doesn't look at you like that. He looks
[59:20] at you as a friend.
[59:22] He looks at you as a son and a daughter
[59:24] of God.
[59:27] Thereby his grace and his mercy.
[59:31] He found [music] value in you because
[59:33] you were in his mind before the
[59:34] foundation of the world.
[59:37] You are valuable. I don't know how you
[59:39] feel tonight. Maybe you think, well, you
[59:41] know, I don't care. Maybe you're
[59:44] struggling with apathy. Well, then let
[59:45] the Lord deal with that. [music] Bring
[59:47] that to the Lord. Come boldly before
[59:49] him. Say, ' Lord, I'm just I'm
[59:50] struggling to really have that vitality
[59:53] of life as a son and daughter of God.
[59:56] Then bring that to him. Whatever it is,
[59:59] wherever you are at, bring that to him
[1:00:02] and say, "Lord, here am I.
[1:00:06] Deal with me. I I'm I'm I'm being I'm
[1:00:10] going to open myself up. I'm going to be
[1:00:12] vulnerable with you. [music] Deal with
[1:00:14] me. Speak to me. And let the Lord have
[1:00:17] his way. Let the Lord have his wonderful
[1:00:21] way. Whatever it may be, wherever he may
[1:00:24] want to go, allow him to go.
[1:00:28] Maturity begins [music] right there.
[1:00:31] And you are able to be humble.
[1:00:35] And before we [music] pray, humble is
[1:00:38] not saying, "Oh, I'm I'm I'm a no. I'm a
[1:00:41] nobody. I'm a loser." No.
[1:00:44] I think true humility is is saying,
[1:00:47] "Lord, no, I am a child of [music] God.
[1:00:50] You you fashioned the clay that I am.
[1:00:55] You made me who I [music] am. You
[1:00:58] fearfully and wonderfully made me. So I
[1:01:00] humbly bow before you, knowing that in
[1:01:03] my flesh [music] I can't become who I
[1:01:05] need to be. It is only by your spirit
[1:01:08] that I live." That is humility.
[1:01:12] Come to the Lord as he made you uh to
[1:01:14] be. He who began a good work in you is
[1:01:18] finishing it. He is continuing it.
[1:01:22] Heavenly Father,
[1:01:25] Lord, on this wonderful Wednesday night,
[1:01:28] we're all in this room. We're all
[1:01:29] gathered together.
[1:01:33] Lord, you've made every single person in
[1:01:35] this room. That's not a Sunday school
[1:01:38] cliche.
[1:01:40] That is a a an amazing thing
[1:01:45] that you made us and you brought us all
[1:01:48] here. All different kinds of of people,
[1:01:52] all different kinds of backgrounds. And
[1:01:54] in each one of us, there is a hidden
[1:01:56] [music] person of the heart. And that's
[1:01:58] who you're after.
[1:02:02] And you said, "Forsake not the
[1:02:03] assembling of yourselves together." Here
[1:02:05] we are assembled together
[1:02:08] in your presence.
[1:02:10] And I pray Lord that you would have the
[1:02:12] freedom
[1:02:14] and the ability to move through our
[1:02:16] hearts and minds and bring them both
[1:02:19] subject to the word of God
[1:02:22] so that we could come face to face with
[1:02:24] who we really are in Christ. And from
[1:02:27] identity,
[1:02:29] I believe, comes maturity.
[1:02:32] When we really know who we are, you can
[1:02:35] begin to use us more effectively.
[1:02:38] I don't want to I don't want to be
[1:02:41] someone always striving. I don't want to
[1:02:44] be someone who who has a servant's
[1:02:45] religious attitude, always striving and
[1:02:48] never feeling like I can attain. Lord,
[1:02:51] you've already made a way. I am your
[1:02:54] son.
[1:02:56] Here sit your sons and your daughters.
[1:02:59] Lord, I pray that as as the bride of
[1:03:01] Jesus Christ, we could stand in strength
[1:03:04] and confidence and assurance
[1:03:08] that we are [music] the redeemed, not in
[1:03:10] arrogance, not in pride, but in humility
[1:03:14] with authority to claim the victory that
[1:03:18] is ours.
[1:03:20] I pray that you would give strength to
[1:03:22] the weak. I pray that you would lift up
[1:03:25] the downcast.
[1:03:27] Have your way in us, Lord. I pray
[1:03:32] have your way in us. I pray
[1:03:36] in the name of the [music] Lord Jesus
[1:03:37] Christ we ask. Amen.
