[0:00] I'm going to continue on the subject of
[0:02] hate and our title today is where's the
[0:06] confidence and in drawing using that
[0:09] phrase I am I'm thinking in terms of
[0:11] trust and faith and what we're resting
[0:14] in and I think there's maybe more ways
[0:16] that we could amplify that there's a lot
[0:18] in this subject if I feel at some point
[0:20] just to stop and not finish we can pick
[0:22] it up in a a later service but I'm going
[0:24] to take this question where's the
[0:26] confidence and so for a few moments I
[0:28] found myself kind of going back over
[0:30] Sunday service and I just kind of wanted
[0:31] to repr preach it um at least read all
[0:33] the scriptures again because it's
[0:35] amazing all the different scriptures in
[0:37] the Bible that deal with hate and the
[0:40] comparison of how that a dry morsel uh
[0:43] with quietness and tranquility and peace
[0:45] is better than you know all the sac
[0:46] houseful of sacrifices and hate therein
[0:49] so we see so much in the Bible that
[0:51] deals with uh the the strength that
[0:54] comes with peace and then how the losing
[0:56] of strength that comes from hatred and
[0:59] and so I just want to recap some things
[1:01] and maybe just draw some statements that
[1:02] we had made over the last few Services
[1:04] just to get us all on the same page to
[1:06] go forward but we've been using the
[1:08] definition of hate as an intense
[1:10] negative emotional response towards
[1:13] something or someone so it can be a
[1:15] situation it could be a thing or it
[1:16] could be someone and we've been using I
[1:19] think as a real good summary to
[1:21] understand really what hate represents
[1:23] it means to treat something or someone
[1:25] as your enemy and if you're treating
[1:27] someone as your enemy it can merely be
[1:29] because they have done something to make
[1:31] you think they want you harmed or
[1:33] destroyed or they want something of
[1:35] yours or if it's something there's a
[1:37] repulsion to it and you treat it as an
[1:39] enemy in other words you don't like it
[1:41] You' just be happy if it could be gone
[1:42] if it could be destroyed and so that
[1:44] phrasing of enemy is actually real
[1:47] strong in the scripture of hate and
[1:50] hatred so that's that's something I
[1:52] think that's real important to keep in
[1:53] our minds about the definition of hate
[1:56] is it means to treat as an enemy we've
[1:59] looked into how that we hate because
[2:01] we've left love and how that hate is an
[2:03] opposite to love and that in order to
[2:05] find hatred in our hearts we have to
[2:07] give room to hate um we have to give
[2:09] room to it and that happens when love
[2:11] doesn't have the preeminence and so we
[2:13] hate because we've left love or love
[2:14] isn't having preeminence and then once
[2:16] we start hating we lose our peace we
[2:19] just find ourselves sacrificing it we
[2:21] lay it down we lose it and so there's a
[2:23] losing of Peace whenever we hate a and
[2:26] those have been two themes that we've
[2:27] wanted you to recognize of what how hate
[2:30] enters in and then also what we begin to
[2:32] lose when we do hate because hate stir
[2:34] up contention stir up strife and and
[2:36] envy there's jealousy associated with it
[2:39] there's there's wrangling and hostility
[2:41] and where there's hostility and
[2:43] contention and competition it leads to
[2:45] loss it leads to Warfare it leads to
[2:47] even sacrifices that you make as a
[2:49] result of your hatred that are not
[2:51] beneficial so there's a lot that we
[2:53] could think about in terms of the
[2:54] consequences of hate but Sunday we are
[2:56] looking at how that hate steals our
[2:58] strength not not only is it going to
[3:00] take our peace but it's going to take
[3:01] our energy and maybe it's because it
[3:03] takes our peace that it takes our energy
[3:05] but we find ourselves uh uh losing
[3:08] strength because of hatred so hatred is
[3:10] a LIF draining emotion talked about how
[3:13] that it's a toxin to our bodies and our
[3:15] minds our our flesh and our minds our
[3:17] emotions and our physical health so
[3:19] we're using it in terms of hate is
[3:21] destructive hate is a cancer it's
[3:23] something that eats at you and it's atic
[3:25] poison brother B called it the poison
[3:27] acids and those are things that erode
[3:30] and corrode our mental health it
[3:32] corrodes and erodes our physical health
[3:34] so those are things we're wanting to
[3:35] think about in terms of the nature of
[3:38] hatred so we've looked at how it begins
[3:40] hatred and its origin and we've traced
[3:42] hatred of the world back to Satan
[3:45] evident in can and so if we have that
[3:47] emotion we know where it comes from so
[3:49] we've looked at its origin uh and we've
[3:51] looked at its nature and tonight we kind
[3:53] of kind of looking at how it starts and
[3:56] uh where I think we've looked at losing
[3:58] love and and those things as talking
[4:00] about how it starts but tonight I want
[4:02] to look a bit at how it starts and we'
[4:03] talked about how that we want to address
[4:05] how to overcome it I think those things
[4:07] are in here in each one of these
[4:08] Services already and we're using this
[4:10] statement where's the confidence where's
[4:14] the confidence and when you hopefully
[4:16] you could catch this tonight as we said
[4:18] well where's the peace and that's to
[4:20] that's to get you to think about wow
[4:21] maybe hate is the reason why I don't
[4:23] have peace or you say well where's the
[4:25] love you say oh maybe that's why Hate's
[4:27] found place in my heart because I've
[4:28] left love I want I'm wanting you to
[4:30] probe yourself with these questions and
[4:32] so by asking where is the confidence you
[4:35] should already start thinking well what
[4:36] does this have to do with faith uh with
[4:38] hate and you realize wow there is a
[4:39] great association between me hating
[4:41] someone or something and a losing of my
[4:44] confidence now I want to look at James
[4:47] chap
[4:49] 5:9 and in doing this we're continuing a
[4:51] little bit on where's the strength we're
[4:53] still going to kind of explore this uh
[4:57] how that hate drains us of life and
[4:59] power is going to be evident in the
[5:02] scriptures so in James 5:9 and I think
[5:05] it's very practical this evening in
[5:07] terms of the things we want to share and
[5:09] express and a lot of times you're
[5:11] studying a subject and you see a lot of
[5:13] deep things a lot of types and a lot of
[5:15] things kind of coming together and you
[5:16] want to preach something like that you
[5:18] really just want to get into it and
[5:19] preach and just everybody get a real uh
[5:22] Buzz from Revelation and uh but yet
[5:25] tonight I think in looking at the more I
[5:26] studied it the more I just felt I've got
[5:28] to really bring this out in a way that's
[5:29] just very practical and I think you're
[5:31] going to leave tonight very happy to
[5:33] have been here uh even though I've been
[5:35] told over and over again just how heavy
[5:37] the first three parts were and I I don't
[5:39] know if everybody's just kind of leaving
[5:42] like I've hated coming to these services
[5:45] I don't know if that's what's happening
[5:46] but I know it's heavy because it's real
[5:48] but I'm I'm hoping that there's
[5:50] encouragement in it to be able to
[5:51] uncover kind of these schemes of Satan
[5:54] in James 5:9 he says Grudge not one
[5:57] against another Brethren lest ye be
[5:59] condemned what a statement behold the
[6:02] judge standeth before the door now
[6:04] there's a lot more in this chapter in
[6:06] the chapters around some of it we're
[6:08] going to look into tonight but I had to
[6:10] kind of just narrow it down because it's
[6:12] so easy just to get caught up in a lot
[6:13] of these verses around it because they
[6:15] pertain to it but he just says Grudge
[6:17] not against uh another that Grudge in
[6:20] the Hebrew there excuse me in the Greek
[6:22] it means to find fault with and not just
[6:25] to find fault with them but in finding
[6:27] fault you wish to deprive them of
[6:29] something so if you Grudge them there's
[6:31] you want to take something away from
[6:32] them you're you're angry at them and
[6:35] these are all the emotions in a grudge
[6:36] there's anger there's fault finding and
[6:38] there's some sort of harm or deficit
[6:40] that you want them to experience and so
[6:43] it's ill will that you might have to
[6:45] someone and it's important to recognize
[6:47] that in the word it's suggested that
[6:49] this ill will is caused by
[6:52] something and so when we're dealing with
[6:54] hate it's not that we just wake up in
[6:55] the morning and we say um I I hate John
[6:59] Robinson I hate him and your wife's like
[7:03] who's John Robinson like I don't know
[7:05] but I hate him never met him I just know
[7:07] there's a John Robinson out there and I
[7:09] hate him never cross pathed never read
[7:11] his tweets uh but but I don't like him
[7:14] and that's but that's not what this
[7:16] Grudge is it's there's something that's
[7:17] been done there's some sort of
[7:19] Association that's an ill will caused by
[7:22] something if we were to look at the kind
[7:24] of modern-day definition of a grudge is
[7:26] to maintain feelings of anger and
[7:28] bitterness
[7:29] where you have resentment towards
[7:31] someone for what they've done that would
[7:33] someone say well I got a grudge against
[7:35] them they would immediately understand
[7:37] that something has been done to cause
[7:40] you to resent them or to have resentment
[7:43] or bitterness or anger towards
[7:46] someone now in studying this word in the
[7:49] Old Testament it kind of adds to what
[7:51] the meaning is to me in the scripture
[7:53] when it says Grudge not it means to keep
[7:55] in mind or memory an offense so when you
[7:59] gr Grudge someone you're like I'm going
[8:01] to remember that I'm not going to forget
[8:03] that I'm not going to let go of that and
[8:05] I I may forgive but I won't forget and
[8:07] actually my forgiveness is going to come
[8:09] back and haunt you because I'm going to
[8:10] use it against you but it's to keep in
[8:12] mind or in memory an offense it means to
[8:15] and the meaning to retain hatred if you
[8:17] Grudge something you're retaining enity
[8:20] against it you're going to say I I'm
[8:21] going to hold on to that and it's going
[8:24] to I'm going to use it at some point
[8:25] because I want there to be something to
[8:27] be deprived it means to return the deed
[8:31] so when you retain anger when you retain
[8:33] hatred and you Grudge from a scriptural
[8:35] standpoint you're holding on to this
[8:38] negative intense negative emotion with
[8:40] the intent that sometime at some point
[8:42] when you have the opportunity you're
[8:44] going to return in FA the kind you're
[8:46] going to return in kind and return the
[8:47] favor if they if there's been animosity
[8:49] there's been something done said or done
[8:51] or something taken away you're going to
[8:53] look for your chance to return the favor
[8:55] to them and I'd like to use this and I
[8:58] know it's self-serving to the subject
[9:00] matter but we because we can say it's a
[9:02] caution against resentment it's a
[9:03] caution against jealousy it's a caution
[9:05] against grudging I maybe be as I think
[9:07] about it maybe it's cautioning against
[9:09] being the Grinch right as we preached
[9:12] last year on don't be a grinch uh during
[9:14] this time but it's a caution against
[9:17] hate it's a caution to not be angry and
[9:19] wrathful and resentful and full of
[9:21] bitterness and we've looked at all those
[9:23] scriptures about bitterness and those
[9:24] things so these things kind of are
[9:26] combined together and it's identified in
[9:29] a lot of ways how it starts again it
[9:32] just doesn't say you know don't don't
[9:35] hate our Grudge and it a grudge can just
[9:38] you can wake up in the morning grudging
[9:39] against John Robinson whoever he might
[9:41] be and if he's streaming you know the
[9:42] Lord had this sermon for you uh I don't
[9:44] know what John Robinson that I know of
[9:46] but it's it's identifying where it
[9:48] starts because this Grudge it's because
[9:51] of something it will caused by something
[9:53] or to retain hatred for something that's
[9:55] been done to you there's often a good
[9:57] explanation for a grudge
[9:59] not a justification but an explanation
[10:02] and you'll find it right here in James
[10:04] 5:
[10:06] 1-6 let's walk let's read through this
[10:08] and recognize when James says Grudge not
[10:11] one against another lest you be
[10:13] condemned let's look at what he has to
[10:15] say go too now ye rich men weep and how
[10:18] for your miseries that shall come upon
[10:20] you so glad not to be rich he says your
[10:22] riches are corrupted and your garments
[10:24] are moth eaten your gold and silver is
[10:27] cankered and the rest of them shall be
[10:29] witness against you and shall eat your
[10:30] flesh as it were fire now there's a lot
[10:33] that James is saying here that we could
[10:35] expand upon and and amplify to
[10:38] understand just exactly what he means
[10:40] even in terms of analogy and and what it
[10:42] would mean to those who are rich and
[10:44] they're going to how because of their
[10:45] miseries and the rust of of their of
[10:48] their wealth he says you've heaped
[10:50] Treasures together for the last days and
[10:52] this is where kind of starts getting
[10:54] into what James is pointing at he says
[10:56] behold the higher of the labors who have
[10:58] reaped down your Fields so they're rich
[11:01] they're wealthy they've stored up and
[11:02] they've relied upon the labor of others
[11:05] uh to accumulate this wealth and to
[11:06] accumulate these possessions and James
[11:08] says something very uh uh important here
[11:11] which of you kept back which is of you
[11:13] kept back by fraud crith and so you've H
[11:17] withheld the wages that were due to them
[11:20] by fraud and by deceit you've taken
[11:22] advantage of the poor you've taken
[11:23] advantage of the labors you've taken
[11:25] advantage of those who don't have the
[11:27] same access to things as you and you've
[11:29] kept act by fraud and they cry out these
[11:31] labors that you've defrauded by deceit
[11:33] have cried out and the cries of them
[11:35] which have reaped are entered into the
[11:37] ears of the Lord of Sabbath you have
[11:39] lived in pleasure on the earth and been
[11:41] wanting you have nourished your hearts
[11:43] as in the day of
[11:44] Slaughter it it's kind of expressing
[11:46] this idea that these rich people are
[11:48] faring sumptuously off the backs of
[11:50] these laborers and they're taking
[11:52] advantage of them they're using them
[11:54] they're manipulating they're abusing
[11:55] them they're they're task Masters a a
[11:57] and since they have a a dis there's a
[11:59] disparity of power they're able to take
[12:01] advantage of them and they get them to
[12:03] work the whole season and they're
[12:04] promising them grain they're promising
[12:06] them wages they're promising them
[12:08] payment and insurance and all sorts of
[12:10] benefits and when it comes time to pay
[12:12] out they just pay a little bit a little
[12:14] bit more or just a little bit not as
[12:16] much as they were promised and he's
[12:17] saying they they're doing it by fraud
[12:20] and notice then kind of the real kickers
[12:22] he says you have condemned and killed
[12:24] the just and he does not resist
[12:27] you this is what uh is this is quite a
[12:31] picture that's being painted a and they
[12:34] have condemned the just and killed the
[12:36] just and even the just did not
[12:38] resist they haven't returned in kind
[12:41] they didn't go and burn the rest of the
[12:42] barley fields that hadn't been gleaned
[12:44] yet and they're not responding with this
[12:47] deceit and defraud themselves so it's
[12:49] quite a picture that James paints but
[12:51] this is how hate
[12:52] begins he describes a scenario where
[12:55] someone may be with uh more access to
[12:57] things and someone with the a a
[12:59] desparate uh situation in life has done
[13:01] something to hurt or to harm or to take
[13:03] advantage of you and he's saying this is
[13:05] through trauma hatred arises through
[13:08] offense hatred arises through
[13:10] fraud when someone lies to you that that
[13:13] causes a resentment when you have a bad
[13:16] experience that's why some people you
[13:18] know hate pineapple on pizza because
[13:20] they ate it one time and got sick and
[13:21] from then on you know they hate
[13:23] pineapple on Pizza others just hate it
[13:25] because some Italian tweeted out how you
[13:27] know Blasphemous it was
[13:29] and but that there's a bad experience
[13:31] with something and you hate it you
[13:33] detest it you despise it you're repulsed
[13:34] by it so I think it's important to
[13:36] recognize that James is kind of giving
[13:39] us some background here or this is what
[13:41] leads to his statement Grudge not
[13:43] against another brother lest you be
[13:44] condemned it's that there's things that
[13:47] happen and in doing so it will cause a
[13:51] grudge right and I know that we're
[13:54] reading some pretty big stuff here that
[13:56] maybe none of us uh hopefully ever have
[13:58] to encounter but if we could just say
[14:01] it's an offense at the end of the day
[14:03] it's some sort of Deceit or fraud or
[14:05] taken away or taken advantage of we we
[14:07] all can put ourselves in a situation
[14:08] where we feel taken advantage of we feel
[14:10] lied to we feel harmed or offended and
[14:13] this is what gives the con the the
[14:15] unjust actions towards an individual is
[14:17] what causes a grudge in someone's heart
[14:20] brother Brandon makes this statement in
[14:22] D demonology in the Physical Realm uh we
[14:25] looked at how I I was using the
[14:26] nomenclature that hate is a cancer
[14:28] caners and we've seen those words in
[14:30] scripture and even in the message to
[14:33] show us brother says now a cancer what
[14:35] is that fellow what does he represent
[14:38] he's a scavenger he represents the
[14:40] vulture eats dead
[14:42] things and a cancer comes from a bruise
[14:45] mostly where cell's been hit and it
[14:47] breaks up I know there's quite a bit
[14:48] here in what he's saying from an
[14:50] observational or scientific stpoint I I
[14:54] I've been studying on something here
[14:56] recently and how they discovered another
[14:58] or organ in the body and it may explain
[15:00] how can cancers are able to spread and
[15:03] it's very fascinating when brother Bram
[15:05] says the cell it's been hit and it
[15:07] breaks up there's a way that this is
[15:08] transmitted transmitted through the body
[15:10] a little cell in there becomes backslid
[15:13] and notice this little back this little
[15:14] cell backslides when it's
[15:17] bruised now in looking at that and we're
[15:20] not necessarily trying to cabbage down
[15:22] on the scientific explanation because
[15:23] this isn't a scientist that's explaining
[15:25] it to us but it's using a language so
[15:27] that we could understand that something
[15:29] happens a a and there could be a genetic
[15:32] Factor that's triggered through some
[15:33] sort of trauma or some sort of incident
[15:35] or something takes place and so there's
[15:38] and he says there's a bruise there that
[15:39] creates this cancer now I want to take
[15:41] that analogy and show that that's what
[15:43] happens when we're offended it's like a
[15:45] bruise whether it be our ego or our
[15:47] pride or emotions our feelings or some
[15:49] sort of sensitivity gets bruised and
[15:51] that's what begins to break up these
[15:53] cells of hatred within our body and it
[15:55] begins to consume us I want to read this
[15:57] statement I was going to hold it off to
[15:59] the to the end but I I want us to think
[16:02] about this next statement in terms of
[16:04] what God is trying to do through the
[16:05] word to help you he says it begins other
[16:09] little germs run forth to give it give
[16:10] it lives lives lives in there and that's
[16:13] where pus comes in a sore and we know
[16:15] that that's what happens when certain
[16:17] things in the body it's evidence of the
[16:19] body fighting it um even an infection as
[16:21] the body trying to get rid of a foreign
[16:24] uh something foreign or something
[16:26] harmful he said that that's little te
[16:28] teeny little soldiers fighting for in
[16:31] for life for your life they run up there
[16:34] and hit that poison them demon powers
[16:36] that's trying to collect in there and
[16:37] give their lives there are a bunch of
[16:39] little dead soldiers and he says that
[16:41] give their life to save yours so the
[16:44] body starts to try to attack and fight
[16:46] that cancer a there that infection and I
[16:50] believe that God's wanting us what
[16:52] things are wanting to fight against and
[16:54] resist these Notions of hatred we can
[16:57] see how James
[16:59] identifies when things that are
[17:01] rightfully ours are kept back from us
[17:03] when somebody does something to harm us
[17:05] or to offend us that it gives rise to a
[17:08] grudge or feelings of resentment or
[17:10] bitterness it gives rise to hate and so
[17:13] we and I think this beares maybe a
[17:16] little bit
[17:17] more um
[17:19] time
[17:21] but we learn hatred is something that's
[17:24] taught hatred is something that we learn
[17:27] we've learned to hate by how we've seen
[17:29] others respond to
[17:31] offenses or
[17:33] differences we've it's it's something
[17:35] that we have to be taught and learned
[17:36] now it may be instinctual to hate but
[17:39] yet in order to hate something and
[17:42] respond to something there's some
[17:43] learned behavior how to utilize that
[17:45] hate and many times we're we we're
[17:48] hating because we've watched somebody
[17:49] else hate and we've and I guess one of
[17:52] the best examples that I could give
[17:54] that's kind of innocent is I remember
[17:57] one uh very very early on Elliot was
[17:59] running in the house and he ran into a
[18:01] wall or something like that he hid it
[18:02] pretty hard and he began to cry and just
[18:04] in my instinct I wanted him to kind of
[18:07] turn his attention away you know from
[18:09] the pain and kind of resolve it very
[18:11] quickly one of the things you do as a
[18:13] parent when somebody you know one of
[18:14] your kids just jumps off a 13 foot
[18:17] building and lands on the ground and
[18:18] starts to cry you start laughing right
[18:21] because you're like oh nothing's wrong
[18:22] because sometimes it's your it's your
[18:24] response that makes it worse how many
[18:25] times we seen a kid fall down and he
[18:27] looks like he's okay you're like oh my
[18:30] goodness are you okay and they're like
[18:33] maybe I shouldn't be and they start
[18:35] crying so I told Elliot Elliot ran into
[18:37] something I said and he was getting
[18:39] ready to cry or whatever and I said bad
[18:41] wall bad wall you shouldn't do that you
[18:43] know and was going to blame the wall and
[18:44] try to kind of get him to not think
[18:46] about his pain and he just declared war
[18:47] on the wall that's
[18:49] right and I was like whoa wait a minute
[18:53] we're not going to do that
[18:55] anymore and so there's sometimes that's
[18:57] taught it's learned why why do I shake
[19:00] my fist at the guy who cuts me off in
[19:02] traffic because my dad did it you turkey
[19:05] I'm going to run you down you turkey
[19:08] right and you just learn oh that's what
[19:09] you're supposed to do that that oh I
[19:11] didn't know you did that and it's kind
[19:13] of a learned behavior so this hatred
[19:16] sometimes we have it's not that it just
[19:17] comes up and you learn to hate somebody
[19:19] but you saw somebody else's response to
[19:21] an offense and it taught you this is
[19:24] what you do having a conversation with
[19:26] somebody the other day someone parked
[19:28] something on a lot that didn't belong to
[19:30] them and I said and and I said well I'm
[19:32] I'm generally a pretty laid-back guy if
[19:33] they would just ask for permission it
[19:35] wouldn't bother me if they parked it on
[19:36] on my lot if they just asked for
[19:38] permission the guy said I'd just let the
[19:40] air out of the tires and he started
[19:42] going on and on about what he did to
[19:43] somebody on his property and I said man
[19:46] I'm just going to authorize you to take
[19:48] care of it for me and he said I'm just
[19:50] going to go let the air out of their
[19:51] tires I was like well never
[19:52] mind and and he probably does that cuz
[19:54] he learned it from somebody else this is
[19:56] this is how you address these things and
[19:58] handle these things so hate often times
[20:00] and The Grudge I want you to recognize
[20:03] we've learned by others responses to
[20:05] offences or differences and that's more
[20:09] subtle because someone's different than
[20:11] you and lives a little bit differently
[20:13] thinks a little bit differently
[20:14] sometimes we we're instinctively hateful
[20:16] towards them because we've learned that
[20:18] kind of prejudice or bias from somebody
[20:20] else right and Paul says Grudge not
[20:23] against another and in saying that he's
[20:28] and again I hope you've seen where Paul
[20:30] is is saying that excuse me James is
[20:31] showing that this Grudge can be traced
[20:34] back to offensive conduct but he's
[20:36] saying don't do it right you you could
[20:39] in everything we've read we could say
[20:41] James said hey I know you've got a
[20:43] grudge against them and I would do and
[20:45] he's not any says don't do it and I hope
[20:48] you recognize those six verses we've
[20:51] just read as background to him saying
[20:53] Grudge not one against another and when
[20:56] he says against another kind of
[20:58] recognize how that there's a line being
[21:00] drawn whether by conduct or conclusion
[21:02] conduct or opinion uh offenses or
[21:05] differences that there's a line that's
[21:06] being D drawn Grudge not against another
[21:09] so there's there's another here there's
[21:11] you and there's a grudge and that draws
[21:13] a line and that's what hatred does is it
[21:17] draws a line it creates sides and where
[21:20] there is a grudge there's the victim and
[21:22] there's the offender there's the right
[21:24] and there's the wrong and are you able
[21:26] to recognize that when we talk talk
[21:28] about uh uh hate there's you and there's
[21:31] your enemy so hatred kind of draws a
[21:33] line and says if this is where you are
[21:35] if you're not if you're not for us uh
[21:38] you're against us and and so this it
[21:40] draws a line This conduct against uh
[21:43] whether it be difference or conduct has
[21:45] caused you your hatred will draw a line
[21:47] and say we're we're opposed we're at
[21:50] odds and in James chapter
[21:53] 3: 14 to 18 Again James is dealing with
[21:58] this already in this book there's a lot
[22:00] he's dealing with in terms of these
[22:01] emotions he said but if you have bitter
[22:03] envying and strife that envying is a
[22:06] precursor to hate a lot of times we hate
[22:09] the ones that we Envy or that we're
[22:10] jealous of and there Strife it's
[22:13] electioneering it means to court
[22:14] courting a a distinction
[22:17] partisanship it's party making creating
[22:20] factions and so this is this is what
[22:22] he's describing here where you create
[22:24] sides through uh bitter envy and bitter
[22:28] Strife to have The Strife is to create
[22:30] sides you right them
[22:33] wrong that's that's what's being created
[22:36] here is these sides if you have bitter
[22:38] envy and strife in your hearts Glory not
[22:40] and lie not against the truth which
[22:43] means don't justify it as being true or
[22:46] justify it as being right a and I think
[22:49] we mentioned this before that hatred is
[22:51] kind of predicated upon uh there being
[22:53] uh one group that feels one way or you
[22:56] being in a particular position position
[22:58] and something else being in a contrary
[23:00] position that's kind of where hatred is
[23:02] it it builds off of different groups or
[23:05] parties in verse 15 now this wisdom of
[23:10] This Bitter envy and strife and
[23:12] justifying it he says that wisdom to
[23:14] justify it is right to justify it is
[23:16] just uh um just he says this wisdom
[23:19] descendeth not from above but is Earthly
[23:23] sensual
[23:24] devilish for where envy and and strife
[23:27] is is there is confusion in every evil
[23:30] work then we could sum that up in terms
[23:32] of hatred bitterness resentment envy and
[23:35] and strife parter making politic and
[23:37] factions these clicks that are created
[23:39] they're against and why is it created
[23:40] because there's differences or
[23:42] something's been done and you have to
[23:43] take sides he says but the wisdom that
[23:45] is from above is first pure then
[23:48] Peaceable gentle and easy to be
[23:50] entreated full of mercy and good fruits
[23:53] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[23:55] and the fruit of righteousness is swn in
[23:57] PE peace of them that make
[24:00] peace so much just being expressed here
[24:02] that we could begin to hold on to and
[24:04] touch on and hopefully we can get
[24:06] through some of this tonight but we read
[24:08] already in Proverbs 10:12 that hatred
[24:11] stirreth up stries but love
[24:15] coverthe are the opposing Natures that
[24:17] are being opened up here in James
[24:19] chapter 3 there's a hatred that just
[24:21] keeps stirring things up it's not going
[24:23] to let it go it it's not going to leave
[24:25] it and let it go it's not going to
[24:26] forgive it's not going to let by G be
[24:28] bygones it's just going to uh uh it's
[24:30] just going to keep bringing it up I
[24:32] remember one time having a conversation
[24:34] with somebody and uh and and we're
[24:37] wanting to work through something and
[24:38] kind of one of their first things that
[24:39] they said is I don't keep score I don't
[24:41] keep a scoreboard I don't keep track of
[24:42] this uh so don't worry about it there's
[24:45] nothing I'm not always writing this kind
[24:47] of stuff down and then you get a little
[24:48] bit in the conversation it's like well
[24:49] just hold on one
[24:50] [Music]
[24:52] minute they just start going through all
[24:54] the things they're keeping track of and
[24:56] so there's a hatred that keeps that
[24:58] stirs it up it's never going to let it
[25:00] go but there is a love that
[25:04] coverthe not that it's not keeping track
[25:06] but it's just not something that's
[25:07] wanting to expose and drag out so these
[25:09] are opposing natures and I'm wanting to
[25:12] use and I know it's convenient but I'm W
[25:14] to use hate to kind of sum up a lot of
[25:15] these feelings that we're identifying
[25:17] but the Bible's saying that this kind of
[25:19] wisdom that's Has This Bitter envy and
[25:21] bitter Strife it is sensual subject to
[25:25] human appetites and passions uh it's
[25:28] animalistic calls it devilish and
[25:30] Earthly so it's from an evil influence
[25:32] it's from beneath it's part of our based
[25:34] instincts it's part of an instinct that
[25:36] every human is subject to just by being
[25:38] born of a woman so it's it cannot be
[25:41] attributed to righteous indignation
[25:43] cannot be attributed to Godly hate
[25:45] there's a hate there's a bitter envy and
[25:46] a jealousy because God says I'm I'm God
[25:48] jealous over you with The Godly jealousy
[25:50] but this is a different kind but then
[25:53] this wisdom that's spoken of here the
[25:55] Bible says it's gentle so it's patient
[25:58] it's Equitable to be gentle it's willing
[26:00] to
[26:01] yield it it seeks peace as the Bible's
[26:04] expounding upon it here that it's uh it
[26:07] is the fruits of righteousness is sown
[26:09] in peace of them that make peace it
[26:11] seeks peace rather than hostility it's
[26:15] anti-hate it it doesn't it's actually
[26:18] going to act opposite to what hate does
[26:20] hate stir up Strife whereas this love
[26:22] and this other mindset and this wisdom
[26:24] from above is looking to plate wrath
[26:28] looking to settle things and quiet
[26:30] things down it doesn't want to Stir It
[26:31] Up it wants to quiet things down and and
[26:35] so we could look at it hates the
[26:37] instigator but this wisdom from above is
[26:39] The Peacemaker and so if we could put
[26:41] ourselves at the table that we are
[26:43] reading about in Proverbs on Sunday
[26:45] where it's you know better to have a dry
[26:48] morsel better just to eat herbs right
[26:50] grown out of the ground with peace and
[26:52] Tranquility than it is to eat fat and
[26:55] fattened Ox out where there's hatred
[26:58] right cuz why hatred is going to be
[26:59] there at the table just looking for an
[27:01] opportunity to provoke look at them over
[27:05] there right and and poking and maybe
[27:08] something said and it looks like a
[27:09] misunderstanding and people start
[27:10] getting heated and there's a little bit
[27:12] of an argument uh the wisdom from above
[27:14] said oh you know what let's not worry
[27:16] about it I'm sorry that's my fault let's
[27:18] move on let's talk about this later or
[27:20] seeks to immediate peace uh but hates
[27:23] over there going they always do this
[27:25] don't they this is just like them this
[27:28] is so on brand for them didn't they do
[27:30] this to you last year are you going to
[27:32] let them get away with
[27:33] that it's just looking to Stir It Up and
[27:35] keep it going and maybe make the day
[27:37] entertaining for them but there's it's
[27:40] but peace is
[27:41] anti-hate because it doesn't want to see
[27:43] The Strife it doesn't want to see the
[27:45] things that come from it and the Bible
[27:46] is saying that the fruit of
[27:48] righteousness is sown in Peace by them
[27:50] that make peace and other words this
[27:52] mature fruit is first planted in Peace
[27:55] by those who are seeking peace amen not
[27:57] seeking to divide not wanting to promote
[28:00] Strife or to tear down or harm somebody
[28:03] or to shame somebody got to be very
[28:06] careful to guard against even the seeds
[28:07] of hate because the Instinct of hate is
[28:09] to shame belittle and
[28:12] degrade the Bible says in Proverbs 15: 1
[28:15] and 2 a soft answer turneth away wrath
[28:18] but Grievous words stir up anger that's
[28:23] hate hate that's what a grudge will do
[28:26] but a soft answer turns away the
[28:29] Wrath where there's hatred hatred wants
[28:32] to promote hate hate I wants to breed
[28:33] more hate hate has that power to provoke
[28:37] and to birth hate inside of you we've
[28:39] seen that in the scriptures if someone's
[28:40] hating you it's going to try to bring
[28:42] hate out of you so it's saying soft
[28:44] answer will turn that away but Grievous
[28:46] words are going to stir up anger it's
[28:47] even showing that the words that are
[28:49] being spoken to you are trying to stir
[28:51] up angering you so the only way to
[28:53] diffuse it is not to respond with fire
[28:56] but to respond with a soft
[28:58] answer so it says the tongue of the wise
[29:01] useth knowledge or right but the mouths
[29:03] of fools porth out
[29:05] foolishness so much that could be said
[29:07] here even how it amplifies what's said
[29:10] in James chapter 3 but there's a sensual
[29:12] devilish nature that's going to uh fire
[29:15] things off it's going to respond in an
[29:17] attack it's going to get angry right
[29:18] back but saying there's a wisdom from
[29:20] above that is pure Peaceable gentle easy
[29:23] to be entreated full of mercy and good
[29:24] fruits without partiality and without
[29:26] hypocrisy
[29:27] and that's the tongue of the wise which
[29:29] uses knowledge correctly I think the way
[29:31] that we described this before when we
[29:33] used this scripture a couple years ago
[29:35] was that in this situation where there's
[29:38] there's some wrath there's some
[29:39] disagreement there's some contention it
[29:41] says a soft answer turns it away whereas
[29:43] Grievous words are just going to Stir It
[29:44] Up more and the tongue of the wise uses
[29:46] knowledge correctly it's that in it may
[29:49] not be instinctive but it's that
[29:51] ultimate response that overcomes all the
[29:53] fleshly responses in order to get
[29:55] beneath and live above it yeah in other
[29:58] words get beneath and live above get
[30:00] beneath the person who's angry because
[30:02] you want to get beneath because they're
[30:03] already Bas right they're already doing
[30:05] something they shouldn't do they're
[30:06] they're they're stirred up so instead of
[30:08] you kind of punching them down and
[30:09] punching down at them you try to get
[30:11] beneath them to lift them up through the
[30:14] soft answer by by humbling yourself to
[30:16] them and by getting beneath them you're
[30:18] living above
[30:19] it I hope you can catch that thought
[30:21] about living above something it it it's
[30:24] the grace and patience that we can never
[30:26] have too much of when there's conflict
[30:27] in relationships Bible saying there's a
[30:29] harvest of righteousness correct
[30:31] Behavior it's planted by those who are
[30:34] acting patiently and
[30:37] gracefully they're seeking peace and
[30:39] Accord they're wanting they're to
[30:41] wanting
[30:42] rest I think there's uh times when we
[30:45] just whether it be the way that we've
[30:46] been raised or the way that we've
[30:47] experienced certain things in lives
[30:49] where it's almost as if we find some
[30:51] sort of familiarity and contention that
[30:54] there's always got to be something going
[30:55] on there's always got to be an edge
[30:56] there's always got to be a difference
[30:57] there's always got to be fighting and we
[30:59] really need to watch out for that to
[31:00] where no I I want to have the kind of
[31:02] nature that's seeking rest and
[31:04] quietness not not I don't want to be the
[31:06] kind of person that I don't feel like
[31:08] I'm at home unless there's an argument
[31:09] going
[31:10] on and some of you might just say well
[31:12] it's not that's what home is there's
[31:15] always a fight but we want to be those
[31:16] that seek peace and Accord and the Bible
[31:20] says here as we're reading through this
[31:21] in James that it is wisdom from above
[31:27] and so it's describing here in James
[31:29] chter 3:1 17 the the characteristics of
[31:32] wisdom and what it's known by it's known
[31:35] by these
[31:36] attributes and I would like to look at
[31:38] it this
[31:39] way that Paul is excuse me I keep
[31:43] calling him Paul maybe his middle name
[31:44] is Paul James Paul he's not he's wanting
[31:48] us to recognize and I it's not an either
[31:51] or proposition I believe he's
[31:53] challenging us to say you could if you
[31:55] want respond with in a fleshly way that
[31:59] that's just going to be natural and
[32:01] instinctive that he said don't the
[32:03] bitter envy and strife he's said that
[32:05] would be expected based upon the things
[32:08] that can happen to you as he gets to it
[32:10] in chapter five defraud and deceit and
[32:12] killing the just and all sorts of line
[32:14] and things that take place see you can
[32:15] get bitter because of that you could
[32:17] Envy you could have Strife you could
[32:19] party make you could do all these things
[32:20] be saying don't do it because that's
[32:22] Earthly that's carnal that's of an evil
[32:24] influence but rather use this wisdom
[32:27] which is from above and the picture that
[32:29] it paints for me as he talks about
[32:31] meekness we know that meekness is power
[32:32] under control when you have meekness
[32:34] I've got power to Snuff you out but I'm
[32:37] not going to do it I've got power to
[32:39] clock you and knock you out I can break
[32:41] your jaw I can do this to you I can let
[32:42] all the air out of your tires right but
[32:44] I'm not going to do it because I'm Meek
[32:46] not because I'm weak but because I can
[32:49] that's meekness it describes to me
[32:52] self-control that is that is what's
[32:54] being expressed on this is the ability
[32:56] to regulate your emotions and it's not
[32:59] that you're like I'm just numb to it man
[33:01] you can just do whatever you want to me
[33:02] I don't feel it I'm not going to Envy
[33:04] I'm not going to be jealous you just
[33:05] might be dead inside right that's why
[33:07] you don't hate you're just dead inside
[33:10] and but yet we're talking about
[33:11] something where I feel this I'm being
[33:13] provoked I I see the unjustness and
[33:15] there's a self-control that is the
[33:17] opposite of hate that says instead of
[33:19] letting this become a raging wildfire in
[33:22] my emotions I'm going to regulate and
[33:24] I'm going to yield to a higher power and
[33:26] I'm going to cause it to snuff out these
[33:28] feelings and it says this wisdom is
[33:30] first pure which is clear it inspires
[33:32] this reverence it's pure it's free from
[33:34] carnality it's not Earthly it's not
[33:37] sensual it's not devilish it's modest
[33:40] it's clean now as I read through these
[33:42] I'm want you to recognize how this is
[33:45] opposite of hate because hate defiles
[33:47] it's dirty says it's Peaceable that's
[33:49] clearly the opposite of hate because it
[33:51] means it promotes peace it desires peace
[33:53] it desires agreement and it's willing to
[33:56] SA sacrifice personally for it as we
[33:59] read where David said and I and I gave
[34:02] what I gave back what I didn't take away
[34:04] what for peace so sometimes there's
[34:07] compromise and there's concession for
[34:09] the sake of Peace willing to personally
[34:11] sacrifice to have it it's gentle it's
[34:13] modest it's making a um it's something
[34:17] that makes a person understanding and
[34:19] patient not rigid not harsh not Stern
[34:21] not unrelenting what just won't budge
[34:24] and won't let it go a brother shared
[34:27] something in uh a minister a pastor in
[34:30] uh Oklahoma Missouri shared
[34:33] something and uh and he a brother had
[34:36] shared a quote just this week and it
[34:37] really I thought it was really good I
[34:39] just read it today said he preached a
[34:41] sermon one time called God's Judo and
[34:43] that Judo I guess means gentle or
[34:46] gentleness how the and if I get this
[34:48] wrong to you martial arts experts here
[34:50] you could just kind of clear it up later
[34:51] and I'll be sure to let this brother
[34:52] know he got it wrong but he said that
[34:54] Judo has its roots or emology and
[34:56] gentleness are being gentle and how that
[34:58] in Judo uh you're using your opponent's
[35:00] for energy and force against it you kind
[35:03] of go with the motions and you're you're
[35:05] doing something in a way where you're
[35:06] not getting wore out but they're
[35:07] exerting themselves and use use their
[35:09] energy against them it made me think of
[35:11] this gentleness to where where there's
[35:13] hatred and animosity that's being
[35:15] projected towards you you just find a
[35:16] way to roll with it and move in such a
[35:18] way where they're going to project all
[35:19] their energy but you're not going to let
[35:21] it bring take out
[35:22] yours it's to be modest easily intreated
[35:25] willing to listen not stubborn or sour
[35:28] means someone's a good listener and
[35:30] they're responsive to what they're
[35:31] hearing full of Mercy you're quick to
[35:33] forgive you act kindly it exhibits some
[35:36] sort of compassion uh you're willing to
[35:38] relieve whatever burden they're going
[35:40] through notice just how different of a
[35:42] response a soft answer turns away wrath
[35:44] Grudge not and this wisdom that's from
[35:46] above it it's there's self-control I'm
[35:48] not going to be provoked but I'm going
[35:50] to be full of Mercy not going to be
[35:52] provoked I'm going to be full of good
[35:53] fruits and so each one of these
[35:55] dispositions is manifest in action it
[35:57] produces an action it's full of good
[36:00] fruits without partiality in other words
[36:01] it's not
[36:02] self-righteous it's not influence by
[36:06] self-interest where you're going to hold
[36:07] back you're going to restrain it's going
[36:09] to give what is due it's not going to
[36:11] it's going to be merciful it's going to
[36:12] be without partiality without hypocrisy
[36:14] it's not self- serving without gu it
[36:17] seeks nothing but God's
[36:19] glory this is this is quite a contrast
[36:22] to hatred pure Peaceable gentle easy to
[36:25] be entreated full of Mercy full of good
[36:27] fruits without partiality without
[36:28] hypocrisy I could argue that every
[36:30] single one of these things hate is anti-
[36:32] too it's not pure it's not Peaceable
[36:35] it's not gentle it's not easy to be in
[36:36] treated it's not full of Mercy not full
[36:37] of good fruits it's not without
[36:39] partiality it's not without
[36:40] hypocrisy I think the more you think
[36:42] about it the more you're going to say
[36:43] Amen to
[36:45] it maybe just in about 20 minutes when
[36:47] it's quiet somebody's like amen I get
[36:52] it now this is connecting with a lot of
[36:55] the things we've been expressing
[36:58] as do not Grudge do not hate when
[37:01] there's an offense do not let the
[37:02] offense or even the overt hate that you
[37:06] endure provoke you to hate the
[37:10] offender this is a clear admonition in
[37:12] the scripture don't do it it's not clean
[37:14] it's not pure it's not good for you it's
[37:16] not healthy that where there's hate
[37:18] projected to you don't don't give hate
[37:20] back where there's an offense to you
[37:23] don't offend back don't give evil for
[37:25] evil but over come evil with good this
[37:27] is the picture constantly painted in the
[37:29] scripture and James is saying Grudge not
[37:33] against another Brethren lest you be
[37:36] condemned behold the judge standeth
[37:39] before the door now I I kind of flip
[37:40] this around a little bit to and I'll
[37:42] come back to this condemnation he says
[37:44] the judge standeth at the door don't let
[37:47] an offense don't let offenses or
[37:48] differences or even hate provoke you to
[37:51] hate the one that is different the
[37:53] offender or the hatred because the judge
[37:56] standeth at the door there's somebody
[38:00] watching now I could take that and
[38:03] project it in a way and place it
[38:05] correctly in a way that says there's a
[38:07] judge that's watching you and watching
[38:09] your actions and watching how you
[38:11] respond and don't think for a second
[38:14] that you can have that in your heart and
[38:15] justify it and say oh no I'm I'm just
[38:19] the judge standeth at the door and
[38:21] there's a picture then of this judge
[38:22] watching out over his children saying
[38:24] that's Unbecoming conduct that's
[38:26] becoming conduct and we could go that
[38:28] way but since things have been so heavy
[38:30] lately I want to take a little bit
[38:32] different approach on this because it's
[38:33] just as much of the meaning as that
[38:35] would be is saying there's one
[38:38] watching the judge standeth at the door
[38:42] and there's one who knows the offense
[38:45] who knows the difference who knows the
[38:48] hate there's one watching that you
[38:50] should
[38:52] trust in other words where's the
[38:54] confidence Grudge not not against
[38:57] somebody else lest you be condemned so
[38:58] it's it's showing the condemnation that
[39:00] comes but it says the judge standeth at
[39:02] the door not just for your condemnation
[39:04] but also for your confidence that you
[39:07] could yes there is a judge that's
[39:08] watching there is a righteous God that I
[39:11] am I am part of that I'm one with that
[39:13] is looking at the situation and he's the
[39:16] one I should be trusting I hope you can
[39:18] stay close to this thought now as we
[39:20] move forward in Romans 12: 19 dearly
[39:23] beloved avenge not yourselves but rather
[39:26] give place under
[39:28] wrath now there that such a beautiful
[39:31] picture give place under wrath it
[39:32] doesn't mean the Wrath in your heart but
[39:34] you've got to accept that God is the one
[39:37] that will avenge God is the one that
[39:39] will judge and if you act you can
[39:42] actually take God's justice off of that
[39:44] person if you try to seek your own
[39:46] Revenge God may say all right you picked
[39:48] your you picked your punishment I
[39:50] watched a clip one time where they asked
[39:52] this man at is sentencing he claimed he
[39:54] was innocent I'm going to commit all my
[39:55] powers and everything I have in my mind
[39:57] I'm going to commit it to finding the
[39:59] killer so the judge said okay well that
[40:01] killer the one that did this what do you
[40:03] think they should get he goes I don't
[40:05] think they should ever breathe another
[40:06] breath and he goes I sentence you to
[40:08] life and that he got what he was asking
[40:11] for and so there's a there's something
[40:13] where we're trying to get that kind of
[40:15] Vengeance we're kinding to kind of get
[40:16] that kind of justice but God would be
[40:18] the kind of person oh you've exacted a
[40:19] measure of Revenge fine you want to go
[40:22] your way I can't do anything it's saying
[40:23] give place to wrath those let God deal
[40:25] with the sit situation let the one to
[40:28] whom it is just to act the one is just
[40:30] to respond let him act for it is written
[40:32] vengeance is mine I will repay sayith
[40:35] the Lord verse 14 of that very chapter
[40:37] bless them which persecute you bless and
[40:39] curse not so where there's persecution
[40:42] where there's revilings where there's
[40:43] hatred where there's offense where
[40:45] there's a a defrauding where there's
[40:46] something been taken away from you don't
[40:48] put it upon yourselves or take it under
[40:50] your own power to get back at them if
[40:53] they've lied they oh they're going to
[40:55] get it Bud you're going to get it I'm
[40:57] going to get them back says don't act
[41:00] don't avenge yourselves and in other
[41:02] words don't take
[41:03] Vengeance now if you want an example of
[41:06] Vengeance this this to me puts it in
[41:08] terms I actually wrote the scenario out
[41:10] so that we could have I could have it
[41:11] here to work through it this is an
[41:14] illustration of
[41:16] Vengeance let's say that you're you're a
[41:19] daughter in a family and you have some
[41:21] siblings you have some brothers maybe
[41:22] three brothers and your brother asked
[41:24] you to borrow a pencil the brother says
[41:28] no and so then there's some offense
[41:30] there you just want a pencil there's
[41:31] hundreds of them they're right there on
[41:33] your desk and this didn't happen today
[41:35] but you can I'm certainly there's a
[41:36] lesson to be learned by by my children
[41:39] Jack's giving me a thumbs up okay your
[41:41] brother asked to borrow a pencil and he
[41:44] says no so then later on your brother
[41:46] asked to borrow a book and this is
[41:49] Vengeance because you wouldn't let me
[41:51] borrow a book I'm not going to or borrow
[41:54] a pencil I'm not going to let you borrow
[41:56] borrow a book come on
[41:58] somebody that's Vengeance that is
[42:01] exactly what vengeance is now I know in
[42:03] your mind you were thinking if somebody
[42:05] kills your mom you kill their mom and
[42:07] their dad right if somebody dings your
[42:10] car you slash all their tires IND Dent
[42:12] every Fender and in your mind you're
[42:14] thinking that's what Vengeance Is Right
[42:16] vengeance is to really get something
[42:18] from somebody but vengeance is just as
[42:20] simple as oh because you didn't do it
[42:22] for me I'm not going to do it for you
[42:24] you're not nice to me why should I bece
[42:26] to you that's Vengeance now I know we're
[42:28] thinking to protect our self-interest
[42:30] come on kids listen to me now I know
[42:32] we're thinking that we're just
[42:33] protecting our own self-interest and you
[42:35] won't let me do this and you won't let
[42:36] me do that and because you won't let me
[42:37] do this you won't let me do that I'm
[42:39] going to respond to you that is what
[42:41] vengeance is you're getting back at them
[42:44] and to me from my vantage point even
[42:47] though I'm guilty of the same it doesn't
[42:49] make any sense because you just
[42:52] reinforce that kind of negative dynamic
[42:55] because the next time you go go back to
[42:56] borrow pencil because you didn't let me
[42:58] borrow the
[42:59] book I'm letting you Bor not letting you
[43:01] borrow the pencil and she's like but no
[43:03] I didn't let you borrow the book because
[43:04] you didn't let me borrow the pencil it's
[43:06] like but now I'm not letting you borrow
[43:08] my pencil because you wouldn't let me
[43:09] borrow the book and everybody just
[43:10] pointing at each other right and the
[43:12] next thing is dad ground them they won't
[43:15] let me borrow the pencil it's like nope
[43:17] I've got a rule now when they ask for
[43:19] punishment
[43:20] nothing when they tell me what to do
[43:23] nothing I just need some noise canc and
[43:26] headphones I'm not going to do a thing
[43:28] cuz you can't make me you can't tell me
[43:30] what to do tell them to stop bugging me
[43:33] nope tell them to leave me alone nope so
[43:36] there's a there's this is really
[43:38] practical right there's now now if you
[43:41] could just instead of just humoring
[43:43] ourselves about the kids what about us
[43:44] as Petty adults
[43:46] sometimes and how we act out our
[43:49] Vengeance in other ways right the Bible
[43:53] says it this way in Exodus 23:5 if thou
[43:56] see the ass of him that hateth thee
[43:58] lying under his burden so a man has his
[44:01] Beast a burden his donkey falling on him
[44:03] and what US forbear to help him and
[44:05] other words you're not going to help him
[44:07] Thou shalt surely help
[44:09] him this ties into love your neighbor as
[44:12] yourself and not just love your neighbor
[44:13] but love your enemy because if you see
[44:15] the one that hates
[44:17] you hurting and in need it says Thou
[44:21] shalt surely help
[44:23] him why why would we do it because it's
[44:27] Vengeance isn't ours when someone hates
[44:30] you like that's a guy that hates me
[44:32] that's a guy that stole that's a guy
[44:33] that did this that's a guy that did that
[44:35] that's not your opportunity to be like
[44:37] right it's in that moment he says you
[44:40] should surely help him why the judge
[44:43] standeth at the door the judge knows
[44:46] that's not your chance to get him back
[44:48] that's not your chance for justice the
[44:50] Lord is at the door and he will defend
[44:52] his own he will avenge his own avenge
[44:56] not yourselves don't try to even the
[44:58] score give place to God to give the
[45:00] Vengeance I will repay sayith the Lord
[45:03] this is what James is drawing from AKA
[45:05] known as Paul tonight this is what he's
[45:06] drawing from when he says the judge
[45:08] standeth at the
[45:09] door why does he tell us that lest you
[45:12] be condemned when he says it there
[45:15] in verse 9 but look at verse six also
[45:19] where it says ye have condemned the
[45:20] unjust man the rich man you've condemned
[45:22] and killed the just but now there's
[45:25] condemnation there's killing there's
[45:26] murder there's defrauding there's LIE
[45:28] there's pain there's offenses there
[45:29] differences but he says don't Grudge
[45:32] don't hate back lest you be condemned
[45:35] also hate subjects you to
[45:38] condemnation hate will subject you to
[45:40] judgment and if I could just put it this
[45:42] way the reason why at the very least is
[45:44] oftentimes your hate causes you to
[45:47] respond with the same offense to which
[45:49] you've
[45:50] endured someone lies you you word use
[45:52] words right back and so whatever
[45:54] punishment was just for this them is
[45:56] truly just for you amen I like how
[45:59] they're starting to identify the kind of
[46:01] the logical fallacies that exist in
[46:03] politics that now there's going to be
[46:04] the death penalty for
[46:06] abortion for doctors that could perform
[46:08] it was being threatened in other words
[46:09] life is so valuable let's just give the
[46:11] death penalty to the guy who takes it
[46:13] that's what hate will
[46:15] do it blinds us to all these fallacies
[46:19] hate subject you to
[46:21] condemnation cuz hate comes with the
[46:23] price it's true brother holding on to
[46:25] resent anger we've already dealt with
[46:26] this in the cancer the canker side of it
[46:28] it it's painful and harmful for yourself
[46:32] brother brandom I I think I read this in
[46:33] part one or part two brother says notice
[46:35] how organization breeds hatred I think
[46:37] it was part two organization breeds
[46:39] hatred now that shows you the
[46:41] organization in other words you draw a
[46:43] line and you organize so you create your
[46:46] party there's The Strife there's the
[46:48] grouping together and it I it
[46:50] distinguishes itself we're an org we're
[46:52] an organization cuz we believe this he
[46:54] says it breeds ha hatred by virtue of
[46:57] carving yourself out it breeds hatred
[47:00] because now there's the ingroup and
[47:02] there's the out group there's the in
[47:04] party there's the in Click there's the
[47:05] cool kids and then there's the Geeks or
[47:07] whatever it carves things out he says it
[47:09] destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness
[47:12] hatred destroys Fellowship hatred makes
[47:14] bitter and he said a roote of bitterness
[47:16] defiles many so more and more
[47:17] defilements coming into that age smna he
[47:20] says every age would fill its scars why
[47:22] because of
[47:24] hatred hatred subjects you to
[47:26] condemnation judgment pain hardship it
[47:28] destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness
[47:31] so by yielding to the spirit of anger
[47:33] and hate you come under the
[47:35] condemnation of the
[47:37] wicked the judge standeth at the
[47:40] door in other words you could either
[47:42] come under the hate and be condemned or
[47:44] you could see the judge and yield
[47:47] yourself to the
[47:49] judge James is saying don't trouble
[47:51] yourself with hate the Bible said leave
[47:53] it in the hands of God don't don't
[47:55] trouble yourself with it if you pick up
[47:58] the mantle of hate you assume the
[48:00] responsibility to deal with it to deal
[48:03] with the offense to deal with the issue
[48:06] to deal with the difference when we take
[48:08] that kind of mantle you're going to
[48:10] confront it you're going to take care of
[48:12] it you're going to make things right
[48:14] you're going to even the score he says
[48:15] leave it in the hands of God if I can
[48:17] put it this way don't trust in
[48:18] yourself don't take it upon yourself
[48:21] don't anoint yourself as the Avenger
[48:23] don't anoint yourself as the leveler
[48:24] don't anoint yourself as the one that's
[48:25] going to even the score I I that it's
[48:28] not yours to
[48:30] do live above the Hate by trust in the
[48:32] Lord amen and not don't trust in your
[48:36] flesh and your own ideas that somehow
[48:38] you can level the playing field that you
[48:40] can make right what's been wrong I hope
[48:42] that this can come out in a little bit
[48:43] clear picture now is I need to
[48:45] transition for time sake that there's a
[48:47] certain idea that we convince ourselves
[48:49] when we hate that I know how to make
[48:50] this right I know how to deal with this
[48:52] I know how to get back at them I know
[48:54] how to protect myself and you're not
[48:56] trust in the Lord you're trus in
[48:57] yourself and that's why you utilize the
[49:00] emotion of hate is you've somehow
[49:02] convinced yourself that you can make
[49:03] better than God can Amen in Philippians
[49:06] chapter 3: 3 and 4 for we are the
[49:08] circumcision which worship God in the
[49:10] spirit and and rejoice in Christ Jesus
[49:13] and have no confidence in the flesh
[49:16] quite a distinction and he's bringing
[49:18] that contrast though I might also have
[49:20] confidence in the flesh if any other man
[49:22] thinketh that he hath whereof he might
[49:24] Trust In the Flesh I more here Paul also
[49:28] known as James he would argue that I of
[49:32] everybody have more reason to trust in
[49:34] myself than any of you but I'm not going
[49:37] to do it amen I will not have any
[49:40] confidence in the flesh I will not trust
[49:44] in some perceived Advantage as Paul
[49:46] begins to give his resume if I have
[49:48] reason to think that I've got a better
[49:49] response than you I if I I have reason
[49:52] to do that because look at my resume if
[49:54] anyone has reason to to boast that they
[49:56] could do this I could I have no reason
[49:58] to trust in some sort of perceived
[50:00] advantage or some sort of higher opinion
[50:02] or proposition that I'm in the right I'm
[50:05] more just I'm more correct wasn't not
[50:08] David that when he was reviled against
[50:10] he said pre-venture God made him do it
[50:13] and didn't suppose himself that oh
[50:15] everything every offense and every wrong
[50:17] is just the devil acting a contrary
[50:19] against God's will he says pre-venture
[50:21] that God allowed it that's a way of
[50:22] diffusing the hate diffusing the retri
[50:25] tion not escalating the
[50:29] conflict we should not have confidence
[50:31] in our own sense of
[50:34] justice just think of how few people
[50:37] would exist on Earth
[50:39] today if we we could just act on our
[50:42] hate
[50:44] Justified but we should have no
[50:46] confidence in the flesh let's look at
[50:49] psalms 27 now in this
[50:52] light in this vantage point this
[50:54] perspective of
[50:59] hatred collecting together and Gathering
[51:01] Together Grudge not against another lest
[51:04] you be condemned the judge standeth at
[51:06] the door so you can choose hatred or you
[51:09] could choose the
[51:10] judge not for judgment but for
[51:13] confidence for justice for vengeance for
[51:16] your rest for your peace of mind for
[51:18] your health for your
[51:21] safety taking all the things that James
[51:24] talked about the things that would cause
[51:26] The Grudge the bitter envy and strife
[51:29] versus the wisdom that's from
[51:31] above the confidence where's the
[51:33] confidence David says this the Lord is
[51:36] my
[51:37] light and my
[51:40] salvation Whom Shall I
[51:43] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[51:48] of whom shall I be
[51:49] afraid these questions are rhetorical in
[51:53] the sense that the answer ought to be
[51:56] obvious we should not read these and be
[51:58] like wow that's a really good question
[51:59] um the Lord is your light and your
[52:01] salvation Whom Shall you fear Now who is
[52:03] the worst boss like who would be who's
[52:06] that demon or that devil or that villain
[52:09] that you should be afraid of and there's
[52:10] not a there's not an exercise to be done
[52:12] here the answer is no one that's right
[52:16] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[52:17] whom shall I be afraid well I think I
[52:20] think you should be afraid of the Hulk
[52:23] or I you should be afraid of a disease
[52:25] you should be afraid of poverty the
[52:28] answer is nothing no one it's assumed
[52:32] and now let's we kind of put ourselves
[52:34] in the throws of the brother who's not
[52:36] able to borrow the book because he
[52:37] didn't loan a pencil it kind of gets
[52:39] serious he says when the wicked even
[52:41] mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to
[52:43] eat of My Flesh they stumbled and fell
[52:45] though an H should encamp against me my
[52:47] heart shall not fear now that fear is
[52:49] really key to hatred I'll probably pick
[52:52] up on it maybe on Sunday or next
[52:53] Wednesday my heart shall not fear fear
[52:55] cuz he's saying Whom Shall I Fear who
[52:56] shall I be afraid of he's showing these
[52:58] contrasted emotions in the light of this
[53:00] aggression that's being shown to him the
[53:02] war should Rise Against Me hostility
[53:06] animosity bitterness resentment hatred
[53:08] coming against you someone who thinks
[53:10] they've got a just cause to tear you
[53:11] down you're wrong you shouldn't be doing
[53:13] this to me instead of hating he says in
[53:15] this will I be confident wow he's
[53:18] actually addressing those things which
[53:20] provocate while giving us the secret to
[53:22] overcoming it cuz here here's the
[53:26] enemy they that hated him those that
[53:29] would seek his ruin desire to see him
[53:32] fail it's not a sibling who feels that
[53:36] they have been unjustly deprived of a
[53:37] writing utensil it's not a sibling who
[53:40] feels agreed because they have been
[53:42] deprived of something to read while they
[53:44] were bored this is someone who realizes
[53:46] this is an enemy that seeks to see me
[53:48] fail they want to eat up my flesh they
[53:49] want to destroy me they want to take my
[53:51] life away they want to take my family
[53:52] away they want to take my health away
[53:54] this is one like James 5 who's going to
[53:56] cause me to work work work work work and
[53:58] then never pay me and shouldn't I Grudge
[54:00] them shouldn't I hate them shouldn't I
[54:01] get back at
[54:03] them like in other words if you built a
[54:05] portico or put in a a sun room for
[54:07] somebody and they didn't pay you just go
[54:08] tear it down right I put it in going to
[54:11] show up with a bulldozer just tear it
[54:14] out write a will from somebody they
[54:16] don't pay you sneak into the house open
[54:18] up their safe and burn it that way when
[54:21] they die none of their heirs get what
[54:23] they want you they're going they asked
[54:24] for
[54:27] hey he says in this will I be
[54:30] confident think of the cuz in big ways
[54:33] and small ways we're provoked to
[54:36] hate in big ways and small ways we can
[54:39] build a resentment and grudges and
[54:41] bitterness and sometimes it could just
[54:42] be Pebble upon Pebble sometimes it's big
[54:44] huge Stones sometimes it's big huge
[54:46] wounds but other times it just may be a
[54:47] little bit nitpick nitpicking and
[54:49] sometimes just enough just enough
[54:51] needling right eventually right unless
[54:53] you're an acupuncturist don't need
[54:55] needle somebody just a little bit of a
[54:57] needling all of a sudden it just causes
[54:59] a blow up because in big and small ways
[55:01] we can be building up but I I say this
[55:04] and I say this with confidence and if I
[55:08] if if the the truth of this is lost in
[55:10] the way that I phrase it I I I apologize
[55:13] but there's really no circumstances
[55:14] under which we're Justified to hold on
[55:16] to hate this kind of
[55:20] hate but
[55:22] David also known as Paul James
[55:25] he says some very strong things about
[55:28] what these people are doing to hate to
[55:29] destroy him in Psalms 109: 1-5 hold not
[55:32] thy peace oh god of my
[55:35] praise for the mouth of the wicked and
[55:38] the mouth of the deceitful are open
[55:39] against me they have spoken against me
[55:41] with a lying tongue they've compassed me
[55:44] about also with words of hatred and have
[55:47] fought against Me Without a
[55:51] Cause when David is being
[55:54] surrounded and maybe this complicates it
[55:57] that when we it would I think that it
[56:00] would complicate it or maybe how how can
[56:03] I say this this resolves some sort of
[56:05] complexity because when somebody's done
[56:07] something wrong to us or we've done
[56:09] something wrong to somebody and they
[56:10] hate us that's when it's like come on be
[56:12] real I mean David they've all gathered
[56:14] against you because you went into their
[56:16] house and burned their will right like
[56:18] you went and tore down the sun room you
[56:20] built from that this is why they've come
[56:21] back against you you because you
[56:23] escalated the conflict but David said
[56:25] done nothing right yes and so this is
[56:28] one of those moments where hate would be
[56:29] so easy to justify cuz ultimate doesn't
[56:31] really fall back on you and saying I
[56:33] know I started it I know I escalated it
[56:35] they did this they didn't let me borrow
[56:36] the book that's why I denied them the
[56:38] pencil but then they did you but in this
[56:40] situation David can say hey they asked
[56:41] for a book I gave it to them they asked
[56:43] for a pencil I gave it to them I I I let
[56:46] them defraud me this is without cause
[56:48] they've compassed me about with words of
[56:49] hatred fought against me without a cost
[56:50] for my love they are my adversaries and
[56:53] there's the real kernel of Truth there
[56:55] but I give myself into prayer and they
[56:58] have rewarded me evil for good and
[57:01] hatred for my
[57:03] love now David if you can I was going to
[57:07] read all 31 verses of this chapter
[57:09] because man it gets really
[57:10] rich but David now affords us an example
[57:14] for the worst of
[57:16] times because in big ways and small ways
[57:18] we could provoke be provoked to hate but
[57:20] he's given us an example for the worst
[57:22] of times but also for the most normal
[57:25] times the most the smallest of offenses
[57:28] that breed
[57:30] hatred and when David is in this
[57:32] situation I love how he cries out in
[57:34] this because in Psalms 109 if you were
[57:36] to read this he says this he says let
[57:39] his days be few let another take his
[57:41] office let his children be fatherless
[57:42] and his wife a widow let his children be
[57:44] continually vagabonds and beg let them
[57:46] seek their bread also out of their
[57:47] desolate places he's just being honest
[57:49] about how he feels I don't know that any
[57:51] one of us should just kind of knit this
[57:53] into a nice uh Mosaic or whatever a and
[57:57] put it on our wall have it printed out
[57:59] those really nice hipster fonts and put
[58:00] it in our powder bath so everyone in
[58:02] there who's just kind of washing their
[58:04] hands before dinner says let their
[58:05] children be
[58:06] fatherless as some sort of platitude
[58:08] that we should all aspire to but it's
[58:10] just being honest about how these
[58:12] feelings can overwhelm them but in this
[58:14] instance he gives us the right kind of
[58:16] response because where was David's
[58:18] confidence in the end what what was
[58:20] David saying I hearby sharpen my sword
[58:22] that I might cut all the necks of those
[58:24] who have me and hate me unjustly what
[58:26] did he give himself over to in this
[58:28] instance the
[58:29] Lord amen amen the Lord was going to be
[58:33] his help in this time of assault and
[58:34] danger the Lord was going to be his
[58:36] light the Lord was going to be his
[58:38] salvation the Lord was going to be the
[58:40] strength of his life when he saw the
[58:41] wicked even his enemies coming to take
[58:43] his life he didn't trust in his ability
[58:46] to defend his life he trusted in God's
[58:48] ability to sustain life he didn't trust
[58:50] in his ability to fight and respond in
[58:52] kind he said Lord I look to you as my
[58:54] life I look to you as my salvation
[58:56] therefore because I trust in you I do
[58:58] not have to have confidence in my
[59:00] ability to fight or defend myself I can
[59:02] just trust in you he says in this will I
[59:05] be
[59:06] confident in this will I feel safe in
[59:10] this will I trust in this will I be bold
[59:13] and secure that you are my light and my
[59:17] salvation that you are the strength of
[59:19] my
[59:21] life and in light of this confidence
[59:23] watch what no recognize what he seeks he
[59:26] doesn't seek retribution doesn't give in
[59:29] resentment or hatred notice what he
[59:31] begins to seek after and aspire to one
[59:33] thing have I desired verse four of the
[59:35] Lord that I will seek after not
[59:37] Vengeance not wrath not
[59:39] judgment not even all those things he
[59:42] recites in Psalms 109 but he says that I
[59:45] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[59:47] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[59:50] of the Lord and to inquire in his
[59:53] Temple
[59:56] so
[59:57] much depth to
[1:00:00] this he doesn't desire wrath he doesn't
[1:00:02] desire hatred he's not Desiring
[1:00:04] retribution he comes to a place where he
[1:00:05] recognizes this being a Rapture
[1:00:07] scripture I think it speaks of maturity
[1:00:09] speaks of growth not in our youth always
[1:00:12] lashing out and responding but that real
[1:00:14] seasoning out the the self-control that
[1:00:17] comes as it grows in us one thing have I
[1:00:20] desired and I'll seek after this to
[1:00:21] dwell in the house of the Lord to behold
[1:00:23] the beauty of the Lord you want to
[1:00:25] behold the beauty of Christ he's hanging
[1:00:27] on a cross he's been unjustly accused of
[1:00:32] crimes he's been unjustly accused of
[1:00:34] blasphemy he's been unjustly scourged
[1:00:37] he's been traded for a murderer he's
[1:00:39] been beaten and nailed to a cross and
[1:00:41] here he is hanging on the cross unjustly
[1:00:44] he cries out father forgive them for
[1:00:46] they know not what they do he could have
[1:00:49] he could have acted out in hatred and
[1:00:50] Spite and Malice behold the beauty of
[1:00:52] the Lord in a moment when he had been
[1:00:55] undone when he had been unjustly accused
[1:00:57] he said forgive
[1:00:59] him and Paul tells us in Ephesians 4
[1:01:01] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:01:03] whereby you are sealed into the day of
[1:01:04] redemption let all bitterness and wrath
[1:01:07] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[1:01:09] be put away from you with all
[1:01:11] malice let it be put away let it not
[1:01:13] have place in your heart Jesus doesn't
[1:01:15] lash out he doesn't revile back he
[1:01:17] doesn't speak Angry Words even when the
[1:01:19] thief on the cross was accusing him and
[1:01:21] beray and belittle him in that moment he
[1:01:23] didn't give in to the he just spoke
[1:01:25] kindness to the one who had empathy and
[1:01:27] who had sorrow father forgive me I I'm
[1:01:30] the one that deserves to be here I've
[1:01:32] sinned Jesus forgive me he says this day
[1:01:34] you'll be with me in Paradise this is
[1:01:36] what we ought to Aspire to to put away
[1:01:38] anger wrath and bitterness clam and evil
[1:01:41] speaking and this malice all which has
[1:01:43] some connection and connectivity to
[1:01:46] hatred and be kind to one another
[1:01:49] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:01:51] as God for Christ's sakes hath forgiven
[1:01:56] you when I'm talking about where's the
[1:01:59] confidence I'm challenging us to
[1:02:01] recognize what hate motivates us to do
[1:02:03] versus what love will motivate us to do
[1:02:05] and how that hate kind of gives us the
[1:02:07] badge of authority and anoints us to be
[1:02:10] the Avenger and we act upon our own
[1:02:12] instincts and responses putting
[1:02:14] confidence in our wrath and anger rather
[1:02:17] than
[1:02:19] God and hate wants to use
[1:02:22] Force hate wants to use evil speaking
[1:02:24] and bitterness and wrath and clamor and
[1:02:26] all these things fa hate wants to use
[1:02:28] Force but love will use
[1:02:31] wisdom and that's the real secret to
[1:02:33] overcoming offenses and differences Even
[1:02:36] in our interactions with one another
[1:02:38] whether it be spouses or with our
[1:02:39] children when we can have the the
[1:02:41] understanding I don't want to use Force
[1:02:42] hate will use Force whereas wisdom will
[1:02:45] use other
[1:02:47] means brother brandom in that sermon
[1:02:49] from that time he says we got the wrong
[1:02:51] con conception of power this is one I
[1:02:54] was in intending to use on Sunday says
[1:02:55] power is overcoming returning good for
[1:02:58] evil that's real
[1:03:01] power in in those terms many times when
[1:03:04] we respond to the offender with a
[1:03:06] similar offense we're kind of boasting
[1:03:08] that we're stronger oh you think that's
[1:03:10] a cut down listen to this one you think
[1:03:12] that was a good lie I've got a better
[1:03:14] one you think that was a good punch I've
[1:03:15] got a better punch but he's saying
[1:03:17] that's not power returning good for evil
[1:03:19] that's real power that can love your
[1:03:22] enemy and do good to those that do evil
[1:03:24] to you that's real power that's God's
[1:03:27] power want to show them how much
[1:03:29] strength you have don't you don't need
[1:03:31] to match wits you don't need to match
[1:03:33] conspiracies and and being con con
[1:03:36] conniving kids were listening to
[1:03:38] something where these hedgehogs are
[1:03:40] being accused of being connivers they
[1:03:42] said we're not connivers we're we're
[1:03:44] we're plant
[1:03:45] eaters I think they a little bit of a
[1:03:48] misunderstanding of what a conniver
[1:03:51] is and this he says that you could when
[1:03:53] you can love your enemy and do good to
[1:03:55] those that do evil to you that's real
[1:03:56] power that's God power he says Maniacs
[1:03:58] can break
[1:03:59] chains but it takes a real man to return
[1:04:02] good for evil from his heart not because
[1:04:05] of religious duty but from his heart
[1:04:08] that's what we want to come to the place
[1:04:10] where in our hearts we truly not in that
[1:04:12] moment where it's like there's just a
[1:04:13] boiling rage it's like well I don't want
[1:04:15] to act like a hypocrite and I don't want
[1:04:16] to do something to show everybody I got
[1:04:18] the worst temper so I'm going to pretend
[1:04:20] to handle this right and you're still
[1:04:21] boiling really come to a place where yes
[1:04:24] that temperature May begin to rise but
[1:04:26] as it Force you're going to resort to
[1:04:27] this this wisdom from above you're say
[1:04:30] no no no no no no no I don't want to
[1:04:31] return this Amen in Colossians 31213 and
[1:04:35] 14 put on therefore as the elect of God
[1:04:37] holy and beloved bows of mercies
[1:04:40] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:04:43] longsuffering these characteristics that
[1:04:45] are the opposite of hatred forbearing
[1:04:48] one another and forgiving one another If
[1:04:50] any man have a quarrel against any even
[1:04:53] as Christ forgave you so also do ye he
[1:04:56] does not condemn you for quarreling he
[1:04:58] does not condemn you for having a he
[1:05:00] just now those with the quarrel those
[1:05:02] with the disagreement those with thought
[1:05:03] just
[1:05:04] forgive leave it let it go and above all
[1:05:07] these things put on charity which is the
[1:05:09] bond of
[1:05:10] perfectness hatred will undo the
[1:05:12] perfectness the perfectness but charity
[1:05:15] bonds it together 1 Peter 4: 8 and9 and
[1:05:20] above all things have fervent charity
[1:05:22] among yourselves for it shall cover the
[1:05:25] multitude of
[1:05:27] sins use hospit Hospitality one to
[1:05:30] another without
[1:05:32] grudging give
[1:05:34] loan right Grudge not don't hold the
[1:05:37] grudge don't bear The Grudge I think
[1:05:39] this is maybe what it takes if I could
[1:05:40] give some hope to those if this still
[1:05:42] seems to be heavy it's putting the power
[1:05:44] in your hand to diffuse a situation
[1:05:46] that's been roiling for a long time that
[1:05:48] I could break the cycle of tit
[1:05:50] fortat spy versus spy prank versus prank
[1:05:53] I could break the cycle Now by giving
[1:05:56] Hospitality by love covering by not
[1:06:00] grudging and not serving grudgingly use
[1:06:03] Hospitality without
[1:06:06] grudging know there there a way that you
[1:06:08] could do something for somebody right
[1:06:11] because I have to I guess I won't punch
[1:06:14] you I guess I won't do this and it it
[1:06:18] exudes The Grudge and it keeps the cycle
[1:06:22] going yes but David is saying in this
[1:06:25] will I be
[1:06:27] confident I'm not going to put myself
[1:06:29] confidence in schemes and paybacks and a
[1:06:31] one uping things I'm not going to do it
[1:06:33] he says for in the time of trouble
[1:06:35] Psalms 275 and6 Brothers you could come
[1:06:37] to your instruments for in the time of
[1:06:39] trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:06:42] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:06:44] shall he hide me he shall set me up upon
[1:06:48] a
[1:06:48] rock he shall do
[1:06:51] it in this will I be confident the Lord
[1:06:53] has is my light and my salvation the
[1:06:55] Lord of God is the strength of my life
[1:06:57] that is what I'm confident in and
[1:07:00] because I'm confident in him in the
[1:07:02] existence of this trouble in this time
[1:07:04] of trouble he's going to hide me in his
[1:07:06] Pavilion in the secret of his time he
[1:07:08] shall hide me he shall set me up upon a
[1:07:10] rock I will not fear what man can do
[1:07:12] unto me the lies the rumors the
[1:07:15] disputings all these things that are
[1:07:16] happening they Compass me with words of
[1:07:18] hatred they're grudging against me
[1:07:19] without cause they've rewarded me evil
[1:07:21] for good I don't have to reward evil for
[1:07:24] evil I can still give back good why
[1:07:27] because the Lord is going to set me up
[1:07:28] upon a rock the Lord is going to look
[1:07:30] out after me this is why David can say
[1:07:32] the battle is the
[1:07:34] Lord's God said vengeance is mine sayith
[1:07:37] the Lord I'll trust in him and not
[1:07:40] myself the judge is at the door I'll
[1:07:43] Trust the
[1:07:45] judge I just got this picture in my
[1:07:48] mind of you being in a situation and
[1:07:52] there's an offense
[1:07:55] and you start getting worked
[1:07:57] up and in maybe some symbolic way or
[1:08:00] some analogy you begin to kind of ball
[1:08:02] your fist up you get to purse your lips
[1:08:04] and you find yourself getting ready to
[1:08:07] respond and you're getting ready to
[1:08:09] attack them and just over the shoulder
[1:08:11] of your adversary you see the Lord
[1:08:13] standing at the door amen and as you see
[1:08:16] him you
[1:08:18] realize no I don't need to worry about
[1:08:22] this not because you're afraid of let
[1:08:24] letting down the Lord not because you
[1:08:25] you're going to disappoint not because
[1:08:27] of some religious Duty not because you
[1:08:28] want to be you're afraid of being
[1:08:29] condemned thought we could travel that
[1:08:31] path but in that moment you
[1:08:33] realize with God before me who can be
[1:08:36] against me with the judge in his
[1:08:40] presence in a time of trouble
[1:08:43] he when the Lord himself has descended
[1:08:45] with a shout when I find myself in his
[1:08:49] presence why should I be worried about
[1:08:51] all these barking squirrels why should I
[1:08:53] be worried about all these chattering
[1:08:55] Chipmunks why should I be worried about
[1:08:57] all these scoffers and mockers in the
[1:08:59] last last day the judge is here I trust
[1:09:03] in
[1:09:04] him and he's hid me in the secret of his
[1:09:08] presence and he set me up upon a rock
[1:09:11] and then this this phrase in here in
[1:09:13] verse six and now shall my head be
[1:09:17] lifted up above mine enemies round about
[1:09:20] me therefore will I offer in his
[1:09:24] Tabernacle sacrifices the joy I will
[1:09:26] sing y I will sing praises unto the Lord
[1:09:28] notice what's not in his mouth cursings
[1:09:30] disputings revilings fighting back
[1:09:32] arguing there's not hatred there's just
[1:09:34] praise for the Lord the judge is at the
[1:09:37] door let's reverence him he's here let's
[1:09:39] worship him but this phrase now shall my
[1:09:44] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[1:09:46] round about me it struck me this way
[1:09:48] over these last few weeks now I will not
[1:09:51] allow my
[1:09:52] soul to be
[1:09:55] degraded by
[1:09:57] hatred I will live above the hate am the
[1:10:02] hatred is trying to bring me low the
[1:10:04] hatred is trying to narrow and debase me
[1:10:06] the hatred is trying to degrade me the
[1:10:07] narrow this this hatred is trying to get
[1:10:09] me to be Earthly and uh sensual and
[1:10:12] devilish the the devil's trying to get
[1:10:14] me to respond carnally the devil's W me
[1:10:16] to avenge myself draw my sword fight
[1:10:18] back the devil these things the enemies
[1:10:20] wanted me to hate so they can be
[1:10:21] justified in their hatred they're wanted
[1:10:23] me to deprive they're wanting me to
[1:10:25] Grudge he says now now because the judge
[1:10:28] I've recognized him now I'll be lifted
[1:10:31] above it I can live above the hate now
[1:10:34] my head will be lifted above it why
[1:10:36] could he do it because he trusted in the
[1:10:39] Lord and when we trust in the
[1:10:42] Lord we can be
[1:10:44] confident but we abandon our confidence
[1:10:46] when we yield to
[1:10:48] hate now you you you have confidence but
[1:10:50] in
[1:10:51] yourself it's the same thing for a peace
[1:10:53] and our strength right and love and our
[1:10:58] our confidence that there's something we
[1:11:00] can get our strength from there's
[1:11:01] something we can find love in there's
[1:11:03] something that we can find peace in
[1:11:05] there's someone we can confide in and
[1:11:06] have confidence and Trust in but it's
[1:11:08] when we lose sight of that that we give
[1:11:09] into
[1:11:11] hate brother BR makes this statement of
[1:11:13] sermon thirsting for life he says the
[1:11:14] pleasure of a Christian is serving the
[1:11:16] lord at the house of God one thing have
[1:11:19] I desired that will I seek after you
[1:11:22] don't have to sign no card you can't
[1:11:23] open the door quick enough and if the
[1:11:26] members of the church love one another
[1:11:28] enough instead of putting the little
[1:11:29] clicks and pulling away from the church
[1:11:32] brother if you love one another so much
[1:11:33] that it just hurts your heart till you
[1:11:35] got together you just got together again
[1:11:38] that's the way it should
[1:11:40] be because it's that something that's
[1:11:42] inviting and welcoming talk about the
[1:11:44] house of the Lord and I I'm sharing this
[1:11:47] to talk to identify confidence and even
[1:11:50] go back to where's the strength cuz he
[1:11:52] begins to sing blessed to be the tithe
[1:11:54] that binds our hearts in Christian Love
[1:11:56] The Fellowship of Kindred mind is like
[1:11:58] to that above when we are sunnd part it
[1:12:00] gives us inward pain but we sh still
[1:12:02] shall be joined in heart in hope to meet
[1:12:05] again hatred destroys Fellowship breeds
[1:12:09] bitterness he
[1:12:11] says he says oh God if we have to take
[1:12:14] every Miracle out of the
[1:12:17] church if we have to take out all the
[1:12:20] pipe organs and the plush pews give us
[1:12:23] back to that Godly love Brotherly Love
[1:12:25] among the people in fellowship if we
[1:12:27] have to do all that take it back to that
[1:12:31] again now that should be
[1:12:34] emphasized say what good is all of our
[1:12:38] Miracles all of our worship and music
[1:12:41] and syncopation and vocalization and all
[1:12:44] the plush pews and all the gingerbread
[1:12:46] to our new churches what good is all
[1:12:48] those things if we don't have Godly love
[1:12:51] brotherly love if we don't have unity
[1:12:52] and fellowship ship and what good is it
[1:12:54] to have all that power and still hate
[1:12:56] your neighbor what good is it to have
[1:12:58] all that and still clamor and be evil
[1:13:00] and be bitter and be jealous and lash
[1:13:02] out and Destroy and defraud and lie and
[1:13:04] manipulate and confuse what good is all
[1:13:06] that fantastic and all that pie in the
[1:13:09] sky and not have the love of God in your
[1:13:11] heart he said oh God take away the
[1:13:13] Miracles take away the music take away
[1:13:16] the pews if that's what it takes to get
[1:13:18] love in our hearts and hate out he says
[1:13:21] do it
[1:13:24] because that's where the real confidence
[1:13:25] is that's where the real power is take
[1:13:29] out the Miracles take out the worship
[1:13:30] take out the
[1:13:32] music take out the
[1:13:34] hate cuz what good is all that with
[1:13:37] hate I'd rather have no Miracles no pipe
[1:13:41] organs no plush
[1:13:43] pews I think the only thing we'd have to
[1:13:45] worry about is miracles in this
[1:13:47] church don't have a pipe organ don't
[1:13:51] have
[1:13:52] pews
[1:13:54] but to say go ahead take out the
[1:13:56] Miracles because we've seen miracles in
[1:13:57] this church a lot of
[1:14:00] them but we should have the kind of
[1:14:02] heart to say Lord if there's if there's
[1:14:04] hate that's Brewing if hate has place
[1:14:07] and what it takes is for you to take out
[1:14:09] the Miracles in order to get rid of the
[1:14:10] hate we should be willing to say yes
[1:14:13] Lord and not use Miracles and signs and
[1:14:17] wonders and bodily exercise and the
[1:14:20] operation of the gifts as a cover
[1:14:24] hate let's Stand
[1:14:26] Together
