[0:00] tonight I want to uh use for a
[0:04] subject fundamental people with
[0:08] Pentecostal Faith fundamental people
[0:11] with Pentecostal faith and I kind of
[0:16] changed it around from How The Prophet
[0:18] said it but I want to read to you what
[0:21] he said you know uh in in in the message
[0:25] he says how much faith can you use he
[0:29] say the trouble of it is that I found I
[0:32] said the other night two different
[0:35] classes of people amen two different
[0:38] classes of people now he's talking about
[0:39] in this journey of preaching and going
[0:42] to different churches now I I I don't
[0:45] necessarily want to talk about by the
[0:47] grace of God where we say there's three
[0:50] kinds of Believers amen or three kinds
[0:53] of people in the church there's a a
[0:56] Believer a make believer amen and
[0:59] there's are regular unbeliever but the
[1:02] prophet was talking about in his journey
[1:04] of the church and what he sees people
[1:07] trying to serve God and he said I see
[1:10] two different classes of people one of
[1:13] them is fundamental positionally they
[1:16] know what they are the next is
[1:20] Pentecostals the fundament
[1:22] fundamentalist and the Pentecostals the
[1:24] Pentecostals have faith the
[1:26] fundamentalist has the position of Truth
[1:29] amen so the question we ask is what
[1:32] category do you fit in amen because he
[1:35] said there's two kinds of people one is
[1:38] the fundamental believer amen what is a
[1:41] fundamental believer that's somebody who
[1:43] knows the law Hallelujah they know the
[1:47] law they know everything the prophet
[1:48] preach they can quote it they can quote
[1:50] it left and right but it's it's it's
[1:53] it's it's not alive to that person you
[1:56] know it's per se it's just a bunch of
[1:59] Dos and don't you know I'm going to do
[2:01] this because the prophet said so I'm not
[2:03] going to do this because the prophet
[2:05] said so and you know that won't get you
[2:07] no way in Christ Hallelujah because
[2:10] eventually amen you may have a bad day
[2:13] and you just might not feel like doing
[2:16] it hallelujah how many of us been saved
[2:19] a while and and sometimes you have days
[2:22] where you just don't feel good about
[2:24] Hallelujah
[2:26] Christianity you know but a fundamental
[2:28] believer Hallelujah
[2:30] they can serve god with no feeling in
[2:33] it they can do everything they can dress
[2:36] right they can look right they can pay
[2:38] TI they can do all these things with no
[2:41] feeling in it Hallelujah but the prophet
[2:43] of God said amen that that's the kind of
[2:46] people that are in the church
[2:47] fundamental Hallelujah with fundamental
[2:50] people hallelujah but there's a people
[2:53] also in the church Hallelujah that have
[2:56] Pentecostal Faith amen and what do you
[2:58] mean brother J by across the faith
[3:01] Hallelujah somebody in the church
[3:03] Hallelujah that can believe what God did
[3:06] in the book of Acts hallelujah oh let's
[3:08] just go back to the prophet like like uh
[3:11] uh the the the fundamentals they'll look
[3:14] at the message of the hour and all they
[3:16] want is
[3:18] Miracles give me a vision Give Me A Sign
[3:22] give me this give me that Hallelujah and
[3:24] once they get that they go back to their
[3:26] own R in life right
[3:29] y'all know me I'm just brother DS
[3:31] hallelujah hallelujah and you know
[3:34] church he said these are the two kinds
[3:36] of people I see he said but look he says
[3:40] now but the fundamentalist doesn't have
[3:43] any faith to operate hallelujah what
[3:46] they believe oh my think about that
[3:49] church there are people who believe what
[3:52] you believe but they ain't got no faith
[3:55] to make it live right that's a sad place
[3:58] to be in for to come and vindicate his
[4:01] word and do such a powerful out show of
[4:04] his grace and all we can do is quote
[4:07] what the prophet said all we can do is
[4:09] go back to what God did in his life it
[4:12] has to be more than
[4:15] that
[4:17] Hallelujah don't want to hold you too
[4:19] long Hallelujah it has to be more than
[4:22] just us conquering up things that we'
[4:26] seen in a prophet's life Hallelujah but
[4:28] it has to be real unto the individual
[4:31] Hallelujah Church the prophet of God
[4:33] said he said in one place the reason why
[4:36] they walked the 70 walked away from
[4:39] Jesus was because they didn't see
[4:42] themselves as a part of the
[4:44] [Music]
[4:46] ministry oh my you know I've been lately
[4:52] I've been um preaching and you know we
[4:55] believe we got truth right amen and we
[4:57] didn't had Truth for years and you know
[5:00] it kind of baffles me a little bit just
[5:02] to get up and preach and you preach the
[5:04] word of God and people stare at you it's
[5:08] it's it's you know it's just the time we
[5:11] in you know I used to just preach
[5:13] through it and and Hammer demons but
[5:15] Church we're further alone we should be
[5:19] able to to agree with the word
[5:21] hallelujah amen God is not in a nodding
[5:26] business so by the grace of God you're
[5:28] going to see I've been I've lately this
[5:31] is what I've been doing I've been
[5:32] preaching but I've been helping you help
[5:35] [Laughter]
[5:37] me is God good amen I said is God good
[5:42] amen has he been good to you am is God a
[5:46] Healer is God a savior is he an ontime
[5:51] God
[5:53] Amen praise so you can say Amen praise
[5:57] the Lord hallelujah but you know church
[5:59] when we look Hallelujah when we look at
[6:01] the goodness of God how many of us
[6:04] appreciate what he's done for us
[6:07] hallelujah he said look he said the
[6:10] Pentecostals he said he said the
[6:11] fundamentalist Hallelujah doesn't have
[6:14] any faith to operate what they believe
[6:17] who does that sound like that sounds
[6:19] like the Sadducees and
[6:22] Pharisees because
[6:25] fundamentally they knew the
[6:27] word fundamentally they dress right they
[6:30] look right you couldn't put a a a finger
[6:33] on their lives but when Jesus
[6:37] came they couldn't Hallelujah identify
[6:41] the word they couldn't identify let me
[6:43] say it like this the operation of the
[6:46] word hallelujah because they knew the
[6:48] word but they couldn't believe it could
[6:51] operate in flesh like
[6:54] that wa oh my church that's what's been
[6:58] restored unto us the operation of the
[7:02] word in flesh we not only got truth but
[7:06] we got
[7:09] Vindication I'm kind of I hope you see
[7:12] what I'm doing by the grace of God I'm
[7:15] showing you that in our day those two
[7:19] should come to a
[7:22] blending Hallelujah we are fundamental
[7:25] people who will live by thus say the
[7:28] Lord who will live right who will obey
[7:31] the scriptures but what good is that if
[7:34] we don't have no
[7:36] Vindication we just Sadducees and
[7:38] Pharisees cuz you look Church you look
[7:40] through the Bible when Jesus came the
[7:43] Sadducees and Pharisees who knew the
[7:46] word they doubted him why because he
[7:49] came so simple H he came so simple and
[7:54] he found himself he found Hallelujah
[7:56] where did Jesus Find Faith he found
[7:59] faith in the lives of people that were
[8:01] hurting W he found faith in the lives of
[8:05] people who were in need hallelujah how
[8:07] you said he said Hallelujah he came to a
[8:10] people who had a need not to a people
[8:12] who had everything together Hallelujah
[8:15] and you know the fundamentals they feel
[8:17] like they got everything together you
[8:20] know what and they'll put they Fang on
[8:22] your life they'll say well he did this
[8:24] and this wrong and this happened in his
[8:26] family this with his children all this
[8:29] stuff fundamental fundamental
[8:30] fundamental not even realizing that God
[8:32] put you in
[8:34] that
[8:35] W God put you in that why to bring you
[8:38] closer amen hallelujah I don't want to
[8:41] be a fundamental person just watching
[8:44] everything around me with no
[8:47] faith that's right because what the
[8:49] Sadducees were doing they were putting
[8:51] their finger on everything that was
[8:53] wrong when the grace was right before
[8:56] them they told Jesus in one place if if
[8:59] he knew what kind of woman that was was
[9:01] touching him he wouldn't let it do it
[9:03] but let me tell you something about
[9:04] Jesus you couldn't touch him if he
[9:06] didn't want you
[9:07] to Hallelujah you couldn't get close to
[9:11] him if he didn't want you to cuz
[9:13] remember church when they first came to
[9:15] get him Hallelujah Jesus said okay let
[9:17] me show you something I want to show
[9:19] y'all something he said nobody take my
[9:21] life but I lay it down Hallelujah nobody
[9:26] take my life I lay it down there's where
[9:29] the blessing is for us we lay our lives
[9:32] down to follow Christ we lay our lives
[9:35] down Hallelujah to be the message of the
[9:38] hour which is not a Book and
[9:42] Tape W
[9:45] Hallelujah let me help you out one more
[9:48] time amen
[9:51] hallelujah oh my church I love talking
[9:53] about true true
[9:56] manifestation and you know when the
[9:58] prophet preach message is like the
[10:00] Mighty God unveiled Hall where was he
[10:02] being
[10:04] unveiled
[10:06] Hallelujah we say yeah it was the word
[10:09] but where was the word or should I say
[10:12] who was the word hallelujah where was he
[10:15] being unveil he was being unveiled for
[10:17] one in a Vindicated prophet and a
[10:20] Vindicated Prophet was who he come to a
[10:22] Vindicated
[10:24] people hallelujah so while he was being
[10:28] unveiled in that prophet he was also
[10:30] being unveiled in those people
[10:33] hallelujah but if you're fundamental you
[10:36] miss it and say that's just a white man
[10:37] from Kentucky who can't talk right can't
[10:40] speak right his clothes don't look right
[10:42] and all the stuff and blah blah blah
[10:44] blah blah blah
[10:46] fundamental and you put your finger on
[10:48] all this mistakes Hallelujah you know
[10:50] where that comes from hallelujah it's
[10:53] the same life that was there in the
[10:55] moabites Hallelujah when you go back and
[10:57] read the Bible the mo ites had
[11:00] everything Israel
[11:04] had oh we got some Bible readers in
[11:07] here hallelujah cuz we know Hallelujah
[11:10] the message made our Bible Hallelujah
[11:15] illuminate Hallelujah without the
[11:17] message Hallelujah you're no more than a
[11:20] Baptist you're more no more than just a
[11:23] ordinary Pentecostal by denomination
[11:25] you're no more than just a Catholic
[11:27] Hallelujah but God came brought us a
[11:30] word hallelujah that opened the book
[11:32] Hallelujah opened the book where we
[11:34] could understand it it illuminated it
[11:37] and it brought us out of
[11:40] fundamentalism
[11:42] Hallelujah W Hallelujah church as we
[11:45] look and we see how God did what he did
[11:48] let's keep going he says the
[11:51] Pentecostals Hallelujah has it he's
[11:53] talking about faith Hallelujah he said
[11:55] it has it but don't know who they are
[11:59] What a Sad place to be in you got faith
[12:03] but you don't know who you are he say
[12:05] it's like a person who
[12:07] got can got money in the bank but can't
[12:10] write a check and then he said there's
[12:12] another one Hallelujah vice versa
[12:14] Hallelujah got the check but ain't got
[12:16] no money in the bank sometimes I feel
[12:19] like I'm in that
[12:22] category hallelujah oh my but then God
[12:26] always comes a to to to to to vindicate
[12:29] no you're my
[12:31] servant just speak the word
[12:35] only Hallelujah Glory but look church he
[12:38] says he said that's it and look it's
[12:42] just like man who has a lot of money in
[12:44] the bank but he can't write a check the
[12:47] other man can write a check and ain't
[12:50] got no money in the bank if Listen
[12:52] thisen Now Catch Us catch us now you
[12:55] think about how long the prophet's been
[12:57] gone and how long we've been preaching
[12:59] hallu the Vindicated word oh let me say
[13:02] it like this how long Jesus been gone
[13:04] for the Earth and how long we've been
[13:06] preaching Jesus
[13:09] Christ Hallelujah
[13:13] W think about that Hallelujah there has
[13:16] to be a purpose in our pre in US
[13:18] preaching Christ what is it doing it's
[13:21] getting us ready for his return
[13:24] Hallelujah see we can't fundamentally
[13:28] make a rapture
[13:30] because there's nothing you can do to
[13:32] make
[13:34] it if that's the case it'll be on a book
[13:37] with some instructions and all of us
[13:39] will do those instructions and we'll
[13:40] just wait as soon as that time
[13:43] comes but God didn't do it like that H
[13:46] there has to be what a Measure of Faith
[13:48] to make the Rapture Hallelujah yeah you
[13:50] got to live right but you also got to
[13:52] have faith while you living right but he
[13:54] said Hallelujah you got one that can
[13:56] write the check ain't got no money he
[13:58] said other one got money but can't right
[14:00] the check and now he says hallelujah he
[14:03] says if I could get Hallelujah he said
[14:06] if I could ever get them together he
[14:10] said brother the Millennium would
[14:15] start so there are people in the church
[14:18] who don't know who they are and y'all
[14:21] holding us
[14:26] up don't get mad at me the prophet said
[14:28] it
[14:31] he said if I could ever get those two
[14:33] together the Millennium would start and
[14:38] we know that Millennium is that three
[14:39] and a half years of rain Hallelujah
[14:41] before we get to Millennium there has to
[14:43] be a Rapture take place right Hallelujah
[14:45] so he says he says if I could ever get
[14:47] those together the Rapture would have
[14:49] taken place already oh my so what's
[14:53] holding up God H you got fundamental
[14:56] people hallelujah
[14:59] with no faith and then you got
[15:01] Pentecostal people with faith but don't
[15:04] know who they are and then he says if I
[15:06] can ever get those two together
[15:08] Hallelujah the Millennium would take
[15:10] place it would start amen church I don't
[15:12] know about you but I believe this gospel
[15:16] I believe the truth of the word I
[15:18] believe you got to be Sanctified
[15:20] Hallelujah I believe in
[15:23] Holiness Hallelujah let's understand
[15:25] something I think what we've done amen
[15:28] we we we we hit the stage of
[15:30] justification and we made sanctification
[15:33] what's on the
[15:37] outside it ain't how you
[15:41] look Hallelujah cuz remember
[15:44] justification says you never did it in
[15:46] the first place so I can look crazy but
[15:49] according to God God saying I ain't
[15:52] crazy never did it in the first place
[15:54] that's why Hallelujah most of us I
[15:57] shouldn't say most of us but those of us
[15:59] who wen't born in us hallelujah we had
[16:02] to be Hallelujah introduced to it find
[16:05] out what repentance is repent Hallelujah
[16:08] and then grow in Christ
[16:11] Hallelujah forgetting about that days of
[16:14] old and being able to live in the now
[16:17] saying God I thank you for your grace
[16:20] amen but you know what the fundamental
[16:22] does the fundamental like that brings up
[16:24] your
[16:27] past even in this day when we have so
[16:30] much truth and people filled with the
[16:32] Holy Ghost you'll see somebody do wrong
[16:34] and you'll condemn
[16:36] them remember I said people with the
[16:39] Holy
[16:40] Ghost people with the Holy Ghost can do
[16:45] wrong you don't like that one do
[16:48] you it's
[16:51] true because he said you don't begin to
[16:54] fight until you get the Holy Ghost
[16:57] Hallelujah with the Holy Ghost you do we
[17:00] did stuff and it didn't even bother us
[17:02] but with the Holy Ghost we go back and
[17:04] say Lord I didn't mean to do that we
[17:06] have we we we learn Hallelujah we
[17:09] operate in Repentance Hallelujah
[17:11] repentance is not you just confessing it
[17:14] out of your mouth repentance is
[17:16] confessing and
[17:18] forsaking Hallelujah but what we've done
[17:22] we we we accept the justification but
[17:24] when it comes to be Sanctified we put it
[17:26] on something on the outside
[17:29] no sanctification deals with the inward
[17:31] Man
[17:32] Too
[17:34] W Hallelujah the problem of God said
[17:38] sanctification is when God takes the
[17:40] want to
[17:42] away thank you Lord
[17:45] hallelujah how many of us have been
[17:47] there or should be there Hallelujah cuz
[17:51] I used to do some stuff but I ain't
[17:52] going to tell y'all I used to do some
[17:54] stuff I wasn't proud of Hallelujah but
[17:57] then God came and he began to clean me
[17:59] up as he cleaned me up what happened I
[18:03] lost my desire to do what I used to do
[18:06] and as I lost my desire what happened I
[18:09] began to become
[18:13] fundamental Hallelujah I would just do
[18:15] what was right why because I didn't have
[18:17] a desire anymore so I would just do what
[18:19] was right I I look in the word and God
[18:21] would say you know all of us come
[18:24] through a stage where when God was
[18:26] cleaning us up we could see wrong in
[18:28] everybody else
[18:31] life you may as well
[18:37] say I don't know about y'all but when
[18:39] God was dealing with me everybody in my
[18:42] family was
[18:44] wrong
[18:46] everybody and I was like John the
[18:48] Baptist Hallelujah I was a tree chopping
[18:52] Hallelujah human
[18:55] being gun slanging word tasseling
[19:02] individual and you know because I was
[19:07] fundamental I wanted to see people live
[19:10] right I wanted because I had conviction
[19:13] amen when you become fundamental you
[19:15] have conviction there's nothing wrong
[19:17] with being fundamental but fundamental
[19:20] can only take you but so far the prophet
[19:22] of God say if fundamental is all he want
[19:25] Cain was right
[19:33] wow oh my if all he want is fundamental
[19:37] Esau was better than
[19:43] Jacob wow because the prophet of God
[19:46] said look like Esau was the better man
[19:49] but he didn't have no
[19:52] conviction Oh my he didn't have no
[19:54] hunger for more than just doing right
[19:58] see Jacob had Hunger for More Than what
[20:00] his eyes could
[20:02] see wow Hallelujah he wanted more of God
[20:06] hallelujah and you know what him want
[20:08] more God made the fundamentalistic
[20:11] believer see more error in his
[20:17] life be careful if you always see an
[20:19] error in people life the trials and
[20:22] stuff you know the hardest thing for us
[20:23] to
[20:24] do y'all might not want me to say this
[20:27] but I'mma say what's your name Christian
[20:29] Christian I like that name Buddy the
[20:32] hardest thing for us to do is be a
[20:35] Christian that was right on time praise
[20:37] God
[20:39] H all it thing for us to do is be a
[20:42] Christian and mind our own
[20:48] business hey how an evangelist I can
[20:52] talk like this Hallelujah I'm not
[20:55] connected to your feelings and and your
[20:57] facial expr imprs and all these things
[20:59] you may be giving me right now cuz you
[21:01] know what I'm going to preach we going
[21:03] have a good time when I leave I'm a high
[21:05] five brother Mike amen and say brother
[21:07] it was good to see you shake brother
[21:09] John's hand and say man I sure
[21:10] appreciate you call brother Aaron and
[21:12] say church was
[21:14] good see you next time while you sitting
[21:17] there mad at
[21:20] truth that's just being
[21:23] fundamental because you fundamental you
[21:26] hear truth and still have resentment in
[21:28] your
[21:30] heart because the sagues Jesus came with
[21:33] truth and nothing but the truth but the
[21:36] Bible says they were offended at
[21:41] him you think
[21:43] about how many denominations were
[21:46] offended at brother
[21:47] Brandon you think about right now how
[21:50] many people are offended at
[21:54] us because we won't go to their parties
[21:56] and when they have cookouts you you you
[21:59] drank
[22:02] juice I hope you
[22:06] do
[22:08] Hallelujah Church be
[22:11] careful because if you all you if if all
[22:14] you are is a fundamental believer the
[22:17] prophet of God said that's a person he
[22:19] said the worst kind of person is a
[22:22] person who got just enough Christianity
[22:24] to make him
[22:27] sick why we we can't do this why we
[22:30] can't do that I want to go here and I go
[22:32] to that that sound like an unconverted
[22:36] teenager you know what I always tell
[22:38] people I be going through play I be in
[22:39] the airport and children be running
[22:41] through the
[22:43] air they look like they out of control
[22:45] they just be running away they be like
[22:47] honey come back over
[22:52] here my mama would like that we were
[22:55] like soldiers
[22:59] because she was like
[23:02] sorrow but you know what what I do to
[23:05] people hallelujah because I've grown in
[23:07] love and grace Hallelujah you know what
[23:09] I when I see people you know the kids be
[23:11] you know certain certain things they do
[23:14] now get me wrong now the Bible say spare
[23:17] the rod spoil the
[23:20] child oh you don't like that one huh
[23:24] [Applause]
[23:28] ain't no psychology in the Bible put
[23:30] them in timeout 1 2 three no cut day
[23:34] behind that what the scripture
[23:39] say not you you a
[23:44] Christian Hallelujah but Church you know
[23:46] what I do Hallelujah now to each his own

[24:23] whenever you ask them to do something
[24:25] they were used to just do it
[24:29] because they believed whatever you
[24:31] said but as they grow and as they get
[24:33] older there's a little word they develop

[32:22] cuz look church let me let me tell you
[32:25] testimony everybody all right amen let
[32:27] me tell you
[32:28] testimony you know I might have told a
[32:30] testimony about God healed me from from
[32:33] brain cancer
[32:35] amen God healed me from brain cancer
[32:38] when I was a young and 15 years
[32:40] old and you know
[32:43] fundamentally I was just trusting in
[32:46] what the word of God says hallelujah and
[32:48] what my mama was saying hallelujah I
[32:50] didn't really have any experience with
[32:52] God but then hallelujah as I let that
[32:56] come out of my mouth there's a certain
[32:57] Lev devil trust trusting God where it
[33:00] became
[33:01] material Hallelujah so much so to I
[33:05] could grow in that Grace for every
[33:07] sickness that will come my
[33:10] way that's what it means to go from just
[33:13] being fundamental to being fundamental
[33:16] Hallelujah with Pentecostal Faith
[33:20] Hallelujah and church fundamentally I
[33:22] said yeah I got Isaiah 53 Hallelujah but
[33:25] Pentecost of faith means Hall when they
[33:27] brought the x-rays to say the cancer is
[33:29] traveling through your body I said no
[33:32] the Bible says I'm healed amen and I'm
[33:35] going to Stand My Ground
[33:38] Hallelujah and trust
[33:40] God hallelujah but you know church that
[33:44] prepared me for other things to come
[33:45] Hallelujah you one time I went to the
[33:47] doctor amen you know because I used to
[33:50] drive trucks by profession before I
[33:52] became a full-time evangelist I used to
[33:54] drive trucks and and and and I had to go
[33:57] God was trying to get me out of the
[33:59] truck that's a long testimony behind it
[34:01] but you know God was trying to get me
[34:03] out of the truck so he pushed me out of
[34:04] the truck and I had to go to the doctor
[34:06] and I say I don't know what's going on
[34:08] with my eyes and this and that they say
[34:09] well you got diabetes I said
[34:13] nope if he healed me from
[34:16] cancer how can I have diabetes that's
[34:20] right either you healed or you're not
[34:22] healed you say brother J that was a
[34:25] different situation still the same God
[34:28] amen still the same word and that's what
[34:31] we have to do fundamentally you'll say
[34:33] oh well this is another trial no
[34:36] Hallelujah another trial but the same
[34:38] Faith amen and you know church he said
[34:41] you got diabetes that blah blah blah I
[34:43] say n no I ain't accepting that H so I
[34:47] just stay with my confession stay with
[34:49] it stay with it and then when they took
[34:52] the test they said NOP you don't have
[34:53] diabetes I said I told
[34:56] you this year some years later I had to
[34:59] uh uh I had to take a a a a driver's
[35:02] test so I went to the nurse or whatever
[35:05] they had went there gave a lady urine
[35:08] sample she said oh my God Mr digs your
[35:14] glucose it's so high I'm like I'mma give
[35:19] I'm I'm going give you some tricks of
[35:20] the
[35:21] devil how many love to know one of his
[35:24] tricks nobody
[35:28] I'm going to give you a trick of the
[35:30] devil this is what he
[35:32] does most of us we'll go to the doctor
[35:37] we be feeling
[35:39] fine and you get in there and they say
[35:42] you got this well why I don't feel like
[35:44] I got
[35:45] it and that's what the devil does he
[35:48] tries he'll pronounce something to get
[35:49] you to accept that spirit so it can
[35:54] live because it cannot live unless you
[35:57] get giving life with your
[36:04] words the problem of God said hallelujah
[36:07] it's just a
[36:09] thought until you give it life then it
[36:12] becomes a
[36:13] spirit Hallelujah so it starts up here
[36:16] first amen you thinking about it or you
[36:19] receiving what the doctor said and once
[36:21] you receive it and it comes out of your
[36:23] mouth then you got it it comes
[36:26] alive this is why the devil don't like
[36:29] me cuz I like to tell his
[36:32] Secrets Hallelujah most people go to the
[36:35] doctor don't even know they got
[36:38] cancer feeling all right they take some
[36:41] say oh my I see a bruise just bruise
[36:43] that the thing you have to do is say
[36:45] well I ain't never saw it so I'm
[36:47] good but once you say okay and you start
[36:51] worrying you get that thing life and
[36:53] then it start developing and it get
[36:55] bigger and bigger why because you spoke
[36:59] it remember the prophet of God said
[37:01] don't accept them them
[37:02] rattlesnakes he said he can come to your
[37:05] house but you got to reject it
[37:07] Hallelujah and that's I tell that's what
[37:09] happened amen that what what does the
[37:12] enemy do he gets us to confess it out of
[37:14] our mouth and once we confess it then it
[37:17] comes alive because Satan ain't got no
[37:20] power unless you give it to
[37:23] us oh we a going we going to let him
[37:25] ride like that now amen Satan ain't got
[37:28] no power unless we give it to him he
[37:32] ain't got no power unless we give it to
[37:35] him
[37:38] amen he needs a
[37:42] vessel but I walked out of there
[37:44] diabetes
[37:47] free but that was just that's just some
[37:50] of my trials where the enemy comes and
[37:52] he wants to try to fight me you know in
[37:55] in in in areas where he think I for
[37:59] got and that's what he does he'll Circle
[38:01] back around thinking you forgot thinking
[38:04] you just fundamental
[38:05] no I
[38:08] believe I believe another time came
[38:11] about with in they talk about the
[38:13] glucose and East Coast and West Coast
[38:16] and fruct toast and light toast and dark
[38:18] toast all kind of toast I lady
[38:24] please nurses get upset with me because
[38:27] I want accept what they telling me and
[38:29] they got their instruments they got all
[38:31] those look I like nurses especially the
[38:33] nice
[38:34] ones you know but if she selling me
[38:37] something she she trying to give me
[38:39] something that I can't find in the
[38:42] word I ain't got to accept
[38:46] it oh Church remember remember when they
[38:50] tell they say in they mind and say we
[38:52] going to throw Jesus off a cliff Jesus
[38:54] walked straight through him that's right
[38:56] why did he do that because there was no
[38:58] scripture saying he should die off a
[39:02] cliff so why accept something about you
[39:05] that's not written in the
[39:07] word why accept something about your
[39:10] family or whatever the case is that's
[39:12] not written in the word hallelujah tell
[39:14] Satan get behind me any sickness any
[39:18] trouble Hallelujah you can't find in the
[39:20] word where God says you have to accept
[39:23] it
[39:24] fight and don't stop fighting fight with
[39:27] what your Pentecost of
[39:29] [Music]
[39:31] faith I went in lady say he got diabetes

[40:57] took came back
[40:59] negative and they wasn't satisfied with
[41:02] letting me have the victory right and
[41:04] that's how the devil will do you
[41:06] Hallelujah you done already spoke your
[41:08] outcome and the enemy will come back and
[41:10] say we going to test you again you stand
[41:12] your ground amen hallelujah stand your
[41:16] ground Hallelujah and I stood my ground
[41:19] Hallelujah he said we're going to take a
[41:21] blood guess I said praise God you going
[41:25] to take a blood test you you going to
[41:27] measure What I Got by the blood I

[41:38] Believer who's under the blood of Jesus
[41:41] Christ you going to test my blood oh my

[41:47] cuz I'm covered by
[41:49] Jesus W Hallelujah test came back
[41:53] negative Hallelujah and you know Church
[41:56] from that first time I had to go from
[41:59] being fundamental to having Pentecostal
[42:01] Faith while I'm keeping my
[42:04] fundamentalism
[42:06] Hallelujah don't get nervous I'm about
[42:08] to
[42:08] close I know some of y'all need that so
[42:11] I'm going say it again I'm about to
[42:13] close you know them words got
[42:16] power wake people up on a Wednesday
[42:21] night listen
[42:28] let's look at the tooth for a
[42:34] second what was the difference than just
[42:37] being
[42:39] fundamental and fundamental with
[42:41] Pentecostal Faith Hallelujah that's
[42:44] where we are as I begin to wrap this up
[42:50] Hallelujah not just a fundamental
[42:52] believer who say well if the prophet
[42:55] said it I believe it no I want it to be
[42:57] revealed to
[42:58] me because if it's revealed to me nobody
[43:01] can take it from me hallelujah it's if
[43:04] if it's revealed to me no matter what
[43:07] the N says dig up in about the message
[43:09] and says not right and all this stuff if
[43:11] it's revealed to me I'm good Hallelujah
[43:15] that's why I tell people people didn't
[43:16] left the message and they argued about
[43:18] the bridge and this thing happening
[43:20] Brother brandom did do and did that you
[43:22] know I tell I say too late too late for
[43:25] me Hall you can say what but you want to
[43:27] say it too late you know why because
[43:29] elar did his part I met
[43:32] Isaac Hallelujah I met Jesus Hallelujah
[43:36] so you can say whatever you want to say
[43:39] about eler I met Jesus eler did his job
[43:43] he took me to Jesus Hallelujah so why
[43:46] would I be reflecting on what they got
[43:48] to say about a dead
[43:52] man I know that was a little too blunt
[43:54] for you
[43:57] hallelujah hallelujah think about the
[44:00] two Hallelujah if you meet Christ it no
[44:03] matter what you what they say by Brother
[44:05] brandom Hallelujah they can say what
[44:06] they want to say if you met
[44:08] Christ Hallelujah because this message
[44:11] was to do what Hallelujah make this word
[44:14] of God
[44:17] live the prophet's whole job what was
[44:20] his job to bring Rebecca to
[44:26] Isaac if you
[44:28] fundamental you still talking to
[44:34] ELA and that ain't
[44:38] scriptural once elea are you with me
[44:41] Church once
[44:43] Ela introduced Rebecca and Isaac you
[44:47] didn't even hear anything about elea
[44:53] anymore but I'll say this you can't get
[44:57] rid of eler because eler is the only one
[44:59] who knew how to get back to Abraham's
[45:04] house Hallelujah eler knew the way back
[45:07] Hallelujah so you can't get rid of eler
[45:10] Hallelujah but eler did his job you know
[45:13] what I don't even think he got a thank
[45:15] you
[45:17] card for putting him
[45:22] together you know what he was happy to
[45:24] do it he wasn't looking for nothing else
[45:27] you know what he saw he saw a woman
[45:29] Hallelujah who was fundamental that
[45:32] could step into a
[45:35] vision
[45:37] who
[45:39] wow Rebecca comes out there and El and
[45:43] said he said Lord I can't choose no good
[45:46] woman he said I don't know what to
[45:48] choose he said but Lord let the woman
[45:51] that give me drink and give my camels
[45:53] drink let that be my Master's wife
[45:56] Hallelujah and Rebecca just mind her own
[45:58] business coming out there doing what she
[46:00] always did being fundamental she comes
[46:05] out there with a pots Hallelujah to draw
[46:07] water out the well which she always did
[46:10] but this day she was feels a little
[46:13] frisky this day she felt like doing
[46:16] something this day she came out there
[46:18] and she grabed she didn't know what was
[46:20] pushing her to do this but she she she
[46:23] grabbed that water she came Le say you
[46:25] want something to drink she said she say
[46:27] yes yes give her some water and she say
[46:29] just just go ahead drink have a good
[46:31] time I'm going to give some water for
[46:32] the camel then she go get water for
[46:34] Camel water for the
[46:36] C water the C now let me tell you
[46:39] something this way is not an easy way
[46:41] Hallelujah but when something is
[46:43] revealed to you you're happy in doing
[46:47] it Church Hallelujah you know one camel
[46:52] can drink 20 gallons of water
[47:00] that's a lot of water
[47:05] cuz she had to be more than just
[47:08] fundamental Hallelujah it had to be
[47:11] something Awakening and quicken in her
[47:13] Hallelujah cuz she goes back and PS
[47:16] those 20 gallons in one and comes back
[47:18] you know how many he had he had 10
[47:21] camels sisters when was the last time
[47:24] you went to Walmart and got 200 gallons
[47:26] of milk
[47:28] to feed the
[47:32] family that's who she was Hallelujah she
[47:35] didn't gripe she didn't complain she
[47:37] just went and did it she was anointed
[47:39] what did she do she stepped into the
[47:41] vision of her marriage supper
[47:45] W
[47:48] hallelujah oh
[47:50] my she stepped into the vision she went
[47:53] from just a fundamental day to
[47:55] fulfilling prophet
[47:58] prophecy that's who we
[48:01] are if you're truly bride if you're
[48:04] truly the message of the Y hour you'll
[48:06] find yourself fulfilling prophecy
[48:09] without even
[48:10] trying you just step into it because
[48:13] it's your time hallelujah what does it
[48:16] look like church oh my I got the cloth
[48:19] it's getting late what does it look like
[48:22] well I'll tell you what it looks like
[48:23] let me read this first though he says
[48:26] now
[48:27] he said but what was the difference what
[48:30] was the difference Hallelujah they only
[48:34] had the letter only had the word and
[48:37] these people had signs and
[48:43] wonders and before he got there he was
[48:46] given a type between Moab and Israel
[48:49] Moab had a prophet Hallelujah was bam
[48:53] amen Israel had a prophet who was Moses
[48:57] they had seven bullets seven Rams seven
[48:59] bullets seven Rams if you went on
[49:01] down Moab had everything they had but
[49:05] the only thing they didn't have was
[49:09] Vindication
[49:11] hallelujah hallelujah that's why I don't
[49:14] fuss and fight with people cuz it ain't
[49:16] my job to vindicate
[49:18] myself that's God's job Hallelujah if
[49:22] you're truly bride the bride of Christ
[49:25] God how many of you Brothers going to
[49:26] let somebody mess with your
[49:29] wife huh better not do it while I'm
[49:32] around I'm going tell you something
[49:35] hallelujah look Hallelujah even in the
[49:38] natural we Brothers we will what defend
[49:41] our spices spouses amen and vice versa
[49:45] Hallelujah one thing you don't do is
[49:47] mess with a woman her child and her
[49:50] husband
[49:58] you'll see what some holy ghost power is
[50:00] real
[50:01] quick
[50:03] Hallelujah don't talk about them don't
[50:05] say nothing Hallelujah you going to find
[50:07] out but that was the difference between
[50:10] those two one Hallelujah had the word
[50:14] only and the other one had the word and
[50:16] Vindication Hallelujah y'all know that
[50:20] there are people in this message who
[50:22] don't worship don't shout don't dance no
[50:25] manifestations of GI you know why cuz
[50:27] they say we got the
[50:35] word
[50:41] amen but the problem of God he comes
[50:43] back and he say for those who criticize
[50:45] him for the supernatural moving and
[50:47] gifts and all these different things he
[50:49] said now I'll show you where God gave it
[50:52] you show me where he took it away right
[50:56] and you think about it that's where we
[50:58] are Church Hallelujah you got people who
[51:01] hate to see people in church worshiping
[51:03] and singing It's to the music too
[51:07] loud the music too loud they moving too
[51:09] much the sisters moving too much stop
[51:11] looking at them
[51:15] then that's what it be it ain't that the
[51:19] sisters moving too much is that those
[51:21] people those men those Brothers still
[51:24] got lust spirits on them
[51:27] so what they'll do they'll fall back
[51:29] into legalism and say oh we shouldn't be
[51:31] doing that when the Bible say Miriam
[51:34] danced and shouted and praised God when
[51:36] the Bible it said and all the daughters
[51:38] of Zion the whole church was
[51:42] dancing yes sir oh boy I'm going to make
[51:46] some fundamentals
[51:48] mad I just I just love a nice quiet
[51:52] still the still small voice
[51:58] yeah that's
[51:59] Bible That's Bible but you know before
[52:02] you got there to the still Small Voice
[52:05] the scripture says God said go stand
[52:07] over there and I'mma move towards
[52:11] you am am I right is that what the word
[52:14] of God says it says that God moved and
[52:17] when God moved there was a Mighty
[52:19] rushian Wind when God moved a fire broke
[52:23] out when God moved there was an earth
[52:26] Quake so it was the moving of God that
[52:29] caused all those other manifestations so
[52:32] you can't say they ain't real
[52:35] right you can't say hallelujah somebody
[52:38] on fire dancing for the Lord ain't real
[52:42] you can't say hallelujah when the
[52:43] earthquake come in the church and shake
[52:45] the church up you can't say it ain't
[52:47] real you can't say that when the wind
[52:49] comes through that it ain't real because
[52:51] the Bible says when God moved it
[52:54] happened but that wasn't the way God
[52:56] wanted to speak to Elijah at that moment
[52:59] but that don't mean those manifestations
[53:01] Wen true
[53:03] manifestations Hallelujah because what
[53:05] was he on Mount Si Hallelujah he was an
[53:10] earthquake what was he Hallelujah at
[53:12] Pentecost he was a mighty Russian wi and
[53:15] the Bible says my God is who was he at
[53:18] Elijah Hallelujah stood there with the
[53:21] prophets of Bale what was he he was a
[53:23] god of
[53:24] fire amen
[53:27] so you can't pick and choose what's real
[53:29] and what
[53:30] not when you're fundamental you'll do
[53:34] that no you have to take the whole
[53:38] experience but church he look he said
[53:40] one was vind he said one had the word
[53:43] and the other one Hallelujah had signs
[53:45] and wonders but no
[53:47] doubt we all know I I shouldn't say we
[53:50] know people but you know where I'm at we
[53:53] all may have heard people say well we
[53:55] got the word we don't need need does and
[53:57] what your response ought to be well show
[54:00] me where God took it
[54:02] away cuz a anything that they say we
[54:06] don't need we ought to see what God took
[54:08] it away they could be right but just
[54:11] show it to me
[54:13] Hallelujah but I'm sorry to say you
[54:16] can't take my dancing away because God
[54:18] ain't took it away show it to me show it
[54:22] to me where it's a sin to dance in
[54:24] church I'm talking about under the
[54:26] spirit now I'm not talking about you go
[54:28] home and practice
[54:31] something now I ain't talking about that
[54:33] now now I ain't talking about you go
[54:35] home and premeditate some worship no
[54:37] that ain't
[54:39] God premeditate remember that sister she
[54:42] would premeditate she going to speak in
[54:43] tongues the prophet of God say he watch
[54:45] her pulling her Starin up pull her
[54:47] stockin up and she get ready say he say
[54:49] sit
[54:52] down he said I watch you mess up my
[54:54] service the past two night sit down now
[54:57] and the fundamental people who just want
[54:59] to hear something went up to him and say
[55:01] brother brand she had something from the
[55:03] Lord he said man sit down and be
[55:07] quiet see when is truly of God it will
[55:11] not hit like two Rams it'll
[55:17] blend Hallelujah Andy church we are in a
[55:21] place where we should see the blending
[55:23] of the two in our lives yeah we got the
[55:27] word but we also got
[55:29] Spirit Hallelujah Faith to believe in
[55:32] what God has done look and some people
[55:35] don't shout simply because they just
[55:36] don't want
[55:38] to and I ain't mad at you you just be
[55:40] dead I'm I'm going do what I'm going do
[55:42] Hallelujah I'm going to worship I'm
[55:44] going to give God thanks Hallelujah and
[55:47] some people may just cry some people may
[55:50] just raise their hand but whatever you
[55:51] do Hallelujah don't just be
[55:53] fundamental Let There Be spirit behind
[55:56] it let there be Vindication behind it I
[55:59] know a pastor friend of mine he said he
[56:02] was kind of you know he he he was kind
[56:04] of uh critical about dancing in church
[56:08] wasn't the prophet at one time
[56:10] yes he was kind of critical he said a
[56:13] sister broke out and start dancing in
[56:15] the spirit and he he was standing in the
[56:17] aisle he said God if this if this is of
[56:20] you she won't even touch me
[56:26] now I don't know if I'll try God like
[56:28] that but that's what he needed he needed
[56:32] that he needed that to see if God was
[56:35] real or not and he said he stood there
[56:38] and that sister came down dancing in the
[56:40] spirit eyes closed and spinning around
[56:42] and everything he said he was standing
[56:43] in the aisle like this he said when she
[56:45] got to her when she got to him it was
[56:48] like she was just dancing in front of
[56:50] them like you can't stop this and you
[56:53] say she just dance for a little bit and
[56:55] then she just spent around went all the
[56:57] way around him and continued on down the
[57:01] aisle from that point his criticism
[57:06] left
[57:08] Hallelujah because God did that for him
[57:10] because he needed
[57:12] Vindication now I ain't saying that to
[57:14] say that we need to be testing people
[57:16] worship and all this stuff you know
[57:18] that's childish to me Hallelujah leave
[57:21] people alone let them do what they do
[57:22] that's why we got
[57:24] pastors Hallelujah see I learned this
[57:26] lesson on my own this is personal I
[57:29] learned this lesson as an evangelist and
[57:31] sometime as an evangelist you sit in
[57:33] church and you see things I'm like boy
[57:34] Pastor need to whip them
[57:40] good that's all thinking that's how some
[57:43] of y'all been
[57:45] thinking brother our brother Aaron let
[57:47] this go he need to go blast them he know
[57:50] they off that relationship ain't right
[57:53] he need to blast it why he let them come
[57:55] to church like that that ain't none of
[57:57] your business he the
[58:00] pastor you just be humble and support
[58:02] the ministry H am Hallelujah that's
[58:05] problema we won't control thing no just
[58:07] don't be a
[58:08] Pharisee that's right Let Jesus
[58:11] operate Hallelujah hardest thing for us
[58:14] to do is mind our
[58:17] business and you know Church Hallelujah
[58:20] you know you think about the grace of
[58:22] God you know I sit in my trial and I say
[58:24] Lord you need to just do something with
[58:25] us
[58:27] and God comes and he say me say
[58:31] look there was only one John the
[58:33] Baptist and that was not
[58:41] you sit down shut your mouth and support
[58:46] your
[58:47] pastor that's the reason why he's a
[58:49] pastor and you're an evangelist because
[58:52] there's things that he can see beyond
[58:55] what's going on that you
[58:57] can't because he has a gift to deal with
[58:59] people and their
[59:02] lives sorry most evangelists don't have
[59:05] that gift we just whip
[59:10] us hallelujah we call a blast break tear
[59:14] up
[59:15] shock that's who we are Hallelujah but I
[59:18] love you
[59:20] though Hallelujah you might not think it
[59:22] but I love you I love you amen if I
[59:24] didn't love you I wouldn't be my I get
[59:26] back here and stand back here like Aaron
[59:28] and praise the
[59:30] Lord would you like to say Amen Church
[59:33] you know if Aaron watching now I'm sorry
[59:36] but I had to get
[59:37] you Hallelujah you know I couldn't be
[59:40] him if I tried to Hallelujah because God
[59:43] made him that way and can y'all imagine
[59:45] Aaron being like
[59:48] me what y'all might not realize in his
[59:50] younger days now that boy was fiery now
[59:53] younger days Aaron used to chop up some
[59:55] stuff
[59:56] when God Chang his ministry why for
[1:00:00] you Hallelujah let me finish up
[1:00:07] Hallelujah I've been preaching about an
[1:00:11] hour Hallelujah he said the difference
[1:00:13] is one got the word one doesn't have the
[1:00:16] word hallelujah I mean one one has the
[1:00:18] word and spirit amen that's what we want
[1:00:21] we want word and life Hallelujah because
[1:00:23] if you got the word you should have life
[1:00:27] amen you shouldn't be cold stagnated
[1:00:30] dead in church talking
[1:00:32] about I got faith I'm a Believer we got
[1:00:35] the word if you got the substance of God
[1:00:39] there should be life there amen there
[1:00:41] should be multiplication there
[1:00:43] Hallelujah there should be Dominion
[1:00:45] there amen there should be somebody
[1:00:47] looking at you hungering what you
[1:00:51] got oh my look he says now if teaching
[1:00:55] the B
[1:00:56] if fundamental action is all God
[1:00:59] requires he's Duty bound to anybody who
[1:01:02] will do
[1:01:04] it my Cain
[1:01:08] Esau he said God knows his church and
[1:01:12] vindicates his church with signs and
[1:01:14] wonders now before I close what does
[1:01:17] that look like amen look at the
[1:01:19] Centurion when he saw Jesus operating
[1:01:22] and doing whatever he do he said hey
[1:01:24] went to the Lord he said Lord
[1:01:27] you ain't even got to come to my
[1:01:30] house but then he starts describing who
[1:01:34] he
[1:01:36] is he saw the manifestation of Christ
[1:01:40] but what he saw in Christ he also saw in
[1:01:43] his
[1:01:45] life Hallelujah he didn't see a
[1:01:48] difference in the gospel when he saw
[1:01:50] Christ which is the gospel he saw
[1:01:52] himself and that's what we should see
[1:01:55] when we read this message we should see
[1:01:57] ourself not just brother brandom
[1:02:00] Hallelujah when we read the Bible
[1:02:02] Hallelujah we should just see Peter
[1:02:04] James and John Abraham we should see
[1:02:08] ourselves think about the church now
[1:02:10] this was going to shock you he said the
[1:02:12] Propet God said when you read the Bible
[1:02:14] you should see Christ in every
[1:02:21] word so if I can see Christ in every
[1:02:23] word and Christ lives in me who else
[1:02:28] should I
[1:02:30] see I know some of you afraid of that
[1:02:32] one Hallelujah but you should also see
[1:02:35] yourself Hallelujah the Centurion he
[1:02:38] says Hey without I he say I'm a man
[1:02:41] under like Authority The Authority he
[1:02:44] saw in God he could identify with it
[1:02:47] amen he wasn't just fundamental
[1:02:49] Hallelujah he was a man of Faith H he
[1:02:52] said hey I believe just like how you
[1:02:55] operating when when I say go they go
[1:02:56] when I say do they do when I say come
[1:02:58] they come he said Lord just speak the
[1:03:01] word hallelujah that's when the two
[1:03:07] entl when you see it but then you
[1:03:10] realize you got the ability to make it
[1:03:14] happen
[1:03:15] Hallelujah why because Christ lives in
[1:03:18] you you see the reflection of God in you
[1:03:21] Hallelujah and he says speak the word
[1:03:23] the word only and then Jesus said the
[1:03:26] Bible says he marveled and and and I
[1:03:29] believe in Luke he turned them around
[1:03:31] and he told everybody he said look at
[1:03:33] this he said I hadn't seen us no not in
[1:03:35] all
[1:03:36] Israel why because everybody else a
[1:03:39] fundamental but this man was living by
[1:03:43] Authority Hallelujah he had Pentecost of
[1:03:46] Faith like who just like the
[1:03:50] disciples because the disciples life was
[1:03:52] so real in Acts chapter 4 when they came
[1:03:55] they say we thought we killed
[1:03:59] Jesus but the Bible said they took
[1:04:02] notice of them that they had been with
[1:04:04] who
[1:04:06] Jesus what happened they seen the same
[1:04:09] life it wasn't just
[1:04:12] fundamental it was the same signs and
[1:04:14] wonders Hallelujah and you go from there
[1:04:17] who else Paul Hallelujah Paul went from
[1:04:20] just Hallelujah the teachings of gamea
[1:04:23] which was fundamental to meet Jesus was
[1:04:25] was what the pill of fire Hallelujah
[1:04:28] when he met the pill of fire which was
[1:04:30] what a type of the Holy Ghost shining in
[1:04:33] his life W he wasn't dead Pentecost like
[1:04:36] the rest of them was but he met the pill
[1:04:38] of fire with Jesus say I am
[1:04:41] he Hallelujah and it came alive to Paul
[1:04:45] Hallelujah and when it came alive he
[1:04:47] went from just being fundamental to get
[1:04:50] the name
[1:04:51] changed saw to
[1:04:54] Paul that's why the of God will say I no
[1:04:57] longer call you church but I call you
[1:05:00] bride cuz we're not just supposed to be
[1:05:02] fundamental
[1:05:03] people we're supposed to be fundamental
[1:05:06] people with Pentecostal Faith
[1:05:09] hallelujah what is Pentecostal
[1:05:13] faith I'm
[1:05:17] closing I'm going help you out I said
[1:05:19] I'm
[1:05:23] closing I know somebody wanted to say
[1:05:25] thank
[1:05:27] god oh it seems like we've been in
[1:05:29] church a long
[1:05:32] time
[1:05:34] Hallelujah you know people say say boy
[1:05:36] if I was in Jesus day oh man it been
[1:05:39] such a
[1:05:41] time and you imagine being out there
[1:05:44] Christ
[1:05:48] speaking some of us wouldn't even be
[1:05:50] able to pay attention that
[1:05:52] long some of us might even walk away
[1:05:56] think about it Jesus was preaching one
[1:05:59] time in a boat out in the water and
[1:06:01] everybody was on
[1:06:03] lay I can't hear I can't I can't I I
[1:06:07] can't hear man I'm going
[1:06:13] home but I believe his voice was so in
[1:06:16] tune with the hearts and the ears of
[1:06:19] people that he didn't have to raise his
[1:06:21] voice when he spoke it with directly to
[1:06:24] those who would receive
[1:06:27] Hallelujah and I believe he's still that
[1:06:29] same God tonight Hallelujah Well church
[1:06:32] as we look and we think about it
[1:06:34] Hallelujah when you look at the the the
[1:06:36] the the the the fundamental man becoming
[1:06:40] the Pentecostal man of faith and they
[1:06:42] intertwining what is it it's the baptism
[1:06:45] of the Holy Ghost on
[1:06:48] display Hallelujah cuz before the holy
[1:06:52] spirit all of the disciples were
[1:06:54] fundamental
[1:06:57] they healed the sick they raised the
[1:06:59] dead they did all that stuff at the same
[1:07:01] time when they were doing that Peter get
[1:07:03] mad and cuss you
[1:07:07] out uh
[1:07:11] oh still do a little
[1:07:14] cussing just fundamental you get so

[1:07:24] give you a piece of my
[1:07:27] M El Peter he's fundamental he's with
[1:07:30] the church and cuss you slam
[1:07:34] out and might even say in Jesus
[1:07:37] name I hope he do that but church not
[1:07:41] only that Hallelujah he was so
[1:07:44] fundamental he was with he was with
[1:07:47] Jesus Healing The Sick raising the Dead
[1:07:49] doing all these things and you know who
[1:07:51] else was with them Judas
[1:07:55] the sick raising the Dead doing all that
[1:07:57] stuff The Devil Is
[1:08:04] Fundamental he was right there doing it
[1:08:07] all and Jesus say what are you is a
[1:08:09] devil and everybody say Lord is it me is
[1:08:11] it I he said me they want to pin the
[1:08:13] finger they want to put it on somebody
[1:08:15] said no you just got to keep
[1:08:17] living just keep living don't worry
[1:08:19] about who it
[1:08:21] is Peter got so mad one day they came to
[1:08:23] get Jesus he chopped somebody ear
[1:08:27] off while he was Healing The Sick
[1:08:30] racing doing all that stuff and you you
[1:08:35] believe he was a ear but I I don't
[1:08:37] believe he was that precise he said
[1:08:39] I'mma cut a ear off
[1:08:40] today N I believe you aiming for a neck
[1:08:43] but the grace of God say it's only going
[1:08:45] to be a
[1:08:47] ear Hallelujah Church there been plenty
[1:08:50] of times we would have messed up bad but
[1:08:52] it's the grace of God
[1:08:55] when we were living in our
[1:08:57] fundamentalism Hallelujah but look at
[1:09:00] what happened Hallelujah after Jesus but
[1:09:03] when when he Jesus said you know what
[1:09:05] I'mma die in three days I'mma rise if
[1:09:07] before he got dead Peter said no Lord
[1:09:09] you ain't going to do that you can be
[1:09:10] fundamental and deny the
[1:09:14] word he looked Jesus right in his face
[1:09:17] and say Lord you ain't going to do that
[1:09:19] what did Jesus say
[1:09:21] Satan walking with the church and could
[1:09:24] be possessed by a
[1:09:29] devil but he was fundamental
[1:09:33] though he said Satan get behind me Lord
[1:09:35] you should not sh Satan get behind me
[1:09:38] and Peter say Lord I'mma follow you
[1:09:40] wherever you go Jesus said man you going
[1:09:42] to deny me three times not me Lord I go
[1:09:45] he said you deny me three times for the
[1:09:46] cold and he say people say they going to
[1:09:49] one Peter said not me somebody came yeah
[1:09:52] I think I'm one of the disciple he said
[1:09:53] not me
[1:09:55] and went on a little bit took a little
[1:09:57] bit about time he said yeah Peter he
[1:09:59] said didn't I tell you so and
[1:10:02] so leave me
[1:10:05] alone and then that
[1:10:15] thing and then his
[1:10:18] fundamentalism looked into the eyes of
[1:10:20] Jesus can you imagine how that
[1:10:24] felt God telling you you going to do
[1:10:26] something you say not me I ain't going
[1:10:27] to do it and you do it anyway because he
[1:10:30] know you not there
[1:10:34] yet Church we're in a time now when you
[1:10:38] hear the word and the pastor preacher or
[1:10:40] the ministry preaching and it's at your
[1:10:43] doorstep open the door and receive it
[1:10:46] because it's God's grace don't get angry
[1:10:48] with the ministry it's God's Grace
[1:10:50] trying to get you to that level that
[1:10:52] next level that he know you ain't at yet
[1:10:55] don't live in denial Peter was living in
[1:10:58] denial not me Lord
[1:11:02] father and now he looking at looking at
[1:11:04] bible say he looked at Jesus can you
[1:11:08] imagine I don't know about y'all I
[1:11:10] probably been shaking in my boots God
[1:11:12] told me I was going to do it and I did
[1:11:14] it and I cuss everybody out while I did
[1:11:21] it that's why he walked away
[1:11:27] cuz he didn't have nothing to keep
[1:11:29] him if you just
[1:11:32] fundamental until you come into a birth
[1:11:35] one day you going to walk
[1:11:37] away even though you seen signs and
[1:11:39] wonders and I mean you you you you did
[1:11:42] things and you was a part of the church
[1:11:43] you studied this message 20 years 30
[1:11:46] years people walk I know a brother who
[1:11:47] got powerful testimonies walked
[1:11:50] away in the name in in the name of this
[1:11:54] message powerful Tes walked
[1:11:58] away church and he didn't got to a place
[1:12:04] Hallelujah when Jesus rose
[1:12:07] Hallelujah he rose who the first one he
[1:12:10] said go
[1:12:12] tell go tell Peter Hallelujah the one
[1:12:16] that everybody was looking crazy
[1:12:18] at the one who cuss everybody out the
[1:12:21] one who chop ears off all he say go tell
[1:12:24] Peter I have risen
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:27] Hallelujah
[1:12:28] Glory they did Hallelujah they meet back
[1:12:31] up Hallelujah with Christ oh my
[1:12:35] Hallelujah they me back up with Christ
[1:12:37] and then Jesus tell him he said go to
[1:12:39] Jerusalem and wait go wait Hallelujah
[1:12:41] and as they waited you know when they
[1:12:43] was waiting fundamentally they were
[1:12:48] afraid cuz they were just being attacked
[1:12:50] a few minutes ago not in the upper room
[1:12:53] afraid waiting
[1:12:57] the Pentecostal move in the book of Acts
[1:13:00] was not about
[1:13:03] gifts it was not about speaking in
[1:13:07] tongues what was it in church it
[1:13:11] was moving away from being
[1:13:14] fundamental to the Holy Ghost giving you
[1:13:18] power to not be afraid to live this
[1:13:22] gospel amen amen
[1:13:26] there we are that's us people don't
[1:13:29] understand this message but the Holy
[1:13:30] Ghost makes us
[1:13:32] unafraid to live
[1:13:35] it say what you want to say about the
[1:13:38] prophet say what you want to say about
[1:13:39] me I know what God has done for me the
[1:13:42] Holy Ghost hallelujah what did it do
[1:13:44] Hallelujah when the Holy Ghost s at
[1:13:46] Pentecost what did it do it made those
[1:13:49] fundamental Believers operate in
[1:13:51] Pentecostal Faith because the ministry
[1:13:54] of Jesus Christ what did it do it it it
[1:13:57] opened their hearts up to believe
[1:14:00] everything not in fear it took the fear
[1:14:04] away because when they came down this
[1:14:07] time those same people that persecuted
[1:14:09] them and said all this stuff Peter stood
[1:14:11] out the very one who denied it he stood
[1:14:13] out he said this is
[1:14:15] that that the prophet Joel talked about
[1:14:18] we not drunk as you suppose this is the

[1:17:21] past that don't fail to realize it's my
[1:17:24] flaws that that makes me a
[1:17:27] masterpiece hallelujah hallelujah when
[1:17:31] Michelangelo hit that statue and he HD
[1:17:34] it over the knee the prophet of God said
[1:17:36] it looked like so much of the vision of
[1:17:38] what was in his mind he thought that
[1:17:40] stone could talk amen and he hit it on
[1:17:44] the knee because it looked so real so he
[1:17:48] said it was the flaw in the knee that
[1:17:50] was the Vindication of how real it was
[1:17:52] to him
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:18:00] let's not judge one another about the
[1:18:01] trials they going through because
[1:18:04] they're specially made for the
[1:18:05] individual I can't go through what you
[1:18:07] go through and you can't go through what
[1:18:08] I go through Hallelujah and you might be
[1:18:11] looking at me mind saying that brother
[1:18:13] is not bride and God is saying I got him
[1:18:15] going through this because he's bride or
[1:18:18] I got her going through this because
[1:18:19] she's bride hallah think about the
[1:18:22] church if you if we would judge
[1:18:24] everybody on what they went through
[1:18:26] Hallelujah we'll say people ain't saved
[1:18:28] we'll say David wasn't saved we'll say
[1:18:31] Joshua wasn't saved Hallelujah I mean uh
[1:18:34] Joseph wasn't saved definitely Jacob
[1:18:37] wasn't
[1:18:39] saved and the father Faith oh Lord the
