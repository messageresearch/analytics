TRANSCRIPT
========================================
turn to second corinthians chapter one i'd like to read verses 1 to 11 and mention that uh what we're reading here i want to come back to and if you could maybe take notice as we read today that there's a lot of um acting together of the first and second corinthians a lot of principles that paul expresses to the corinthian church and we're going to be touching on i want you kind of see this theme and some continuity in that second corinthians chapter 1 verses 1 to 11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother under the church of god who is at corinth with all the saints which are in all acaiah grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort i just love that phrase the god of all comforter and then who comfort us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort where we we ourselves are comforted of god so notice that god the god of all comfort comforts us but then we are a source of comfort for others for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffered or whatever we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast by the law minister on steadfast faith here's the steadfastness that bring that steadfast faith bringing a steadfast hope knowing that as you're partakers of the suffering so shall you be also of the consolation this is where i'd like to focus on he says for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia from his other writings is speaking of some difficulty he had in lystra where he was facing death as he explicitly lays it out here that we were pressed out of measure of strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death on ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead who delivered us from so great at death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ye also helping together by prayer force that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf god bless you you can be seated continue on the subject this is part nine of barriers and boundaries we've started a sub-subject on love has limits and i know it is kind of maybe a little bit of a catchy uh phrase or title to say love has limits because i think there is a little bit of uh even in the nominal world today there's uh kind of a message and agenda that love has no limits and it's kind of used to express the idea that love can exist in many different expressions and relationships and many different forms and that we should not uh redefine love to exclude certain affinities affections lust or desires from the definition of love and so i'm not this isn't a counter attack against uh those yard signs but it is uh more looking to the love of god and how god's love is expressed to us and it's kind of when you think about barriers and boundaries it's we've mentioned this before that we're trying to express things in a way that you can better understand your relationship to god and then there's kind of we can extrapolate from that principles to help our relationships with each other but when we say love has limits we're explicitly saying that it has boundaries in that it is defined a certain way so that it expresses itself in a very specific manner that uh when that love is identifiable and that there's things that we can say is are not love or not expressive of love and so there's a framework within it within the it acts like it's going to act in a certain way it's going to look a certain way has parameters that it moves within and it's also it provokes as the bible says provoke one another unto love and to good works there's a way that when it's provoked it's when love is expressed it provokes something and brother brown talks about and ministers at a number of occasions on divine love projected when love projects and so there's a way that it projects and in those sermons he's identifying how that when that love went forth it brought something out the object of that was responded back and came back and so we are called and you can find this in the scripture that we are to project divine love that we're called to project it ourselves that's what christ did is he projected love and it's not in the same sense that we have to love everybody in the uh the worldly way in which they try to characterize christian love or love but we're to project the love of god and that's what christ did so love has a certain way that it acts and when love is acting as a certain thing that it ought to provoke and we were looking in first corinthians chapter 13 and i've just provided verses four to eight here so that you could look at this and this is the way that we broke it out how that what love is it suffers long so love is patient and love is kind and what it does it rejoices in truth it bears all things believes all things hope it their trust all things and endures all things these are the characteristics of charity divine love agape love and then what love isn't it is not puffed up it's not arrogant has an inflated erroneous view of itself it's not easily provoked means it's not easily irritated or angered and then what love doesn't it does not envy it does not vaunt itself does not behave indecently does not seek her own does not think evil does not rejoice in iniquity and charity does not fail charity never faileth and it loops us back in to how charity suffers long it kind of creates this picture that rounds out and i've used even that that symbol of eternity even when i was thinking how love have limits and you think about eternity how it's expressed that it rounds out and cuts out certain things this is what love is and everything else exists on the outside of that and on the subject of love it's so vast that you could you could start with love part one and we could preach about love until the body change he's well how in the world would you pull that off the bible says god is love right god is his word so you can just from that just like we're preaching jesus christ uh part 1 billion or whatever it might be in terms of all the sermons that have ever been preached we're always preaching jesus christ and none other that's who we preach and at first john 4 8 he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love so there's if god has bound himself if god has things he cannot do and god is not man that he should lie and there's certain things that god has expressed himself in and god is loved and that that's just a very simple way for you to begin to think about what's in my heart when i say that love has limits it's not that we are strictly defining it as carnal people to fit a paradigm that meets our needs but it's to begin to think more directly and specifically about god's love towards us and how that ought to be projected from us so that it can be effective and i want to mention this briefly and i went back last night and just took out um all the scriptures and quotes that i had on this subject to say for another time and so i want to mention it now and hopefully we'll repeat these things in the near future but i want to speak for a moment just on the sovereignty of god because when we talk about love and how it's expressed and we begin to ponder the the uh the attributes and characteristics of love and what it is and what it isn't then there's a way that we could kind of make assumptions about it and be like oh well then this is the template this is the figure of love this is how love acts and we try to impose that on god himself and we when we when we do that we've missed something somewhere if it doesn't fit if god's not fitting the image if his actions and his words aren't fitting the image that we have of love then we don't try to change god to fit our image we've got to change what we what we see and how what we understand about love and so on the sovereignty of god we cannot force an image of love or kindness or decency and these things upon god that would make him evil or that make him act contrary to the nature of love because god is love and his providence and when we talk about his providence his purpose and his uh what he produces his purpose and that even his product is far beyond our understanding his ways are higher his thoughts are higher it's beyond ourselves it's beyond our comprehension and to us what might appear to be cruel uh uh unfair even just indifferent cannot be so with god's word if it seems cruel and indifferent if it seems unjust uh that you cannot associate those terms in their truth and in their purity to god's actions because the bible teaches us that no wickedness or no evil is attributed attributable to god you cannot attach evil mode to evil to his motives you cannot attach wickedness to his objective and as we we remind you quite often we cannot take our sense of decency and fairness and equity and justice and then expect god to abide by that just look at mankind and i'd love to spend more time on justice and on this subject of the sovereignty of god but just think of all the ways that we have as humans have tried to come up with a way to measure fairness right in a criminal justice system we have a jury of peers and in a civil justice system you have a judge and a trier of fact and even a jury in those situations as well and even in economics what's a fair price right if you're a seller a high one's fair if you're a buyer a low one's fair so they leave it to market dynamics to produce a medium that would be a fair market value is what they call it and these are just all the efforts of man to determine what's fair but when it comes to god whatever he says is truth and whatever he does is just because god is right he is good all the time and this is this so we can't just take god's actions like oh well that doesn't fit this and that doesn't fit that but what you want to do is have an understanding of the word of god and the knowledge of jesus christ and then know that god is going to act in harmony with his word and if something doesn't seem to act then maybe you're not looking at god what you've attributed to god maybe that's not god or maybe what you have taken as an assumption of what the nature and character of the word is maybe it's not right because it's not fitting what god does who god is and as the bible says that charity does not behave indecently unseemly as the word that's translated in the king james version it means it does not act in a way that's unfitting or inappropriate and i feel like i'm wanting to express something now to moderate uh kind of the way that we defined it on sunday don't get nervous i'm not going to retract anything uh necessarily but i want to uh kind of be a little bit more precise in my language because it means it's not it does not behave in a way that's unfitting or inappropriate it does not behave dishonorably i think we talked about it doesn't it's not disrespectful and i use the phrase uh intentionally uh involuntarily offensive and as i was studying this week i felt that that word offense or offended offended or offensive takes on a little bit broader meaning in society today and maybe the way that we use it and we must realize that jesus christ is offensive the word is offensive and and that we ought not to take too much issue with what is offensive and just realize that everyone has a right to offend and you have a right to be offended and so it's not that love is not offensive uh but it is not intentionally hurtful and it's not doing it for the purpose of spite and for the purpose of disrespect and saying because people do that all the time they take the word of god they take the message of the hour and they use it to cause harm they do it intentionally to be offensive when the word is offensive and it's in just its purity you don't need to defile it to make it offensive just keep it pure and it'll offend on its own so it's in that sense that it's not disrespectful or inappropriate or unfitting so if it's appropriate it can still be offensive but we're talking more of hurts that intend harm or that are meant to afflict and so we looked at that in the sense of what's appropriate it said love renders what is due so it is it does what is appropriate and what is just and what is righteous is not always what is nice right what it what is what is uh comports with the nature of god is not always what we think is uh cordial or kind and so love is proper love is decent is what the scripture is saying but not necessarily inoffensive if it's proper and decent if it's appropriate it means it's in harmony with the word of god the nature of god the word of god that's what it means and so if the word is offensive then offenses must be brother ron peterson shares what to me is one of the one of the funnier stories you'll hear about witnessing and he said when they were first serving the lord and he i was sharing with they were out on the beach and they found a hippie with long hair and i believe it was brother ron who might have challenged him and said you know don't you know the bible teaches that it's a shame for a man to have long hair and the guy just said so i'm ashamed you know it's like where do we go from there and so we don't necessarily we're not just we don't want to just shame people we don't want to just provoke these feelings of condemnation and guilt but the word can produce those kind of results and those kind of feelings but as long as it's the word you've got to leave the word is what does the cutting it's what does the uh does the work and does the tearing down and building up we don't need to try to do it ourselves and so god is righteous in his conduct they're just wanting to just get this idea of the sovereignty of god and it's never evil though it might be offensive so if there's things that transpire in your life or you see things happen in the lives of others we can't begin to try to figure out god's love because it's not always going to fit our figure of love and we have to realize that if it's god then it has a purpose if it's god then he has an objective and you cannot attach any evil product or any evil motive to that and so there's that's just a little snippet on the sovereignty of god that i want to be a part of this so now love has limits and as we've used this idea of the sovereignty of god it doesn't always act the way that we think it should it does not always look in the way that we think it should look and we ended with this and we're just picking up with this um this morning love is not does not manipulate and and is not manipulated so if if you can be manipulated that it's not love that's going to be manipulated if you are manipulative that's not really love that's acting i know that's maybe just food for thought and we could have a breakout session and just kind of stare at each other for a while thinking um you know there's a lot there but the bible says about charity it seeks not her own this is what i want when we talk about manipulation uh even the the the word manipulate uh has an innocent meaning to it or it has a way of just thinking something being handled and used for a particular purpose and so manipulation in one sense isn't wrong except that it's come to mean and i'm using in this sense because it's kind of the the tones that the word is used for that it's something that's done for its own advantage or gain when you manipulate somebody you're wanting them to do something essentially for your own gain but then there's a way that you can act to motivate somebody and what you're wanting them to do is accomplish something for their own benefit so there's a difference between being manipulated and motivated it'd be really good to know when that's happening right at all time lord give me the gift of knowing the difference between manipulation and motivation and give you the courage to act upon it accordingly and so then the bible says that charity seeks not her own it's selfless it's selfless in that it does not act for its own advantage it does not act solely for its own gain but it will act also for your benefit and for your gain so it's not just merely if you look at god and his objective and his plan he's not looking that everything would just work out so that he is magnified and he is great and he is exalted and christ has declared the ruler and the king of all but that he might also share his glory with you and so it's not it's it's when it says that charity seeks not her own we cannot say oh well charity is so selfless and so unselfish that it can be completely manipulated and taken advantage of and left wasted to where nothing exists but it means more that it will not solely act for its own benefit but it acts for your benefit as well as paul writes in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 we're drawing a lot from first and second corinthians he says for the love of christ constraineth us and we used this last time the love of christ constraineth us it means it holds us together lest we would fall to pieces it means it presses me in and holds me together on every side it holds complete it binds me it sets boundaries about me and holds me together and paul is saying my conduct has been restrained because of the love of christ the love of christ can actually say stop there the love of christ is holding me together and keeping me from flowing out into this and gushing about that or being too harsh about this paul is saying that i am i'm restrained by love because i have to act according to the word and also for your benefit we cannot be masters of tearing things down without also being a master of building back up what was one of the things that we identified in the series on who is my neighbor where this this robber was left we talked about are we the thieves we take somebody and strip them of everything they believe and all their convictions and you strip them from their wilderness and you strip them from everything that's wrong but you give them nothing to be clothed with you give them no truth and we have to be very careful that we're not thieves where we're just constantly taking things away from people and stripping them and laying them bare and so paul is saying my conduct is restrained to act according to the word but then that word must also be effective and beneficial for its intended recipient and we were making reference to this that love is is protective of god's purpose so if it's going to act it always keeps in mind what the overall objective is and you find that in some organizations and certain maybe it's more corporate dynamics and maybe certain operating groups and maybe just at a loss for the word that maybe would kind of gather a lot of these different situations in but they have kind of an overall objective and so they don't need to necessarily give all the specifics of what you should do in this situation what you should do in that situation and they don't have to answer everything and have a manual that says well when this happens do this but they can just give kind of an overarching theme and say you know what at the end of the day our goal is to accomplish this and so in everything you do ask yourself will it meet that objective in the end is this is this being accomplished is this purpose and this vision and this objective being supported through these activities we say that love is the same way in that it acts fiercely protective of god's purpose and it's always it always looks back to what god's intent is and looks forward to what the outcome will be in god's eyes and it may be offensive and as you can see i'm wanting to be sure that we kind of recognize that there can be what is offense but it is it never harms god's objective romans 13 10 says love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law i mean that's that's heavy stuff isn't it to think that even paul is he's picking up what jesus says and and all the laws and all the prophets hang on this these commandments love worketh no ill no evil to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law there's something so remarkable expressed in that that it's worth pondering and it was one of the things that god immediately remember it was in june of 2020 brother mike i'm thinking of when we were in happy belated birthday i was thinking about how we were sitting down and just it crystallized god has called me to start a church here in phoenix and immediately god began to deal with martyr who is my neighbor and and when i look back and see that it's the that the working no ill to your neighbor is it shows that love is the fulfilling of the law this is something that has a lot of weight to it a lot of depth to it not this shallow ecclesiastical love not the shallow theological love not not the christian scientist kind of love and and not the love that has no limits in the world today but something that's rooted in the character of god love restrains us from evil he says love worketh no ill to his neighbor it does not injure does not defile does not a defraud does not deprive love is not going to defraud somebody else love is not going to deprive someone else what they're do love will also not grant to one something that would harm them unreasonably so we talked we mentioned i think it was as we were closing last time how that love is not pushy uh sometimes we we say well i'm doing this out of love you're like really well you could have smiled oh and uh maybe you say brother aaron take some of your own medicine because i i think uh sometimes i preach and i'm preaching about the love of god and it's almost like i have my teeth clenched but love is not pushy now there's a there's not a pressure and i that the world would use this force and i find myself kind of chasing something where brother branham identifies it the church age book and it's something that i've been very very moved by how that we could use this idea of love but you find at the end of the day it's this force that's being used to accomplish something i had a coach in high school baseball that used fear as a motivator and that's what he felt fear is a great motivator fear's a great motivator and you find that god does not use fear to motivate he uses he motivates by faith and so if fear is being used it's not really at the end of the day the motivation of god but it's the manipulation of emotions and and other factors if we couldn't say maybe just an evil at worst it's the devil at best it's yourself or your friend or whatever it is but love is not doesn't have that kind of force to manipulate and it's not a pushover in that it can be pressured itself or coerced or manipulated into doing something that doesn't reflect the nature and character of a christian and that way i'm saying love has limits the love of god is in your heart the bible says if you if the love of god is in you but you love you know if you love the things of the world and you and you have a love for the things it says the love of god is not in you okay that's that's signaling something that man there's a context for love that we have to grasp and understand now whether we realize it or not you might recognize a little bit of a transition here whether we realize it or not we all have personal thresholds anybody heard the phrase pain tolerance i feel like i've got a high pain tolerance but i still don't like pain i i never quite understood the concept of a haunted house why would i want to walk through something and scare myself to death why do i don't subject myself to that but some other people like man can they not come up with a message haunted house like a christian themed haunted house i mean i really want to spit you know i want to really want to lean into halloween or whatever horror movies is there a christian horror genre and i'm like why would you even want to do that what's the point and so some people have different thresholds and what they consider to be fun and what they consider to be uh enjoyable and so it's in that way i want you to begin to think that some people like like hot stuff right you know and they give say wow i like it hot and you realize they don't care about the taste they just don't want to feel anything once this thing just bites into them so hard it's like yeah that's really hot it has no taste no flavor it's just there to inflict pain and there's some people that really like that and i'm like you know what i like spicy but i don't like that and so that's just saying that there's people have thresholds they have um things and i mention it in an external way but what i want you to begin to think about is more of internal boundaries that we all have these personal thresholds that may not be obvious on the outside defining our physical boundaries is very easy right this body's wearing this suit you know exactly where i'm at you know i'm not walking up and down the aisles right now you can see me and so this is defining my space we have physical boundaries and it's easier to recognize those because we can recognize our external limits even if you want to think it turns out how high you can jump or how fast you can run or how far you can see we have all sorts of ways of defining what are our boundaries and our limits and our extent of of existence and that would extend to as a church we don't have a physical building that we own but we gather here uh and we're within these four walls and there's a way that we can define space to say yeah these are boundaries and we can readily identify structures as establishing someone's personal space personal property the external things the tangible things the physical things but what's harder to see are the boundaries that are related to personal limits you realize that if i'm here i can't be there at the same time if i'm here behind the pulp and i can't be in my car uh um if you're at home streaming you're not here in church there's a way that you immediately begin to recognize these are limits but what are harder to recognize is things that are not seen there's uh ways that we even we begin to look at somebody and we're trying to gauge their response and how are they reacting and how are they responding and i remember in high school there was i had a friend that i joked in a particular way with them and he always seemed to kind of laugh and and he never seemed to be offended but i asked him one day i said david does that bother you and he said oh yeah every time and i felt mortified i was like wow this guy played it off as if we're just having fun you know tell all the jokes you want about me and you realize no that's not everybody it may seem like they're rolling with it it may seem like they're fine but they have something inside of them that's responding to it and you don't see it physically but you're about you're you're crossing some boundary in their heart and so we're talking about things that might be emotional limits spiritual spiritual limits that individuals have and you you know there's there's some people that have a nature about them that they can subject themselves to certain circumstances like i can't do that i i i or that's so or you think other people say why can't you do this and why don't you do that there's just certain things that people are natured a particular way and not everybody's called to the same calling now that one's asked to do the same thing and i'm re we're identifying things that aren't readily identifiable we're talking about things that we may not see on the outside but yet a boundary exists inside the bible says in proverbs 4 23. i want this to be a a critical part of this subject keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it out of the heart are the issues of life we could just get uh deeper and i wanted to say lost but in a real positive way uh jack the other day said something was sick and i was like really and he goes yeah you know like dad in a good way though i'm like my seven-year-old saying something sick but in a good way though dad you got to get hip dad you got to figure out what we're talking about like i feel you i feel you keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life we could get lost in that whole subject how out of the heart are the issues of life but just can you see it that that phrase is very large out of the heart are all every all the issues of life where does god begin in dealing with us to accept his word your heart i mean it's just however you want to look at it what are we forming in our children as we raise them the heart what is it that we act from as adults the heart there's so much that's expressed to this for out of the heart of the issues of life so the bible says keep your heart with all diligence we can spend the rest of the service just on diligence but it says keep it means guard watch over keep blockaded put boundaries around your heart guard with fidelity keep from dangers we're actually told not to not to open up our hearts to harm and not open up our hearts to things that aren't righteous and open up our hearts to evil and say well you're a christian you should rip your chest cavity open and invite the spears like you're some sort of william wallace and take them all into you but you have the sense of no i've got to guard my heart i have to keep it from dangers first corinthians chapter 10 verse 13 i had had these in the slide last time and couldn't get to them there have no temptation taken you but such is common to man don't ever think you're going through something that somebody else hasn't gone through it may not have the specific uh details in terms of date time temperature zip code names faces blood relations whatever it might be but there is no temptation that has taken you that hasn't been common that is not common to man but god is faithful remember this phrase god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it can i paraphrase it god will not push you beyond your limit it says god is faithful so this is this is the attribute of characteristic of god god who is love is faithful and in his faithfulness he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear beyond what you can handle now notice that doesn't mean he doesn't allow something to come that would push you that would that would bring you to the brink but says that god as you would approach that he makes a way of escape you recognize that this is god's love he's very conscious and aware of limits he knows he knows your boundaries and he also knows your barriers he knows the things that you should not shrink from that there's ways that we have uh if you can think of it this way if we have uh promises that we want to possess we want to grow to a hundredfold there's things in the word of god that are we ought to ask god is scripturally to expand enlarge my heart expand my borders lord there's a way that we can live in our lives we've just retreated down to something very very small and we're not living in the fullness of the promises we're not advancing forward in possessing the promised land we're not seeing that our hearts are being enlarged and but we don't see necessarily any barriers you've just retreated you've just shrunk back and god oh your boundaries are also conscious of your barriers and so it says god is faithful who not suffer you he will not allow you he will not stuff you to be tempted above that you are able to bear there is a measure that god has determined he's determined to measure that god is faithful that there's a point at which he says now at this point here at this extent i'm giving you a a a relief i'm giving you a deliverance a way to escape and the way to escape we could envision it as you're being pressed in you're being pressed in and also there's a door that you could get out of it and there's there's nothing wrong with that analogy in the sense that just whatever it is to relieve you from this pressure looking as if it's going to push you and spill you over into harm or push you into something that is beyond what you're able to bear and and so the scripture says a way of escape that you may be able to bear it it means that you are you have power to bear up against it so it it the way of escape isn't always oh come here i come oh no oh no it's going to destroy me and it's going where'd it go where did it go it's all gone isn't that awesome it's all gone but you you come up and you're able to just submit yourself to the lord and resist the devil and you find yourself there with that power of resistance you find yourself there with power to bear up against it and so god permits temptation he allows the affliction but he also limits how far it can go he has a limit in other words he says i'm going to give you a way of escape power to bear up against it it can only go so far in acts chapter 15 verse 28 for it seemed good to the holy ghost and lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things and the establishment of the christian church and how the the gentiles are coming to the truth and mike could you imagine if you're a gentile like i got to catch up on all this judaism i got to keep all these different ordinances and all these different laws and there's one for everything and i've got to cut my beard a certain way and i've got to do this i got to do that i've got to wash pots and this and wash pots and that and i can't eat this and i can't there's a lot that's being expressed in this principle but he says we it seemed good to the holy ghost to not lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things so necessary things may be burdensome but we're not going to put anything more on you than what is necessary this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments though burdensome are not grievous and so there's something being expressed here where the holy ghost thought said it was good it seemed good to the holy ghost and they concurred in their spirits that they were not going to lay upon them anything greater than what was necessary because if it's beyond what's necessary it's a burden too great revelations chapter 2 verse 24. i know there's more to unpack in these but i want you just to see this phrasing will not suffer to be tempted above that which you're able to bear lay upon you no greater burden revelations 2 24 but i say but unto you i say and unto the rest in thy torah as many as have not this doctrine which have not known the depths of satan as they speak so this doctrine and knowing the depths is a certain understanding they have i will put upon you none other burden i will not place upon you no more affliction i will put on you no more tribulation i will not put upon you any more requirement beyond your reach you know this doctrine you know this depth of satan i will not require more of you than that in this age there's a there's a something being measured out and i i had these i had these scriptures to use at the beginning and i pushed them forward maybe to use next service that whatever but whatever judgment you judge you'll be judged with and there's great teaching that christ uses on judgment actually saying that in this age and this time this is the measure that i'm going to require of you and i won't require more there's there's certainly more right but this is i'm not going to put on you no greater burden no more affliction no more tribulation no more requirement beyond your reach beyond what you're able beyond what you understand i'm only going to judge you by what i've shown you what beautiful grace is being expressed in this i will not suffer you god has faith i won't suffer you to be tempted above that which you're able to bear i will place upon you no greater burn than is necessary i will put on you none other burden god recognizes thresholds god recognizes limits and if i can say this his love knows your limits just just allow your hearts to grab a hold of that this morning is i hope just to uh maybe catch some momentum and preach through this his love knows your limits and his love for you and his knowledge of your heart and who you are and what you can endure and what you can go through that is the protection that we must seek that is that is what we must submit to you're not submitting to this uh to these rules and regulations you're not submitting to an impersonal god you're not submitting to a dictator you're not submitting to a bro he's god's let's just serve him but it's a god that loves you and it's a god that you must that's the protection you must seek and that's what we must submit to it's a love that we so often fail to see in people who profess christ there's times in my life where all i wanted to see was christ no matter how it felt no matter what it was i just wanted to see christ and it's the worst feeling to not see it or feel it god recognized his limits in a genesis chapter 22 verse 14 we've used this a lot as a church the last few months there he is on the mount mount moriah and here's abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh what did god ask abraham to do take your son your only son isaac the fulfillment of all my prophecies to you and the culmination of all these decades of journey and kill him on the mountain and you know what abraham was able to do it because he's not going to tempt abraham beyond what he's able to bear he was not going to put abraham in a position where he's going to despair of his faith and abandon his faith and say oh no there's nothing to it i can't do this. and be protective of the program be protective of his own son be protective of the ideas but he could abandon himself to the cause of god believing you know what god gave me the promise he must be raising up isaac and i have confidence that god knows things and he sees things and he understands so he called that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of lord it shall be seen so it's not just jehovah jireh my provider but it's the god who sees it's the god who knows it's the god who knew what was abraham in abraham's heart it was a god who knew what it would take to bring these things out of abraham he knew abraham was there basking in the glory of the promise of isaac being fulfilled here he is in the flesh but knowing that abraham had one more step to take to come into perfect faith he had one more step to take to come into supreme faith and his faith to be made perfect and his love to be made perfect so god knew just exactly what him to put him through to where that next expression could unfold and so god was a god who sees so he knew not just abraham's limits in the sense that god the love love knows your limits and we say love has no limit so god knows your limits and what you're able to bear but he also knows just really how far you can go because maybe we just want well god you just have to see me as this limited frail weak deplorable person that i am who's bound by sin and lust and and god can say yeah i see that i see what you've been through i know your limits but i also know your potential i know your barriers to your potential love has limits we're talking about identifying a boundary that can be crossed or even barriers to fulfilling limits to filling up our expression but talking about looking at identifying things a line that can be crossed that spills into that greater burden unnecessary things that cause hurt and harm in 2nd corinthians chapter 2 verses 5 to 8 again if you could just recognize that there's this continuity with these things that paul wrote in first corinthians and second corinthians we've already read how the love of christ constrainteth us and i haven't really alluded to it i think most of you would recognize that paul had to deal with some pretty crazy stuff right in the corinthian church we don't have to talk about it this morning i'm speaking of family and um there's this paul has had to deal with it very bluntly this is the love of god acting but now as he's come through it he doesn't want there to be any confusion that love is just this this harsh thing that yeah i really i kicked his teeth in just i had to show him tough love but paul is recognizing uh these i as god recognized it and paul says love has constrained me i've got to act in a way that doesn't cause harm and not not gonna say that it wouldn't be offensive but that it wouldn't cause harm second corinthians chapter two verses five to eight but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me so i i'm not grieved he's he's wanting them to understand that he's not mad he's not angry he's not grieved part that i may not overcharge you all there's such grace being expressed in his language sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was afflicted of many so he's been afflicted he's been punished been dealt with severely so that contrary-wise you ought rather to forgive him and comfort him all right you've dealt with it but you ought to forgive him and comfort him sometimes we just want people who are wrong to stay wrong right they made a mistake you always want them to be bearing the curse they're wearing the scarlet letter of that mistake sufficient such a man is this punishment which was afflicted of many so that contrary wise you ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps oh it's so beautiful let's perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow but he deserves it right i mean seriously he deserves it wherefore i beseech you that you would confirm your love to him he's saying i'm not grieved if he have caused grief he hath not grieved me he has not grieved me i i am not uh mad at him i'm not angry i'm not i haven't crossed some personal i haven't reached the tipping point where i've just fed up pulling my hair out and he says that i may not overcharge which means to put a burden upon someone to load them up to be burdensome and it but it says to overcharge it means to burden beyond some limit and he wants to charge them but he doesn't want to overcharge them and notice how he says lest perhaps he says you ought to forgive him and comfort him forgive him comfort him as he opened up the very chapter with the comfort of god and whereby we're comforted one another and affliction in these things the theme is continuing he says that he should not perhaps such a one would be you have to act this way forgive and comfort unless perhaps such one should be swallowed up that means drown be devoured or destroyed with over much that means exceeding some measure you get it not that he would experience sorrow but he would be swallowed up devoured and destroyed by too much sorrow or something that exceeds the measure and the star means grief for heaviness so whenever you address the situation and we recognize this as parents that when we we were dealing with the child and addressing an offense we want them to feel sorrow we want them to feel remorse we want them to recognize that what they have done is hurtful or it's not right it's not appropriate they must feel that but what we don't want them to be take place is for them to be swallowed up or drowned with too much grief too much heaviness we don't want them to be broken we don't want them to be frustrated so there's a measure that you're wanting to bring them to in terms of sorrow and recognition of wrong recognition of offense but there's a point there's a limit because if you push it too far paul is saying he could be swallowed up drowned with too much grief too much heaviness like but he's wrong look what he did can you not see that this this deserves the harshest the severest severest the punishment punishment must fit the crime he said yeah then it can't go too far it doesn't mean that once once you've done this and then all is fair and the punishment so he says confirm your love you ought to rather forgive him and comfort him that you would confirm your love to them in other words enough is enough you've punished them enough you've ostracized them enough you've ridiculed them enough and may i know i'm putting words in paul's mouth but however you think you would deal with a situation like that in whatever self-righteous way that we would want to make ourselves feel better for not doing what he did however the politics were playing out in that church and however they might have played out in your life or how you would handle it yourself he's saying confirm your love in other words enough is enough now is the time to reinforce support now is the time to express love no more cold treatment no more gaslighting no more ghosting no more uh ostracizing no more manipulation or abuse or control uh but now is a time for him to understand that he has forgiven and he is loved and this is only appropriate after it has been addressed and and uh he says that there's a grief there there's a sorrow there he's acknowledged it and you look at what zeal and what enthusiasm he paul identifies the way it was handled so he says hey enough's enough and this is love manifested it's manifested in the same enough it's manifest in the way that paul is saying you know what maybe this no more now change and sufficient is his punishment and enough's been done i don't want to overcharge you all so i'm letting you know where i stand and you ought to also forgive him and comfort him don't let it exceed this boundary don't let it exceed this threshold no more paul is saying i'm very conscious of what this man's limits are and this is the line that you shouldn't cross now is the time to confirm your love towards them i hope that you've stayed with me to this point and you can see these things scripturally because i want to use another example so that we could recognize this god has designed our bodies and our spirit being three part being soul spirit body notice how even god has set boundaries and parameters to your person you're not just this malaise and mixture and this amalgamation of different things like what part is that well i'm not really sure where the soul is and where the spirit is where the body is we're just kind of these blobs right these free-floating shape-shifting lizards but we are uh we are carefully curated by god and designed by god and so god has designed our body and our spirit in such a way that it has limits outlets channels and you see where i could go with this to just be very precise the way that we define our body and our spirit now what i want to just zero in on very very precisely very in a very detailed way is how that god has designed both the spirit and the body with certain ways that it responds to things to indicate harm or to warn us of danger that's what the feeling of pain is in the body ooh don't touch that like don't let you set your hand on that any longer than that it's going to start uh burning up your skin so oh that's hot right oh don't do that or there's danger there's a sense of danger notice in our family that some of our children have a very robust sense of danger and if you put them in a precarious situation like whoa whoa whoa no and then another one just kind of takes to it like i like this feeling oh that's danger danger good right there's just if if there's a if there's a swimming pool i don't know how to swim but let me jump in it because that's what water is for if there's a if there's a ledge let me climb up to it if there's and it's just a different barometer different kind of sense of something but god gives us these things to to warn us of danger and the bible says to keep thy heart with all diligence it also tells us that our body is a temple and there's and this principle is so important and i want to mention it and hopefully come come to it later that we must we must and the word of god exist so that we protect our bodies and we protect our spirits like sanctification just isn't for the sake of being different right physical sanctification spiritual sanctification isn't just so we can be like the mormons got nothing on us right we there's a it's for it's for our ultimate protection and so the bible is telling us that it to the body is a temple and to guard our hearts it's saying that there are harms that we must avoid keep thy heart with all diligence keep away from dangers others some of you may have heard of dr gabor mate he wrote a book when the body says no i think in the united states the book was like something about stress and disease a correlation a connection to stress and disease but more globally it was the hidden cost of stress is the title of the book when the body says no the hidden cost of stress anybody heard this book before awesome okay i think my wife raised her hand nobody else so i'm not endorsing the book necessarily so don't go on amazon right now and have it delivered immediately it's coming in the door 12 copies for everyone to chat fact check me but the principle of this book is kind of one of the uh i want to express this in a very narrow way to under just make the point so this isn't gospel this is an analogy within the body that science um uh you know medical science is kind of looking at and recognizing very interesting swing in this this view but kind of the premises that our our body our immune system doesn't exist doesn't exist in isolation from our daily experience so you have an immune system and you can't just look at that uh as it's something of itself and like well this is the immune system that's the way it should operate this is how it should respond to something and kind of isolate it from what you're going through every day that's why people start getting sick and like well school just started right or this happened or that happened and there's certain things that take place i ever get the feeling you start getting a sore throat and what do you say i'm run down right there's something where you're kind of recognizing that my immune system exists within my daily experience my environment and the principle that's being expressed in this or some of the things that's uh being um introduced is how our body can become sick because we endure some excessive harm that there's there's some sort of violation that you go through it so much that eventually it's emotional and it's environmental but eventually it impacts your health and that's what this doctor's saying well we can't look at people's physical uh disabilities and their sicknesses and be like well let's just treat it clinically just based upon what we're looking at scientifically but maybe we should look at it in a broader sense of what's their what are the environmental factors what are the relationship factors what are the things you're going through there was uh and this is very personal but my wife was going through some very very terrible pain and i i hope it's okay it's your heart to say this but she actually thought she was going to diet and she got to so it was so severe that she began to worry am i going to die i'm a wife i'm a mother of young children where is this going to end because it was torment it was debilitating it was very very difficult and so specialist after specialist after specialist even went out of state went to places trying to figure out and every single one of them one after another said it's stress it's stress and then one day one of the doctors said are you in an abusive relationship and i said honey let me answer that question for you no she's not uh and she had to be honest about her situation and thankfully i was absolved i was vindicated i was not the abuser but she had to acknowledge that there were situations she was going through that were abusive emotionally and spiritually and so this is her body's responding to all these other things say well what's your dna what's your family history what's this what's that and they're trying to dig into it scientifically and these doctors are reckoning these are symptoms of stress these are symptoms of things that you're going through that are that are violating something internally and something's being upset and so it starts manifesting itself in the body so the body has a way of signaling hey enough the body has a way of saying this isn't right it doesn't feel good a limit has been reached so you're reaching some physical you could say in a physical sense like that that's hot avoid it or this is this is a dangerous place to be uh you're mentioning some physical threshold but then i want you look at the personal limitations right if you're running and you see something you got to get there and like i i'm not i can't jump over that right you say well i got to swim across this pond to get to the other side i can't do that that's a physical limitation so i'm going to go around it but what about the internal things you're reaching some threshold so the body starts telling you i don't think you can do that there's some people that just don't have that right think i can do it i bet i could jump to that rock how are you going to get back i'll worry about it when i get there right and they just feel like anything's possible in this physical sense but then there's this emotional side i want to use this as an example it's called the death zone for you mountain mountain climbers you immediately recognize this peak as k2 the savage mountain i hate to do that to you because i won't get an amen from those dozen people who said everest but this is the second highest mountain and they say it's actually the most difficult to climb but there's 14 peaks that are over 8 000 meters they're the 8 000 is what they're called for us and my fellow alpinist call them the 8 thousanders and there's a there's a zone above 8 000 meters that's called the death zone it's called the death zone because it's an altitude the specific altitude where oxygen pressure is insufficient to sustain life human life at this point you cannot live above this threshold sleeping becomes very difficult digesting food they say is nearly impossible the body is unable to acclimatize it means that once you reach go beyond this zone this line and that we're pretty much looking at it here in this k2 picture above 8 000 you can't you can't exist there long enough to the body to finally get used to it and actually climb this mountain k2 you actually have to be there for weeks ahead of time and there's base camp that's so so many thousand meters and there's another camp and you gradually work your way up over a process of weeks it actually takes seven days just to walk in to the base camp anybody want to go mountain climbing with me and there's uh the body you have to take time and your body has to get used to it and it's called acclimatizing and they're adapting to the elevation but then there's a point at which no you know what you you cannot acclimatize you can't spend weeks or days or whatever at that level your body's finding like oh you know what i don't need oxygen anymore we're going to be fine because the body uses oxygen quicker than it can be replenished and so there's a lot of people who use supplemental oxygen when they get above 8 000 meters there's also kind of this niche of people who do it without supplemental oxygen but they realize that in this zone the death zone the body begins to lose certain functions even the mind begins to deteriorate it's the same thing that can happen on the airplane with altitude sickness and the reason why they give you oxygen and you put it on the you put it on yourself first and then help others because you're going to start making wrong kind of judgments and and things are being misperceived and you can't you can't assess risk appropriately and there's so many things begin to break down in the body that ultimately leads to death either by the physical symptoms the lack of oxygen or poor decision making and they have what's called high-altitude cerebral edema i know you guys knew i was going there and you already had it in your notes the haze it's this brain swelling that begins to take place at this above this 8 000 meters and as the brain begins to swell and fluid begins to build and there's also one for the the lungs and the heart where the fluid builds up but this is in the mind i want to think of it in the mind where the mind begins to get disorientated it gets very lethargic gets nauseous well it sounds a lot like depression doesn't it that you come to this place there's so much pressure there's so many things swelling there's so much over burning and taxing because you begin to get disorientated you get lethargic you get nauseous it's all in this danger zone called the death zone you've gone past a certain altitude it's like no man is meant to live there you can perform a time and there can be something that's given to you and you even for a purpose back into the death zone to save other climbers and really kind of the rule is you have to fend for yourself you have to look out after yourself but there's some that will do it for a moment i'm doing it for the purpose of getting to the summit but i can't live here i may be able to exist for a moment but i can't go too far and so this is we're using these examples the body has a way of saying no enough's enough there's this death zone that we could look at in the natural how the human is not meant to live there there's not enough oxygen you cannot get used to it you cannot acclimatize you can't just get thicker skin and get to the place where it doesn't bother you anymore we must recognize the signals the body is sending before it's too late because there's always a price it's always a cost this is a statement from this book when the body says no to have the copies arrived did we have 30 minute prime delivery on that each of us must reclaim the autonomy we lost when we parted company with our ability to feel what was happening within we must take back this individual control uh uh the the take back our right to feel things when they're happening remember last year we ministered on the subject of being numb it was a bad place to be it says that lost capacity for physical and emotional self-awareness is at the root of much of the stress that chronically debilitates health and prepares the ground for disease really this is very very narrow uh i don't say narrow thinking but it's focused it's a very uh um very narrow focus on the cause of disease and and it's substantiated scientifically and i believe if anything it substantiated the message in terms of the factors that cause diseases brother brandon many times could tell that the disease you're experiencing now can be directly related to a stressor a trauma an event and so and even how brother of adam said they're finding that those who hold bitterness in their heart and resentment it leads to sicknesses and disease and then there's been a plethora of studies ever since then that has substantiated those who bear resentments and hurts and hold these things within have a greater or greater uh more subject to heart disease and heart failure and other diseases so i said that the to not be able to be aware of pain to not be able to be aware of hurts and harms and and to recognize stress that it debilitates our health and prepares the ground for other diseases he says we we can't lose that capacity i'm going to use another example of it's called hypoglycemia unawareness and i know it's a very big word but hypoglycemia unawareness is when the brain has trouble recognizing low blood sugar i think my well how in the world does that happen well because the reason what takes place is and hypoglycemic unawareness is the body doesn't trigger the early symptoms of low blood sugar because the body's like hey blood sugar's low and you might find yourself getting a little shaky a little are there anybody here that has low blood sugar you get kind of clammy you start sweating and you your body might start shaking a little bit you might begin to experience some nausea and all these things are kind of saying hey guess what your blood sugar is low i mean anybody going to get a witness there you go and uh and and we have it in our family in my extended family so something very uh very personally familiar with and i know just even the the trauma and the anxiety when you get a phone call and you don't recognize the number and you've something has happened because of low blood sugar it's something that can happen the body usually signals hey this is this is happening and that's happening and and it's telling you your blood sugar's low but hypoglycemia unawareness occurs because of repeated low blood sugar events it happens so frequently it happens so often that the body stops recognizing it or put another way it stops telling you it stops making you nauseous you don't get clammy anymore you don't begin to experience the symptoms and so your body's not saying hey buddy you need sugar you just pass out and nothing's happened to wake you out of sleep nothing's happened to alert you hey something's wrong i feel this has happened because over and over again you have not addressed the problem you do not you do not uh moderate and control and even through a dietary approach or whatever it might be the body constantly being afflicted with this trauma constantly enduring these low blood sugar levels finally stop sending the signal but the damage is still being done it's not like the body says hey you know what he's not paying attention no no low blood sugar anymore like i beat it i beat it oh you're gonna die one day the body sends the signal but if frequently ignored ignored the less the body gives the warning let's think let's think spiritually about this dr mate uses an example i believe it's in the first chapter of his book of a patient named mary with these very very difficult uh medical symptoms and things that were trying to be diagnosed and he took time with her one day and said tell me your whole story and begin to find out things about her childhood and things she went through and the kind of character kind of way she responded to things and the the abuses and even the um things that she was endured and he concluded with this he says i've often wondered many times how mary's life might have turned out and and i don't want you to get kind of lost in his verbage but just the principle i turned out if someone had been there to hear see and understand her when she was a small child abused frightened feeling responsible for her little sisters he says perhaps had someone been there consistently and dependably she could have learned to value herself to express her feelings he says to assert her anger and i think that that's that's uh to establishing a limit when people invaded her boundaries physically or emotionally he's saying i'm looking at this woman and she ultimately died he's saying man i wonder how things would have been different if she had been able to defend her boundaries if she had the kind of love and support and something had been consistent and dependable there'd been some kind of comfort there that would have taught her to value herself and then have an outlet for her feelings and to be able to assert her her her rights as a person to not be trespassed emotionally or physically this is a doctor kind of with this conjecture about the outcome of this person's life he said maybe everything that caused her to die physically ultimately could be traced back to her boundaries internally not some environmental toxin uh she worked in a factory breathed this in she got lung disease and she died not not well there was lead in the water not not a genetic factor well every you know all for generations they all died of pancreatic cancer no this is someone as a young girl began to endure things that led to sickness in the future the message teaches us this right this isn't foreign to us conclusion a direct statement when we have been prevented this is actually from an article that he wrote when we have been prevented from learning how to say no our bodies may end up saying it for us when you have been prevented from saying no your body starts saying it for you when you're not making the decision yourself when you're not exercising the discernment and the the right kind of con your body begins to tell you something's not right something's not right your spirit's being defiled you're a little bit edgy you're getting frustrated you're getting out you're having these outbursts think spiritually now we're not thinking about all of us trying to diagnose and google and find out we have cancer you're going to die we're talking about emotions and feelings and being circumspect and being uh having a soft answer turn away wrap we're talking about the character of christ being inhibited barriers to expressing the word of god in this hour and we have to recognize that maybe there's some threshold some limit some way that i need to scale back or i need to advance forward in when we have been prevented from saying no our bodies may be saying it for us we have we all have limits and we must recognize when limits are being reached we must recognize when something's being exceeded we must recognize when not just our body is saying no in a physical sense but when our heart is saying no it's not right i it doesn't feel right this isn't who i am this isn't what i want to experience it's i've been preaching now for an hour and i'm going to go into the hour after hour here as we arrive to our text but this is just going to be a very very direct line to our clothes and second corinthians chapter 1 verses to just read verses 8 to 10 paul experienced this trouble in like lystra where the persecution was so great and even physically how he was beset he thought they're going to kill me i'm dead i'm good as a dead man but they'll take my body and they'll throw it to the side put in a ditch buried in the grave but he knew what god had called him to see confidence in god's calling and so instead of trusting that he could escape the persecution figure out a way out he just knew that god would have to raise him from the dead that's a pretty remarkable way to look at this but this is exactly what he expresses for we would not brother and have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia and this is the phrase that i find so unique that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life i i don't often maybe use a language to express this but god came to me multiple times last week to confirm that when the body is saying no in this scripture and just put them together and in very personal ways for me to recognize this is the lord this is the lord you have liberty to use this uh very directly and that there'll be a grace for the people to not you know run out and buy the book and start living by some discipline or have some kind of new way of viewing things but just to bring it back to the word paul saying i want you to know i don't want you to be ignorant the fact that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life listen to the words of the first age first church age messenger we were pressed out of measure above strength we despaired of our lives but we had the sentence of death in ourselves we're going to die that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead it's to the point where it wasn't a god who would allow him to escape but a god remember this is the same one who wrote that god will not allow you to be tempted above that which you're able but with the temptation make a way of escape his situation was so dire he thought the way of escape was a resurrection but in a god which raiseth the dead beautiful phrase here in verse 10 beautiful beautiful make this apply on many different levels who delivered us from so great of death god delivered him from that physical death and then he testifies and deliver yet still the same yesterday and today in whom we trust he will yet deliver us three-dimensional deliverance full total complete perfect deliverance of soul spirit and body soul has been delivered from sin the body one day will be delivered into a new body and god wants to deliver your spirits also he says we were pressed out of measure burned beyond what he could bear he's saying i reached my limit this was more than i could handle he says above strength this is beyond my own strength paul is being open and admitting he was crossed he had crossed a threshold i said god will not allow you to be tempted above that which you're able beyond this measure be honest so as paul found himself crossing it he then turned his direction when it went beyond what he could handle he looked to god for the way of escape because he knew that god is not going to put me put me through something that's going to devour me destroy me he's telling the corinthian church enough enough don't do any more because you do not want this person to be devoured and swallowed up with over much sorrow paul i do not want you to be devoured with fear and trem tr a trepidation that you're going to be destroyed and there's going to be a loss of purpose and no value to your life he was going to give him some comfort to know that all things worked together for the good so then he began to look to god for deliverance because of the revelation that he had and i love it as paul wrote it he wasn't too proud to express his despair he said that we despaired even of life he said i'm destitute of measure i don't have anything else i'm hopeless i've got nothing and he's and he's he's being honest that he's despairing but he knew god's promise because though he recognized that he had his limits and he was pressed out of measure above strength to where he despaired he feels hopeless he had confidence that not only did he realize that he was crossing this threshold into despair but he knew that god knew his limits too just as this doctor expressed this thought about mary says what if she would have had somebody dependable somebody consistent who could guide somebody through their pain and their hurts what if she had somebody who could be there he knew that god knew his bounds he knew that god was an ever-present help in a time of trouble and paul was not too proud to say i despaired i i was reaching my limit i didn't know what to do i was hopeless but but i trusted in god you notice what paul didn't do everything's fine right i'm fine house is burning down got my coffee it's fine no paul's a house is on fire this coffee's horrible let's get out of here we're all gonna die paul was honest about it and i i want to say this it's very very pointed may god give me grace to say it i'll just say we're all guilty so we can take exception personally later we've become too good at positive thinking we've become so good at positive thinking this positive thinking to where we call all hurts good that's fine that's good this is good that's good and we start misusing scripture and promises and certain attributes and characteristics of a christian like well this is fine this is good that's okay and there's a positivity and i could put that in air quotes for those streaming that put it in air quotes where there's this positivity that can become a harmful coping mechanism it's it's not really this robust faith and i see the good and you're standing on this faith and and you're you're very strong and courageous this steadfastness where you can endure unto the end and you see these promises we just kind of get to this idea where it's positive thinking it's positive thinking disregard the hurt disregard the sorrow disregard the signals disregard the signs and what we don't realize is the negative emotions could be signaling that something isn't right there's been some hurt there's some big violation you're in a death zone get out of here and go oh no okay used to it and you think you're going to be fine brother you use this statement on wednesday night just and i'm not recasting a different light i'm just bringing it back up in the same way that he brought it out and the message how can i overcome he says you can't say i got a sickness and i don't believe it is a sickness there's a little bit of whiplash there you say well if you had cancer and didn't know it never have a negative testimony and so this idea we build this this sense of ignoring the symptoms ignoring the circumstances right and peter wasn't able to walk on water because he ignored the waves he just kept his eyes on christ and he knew i'm walking on a tumultuous sea he didn't envision it as glass i'm walking on ice he knew the he knew what was going on he felt it he could see it the billows and but he kept his eyes on christ and then when he started looking at the circumstances and the waves were saying but you can't walk on me that's scientifically impossible you're right so it's not ignoring the symptoms that's not faith that's not positive thinking that's not confessing the positive he says you can't say i got a sickness and i don't believe it is a sickness oh yes it is a sickness you got cancer i know this kind of flies in the face of our positive testimony our positive confession he says i you don't believe it is a cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember there's an acknowledgement there's a yes it's there i see it yes yes but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that's the positive testimony that's the positive thinking not that you trust in yourself and i'm going to will myself out of it there's really not there doctor you don't know what you're talking about whatever you can say i know that's what the chart says i know that's what the symptoms say i know that's what i've got but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world sister laura collins cannot be laying in her bed right now denying that she's sick she knows that she's sick but she can say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that is in you has already overcome this thing paul wasn't saying well i'm good enough i'm strong enough and when i come up against my limits i just dig down deep and get him guppy and i can overcome this no he's at that point says god there's got to be something greater than me there's got to be something beyond me these are my limits with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible i want to ask you this how many cancers have you dealt with and tried to defeat by ignoring them instead of using the word many cancers do we just live with how many toxic things how many abuses how many things are we just willing to live with by ignoring them and using positive thinking instead of using the word you can never defend your boundaries by crossing a line you can never defend against cancer by being a cancer yourself i think i mentioned it earlier you can't use love and kick somebody in the teeth you just perpetuate the cycle you cannot set your boundaries and violate somebody else's at the same time enough's enough i gotta say no but you cannot be doing it properly if you've now crossed somebody else's threshold now they may not recognize it and you may think they deserve a whole lot of abuse for what they've done to you or you might feel like this is enough's enough this is what i got to do but listen you have to first submit yourself to god you've established your parameters you you found your place of safety you're firmly rooted and planted in this then the divine love is projected and saying enough's enough and you just perpetuate the cycle if you then in the name of setting saying enough's enough you kind of do it with the fist instead of the heart we should never resort to offensiveness but we just look to god's word god's word will make a way of defense the way of escape the word is our protection the word is our defender the word is our healer it's a god that heals all your diseases body spirit he healed the sin disease right how many have had divine healing incredible testimonies of divine healing he heals the spirit too he heals the mind i want to use this last example in first kings chapter 19. and i i want to we had used this recently after elijah's challenge and his sacrifice and then after god you know there on mount carmel such an incredible vindication a showdown and after this this uh move of god elijah's running from jezebel and he's running for his life his bible says he went for his life he's running for his life he's the spirit of life and he's running and he comes to a place in verse four first kings chapter 19 verse four this is my my final scriptures and i just have a it's a couple statements i want to weave into this but he went in and his love knows your limits right we all have a threshold we we all have these things barriers that are holding us back and god knows them so he's not just going to just push you past it god wants to do it wants to deal with it what's the beauty of the crossing the red sea god could have just brought him through and got him over there and they would have lived every day looking to the horizon for pharaoh's chariots to come after him so god does it in such a way to where that enemy would drown and they would never fear him anymore if he built the bridge they could cross the bridge too it allowed them to survive and not let the enemy pursue him to the point where they could be overcome with the flood they'd always remember fair has got a great army they'll figure out a way around eventually they'll build the bridge they'll they'll come and get us but god had a way of bringing you to a place it has a way of bringing you to a place where your enemy was going to drown in the very thing you were afraid of and so here's elijah keep that in mind even this idea that if there could just be something there to guide you and comfort you and love you protect you elijah himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and he came and sat under a juniper tree and listened to the words and he requested for himself that he might die he's suicidal he doesn't want to live anymore instead it is enough now oh lord take away my life for i am not better than my father's he looked at who he was even what had been his family history whatever it might be however you want to look at it he says it's enough i can't go anymore i don't want to live anymore when he says it's enough he said it's more than i can handle and he's actually saying let me die how can i be on the mount carmel and now run for my life from jezebel and what what is what's this mixture of vindication and the presence of god and fire the slaying of false prophets and now look at me i'm no better than anyone else i'm running away scared i don't even want to live anymore and he says it's enough it's more than i can handle i ask you was elijah weak in faith with some deep weakness and his confidence exposed and ah elijah's a fraud look at him look at the way he's acting running from jezebel this proves he's just a neurotic this proved he's not really a problem this proves there's nothing to him look at what he's going through personally look what he's enduring so here he is suicidal under a juniper tree feeling sorry for himself wanting to die and we could think back about moses and how moses came to a place where the he's crying out to god and god says hey i gave you a promise why cries thou unto me speak to the people that they go forward so here's a situation a prophet i don't know what to do and all this pressure and everything and he goes to god he says oh and he's crying out to god and god says stop crying speak to the people go forward and this is moses in his time of despair moses in his time of i'm reaching a limit i don't know what to do and god says hey i gave you the word i made it very very clear why are you crying to me i speak to the people that they go forward and we can kind of say hey god sometimes wants to kick us when we're down you know and we want to afflict the comfort and there's this language you begin to use and we can create a template of tough love right kick him kick him around be tough be strong be a man come on be a christian and there's a way that we're trying to uh we're wanting people to be rugged and burly and kind of in your face this is what a believer do this is a christian you don't have enough faith to do this then you can't be a christian you all need to be baptized again to 2022. and all these things that we get bombarded with and bombarded with and god's looking at this situation he dealt with moses one way and said hey you know what quit crying speak and go forward but listen to what brother brahman says in the message why christ speak many times when we look at the scriptures in our own way of looking this is an important principle i recommend you listen to this sermon in july 1463 in our own way of thinking it seems very hard in our own way of thinking but if we study it a little while we find out that the all-wise god knows just what he's doing watch this and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man he knows him we don't he knew moses he knew his childhood he knew his upbringing he knew his training he knew his mistakes he knew his deserting and running into the wilderness he knew his coming back he knew he'd met him on a mountain he knew he'd equipped him to advance him he knew everything about moses so he knew where this man was built and where he was standing and he knew with moses he said stop crying speak and go forward he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man can you say that for yourself he knows what's really in you even if you don't see it he knows what's really in you and so notice how god deals with the gender the juniper tree oh lord take away my life i'm no better than my father's is it enough just let me die and god came by says you prophet you get up haven't i vindicated you enough did i not just prove myself on mount carmel is that the way that god responded why cry to me get up and go forward go shake your fist in the face of jezebel he said and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruce of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again gave him a little bit and then said why don't you lay down again and the angel lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat notice what the message is because the journey is too great for thee he knew with moses like stop crying speak to the people that go forward the journey is not too great i've done what i need to do you just need to at this moment speak the word and go forward and sometimes like oh speak the word speak the word speak the word third pool create them squirrels move those mountains and yes there's a place that god wants to bring us to where we our faith is loose to operate in that but some of us need first to rise and eat and be ministered to and nourished and to grow up and then maybe he needs to lay us down again to rest and heal a little while and then he comes to us to a second time to say arise and he because still the journey's too great for thee you still need more and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat not just the first time but even with the second i'm the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto horeb the mount of god that was god's response when he was looking at a man he knew what was in a man he knows him not from the intellectual side not from the side of looking a prophet on a mountain doing this and think about the way people view prophets and even brother branham and how we view one another sometimes we're only looking at from the intellectual side but god sees inside and the message if you could all just focus now i read this fast enough i'll finish this he said what hearst thou elijah he said i imagine there's ten thousand angels watching him sleep there's one assurance the believer has though the world turned him down yet god loves him the world may call you a holy roller they may call you a fanatic but if you're true to god there's one sure thing god loves you and his angels are encamped about those who fear him i'd imagine on every limb all around through the place were swarms of angels and god came down and he said my poor little tired servant he's so nervous and tore up he didn't know what to do i want to pick out the angel standing here that's got the softest hands where's your tough love now the angel with the softest hand elijah he's rugged he's burly he's wilderness man get the angel with the softest hands don't you scare him and walk over walk over and stroke his brow right easy and i want the best cook among you go up there and get all the vitamins you can find and put in his cornmeal the world's turned him down but i'm gonna treat him right he says bring forth the best that we got cook him a corn cake and set him down some water and this soft-handed angel went over and stroked the little servant of god on the brow remember if you've done your best god still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved elijah and i thought that was so beautiful with the elijah type that god's love for his bride in this end time is the same love that he has for elijah and elijah went from this place later on in this chapter and where did he find god god said go before the mountain then i'll meet you there he wasn't in the wind he wasn't in the earthquake he wasn't in the fire he was in the still small voice why the angel with the softest hands not the loudest voice not the boldest flavors but that was nourishing him and ministered to him he had been conditioned to know what god's love was like and he could recognize him in the still small voice he loves you just the same as he loved elijah if you think that what i've been expressing through these nine services that i'm gonna give you you know 12 rules to be able to defend yourself at thanksgiving and just give you rules to navigate difficult interpersonal relationships that would be the shallowest thing to express in these things is to get rid of all the barriers that are keeping us from open up every door to god and say i trust you completely here i am here's all of me and knowing that he's the one that we can trust when everybody else has let us down when everyone else who profess love and we ourselves who profess love and express it imperfectly and say that god i know that you love me and i can trust you it's a still small voice not something extravagant but perfectly sufficient he said i know he says he's expressed this love and what was it brother brahm said about job he knew that he loved god and god loved him so that's why he went through what he went through because he knew love had limits and that doesn't limit god it looses god god's not pushing us out in this you know behold i send you out in the midst of wolves good luck be wise as serpents harmless as doves what limits boundaries barriers it's the love of god to us i mentioned it in my prayer at the outset but with elijah when he's laying there paul despairing of life moses fearing the people elijah under the juniper tree suicidal even jesus despaired of life and you have this this moment we could say oh then what i'm seeing isn't the evidence of faith right we say where's faith now but it's not faith that's at issue it's love because the bible says that perfect love casteth out fear and that's not an indictment of our faith it's just in that moment when we are afraid what the bible say that when i am afraid i will trust in you and that moment when all hope is lost i will hope in you in that moment where i'm not sure where to turn and what to go through and though yes i have faith and yes i i believe in you but now i'm in a moment where i'm fearful i don't let the devil interpret the circumstances and that experience this listen fear is no evidence of anything faith alone is evidence if you have faith that's an evidence fear isn't inevitable we give too much weight to fear and we make fear the evidence of the lack of faith and the evidence of the of of having no faith but in the moment that we are afraid in the moment that we have fear it's then that god's perfect love can cast out fear and make us whole i want you in this moment now with your heads bowed taking it all letting it all accumulate together in your heart i have so much more that i would like to express on this subject but i feel that god has brought us to a point right now in our hearts to where we could we could take inventory of our lives and not in the sense that we would need to uh beat ourselves and make ourselves feel guilty and make ourselves feel uh sinful and unworthy but let the love of god be expressed to us to see the true value of ourselves in his eyes to recognize that he loves you just the same as he loved elijah and in the moment when we're looking around and expecting god to beat us and to chastise us and to rebuke us maybe you've been looking for the angel with the hardest backhand you've been looking for a god with the sword you've been looking for a a judgment a harshness a cruelty and god's wanting you to relent to the softest hands this may not be for everybody there may be some moses here today that just need to speak and go forward and i say with everything that's in me child of god speak and go forward but if you find yourself in your life under a juniper tree i say submit yourself to the soft hands of jehovah accept his forgiveness open up your heart to him i challenge anyone here now i admonish you i compel you as paul would even speak to those children and say i'm i'm now i'm directing you i'm asking you that you would act then i encourage you now to respond to his love today you know how he spoke to you [Music] you know what's in your heart with our heads bowed you're not on camera people aren't looking around but in sincerity today i'll just even bound my head in sincerity today if you want to know that love and feel that love if you need the healing that only his word can bring if you need the courage that elijah received to go in the strength of meat under the mount form i invite you to stand and say it's me today lord it's me today yielding to your love you say i relent lord i've resisted i've resisted i've strived and i've pushed and i've kicked against but today lord i give up i'm not running from you anymore [Music] i'm gonna give in lord heavenly father i'm done with my own devices i'm done with my own coping mechanisms done with the cycles i'm done with the excuses i'm done using barriers give up lord i'm all yours i'm all yours lord [Music] take me lord here i am i'm not afraid anymore i'm not afraid of where this word's going to take me i'm not afraid of the change in my theology i'm not afraid of the change in my circumstances i trust you lord [Music] and i realized father that i have gone through paces in my life and i've experienced things that create the wrong image of love and create scars and complexes and negative tendencies i see them expressed in my relationship with my wife i see it expressed in the interactions with my children but lord i recognize today that what it has done is it's brought a contrast for me of what love is and what it does and what love isn't and what it doesn't [Music] and i love you lord i love your love for me it's so pure it's so clean it's so right and i don't want to be afraid of anymore i don't want to i don't want to feel like i've got to do the protecting that i've got to do the healing that i've got to do the striving but take take my hand lord and lead me and guide me and give me the meat lord that i need in this moment that oh you're such a good cook lord why would i be afraid of what you want to feed me [Music] lord if i'm going to lodge under a juniper tree today then i i welcome the soft hands i won't shrink back i won't run and hide further out of reach into a cave or a juniper tree but i'll say lord i i need you every hour but if i'm a moses that's standing in the middle of an exodus that's had enough vindication enough turns enough cycles enough vindication to speak and go forward and let me not be a coward lord [Music] we can look at the word of god and sometimes take it to be very hard even your response to moses why christ thou unto me speak bow to the children that they would go forward and we could think that that's really hard but the principle of why christ speak lord is you know me you know me you know what i need lord you know what's best so i'll trust you lord [Music] and i i'm thankful that you will not allow me to endure without providing a way of escape a power to bear up against it you will place upon me no greater burden you will not burden me beyond what is necessary for this moment in this time bless your people all those that stood lord even now i just would invite everyone to stand together if you were not already standing we just unite together standing now and lord we pray that you [Music] so fill us with your love that's being projected into our souls that we too can project divine love bless your people today may there be real healing that transpires i pray lord now that not only would there be a healing of the hearts and minds of your people but that it would be manifested in the healing of the body that has been brought low by these things and likewise lord may it give life power to this body this church in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music]
