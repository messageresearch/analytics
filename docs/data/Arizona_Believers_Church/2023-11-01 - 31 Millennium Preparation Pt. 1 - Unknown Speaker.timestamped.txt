[0:00] title tonight is Millennium preparation
[0:02] Millennium preparation I I'm using that
[0:05] title because I wanted to um take in
[0:07] that idea of being prepared for the
[0:09] Millennium and a millennium preparation
[0:12] and that there's something about the
[0:14] Millennium that takes that goes through
[0:16] a process or something about the
[0:17] Millennium that stands for something and
[0:20] so this preparation is going to look at
[0:21] the preparation for the Earth but then
[0:23] also for us and so there's um a lot of
[0:26] types we're still draw wanting to draw
[0:27] from for ourselves as we've been looking
[0:30] at the sermon future home and I will be
[0:32] drawing a lot from the sermon future
[0:34] home tonight in that sermon brother B
[0:36] talks about the three-stage process for
[0:39] the Redemption of the Earth or the Plan
[0:41] of Redemption is in a three-stage
[0:43] process we could just say that in
[0:44] general a three-stage process for
[0:46] Redemption and just because Redemption
[0:49] is a three-stage process we don't just
[0:51] boil everything down to threes we
[0:53] realize that this uh uh Manifest this
[0:56] Redemption manifest in great ways in
[0:59] ways that are so
[1:00] uh far beyond our language in ways that
[1:02] we say well this is part of the Plan of
[1:04] Redemption and these are Redemption
[1:05] benefits and all the blessings and
[1:07] benefits of redemption are included
[1:10] through that sta three-stage process and
[1:12] we know that the Redemption of the earth
[1:14] brings forth a perfect and eternal
[1:17] Paradise that's what we've been reading
[1:18] about in Revelations 21 and there the
[1:21] Earth will be full of Glory it'll be
[1:22] full of light I have no need of the Sun
[1:24] in that City the lamb will be the light
[1:26] the glory of the Lord will be the light
[1:27] it'll be full of the knowledge of the
[1:29] Lord and that's describe in an eighth
[1:31] day a perfect condition and so we've
[1:33] been using as brother bradam does the
[1:35] Redemption of the earth to show a type
[1:37] of the work of the holy spirit in us
[1:39] right now as we see the Earth go through
[1:42] a three-stage process that final stage
[1:44] being burnt with fire brother brand type
[1:46] in that to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48] on your soul and we realize that the
[1:50] Earth is going through a process and
[1:52] will manifest something then my soul
[1:54] having already gone through that process
[1:57] then can manifest right now in this
[1:59] earth right now we can see that there's
[2:01] Redemption that's expressed and so our
[2:03] Redemption is
[2:05] multifaceted it go it comes to a
[2:07] three-part process uh to redeem the soul
[2:10] but then we have Redemption of the mind
[2:12] we have Redemption of the body and so
[2:14] there's a lot that goes to this
[2:15] Redemption a lot of types that you can
[2:17] use but at the end of the day we just
[2:18] say God's going to redeem us totally
[2:20] redeem us completely and as we mentioned
[2:23] before the purpose of the Holy Spirit
[2:24] right now is to expand the kingdom of
[2:26] God in our lives I have the holy ghost
[2:28] in my soul I I don't want it just to be
[2:30] a confession I don't want it just to be
[2:32] a mystery of faith alone but I want my
[2:34] faith to be shown by my works I want the
[2:36] fruits of the spirit in my life I want
[2:38] the power of God operating in not only
[2:40] way that I live by myself but in how I
[2:42] treat others and so the purpose of the
[2:44] Holy Ghost indwelling in your soul is
[2:46] that he can manifest himself through his
[2:49] people we looked at those scriptures of
[2:50] the knowledge of the Lord growing and
[2:52] increasing and just pushing out that's
[2:54] what uh that's what is at the heart of
[2:56] this taking the scripture the whole
[2:57] Earth shall be full the knowledge of the
[2:59] Lord and if we have the knowledge of God
[3:01] in our souls and we have the teacher
[3:02] inside teacher to teach us and we're
[3:04] calling upon God for Revelation more
[3:06] than anything then let it just keep
[3:07] pushing out pushing out and pushing out
[3:10] and that scripture we used to end the
[3:12] service last time in Proverbs 24:5 a
[3:14] wise man is strong yeah a man of
[3:16] knowledge increaseth strength knowledge
[3:19] is power is what we took from that some
[3:21] of the translations and so as we
[3:23] increase in the knowledge of God it
[3:25] looses our power as we increase in the
[3:27] revelation of Jesus Christ it manifest
[3:29] in power it manifests wisdom and
[3:31] righteousness and discernment and we
[3:33] want that in our lives our everyday
[3:35] lives now if you could look at verse 9
[3:37] and Isaiah chapter
[3:39] 11 and we'll go uh we'll start with this
[3:43] and then we're going to uh move quickly
[3:44] to Isaiah chapter 65 but I want to
[3:47] recapture some things that we've looked
[3:48] at on this it says they shall not hurt
[3:50] nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain
[3:52] we've read how the wolf and the lamb
[3:53] shall lie down together and and the cow
[3:56] and the bear feed together and the young
[3:58] one shall lie down together it's such an
[4:00] incredible thing a lion shall eat straw
[4:01] like an ox so it's describing this
[4:04] Millennial condition and it says they
[4:05] shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
[4:07] Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be
[4:09] full of the knowledge of the Lord as the
[4:11] waters cover the Sea full of his
[4:13] knowledge is full of his judgment full
[4:15] of his opinion full of his discernment
[4:17] and so if there's going to be uh the
[4:20] earth going to be full of his knowledge
[4:21] it's going to be reigned by a correct
[4:24] understanding of things there's going to
[4:26] be a a peace that Reigns there's going
[4:27] to be a righteousness that Reigns and
[4:29] it's coming through the knowledge of the
[4:31] Lord there's going to be a knowledge of
[4:32] the character of God there's going to be
[4:34] a submission to the character of God
[4:36] there's going to be an intimate
[4:37] understanding of God's will and I want
[4:39] you to put yourself in that relationship
[4:41] say that's going to be through me that I
[4:44] as a son or daughter of God on the earth
[4:46] I'm going to be full of the knowledge of
[4:47] God I'm going to be in his character I'm
[4:49] going to have the mind of Christ to know
[4:51] what he wants done with the word uh I'm
[4:53] going to there's going to be no chance
[4:55] for evil there's going to be no lying
[4:57] there's going to be no stealing there's
[4:58] going to be a reign of per perfect
[5:00] character and we know that all things
[5:02] unkind and Unholy and unhappy and and
[5:05] unrighteous and wicked stem from the
[5:07] lack of knowledge of God the knowledge
[5:09] of God stems from an ignorance we looked
[5:11] at the Perils of ignorance before as
[5:13] Hosea said my people are destroyed for
[5:15] the lack of knowledge so when Isaiah is
[5:18] describing this time of no unkindness
[5:20] and no selfishness and no destruction
[5:23] and no Wars and and peace he said the
[5:25] Earth's going to be full of the
[5:26] knowledge of God and I'm want us to make
[5:28] a direct connection
[5:30] that it's because the knowledge of the
[5:31] Lord has preeminence that all
[5:34] unrighteousness and everything else is
[5:36] vanished
[5:37] away and so this reign of righteousness
[5:40] that Isaiah is describing this reign of
[5:42] righteousness and peace it's in the
[5:45] Millennium what's being described here
[5:47] in Isaiah 11 is in the Millennium so
[5:49] it's not eternity or it's not the Eighth
[5:52] Day and the part that we've been
[5:54] emphasizing and building on is that
[5:58] there will be a kingdom
[6:00] and there is a king there will be a
[6:01] kingdom of power there will be a kingdom
[6:03] of knowledge we know in the eth day but
[6:05] as we see this type in scripture there
[6:07] will be a power of God in the bride
[6:10] there will be a knowledge of God in the
[6:12] earth there will be a a glory of God in
[6:14] the earth before the Earth full
[6:17] Redemption I just to spell it out
[6:19] plainly as I look at it that as the
[6:22] Earth is going to be full of the
[6:23] knowledge of God full of the light of
[6:25] God full of the glory of God and we see
[6:26] that this is a characteristic of the
[6:28] Earth in Revelations 21:22 and that's
[6:31] after the entire Earth is renovated and
[6:34] changed through the baptism of fire and
[6:37] I'm wanting to point this out that if
[6:38] that's what's going to transp transpire
[6:41] after the Earth's Redemption and before
[6:44] it's uh surface is changed then we in
[6:48] type can experience a growing and
[6:50] increase of the knowledge of God and the
[6:52] glory of God and the power of God in us
[6:54] now prior to our body change amen that
[6:57] there's a growing there's an increasing
[6:58] there's a rain of the Holy Spirit on our
[7:00] lives even before full Redemption even
[7:03] before the Millennium there's a there's
[7:05] a measure that we're to
[7:07] manifest and so I want to if you could
[7:09] turn to Isaiah chapter 65 I want to
[7:12] examine what this Millennial condition
[7:14] means to
[7:16] us and and to the Earth if I could say
[7:18] that and what it means to us now
[7:21] actually by looking at what it'll mean
[7:23] to the earth I want start with a Isaiah
[7:26] chap
[7:27] 65: 17 to2
[7:30] 5 he says for behold I create new
[7:33] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[7:36] shall not be remembered nor come into
[7:38] mine there's a lot that's a mouthful
[7:40] there's so much in that so much that we
[7:42] could think about the former shall not
[7:43] be remembered nor come into mine that
[7:45] that's a pretty uh heavy statement there
[7:47] but he says for behold I create new
[7:49] heavens and a new Earth I'm not going to
[7:51] get to it tonight I may reference it a
[7:53] little bit but I'm just kind of careful
[7:54] just how far I go how long I go tonight
[7:57] but we know that scripture can have
[7:59] compound meaning it can be conf
[8:01] fulfilled in compound ways we say see
[8:03] some scriptures that refer back to a
[8:05] historical event but yet it's
[8:06] prophesying of a future event we see
[8:08] some scriptures that are fulfilled
[8:10] literally to the Jews spiritually to the
[8:12] Gentiles we see some scriptures that can
[8:14] actually be fulfilled in one way
[8:15] fulfilled in another way so there going
[8:17] to be compound meaning and compound
[8:19] types to scriptures and as I read this
[8:21] there's two different ways you could
[8:23] look at it and and see that there is a
[8:25] fulfillment in one way and a greater
[8:27] fulfillment in another but verse 17
[8:30] refers plainly to a new heavens and a
[8:33] new Earth we know Revelations chap 21
[8:36] John says I saw a new Heaven and a new
[8:38] Earth second Peter 3 refers to the same
[8:40] that we're we're looking for a new
[8:42] Heaven and a new Earth where things will
[8:43] be changed and burnt up and so there is
[8:46] these references to a new world that has
[8:49] changed and as we took time to go
[8:51] through some of these scriptures we
[8:52] found out the change of the Earth was
[8:54] not a total Annihilation or an
[8:56] abandonment of the earth and a creation
[8:58] of a new Earth but it was the world that
[9:00] was being redeemed completely to be that
[9:03] place where the new city comes down out
[9:05] of Heaven from God and comes up out of
[9:07] the Earth or comes down to the Earth
[9:08] however you look at it and manifest on
[9:10] the earth for all eternity and that is a
[9:13] new Heaven and new earth and as it's
[9:15] described here I I created a new Heaven
[9:18] and new earth brother mam takes the
[9:20] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[9:21] and the Earthly bride he says so it's
[9:23] just a great Mountain as he describes
[9:24] that new city in Revelations 21 and uses
[9:27] second Peter chapter 3 to show us how
[9:28] it's formed like the pyramid and the
[9:31] city is on the mountain Glory there you
[9:33] are there is the paradise of God the
[9:36] light of the world that perfect Kingdom
[9:39] not the seventh day the Eternal one not
[9:42] the Millennium the new Earth now this is
[9:45] what he taught very plainly that this
[9:48] New Jerusalem and the new Heaven and new
[9:50] earth described in re Revelation 21 is
[9:53] the paradise of God it is that perfect
[9:55] Kingdom he says it's not the Millennium
[9:58] he calls it the a day so as we begin to
[10:01] read in verse 18 to verse 25 it begins
[10:03] to describe what we would refer to and
[10:05] what brother Brandon refers to as the
[10:08] Millennium or the kingdom age of the
[10:10] Millennium and not the Eternal perfect
[10:13] age now we could look at some of these
[10:15] scriptures and say well no doubt there
[10:17] are certain things that are going to be
[10:18] manifested in that time that will also
[10:20] be manifested in eternity you're going
[10:22] to be in a glorified body in the
[10:23] Millennium you're going to have a
[10:24] glorified body on the eth day there's
[10:26] going to be things that'll be true in
[10:27] the Millennium that will also be true
[10:29] throughout all eternity but there's also
[10:31] things here that we read that clearly
[10:33] point to a time which is end time and
[10:35] not eternity as I continue to read but
[10:38] be you glad and rejoice forever in that
[10:40] which I create for behold I create
[10:42] Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a
[10:45] joy now think of yourself in this think
[10:47] of types of the Bride think of what this
[10:49] Millennial Kingdom could be and what it
[10:50] foreshadows in eternity and I will
[10:53] rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my
[10:55] people and the voice of weeping shall be
[10:57] no more heard in her nor the voice of
[10:59] crying there shall be no more than an
[11:01] infant of days nor an old man that hath
[11:03] not fulfilled his days for the child
[11:05] shall die a 100 years old now catches
[11:08] our attention because it's talking about
[11:09] a child dying and that would catch our
[11:12] attention I think now that couldn't be
[11:14] uh after death is destroyed as we'll
[11:16] come to it in a little bit this is an
[11:18] this is a unique statement describing
[11:19] this and The Sinner being hundred years
[11:21] old shall be accursed special time
[11:24] special dispensation it's placed by the
[11:26] message of the hour in the Millennium
[11:27] and they shall build house and inhabit
[11:29] them they shall plant Vineyards and eat
[11:31] the fruit of them they shall not build
[11:33] and another inhabit they shall not plant
[11:34] and another eat which is their
[11:36] experience in the promised land as
[11:38] Israel's experience when they would
[11:40] plant crops the enemy would come and
[11:41] take it they'd build houses that they'd
[11:43] be overtaken and they'd be come
[11:45] strangers and driven to foreign lands
[11:46] they shall not plant another eat for as
[11:48] the day of the tree are the days of my
[11:50] people and my elect shall long enjoy the
[11:53] work of their hands they shall not labor
[11:55] in vain nor bring forth forth for
[11:57] trouble for they are the the seed of the
[11:59] Blessed of the Lord and their offspring
[12:01] with them and it shall come to pass that
[12:03] before they call I will answer and while
[12:05] they are yet speaking I will hear
[12:07] incredible descriptions the wolf and the
[12:09] lamb shall feed together and the lion
[12:11] shall eat straw like the bulock now we
[12:12] see some symmetry to Isaiah chap 11 and
[12:15] the dust shall be the Serpent's meat
[12:18] they shall not hurt nor destroy in all
[12:20] my Holy Mountain saith the Lord Brother
[12:24] Bram refers to this uh scripture in the
[12:26] sermon the future home and we're looking
[12:28] at how it also is using this in Isaiah
[12:30] 11:9 they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[12:32] all my Holy Mountain brother Bram takes
[12:35] this scripture and in future home he
[12:36] says speaking of the Millennium that
[12:38] thousand years of rest for the people of
[12:40] God As It said In Isaiah uh 11:10 and
[12:44] there the his rest shall be glorious
[12:46] this is described in a millennial time
[12:48] Millennial means a thousand years right
[12:50] we understand that a thousand year reign
[12:52] on the earth in Revelations
[12:55] 20:6 says blessed and holy is he that
[12:58] hath part heart in the first
[13:00] resurrection on such the second death
[13:02] hath no power but they shall be Priests
[13:05] of God and of Christ and shall reign
[13:07] with him a thousand years now if you
[13:10] could with me help me tonight uh just to
[13:12] minister this I know it's teaching and
[13:14] maybe uh more more kind of preaching
[13:17] Manner and preaching style uh kind of
[13:20] lends itself maybe to a little bit more
[13:21] response and so as you can help me
[13:22] tonight if it sounds familiar to you and
[13:25] and you can amen it just kind of
[13:26] encourage me a bit I know it'll help me
[13:28] but as we read this we recognize this
[13:30] very plainly that the second death hath
[13:32] no power over the blessed and holy and
[13:34] they shall be priest of God and of
[13:36] Christ and they shall reign with him a
[13:38] thousand years this thousand year reign
[13:40] is what we call the millennial Reign or
[13:42] the Millennium that's where we get the
[13:43] term thousand years from and this is a
[13:46] millennial reign of Christ the King and
[13:49] the bride the queen this is a special
[13:52] time for them uh for them upon Earth and
[13:55] God has a very specific purpose in it
[13:57] now if I could do something that that's
[13:58] very difficult for me summarize about 20
[14:01] services in just a few statements in the
[14:03] eighth day as we might call it I want to
[14:05] call that the Eternal Reign because
[14:07] there's going to be an eternal Reign we
[14:09] say a millennial Reign for a thousand
[14:10] years it doesn't mean he abcots his
[14:12] throne and we start all over and it's
[14:13] chaos again but there'll be an eternal
[14:15] rain and that Eternal rain we could call
[14:17] the Eighth Day brother brandom calls it
[14:19] our future home we could call it the
[14:22] perfect Eden the very thing that all
[14:24] things foreshadowed the thing that God
[14:27] are the fruits of all the seed that were
[14:29] swn it is the perfect Kingdom it is the
[14:31] perfect age Without End though we could
[14:35] say about the Millennium that there's a
[14:36] Perfection and there's something Sublime
[14:38] about it and there's a beauty in it but
[14:40] yet that is going to have an end in
[14:43] order to move on into that perfect day
[14:45] which is featured and expressed in that
[14:47] Eighth Day so that's an eternal Reign
[14:50] then the millennial reign as we read it
[14:52] here they shall be Priests of God and of
[14:54] Christ and shall reign with him a
[14:55] thousand years it's the seventh day in
[14:57] TI it is not the perfect Eden but a
[15:01] restored Eden you may be very familiar
[15:04] with this language but brother Bram
[15:05] calls it the honeymoon that Christ and
[15:07] his bride are going to spend a
[15:09] Thousand-Year honeymoon on Earth might
[15:11] see well that's kind of peculiar why
[15:12] would he do that well man we could save
[15:14] a lot of money if we could figure out
[15:16] why we have honeymoons and whether or
[15:17] not we need them it might be too late
[15:19] for some of us but maybe we could save
[15:21] the trouble for others but there's this
[15:23] honeymoon where Christ wants to spend a
[15:26] thousand years on the earth that was
[15:27] created for the purpose of getting a
[15:29] bride out of it the Earth that Adam had
[15:31] full demeaning and control over but yet
[15:33] did not live out the thousand years he
[15:35] wants to come back with his bride and
[15:37] live out that day that Adam and the
[15:39] woman never lived out and fully possess
[15:41] and Reign and manifest what could have
[15:43] been the full power and potential of the
[15:45] man and the woman in the garden and so
[15:47] it's going to be a honeymoon it's going
[15:48] to be a rest as God rested on the
[15:51] seventh day and while he took his rest
[15:53] is when Satan snuck in and caused the
[15:54] fall there is going to be a rest wherein
[15:56] there will be no fall during that f th
[15:59] years and what we must understand is
[16:01] it's called a thousand years it's still
[16:04] in time it's not eternity so it's
[16:07] distinctly different from the Eternal
[16:09] Reign
[16:11] right everybody with me so
[16:13] far I hope your ears aren't bleeding
[16:16] hope it's okay tonight now in the sermon
[16:18] the future home I'm going to read from
[16:20] several places and this is where I have
[16:22] a lot of lot of quotes to read and I
[16:25] just felt such a peace to be able to do
[16:27] it with you all knowing that you're you
[16:29] understand these things already and
[16:30] knowing that if there's anything that
[16:32] the Holy Spirit can do to place
[16:34] scripture more perfectly and place the
[16:36] word of God more perfectly it's always
[16:38] helpful to us we've been getting some
[16:40] good questions on these things and um
[16:42] I'm not going to quite be able to get to
[16:43] it tonight but a lot of people who know
[16:45] the message have heard things that have
[16:46] been taught and they read things in the
[16:48] seals and they they're piecing this
[16:50] picture together and as we've been going
[16:52] through this very very slowly a greater
[16:53] picture begins to develop there and some
[16:55] of us may realize oh I had this placed
[16:57] here but now I realize it's over here
[16:59] and oh I I hadn't even thought about
[17:01] that I didn't even think about those
[17:02] things so tonight if we share something
[17:04] you haven't thought about before just
[17:06] put it before the Lord I weigh it out in
[17:08] your heart and I know he'll give you
[17:09] understanding but some of these things
[17:11] if not all of them you've heard before
[17:13] but I want you just to take some time to
[17:15] see how brother bam places all these
[17:17] future
[17:18] events now in the sermon the future home
[17:20] he says now perfectly Noah was a type of
[17:22] those carried over I know there's a lot
[17:25] that we could express in this subject in
[17:27] these types he says remember when Noah
[17:29] came out ham was with them sin was still
[17:31] in there sin went right on over through
[17:33] the ark unbelief doubt went over in the
[17:35] ark carried over above the Judgment but
[17:38] Enoch went higher than the ark and he
[17:40] went on into the presence of God so now
[17:42] he's kind of tracking different types
[17:44] and so Enoch is a type of the Bride
[17:45] that's going to bypass tribulation now
[17:47] brother BR is identifying that after
[17:49] tribulation there's going to be the
[17:51] Earth and he's looking at a different
[17:53] kind of type he says but Noah went
[17:54] through and come out and there was still
[17:57] sin type of the Millennium of the
[17:59] world's condition I I would
[18:03] caution the urge sometimes to take the
[18:06] type and just keep expanding that and
[18:08] figure out the type instead of just
[18:09] looking at the what brother Ram's
[18:10] pointing to what he's wanting us to
[18:12] understand in the type is that well
[18:14] there's still going to be sin that's
[18:15] going to carry over that sin is not
[18:18] completely done away with he's wanting
[18:20] us to recognize how in this time of the
[18:22] Millennium it's a special time and that
[18:25] there's still sin uh to be dealt with
[18:27] later if I could put that way says the
[18:29] Millennium is not the end of it there
[18:31] will still be time after the Millennium
[18:33] the Millennium is a space of time but
[18:35] not the new Earth no indeed notice in
[18:38] that we'll get to it after a bit see the
[18:39] Earth redeemed goes back to its original
[18:41] owner again he took it from Satan he
[18:44] pulled taking the Earth away from Satan
[18:46] just like he took you away from Satan
[18:48] now that's is the parallel once again
[18:50] says like he took the little woman at
[18:52] the well away from Stan and this is in
[18:54] that sermon he uses that great principle
[18:56] of how when the seed is in you and and
[18:58] the word comes by something's flashing
[19:00] back something responds back there was
[19:02] no darkness in that woman at the Well's
[19:04] Soul so when the word came her way it
[19:06] redeemed her she was a redeemed
[19:07] attribute of God he said but yet the
[19:09] same thing manifested to the priest it
[19:11] reflected back Darkness that's what he
[19:13] teaches at that sermon so he says and
[19:15] they that little woman he took her away
[19:17] from Satan there stood the priest though
[19:19] he was with God he had nothing nothing
[19:22] reflected back now what a incredible
[19:24] type he's saying God's going to take
[19:26] back this Earth from Satan that this is
[19:28] the part of God taking it back just as
[19:30] he took you back from Satan those are
[19:32] those processes parallel and as he shows
[19:34] us but he says the Millennium the
[19:36] thousand years is not the end of all
[19:39] things if I could even say this if when
[19:42] he took you back from Satan it wasn't
[19:45] the end of
[19:46] everything and it wasn't the end of
[19:48] everything and you could just imagine
[19:50] what those things are but you realize it
[19:51] was the end of some things but maybe not
[19:53] the end of all things so there is
[19:55] there's this thing that happens it's
[19:57] permanent but yet there's this unfolding
[19:58] of other things uh not just temporal but
[20:01] leading out into great Glory now he
[20:03] takes it again so I want you to see that
[20:05] type of Noah because we want to come to
[20:06] it again he says this Millennium Reign
[20:08] the thousand years is not the new Earth
[20:10] the Millennium Reign is a different
[20:11] Reign that's what we go into the
[20:13] Millennium but that isn't the new Earth
[20:15] the new heaven no no that's just a
[20:17] resting place a rest period not all the
[20:21] new heavens and the new Earth not at all
[20:23] the new heavens and and Earth for you
[20:25] see in the Millennium we have things
[20:26] that we would not go into to that that
[20:29] would not go into that it's a type of
[20:31] the old seventh day out of Eden the
[20:33] seventh day after he made the world the
[20:34] seventh day he rested in Eden and the
[20:36] Millennium catching this how brother B's
[20:39] teaching this how that the millennial
[20:41] Reign is a different Reign from what
[20:43] he's calling the new Heaven and new
[20:44] earth through Revelations 21 completely
[20:46] different days the Millennium is a rest
[20:49] period not at all the new heavens and
[20:51] new earth and when he's saying that he's
[20:53] very specific about that final outcome
[20:55] in the third
[20:57] stage the seventh day he rested in Eden
[21:00] this is a type of the Millennium and he
[21:02] says there's things that would not go
[21:03] into that there's things that will not
[21:06] that would that still exist that won't
[21:09] go into that Eighth Day is what he's
[21:11] saying says and another place I think
[21:13] this is
[21:14] chronologically in the sermon notice not
[21:16] the perfect world this mum it's a type
[21:19] of the seventh day now catch the order
[21:22] then comes the white Throne judgment see
[21:24] we still have judgment so there's a
[21:27] perfect world rep presented after the
[21:28] baptism of fire in the 8th day
[21:31] Revelations 21 now in Revelations 20 we
[21:33] see they shall reign with him a thousand
[21:35] years a lot of these scriptures Isaiah
[21:36] 65 brother Brandon points out is
[21:38] describing a millennium a type of the
[21:40] seventh day and he said after that comes
[21:43] white Throne judgment he says we still
[21:44] have judgment so that puts scriptures in
[21:47] there that still have to be manifested
[21:49] this day of Judgment of
[21:51] God says we we're still in time in the
[21:54] lennium it's a day 10,000 years it's a
[21:57] time element no don't get that mixed up
[21:59] with the new Earth now cuz it's not you
[22:03] recognize again brother bradam showing
[22:05] that this new Earth that he is talking
[22:07] about in the scripture and in this
[22:09] sermon represents a very specific time
[22:12] but yet the Millennium represents a
[22:13] different time they all they're all
[22:15] working together these aren't competing
[22:16] ages now which one's better you think
[22:18] you think the Millennium the seventh day
[22:20] Seven's a pretty good number I mean it's
[22:21] not there's a debate between the seventh
[22:23] and the eighth they're Le one leading
[22:24] into the
[22:25] other now in question and answers part
[22:28] four and I realize this part may be a
[22:30] little bit backwards because I have I'm
[22:31] quoting from the evening question and
[22:33] answers and I'll quote from part three
[22:34] from the morning here in a moment this
[22:36] is the order brother B shows us the
[22:37] Millennium the white throne and then the
[22:40] new Earth so we see this here in 1964 he
[22:44] says the bride when she's taken from the
[22:45] church then the church age will cease
[22:48] leod deia goes into chaos now I would I
[22:51] would suggest just really chewing on
[22:53] that one really thinking about what kind
[22:56] of levels what what the Imp ation are
[22:58] when brother talks about this when the
[23:00] bride when she's taken from the church
[23:02] because there's a message to call her
[23:03] out of the church in this age so there's
[23:05] a lot of spiritual application here and
[23:07] then a very lot of literal things when
[23:09] the bride goes into Rapture leot deia
[23:11] goes into chaos the bride goes to glory
[23:13] these are just some orders that he's
[23:15] going through very quickly the
[23:16] tribulation period sets in upon the
[23:17] sleeping virgin for three and a half
[23:19] years while Israel is getting its
[23:20] prophecy then tribulation sets in upon
[23:22] Israel and then comes the battle of
[23:24] Armageddon which destroys all things so
[23:27] there's a destruction
[23:29] and then the bride returns back with the
[23:30] groom for a thousand years the
[23:32] millennial
[23:33] Reign after that comes the white Throne
[23:35] judgment after that comes the new
[23:37] Heavens A New Earth and the new city
[23:38] coming down from God out of Heaven
[23:40] eternity and time Blends together see
[23:43] how this is uh brother BR is just laying
[23:45] this out there's a lot of scriptures
[23:46] here there's a lot of things that uh
[23:48] maybe Merit a lot of time and a lot of
[23:50] study for some but this is Brother R giv
[23:53] us a quick overview of things that are
[23:54] going to transpire and we know that
[23:57] there's a message calling the bride out
[23:58] of Leo deia right now that you've heard
[24:01] you've heard from your theophany you're
[24:03] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[24:04] the son of man and that word your feet
[24:06] on is going to carry you to your unseen
[24:07] bridegroom and when this bride leaves
[24:10] the Earth there's no more purpose of the
[24:12] Holy Ghost because now full redemption's
[24:13] complete for the bride there's no more
[24:15] Holy Ghost left in the earth and
[24:16] tribulation sets in on all those that
[24:19] are left behind after this tribulation
[24:21] period brother talks about the battle of
[24:23] Armageddon this destruction of all
[24:25] things and then the bride returning back
[24:27] we we use it in Malachi in the uh in
[24:30] maybe next Wednesday night on how we'll
[24:32] return and walk on the ashes of the
[24:34] wicked so there's some destruction
[24:35] there's some chaos uh some judgment
[24:38] that's happening in the Earth but says
[24:40] they return back for a millennial Reign
[24:42] after that Reign is white Throne
[24:44] judgment then the new Heaven and new
[24:46] earth so you see brother Bram bringing
[24:48] these things out uh from future home
[24:50] which was just earlier that month now
[24:51] he's laying it out kind of bullet points
[24:53] there in the evening here of August 30
[24:56] 1964 he addresses it in the morning he
[24:58] says we got a thousand years after the
[25:00] church has gone home and comes back upon
[25:03] the Earth then time ceases in the new
[25:05] heavens and and new earth there's a lot
[25:07] of questions on well it's time over and
[25:09] where are we and what's happening
[25:11] and I know that there's there is a false
[25:14] teaching that said that claims are in
[25:16] the Millennium
[25:17] now and wow what a sad teaching I mean
[25:21] just what a what an absolutely sad
[25:23] teaching could you just imagine you
[25:25] thinking you're in the Millennium now
[25:26] you just go up to you know the line hey
[25:28] lion come here buddy right well guess
[25:30] what guess who's not eating straw yet
[25:33] there's a there's be huge disappointment
[25:35] to think that this is the Millennium
[25:36] that was prophesied but yet you could
[25:38] see how so much of what that Millennium
[25:41] represents has already begun in you as a
[25:44] believer in your soul and that that what
[25:47] that Kingdom represents and what's being
[25:48] transpired that there's almost this this
[25:50] moving along on these different tracks
[25:52] where there's a millennium rising up
[25:53] within you right now and then once this
[25:55] body is changed you know you're going to
[25:56] come right back and being a perfect body
[25:59] in a millennium on Earth living out a
[26:01] thousand years and yet you know then
[26:03] that the Earth is going to receive its
[26:04] baptism of fire and everything see
[26:05] everything just keeps spinning on
[26:07] Redemption to Redemption to Redemption
[26:09] to Redemption Perfection to Perfection
[26:10] to Perfection shining to that perfect
[26:12] day where the lamb will be the
[26:15] light so there's so there's these things
[26:17] that just keep unfolding while the
[26:19] thousand years after the church has gone
[26:20] home and comes back to the Earth then
[26:22] time ceases the new heavens and new
[26:24] earth now the Millennium is not the new
[26:26] heavens and new earth there will still
[26:27] be sin after the Millennium the
[26:30] Millennium is a type of Noah going in
[26:31] the ark and carried over and brought ham
[26:33] and them on the other side sin even come
[26:36] out of the Ark but Enoch the translated
[26:39] one was a type of the Bride that went up
[26:41] not the one that was carried over so sin
[26:43] will still be on the other side of the
[26:48] Millennium but not during the Millennium
[26:51] during the Millennium is
[26:53] peace but sin will be dealt with the
[26:55] other side of the Millennium and then
[26:57] time f Fades out so this full fading out
[27:00] of time is waiting it's waiting still
[27:03] yet for a second Resurrection even to
[27:06] where this first resurrection is
[27:09] encompassing and even this coming to the
[27:11] Lord we could even identify is
[27:12] encompassing this Millennial Reign even
[27:15] now as he makes reference to Noah in
[27:17] these different places and these
[27:19] types let's look at second Peter chapter
[27:21] 3: 6 and
[27:26] 7
[27:28] well I'm wishing I would have brought
[27:29] more notes tonight I just going pretty
[27:32] quick here so in second Peter chapter 3:
[27:36] 6 and 7 whereby the world that then was
[27:39] being overflowed with water perished so
[27:42] the world that then
[27:43] was is we use in type of the world that
[27:46] was before the
[27:49] flood but the heavens and the Earth
[27:52] which are now by the same word are kept
[27:54] in store reserved UND fire against the
[27:58] day of judgment and predition of ungodly
[28:00] men brother baham says there's still
[28:02] judgment we still have judgment we still
[28:04] have sin that will be dealt with on the
[28:05] other side of the Millennium so the
[28:08] Earth uh the the Heaven and Earth that
[28:10] are now are kept in store
[28:13] reserved under fire fire that's going to
[28:16] come on the day of judgment when there's
[28:18] judgment upon sin the predition of
[28:21] ungodly men that's going to be that
[28:23] baptism of fire that brother talks about
[28:25] that completely renovates the Earth and
[28:26] her whole Serv has changed and and it's
[28:28] changed entirely and completely
[28:30] representing what happens to your soul
[28:32] Peter is saying this is how the
[28:34] transformation happens he talk about the
[28:36] Earth melting with fervent heat and
[28:37] everything being changed Peter's
[28:39] identifying something here that there is
[28:42] going to be the the the world that is
[28:45] now is saved to be changed completely
[28:49] and he's identifying something about the
[28:51] new Heaven and new earth in Isaiah
[28:53] 65 and even elsewhere because we know
[28:56] that the Millennium represents here a
[29:00] perishing of the world that is because
[29:03] he says whereby the world that then was
[29:05] being overflowed with water perished but
[29:07] there's going to be a new Heaven and new
[29:08] earth wherein the Heaven and Earth now
[29:12] perish right you see those things in the
[29:15] scripture so this
[29:17] Millennium that is going to be ushered
[29:19] in as we read in Isaiah 65 represents a
[29:21] perishing of the world that is if I can
[29:24] say this there's a premillennial change
[29:28] as we read it that the new Heaven and
[29:30] Earth shall be passed away that word
[29:32] means to pass from one state to another
[29:34] talk about a regeneration and a renewal
[29:37] it's not taking the Earth it is and
[29:38] saying oh you're gone you're done and
[29:40] burn it up toward it completely uh
[29:43] dissipates and everything just gone it's
[29:46] no longer there and then God brings down
[29:48] a new Heaven A New Earth and creates a
[29:49] new Heaven A New Earth though we might
[29:51] read this and says oh I'm creating
[29:53] behold I created a new Heaven and a new
[29:54] Earth and and these things are passed
[29:56] away and these things are no more it's
[29:58] not a total annihilation of the earth we
[30:00] know that in the eth day but now I want
[30:02] you to recognize something about this
[30:03] Millennium that comes cuz brother B says
[30:05] there's going to be something that
[30:06] destroys all things and just as the
[30:10] Earth this parished world that emerges
[30:12] from the flood there's going to be a new
[30:15] Earth that's going to emerge for the
[30:19] Millennium can you catch that I I'll
[30:22] I'll maybe I'll take more time in the
[30:24] and kind of rearrange some things here
[30:26] on the Fly or just give some more
[30:28] emphasis later but this perished world
[30:30] that emerged After the flood is a type
[30:34] of even the Earth after the
[30:36] Millennium it's not the new Heaven and
[30:39] new earth but there's a change that
[30:41] takes
[30:45] place well I I think we can we'll be
[30:48] able to bring it to a spot I think
[30:49] that'll
[30:50] satisfy uh well it'll satisfy in two
[30:52] ways it give you enough to kind of lean
[30:54] towards but then maybe enough for you to
[30:56] think okay all right I I want to get
[30:58] into my Bible a little bit I want to
[30:59] read the message a little bit find out
[31:01] where brother Aaron's going so you can
[31:03] get in all the questions before I preach
[31:04] this again now let's go back to
[31:07] Revelations CH 20:
[31:13] 6 Peter brother bram's talking about how
[31:16] this after the Millennium is a type of
[31:19] the CH the Noah coming in after the
[31:22] flood and I and I recognize what he's
[31:24] saying there and maybe uh it would be
[31:26] nice if he expounded more on it but when
[31:30] we look at the scripture the Bible says
[31:32] the Earth
[31:33] perished but yet it just emerged
[31:36] differently after the
[31:38] water and now there is going to be an
[31:42] earth that emerges in the
[31:49] Millennium and it says blessed and holy
[31:51] is he that hath part in the First
[31:54] Resurrection on such the second death
[31:56] hath no power
[31:58] but they shall be preached of God and of
[32:00] Christ and shall reign with him a
[32:01] thousand
[32:02] years now we just looked at this aspect
[32:05] of the Thousand-Year Reign but
[32:07] notice what is emphasized here on such
[32:10] the second death hath no power the
[32:13] second death has no power over the
[32:15] blessed and
[32:16] holy it has no power over those that
[32:20] Reign catch this this is very important
[32:23] I believe just to catch this he says
[32:25] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[32:27] the first resurrection on such the
[32:29] second death hath no powers first
[32:31] resurrection is for a specific group of
[32:34] people prior to the Millennium right and
[32:36] it says that the second death has no
[32:38] power on them so it refers to a special
[32:41] class of people that will be doing the
[32:43] ruling and doing the reigning during the
[32:46] thousand years because it says they
[32:48] shall reign with him a thousand years
[32:49] they're not the ones being ruled not
[32:51] ones being reigned over they wouldn't
[32:53] represent any other class of people as
[32:55] the Bible says that the center of a 100
[32:57] will be accursed it it's not referring
[32:59] to uh any other class of people that we
[33:01] might imagine could be there anyone that
[33:03] comes across through the out of
[33:05] tribulation or anyone that's raised up
[33:07] to be judged him we're talking about a
[33:08] special class of people over which the
[33:10] second death has no power brother Bram
[33:14] says now the next thing left is the
[33:15] translation of the church so question
[33:18] and answers the return of Moses and
[33:20] Elijah that's where we see the
[33:22] tribulation the Millennium Reign upon
[33:23] the Earth with the bride and groom for a
[33:25] thousand years and then the judgment bar
[33:27] and then a total annihilation of sin
[33:30] it'll never be no more at that
[33:32] time now there is if you can think of
[33:35] that there's everything's going to be
[33:37] dealt with ultimately completely gone
[33:40] but there will be a class of people over
[33:42] which death has no power and since death
[33:46] has no power over that class of people
[33:49] this is a description blessed and holy
[33:51] are they which take part in this first
[33:53] resurrection they're bypassing
[33:54] tribulation they're bypassing this
[33:56] destruction C and they're going to come
[33:58] back with Christ upon the Earth and
[33:59] they're going to reign with him a
[34:01] thousand
[34:04] years it's the people who have part in
[34:07] the first
[34:09] resurrection now we are we're new
[34:11] creatures in Christ Jesus right the
[34:14] Bible says I created a new Heaven and a
[34:15] new Earth former is passed away we could
[34:19] see that in type speaking of the
[34:20] Revelation 21 there's some that even
[34:22] placed that scripture saying that's
[34:24] referring to Revelation 17 excuse me
[34:26] Isaiah 6517 is referring to Revelation
[34:29] 21 and then the preceding verses refer
[34:31] to the Millennium I can see that but I
[34:33] can also see in the word of God that
[34:35] there's going to be something that
[34:37] happens to the Earth that renovates it
[34:39] and changes it for the Millennium before
[34:43] its complete total
[34:44] change and the description of the people
[34:47] that will rule and Reign Over which the
[34:50] second death has no power to me is very
[34:52] important the Bible says in second
[34:54] Corinthians 5:1 17 therefore If any man
[34:57] be in Christ not in the Millennium not
[34:59] in the eth day but if any man be in
[35:01] Christ he is a new creature so you're a
[35:04] new creation old things are passed away
[35:09] behold how many
[35:12] things old things are passed away behold
[35:15] all things are become new Bible says all
[35:19] things became new now if you want to
[35:22] take issue with that I would caution you
[35:23] against it because I know that we might
[35:25] say I believe I'm a new creature in
[35:27] Christ old things have passed away and
[35:30] all things have become new but there's
[35:31] still a lot of things that ain't
[35:33] new there's a lot of things that keep
[35:35] transpiring there's a lot of things that
[35:37] I could say are just the same old same
[35:38] old over and over again and we can make
[35:40] that point in a lot of ways but yet the
[35:42] Bible says you're a new creature the
[35:44] Bible says old things are passed away
[35:46] the Bible says all things have become
[35:47] new why because there's something
[35:49] represented in the transformation of
[35:51] your soul to say that's Redemption of
[35:53] the person connected with eternity
[35:55] beyond the the time the curtain of time
[35:58] and all things have become new it's
[36:01] because there's been a perishing of one
[36:03] thing a re regeneration of another we
[36:05] have been
[36:07] recreated all things are new even before
[36:10] this
[36:11] change right behold all things have
[36:14] become new it didn't mean that we got a
[36:16] glorified body when we were born again
[36:18] but yet there's a
[36:20] newness behold all things are become
[36:23] new now in Revelations 20: 10 to
[36:27] 15 I want to look at
[36:31] this on such a second death have no
[36:36] power
[36:38] the as you could see yourself what God
[36:41] has done to you all things are new
[36:42] there's going to be a newness to the
[36:43] Earth even the
[36:45] Millennium that you can relate to now as
[36:47] a
[36:49] Believer because we have been made new
[36:51] creatures old things are passed away all
[36:53] things have become new it says and the
[36:55] devil that deceived them was cast into
[36:57] the lake of fire and brimstone where the
[36:59] Beast and false prophet are and shall be
[37:00] tormented day and night forever and ever
[37:03] now this is that span of time and I saw
[37:06] a great white Throne this is what
[37:07] brother B keeps telling us there's a
[37:08] millennial Reign on the earth bride and
[37:10] Grom for a thousand years then judgment
[37:11] bar we've read Le in at least three
[37:14] places where brother Bam's setting that
[37:16] up as the next thing so we see this
[37:17] scripturally here in the scripture and I
[37:19] saw a great white throne in him that sat
[37:20] on it for whose from whose face the
[37:22] earth and the heaven fled away where' it
[37:24] go right you said oh it's gone it's no
[37:28] more it's just it's it's symbolic it's
[37:30] typing something and there was found no
[37:32] place for them and I saw the dead small
[37:34] and great stand before God and the books
[37:36] were open and another book was open
[37:37] which is The Book of Life and the dead
[37:39] were judged out of those things which
[37:40] were written in the books according to
[37:42] their works and the Sea gave up the dead
[37:45] which were in it and death and Hell
[37:46] delivered up the dead which were in them
[37:47] and they were judged every man according
[37:48] to their Works White Throne judgment
[37:52] this is the place that everyone else
[37:53] will stand but those who came up in the
[37:55] first resurrection and death and hell
[37:57] were cast into the Lake of Fire this is
[38:00] the second
[38:01] death and whosoever was not WR found
[38:04] written in the Book of Life was cast
[38:05] into the Lake of
[38:07] Fire
[38:13] now I just feel like I need need some
[38:15] help
[38:18] tonight if I could I hope you're get
[38:21] getting this picture in your mind now
[38:23] white Throne judgment there's a lot of
[38:25] people who are judged and they're going
[38:27] to be cast you it says devil and then
[38:30] that deceive them is cast in a lake of
[38:31] fire and brimstone and then death and
[38:33] hell are cast in the Lake of Fire death
[38:36] and Hell or cast in the Lake of Fire and
[38:38] whoever was not found written in the
[38:40] Book of Life is cast in the Lake of Fire
[38:41] so hell goes there death goes there and
[38:45] it says this is the second death so
[38:48] there is this Spectre of the second
[38:50] death that looms over everyone who
[38:53] didn't take part in the first
[38:55] resurrection blessed and holy is he that
[38:57] hath part in the First Resurrection on
[38:59] such the second death hath no power so
[39:02] if any man be in Christ he has eternal
[39:05] life and shall never come into judgment
[39:08] has passed already from death into life
[39:11] the second death this judgment has no
[39:13] power over you death has no power over
[39:16] you you do not even go into a place of
[39:19] hell you do not even go into a place of
[39:21] death you have completely bypassed death
[39:25] amen I want you to think of this what it
[39:27] means to be born again by the baptism of
[39:29] the Holy Ghost there is a second death
[39:32] that's coming and you who have the
[39:33] Blessed Holy Ghost now have no fear of
[39:36] death amen and one day death itself is
[39:40] going to be cast into the Lake of Fire
[39:42] it's such a paradox that's going to be
[39:43] the second death because that's when
[39:45] death death is completely gone and done
[39:48] away with there'll be no such thing as
[39:49] death amen the Bible says in 1
[39:52] Corinthians 15:22 to
[39:55] 26 then come cometh the end when he
[39:58] shall have delivered up the kingdom of
[40:00] God even the father when he shall have
[40:03] put down all Rule and all authority and
[40:05] power for he must
[40:07] Reign till he hath put all enemies under
[40:10] his
[40:11] feet The Last Enemy that shall be
[40:13] destroyed is
[40:16] death now we could see
[40:18] clearly that The Last Enemy being
[40:21] destroyed the time that death is
[40:23] destroyed is in Revelations 20 right
[40:26] right and we can clearly see that death
[40:28] is going to be cast in Lake of Fire and
[40:31] death is going to be destroyed and The
[40:33] Last Enemy is going to be destroyed in
[40:35] this as scripture speaks of here the
[40:37] last enem to be destroyed is death but
[40:39] it says he must
[40:41] Reign until all enemies are put under
[40:44] his feet but where is his throne
[40:48] presently anybody want to answer here's
[40:51] your chance it's the heart of man it's
[40:52] in your heart there's his throne and
[40:55] there is where he reign s first and
[40:58] because he's reigning there first There
[41:00] Is No Death for you right there's death
[41:04] to this body we know but there's no
[41:06] death to the soul it cannot die but as
[41:08] he reigns in his bride it's going to
[41:10] come to a place where even in this very
[41:12] same chapter Paul's writing he says but
[41:15] one day mortality is going to be put on
[41:17] immortality one day death is going to be
[41:20] SW up in life in other words there's
[41:22] going to be a defeating of death in the
[41:24] bride today
[41:27] though there may be a time that death is
[41:29] cast in the Lake of Fire and death will
[41:30] be destroyed there is an advancement of
[41:33] the kingdom and the believer's life now
[41:35] that'll say death you can't even claim
[41:37] this body
[41:41] anymore I I know that there's a lot I
[41:44] just think the Holy Spirit can Quicken
[41:46] to you in
[41:47] this but this is the advancement of the
[41:50] Kingdom in your life now to where the
[41:54] death has already been defeated for
[41:58] you and that second Resurrection or the
[42:00] first resurrection death is already
[42:02] defeated it can't come and take
[42:07] you brother Brandon says in the sermon
[42:09] Shalom just a couple statements to close
[42:11] here there will be a
[42:15] millennium the old will be young there
[42:17] forever sickness will fade away and
[42:19] death will be no more they shall build
[42:22] houses they shall inhabit them they'll
[42:24] plant Vineyards and eat the fruit
[42:25] thereof they'll not plant and another
[42:27] inhabit his son take it his son will be
[42:29] living why him he will not plant and
[42:31] another eats die off and somebody else
[42:33] take it but he'll live
[42:37] here there is
[42:39] a people in the Millennium who will not
[42:42] die that's right they can't die have
[42:45] glorified
[42:47] bodies this is the bride's honeymoon
[42:50] it's her
[42:51] rest he says and the wolf and the lamb
[42:53] shall feed together the lion shall eat
[42:55] straw like the bulock and child shall
[42:57] lead them around there will be
[43:01] innocence there'll be nothing could hurt
[43:04] we'll be changed from what we are now to
[43:06] that glorious image of the Son of God
[43:07] which is Immortal years can never touch
[43:10] him age can never do anything to him
[43:12] he's the immortal Son of God so we
[43:15] know I hope I'm not going too fast so we
[43:18] know that we're at the end time we're at
[43:20] the
[43:22] junction all these things thoroughly
[43:25] identified so will it be identified
[43:27] again that's what caught my attention
[43:31] there's things that are being thoroughly
[43:32] identified now that'll be identified
[43:36] again there's things that we are be
[43:38] being thoroughly identified now that
[43:40] speak of this innocence to come on
[43:42] Millennium and there's things that will
[43:44] be identified in the Millennium that
[43:45] speak of the Innocence that'll be
[43:47] forever he says all things thoroughly
[43:50] identified so it will be identified
[43:53] again and he describes this incredible
[43:55] time time upon the
[43:58] Earth
[44:01] where I guess I said calling it a
[44:03] millennium is just a really good way to
[44:05] describe it to Bible readers right when
[44:07] I say a millennium we think of certain
[44:09] things and that should just strike us
[44:11] yes it's going to be a millennium it's
[44:12] going to be wonderful
[44:14] yes and all of this before the Earth
[44:18] takes its last change
[44:20] right all this before that final baptism
[44:23] of fire that renders it a fit place to
[44:26] live right for all
[44:30] eternity if that's so then I believe
[44:32] that we shouldn't make any excuses now
[44:35] amen for how we should not make excuses
[44:38] for not letting the Holy Ghost have
[44:40] preeminence right in our lives now if
[44:44] our musicians would come let me close on
[44:45] this statement the future home he says
[44:48] there you are there is the paradise of
[44:51] God the light of the world the perfect
[44:53] Kingdom not the seventh day the eternal
[44:55] etal one not the Millennium the new
[44:58] Earth and I'll just let this
[45:00] statement marinate for a while while
[45:03] it's going through the Millennium it's
[45:05] going through its sanctifying process
[45:07] but still must be burned
[45:11] right while the Millennium is being
[45:14] described as a sanctifying
[45:17] process who is on Earth at that
[45:20] time who is doing the ruling who is
[45:22] doing the reigning Christ and his bride
[45:25] on Earth Millennium and it becomes the
[45:27] Earth sanctifying
[45:29] process where the bride who has become
[45:32] one with the word is ruling and reigning
[45:35] upon the Earth even with sin still
[45:38] existing right even with the Spectre of
[45:40] future
[45:41] Wars even with the a future rebellion
[45:44] and a future Annihilation and judgment
[45:46] even with all that happening there's
[45:48] going to be a bride upon the Earth and
[45:50] glorified bodies in a perfect harmony
[45:52] with the Lord Jesus Christ and it's
[45:54] going to be called the Earth sanctifying
[45:56] process oh Hallelujah I'm so glad to
[45:59] know that the Holy Ghost ruling and re
[46:01] in my heart right now is still bringing
[46:03] my mind through a sanctifying process
[46:06] and that there still is a work of the
[46:08] Holy Ghost to do in my life right now
[46:10] and bringing my thoughts into his
[46:14] thoughts you say oh brother Aaron are we
[46:16] in the Millennium well
[46:19] no no we're not in the
[46:22] Millennium but right now the Holy Ghost
[46:24] Wants to Rule
[46:26] just like it's going to do for you in
[46:28] the
[46:29] Millennium so there's Millennium
[46:32] preparation even the Millennium itself
[46:35] is a
[46:36] preparation it's a fulfillment it's a
[46:38] preparation and next time we'll like to
[46:40] get into it a little bit more out of the
[46:42] seals and this purifying of the earth
[46:44] just so we can place it in the scripture
[46:45] place it in the message of the hour that
[46:48] this purifying of the earth that takes
[46:51] place to produce a time of the
[46:53] Millennium is a type of what the Holy
[46:56] Spirit the pillar fire is doing in us
[46:57] right now is that not what he's doing
[47:00] for us couldn't you believe that for
[47:02] yourself this holy ghost that you have
[47:04] you realize man I became a new creature
[47:06] all things became new and I've had
[47:08] battles I've had struggles I've had good
[47:11] times I've had bad times I've had my
[47:13] I've had my doubts I've had my I've had
[47:15] this happen and I've I've lost my temper
[47:17] I've done this and you realize we look
[47:19] back for decades now even and we see
[47:21] this trajectory and I realize Oh Lord
[47:23] You're wanting to do in me what you're
[47:25] going to to do for a thousand years on
[47:28] Earth bring into subjection all things
[47:32] unkind all things
[47:35] Unholy so brother Aon does that mean we
[47:37] have to live sinless
[47:38] Perfection
[47:40] no but would you want would you want to
[47:43] sin would you want to be
[47:46] imperfect I believe that we can in our
[47:48] hearts just yield to him say Lord I I
[47:50] want to come to
[47:51] you I want to seek you with my whole
[47:54] heart I don't want to stay stay the
[47:56] same I don't I don't want to ever say to
[47:59] God well God you just need to be happy
[48:00] with the way I do things I want to know
[48:03] that I have a heart that can
[48:04] change and yield to him in All Things
[48:08] Millennium preparation not just for the
[48:10] Earth but for you let's Avail ourselves
[48:13] to God's process I know there could be
[48:15] some uh negative slights sometimes on
[48:17] teaching or slights on training but you
[48:20] know brother brandham taught us that God
[48:22] trains his people he equips them we are
[48:26] in a training process now and say Lord
[48:29] just te keep teaching me Lord keep
[48:32] teaching me thank you for your time
[48:34] tonight just your attention your amens
[48:35] it's just wonderful to minister the word
[48:37] of God to you you could stand with me
[48:39] now
