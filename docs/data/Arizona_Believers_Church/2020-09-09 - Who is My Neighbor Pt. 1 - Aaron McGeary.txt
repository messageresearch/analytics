TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but luke chapter 10 verses 25 to 37 and we know it as the parable of the good samaritan and uh i'm wanting to draw uh from the question that is asked in this passage of scripture and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and he said un to him what is written in the law how read is thou and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbor jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed him leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he passed at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee which now of these three thinketh thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise let's bow our heads on a word of prayer as we pray we'd like to just remember brother ron spencer in prayer as we know he's been overcoming a battle with cancer but he's also uh been diagnosed with uh covet 19 and so some good news this afternoon he was released from the hospital and sent home with some medications and some things to monitor his breathing so we trust he's doing well sister connie also has had uh the the virus so let's just remember them in prayer as we bow our heads our gracious heavenly father we're so happy to be gathered to death together this evening lord we believe that we're gathered in your presence lord we believe that we've lifted up praises and worship to you and father as we stand here tonight reading from this book that we know is the infallible word of god that we know that is it is god breathed and it is god inspired we pray lord that you would come and take it now as only you can and break it to us lord as only you cam may make it alive to us by revelation but we commit it to you lord believing that there's truths in these just this one passage of scripture lord the exchange between jesus and this lawyer the the answer that is given by christ we know that there's such rich truths contained in it we know that it will put us in a closer walk with you or help us to be better bearers of your name so father we pray that you would open it up to us and give us strength and courage we pray lord we pray for brother ron spencer his church tonight his family that you would continue to strengthen them and heal them lord may you just deliver him from this pneumonia lord just take these symptoms of this virus father break them lord and shed them father take them away from him and just stay the virus lord from the remainder of his church that they might continue to serve you lord unabated lord without hindrance raise your servant up we pray lord as we commit him to you and just pray we join our voice with the thousands tonight lord who are praying for him praying for a healing lord a total healing we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated my title i'd like to give and in looking at this we're starting a subject of who is my neighbor and in looking at this subject i'd like to do it on uh on perhaps if the lord would lead us to do it on more than one service do it on wednesday nights and i find that wednesday nights affords you an opportunity maybe to go at a little bit different pace sometimes it could be what might be seen to be more teaching and i just when uh when the lord began to lead us in this path to start this work god anchored this subject in my heart of who is who is my neighbor and it's a question i think that each one of us can ask we may be able to ask it as a local church you can be asking it as an individual and there's such rich truths contained in the scripture in this subject and so this is just a foundational sermon in this subject some might look at it as the good samaritan some may look at it as a parable alone but it's something that a a dynamic conversation between christ and someone else that just unfolds a great picture in many different truths that i believe will be a strength to us and we've been looking at on sunday genesis chapter 1 verse 1 where it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and i've been pondering the beginning of a thing and how that brother branham said the way god starts that's the way god finishes so we know that god starts perfectly and he ends perfectly and some of us may be start out slow and we may start out stumbling and we kind of bumble our way through certain things but we could eventually get it right and when it comes to the end product there it finally looks good and that's maybe the way that we do things but god has a way of doing something where even if it doesn't look right to us the way god starts is the way god finishes and i was thinking of different principles that we find in the message and certain things that have been expressed many times to us in ministry how that if you're if you're trying to aim at a target if you're off just a little bit at your scope and your sight isn't lined up right then by the time you reach the target you're even further off than you were just even where the line of sight was and the sight and the scope and so as time goes on if you're off at the beginning if you're off at the start the further you go the more you vary from the course and just was thinking of those different things and different principles in the scripture and i could say that my inspiration is this the right foundation for arizona believers church to have the right kind of foundation brother braham says before you can ever get started right you got to get on the right foundation and it's a it's a wonderful opportunity when the lord does a new thing and he does something where it's not building upon something else or it's not continuing something else but god desires to do something new and to start from from the ground as it were and i think i'm learning not to say from nothing but the lord starting something and taking things and bringing things together it gives you an opportunity to make sure you're starting out on the right track that you're starting to write on on the right basis and for the right reasons and i want to read a couple statements to you from by brother branham there may be a couple lengthy statements but they they deal with this thought of starting out on the right foundation and brother branham says in the message fellowship by redemption and i'm believing that the day that we're living now the most essential thing that i could think of any minister speaking of is to get the people back to the general principles of the gospel coming back to a place now that might seem uh to some they might read that think oh well what about uh the the depth of the word or the open of the word i have to realize that the the open of the seals those aren't the things that brother branham begin with when his ministry started there's things that he preached for a number of years even if you go back where he he's commissioned in 1933 and you take everything that he would have preached up until we have his first recordings in 47 all the way up to 1963 the beginning of 63 those are all principles of the gospel upon which the open of the seals could settle upon so even in our own individual lives we are tasked as parents to teach our children the general principles of the gospel as a minister you continue to preach the general principles of the gospel because when they come to a new birth or you come to an understanding of the opening of the word these principles are necessary for everything to fit together and for the life of christ to be expressed and these general principles of the gospel they're always with us you're never going to mature beyond the general principles of the gospel if you lay a foundation of a house and then you build the house upon it if you want that house to stand you build it within the foundation you don't go beyond the foundation you don't exceed the the limits of the foundation you you're going to have a two-story house you need to have a two-story foundation if you're going to have a 3 000 square foot house and it's going to be single story you need to have a 3 000 square foot foundation so there's a foundation determines the scope of the building it determines that the height of the building and so we are never going to get away from the general principles of the gospel and brother branson says the most essential thing that he could think that a minister could speak on so he says he says for if you're not built upon the right foundation it's just it's no good what's the use of building upon a foundation that's already been condemned what would be the use of trying to paper and paint an old building that the government had condemned and that's what many people are trying to do today by reforming trying to reform we'll start a church and we'll turn a page and we'll do today he says and and we'll try to do a little different than we used to do you'll never get nowhere like that it's just foolish to even try you're just only wasting time you say well now i believe if i would just quit my line and stealing all those things are good and as good as they are you're still a million miles off of the road you've got to start back to the foundation so even things that in themselves may be good and efforts that might be scriptural or even pleasing to the lord in terms of the the the inspiration that's behind it the desire that's behind it he's saying it doesn't do any good if the foundation's not right got to come back to the right foundation you got to start back to the foundation you got to build a new place not patch up the old one it says build a brand new and you got to come back and start right this is this is instructive to us as individuals he says you can't just you can't just patch up an old place build a brand new one you got to come back and start right that's the reason you see so many faulty mistakes so many people indifferent people who profess christianity the reason why you see mistakes and you see people who confess christianity or profess christianity who are indifferent or they're lukewarm or they don't have overcoming lives it's because they're just trying to patch up something that's old and they don't look at some say i need to start all over not build upon my own ideas not build upon my own traditions and opinions of certain things but to come back down to start new to start start all over again and start on the right kind of foundation not build on a man's foundation not try to further a carnal legacy but come back start new start fresh start on the right foundation and brother brown is expressing this to an individual even expressing this in the way that hit the direction of these statements maybe even to a church or people wanting to do things right or have a revival it says it won't do you any good unless you're on the right foundation and this is instructive to us as we begin something you've got to have the right foundation if you want to see the lord bless something and the message to whom should we to whom would we go he says here some years ago i was standing up here in new york with brother berg we had passed by a building and there was a mammoth big building oh it was beautiful and the architect had taken so much pains with how he had built it and its class and when we got to the building the surprise it was just almost completely finished but had been left sitting there no one was occupying it and i said what's the matter but to this man i said what's the matter to this man that i was with i said what's wrong he said the building only served for one purpose the contractor was so interested in what he put in the building that he forgot to go deep enough to put it on the right foundation i think about that here's an architect this is someone who ought to have known better this is someone that conceived in their mind a beautiful building brother said it was beautiful he says my you look there was a mammoth big building it was beautiful and the architect had taken great pains as to how he built it but he was so interested in what was in the building and all the amenities and all the furnishings and all the nice trim and all the uh the the gingerbread trappings that would be in this house that he never thought about the foundation that would be resting on he says the contractor was so interested in what he was putting in the building that he forgot to go deep enough to put it on the right foundation so it was condemned and most any time that building would rock down no one will rent it nobody wants it no matter how pretty it is it wasn't placed on the right foundation so here's a principle to us to understand that no matter how much you could try to dress something up no matter how pretty you might want to make it look either on the outside or the inside it's got to have the right foundation or it won't succeed it's subject to fail at any time it's subject to topple over he says no one will rent it nobody wants it no matter how pretty it is he said brother sister may i say this in respects of jesus christ i don't care how good you go to church how well you dress what good neighbor you are unless you took time to dig down to that foundation of jesus christ and lay your hopes in that solid rock yonder your beautiful church buildings your robe choirs whatever which is fine but it'll rock down some of these days god will condemn it because it's not laid upon the rock christ jesus here he is identifying that the accoutrements of church the trappings of a church the great choirs a good song service all the things that could make a dynamic church service and all the things let's just be honest all the things that actually make us comfortable in church the things we enjoy about church he's saying those things are fine they're great they're wonderful but if you're not if it's not laid upon the rock christ jesus then it'll be condemned in the end now that doesn't mean that there's a clock that's ticking and we just anything that doesn't have the right foundation we just sit back and just say just watch any moment it's going to fall apart no there's things that are going to continue forever continue unabated continue seemingly flourishing things doing wonderfully but if you really want to succeed in christ if you really want to meet the mark and listen in this hour a goal of any church the goal of any individual should be to go in a rapture uh the the goal of the the the thrust of the message in this hour isn't just to perfect funeral services it's not to make us better uh able to deal with loss and to deal with the passing of a loved one but rather we are not living for a grave we're not living for a funeral we're actually living for a translation we are the people on earth today that are going to defeat death and that should be the drive and the ambition of a church and there's no way you're ever going to defeat death unless you're built upon christ the solid rock that's what david expresses in psalms 25 he's he says now will my head be lifted up above my enemies he says now he has set me up upon a rock he's expressing something that's upon that rock that you are able to defeat death it's upon that rock you can look above your enemies brother brown showing how in even in the natural things a contractor so interested in how beautiful the building was he never took time to make sure the foundation was done right he says he is the only foundation and he says in mexico city we had a great meeting where their little baby was brought back to life and there wasn't that great place where we were having the meeting and this is just continuing that statement he transitions to mexico city he said we're having the meeting one of the brothers take me the next day out to look the city over which is mexico city a beautiful place but what did i find when i got out there looking down over the city some of the most modern architecture i'd ever seen oh they want they went all together out but what it was they never dug down to find the right foundation a great percent of mexico city is either pitched forward the buildings are backwards or sideways they never went to the rock no matter how pretty the building looked it wasn't built solid on the rock and when you're starting out for god don't lay down on some false foundation don't lay down on emotions don't lay down on some creed but lay your life in the hands of that eternal foundation jesus christ that chief cornerstone then build from then on no matter how fast or how slow you got the right foundation so it doesn't matter how fast or how slow if the foundation's right the building is going to be sure build from then on lay upon him for he's the only foundation that's for has security but you are secured in jesus christ as long as you're in him you are safe from the storm he is the only foundation and in each one of these examples if you want to take even brother branham taught me how you've got to start back to the right foundation and you got to build a new place not patch up the old one you got to start brand new what is he saying you can't build upon just patch up something old because the foundation isn't right and there's a lot of times when people will do a remodel project they'll actually find a place and they don't really like maybe what was built but realize this is a good foundation they'll tear down the whole structure and continue to use the foundation but what good would it be to build upon improve something that was old and patch it up if the foundation's not right and so he uses these two examples in this sermon where there's a a building in new york and all these buildings in mexico city they say they didn't dig down deep enough they forgot to go deep enough to put on the right foundation they never dug down to find the right foundation and he's saying that there's an effort that has to be taken in the beginning to ensure the longevity of the structure and i i don't pretend to be a builder and i'm actually maybe the antithesis of a builder uh not that i'm a destroyer but i'm just not really a builder i'm not really handy at figuring those things out but you find in my limited knowledge you'll find that the greatest expense is often in the beginning of something whether it be in the engineering of the plans and the design of the structure and then when money begins to be spent there's there's a lot of work that goes into making sure that the dirt is level that the studies of the soil and it can handle the weight of this of the building and if certain things need to be done to the soil certain things to be done to the the land all for to ensure the longevity and the safety and the integrity of the structure and so sometimes the greatest expense in a building is in the foundation the foundation's connected with your plumbing it'll be connected with your with your electrical and you don't want to skimp on that and say wow man this this house is going to cost us a lot of money it's 180 000 to build it why am i putting 80 000 in the foundation couldn't we just skimp a little bit on the foundation and i can put more trim up or i can use a nicer brick i can have better appliances in there and you can say sure go for it but what are you going to have in a few years all those appliances and all the nice brick and all the nice trim it'll be popping it'll be settling to be sinking because you didn't want to spend the money in the beginning you didn't want to extend the effort in the beginning to dig down deep get the right foundation and those are the principles that brother branham is eliciting when he's talking about how something is built you've got to be on the right foundation and i i express that to you as as family this evening just to lay a foundation there you go how's that for uh for connecting that together just to lay a foundation for why why how the lord dealt with my heart on approach in this subject of who is my neighbor that there's it may it's it's i want to do it in the foundation in the beginning of this church so that there's certain principles that were built upon certain things that become a part of our dna certain that things that become a part of our prayer life and our vision so that we never lose sight of the purpose of the church that we never lose sight of the purpose of our experience with god and how god wants to use us and something that's very very real to me is how brother branham teaches in this hour that the bride is she is she is the ministry of the son of man she is expressing a manifest in the ministry of the son of man so the bride is going forth to serve him and in serving him she has a mission and a ministry to all the world and that we don't we don't gather in a church building just to insulate ourselves from others and we and we don't have a fellowship so that we can kind of come away in secret gatherings in a secret commune and it's all hushed and we don't ever let anybody know what we're doing but rather we gather in times like this to be strengthened so that we can be a light to the others that we come in contact with that we would have something burn in our hearts where there would be no shame in us recognizing maybe a hurting soul at work or we see somebody in our extended family that needs reaching out to it and we have something that we can offer them something that we can reach out to them to encourage them to strengthen them and they need to even be excited about inviting them to come to church and so if we want to look back at our text in luke chapter 10 my question is is taking it straight from this who is my neighbor now this this lesson that is expressed here it's it's uh it's part of that right foundation that i desire for this work and it says in verse 25 and we'll just start with this and again we're not going to probably get very far in the subject tonight but just laying these things in here to ponder them it says in luke chapter 10 verse 25 we'll read to verse 27 it says and behold a certain lawyer stood up my you got to watch those lawyers he says a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him so now it's it sets the scene that it's it's not merely someone who's sincere coming to him with the question in his heart but it it tells us that his motive in approaching christ is to tempt him and this scene is is is common when you read the gospels they were often looking for a way to trip up jesus to get him to say something wrong to rally the people against them to expose them as a fraud so this lawyer stands up and tempts him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and jesus responds with the question what is written in the law what readers thou what is it that's in the law that you read what's your you answered the question now you want to know how to inhere eternal life i'm going to bring you back to your foundation or your belief system what is it in the law that you read what is your understanding he answers and says in verse 27 thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself in other words love the lord thy god with all thy heart and love thy neighbor as thyself so the lawyer trying to jesus is saying what can i do to inherit eternal life jesus then kind of changes he takes control of the conversation and he gets the lawyer to begin to think about the law what he's taught in the law and what is it that he holds to and what does he think is the greatest and he says it's to love the lord with all your heart all your soul your strength all your mind and to love thy neighbor as thyself now his answer is it fits perfectly with the way that jesus also answers a similar question in matthew 19. so if you want to look at matthew chapter 19 verses 16 to 19. and notice this and behold one came and said to him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life and he said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments he saith unto him which now notice this is he's saying there's none good but god if you want to enter into life keep the commandments and this is this parallels with with the the lawyer that's tempting him this tempting lawyer who says what can i do to have eternal life he says what's written in the law what do you read in the law so he's bringing him to the commandments and then this this one who came unto him and said good master he says which of these commandments jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so now when jesus was dealing with a similar question he elicits these commandments and then he references how that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself then just turn to matthew chapter 22. so it's just going to be a few pages later there where you're looking now in matthew chapter 22 verses 34 to 40. again this is uh this is a similar subject matter that's being raised but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together now how did this happen they come to him they ask him a question jesus is able to answer the question in such a way to where it stuns them and again he did this over and over and over again where they come with the question and he's able to answer the question in such a way to where it it it foils their plan just as they came to them with they say well who should we pay tribute to and he said well show me the money and he said well whose inscription is that whose image is on that they said oh well it's caesar he said well give to caesar caesar's and he had such a way of answering these questions and then they ask him about the resurrection and he has a way to even answer them on the resurrection and he's one by one they come to him trying to tempt him trying to trip him up and he has a way of just each time answering with such wisdom and such authority to where they can't nail him down so now they the pharisees here that he put the sadducees to silence and they they're gathered together now people who are common enemies now are joining themselves together to fight against christ and isn't that something you see that happened all the time people who may be sworn enemies people who never get along watch god start doing something and pretty soon people start joining up and banding together to fight against god and fight against the truth and fight against the word because they find common ground in hating the truth they may hate each other but the common ground of hating truth will overcome a hatred for each other and they'll actually unite against the truth and that's what's happening here they gather together and verse 35 then one of them which was a lawyer here they go again my goodness one of them which is a lawyer asked him a question tempting him saying master which is the great commandment in the law and jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment now i i believe it's speculated in one place i think i'd read before one of the commentaries that this lawyer that comes from luke chapter 10 that he very he very well may have been repeating back what he knows jesus said but these are certain things that were rehearsed by the jews to one another this this commandment love the lord thy god with all the heart all thy soul and all thy mind he said this is the first and great commandment this is exactly what is expressed by the lawyer in luke chapter 10 who came to tempt him then verse 39 this is very very heavy and the second is like unto it so the first and great commandment is to love the lord thy god with all the heart soul and mind now that makes a lot of sense to us does anybody have a problem with that one that god's first commandment would be love me with all that you are all your soul all your strength all your mind love me with everything that you have with uh oh give me all that you are and we say that's that makes a lot of sense even if we wanted to attribute to god some false motive and and make him a deity among many if he had this desire this command that you were to love him with everything that would even meet a logical conclusion that someone would have that a deity would require so it's maybe not hard for anyone just to accept that god would want you to love him with everything that you are soul spirit body heart soul and mind but then he says the second one is like unto it so the second commandment is like the first commandment the first commandment being to love god the second one is similar to it and joined to it and we could look at it this way it flows from the first one he says thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself now this is a substantial saying this is something that we can't be dismissive of it's not something you just rationalize with he says the first one is to love god with all your soul all your heart all your mind and then it says the second one is like it love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets all the law all the prophets hang upon the commandment to love the lord thy god and to love thy neighbor as thyself that's what everything's rested upon that's what everything is connected to and tethered to is these these two commandments and in each one of these instances we've read in three places already in the gospels where loving thy neighbor as thyself is brought up by jesus and brought up by the jews as something that was very focal to their faith and they're drawing it from leviticus chapter 19. so i'd like to read this so you can have the context of it leviticus chapter 19 verses 11 to 18 he says ye shall not still neither deal falsely neither lie one to another and you shall not swear by my name falsely neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god i am the lord now these are principles that we would find that they have to do with decency and integrity when we even understand that these are things that would be prohibited criminally within our society within a decent society don't steal and don't deal falsely don't lie these are things that just basic uh dealings you shall not swear by my name falsely this relates to your attitude towards god and using the lord's name in vain not profane in the name of god i am the lord now notice from verse 13 on to verse 18 thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor neither rob him it would seem that it would be just maybe a given that you wouldn't do that so but yet it's still humans and their base nature they need to be told whatever you do don't rob your neighbor he says the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning so pay the wages timely give them don't withhold them thou shalt not curse the death nor put a stumbling block before the blind but shall fear thy god i am the lord you shall do no unrighteousness and judgment thou shalt not respect the person of the door nor honor the person of the mighty but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor thou shalt not go up go up thou shalt not go up and down as a tailbearer among thy people neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor i am the lord thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon him thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself i am the lord you can take and and i and i'm just laying these principles out there for you just to maybe digest to chew on a little bit and ponder them as i mentioned before we won't go very far in this tonight but it's just it's just identifying that when the law is given this principle of loving your neighbor as yourself became focal to it to the point where jesus can say that loving god with all your soul and all your heart and all your mind and loving your neighbors yourself that all the law and the prophets hang upon this rest upon this are built upon this i have continuity and consistency through this understanding it has its it has its uh its accomplishment or its success and these two commandments jesus expressed them when he gives all these commandments he comes back to love thy neighbor as thyself and if you look at this passage here in these several verses in leviticus 19 you find that if you can love your neighbor as yourself then you wouldn't rob him you wouldn't defraud him if you could love your neighbor as yourself you'd pay the wages and not withhold them to the morning that you would not put a stumbling block before the blind you would not you would not curse the death there are certain things that you would do that if you could love your neighbors you would love yourself then you would as the we would say do unto others as you would have them do unto you you wouldn't behave towards them in a way that you wouldn't want to be behaved towards so it serves even to kind of summarize maybe what god's trying to say he says i am the lord i am the lord i am the lord i'm trying to tell you how to act i'm not telling you how to treat one another so he says i let me say this but love thy neighbor as thyself and it just seems to kind of combine all these thoughts into one to realize yes this has to do with how i treat somebody that if i could love him as i love myself i wouldn't rob him i wouldn't defraud him i would even if i could love him as i love myself i would want to be corrective i would want to rebuke him and not not sin rest upon him there's certain ways that you would act towards them and so the the law brings the neighbor and your relationship to the neighbor into view and it makes it important that the individual just does not exist within a vacuum they don't exist in isolation that even their their pla to be pleasing before god and their relationship to god and even your success in the word is connected to relationships that aren't just your relationship to christ can you ponder that for a moment when we think about what what makes us a christian it's my personal experience with christ what is the new birth it is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you now once that relationship begins and once i'm on that foundation then the word is instructive and i begin to realize that i'm going to have relationships with other people that are not that are beyond maybe not beyond the word but that are connected with or are outside of my relationship with christ i have a relationship with christ but i can't just exist in a bubble and not meet with other people i cannot say well now that i'm a christian i'm going to divorce my wife and i'm going to move to idaho and i'm going to farm the land and i just want to be all by myself and i want to live as a hermit i want to i want to come away from all people all society all things and just live by myself you'd find that you couldn't live a christian life that way brother man says you cannot be a christian and stay at home you cannot be a christian and not go to church so there's certain things that were taught in the word of god that show that we must come together we must have relationships with other people and the dynamics of family and extended family it's all about relationship with others and we're seeing that in the bible in the old testament it was instructing them how to conduct themselves with other people even when the commandments were given the ten commandments in exodus 20 two of the ten deal directly with the neighbor exodus 20 16 and 17 thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor thou shalt not verse 17 thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbors god allowed one fifth of the ten commandments two of these two of the ten to stand for your attitude towards and your treatment of your neighbor and so this is when when this lawyer who's tempting jesus and and that's just a few things that we've mentioned in the old testament a few things we've referenced because we plan to go deeper into this subject of who is my neighbor but these are just things maybe to whet your appetite a little bit get you to think and ponder about this subject so when the lawyer answers jesus he says what's written the law what readest thou and he says thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul with all thy strength with all thy mind and love thy neighbor as thyself jesus responds to him in verse 28 and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live if you'll do this then this is this is the way to live this is how to have eternal life as he had answered previously you know keep the commandments if you'll enter into life keep the commandments so this is a way even if we wanted to try to wrestle with the paradox of how can i just keep the commandments and enter into eternal life he's showing this is the way to live this is the right kind of path to be on don't think that you can mistreat people and not love god and somehow find your way into eternal life but if you want to follow in truth if you want to walk in the light if you want to meet the the thresholds or or or to meet the mark for your age you've got to be loving god and loving your neighbor as yourself he says the house answered right this do and thou shalt live he's not reducing the commandment to be born again he's not taking it away he's not changing the formula of baptism and repentance he's just saying if you'll do these things this is the right way to live this is the right way the path to be in so now in this conversation he comes to him and he tempts them what shall i do to internally inherit eternal life jesus promised him what are you reading the law what do you what do you think is the most important he answers back of loving god and the neighbor is thyself jesus says that's a great answer but then notice verse 29 and this is where this is where the conversation begins to change and jesus is going to have to further take this lawyer to school he says but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbor now there may be different ways that through inflection we could express just accurately the attitude that this lawyer had but it does it's we know that it's not sincere because he says willing to justify himself we know that he approached him even with the wrong approach because he was tempting him and so jesus through his wisdom is asked a question and he's able to kind of turn the question back on the lawyer and and certainly in this day and age in terms of the lawyers then if nobody understands this the lawyers then didn't study the criminal code like we do today lawyers then are different than the lawyers now i'm not saying one's better than the other but the lawyers then studied the law the law is given to moses the law is given to them in the order ordinances and sacrifices so it was a it was a spiritual thing it was ordinance related to their religion and their duties as as as jews and the judaic law that was imposed upon them and the way to approach god and the way to treat one another way to judge and so that's what a lawyer was but in today's parlance a lawyer asking a question to tempt jesus and then jesus asked him a question and now he's the one giving the answers he really flipped the script on him because that's one thing you learn as a lawyer never negotiate against yourself so you always want to have the other person negotiate against themselves they said well i'll give you 500 for it well don't you just say well 500 that doesn't that's not really what i was really wanting to make i mean could you give a little bit more and then you get them to up the offer without coming down off your price that's called having making them negotiate against themselves and jesus has now caught this lawyer to where he's he's answered and jesus is the one telling it well then you you did good that's right just do this and you'll live so now i imagine his attitude is a little bit more sour and willing to justify himself he says to jesus and who is my neighbor just exactly then because now he's kind of caught a little bit he says and love thy neighbor as thyself well if you'll do that then you've answered right you shall live well then who's my neighbor and notice the bible says willing to justify himself he had the wrong motive he was wanting to appear blameless he was wanting maybe to vindicate himself he was wanting to set forth uh uh to to look as if he had the the upper hand that he was justified that he he was he was blameless in his activities but there's something there's some pressure that's coming down on him no doubt for him to respond and who is who is my neighbor we've already read in matthew 22 verse 35 where it says they they came to him tempting him this is something that happened very often they're going to tempt him with the coin with the tribute tempting with questions about the resurrection always trying to trip him up always trying to get him to give the wrong answer and so now once again this tempting lawyer asked this question yet willing to justify himself he says who is my neighbor and i want to emphasize this part here in the beginning of this subject because this part cannot be missed we could go to the parable of the good samaritan we could read that we could study it we could try to take from that we could even come to a satisfactory conclusion tonight just by reading it they come to the end and jesus says well then who was the neighbor to him that fell in the way so well the one that showed mercy upon him and we could be satisfied that we understand better a principle of christ we understand better the nature of the good samaritan and how we would aspire to be him but the the this part where the lawyer is saying who is my neighbor and he says it in a way to justify himself we cannot overlook the pres the beginning of this parable if we're going to understand the parable of the good samaritan if we're going to understand this parable that jesus uses to show us who our neighbor is we have to understand the basis of the lawyer's question when he asked he asked who is my neighbor he's the one that was asking the question who is my neighbor he was doing it for self-justification therefore the answer that jesus gives directly responds to that bias the lawyer asked with a certain thought in his mind he asked with the motive he asked with this with this uh some kind of bent to it and who is my neighbor and since he asked with this motive he comes to him tempting him since he asked willing to justify himself jesus in order to give the correct answer has to address this motive that's in his heart jesus has to answer in such a way to where it attacks that bias it attacks that selfishness it attacks that self-justification and it'll it'll take it away from him and say at least expose him and have him uh wrestle with the truth of who really is your neighbor and this is it takes place in the message in a few places i could think of offhand where brother branham's asked a question and you find that the way that brother branham answers the question initially to us may not seem like the right answer when he's asked the question do all born-again believers go in the rapture well you take the message from 47 to 65 and you can definitively prove that only born-again believers go in the rapture but yet now brother brahms answering the question in such a way towards like well wait a minute he says no only those that have the holy ghost and then when you realize that brother branham was often dealing with terminology and that this person that was asking the question must have had this in their mind that you could be born again without the holy ghost that you just accept christ it's like a i'm just born again i've accepted christ as my savior maybe a baptist understanding of salvation and so had brother branham answered the question right according to our theology according to the way that we understood the question he would have actually given the wrong answer to the individual who asked it so if we could even use it in this way the person who asked brother adam do all born again believers go in the rapture brother branham may have understood that he had a different understanding what born again meant so he had to orient him to to the fact that you have to be quickened by the holy ghost baptized at the holy ghost only those who have the holy ghost are going to go in the rapture and he's able to kind of correct this person's understanding and not give him the wrong answer so when this lawyer asked christ well who's my neighbor christ sees this bias in his heart this judgment or this deficiency that's in his heart and this motive that he has and his answer is going to address whatever's lacking in his heart and i think it's evident by the way that jesus answers that this lawyer probably had a narrow definition of what a neighbor was that to him immediately when he says and who is my neighbor he might have just been thinking of his history all of his bias and all his prejudice and all his discrimination his attitude towards the gentiles attitude towards maybe even the samaritan he might have hated samaritans he he might have had a bumper sticker on his cart rid judea of all samaritans and build that wall or something like that and he might have just it might have had a political platform and jesus just knew oh i'm going to get this guy i'm going to tell him a parable that's going to really hit him in his bias hit him right there in his prejudice and it's more than likely because he was a lawyer a student of the of the the judaic law he would have had a narrow definition that a neighbor was a jew and a jew only and think about this that's exactly how a lot of these jews perceived the law this is exactly how these jews would have perceived when the bible says love thy neighbor as thyself they would have said well my neighbor is my fellow jew and that would make it a lot easier and and he did it now he did it as a means to self-justify so self-justification was his motive so he wants to have this narrow definition of who who a a jew excuse me who a neighbor is so that he can be justified in his conduct he can be justified in his attitude he could be justified in his behavior and his judgments of others now make this very personal how easy would it be for us to make categories of people so that we can be justified in the way that we talk about them the way that we treat them and the way that we would avoid them the way that we would harm them whatever it might be and say well i i kind of ripped him off he's he's an unbeliever anyways oh my boss is rich he will never know that it's gone and besides he's not even a christian he doesn't even pay tithes this is just my way of getting the tithes in the right bucket my boss doesn't pay ties so i can skip i could do a little here and a little there how often are we able to judge somebody place him in a category and because we've placed him in another category we feel justified and vindicated in our attitudes towards them because they don't believe what we believe they don't live the same standard that we live they don't they don't told the line that maybe we think they should they don't look the part and so we're able to have attitudes towards them and treat them certain ways and so self-justification was his motive and i just want to take a few moments and this is a very very robust and a wonderful subject to explore in greater detail but self-justification is a very very nasty thing because when you this mechanism and all of us have it so at this point don't put your pencil down and be like yeah i want to see him rake that person over the coals no you're you're you're included too we all have it some are just better than others [Music] i i i there's my i came across a piece of paper when we were moving we found uh i found a little notepad that my high school one of my high school english teachers had given me it says everyone's entitled to my opinion and i think i had another one that said opinions are like noses and and the punchline to that is everybody has one and so i just added mine and mine are just bigger than yours because opinions are like noses i think maybe that that stands stands out on its own but self-justification makes it difficult if not impossible to say i'm wrong self-justification is so powerful that when you have offended somebody or done something wrong it makes it virtually it makes it very very difficult if not impossible to say i'm sorry i made a mistake and self-justification would work in such a way to where i could do something to offend brother john and i could recognize oh that was harsh that didn't seem right and and maybe i shouldn't have said that but self-justification would start to say but you know what he probably deserved it or you know what he's just reaping what he sowed right and we start thinking about scenarios in our minds to make ourselves feel better about what we said or what we did and we self-justify and if i engage in that kind of thought process then i'm probably not going to say you know what i'm really sorry i shouldn't have done that i've justified myself i'm the bearer of god's judgment or all you know really wasn't that bad he just needs thicker skin and self-justification will make it very very hard if not impossible for you to go to somebody and say i'm sorry i made a mistake now that may be very very damaging in our relationship to one another but there's a relationship with christ that when self-justification begins to work and you can't repent it will be impossible to grow in him be impossible to go any further and some people are living at this behind a wall or burial prison of their self-justification having offended or made mistakes or done things wrong years ago because of but with because of an unwillingness to just say i'm sorry i made a mistake even to god to repent to christ they're going to live in a prison of their own self-justification i read a book one time and it was i believe the title was mistakes were made but not by me and that's just maybe a perfect autobiography for all of us and if i remember correctly this is where i found these statements just listen to how the scientists or the uh the behavioral economics would address the way someone would be thinking and acting and how they've identified this bias within a human says as fallible human beings all of us share the impulse to justify ourselves and to avoid taking responsibility for any actions that turn out to be harmful or immoral all of us have this so jack one of the youngest here has this impulse in his heart all of the all the young children that are here today they have this impulse from birth and all of us as adults and young husbands and and whether it be grandparents whatever stage you are in life we all as human beings fallible human beings amen fallible folly who means we all share the same impulse to justify ourselves it's an instinct it's an impulse and to avoid taking responsibility for any actions that turn out to be harmful or immoral and then they they examine these different instances of corporate greed and corruption and different things and you find sometimes that somebody would do something you're like that person was really an upright guy you never would have thought they would end it up that way and how does a man of that integrity and how does a person who seem to be so honest and that decent person how does he end up in corruption and and moral decay so they ask the question how do you get an honest man to lose his ethical compass how do you get an honest man to to begin to vary from what he knows is right he says they say this you get him to take one step at a time and self-justification will do the rest how does how does someone become corrupt how does someone become immoral how does someone become hardened and perverse all it takes is one step at a time and as they self-justify they're never able to remedy they're never able to correct they're never able to come back and say you know what i shouldn't have done that they self-justify and say you know what it was okay for me to do that look what it produced or you know what i know maybe i cut a little bit on this but you know what i did it for this and as they make excuses and self-justified they get caught up and it just snowballs and they're saying that self-justification will do the rest just vary just a little bit and self-justification will do the rest they say mindless self-justification like quicksand can draw us deeper into disaster it blocks our ability to even see our errors let alone correct them self-justification will blind you to your own heirs let alone being able to correct them you won't even be able to see them it distorts reality keeping us from getting all the information we need and assessing issues clearly this is very instructive just to our interpersonal relationships the dynamics and family our dynamics with fringe uh with whether it be friends or employers employees this this mechanism this human mechanism of self-justification is destructive and when one engages in this this uh self-justification when you've done something wrong and you instinctively they call it mindless self-justification they say it draws you deeper into disaster it blocks you from seeing your air so it blocks you from correcting your air so that when you've done something wrong if if a message comes and i want to call it truth because if you've done wrong truth or right is what's going to expose your error so when light comes to show that you've done something wrong if you engage in self-justification truth becomes your enemy and think about that you're in air and there's truth that's trying to make you right but self-justification turns a truth into your enemy and so you actually begin to fight against truth when it tries to correct you and the very truth becomes your enemy you're in denial you don't want to believe it's true you begin to engage in self-justification and you'll actually have a way of thinking through something rationalizing and building support for it till you can finally take a truth and turn it into a lie and be justified in doing it that's very very dangerous thought process it's a very dangerous human instinct human impulse as they placed it as fallible human beings we all have this impulse to justify ourselves and this is the very impulse that was it may be instinctively welled up within this lawyer when maybe he's feeling somewhat exposed and jesus says well hey if you're doing all that then you're doing well you'll live you'll live right you'll live into life thou shalt live and now he says well who is my neighbor and it was because he was wanting to justify himself so the question was for the purpose of self-justification if you turn to john chapter 12 i want to look at another question here just to understand this how these questions are fraught with uh uh eleven and and a false motive and it's it's telling the story when mary we fell at the feet of jesus and she broke open and it's descriptive here but just imagine this scene then took mary a pound of ointment a spikenard now those of you who you know are into your essential oils i don't know how many bottles you'd need for a pound of any essential oil i don't know if doterra is heavier than young living i don't know if any one of them have a pound of rose essential oils but this is a lot could we all agree a pound i mean you just think as much as as dry as it's been i you know i put a big glob of lotion on and it's i think it's young living you know and just trying to sit there and get get the lotion in and you get just a little bit like okay maybe that was a little bit too much and we're talking something that wouldn't even register on the scale not even an ounce but yet now here is a pound of ointment and the bible wants you to know very costly this wasn't a cheap thing very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment and now we we sat on the the right side of this we view this and we don't have any instinct within us to think oh my goodness what was she thinking we could just make okay a pound of ointment that's a lot very costly okay it's for jesus it's worth every penny right that's that's what we would be thinking but yet then said one of his disciples judas iscariot simon's son which should betray him and thank you john for nailing down this guy just exactly who he was he says in verse 5 why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor now if we could somehow enter into that very moment that mary is taking a pound of ointment very costly dumping it on his feet and the whole house is filled with the smell of it and then have judas who he would have respected say why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence in other words we could have sold this excess ointment for 300 pins taken that 300 pens and given it to the poor and i without a doubt i'm sure that all of us would have agreed this was a very valid question and it would seem as if his question is sincere that judas is watching he's not questioning worship he's he's questioning the extravagance of it he's he's questioning how far it's being expressed this seems to be really extreme and but you do you really have to go that far it's oh what's on the inside that counts and do you really have to pour that much out do you really have to sacrifice that much and just think that's kind of the same questions we're asked sometimes why do you have to dress that way and why do you have the token in your home applied that way why do you go to that why do you go to church twice and why do you go live three times why do you do this why did you do that there's a lot of questions they're asking there's a way that it can be framed where it seems well that seems pretty logical that seems pretty sincere and 300 pence was a yearly wage for a working man then it was it was enough to maintain a household for one year so when when uh judah says we could have sold that for 300 pence i mean you had people going wait a minute what you could live a whole year off that you could maintain a household of that and judas might said yeah i've got an idea that what we could have done is we could actually could have supported 12 different families one month at a time or we could have broken it we could have given this many and be thinking wow this seems very logical she gave worship to christ to such a degree i mean just a little bit would have been worship right just enough to get the feet wet just enough to show that i'm i'm interested i'm here i'm doing it and it would have seemed logical and it would have provoked maybe serious discussion at the time of what justice is and and value and morality and judas would have made a very strong case we could have all agreed listen we're not asking her not to worship and we're not asking her not to anoint his feet with oil but we could have better use of this oil we could support the poor for a year we could start a program and get matching donations and we could do a lot more with this substance than what this one woman is doing to the feet of jesus and it could have appealed to our uh our our passion could have appealed to our feeling it could have appealed to our humanity and we could have all been like you know what the right thing to do is to never let another person do this again and you look at it and what would have we been doing in the end we would have been questioning one's worship of christ and questioning the value of worship to the one who alone deserves it but it seems logical it's a logical question it's a seems to be a very fair question but then the the writer john helps us to understand this verse six this he said he asked why don't we we could have sold this for 300 pence supported a family for a year he asked that not that he cared for the poor but because he was the thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein oh my just exposes it now you would have thought that judas was asking because he cared for the poor this prudent question this valid question what about justice what about morality what about doing what is right and he didn't ask because he cared about the poor he asked because that 300 pence would have been put into a bag that he had his hand in he had selfish motive he had gained his own personal gain in mind in the same way the lawyer's question of jesus was with the wrong motive and with air in his heart judas asked the question not sincerely not for altruistic purposes not because he really cared about the poor but because he wanted to gain personally from it and the lawyer questioned jesus with air in his heart the same way judas questioned this worship of mary he questioned with air in his heart so jesus's answer will answer the question but also correct the heart the answer that jesus gives will not only help us to understand who's my neighbor but he answers it in a way to be sure if there's any prejudice if there's any bias if there's any self-justification if there's any wrong view of self if there's any wrong view of others it's got to be broken down and it's got to be taken away so we are asking i'm asking who is my neighbor not asking to justify myself not we're not asking to justify ourselves but to understand our duty if i could say it this way to a church to understand our role as a church because we must resist these these impulses we must resist these carnal mechanisms that create a culture that's contrary to christ it's very easy to have cliques it's very easy to have a culture it's very easy to begin to conduct ourselves in a way that becomes insular and then other people can ever feel that they're a part of it and then our attitudes begin we begin to judge others based upon the paradigm that we create within our own culture and we're no longer seeing others correctly and it's the worst place to get as an individual it'd be the worst place to get as an organization even if you start looking at corporate culture and it's not something that god wants to bless we've got to resist these carnal mechanisms that cause us to create cultures that are contrary to christ and i believe that as the bride of christ we can do this from a position of strength all too often defense mechanisms are born from weakness are born from insecurities born from complexes born from the idea that you think you're better but you're afraid somebody else is better than you so you've got to come up with ways to look bigger to look stronger to look taller this isn't the wizard of oz we don't have to come with lights and shows and some other ways to make ourselves seem great and powerful and mighty in dynamic we want to be ourselves and from a position of strength humble ourselves to minister to all you can do that because of who you are you can humble yourself to become a servant to all you can humble yourself to serve others you can do it because of who you are not because of what you're not not because of what you lack but because of who you are in christ you can have confidence that i can serve without compromise that i can love others and i can do good unto others and i can do it good unto all and not just the household of faith but do good unto all and treat others how others ought to be treated and not be afraid that somehow i'm sending mixed signals and i'm watering down what i believe we can from a position of strength love our neighbor as ourselves and do so without compromise i want to read this statement i realize now maybe i've gone up gone a little bit longer than i thought i would in this but i want to read this in closing brother branham's talking about being in new york city again and we had mentioned that how he was with brother berg and see that great big building now in the message paradox in february of 64. he says a few weeks ago in our meetings in new york city i come out one night from morris auditorium and we were walking down the street my son and i and we looked upon the people they're just thousands men with hair like women you know what they call ratted earrings leotards on men and women together and a poor old woman fell on the street he says nobody picked her up just went on see there's thousands of people in new york city and these are new yorkers and here one of their own you just suspect if she has groceries with her maybe she's one of their own they're in new york city a poor old woman fell on the street nobody picked her up just went on and i helped her get her oranges this is a visitor this is an outsider and i helped her get her oranges and picked her up like that old thing about 70 years old and she looked at me real strange and went down the street i spoke to the cab driver about he said mister when anybody comes to new york and acts like they're in the right mind we know he's a stranger he said them are good people but they just get into that swing think of this talking about something saying these are good people they go to new york they're good people but they get into that swing you take a man that comes here it isn't long till he's in that same condition he comes in here try to do everything you could lay there and die on that street and a heart attack somebody would think he was drunk they'd never touch you let you lay there and dying and then brother says see they don't mean to be that way it's just getting in the swing he said them again good people they just get into that swing just a way of thinking a way of life a mode a method and before you know it it becomes your thought process he says that's the way we do brethren in our church life we get into a swing of one certain creed or one certain thing and there we stay we swing with the rest of them we swing with our organization we swing with our community it's just natural paint your steps red and watch what your neighbor does they'll do it too one of you sisters get a certain kind of dress or a hat watch what your neighbor does it's an impersonation now it's it's not your neighbors it's your followers right post something on instagram or pinterest and everybody's like oh i got to get that too honey find me some mason jars find me some burlap i want to do something trendy hey because you see somebody else do it and you want to do it he says it's an impersonation he says it's a matching time we don't care whether our trousers match our coats we want our experience to match the word i don't care if our trousers match our coats we want our experience to match the word we don't want to get caught in the swing them are good people they just get into that swing it's just getting that swing so that's the way we do in our church life we got to be careful that we just don't get into a swing don't get into a way of thinking and a way of acting toward brother brown says here's a woman that fell in the street nobody would pick her up and then when he did she looked at him like he was funny you know i wouldn't mind if we begin to get funny looks because we're treating people with decency treat people with integrity we're treating people correctly we could just bow our heads hey you could just stand to your feet maybe if our sister could play i want to live the way he wants me to live let's just make this our prayer tonight lord don't let me get in the wrong swing i don't want to get into that swing where i'm not sensitive to other people and how they're hurting i don't want to be so caught up in whether my trousers match my pants and what color my steps are what kind of dress and hat i've got on the lord i want to be sensitive to how my brother's feeling i want to be sensitive to how somebody else is feeling maybe that'd be our prayer lord tonight don't let me get into the wrong swing and we could pray this as a church lord help us to know really who is our neighbor with our heads bowed and our hands raised let's just pray let's pray for one another let's just pour our hearts out to him our gracious heavenly father lord we're challenged by the word tonight we're challenged by the simplicity of it challenge the lord by the plainness of it how can we lord as we're talking as a family last night how can we hate our brother whom we've seen and say we love god whom we have not seen how can we lord be foul and crude and vile and hateful and spiteful towards fellow man whom we see and claim the love of god that we have not seen lord we're taught in the scripture it just is not possible lord it's jesus said to love you with all our mind our soul and our hearts and to love thy neighbor as ourselves lord that that commandment is likened unto the first it's because our love for you is then extended to our neighbor that in our love for you our love for our neighbors born from that love lord this is not a political love lord this isn't a this isn't a do the greater good for the greater mankind lord this is just loving the way that you would want us to love this is living how you would want us to live this is not having spite lord and having bitterness and having animosity lord this is not engaging in hurtful conduct lord and words that tear down but lord may we build up may we edify may we do it from a position of strength lord believing in this hour that we have the balm lord that this world needs believing that we have the light that our neighbors need the light that our family needs lord the the love that those that are hurting need lord that we go to them fine they will find them where they are lord i know how to reach them in their need and their brokenness and introduce them to a christ introduce them to a word that mends broken hearts that sets people on the right path and brings them to a solid place of assurance lord i pray that you help us as we go forward bless the many that have been here tonight to worship you lord lift their hands and to praise you express their hearts to you i asked our lord that you had blessed them for their attentiveness for their patience lord as it's gotten laid into the evening and many have a early morning tomorrow father may you show grace to us now father as we'll soon be dismissed may your presence go with us and i pray that you take these things that have been shared from your word and amplify them to us that we might be able to live by them and help us father each one of us now as individuals may we not be in that swing lord where we can't be touched we can't be moved upon we can't live the right kind of life bless us we pray now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen let's lift up these words as a prayer i want to live the way
