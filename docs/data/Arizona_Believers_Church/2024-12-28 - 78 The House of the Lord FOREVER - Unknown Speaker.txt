TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen praise the Lord surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen you can be seated my title today uh when I was originally working on it and just trying to come to a conclusion of this series on the house of the Lord my title was forever and if you'd like just maybe jot that down you could just use that as the title in your notes if you'd like but uh just wanted to present it this way and just title it this way uh the house of the Lord forever and drawing uh to a conclusion of series and as you end a series there's a lot of things that goes through my mind to where I was tempted just to feed all my notes into uh Gemini and ask it to produce a a summary that could be uh concisely given in an hour uh I avoided that cuz you there's just so much you'd want to share so many things you want to express when you bring something to an end but I feel today as we look at this uh thought of forever in the context of the house of the Lord forever drawn specifically from Psalms 23 I think it'll just uh hopefully hit the mark for myself personally but even more so for you all and as it is the end of a series we're also looking at the end of a year as this year draws to an end and then also a beginning of a new year I was thinking about it this past week how unique this timing is that you have the ending of a thing in the beginning of another and the ending joins with this beginning so to me it just feels like a really unique time where you can say definitively uh a year has passed it is over it's done and good thing we don't write many checks anymore so we don't have to worry about putting 2024 on the check when we date it and uh a lot of our calendars change automatically CU they're dig but for those of us who still have an analog calendar or whatever we call that how many people is it going to stay on August 2022 still uh that calendar that sits in our office but there's a lot of things you turn the page and things are flipping around and it's just a really unique time where there's an ending and there's a beginning and it does to me it brought into view just God's promises to us and his uh his presence with us as Revelations chap 22:13 says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first in the LA and the last so it's a moment that we can as we see an ending of a thing and a beginning we can view Christ the end and the beginning as he says he's the beginning and the end he's the Alpha and the Omega no matter how you want to flip it around it's Christ he's there in these two different endings and this beginning and as we close out the end and as things finish a lot of times our minds are on what's been pasted and it's important for us to have a Clear Vision for the future and so I want to encourage you today through the word of God in this very moment where we are December 29th the ending of a year the beginning of a new one this was kind of a New Year's message it may seem to be cliche but I want to impress this upon you in this sense Deuteronomy 11:12 it says in the land which the Lord thy God carth for so the land which God cares for I think you could put yourself in that that I am his possession I am uh uh part of his desire and what his eyes are towards the land which thy Lord God carth for the eyes of the Lord God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even until the end of the year God himself is watching out over the calendar as it were at from the beginning to the end and so we could look back and say Lord I know that your eyes have been upon me from the beginning of the year now to the end and not so much looking back to how he has been with us uh we probably don't necessarily do that very much but we start looking forward to how he'll be with us in the beginning of the year until to the end and I'm being I just felt like the timing of this was beautiful bringing this to this series to a close using this scripture in Psalms 23 I think it's just uh very encouraging to me to see it line up because I do want to address our past and some of you might be getting nervous thinking no let's just leave that alone but I do think it's good sometimes for us to at least consider it for a moment and address things past and give perspective to things past and not so much the ghost of Christmas Past or the Ghost of Christmas present and Ghost of Christmas future but looking to the past and looking at things that have been but giving perspective to those things so it would enable us to go forward properly we could be bound down by so many things and uh held back by memories and consciousness of certain mistakes and failures but as Joshua was getting ready to enter into the promised land God told him I am with you wherever you go the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest and he said be of good courage and don't be fearful and just observe to do those things that you know that you ought to do and it was kind of giving him perspective as I was with Moses I will be with you so he's saying look back and understand that I've what God has done and what he was doing in being with you but now go forward and press on towards the promise that is there in Ecclesiastes 7:8 it says better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof that's uh quite a statement I think that would would be that would Merit maybe a lot more thought than I'm just going to give it right now but when you think how God says the word says it's the end of a thing is better than the beginning that's a that's a pretty good goal for the new year right like if the end is going to be better but I think sometimes we stop and we think well I had such such Hope on January 1st 2024 it was such an awesome start and then you look at the very end you're like I don't know if the end is better than the beginning started out really good a lot of uh I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and these things are going to happen you look back at your bucket list and you realize you fulfilled none of them H and maybe there's a lot of things you're dragging into the new year but we can believe this as a goal for the new year that if it starts as this is ending now I want to be able to see This Promise of God that better is the end than the beginning knowing that as this new year begins we can say Lord I want the end to be better according to your promise according to all that you have said in your word as I dedicate my as you told Joshua to observe to do all that I've been commanded and trust that this could be a a help to you today in this using this subject of the house of the Lord Forever at this ending of a year and the beginning of a new one now now that the cliche is out of the way let's look back at Psalms 23 verses 1 to6 if you could just let's just read through this again because I'm I'm drawing from verse six there's a a lot in these first five verses that are worth uh tremendous uh uh consideration just to think about the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I will not lack he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake there is a making there's a leading there's a restoring he says he restoreth my soul many writers when they look at this and even to the Hebrew tradition they saw that these are liken unto one who has fallen and made a mistake maybe even those who were uh going to be in uh Exile coming back to the temple coming back to the house of the Lord being restored back to something that has been lost says yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me and there's that key his presence is with him thou art with me so even though I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death I know you're with me brother Bram takes that scripture he says how do we know doesn't necessarily ask the question he says the shadow declares that there's light shining somewhere so the shadow of death still testifies that there's light shining the AO I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me great truths represented by this rod and the staff and how they are Comfort to David he knows he's with him and his presence is declared through this rod and this staff he's making me he's restoring me he's leading me in Psalms 27 this this parallel to even this this verse here is though an enemy is around about me I will not fear because the Lord you are my light I will not fear what man could do to me because you are my salvation and though they a host gather against me I will be confident in your presence so there's this tremendous parallel with psalms 27 says in verse 5 thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies th anointest my head with oil my cup runthe 6 in Psalms 27 now will my head be lifted up above my enemies I'm feasting in the presence of my enemies very important to recognize this it's not that God brings you far away from your enemies or even banishes your enemies to a torment but in this moment he is giving you a feast and you're feasting in the presence of your enemies and then this verse here surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever it partners with one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord and I may inquire in his Temple that I may behold his Beauty for in a time of trouble he will hide me so there's this uh these parallel passages in Psalms 23 and Psalms 27 I think are good good good for us to keep in mind just because of the weight and significance of the prophecy in Psalms 27 and here David is seeming to prophesy I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever forever it speaks of throughout all my days the word as I was studying it in uh in the Hebrew it's imper petu where there's no ending date it's that quality of lasting forever and for the real estate Minds that are here this it's just this example to me helped me to understand what is meant but imp perpetuity uh essentially Without End when you hold a fee simple absolute if I was going to sell you a property that's how you'd want to have title is fee simple absolute which means you have full complete total ownership of the piece of real estate and there's no nothing that would impair your ability to sell it to dispose of it or determine who gets it after you die that means you totally own it and it's yours forever during your lifetime and you choose who gets it when you die there's a lot of title that people can hold it says you can have this in your lifetime but when you die it goes to brother Aaron whichever brother Aaron that might be and that that means there's a restriction on your ability to do anything with it sometimes you can hold title and you have to use it for particular purpose but if you use it for any other purpose title goes back to the person who has the fee simple absolute and so when David says I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever he he doesn't fix an ending date to it it it speaks of some sort of ownership and relationship and control we know that the term forever can be used to designate a a specific space of time or it could be used in a way to I speak of something that's an in has an indeterminate end but yet you would know that eventually it would end but David here is not limiting his habitation in the house of Lord to Eternity and I want to I want you to recognize that he's not just saying one day in eternity I will dwell there and he's not limiting to a space of time in his natural life it's not a brevity was reading in uh I think it was just maybe poetry just how there was Beauty and brevity sometimes there could be real Beauty in things that are just uh brief and summed up and our lives the Bible says in James 4:14 whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanisheth away we're admonished in the scripture to realize that we have no guarantee of tomorrow to not think so much of ourselves to think that tomorrow morning the sun will rise on my life just as much as it has all these other days of my life and I will have another opportunity to make wrongs right and do the things that I should but we have a our lives are considered a vapor it's the shortness of life life is not uh guaranteed to so many days it's not permanent this life will one day have an end when David says I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever it does not refer to uh an eternal presence in after death or well one day when I die I will have an eternal presence in heaven or I will dwell in heaven forever but he's speaking about right now in Psalms 27:13 it said I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living for many years when I looked at the scripture I used it in the context of a Rapture and that the land of the living would be a place of resurrection and it would be something Eternal and as I've looked at this more and even some of these prophecies surrounding this I realized that David was saying I would have been discouraged and I would have fainted and I would have given up had I not believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of living though it may pertain to the hope that we have in the afterlife David was saying that his abiding presence is with me now that if if if I didn't know that God could be with me now if I didn't believe that I would see the goodness of God now in the land of the living where people live and not in the land of the Eternal but if I didn't believe his goodness was with me now I would have just wanted to quit and go to that place beyond we know that there is no end to God's presence it reaches from eternity to Eternity and it is his presence in this scripture he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever the house of the Lord designates his presence his presence runs parallel to this goodness and mercy that we enjoy now the forever is not in eternity but it's now it's the one thing that David desired of the lord it's the one thing that he sought after Psalms 84: 1-12 if we could just read through this together how amiable are thy Tabernacles oh lord of hosts my soul longth yet even fainteth for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh crith out for the Living God this is David's uh this is an expression of one who desires to be in God's presence to know him personally to know him deeply not just intermittently and not just one day but now oh your Tabernacles and my soul longs to be in your courts I cry out for a living God yay the sparrow ha found a house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thy altars oh lord of host my king and my God blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee say la blessed are those that dwell there what an expression blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of bakaa a well the rain also filth the pools now I I I want to maybe just make a note of this in your hearts or if you're taking notes those whose strength is in the Lord whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of baka make it a well the rain also filth the pools as they make their way as they're traveling that they they take this Valley something that may be desolate and they there the pools are what they've dug are filled with water these pools are filled with water the valley is made a well they go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appear before God oh Lord God of host hear my prayer give ear oh god of Jacob say law behold oh God our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness this is that hyperbole to make a point th this is his this is a poetic uh description of how that I would rather just have one day one day in the house of the Lord than to dwell a thousand elsewhere I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to have a special place in the tent of wickedness the Lord God is a son and a shield the Lord God will give the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly oh lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee what wonderful wonderful strong words things that we could look at and really just pour through to see how this expression of I long to be in your courts my heart and my flesh cry out for your presence it's better to dwell just for one day in your presence than a thousand days without it I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God now it's not saying that we should um relegate ourselves to that but the expression I'd rather be a doorkeeper why to be in the house of the Lord to dwell in the house of the Lord was David's desire it was the psalmist desire so the house of the Lord forever it's a promise to be enjoyed now and always It's associated with his presence that is with us Matthew chap 28:20 Jesus telling his disciples before he goes away he says lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world he gave them the promise of his personal presence in John 14:16 And1 17 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you now the very things that David said that he wanted these are the very things that Christ is affirming that I will be with you forever that he will the spirit of truth will abide with you forever he will dwell with you and shall be in you catch how what what might have been something that David would say oh this is what I long for this is what I desire this is what I want to see but then he says I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and Jesus says that I will send the comforter the spirit of Truth and he will abide with you forever and not just dwell dwell with you but he shall be in you and he says that that day you will know that I and you and me me and you and you and me and I and the father and this this Union this coming together I was going back over the different places where brother brandham recalled that Vision that he had where the voice spoke to him said Don't Fear to do anything or go anywhere or say anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go we could see that as a very personal uh uh word to the prophet to Don't Fear to do anything don't fear to say anything don't be afraid to go anywhere because the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go and we can draw from that that his presence is never failing that he will be with us and even in Us in John chapter 8:35 it says and the Serv servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever amen think of how that just hearkens back to what David is saying I want to dwell in the house of the Lord forever a servant doesn't abide in the house of the Lord forever a doorkeeper wouldn't necessarily dwell in there in the house of the Lord forever but he would rather temporarily be a doorkeeper than to dwell in tents of wickedness but Jesus says the son abideth if I can say in the house forever that's a promise to us not just to Christ but Jesus as a son receives an inheritance it's his fee simple absolute it is his to possess it is his to inhabit servant has no right to that but a son abideth in the house forever this is what David must have been thinking about when he said and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever because I'm not just merely a doorkeeper I'm not a servant I'm not a messenger that would come and go and I'm not one that would just stand outside and long to be there but I have some right to it Revelations 3:12 he that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will Rite upon him my new name it's forever as we would read later in Revelation the city of God that comes down out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband he says to him that overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God he shall go no more out gives you a permanent place in this New Jerusalem a fixed status in the body of Christ you can't be taken out of it that I lo I Am With You Always even when you don't feel it we know there's the dynamic of grieving the Holy Spirit and it goes and he sets away for a little while so we can grieve the Holy Spirit but we cannot grieve him in such a way to where we become disinherited to where he would just banish us and and discard us to the side but it's forever we realize our life is but a vapor a man born of a woman is but of a few days and full of trouble as job said as it's written in job but notice this in 1 Peter chapter 1: 23 24 and 25 that we are born again not of corruptible seed which will die which will end which is temporary but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever we have been born again by an Incorruptible seed which is forever being born again we' have entered into a different relationship he says for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man is as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away that is those that are born of the flesh born of the will of man he is born of corruptible seed which is as grass which Fades away in the flower that fails but it says in verse 25 the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you this Eternal Word preached unto you brought you to a place of receiving Christ and having been born again by the word of God you are now new creatures in Christ Jesus you are not your flesh may die it may get sick it may wither away but you have been bornn Again by Incorruptible seed that lives and abides forever how else could it be said that I will dwell Lo I'll be with you always I'll be with you even in you and that I will be with you forever amen not just calendar days not just a space of time but being born again by a seed that will never die it is forever I failed to mention it at the outset my the though this is maybe the wrapping up of a lengthy series I'm wanting to be very very simple and direct today and I i' like to just coming to this spot I think I'm about halfway done here and I want to use this verse Psalms 23:6 we've been looking at the house of the Lord forever he says I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever he prefaces it with surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life surely when he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the the days of my life this is not a dark for boing uncertain future it is not I will it it is I will it is a shall not a well this is what I want he's saying I will dwell in the house of the Lord not one thing have I desired that will I seek after that I may dwell but now he's saying I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever surely goodness and mercy shall follow me it's not just a want he's now saying it with certainty no doubt is mixed with it there's some full assurance that that this is going to be his that this is a reality he's going to enjoy it's not just a mere hope so we can say that hope is the greatest enemy that faith has so there is this human hope so that's not rooted in the expectation which hope is based upon faith that when you have faith you can have a hope or an expectation to see that thing you believe in this is not a hope so this is a there's no doubt mixed in with is and he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me the goodness is that W that which satisfies to say that the goodness of the Lord would follow he's saying that there's something that would satisfy our wants contribute to our well-being he will withhold no good thing from them that walk uprightly he'll provide he'll be one that gives provision this goodness contributes to our well-being surely goodness and mercy this Mercy encompasses many different expressions and manifestations of God's love we've spent a lot of time on this Mercy it's misunderstood it's sometimes taken for granted but it it it has many different Expressions we won't spend much time on that but goodness and mercy will follow me this word follow I one I read one place where it characterized it as a strong inferior word means to pursue to aim eagerly after to chase after to secure it's used of the pursuit of an enemy in battle that if you were to follow after your enemy this is that would be the word you say well I'm following my enemy not as a spy not as one who's lurking distantly but one who's eagerly pursuing after an enemy with which they were engaged in battle you're hunting him down and one poet said it is as if God's love were so eager to find the man that it was determined to run him down follow after me God's love pursuing we realize we didn't actually seek God he pursued us it's as if God's love was so eager to find us that it was determined to run us down to follow after to pursue with the fo's Zeal your enemy how he would pursue you and Hunt after you he'd follow you but it also is to pursue as the Father's Love For His Child amen a Divine impatience a stubborn Grace I think the modern language would be a Reckless Love which never faints will never fail or get weary in Psalms 30:5 it says for his anger endureth but a moment you notice that the Bible puts some barrier boundaries on God's anger say well his anger will only be for a while he said well how can that be well once sin is completely be gone and there is no eternal hell so once that has some finished up there's nothing to be angry about so there is a termination to God's anger his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is life in his grace in his favor is life and not just life uh in the brevity of it but eternal life it continues weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning his mercies are renewed every morning his anger may be for a moment and our weeping may endure for a night but in his grace and his favor is life and joy comes in the morning why because he goodness and mercy follow even if he's angry that'll pass even though we may weep or shed tears Joy comes in the morning the Bible says in 1st Chronicles 16:34 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever surely goodness and mercy shall follow me these are not temporal blessings alone and these are not things that come by the hand of man but God is good Jehovah Gyra the one who sees and provides for his mercy endureth forever his love never fails the Bible teaches us when he says surely in goodness shall follow me and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever it invokes the idea of completeness the the soundness you begin to think about how God brought forth creation and created man and placed him here on Earth creative love this disposition of God placed man on Earth and then when man had sinned it was now Redemptive love that makes a way that man could be redeemed you find that God God just continues to express himself continues to pursue continues to go after his love endures forever his love brought forth creation when creation fell his love redeems it in John 13:1 just wanting to amplify this idea of completeness now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world under the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end it could be said that he loved him unto the end of his life but I believe it could be said where there's the ending of a thing it's better than the beginning he loved them to completeness he loved them unto the fulfilling of what he was asked to do he loved them not to just teach them and demonstrate Miracles and bring them to a reality that there is a God who made a promise to him but he loved them unto the end he loved them forever he loved them to the place to where accomplished that which they had need of the most surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life we should look at this and he Lo he will love us unto the end he will look out after us and care for us and accomplish those things that are necessary for our well-being and for our own benefit Psalms 138:8 the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me if the Lord's eyes are upon the land that he loves to watch out after it from the beginning of the year to the end will he not also look out after you the one whom he loves the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me if God looked with such favor upon the house of the Lord whether it be a tabernacle or Temple that Solomon built are you not the building of God do does he not likewise look upon you with favor he will perfect that which concerns you I know I've mentioned this before maybe I'll try to say in a little bit different context but we can give a a lot of reverence to this building and we have certain things we try to observe uh in terms of coming to church early and we're quiet in the sanctuary and we pray and we don't like running around and joking and we try to be real we want to be very very reverent uh to treat this Sanctuary holy a and and have respect for it but do you realize that's just even a type of what you are to God that your body is a temple and the same type of reverence we would have for this this room that we're in right now that we would want to have that kind of respect toward towards another human being and that we would want to we would want to have a kind of Integrity where we would show respect and deference to one another as the family of God because we are his house we are his building and the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy oh Lord endureth forever notice the Perfection is married with not just his goodness but his Mercy forsake not the works of thine own hands as I was reading this this past week it didn't necessarily strike me as a request but rather a statement he will not forsake the work of his hands his Mercy endures forever we ministered a lot on Mercy there was a lot that I kind of left on the table and didn't Express but I I feel impressed to share this about mercy God is always always merciful it is it is his it is his eternal attribute and characteristic so we ought not to conflate Mercy with the exercise of Mercy in other words if we feel that we have somehow uh if we feel that we do not experience Mercy or there is no mercy until we're miserable then we've we've kind of said that Mercy only arises and mercy only exist when something has happened bad or we we need uh we need mercy and it I know this may be a difficult proposition but if we say well I'm I went through something I'm going through something I need God's mercy and then God's merciful it almost begs it almost makes us think that well it's not until God showed Mercy that he had he was merciful but God is merciful trials and difficulties and and our do not exist in the absence of God's mercy yes right David is recounting in many of these places where he's writing where he's miserable he's in trouble he's bowed down he's anxious he's upset but your mercy oh Lord endures forever the fact that you've gone through something the fact that you experience loss the fact that you've been allowed to make mistakes the fact that you're miserable or going through it does not mean that God is Not merciful god is always merciful whether in blessing or Brokenness God is always merciful whether in gain or want God is merciful so we should not think that had I not suffered there would be no mercy God is always merciful and the fact that we suffer does not mean he is not merciful though he shows Mercy when we have suffered but we are as Paul says confident of this very thing Philippians 1:6 that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he will perfect that which concerneth me he that has begun this work will perfect it perform it finish it he will love me unto the end because he is good and his mercy endureth forever surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life he says and I will dwell this is this is the key to me I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever in his presence his goodness and his Mercy go before us forever as we Face the ending of this year the beginning of a new one I I'm very very deliberate to put it in this context I might have called it a cliche in the beginning but this is intentional we're closing out a year gives us the opportunity to stop take inventory think about what the future holds in the house of the Lord which I'm using as a phrase to speak of so many different things but now we've brought it down to this personal presence I'm a dwelling place I want my home to be a dwelling place I want this church to be a Dwelling Place there in his presence his goodness and his Mercy are forever they go before us in the ending of a thing and the beginning of a thing in Psalms 59:10 this is amplifying a little bit of his Mercy but we know in that most holy place there was the truth there was goodness there was Mercy all these elements come together in Christ who is the word in Psalms 59:10 the god of my Mercy shall prevent me God shall let me see my desire upon my enemies and we all like that last part favorite scripture Psalm 591b you put that on a bumper sticker God shall let me see my desire upon my enemies he says the god of my Mercy shall prevent me surely goodness and mercy shall follow me I I will dwell in the house Lord all the days of my life and there will be goodness and mercy they are the cherubs of his presence goodness and mercy these the the shadow of his wings this protective covering he says God the god of my Mercy shall prevent me if it seems to be somewhat of a clumsy language it means god the god of my mercy and it speaks of his Mercy shall go before me his Mercy will be in front of me he shall Lead Me beside Still Waters he shall lead lead me in a plain path because of my enemies he will go before and the word actually has this meaning of confronting because he's out front so he meets things as they come up the the god of mercy of my Mercy shall prevent me he will Mercy anticipates the need IT addresses things beforehand in Exodus 23:20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared he sends his Angel before them to keep them in the right way to make sure that as they follow the Angels he goes before them he's looking out after the dangers he's bringing them the right path to make sure that they reach the place that he's prepared it is God in his goodness and his Mercy that anticipates what we need and makes provision for it that's the thought behind Jehovah Gyra the God who sees that you need a sacrifice the god that sees that you need something in the future so he makes provision for that need that is going to take place you can even say right now for those things that you don't even know that you have need of God knows and he's already making provision so that in the moment where you find yourself lacking and you need it so the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that I I know that his goodness and his Mercy will make provision in Psalms 231 that's what we're quoting the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want this is that comforting encouraging reality in God 's Providence that goes before us that when we come up to something say oh this is lacking but Lord you knew you knew and you will make a way in Exodus 33:14 he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest his Angel goes before you his presence will go with us he will bring us to the place that he has desired us to be to bring us to that expected end I will give thee rest in Deuteronomy 31:6 this promise to Joshua be strong and of courage fear not nor be afraid of them you notice how the language and it may seem it may just be more instinctive but David says when my Wicked and the enemies and all these gathered around me I will not fear I will not be afraid I will not uh be discouraged though I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death I will not fear evil because I could be of good courage I can be strong I've been told to fear not nor be afraid for the Lord thy God he is it is that goeth with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee he it is that doth go with thee do not fear do not be discouraged do not be afraid because the Lord thy God is with you wherever you go he will not fail you he will not forsake you I'm drawing this sermon to a close even though I have some things here that I'd like to share from the message of the hour and and just even a A Hymn that I was just really inspiring to me his presence goes before us the god of Mercy shall prevent me he's going to go before me he's going to anticipate needs beforehand the Angel's going to be go before me to keep me in the way and by his Providence and his his awareness the Lord is my shepherd that leads me and guides me so he knows that we're hungry and we need to be fed so he he has identified a pasture to lead us in and defeat us he his presence goes before us his presence goes with us but the Bible says that goodness and mercy will follow us not only does his presence go before us but his presence also follows us forever you might think okay where are you going with this but it does say it follows us feel very impressed to put it in this context but some of us for some of us maybe all of us most of many of our most uh our hardest difficulties most difficult situations arise from things in our past and the depth that it would say surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life is so tremendous we could say right now well I I'm hoping for a better year this year we might all say Amen of that as bad as 2020 was and we kind of get that further on it's like man it we got nothing to blame it on now right life's just hard we don't like the way things turn out maybe we're not just looking back at this past year but we look back at our whole lives and there's just so much wreckage and turmoil and broken relationships and things that are fractured and arguments that never we never brought to a close or hurts or offences that have never been addressed and it just you look back and it's like this ticking Time bottom of our past is just waiting to Ambush us and I believe it is both the positive and the negatives we look unto Jesus and we look forward to the joy that is set before us and Paul says in Philippians 3:13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before he's tapped into this idea that if I am going to reach forth there's got to be some letting go of what's behind me I I there's I remember many years ago some guy's kind of making a a bragging that he could drive from his home to his office backwards just in the rear view Mir drive and I the debate raging debate was whether or not he's going to be able to do it and how early in the morning he need to do it and and just could you just imagine listen I'm just going to make a confession for brothers if you want to disown me I can't back a boat down a boat ramp I've just never been able to do it and that's what I want to learn in 2025 all right because you look in in the rear OFW do I go left do I go right what do I do and it's and thank thankfully they're getting so smart now you can say Hey Siri back my boat up right it's just going to do it for you but it's hard to look in the rearview mirror and get things straight and here it says so I want to forget those things which are behind so that I can appropriately aim for the Target I want to read this statement verbatim and not I don't want to paraphrase it uh and I should have wrote down who the author was he says our greatest troubles are ever those which belong to our past which come from thing the things that are behind us which we are striving to forget is that is there not a truth to this some of our greatest troubles are those things which belong to our past those things that are behind us that we're striving to forget and I I was even going to mention it it it during the prayer request to pray for me that I could have a better memory about certain things I they they're having these special services at South Mountain and brother Octavio having special services this weekend I wanted to go to one of the services and not only did I fail to go to one of the services because I completely forgot but I never even announced it and some might think wow that was really really crafty you see how he just navigated that whole thing never made the announ I just forgot and so there's things that you wish you could be better at and you want to you want to do better with you can't go go back and make certain things you can't go back and remember and do those things that you thought you should have done a few months ago but his presence not only goes before us but it follows us he follows behind us as one who soothes our troubles and can make everything well for it says in Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good all things work together for good with the Indian of one year and the beginning of a new one we face it with I will set Thy word always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved we think to put the word before us to put the proper goals before us wouldn't it be great if on New Year's Day our New Year's resolution was to to wake up on New Year's Day and we're done I'm up I wrote it I'm done it's all in the past what we do is we set things before us we look forward we anticipate what's going to be and so we want to do this that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever it's something Visionary something forward-looking we spent some time on that this year and talking about the house of the Lord how there has to be uh this forward-looking vision and you have to be proactive and you got to lay the foundation well as you begin to build so you're looking forward but at this critical moment I want you to recognize something not only is it something going forward but remember his goodness and his Mercy are also following behind and deep than thinkers are probably wrestling it out right now that this seems to be like a real philosophical thing how is it it's following behind well he makes all things work together for good all things work together for good to them that love God to them that are the called according to his purpose that means no matter what know sometimes there's these uh moral victories or certain consolations that people have and and you may lose the game but you weren't going to let them plant their flag on your field things like that to make yourself feel better on a Monday morning but there will be no moral victories for the devil there will be no scoreboard well at least we got this or at least I hit for the cycle there's there's not going to be any moral Victory the devil's not going to be able to say well do you remember this cuz if we could just maybe uh dramatize it in some way he could say you know what you you thought you were you you may be going you may be making it but do you remember this and if we could God could just turn it over and said yeah but because of that this happened and no matter what the devil would do he just scrambling trying to search and figure out well there's got to be some place I can say scoreboard there's got to be some place I could say I got him no ain't going to happen CU his goodness and his Mercy follow us I'd like to use this as an example example in the scripture of what I mean by this I don't know if I have I think I have one of these uh references coming up so I'm just going to read a few and then get to Luke in Mark when Jesus is there in the garden and he's been betrayed and Judas comes and he kisses him and there's a he's being arrested Mark tells the story this way and one of them that stood by Drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear if this was the only thing that was written we know this is historical and we'd say in this moment this is all that is written one of them that stood by Drew a sword and cut off a servant of the high priest ear and we'd say ooh quite a aggressive act and then and we might not know who that was and how this transpired but Matthew when he writes about it it says and one of them which were with Jesus so now we narrowed it down stretched out his hand and Drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smoted off his ear so we got a little bit more names to it and then John being who he was says in John 18: 101 then Simon Peter having a sword drew it so now we know who did it not only do we know that someone drew a sword and cut off someone's ear but now we know who did it and smote the high priest servant and cut off his ear and John says the servant's name was malcus he wants you to know all the details unless it's him the one that Jesus loved right just the humble brother John the jumble brother Han says he says Simon Peter having drew the sword smokee malus's ear and cut it off then said Jesus unto Peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall I not drink it so we know what Peter did we could say in his Zeal or his uh stubbornness or whatever his Humanity however you'd want to characterize this action this is an offense he cuts off someone's ear but this story presents us a unique Vantage point that I want to use to show you how what does it mean to dwell in the house of the Lord forever we can look at what that means in the present and what that might mean for the future but then David says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me we could just write it differently and say I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever in perpetuity that now present tense as we've built this even to this moment through these several services on his presence right now I'm in his presence he dwells in me he's with me even in me now present tense and forever and so David saying surely I will dwell I dwell we can say I'm dwelling in the presence of the king forever and he says surely goodness and mercy are following behind me goodness and mercy following behind me what does that look like in Luke ch 22: 47-51 his presence will go before us and behind us in Luke chapter 22: 47- 51 we see Peter's situation and he's been the one thanks to John we know it's Simon Peter that Drew The Sword and cut off malus's ear and while he yet spake Behold a multitude and he that was called Judas one of the twel went before them and Drew near unto Jesus to kiss him but Jesus said unto him Judas betray us thou the son of man with a kiss when they which were him saw what would follow they said unto him Lord shall we Smite with the sword and one of them Simon Peter smoke the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear malus's ear putting the whole story together in Matthew and Mark and John we know who did it he cut off his ear and in those stories they just continue on with the arrest and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ but Luke writes something very particular here and it says in verse 51 not just put up the sword and should I not drink of this cup and all these other recitations of it say that put up the sword and they go forward but here Jesus answered said suffer ye thus far and it says that and he touched his ear and healed him here's a a a moment of anger and a moment of you know Zeal without wisdom and he cuts off malus's ear and Jesus does just doesn't say put up the sword and they move on but Jesus follows after Peter's own mistake and he heals this malus's ear and I believe he made it perfectly well that in doing so he said well you're kind of reading into that brother Aaron well just let me read a little bit that he did not just heal malcus and he had this real Gody Scar and malcus would have to live with this horrible Scar and he say yeah Peter did that it wasn't that he put the ear back on and cosmetically it looked fine but he lost his he I that malus was restored to the moment that he was before the sword struck his ear and when he healed him he made him complete he made him whole and Peter though he made that rash decision in that moment to actually fight against the will of God to bring this great consequence of the shedding of blood Jesus healed the ear that Peter had cut off and I believe that we can have confidence that his presence follows after us to heal even those that we have hurt to write the wrongs that we have committed to even reverse the consequences of our own Disobedience and stubbornness and that his presence can cause us to rest in knowing that our past cannot come back to Ambush us that we are free to go forward even into the new year if we want to just look at it in that sense we're free to go forward in the new year without the chains of the past when I think I think of the children of Israel crossing over the Red Sea they cross over on dry land and you know they're following they're following the pillar of fire they're following the cloud they're they're following the pillar of fire out they're going to cross over the the Red Sea opens up a and they're moving forward they're following and as they pass through they look back and they see their enemy pursuing them and what is their immediate thought well great we're we're we're we're going to be vanquished yet that's what their thought was when they were at the Red Sea right when they got there and they saw him pursuing like we're going to we're toast we made it to the Red Sea we're dead our pastor is going to catch up with this these things we thought we got over these things we're Victorious over they're going to they're eventually going to catch up to us here at the Red Sea and God does a great miracle and he opens up the Red Sea and they pass through on dry land and the open of the sea certainly had the effect dramatic effect of allowing to pass over but now it becomes a passageway that their very enemy can also cross over but God designed it in such a way that he would use that as a means of destroying this enemy that could have forever haunted them do you realize that if God had brought them the long way around and they crossed over on shallow Waters that the enemy could do the same thing and they could find themselves marching towards the promised land knowing that if their enemy takes the same route they can eventually find them if they would have just taken their time and built the bridge and they crossed over the bridge that the enemy could do the same thing and they would have always lived with this thought will Pharaoh come back to get us again recognizing what we did and have something Vendetta against us could they come back but God orchestrated that Miracle as a means of addressing the past and he followed behind them as they were going forward he dealt with their enemy of their past and drowned in the Red Sea so that they were free to go forward to the promised land with nothing but the promised in front of [Music] them that's what it means I believe this is part of what David meant when he said surely and goodness surely his goodness and mercy will follow me it's from it's the behind he's working behind making all things well George mat he was a Scottish Minister I believe he went blind around the age of 20 begin to go blind at 17 he was engaged to a young girl when she found out he was going blind he broke off the engagement he never married and he he wrote such beautiful poems and Psalms and believe he died in 1906 but he wrote this one going before God I want to read it as we're closing he said I asked my God to go before to light with signs the unknown Shore and lift the latch of every door he said I follow Thee I asked him to prepare my way by kindling each uncertain Ray and turning Darkness into day he said I follow thee he bade me linger not till light he touched with gold the morning height had touched the gold touched with gold the morning height but to begin my course by night and day would follow me he told me when my hours were dark to wait not the revealing spark but breast the flood and Duty's Ark and peace should follow me you know it's how we're say Lord well just give the light Lord just give the peace Lord just make a way and he says go I'll Follow You therefore oh Lord at thy command I go to seek the unknown land content though Barren be the sand if Thou shalt follow me I go by night I go alone I sleep upon a couch of stone but nightly Vision shall atone if without shall follow me I seow the seed in lowly ground I sow in faith and hear no sound yet in full months it may be found that thou Hast followed me I hope that you can look back as Long Fellow said to see footprints in the sands of time in your own personal life maybe you could do so in this past year and say that Lord you you told me to go we may ask that go before me Lord light the way show me what path to go but he says go don't wait till the morning breaks so don't wait until the rain has fallen go go and and and do what you know that you ought to do I will follow you though it may be dark take your first step and day will follow though it may seem difficult go forward and peace will follow no matter how Barren the sand no matter how unknown the destination he will follow you though you go by night and go alone and sleep on a couch of stone but nightly Vision shall atone God will come and follow you so I say seow the seed in the lowly ground so in faith even if you hear no sound because in full months it will be found that he has followed you brother Brandon when he preaches there's a man here that can turn on the light December 29th morning service 1963 here res set December 29th in the morning just being reminded there is a man present don't get scared no matter what they say I've seen it come to the spot to where I didn't know where to move next but he is always present the never-failing presence he is always there he can turn on the light just using that phrase turn on the light turn on the light and he's not telling us to wait until the light comes on to know he's here he said no matter how dark it gets there's a man here who can turn on light and Rapture the church not that we would not we're not waiting we're not keeping still we're or just sitting uh on our hands as it were yes sir he's just waiting to see what you're going to do he can flip the switch anytime he wants yes sir there is a man here that can turn on the lights and he quotes this scripture those who set on the region of the shadow of death some of them under cancer some of them under the death of denomination some under them under Creeds death some of them under traditional death and all kinds of death and they have seen a great light the man that flash the light then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light that same God yesterday today and forever he is present today right here now don't get scared no matter what has been and though it may be that our past seemed causes our greatest difficulties and our greatest trbl troubles ever are those which belong to our past which come from things that are behind us which you're striving to forget Lord we want to forget those things which are behind and if you're unable to forget them know that his goodness and his Mercy is following behind you he's the same yesterday today and forever past present and future his Long Fellow said said on the title page of Hyperion he said ' look not mournfully into the past said well you're drawing a lot from poetry well I now this this to me just makes it a very I'm wanting to bring that one more thing out of Psalms 23 uh before I close he says look not mournfully into the past it comes not back again wisely improve the present it is thine says go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart this is the very things that God was telling the children of Israel to do it's what he said to Moses it's what he said to Joshua it's what he's telling us there is a man present no matter how dark it gets don't look mournfully into the past don't be looking back with regret you can't have that back again but he says wisely improve the present it is yours so we go forth go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with courage that's what we want to do to that's what I'm encourage you to do how else I feel that this is just a perfect end in my heart for and I I guess it's kind of uh self- flattery there but I think it's a fitting into a series to say go forward to meet the shadowy future for you for his presence goes with you and do so this shadowy future whatever it may hold in this new year do it without fear do it with courage knowing that he's with you the past he will rectify the past he will follow his goodness and his Mercy will follow behind you and he will make a way to make these things meet and heal them and soothe them and make them well and so I say improve the present how can we do this let goodness and mercy follow you all the days of your life let goodness and mercy be that which you leave behind as he said I desire Lord or you leadth me to walk beside Still Waters you maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures anyone can desire rightfully and and not be begrudged to be cradled in Green Pastures and to lie and rest by Quiet Waters but the desire to make Green Pastures the desire to make the waters quiet that's a Divine desire that's what we read about in Psalms 84 those who go from strength to strength the man whose strength is God's strength their their strength is in God he says blessed is that man who when he passes through the valley makes it a well and the rain fills the pools it was once Barren but but because this one passed through there there's now water that not only did they dig a well but they dug pools so that when the rain would come it would collect this is what it means I believe part of this dimension of what David means surely goodness and mercy will follow me got a great future because God is with me got a horrible past because of things I've done but his goodness and mercy will take care of what has been so now what I want to do going forth to meet the shadowy future is I want to be able to look back myself and see that I left footprints in the sands of time that someone seeing those Footprints could look at them and say oh I know there's a way to take right I find myself in this dry land but someone already went before me and dug a well somebody already dug the pools so that the water could the rain could fill it up when it rains God goes before to prepare the way and this truly is a great blessing amen something we could rest in something we could be happy with but the greatest blessing is reserved for Those whom God follows whose life will prepare the way for future Generations that having bore the Briars ourselves having gone forward to meet a shadowy future we leave a light for those that follow behind us let goodness and mercy be a legacy that is left let goodness and mercy follow me for those who are following behind me whether it be my sons or and my daughter whether it be those that are friends and those that are watching Lord let it be goodness and mercy that follow Lord may I brave the briers and the thorn so that the one following behind would find that this Valley is without them because I bore them that though I may have to toil in a dry Valley that if I could dig a well if I could dig Halls so that when it rains they would feel that the next one who finds them themselves in the valley will find that there's water enough for all let this goodness and mercy follow me all the days of my life and help us Lord to trust you in the meantime amen if we could bow our heads together musicians could come to their instruments and we could stand together and pray with our heads bowed let's pray together different levels that we could pray for today Lord give me the confidence to know that thou are with me Lord give me give me that faith that shity that David had that your presence goes before me it will confront it will address it'll it'll provide it'll make provision future going forward looking forward Lord I'm I'm confident that thou are with me gives us hope for the future maybe presently where we are now we just want this know we're in the right place we're doing the right thing maybe some consolation for we find our for where we find ourselves this morning and we could say Lord I need you right now I'm trusting you for the future but Lord right now I need you I need a special touch I need a a miracle and then there could be things in our past Lord I need you to address I need you Lord to follow behind me smooth out my rough spots in my past I need you Lord to show me you're working all things for my good Lord help me to find a way as you that day when Peter drew the sword and cut off malus's ear Lord I pray that you would heal wounds that I have caused address the wrongs that I have committed make things right Lord even if we're unable to ourselves just say Lord just I need your goodness and mercy to follow me then I trust that we could all pray Lord let goodness and mercy follow me Let It Follow Me Lord and all those things that I do going forward may your goodness and mercy follow me as a legacy as a as a light as a well in vaka as a pool of water in a dry Valley let's pray our gracious heavenly father I'm praying today for all of us as we close out a year and [Music] begin a new one Lord we want to we just want to we want to reset in some ways we want a fresh start I believe you're affording us that and Lord I pray today as we close this service and we ask your blessing upon the people that you would heal our wounds Lord ourselves for us those scars that we carry those wounds that we have Lord Heal them there may be scars Lord that you want to use and I say pray I pray Lord that you use them Lord where we have harmed somebody we ask that you would heal them as you did malus's ear that there'd be no lingering detriment where we've made mistakes Lord of our own accord and whether we've wounded family or family members our spouses our children something we've said or done or something we've omitted Lord lay it not to their charge and we pray that your goodness and mercy is just following behind us covering for us Lord and we ask that you forgive us Lord and we ask that you would just Deliver Us of any tendency that is causing us to make these mistakes time and time again that are wrongs being made right and these wounds being healed I can I I cannot look back in the past with fear of an ambush but go forward knowing that your goodness and mercy is following me therefore Lord with this new beginning with the fresh look make goodness and mercy father Follow Me by my actions by my activity Lord may it Inspire may it lead may it heal Lord may I be a well Digger may I be a pool builder Lord may I be a a BRI Bearer Lord let me be a lightbringer help me father to not fail in this great calling that I have in this hour bless your people as we commit them to you heal us where we're wounded Lord forgive us where we've made our mistakes and may we be just consumed with this vision of forever the house of the Lord [Applause] forever guide us I pray we love you we ask all these things name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
