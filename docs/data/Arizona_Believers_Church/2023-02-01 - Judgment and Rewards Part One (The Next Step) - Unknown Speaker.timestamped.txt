[0:02] So, I want to tie this in real quick to
[0:06] what we've been on in the first month of
[0:07] the year on the year preview, but we're
[0:10] going to do a little bit different.
[0:11] We're going to do the year preview
[0:12] review. Um, and maybe not get our
[0:16] tongues tied in looking at this, but uh,
[0:18] as we've gone through these eight
[0:20] services or so at the outset of the
[0:21] year, we looked at different things. We
[0:22] said, "This is a preview of the year to
[0:24] come because these are the things that
[0:25] God will find us doing, all of us doing
[0:27] together." and uh things that we're uh
[0:31] we have as a part of our foundational
[0:33] work and things that we believe in and
[0:35] things that we strive to do together.
[0:36] And so that's been our year in review.
[0:38] So I just want to review year in preview
[0:40] and I want to review those eight
[0:41] services just really quickly um through
[0:44] a few statements here. We'll start with
[0:46] the the sermon shalom and it says uh but
[0:49] what I'm looking forward now is what
[0:52] will I do this coming year towards the
[0:54] in betterment the kingdom of God doing
[0:58] more and all that I can do for the
[0:59] kingdom of God. That's kind of the the
[1:01] thrust behind what we're preaching is
[1:03] that there's just something in our
[1:04] hearts and our desire and this is a
[1:06] sermon that we uh had recommended for
[1:08] Christmas day to listen to this sermon.
[1:10] I trust you all did uh to listen to the
[1:12] sermon shalom. I've been drawing a lot
[1:14] from it. But he says, "As we look
[1:16] forward into the new year, what I'm
[1:17] wanting to do is look forward to the
[1:18] things I could do to better the kingdom
[1:20] of God. Uh what I can do to aid in the
[1:23] progress of God's kingdom. Uh not only
[1:25] as a work of God that goes on around the
[1:28] world, but also his work in my life and
[1:30] what he's doing in my life." And so we
[1:32] had these six things uh that we went
[1:34] through. And we did it in different
[1:35] services and we kind of over overlapped
[1:36] some things, but these are six things
[1:38] that I believe are thus sayeth the Lord
[1:40] that are God's will for our life. And
[1:42] that's to uh sanctify your home in your
[1:44] home to gather around the word. Um and
[1:47] as a family and as a individuals live
[1:49] for others and then things that kind of
[1:51] relate more to our operation or your
[1:52] coming to church and attendance. Uh
[1:54] assemble ourselves together. Uh give
[1:56] your tithes and your offerings and then
[1:58] support missions. And we went through
[1:59] each one of these things. I think maybe
[2:01] took at least a service on each one of
[2:03] them. And we shared these things as
[2:05] these are God's will for us
[2:06] individually. These are things that are
[2:08] God's will for us. And we used it in
[2:10] this context where brother said, "Now
[2:12] that we've been saved as we have and
[2:14] that we've been filled with the Holy
[2:16] Spirit as we have," which those that
[2:17] salvation really is the seal of God. He
[2:19] says, "Now we want that the mind that
[2:21] was in Christ to be in us that we might
[2:24] be transformed from the natural things
[2:26] of life and be brought into do the
[2:29] perfect will of God by transformation of
[2:32] God's spirit by his word." And so kind
[2:35] of our subtitle to the series was what
[2:37] is God's will for me this year? And then
[2:39] we kind of transition into I know God's
[2:41] will for me this year because I could
[2:42] look and see that these six things are
[2:44] God's will for me. I would say if you
[2:46] haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost,
[2:47] you should just seek that with
[2:48] everything that's in you. And that
[2:50] should be what that's God's will. He
[2:52] wants to give you the Holy Ghost more
[2:53] than you want it. And so there's this
[2:55] examination. There's this dying out.
[2:57] There's this repenting that we can do
[2:58] and say, "Lord, uh that's what I want
[3:00] more than anything. I want to be sealed
[3:02] with the Holy Ghost." And once we have
[3:04] that, brother Bram says once we have
[3:06] that and we've been filled with the Holy
[3:08] Ghost as we have, then there's this
[3:10] process of the mind of Christ having the
[3:12] preeminence so that we can be
[3:14] transformed to do the perfect will of
[3:16] God. So it's the these six things is not
[3:19] the entirety of God's will, but these
[3:21] things must be in place and foundational
[3:23] if we're going to do the further will of
[3:26] God. And the beautiful part of these six
[3:28] things, I'd say, is that all of us can
[3:30] do these things. that all of us can be
[3:33] uh doing these things together. And if
[3:36] you turn, brother uh Mitch, I think you
[3:38] can just take over at this point. I
[3:39] might have another slide in there while
[3:41] advance it and we can do a little
[3:42] tugof-war for a moment uh while we
[3:44] figure out who's controlling it. It's
[3:46] not going to bother me as long as it
[3:47] doesn't bother anybody else. I don't
[3:48] mind. But as I was saying, these are all
[3:51] things that we can do ourselves
[3:53] individually. And it's and all of us can
[3:56] do it,
[3:58] right?
[3:59] Maybe maybe it's a new crowd. Maybe
[4:01] nobody's here for the first month, but
[4:03] these are things that we all can be
[4:04] doing and we can all do it together.
[4:07] And in doing it together, these become I
[4:09] I was looking at this in greater detail.
[4:10] And I just want to touch on it very
[4:11] quickly tonight. These become joints
[4:13] that connect us and ways that we have
[4:16] touch points with one another, touch
[4:17] points with God. And in Ephesians 4:16,
[4:20] it's speaking of Christ from whom the
[4:22] whole body, the head, from whom the
[4:23] whole body fitly joined together and
[4:25] compacted by that which every joint
[4:28] supplieth according to the effectual
[4:30] working in the measure of every part,
[4:33] maketh increase of the body under the
[4:36] edifying of itself in love.
[4:38] That's poetry.
[4:40] That's that's beautiful verse the way
[4:41] that Paul is describing this. And he's
[4:43] using different phrases uh some that
[4:46] refer to musicians being in harmony and
[4:48] and and referring to other parts of the
[4:50] body that work in such sweet motion and
[4:52] work together and everything working
[4:54] harmoniously and and what I was looking
[4:56] at this in some other places in the
[4:58] scripture. This is how body God has
[5:00] arranged the body together to where each
[5:02] part works together. And I was
[5:03] mentioning this with the brothers before
[5:05] service that that's it's really a
[5:06] scriptural word when you hear the term
[5:08] synergy. It's just things working
[5:10] together. And that's what Paul is
[5:12] talking about. He's talking about being
[5:13] fitly joined together and compacted by
[5:15] that which every joint supplieth
[5:18] according to the effectual work in me in
[5:20] in the measure of every part and as it
[5:22] all works it maketh increase of the body
[5:24] and it edifies itself each part working
[5:27] together each one doing their part. So,
[5:29] as we all have a responsibility to do
[5:31] these six things and we have these
[5:33] things in common and we labor in those
[5:35] things, we have this energy that Paul's
[5:37] talking about in the body where there's
[5:38] this advanced effectiveness because we
[5:40] cooperate.
[5:42] Advanced effectiveness because we're all
[5:43] on the same page. Advanced effectiveness
[5:45] because we all agree on certain parts
[5:47] and these are things that we can do
[5:48] together. And and then the scripture
[5:51] reminds us that it's not all about us,
[5:54] right? that there's there's more to this
[5:55] than I, the individual, just me, that
[5:58] it's it's not only about me. It's not
[6:00] only about the individual, but it's
[6:02] about the body of Christ and his
[6:04] purpose. And so Paul is using the
[6:06] harmony of the human body as a
[6:08] description of our union together, even
[6:10] in a local church, but obviously as it
[6:13] relates to the body of Christ globally.
[6:15] And this our fundamental working
[6:18] together
[6:19] relates to just our basic level of
[6:22] functioning. And and I guess this is me
[6:25] just getting it out. Just getting some
[6:26] of these things out. So you're you're
[6:27] listening to my thought process a little
[6:29] bit that this there's a there's a way
[6:32] that the body functions and it's just
[6:34] all the base functions are working. And
[6:36] that's so that it's that has life,
[6:38] right? That it's not impaired in any
[6:40] way. But we're not just all brains in a
[6:42] vat, right? Contrary to the philosophies
[6:45] that exist that maybe we're just all
[6:46] living out a program. And how do we know
[6:48] this isn't a program or a simulation?
[6:51] But we have this functioning each one of
[6:53] our bodies and this the these different
[6:55] parts working together is just so that
[6:57] the body is operable and can function
[6:59] and can walk can talk can can do
[7:01] different things but that's so that it
[7:04] can exist as a living thing but as
[7:06] Christians and Paul's using this analogy
[7:08] or using this example the body but if I
[7:10] could say this as Christians we're not
[7:12] just called to exist
[7:14] it's not enough that we just be if if it
[7:16] was enough that we would just be then
[7:17] God would have been happy just being
[7:19] right but there was more to him just
[7:21] being. He was the God that was becoming.
[7:23] He was a God that was expressing
[7:24] himself. A God that wanted to unfold
[7:25] himself. And so, we're not just called
[7:27] to merely exist. But then God's promises
[7:29] tell us that he wants us to live and
[7:31] live abundantly.
[7:32] Amen.
[7:32] And in John 15:5, he says, "I am the
[7:35] vine. You're the branches." And what
[7:37] does the vine do? It furnishes energy to
[7:39] the branches. He that abideth in me and
[7:41] I in him, the same bringeth forth much
[7:44] fruit. That's that's the that's why I
[7:46] was drawn to this scripture that we are
[7:49] to bring forth much fruit.
[7:51] Now, it's it's not just we don't want to
[7:53] just bring forth some fruit. We don't
[7:55] want to just be fruitful, but whatever
[7:56] this much fruit is, we want to be able
[7:58] to bring that forth. He says, "For
[7:59] without me, you can do nothing." I if if
[8:02] I could just kind of sew these thoughts
[8:04] into your mind tonight from the
[8:06] scripture that we want to be those that
[8:08] bring forth a hundfold.
[8:10] If there there's some potential that I
[8:12] have, if there's some uh gifts that are
[8:14] in my my life or blessings that God
[8:16] wants to pour out upon me, I don't want
[8:18] just 20, right? What how much is it we
[8:20] want? Is it 100? That's how much we
[8:22] want. We don't want 20. We don't want
[8:24] 30. We don't want 60. We want it all. We
[8:26] want to bring forth a hundfold. That
[8:28] that's my potential. I want to realize
[8:31] the potential that is within me. And
[8:33] that's that much fruit. That's that
[8:34] hundfold that Christ talks about. We're
[8:36] living in that time of hundfold, I
[8:38] believe. And he says, "Without me, you
[8:40] can do nothing." And Paul says in
[8:42] Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things
[8:45] through Christ which strengthenth me."
[8:47] Now, I'm not going to try to change the
[8:49] meaning of this, but we know that we
[8:50] can't use this to try to do thing
[8:52] anything that we want.
[8:54] But here's one way to think about this
[8:55] that really opens it up to us. I can do
[8:58] everything he wants me to do,
[9:01] right? I can do a 100% of what he wants
[9:03] me to do through his strength.
[9:06] I can do all things through Christ. All
[9:08] things that are to be done through
[9:10] Christ, I can do as he strengthens me. I
[9:13] can do that 100%. I can bring that
[9:15] forward. I can I can bring that out. So,
[9:17] as we just try to transition now into
[9:20] this thought on judgment and rewards a
[9:23] and and we can go ahead and put that
[9:25] there now that there's a there's this
[9:29] tiein there's this connection because in
[9:32] this and the things that we're looking
[9:33] at these are things that God expects us
[9:35] to do by his grace having saved us as he
[9:38] has and that we now have the spirit of
[9:41] Christ in us that is to will and to do
[9:43] of his good pleasure functioning
[9:44] according to these things and we're
[9:46] doing these six things, these basic
[9:47] fundamental things. I know there's more
[9:48] that we can be doing. And that's kind of
[9:50] what we're looking at is uh uh doing
[9:54] more, but the key the key to living
[9:56] abundantly is first doing the
[9:57] fundamental will of God.
[9:59] Amen.
[10:00] We don't we don't want to get our eyes
[10:01] on like the the goal and say, "Oh man, I
[10:04] just want I want to be perfect. I want
[10:05] to be perfect." And kind of disregard
[10:06] the pl the path that God has for us to
[10:08] get there.
[10:09] There's a process that unfolds in these
[10:11] things. And so, I just want to make
[10:13] mention to it again very quickly. Paul
[10:15] says, "For we must all appear before the
[10:17] judgment seat of Christ." For everyone
[10:19] may receive that everyone may receive
[10:22] the things done in his body. Receive
[10:24] judgment. We have to appear before the
[10:26] judgment seat of Christ. We're going to
[10:28] receive according to the things that
[10:29] we've done in our body. Uh whether it be
[10:31] good or bad. So he's alluding to a time
[10:34] when we will have to stand before Christ
[10:36] and our works be judged.
[10:38] Right?
[10:39] That's the that's the picture that is
[10:40] alluded to in the scripture. So that's
[10:42] what I'm looking at when I say judgment
[10:43] and rewards is this judgment for our
[10:47] rewards. And so tonight, my my subtitle
[10:49] is the next step. So as we have these,
[10:52] and I think I've alluded to it a little
[10:53] bit already, that as we have these
[10:54] things that we ought to be doing, the
[10:56] fundamental parts of our experience with
[10:57] God, fundamental things we're doing as
[10:59] Christians, then these are all part of
[11:01] us taking the next step
[11:03] and being able to take a next step. If
[11:04] we could look at it many different ways,
[11:06] maybe someone gets saved and say, "Oh, I
[11:08] I want to I want to be a preacher. I
[11:09] want to I want to preach." Well, that
[11:11] may be your calling and that may be your
[11:12] gift. But there's things that God wants
[11:15] to do in your life in order to liberate
[11:17] that gift and use that gift and it's not
[11:19] just something that we're able to do
[11:21] immediately. We have to do the
[11:23] fundamental will of God first and then
[11:25] take steps towards that. And so my
[11:27] thought behind this this title of the
[11:30] next step is finding uh recognizing our
[11:33] position in Christ. Uh so it's uh it's
[11:36] pointing to the concept of being placed
[11:38] in your position. And so it's
[11:40] recognizing our position in Christ, not
[11:42] just as a son and not just being filled
[11:43] with the Holy Spirit, but maybe
[11:45] answering to the question of uh what
[11:47] does God want me to do? What what is
[11:49] some what's the expression of the word
[11:50] in my life look like? And so it's
[11:53] recognizing our position in Christ by
[11:54] identifying our office and recognizing
[11:56] our gifts or things that we are suited
[11:58] for, things that God wants to use us
[12:00] for. And I know maybe when we say that
[12:02] people start thinking, oh, is it a
[12:04] pastor? Is it this? It's it even on the
[12:06] most basic level is are are you a house
[12:08] wife? Are you a husband? Are you are you
[12:10] a man? Are you a woman? There's this
[12:12] identifying. There's certain ways that
[12:13] you begin to identify fundamentally who
[12:15] you are in Christ and what you are and
[12:17] how God wants to use these gifts and the
[12:19] way he's tempered you together. And so
[12:21] that's kind of what we're looking at
[12:22] even in terms of judgment and rewards is
[12:25] recognizing our position in Romans 12:es
[12:29] 4 and 5. Now this is hearkening back to
[12:31] Paul talking about the body and how it
[12:33] works together. He says, "For as we have
[12:35] many members in one body and all members
[12:37] have not the same office." Recognize
[12:40] that there's things that we can all do
[12:42] and we all do it together, but then we
[12:44] not we don't all have the same office.
[12:46] Paul even speaks about how there's
[12:48] different gifts, different
[12:48] administrations, different
[12:50] manifestations of the same spirit. We'll
[12:51] come to that here in a moment. He says,
[12:53] "And all members have not the same
[12:54] office. So we being many are one body in
[12:57] Christ, and everyone members one of
[12:59] another." So we have not the same
[13:02] office. That means the same work, the
[13:03] same function, the same uh transactions,
[13:06] the same understanding. We don't all
[13:07] have that same position. There's a unity
[13:10] that we're striving for. And and unity
[13:13] is not found in just causing everyone to
[13:15] conform with our own image or everyone
[13:18] just being cookie cutters of somebody
[13:19] else. It's the very thing that brother
[13:21] Brandham identified as problematic in
[13:23] some churches is that they just get the
[13:24] spirit of their pastor. So they all
[13:26] dress like the pastor. They all like the
[13:28] things the pastor likes. They all do
[13:29] what the pastor does. And they all kind
[13:31] of take the spirit of the man. It can
[13:33] happen even with brother Brandham. We
[13:34] just get the spirit of the man. And
[13:36] we're just kind of following in somebody
[13:38] else's calling, emulating somebody
[13:40] else's gift, emulating the expression of
[13:42] Christ in somebody else, but never being
[13:44] connected to the Christ that's being
[13:46] expressed through them
[13:47] by and therefore we don't find our own
[13:49] path. And if we don't do that, we're not
[13:52] complimentary to the others who are
[13:54] affording us the example.
[13:56] We're not just to imitate one another in
[13:58] a carnal sense, but we're to achieve the
[14:00] same a familiar experience and
[14:03] relationship with God so that we're all
[14:05] working in our in our calling to
[14:07] complement one another because we all
[14:09] don't have the same understanding or
[14:10] office. Paul puts it this way in 1
[14:13] Corinthians chapter 12 and and there's
[14:14] more as he leads up to his teaching on
[14:17] charity. He says, "Now there are
[14:18] diversities of gifts. I just want you to
[14:20] recognize these diversities as it
[14:22] relates to these are things that are a
[14:24] step further than just these fundamental
[14:25] things that we do together. Diversities
[14:28] of gift but the same spirit. And that
[14:30] there are differences of administrations
[14:32] but the same Lord.
[14:34] And there are diversities of operations
[14:36] but is the same God which workketh all
[14:38] in all. But the manifestation of the
[14:40] spirit is given to every man to profit
[14:43] with all. Isn't that wonderful that we
[14:45] all partake in this together and we all
[14:49] uh the gifts of the spirit and the
[14:50] manifestation of the spirit are not even
[14:51] for the individual that it's manifest
[14:53] itself through but it's it's for all to
[14:55] profit that we can be benefited by so
[14:57] the manifestation of the spirit is that
[14:58] so that it'll profit the body profit one
[15:00] another and I know that these things are
[15:04] uh expressing looking at the gifts of
[15:06] the spirit and I think there's more that
[15:07] I'm wanting you to consider than just
[15:09] the manifestation of the spirit through
[15:11] gifts that work within the local body
[15:13] but If I could think of put this before
[15:15] you in this sense the local body and
[15:17] this is the beautiful part how God has
[15:18] arranged this. You think God knew what
[15:20] he was doing?
[15:21] Do you think church is the will of God?
[15:23] God has a purpose to it. God has a plan
[15:24] for and the local body is a place where
[15:26] gifts are identified where they're
[15:29] cultivated where they're where they're
[15:30] encouraged where they're put into
[15:32] service. And there's a lot of ways that
[15:34] people are gifted. And this has gifted
[15:36] beyond pulpit piano uh uh and deacons
[15:40] and trustees. some of the formal offices
[15:42] that we recognize. There's gifts that
[15:43] people have that would never have an
[15:45] opportunity to fully full fully express
[15:47] itself, but for their placing within the
[15:50] body of Christ,
[15:51] but for the operation of that gift
[15:53] within the framework of a local body,
[15:55] within a family of believers. And it
[15:57] brings out certain attributes in people.
[15:58] And it gives them opportunities to serve
[16:00] and to and to labor in ways that they
[16:02] never would have had that opportunity
[16:04] had God not arranged it this way.
[16:07] It's one of the dangers of of staying at
[16:10] home. It's one of the dangers of of be
[16:12] living in a time when we can just all
[16:14] kind of stay home and and push the play
[16:16] button, whether it be streaming or
[16:17] listen to the voice of God on tape.
[16:19] There's there's dangers to that because
[16:21] now we're depriving ourselves and the
[16:23] body of Christ of that effectual working
[16:26] when we labor together and harmonize
[16:28] together.
[16:30] And so this to me is the next step. This
[16:32] is one of what part of the next step.
[16:35] It's finding opportunities to unite in
[16:37] God's service.
[16:39] finding opportunities to join together
[16:41] in service for God's kingdom and and and
[16:44] it's ways it it is the next step and I
[16:47] hope this is becoming apparent to you in
[16:49] this sense that these things that we've
[16:52] outlined at the beginning are all things
[16:54] that we ought to be doing. just hearken
[16:56] back to last Sunday when we kind of laid
[16:58] out that uh these are the things that we
[17:00] would do in order these things you have
[17:01] to do to be qualified to vote and
[17:04] therefore if this is what it takes to
[17:06] vote this is what it takes to hold
[17:07] office
[17:08] right so you couldn't have a situation
[17:10] where everyone who's voting attends
[17:11] church regularly a and pays their tithe
[17:14] but the person who's being voted in
[17:15] hardly is ever there never's paid any
[17:17] tithe
[17:18] that wouldn't make a lot of sense right
[17:20] and so there's there's this continuity
[17:22] when we are all doing the things that we
[17:24] ought to do and And if we're doing those
[17:26] things, it qualifies you and empowers
[17:28] you to be able to say, "Well, what's
[17:30] next?"
[17:32] I think sometimes the danger is people
[17:34] start, they got a lot of zeal, a lot of
[17:35] enthusiasm like, "I want to do something
[17:36] for God." It's like, "All right, here's
[17:38] six things you can do for God." Like,
[17:39] oh, no, no, no, no. I want to create
[17:40] squirrels,
[17:42] right? Like, no, no, I think you missed
[17:44] it. I want to start preaching Sunday
[17:45] mornings. And they're like, "Well,
[17:47] that's great. And you can get there, but
[17:49] this is where you can start." Right.
[17:51] And so the next step is connected to
[17:53] these things that we we've been sharing.
[17:55] But there are ways for individuals and
[17:56] families to labor more for the Lord
[17:59] beyond even these six things. Even
[18:01] though some of them are so general, they
[18:02] certainly encompass this. But there's
[18:04] ways that individuals and families can
[18:06] do many things for God. And I believe
[18:08] that the local church has a
[18:09] responsibility to uh promote that to
[18:12] provide opportunities for that and give
[18:14] tools and resources for individuals and
[18:16] families to do that. Amen.
[18:19] In the sermon attitude and who is God, I
[18:22] apologize if it feels like a Sunday
[18:23] night in August in here. I know people
[18:25] are fanning away. In the sermon attitude
[18:28] and who is God, it says the church has
[18:30] moved up to that fellowship with God,
[18:32] communion like Adam had in the beginning
[18:35] in the Garden of Eden. Now, this is a
[18:37] that what he's alluding to and what he's
[18:39] pointing to to me is important. Some
[18:41] there's some image about Adam that
[18:43] brother Brandon is saying the church has
[18:44] moved up to. And I think this is a
[18:46] critical part a theme in his ministry
[18:49] for the next 13 years even. How that the
[18:51] church was at this juncture. It's at
[18:53] this time. It's got to take this next
[18:54] step. He needs to climb up a little bit
[18:56] higher to see God in his program.
[18:57] There's things that he knew he was on
[18:59] the cusp of. And so he says the church
[19:01] has moved up to that fellowship with
[19:02] God. Communion like Adam had in the
[19:04] beginning in the Garden of Eden. Taking
[19:05] all sin away, free from condemnation.
[19:08] Holy Spirit cleansing us from sin. He
[19:10] says now you are free to exercise the
[19:13] next step in God. Good.
[19:15] This is just the way that God works that
[19:17] if he's done something, it's building to
[19:19] the next something. And once you've done
[19:20] the next something, it's building to the
[19:21] next something. And God is just always
[19:23] building so to a climax and to to the to
[19:26] the kingdom.
[19:28] And so Adam was in the beginning. He's
[19:30] he's likening the church has uh moved up
[19:33] to that place like Adam was in the
[19:34] beginning. And think Adam was placed in
[19:36] that garden not just to eat,
[19:39] right? He's placed there to work, to
[19:41] cultivate, to look after, to rule, and
[19:43] to reign, to have dominion. There was
[19:45] things that Adam was given to do. He was
[19:46] gifted. He was given the gift to work
[19:48] the ground. He was given a gift to
[19:50] control things. He was equipped. God
[19:52] equipped Adam and the woman with
[19:53] everything they would need.
[19:55] And so, he was placed there with gifts
[19:57] and resources to to work out in the
[19:59] Garden of Eden. And brother says, "The
[20:01] church has moved up to that place where
[20:03] she is ready to take and exercise the
[20:05] next step in God." Amen.
[20:07] And in the sign of sign of this time,
[20:10] brother Bam says when Christ died, there
[20:12] were three elements that came from his
[20:14] body. Water, blood, spirit. And then he
[20:17] relates this to the three steps of the
[20:19] new birth. So you cannot have the new
[20:20] birth without all three. Justification
[20:22] through believing, water, sanctification
[20:24] through blood, the baptism of the Holy
[20:26] Spirit. So there's your the seal of God,
[20:29] the new birth. Now he says now, so you
[20:31] have that. He says, "Now this last great
[20:34] step must come into the perfection."
[20:37] So I see how he's bringing and I know
[20:39] that sometimes we get so strict in our
[20:41] numerology like no brother and there's
[20:42] only three. No, no, no, no. There's only
[20:44] three and and we start getting hung up
[20:46] because now we want to go to four. And
[20:48] brother Bam said there's four death
[20:49] messengers and there's four life
[20:51] messengers. Now everybody's getting
[20:53] locked up, right? You know, they say
[20:55] there's seven church ages, but there's
[20:56] eight steps to the stature of a per
[20:58] eight levels of the to form the statue
[21:00] of a perfect man. And now everybody's
[21:01] like, "No, no, no. It's got to be three.
[21:02] It's got to be seven." Well, God works
[21:04] in numbers. But what he does do is he
[21:06] just gives his word. He gives truth. And
[21:08] numbers and types are the byproduct,
[21:10] right?
[21:11] They're not the body. They're not the
[21:13] frame. They're not even the truth.
[21:15] They're just things that project from
[21:16] the truth. So if you're reading in the
[21:18] word of God that now there's another
[21:19] step, you got to take that three,
[21:21] wherever it was, and place it correctly
[21:23] in the light and not try to use it to
[21:26] change the word. So he says then this
[21:28] last great step even after you've been
[21:30] sealed with the Holy Ghost. He's saying
[21:31] there's another step he says must come
[21:33] into the perfection.
[21:35] What does that look like? That the Holy
[21:36] Spirit has to live in that church so
[21:38] perfectly it'll make the head and the
[21:40] body unite together.
[21:43] What does that produce? It's the full
[21:44] expression of the image
[21:46] where he that Holy Spirit steps and
[21:48] moves so freely through that church to
[21:49] where now the bride is in the very image
[21:51] of the sun.
[21:53] The light of the bride is the light of
[21:54] the sun. It's that same image and that's
[21:56] what brother Brandham is pointing us to
[21:57] in a number of different places. And he
[21:59] says we're living in the time where this
[22:00] is to happen.
[22:03] And so as we've read from Hebrews
[22:05] chapter 6 verse one quite a bit I think
[22:06] last year uh at one point he says
[22:09] therefore leaving the principles of the
[22:10] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[22:13] perfection.
[22:14] Paul said let this he's saying let us go
[22:16] on into perfection. Brother Bram saying
[22:18] this last great step must come into the
[22:20] perfection as teleotes the perfect one
[22:23] Christ not laying in the foundation of
[22:25] repentance from dead works and of faith
[22:27] towards God. So, if there's a if there's
[22:30] a perfection to step into, how are you
[22:32] going to step into it?
[22:34] Step by step.
[22:36] Like, you know how to eat a, you know,
[22:38] 2,000 lb elephant, right?
[22:40] Bite by bite,
[22:42] one bite at a time. And that's exactly
[22:44] how you can do it. And uh not that I've
[22:46] tried,
[22:49] but it is step by step. Let us go on to
[22:52] perfection.
[22:54] It has to you have to be taking
[22:55] affirmative steps. And so we need to
[22:58] take the next step in order to take that
[23:01] ultimate step into perfection. We can't
[23:04] try to we can't try to do the a giant
[23:06] leap, right? We can't try to uh to take
[23:09] this step that is so far beyond
[23:11] something. And and and I know we use the
[23:13] phrase you're wanting to say quantum
[23:15] leap, but a quantum leap is very very
[23:16] very tiny, very small, almost
[23:19] unmeasurable. And maybe those are the
[23:21] kind of steps we need to start with
[23:22] first.
[23:22] Good. Amen.
[23:23] It's just the small steps, the small
[23:25] measures. get our feet underneath us,
[23:26] then begin to make progress because it's
[23:28] step by step, stone by stone, brick by
[23:31] brick, God is building back up this
[23:33] bride and building this church of God.
[23:35] And so, it's step by step that we step
[23:37] into perfection.
[23:39] I think that relieves us of a lot of
[23:40] anxiety when we think, man, I'm far from
[23:42] it. Well, how am I going to get it? Step
[23:43] by step.
[23:44] Amen.
[23:44] I'm I'm miles away miles away from
[23:47] perfection. You're going to get there
[23:49] step by step. He made the promise to
[23:51] Israel, by little and little, you're
[23:52] going to be increased. Footsteps is
[23:54] possession. So there's a we have to
[23:55] understand this god who has a god of
[23:57] process and who god is a process
[24:00] himself it's something he just unfolds
[24:02] himself in the message shalom
[24:05] but he's using this kind of asking this
[24:08] question brother Brandham where do I
[24:09] begin where do I get begin brother
[24:10] Brandham says at the cross
[24:12] begin at the cross with him
[24:14] repent believe the word that's what the
[24:16] Bible said then follow through the
[24:18] rhythm of the rest of the word
[24:20] you say well what shall I do just keep
[24:23] on following the rhythm of the word.
[24:27] And there's there's more rhythm to this
[24:29] word than just repent, be baptized, and
[24:32] be filled with the Holy Ghost. There's
[24:33] more to it than justification,
[24:35] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[24:36] Ghost. That may be the the intro. That
[24:39] may be the first few notes. Those are
[24:40] the first steps you take. The first
[24:41] step, the next step, then you come into
[24:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And now
[24:45] he says, "Now now get to stepping."
[24:46] Right? Now is when you can really step
[24:48] in harmony with the conductor. So he
[24:50] says, "Just keep following the rhythm of
[24:52] the word. If repent is the first thing
[24:54] in recognizing, do that. That's your
[24:56] first step. Put your next step where the
[24:59] word says on on and on and marching on
[25:02] with him.
[25:03] Amen.
[25:04] So this is this is kind of this is what
[25:07] we want to have as a rhythm within our
[25:08] lives is that we are all we're
[25:11] recognizing where we are in the plan of
[25:13] God for ourselves. We're not constantly
[25:15] revisiting our salvation. We're not
[25:16] always going back to these cycles of
[25:18] rebaptisms and going back to ask
[25:20] ourselves, did I do it right the first
[25:22] time? and do I have the Holy Ghost? And
[25:24] sometimes the carrot that gets dangled
[25:26] before us say, "Oh, no, no, no. You got
[25:28] to prove yourself to get the Holy
[25:29] Ghost." And we find ourselves in this
[25:31] pattern of always trying to work
[25:32] ourselves into those first three steps.
[25:35] But that's a work of grace that God does
[25:37] in your life. And you receive the gift
[25:40] of the Holy Ghost. And having received
[25:42] the gift of the Holy Ghost, you now have
[25:44] eternal life operating within you. And
[25:46] now that you've been filled with the
[25:47] Holy Ghost as you have, now you want to
[25:49] take the next step. Amen.
[25:51] And if we put it in the context of these
[25:53] six things that we believe are God's
[25:54] will for you this year, you say, "Well,
[25:56] what do I do now?" Then you look, you
[25:58] begin to look and examine your heart.
[25:59] Lord, what is the next step for me?
[26:02] Now, if you'll take your Bibles and turn
[26:03] to Hebrews chapter 6, I feel like I
[26:06] maybe I'm going painfully slow tonight.
[26:08] That might be a nice change of pace for
[26:09] some people.
[26:15] But Hebrews chapter 6 7 to12
[26:20] I'd like to u and again tonight maybe
[26:23] I'm just laying out my materials. The
[26:25] things that I'll express tonight I'll
[26:26] probably keep picking back up and using
[26:28] over and over again as long as we're on
[26:30] this subject of judgment and rewards.
[26:32] But read this. uh now not not moving
[26:36] away from the next step but kind of with
[26:39] this idea of mine that I I want to go
[26:40] forward doing all that I can finding my
[26:42] place in the body of Christ doing what I
[26:44] ought to do laboring and and that key
[26:46] word there I think would be for me
[26:47] working laboring uh uh for the kingdom
[26:50] of God and for others begin to think now
[26:53] about judgment and rewards and how I
[26:54] think clear it is in this these
[26:56] statements that Paul is talking about
[26:57] and then even the next step that there's
[26:59] more to this these this just salvation
[27:02] for the earth which drinkketh in the
[27:04] rain that cometh off upon it and
[27:07] bringeth forth herbs. Now we can
[27:08] identify ourselves as being branches
[27:10] that should bear fruit, being a fruitful
[27:12] bow, living abundantly, bringing forth
[27:14] fruit. He says me bring forth herbs,
[27:16] meat for them by whom it is dressed
[27:19] receiveth blessing from God. So now the
[27:21] image of the herb plant producing what
[27:24] was intended being blessed by God. Now
[27:26] we can also see ourselves as a tree or a
[27:28] plant that must be fruitful. And if
[27:30] we're fruitful, we will be blessed by
[27:33] God.
[27:33] So he says, "But that which beareth
[27:35] thorns and briars is rejected and nigh
[27:37] into cursing whose end is to be burned."
[27:39] Paul is making a clear connection
[27:42] between those who live fruitful lives
[27:44] and those who live unfruitful lives or
[27:46] bear the fruits of wickedness or the
[27:48] thorns and the briars. So he says, "But
[27:50] beloved, we are persuaded better things
[27:51] of you and things that accompany
[27:54] salvation though we thus speak." What
[27:56] are the things that accompany salvation?
[27:58] It's the let us go on into perfection.
[28:00] Amen.
[28:01] There's there's things that accompany
[28:03] the salvation. I know we've labored on
[28:04] this quite a bit as a church. So, if
[28:06] this is a lot of a review, then maybe
[28:09] it's just uh really cheap amens for me,
[28:11] right? So, these better, we're persuaded
[28:14] better things, things that accompany
[28:16] salvation, though we thus speak. Now,
[28:18] let's zero in on this. For God is not
[28:20] unrighteous to forget your work and
[28:23] labor of love. Think about what Paul is
[28:26] talking about when he says, "Let us go
[28:27] on into perfection, not constantly
[28:30] laying in the foundation, but build up
[28:32] your house, build up, become the full
[28:34] the stature, uh become what God has
[28:36] called you to be because God will not
[28:38] forget your work and labor of love,
[28:41] which you have showed towards his name
[28:43] in that ye have ministered to the saints
[28:46] and do minister." Now that's quite a
[28:49] mouthful that as you minister to the
[28:52] saints and as you are as you as Christ
[28:54] came and the son of man came not to be
[28:56] ministered unto but to minister we
[28:58] likewise in the age of the son of man do
[29:01] not sit here wanting to be served but we
[29:04] express the same nature of Christ in
[29:06] ministering and serving
[29:10] that he is not he will not be forgetful.
[29:12] God is not unrighteous to forget your
[29:14] work and labor of love in that ministry.
[29:18] And he says, "And we desire that every
[29:19] one of you do show the same diligence to
[29:21] the full assurance of hope unto the
[29:23] end." That's a fancy phrase. Right? He's
[29:27] that everyone could take this seriously.
[29:29] Find their ministry, identify their
[29:31] capacity, fill it up, be fruitful, live
[29:33] 100%.
[29:35] Because God is mindful of everything you
[29:36] do and all that you labor in. We desire
[29:39] that all of you show the same diligence
[29:40] to the full assurance of hope. So show
[29:43] the same diligence to to live a
[29:45] hundfold. And he brings it back again in
[29:47] verse 12. That you be not slothful, but
[29:50] followers of them through faith and
[29:52] patience who through faith and patience
[29:54] inherit the promises.
[29:57] Promises that accompany salvation. Not
[30:00] the promise of salvation. You have
[30:01] salvation of the soul. But now there's
[30:04] more to be obtained as it relates to the
[30:06] fullness of salvation. And there's a
[30:08] greater inheritance of promises now that
[30:10] you are saved.
[30:11] Amen.
[30:12] And he is on the subject of judgment and
[30:14] rewards when he's speaking these things.
[30:16] And
[30:18] maybe this I I feel I can maybe
[30:20] transition in this way. These are very
[30:22] small small steps tonight just small
[30:24] pieces that Paul is identifying a very
[30:27] important part of God's character. And
[30:30] it's very critical for us to understand
[30:32] the nature of God as one who rewards.
[30:37] And I know that we it's we are often
[30:39] reminded that God is a judge, right? and
[30:41] he's gonna you're going to get it. God's
[30:42] going to burn your barley fields, right?
[30:44] You remember that one? How many how many
[30:45] were alive for that one? I don't know,
[30:47] maybe some people raising their hands. I
[30:49] There's these fiery sermons where it's
[30:51] about God's going to judge you and you
[30:53] know, if you don't get right with God,
[30:54] he's going to burn your barley because
[30:56] God's going to curse you. And if you
[30:57] don't tithe, God's going to curse you.
[30:58] You're going to lose your job. And the
[31:00] reason why you're the reason why you've
[31:01] got cancer is because you're living in
[31:03] the world. And and and all sorts of, you
[31:05] know, rash judgments upon people,
[31:07] calling it the judgments of God. And
[31:09] that's generally how people think of God
[31:11] that he rewards bad behavior. But God
[31:14] does because he's just a rewarder,
[31:17] right? And so he's going to do it either
[31:20] way, good or bad,
[31:22] in Hebrews 11:6, he says, "But without
[31:24] faith, it is impossible to please him.
[31:26] For he that cometh to God must believe
[31:28] that he is,
[31:30] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[31:32] diligently seek him." Amen.
[31:34] Now, I know this has beautiful context
[31:35] within the framework of faith and
[31:38] seeking after him. But Paul identifies
[31:40] it in chapter 6. He's identifying it
[31:42] again in chapter 11 that this is an
[31:44] essential attribute of God. He's a
[31:45] rewarder.
[31:47] And as I was maybe just to close the
[31:49] loop on all the emphasis on God's
[31:51] judgment and God's going to burn your
[31:52] barley fields. If God will go to the
[31:54] extreme to evil, he goes to the opposite
[31:57] extreme for good. If
[31:59] he's going to give a recompense for
[32:00] evildoers, then he's going to give in
[32:03] equal measure a reward to those that do
[32:05] well.
[32:07] And so when it says God is a rewarder,
[32:08] it's one who pays wages. That's the
[32:10] that's the word that's used, one who
[32:11] pays wages. And a wage is something
[32:13] that's due for paid work.
[32:16] I hope you're I hope you're starting to
[32:17] think about this, that God is a rewarder
[32:20] for those that labor. So now we realize
[32:23] and this is maybe very very soon we'll
[32:25] be getting to the difference of the gift
[32:26] of salvation that is a free gift by
[32:29] grace and now that you've been saved as
[32:31] you have laboring and the the fruits of
[32:34] that labor being rewarded by God so that
[32:36] you are still judged according to your
[32:38] works.
[32:40] I'm not stumbling anybody. Am I?
[32:42] You're going to beg to God that the
[32:44] doorway effect works tonight because
[32:46] your mind has been soleied by this idea.
[32:48] This preacher said I'm going to be
[32:49] rewarded according to my works. Yes, you
[32:51] are. Even though you've been saved, Paul
[32:53] said, "We will all have to stand before
[32:55] the judgment seat of Christ and be
[32:57] judged according to our works."
[32:59] And all the people with the Holy Ghost
[33:00] begin to get nervous like, "Wait a
[33:02] minute, wait a minute. I thought it was
[33:04] over." It's an awesome thing to know
[33:08] that God still rewards.
[33:10] He is a rewarder. He's one that pays
[33:12] pays wages. Jesus said in John 4:36,
[33:14] "And he that reapeth receiveth wages."
[33:18] Jesus is even saying, "He that reapeth
[33:20] receiveth wages and gathered fruit unto
[33:22] life eternal." So he's obviously talking
[33:23] about a much greater reward than just
[33:25] one being out in the field receiving his
[33:27] just wage. We're talking about laboring
[33:28] for the kingdom. He that reapeth
[33:30] receiveth wages that both he that sweth
[33:32] and he that reapeth may rejoice
[33:34] together.
[33:35] The one that sws, the one that reaps,
[33:37] those that labor even in any level in
[33:40] this harvest, whatever we're doing, God
[33:42] is mindful of all your labors. and he's
[33:45] going to reward you.
[33:47] He's not going to reward you with more
[33:49] eternal life because you can't get more
[33:51] eternal life than eternal life.
[33:54] You can't be more saved than anyone
[33:56] else.
[33:56] I'm talking about a special category of
[33:58] people called the elect, the bride of
[34:00] Christ, who are elect to the new birth
[34:02] because only the elect uh can be
[34:03] quickened, have something inside of them
[34:05] that can baptize them into the body of
[34:06] Christ. Now that body of Christ, those
[34:09] believers, your reward isn't more
[34:11] eternal life, but God has promised you
[34:14] an inheritance of promises and promise
[34:16] to be a rewarder and to pay you wages
[34:19] for all your labor.
[34:20] Amen.
[34:22] Have a few statements I want to read
[34:24] from the church age book and a few
[34:25] scriptures on this just to again to kind
[34:28] of wet our appetite a little bit on this
[34:29] subject of judgment and rewards. And the
[34:32] church age book chapter three, brother
[34:34] Benham writes, "How beautifully the
[34:35] savior praises and commends his
[34:37] children."
[34:39] And reading through chapters two and
[34:41] chapter three of book of revelations,
[34:42] you'll show that God is always
[34:43] recognizing what's being done, good or
[34:45] bad,
[34:46] until he gets to the led church age. And
[34:48] he doesn't see anything good,
[34:50] right? Has no compliments at all. But
[34:52] he's he's watching and he always has a
[34:54] reward.
[34:56] He he's this is the part of the nature
[34:58] of God. He says, "How beautifully the
[34:59] Savior praises and commends his
[35:00] children." He takes full account of
[35:03] their fine spiritual attitudes and
[35:04] behavior. God's taken account. God
[35:06] recognizes. He knows that there's
[35:07] weakness amongst them. But as yet, he
[35:09] does not cry out against it. Isn't that
[35:12] just like the Lord? He knows how to
[35:14] encourage us in the right matters and
[35:16] discourage us in the wrong matters.
[35:19] God knows how to do it.
[35:20] Amen.
[35:21] And we should always do it God's way.
[35:24] I there's I'm sure that a lot of us can
[35:26] testify to this. You've been in
[35:27] situations where maybe you did something
[35:29] wrong or you were uh maybe dealing with
[35:31] some situation and all you wanted to see
[35:34] was Christ on the other end.
[35:35] Right? That's that's all that's all you
[35:37] need to see is Christ on the other end
[35:39] and and you know everything will be all
[35:41] right. That's what we want to be to
[35:42] other people.
[35:44] Is it there's a there's a right and a
[35:45] wrong, but then there's a right way to
[35:47] encourage us in the right matters and
[35:48] there's a right way to discourage us in
[35:50] the wrong matters. It's not just a
[35:52] matter of discouraging and encouraging.
[35:54] You've got to do it the way he does it.
[35:56] He knows how to. And he says we could
[35:58] all learn a good lesson right there in
[35:59] running the church and our families,
[36:02] right? Encou encouraging, discouraging
[36:04] in the right way. And better still, we
[36:05] could all learn a good lesson in that
[36:07] God deals with each one of us in exactly
[36:10] this way.
[36:12] This way of him recognizing what you do.
[36:14] Baby be a little not quick to judge and
[36:17] to uh uh point out your weaknesses, but
[36:20] compliment and build up and encourage
[36:22] and encourage you in the right things.
[36:23] And then once you're in that place of
[36:25] solid footing, then he can start working
[36:27] in these other areas. It's just the way
[36:28] that God does things. So he says, "Don't
[36:30] ever be discouraged, saint of God. For
[36:32] God is not ungracious to forget your
[36:35] labors of love."
[36:36] That's right.
[36:37] Whatever we do, even giving a cup of
[36:39] cold water to someone has a reward and
[36:42] blessing from the Lord. Amen.
[36:48] I think that's something to take into
[36:50] consideration
[36:51] that there's no ungraciousness in God to
[36:54] where he's going to forget all your
[36:55] labor.
[36:56] That even a cup of cold water is worthy
[36:59] of a reward
[37:00] and blessing from the Lord.
[37:02] Now, a reward. So, we're talking about
[37:04] reward. So, judgment and rewards. A
[37:07] reward is something that's given or
[37:10] received in payment for something done.
[37:13] Right.
[37:13] So, there's a reward when I mean when
[37:16] when uh Elliott opens his birthday
[37:19] gifts, they're called birthday gifts,
[37:21] not birthday rewards, right?
[37:24] They're gifts because I mean, he hasn't
[37:26] really done much to get to 15.
[37:30] I mean, maybe if we were living in a
[37:32] different day and age and he'd already
[37:33] fought in a war or something like that,
[37:35] hey, maybe these are the gifts for
[37:36] making it to 15
[37:38] of the rewards. Maybe that's what we
[37:39] should start having is not when you get
[37:41] a certain age, you don't have birthday
[37:42] gifts. have birthday rewards like wow
[37:44] you made it like my grandma's turning
[37:47] 101 I'm trying to find board games she
[37:49] can still play
[37:51] and and and just there's a this is a
[37:52] reward for long life for for being
[37:54] healthy and so this is a gift is
[37:58] something that is not merited or
[37:59] deserved so I'm making that distinction
[38:00] and I want to labor on it greater detail
[38:02] later but something given or received in
[38:04] payment for worthy behavior
[38:07] so I recognize what we're trying to
[38:08] bring into our minds right now is that
[38:11] there's labors that we undertake in
[38:13] things that we do, works in efforts and
[38:15] ministries and giving and sacrifices and
[38:17] all sorts of things that we do that God
[38:19] is saying, I'm going to reward you for
[38:21] that.
[38:22] Not gifts of the spirit or gifts that
[38:25] are given that are unmmerited or gifts
[38:26] that we receive because of his grace and
[38:28] and and separate and apart from the gift
[38:30] of salvation. There are rewards and
[38:32] blessings that are directly tied to your
[38:34] efforts to serve Christ.
[38:36] Amen.
[38:38] I really hope that I'm encouraging you
[38:40] in the right matters. Amen.
[38:42] I hope this inspires us a little bit.
[38:45] I'll use the analogy maybe at a later
[38:46] date, but I guarantee you that if I came
[38:48] up with a punch card for the first five
[38:52] people that get to church gets punched
[38:53] and then you reach platinum level and
[38:55] I'm going to give you an iPad,
[38:58] you're going to have your card punched,
[39:00] right? And you're going to make sure you
[39:02] get your points. You're going to make
[39:03] sure you get your miles. And you're
[39:04] going to make sure you put on this.
[39:05] You're going to make sure you get your
[39:06] status. And if you have to, you'll buy
[39:08] something extra, right? You'll drive two
[39:11] cars to church so you both can get your
[39:12] cards punched cuz bless God, this
[39:14] family's getting two iPads, right?
[39:18] It's the incentive. It's the motivation.
[39:21] And it would be wrong to use that in the
[39:25] wrong context.
[39:27] It would be wrong to use that wrong,
[39:29] in other words. But if you catch the
[39:31] thought of God that he's a rewarder and
[39:33] he's wanting you to recognize something
[39:35] that's part of his essential nature,
[39:37] he's saying, "Hey, come on. take
[39:39] advantage of me.
[39:41] It's exactly what he's doing. He says,
[39:43] "I've I've made this rewards program.
[39:45] I've put all the rules in there. I'm
[39:47] making opportunities available to you.
[39:49] Take advantage of it, bride. Please milk
[39:52] it."
[39:53] Amen.
[39:54] Please get everything you can out of it.
[39:56] Don't live below your privileges. Don't
[39:58] let leave anything untapped. Take
[40:00] everything I have available for you. Get
[40:02] hungry for it. Get thirsty for it. Get
[40:05] desirous of it. He says, "Labor for me
[40:07] cuz you can't exhaust my blessings."
[40:11] And so it's something related to what we
[40:13] do and labor in
[40:16] 2 John verse 8. Look to yourselves.
[40:20] This this ought to really I hope it
[40:22] fires something in our thinking that we
[40:25] lose not those things which we have
[40:26] wrought.
[40:28] So there are things that you do that you
[40:31] can lose.
[40:32] There's a work. There's things that
[40:33] maybe merit a blessing or things that
[40:35] have some work or some standing. So,
[40:37] he's saying you better be careful that
[40:38] you don't lose those things which you
[40:40] have labored in and worked for. Now,
[40:43] thank God we didn't work for our
[40:44] salvation because you can't lose that.
[40:47] But then he brings it right back to this
[40:48] thought of rewards, but that we receive
[40:50] a full reward.
[40:53] In other words, don't fall short of
[40:55] whatever your full potential is.
[40:58] We should strive for, as John says, a
[41:00] full reward,
[41:02] that I want to I don't want to lose the
[41:04] benefit of anything I've labored for. If
[41:07] I have a if I have a if I have a a a
[41:11] testimony and a labor and I've been
[41:13] doing things for God, I don't want to
[41:15] undo whatever benefits and blessings may
[41:17] be coming my way by getting slack or by
[41:19] by uh doing things that I ought to do.
[41:21] There's things that we want to labor in
[41:23] that we not lose the reward of them. And
[41:25] he calls it a full reward.
[41:30] I think that we could even pray for
[41:31] revelation of what those things are.
[41:35] In the brother Brandham writes this in
[41:37] chapter 7 of the church age book. He
[41:38] says, "And they shall walk with me."
[41:39] This is taking again from the remarks to
[41:42] the Sardisian church age. And they shall
[41:44] walk with me. That is what God says he
[41:46] will bestow upon them for this upright
[41:49] walk. That is part of their inheritance
[41:52] that he's reserved for them. So there's
[41:54] this inherit, you know, the the promises
[41:57] that we're to inherit.
[41:59] And he says if they were willing to walk
[42:02] with him through the toils and snares of
[42:04] life and be honor an honor to him, he
[42:06] was going to reward them. He is not
[42:09] forgetful. Now this turns away from the
[42:11] sardans specifically and now to all of
[42:14] us generally. He is not forgetful of our
[42:16] labor of love. Read this together. God
[42:19] will always recompense us for our
[42:22] efforts to please him.
[42:24] God will always give you a reward.
[42:28] Thank God for even our efforts to please
[42:31] him.
[42:33] God will always reward us. Recompenses
[42:35] recompense pay us
[42:37] for our efforts to please him.
[42:40] There are so there's this to me these
[42:41] are the these are fundamental things to
[42:43] this subject of judgment and rewards.
[42:45] And I want you to recognize that it's
[42:46] the it's at the fabric of the message
[42:48] that God has a heart to pay you.
[42:50] Amen. to pay you back the for the things
[42:52] that you labor in that and it's it's
[42:55] complete through the scripture where God
[42:56] is going to give back in anything you
[42:58] give. He says, "Draw none to me, I'll
[42:59] draw none unto you."
[43:02] That's just in the nature of God, the
[43:03] giving nature of God, he will always
[43:05] recompense us for our efforts to please
[43:07] him.
[43:08] So, as we are laboring for him, we're
[43:10] building up a a a storehouse of things
[43:15] that God wants to give back to us.
[43:17] Amen.
[43:19] And Jesus says in Matthew chapter 6 19
[43:21] and 20, "Lay not up for yourselves
[43:24] treasures upon earth, where moth and
[43:26] rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
[43:29] break through and steal,
[43:31] but lay up for yourselves treasures in
[43:33] heaven."
[43:35] I believe the the message lyric is
[43:37] sending up timber.
[43:39] Lay up for yourselves treasures in
[43:41] heaven where neither moth nor rust doth
[43:43] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[43:45] through nor steal. How is it I can lay
[43:48] up treasures in heaven? How is it that I
[43:50] can be actively depositing a treasure in
[43:53] heaven? I know we touched on it recently
[43:55] how that uh where our heart is there
[43:58] where your treasure be also. And so
[43:59] there's this connection of things that
[44:01] you pursue and things that you value. It
[44:02] becomes your treasure becomes where your
[44:04] heart is. And so we're to lay up for
[44:05] ourselves treasures in heaven
[44:08] to seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[44:11] That there's there's value in that. And
[44:14] that if we are pursuing
[44:16] the things of God here on earth that
[44:19] there's some there's something that God
[44:21] will pay us back that's commisserate to
[44:22] our labor.
[44:24] Amen.
[44:24] That there's an interest being earned
[44:26] there. There's there's a treasure being
[44:28] stored up. And God is reckoning
[44:30] everything you do in your labor for the
[44:32] kingdom. He's not forgetful of our labor
[44:34] of love. He will always recompense us
[44:36] for our efforts to please him. That
[44:38] every effort to please him has
[44:40] registered in heaven. and that you've
[44:42] stored up a blessing. You've stored up
[44:44] some reward. You've stored up something
[44:45] that God one day wants to open up out
[44:48] for you.
[44:50] Amen.
[44:51] Brother Brandham says it this way in
[44:52] chapter five of the church age book. For
[44:54] each message, you can see this through
[44:56] book of revelation. Each message to each
[44:58] age holds out an incentive to the
[45:01] believer
[45:03] encouraging him to be an overcomer and
[45:05] thereby rewarded of the Lord.
[45:07] So these aren't dirty words. Incentive.
[45:11] God giving you an incentive, laboring
[45:13] for the reward, thinking about the the
[45:15] laying up treasures in heaven. It's not
[45:17] wrong to think about that in the right
[45:19] way.
[45:23] And I'll
[45:25] take one last statement from chapter 4
[45:28] of the church age book.
[45:31] He says, "Since not even a cup of cold
[45:33] water given in the name of the Lord
[45:34] fails to receive a reward,
[45:38] how great shall be the reward to him who
[45:40] gives his life as a martyr for the name
[45:41] of the Lord Jesus."
[45:45] Perhaps we can get a small idea if we
[45:47] compare this crown with the crown won in
[45:49] a race. 1 Corinthians 9:24, Paul says,
[45:51] "Know ye not that they which run in a
[45:53] race run all, but one receiveth the
[45:55] prize. So run that you may obtain." A
[45:58] crown given to the winner of the Olympic
[46:00] race was a garland of olive branches.
[46:02] But the crown spoken of here in the
[46:04] revelation given to a martyr is the
[46:05] crown of royalty. Jesus calls it the
[46:08] crown of life. The one crown is for
[46:10] those who have striven. The other is for
[46:13] those who have given. Both crowns are
[46:15] incorruptible. They will not perish.
[46:20] These crowns that are being given out.
[46:21] What a beautiful picture.
[46:24] The winners of the worldly race of life
[46:25] will soon lose the joy of the plottits
[46:27] of the world. Their glory will fail. I'm
[46:31] closing. So think about this.
[46:34] I'm not joking. Promise. There's some
[46:38] skeptics amongst us.
[46:40] But those who give their lives for God
[46:43] either by daily striving or shedding
[46:45] their blood as the crowning sacrifice of
[46:47] their lives will be given the crown of
[46:49] life.
[46:51] All too little time is spent on laboring
[46:54] for the eternal rewards of God.
[46:58] That's pretty plain English.
[47:00] We spend too little time laboring for
[47:02] God's rewards.
[47:03] Amen.
[47:04] We will spend all our time laboring for
[47:07] the milestones of this world, the
[47:08] achievements, the the the badges and and
[47:11] the levels and everything that we can
[47:13] do, whether it be in the games that we
[47:15] we play so that we can get the the
[47:17] crates. Is that it? chest. Chest. See,
[47:20] they don't think they don't think I know
[47:21] this,
[47:23] but you try and you labor to get the
[47:25] chest. I should probably write it down
[47:26] so I don't forget it. And so you could
[47:29] get to the next level, right? And you
[47:31] could you could get the the next badge
[47:32] and you could have the new the new suit
[47:34] of armor or something. We labor for
[47:36] those things. And I'm not just talking
[47:38] about our teenagers. I'm talking about
[47:40] adults, too. They do it so they get
[47:42] enough fuel points. They do it so they
[47:43] get enough status and they get early
[47:45] leads on deals and they can shop early
[47:47] at certain places. There's a lot of
[47:48] things we do so we can be in the top 1%
[47:50] of all the for that of that artist
[47:53] listening audience on Spotify. I got a
[47:55] personal message from Michael W. Smith
[47:57] this year. I was in his top 1% thanks to
[48:00] his Christmas album, right? And we want
[48:03] to have those levels and we want to have
[48:04] those achievements and we want to we
[48:06] want to be recognized. And brother
[48:07] Brandham is hitting the nail on the
[48:09] head. All too little time is spent
[48:11] laboring for the eternal rewards of God.
[48:15] And we need to be awakened to this
[48:17] concept that God is a rewarder and he
[48:19] has a reward program that we ought to
[48:21] daily be laboring in because I'm telling
[48:23] you it's the best one there is.
[48:28] Maybe I should get the points guy to do
[48:29] a blog post on it.
[48:31] This is the best rewards program.
[48:34] This dollar for dollar, mile for mile,
[48:36] point for point. This is the best
[48:39] program there is.
[48:41] All too little time is spent on laboring
[48:44] for the eternal rewards of God. He says
[48:46] the recompense of God is too lightly
[48:48] esteemed.
[48:50] Let us not be guilty anymore of lightly
[48:52] esteeming the wages of God, the payments
[48:55] of God, the rewards of God. Oh, it's one
[48:58] thing to be afraid of his judgments
[49:01] and to be afraid that he's going to
[49:03] judge us, but let us not be slack in
[49:06] desirous of his rewards.
[49:08] In the same amount that you would want
[49:10] to avoid any judgment that would come
[49:11] your way, we ought to be desirous that
[49:13] we would be judged worthy of a reward
[49:15] and that we would not lightly esteem the
[49:17] judgments of God and the rewards of God.
[49:21] If we believe in the reality of the
[49:22] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[49:24] kingdom of substance, then we ought to
[49:26] lay up in heaven those good treasures
[49:30] that are available to the faithful
[49:31] saints.
[49:33] There are good treasures available to
[49:35] us. There are rewards that we can be
[49:37] earning on a daily basis. And you say,
[49:40] "Well, is there a reward for this? Is
[49:41] there a reward for that?" Why don't you
[49:43] start reading the terms?
[49:46] Dig into it. Find out what you got.
[49:48] because we spend too little time
[49:50] laboring for the eternal rewards of God.
[49:52] And we ought to lay up in heaven those
[49:54] good treasures that are available to the
[49:57] faithful sta saints.
[50:00] Praise the Lord.
[50:02] I'm done. Let's stand.
