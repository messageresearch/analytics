TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ruth chapter one start with verse one read to verse two and we're going to be focusing on verse two today and uh we could have read maybe a little bit further but i really just wanna focus on these details that are setting the scene for the book of ruth and for this tremendous happening that takes place in it and where our subject is about the bread of life and how the living bread of life has been made available to the bride in this end time and it's feasting on that bread that's going to lead us to a meeting in the air into the change of our bodies and it says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife was naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and kilian efratees of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there god bless you you can take your seats well you can leave them when you leave but you can have your seats now while i remain standing i in the message kinsmen redeem i just want to pick right up where we were last time this was the last statement that we read we're looking at the setting of the book of ruth and we focused on chapter verse one last time and i want to just read this statement again because i believe it sums up a lot of our emphasis last wednesday brother braham says this book of ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted why if it's just a love story why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired it's just written to kind of tell the story of a wonderful happening between a woman who was a foreigner and a man who uh you know had pity upon her and married her and redeemed her if all it was was a love story why would it be canonized in the scripture why would it become part of this the old testament he says because there's a hidden revelation in it and just that phrase there ought to kind of strike a nerve inside of us because we believe that god has even in this last days preserved and made available to us hidden manna hidden revelation for us who are feasting in this end time it says there's a hidden revelation in it and in this hidden revelation you catch the real meanings you've got to see the revelation and understand the revelation and then if you do that you can catch the real meaning and in doing so i just love this phrase it'll bring you real close to god i desire to be closer to god than i am right now i want to be closer to god he says it'll bring you real close to god and i pray my whole soul this morning that god will catch every heart so spellbound so this is something that had some weight and force upon brother branham as he's ministering it christ being preached as the kinsmen redeemer wouldn't have been a foreign subject but there's something that he's seeing and something that he's breaking into something that's moving him that he's praying with all his soul that god would catch every heart so spellbound so attracted and so gravitated to this until he'll reveal himself just what he is in this story what he is to you how to accept him just to see him what he is in this story but then not just to see him in a story but to see what he is to us and then also how we can accept him for all that he is to us he says and when you once see it it's so simple you'll wonder how you ever went over the top of it but it can only be revealed by the holy spirit so the book of ruth holds a tremendous story a great story think of all the statements that brother branham made about this book it's something very significant something very special that just goes beyond a history to we understand everyday life to the hebrew people it goes beyond the love story but there's a hidden revelation in it and i believe it contains a hidden revelation for the bride of jesus christ and if look at verse one again and i'll read it and then try to maybe make some points back to what we ministered last time it says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled so it's set in the time period where this takes place a time when israel had not yet entered into having kings it was in a time when men just were living loose with god and they would come back to god when a judge would come they'd swing back to god and they're going back and forth between serving jehovah serving bail serving jehovah serving bail and there was a a lot of lukewarmness and a lot of ups and downs during this time period it says and there was a famine in the land we saw how this famine was a direct result of the children of god rejecting the lord having gotten away from the lord god said if you get away from me there'll be a judgment that comes and so this famine was a result of their disobedience and now the focus is on a certain man a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of mohammed or go into the fields of moab the plains of moab to go to a place of the moabites and he comes from bethlehem judah he and his wife and his two sons this is how the story opens there's a famine and a man with his wife and two sons go to bethlehem go from bethlehem judah to moab and the word soldier they meant to leave just for a little while but ultimately come back like the things we're just going to take what we have now we're going to go for a little while into uh to moab and then just stay for a little bit and then we're going to come back into bethlehem judah that was their intent and i want to pick up with verse 2 and there was a lot more that we expressed in verse 1 last time but i feel impressed just to not belabor the foundation and now it's going to expound upon who this certain man was his wife and his two sons and it says in the name of the man was elimelech now there's the the setting to this story is important the fact that it says it was in judges we already saw why that was important the fact that there was a famine in the land we saw that that was important we realized that even saying that this man was from bethlehem judah was quite striking to come from a place of abundance and a place that was very fruitful and had gained its name because it was the house of bread and to see that they were intending to souljarn and just go for a little while into the the country of moab and to the field of moab we saw that to go that way they'd have to reverse the course of the exodus and go right back into the wilderness that god had called them out of so each each phrase that's being used thus far each kind of image that's being brought up is important for us to catch because it's said in a story not just for a love story it's not something where if you miss this part of the movie you're not going to understand the plot this is not just a love story this is not just something with the neat plot this is a book that has a hidden revelation in it and i believe there's meaning in every verse and every line and every phrase and there's a way that god is trying to convey this story such that if you if it can catch your heart spellbound he can begin to reveal himself to you and and then reveal himself what he is not just in this story but what he is to you and how to accept him and so each one of these details is important and now it's not just going to say a certain man left and went and these things happen and came back it gives you his name because the name is important his name was elimelech that's the combining of two uh two words eli and malek elie eli which means my god and molek which means king his name meant my god my king so his name is giving reverence to the one true god and recognizing god as his king and the rabbis of old and even the teachers in the rabbinic tradition say that elimelech was the son of salmon who we know married rahab after the fall of the walls of jericho and so this is that that shows some significance that here this captain of the army this great general salmon who married rahab they say that one of his sons is elimelech and then it's here that in his name that using this name elimelech and using this man as an example we begin to see that him and his family begin to portray the image of or dramatize israel as a nation god had his prophets even the hosea is rife with it there's a lot of different places where god uses a a a man or uses an individual uses a situation as the image of what's happening to israel on the whole god told his prophet to go do this and why are you having me do this because it portrays what israel has done and israel has taken to themselves to whoredoms and so i'm going to cause my prophet to do this so that they can see in the image of one man the image of israel and so elimelech and his family begin to portray israel they're actually dramatizing what israel is doing so here's a man whose name means my god and my king but in judges chapter 6 verse 1 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years i want to i want to gently make this point because i even realize now i thought i was going to go further in my notes tonight than i am and so i left some quotes at home that deal with uh naomi and and them being backslid and leaving from israel but this this this verse here judges chapter 6 verse 1 speaks of how israel was doing evil in the sight of the lord and they were delivered to the hands of the midians as you continue to read this it says there was a great famine that came in the land there was a dearth that came in the land and the midianites would come and the philistines would come and they would take all their harvest and all their crops and all their fruits and they would be left without substance as a direct result of their disobedience now we can make this conclusion that elimelech wasn't necessarily this righteous very faithful prudent man who is serving god in all his ways and was just unfortunately suffering because of the sins of israel we could just assume that he was also has forsaken god and was doing evil in the sight of the lord but this is what all israel is doing at the time and i want you to see that elimelech now is going to dramatize what israel is going to do and actually foreshadow the direction that israel is headed it says in judges chapter 17 verse 6 and those days that in those days there was no king in israel there was no earthly monarch there was no man that was set over them to rule them that god told samuel that if they do this he's going to take their men i'm going to take their land and take their taxes and take their fruit in those days there was no king but every man did that which was right in his own eyes because of that i can safely say that if the bible says every man did that which was right in his own eyes then perhaps elimelech was one of those men that was doing right in his own eyes but as it says that there was no king in israel elimelech foreshadows the rejection of god israel's rejection of god as their king because here's elimelech it says my god my king but now he's going to leave bethlehem judah he's going to leave this place in the promised land and he's going to reverse the exodus and cross go right past the dead sea cross the jordan river go in the wrong direction and go right back into moab a place that god had called them through when they entered into the promised land but now they're he's going to make that journey and he does it first before israel manifests its own desire to do what reject god as their king elimelech whose name means my god and my king is going to leave israel foreshadowing that israel will reject god in first samuel chapter 8 verses 6 and 7 the people have come to samuel already and said we want a king so this kind of summarizes what samuel's response in the lord's response but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judges they didn't want judges they didn't want prophets they didn't want the way that god had been dealing with israel at the time but they said we want to be like other nations give us the king set a king over us and let him rule us and this really hurts samuel's feelings samuel took it personally and maybe this is uh a comfort to us to know that god's prophets took things personal and sometimes things happen and we take it personal and it hurts us very deeply and think oh well that that wasn't very nice or it would have been good if this happened and all well that that kind of hurts my feelings and samuel was feeling a little bit rejected and he prayed to the lord and in verse 7 and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee in others do what they said i see made very very staggering he says for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them and many of the translations say that i should not be their king and so when god uses this phrase that i should not reign over them he's saying they have not rejected you samuel as a prophet they have rejected me as their king they do not want me their god as their king it is no longer elimelech saying my god and my king but now god is being left out of it they want another man as their king and here's elimelech foreshadowing what israel would do reject god as king and so elimelech's journey into moab is an image of israel desiring to be like other nations in other countries and rejecting their king which was god and we could see that just in his name elimelech whose name would have been given patronage and honor to god as being their king we know that eventually israel no longer wants god as their king but wants an earthly fleshly monarch and that was a tendency of the flesh and it's still the same today that even and this is this is uh i guess it bears pointing out it's remarkable how that israel in doing so rejected god but yet god still lets it unfold because it portrays what the coming king jesus christ that there was going to be a king and he actually is going to allow them to choose choose saul to be their king or he's the one that's chosen to be king but then god's choice is going to be david who is a man after god's own heart who portrays and expresses these beautiful things about jesus christ that's going to come so even though in their disobedience they rejected god when they wanted an earthly king it was something that god was going to use to portray the king of kings that was going to come and it also is a reminder to us that even when it came time to choose a king that it was so easy for the people to look upon the one who was tall and had broad shoulders and the tall dark and handsome one the rich one the one who looked like he should be a king that's what israel wanted why because they judged with their eyes and they saw the prestige and the pretense or they wouldn't necessarily call it pretense they saw the prestige and the popularity and the power that came with having a king and they wanted that instead of what god offered them god was giving them a prophet well that may be a little bit controversial that may be a little bit uh there may be too much stigma associated with that that might not that may not make us look good with our neighbors and everyone else around us give us a king so we can be like everyone else and the flesh is still drawn to the things that catches the eye the flesh is still drawn to things that are popular and can be accepted more broadly and look better but when god came time for god to choose a king he didn't choose the handsome and good-looking saul he chose david who was ruddy and very very young and on the outside samuel was even like well okay i guess this is it but god warned him even as he began to choose he said man this firstborn son surely this man is king god said no man looks on the outside but i look on the inside so remember that as we go forward so the man the the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi so here's elimelech my god my king he's married to naomi which means my delight my pleasure together it could be said that god is my king and my delight and my pleasure here's a union a marriage between one who acknowledges god as king and also one who is considered my delight or pleasure the name means pleasant and in the talmud they believe that this was uh naomi was a limoulek's niece now before you get all nervous that this story came out of arkansas it was a lot different back in the day and uh and so elimelech married his brother's daughter and so he is marrying uh this would have been a limitless niece so this would have been a family that's very uh within this tribe and within this nation that's within this family a very tight family and naomi it signifies the name signifies sweet or pleasant it's very possible that she was a beautiful woman and had a very sweet nature and and and she even makes reference to it later uh how when they see her and they greet her and they call her naomi she says no no you can't call me by naomi anymore because i'm not the same one that you saw when they left and i was pondering this character naomi this week and just as you can find other characters in the bible that portray different sides and could be used with different types and naomi has obviously joined with her husband and recognized and typed with israel and in some ways has to carry the shame and the reproach uh that's associated with that type but naomi becomes a very sympathetic character because in leaving it's not suggested at all it was naomi's idea to move to moab but if we understand the traditional family and how they would have worked then and what their rights would have been associated with and how the family would have been governed and naomi just follows her husband as he departs from israel's promised land the husband desires to go and so they just the the family's just gonna go with them dad wants to go move to moab what can you do you have to follow dad to moab my husband wants to go here well then you follow your husband that's where he's going my husband wants to do this she just did what she knew would be right and pleasing in the eyes of the lord she went and so in that way perhaps we could be we could have some sympathy for naomi think oh wow man those dastardly people and elimelech and that woman naomi mai they're just awful people elimelech is responsible for his misdeeds he's responsible for the decisions he makes but what would god expect naomi to do he would expect her to obey her husband as we could see that she's a sympathetic character as he departs israel's promised land and leaving bethlehem we pointed this out last time leaving bethlehem was a clear departure and a separation from god and his blessings clearly going back into the wilderness and as they leave elimelech and and naomi they're not leaving impoverished you say well there was a famine in the land so we could think wow there's a great famine in the land maybe they left uh poor and and and broken but they didn't leave impoverished and broken when he departed with his family naomi says in uh ruth chapter 1 verse 21 i'm just going to use those first four words of that verse she says i went out full by naomi's own testimony that when he when elimelech and uh her left bethlehem judah they didn't leave poor they left full which means with abundance and so it suggests that her husband's actions and even the actions of the families they fought him were rebellious against god's program they weren't leaving because everything was broken they weren't leaving just because there was a famine but they might have been taking advantage of an opportunity sell now the market's just right or let's cut our losses and get what we have now and go and they actually take something with them and says we left out full she says i'm coming back empty but she left with abundance and here she's following and going with her husband they're leaving with abundance back into the wilderness they're not leaving alone but they're leaving with their two sons it says in the name of his two sons elimelech and his wife leave in the name of their two sons his two sons and muhlan and kill him this is where it begins to get very interesting in terms of every of the names meaning something and all these details fitting together muhlan means infirmity the name in the hebrew muslim would speak of one who is sick and weak so this is the this is the name for one that was pleasant this is the one that came from one that would seem to be strong and beautiful kill it means pining this agonizing so and it means pining or consumption and as i began to study the name it means to to waste completely so here as they're leaving this with one a son who means sick and weakly another one means consumption or fully wasted i this is this is the condition of the family as they leave with these children these are derived the names are derived from weakness and consumption and as we continue to read we won't read it tonight both seem to die young we'll find in ruth chapter 4 that muhlan was married to ruth he's the one that was married to ruth the moabitess some along was the wife of ruth and it was killian the wife of orpah and if you're reading ahead in this and you're pondering the different meanings there's a lot of things that stand out in those two characters ruth and orpah and naomi even before they depart and the story the narrative focuses more on ruth and naomi but these very sons their names speak of weakness and wasting and this narrative elimelech and naomi bringing forth a son named that is sick and a son that is wasting raises the image of adam and eve as they come towards eden as they come out of a place of god's provision and through their disobedience bring what sickness and waste and upon all of humanity and now we see elimelech and naomi with their two sons of weakness and pining and consumption and wasting leaving and leaving out of bethlehem judah and going into moab and the scripture takes care to point this out efforties of bethlehem judah why we we already read that they left from bethlehem judah but why does it stop to describe elimelech naomi mahelan and kilian why did it stop to say that these were efforties of bethlehem judah why does it remind us again that they're from bethlehem judah but this time to make reference to ephitha why would why would it tell us of this and it holds significance to the story unfolding as i've already said before it's mentioned for a reason it's mentioned so that we can slow down and ponder just these things that are in this book and how it's more than just a love story it's more than just a narrative it's something that you you're not just reading it and then you'll be quizzed later and see how much you've comprehended what you read but this efforties of bethlehem judah is to signal and raise up this thought of this connection to this place in what this place would have meant scripturally in genesis chapter 35 verses 16 to 19 is speaking of jacob and his family as they travel and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labor and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also i what a what a rejoicing for rachel at this time what a beautiful thing for her to be able to bring forth another son and she had brought forth joseph and now she is bringing forth and in hard labor to bring forth another son and we know of the hardness that rachel endured we know the difficulties that she went through and and now for her to believe that i am gonna have give a son to jacob give a son to israel she says fear not you're going to have a son and it came to pass as her soul was in departing it says for she died now think of this as they've traveled they came to the place of ephrath which was near bethel and now in this very place at this very spot on the ground as as rachel this one that was so loved by jacob as she's giving birth to another son her soul is departing her and she's going to die from childbirth it says that she called his name benoni this is what the mother called him as he's been born but his father called him benjamin so the mother his life is leaving her and she's in tormenting and she's struggling in hard labor and she's giving birth to another son to her husband through everything that she went through in this great travail and sorrow she gives birth to a son and says he's going to be called benanai but then the father gives him a different name and calls him benjamin it says and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is bethlehem here rachel think of this matriarch think of this woman there and her relationship to israel and the sons that she bore and now as she's giving birth she's going to birth this son where right there in bethlehem when she gives us she's going to die where right there in bethlehem and where is she buried right there in bethlehem and where is it that jacob mourns and places a stone upon her grave which in the bible refers she says is there to this day it was right there in bethlehem from that very spot from those very fields and that place came the cries of a mother who is dying and she gives birth to her son and as she cries out and pains and gives birth she calls his name benanim which means son of sorrow this is the son of sorrow she cries this out in bethlehem but then after the son is born and been given this name son of saul it's the father who says but to me he's going to be benjamin son of my right hand and so in one instance in one birth in a place called bethlehem as rachel his life is expired and bringing forth the sun she calls the son a man of sorrow but to the father he's going to be one that sets in his right hand and a beautiful picture of christ is painted in ephrath which is bethlehem christ is expressed in the bitterness of death isaiah 53 3 he shall be called a man of sorrows but then he's raised to what the right hand of god scripture after scripture after scripture says he is at the right hand of the father i will set you at my right hand until all your enemies be made a footstool in its expressway in ephrath which is called bethlehem what a place to see such an expression and how is it that this is and and i say this because again i i think it's just so important to recognize that this is not just well boaz boaz is kind of a nice type of of christ these are things that are placed right between judges and and joshua and placed into this placing of this book so as to understand who god is to you and how he thought of you if he had caused jacob's journey to come to this place this field and this this patch of glenn and this and this place called ephrath which is going to later be called bethlehem to cause one of such a stature of rachel to give birth to a son and then when he's dying when she's dying she calls out his name a man of sorrow but then the father says but to me he shall be the son of my right hand god is doing that to express something he's in malachi chapter 4 verses 2 to 4 it says but thou bethlehem ephrata though thou be little among the thousands of judah think of all the cities and the populations and the churches and everything that would have been judah now the prophet speaks thou bethlehem ephrata yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is born to be ruler in israel born to be ruler in israel but what is he first a man of sorrow born to sit at the right hand to be the messiah that will restore the kingdom of israel but what will he be first he'll be a man of sorrow who's going forth had been from old from everlasting therefore will he give them up until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of israel and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord and the majesty of the name of the lord his god and they shall abide for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth who is mike a prophesying of jesus christ and this is the prophecy that spoke that the messiah would come from where bethlehem he would come from bethlehem ephrata he would not come from another mighty city in judah of all the thousands that were in judah he would not come from the one that everyone would have picked he would not come from the capital city that would later be established of jerusalem he would not come from one of these other cities of refuge he would come from a no-name place as it were he would come from bethlehem but it was a place that god had marked it was a place that god had allowed benjamin to come forth for the mother and her and her and her labor to declare him to be a man of sorrow the father to reclaim that and say he will be a man of the son of my right hand god allow that to happen and then many years later he's going to allow a story to unfold of my god my king being rejected in elimelech leaving bethlehem judah going into muabai but think of the whole story that's unfolding it's still a story of redemption the hidden revelation of the book of ruth is christ and you might say well we're glad you're catching up brother here and that's so good to know so we were kind of worried about you know just exactly where you were going with this is the one that's revealed in this christ is the one that's revealed in this but how many see them they can all tell you that this is this book speaks of jesus christ and they can tell you that even that jehovah the old is jesus of the new they can tell you that christ is the redeemer he's the messiah spoke of and david prophesied of him and this prophet prophesied of him and then we can look to the new testament say it's christ that comes he's the messiah and the whole church is built upon the revelation of jesus christ and it's jesus christ that's coming in these different scriptures and these different verses everyone can pay lip service to it so when i say the hidden revelation the book of ruth christ a lot of people could say well that's not a hidden revelation but to see them is a revelation just to be able to say well that's crisis being portrayed in boaz and it's this that's being portrayed in ruth and it's actually being portrayed in written naomi people can read just like they're reading the newspaper and come to understand some knowledge but if you want to know them it's got to be a revelation and so i believe that as you read this you should desire and pray that christ would be made alive to you by revelation that i do not just want to read the book of ruth and say yes yes it speaks of jesus christ but there's christ that's hidden in the word and the christ that's hidden in the word i want revealed to me someone can tell you that in this picture somewhere is hidden the bobcat and you could just trust him that it's in there and someone say do you know what's hidden that picture he said yeah bobcat because the very title of it says hidden bobcat in this picture somewhere is a bobcat and you can believe that there's a bobcat in there somewhere i believe it's in there and someone can tell you i've seen it it's in there and everyone can say yeah christ is in the book of ruth christ is in the book of ruth but what happens when you look at that picture and you see it for yourself what happens when it's quickened to you and revealed to you and you see it there's it's something different than someone telling you and what is it you do and someone wants to say there's a bobcat in there and it's right you're like no don't show me now i want to see it for myself and that's how we ought to be with everything that's in the word of god i don't want just somebody explaining it to me and telling me and trying to tell me this is how it is and you better believe it and you knuckleheads better just believe it and you better just believe it i want to see it for myself it's not enough you just take it from my word and just believe what brother aaron's trying to tell you no see what god's trying to show you i'd much rather you leave here with the revelation direct from god than understanding a word i said well i might not have seen what you were seeing brother here and but god showed me something very special god showed me something very supernatural i'll be honest i've had times i've preached what i thought was very inspired very anointed and thought i'd seen things and you're done and god blesses the service and someone comes up and says that service was amazing i can't believe what you brought out that was tremendous how this is what i saw and i'm going yeah that's exactly what i meant exactly what i meant siri please take a note i mean because it's like wow the things that god wants to reveal to you the things that he wants you to see the hidden revelation of the book of ruth all the nominal christians cry it's christ it's christ but i want to see him i want to see him in every verse i want to see him not just for what he is in this story but what he is to me and how to accept him and let me say this the hidden revelation of the book of ruth is christ but not just christ but also his bride because you just brother brown says not just see what he is in that story but what he is to you and how to accept him and so if you understand what he is to you it tells you what you are if he reveals your himself to you as bridegroom what would that tell you your bride that would have to be the necessary conclusion if he's wanting to reveal himself to you as bridegroom that's a man that's about to be married then that tells me that i am part of this bride this body that is going to be married to christ it is in the revealing of christ that that imparts to you his attributes and characteristics when he reveals himself to you as a healer what does that make you healed when he reveals himself to you as deliverer what does that make him to you make you delivered when he reveals himself to you what he is to you it has something to do with you recognizing who you are and a lot of it maybe as part of it is accepting him but another part is accepting what he's made us accepting who we are and that'll become a very key part later on when it comes to the exchange between ruth and boaz and then even the exchange that takes place between ruth and naomi in naomi's ultimate declaration she came to understand that she was not just a moabitess she was not just the widow of muhammad she was more than that but she was now redeemed and so the hidden revelation of the book of ruth is not just i i say that very delicately not just christ but maybe not just the part of christ we're thinking but also his bride as we mentioned before elimelech's dad was salmon salmon was a descendant descendant of judah through tamar now i've said this and even it was beautiful for me as i'm working through it the connections already made before we ever get to boaz right but look at now who eliminate is look what would be represented in this family of of judah and even tamar and the story of how they would go back into moab and come back naomi would come back by herself with ruth without the men without the men of the family without elimelech without her two sons because the revelation is not just of christ but of his bride in matthew chapter 1 verses 1 to 6 the book of the generation of jesus christ that's pretty pretty thick language the book of the generation of jesus christ notices the designations the son of david the son of abraham so when it's it's telling us the story the book the book of the generation of jesus christ is going to begin by first calling him the son of david and then also the son of abraham and so there's going to be a connection of abraham he is the son of abraham and he's also the son of david and it gives us these generations and these begettings abraham begat isaac where does it begin with abraham our sunday school class is beginning with abraham in a new in a new lesson here recently to teach him about abraham and we were fellowshipping on it uh the other day our families together with the sunday school teachers i believe his sister jennifer was sharing it and and i just expressed how it's a perfect place to begin because really in the book of genesis it's a really quick race to try to get to abraham i mean look at creation i mean look at creation now and to think that god covered it in just a few verses and even the fall of bands covered very quickly and their banishment from the garden covered very quickly and the fall of man covered very quickly and the flood very quickly and they didn't know why because it's just these first 10 11 chapters are all trying to set the stage so god came god spoke to abram that's when the story begins the first part is setting the scene it's telling us it's like to say that there was a famine in the land and the time of the book of judges and a certain man of bethlehem judah left with his wife and two sons that's what genesis 1 to 11 is trying to say this is the setting for a man named abram so you can understand where abram comes from and what he's doing so now when the story begins to be told about jesus christ it begins with this generations beginning with abraham it says abraham beget isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat judah and his brethren and judah beget faires and zara of tamar now kesha this is the first it's the first mention of a woman and there has began esron and sram begat aram should i switch mics that didn't work all right let's start over ruth chapter one this sounds better anyways let's just start ruth chapter one well we'll start we'll back up a little bit it is judah that begets two sons of tamar through these sons of tamar that's the lineage now that's coming on down to where nassan begat salmon now in verse five notice how salmon begat boaz of rahab this is the second woman that's mentioned in the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david and the son of abraham and tamar now rahab and boaz begat obed of ruth and this is where the story is now you begin to realize well of course this is a very important story this story is revealing to us more than just a love story but now we see that it comes to this uh this spot where you have boaz who's birthed by rahab and it's that same bow as who's beget oh bed of ruth through ruth came obed and old obed beget jesse jesse beget david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of uriahs oh and what a incredible recitation as you would continue to read you'd find that these are the four women before you get to marry that are mentioned in the lineage of jesus christ and we can say what is the mystery of tamar rahab ruth and the wife of uriah bathsheba every single one of these women are gentiles every single one they were not of the land of the of the jews they were not part of the tribe of judah but these are ones that are brought in under extraordinary circumstances and tamar how she so desired to have a son of her own and to give seed to her husbands and even how she played the part with judah to make sure that there was seed of judah that would be come from her that would be conceived of her and to continue the lineage of judah and then you have the story of samoan taking who the harlot of jericho the one who had the secret of the two spies that came into her home and it's through her that begets the further lineage of one boaz who's going to take to him the wife of ruth who is the moabitess and then it continues to where she in her lineage from jesse comes david who is the king and then his son solomon is the one that's born of bathsheba the mystery that's being contained in the book of ruth is not just jesus christ but that he's going to have a gentile bride that's the mystery of god that's a mystery that had been declared to all the prophets it's the mystery that's still hidden to a lot of people today when they look into the word of god and say oh the mystery of god's going to be finished they don't recognize that the very mystery of god that was been preserved not just with christ but that christ would have a gentile bride that was a mystery that came together and so despite naomi's coming heartache and bitterness and loss they feel like they're leaving a pretty bad situation there's famine this the indicators don't look good to the housing market there's a there's a recession coming on and it doesn't look good for the economies let's get out of here while we can let's make this decision let's let's move and let's let's take what we have and let's leave out full and we'll come back eventually we're just doing this for a season we know what's coming we know elimelech is going gonna die we know when he's dead that their two sons are gonna despise even the long i'm going to marry two moabites women those two sons are gonna die and despite the coming heartache and loss for naomi god had a greater plan for all of it god knows just exactly how to allow things to happen for he's going to get the glory and his story is going to be the one that's told no matter what people try to do no matter how they may try to attack it no they may try to malign it try to take ownership of it make it their own pain make it their own story or make it all about them god has a way of bringing it around to where it's all about him it's his story and i've had this statement that i wanted to read it's very lengthy and we'll and we're going to close with this i'm just going to read to you several paragraphs of why little bethlehem was preached in 1963 december 14th of 1963 why little bethlehem and it was preached here in phoenix and brother brown begins in paragraph 42 and and if you could just follow me i think we might uh i know you don't trust me at this point in this regards but i think we might actually be short tonight uh but in paragraph 42 it says man had been fixing a place for the king to be born there was more greatest religious places and historical places for the king instead of this little bethlehem because they had been looking forward to the messiah and they had it in their minds even these scriptures said the messiah will come suddenly to the temple and all these different prophecies so they had it fixed in their mind just exactly how he would be and where he would be places for instance like shiloh shiloh was where the ark was pitched first we know as we come across the jordan to this side in palestine and where the ark was set up for its first place of worship worship place or gilgal zion zion a great place gilgal also and we'll skip a little bit because he begins to describe jerusalem some he says and when he did when he set it up instead of them fixing him a place at jerusalem this kingdom that was later this city that was later set up by david it became such a central point to their religion a central point to israel he didn't fix it put him in a place of jerusalem or one of these great historical spots he was born in bethlehem the smallest of all the cities art thou not least among the princes of judea but out of these shall come a governor that shall rule my people and this great proud jerusalem and all the other cities were rejected or maybe they could took some of the places places of refuge the great place like hebron kedus or ramoth gilead one of those great refuge cities because he was to be our refuge if we would like to try to fix in our own mind we might have took say well now if this great king coming which will be our refuge he should be born in one of these great memorial places of a refuge like ramoth gilead or kadosh kedis or one of those he's getting into the mind of the people like if god's gonna be somewhere if god's gonna have a king where would he come from where would he be what would he identify himself with if we're trying to recognize the fingerprints of god if we're wanting to believe that god is moving if you want to understand that god is behind something he's saying that we have a way of judging things we have a metrics that we use and we have statistics and models that we go by to determine whether we believe this is the word of god or we believe this is the move of god and these are the things that go on he says we would have tried to fix it like that in our minds that's what we would have tried it would have to be jerusalem this great city of jerusalem the place where solomon built the temple the place that david established the kingdom this would have to be the place the messiah would come or maybe one of these great historical places but it's little bethlehem he says but you see god has other ways of doing things he knows how to do things right and now by the mind of god and the help of god we try to say why that this happened because everything works just exactly right in god's great program this is how he said and now by the mind of god and the help of god brother branham is wanting to express this by the mind of god and the help of god i want to express to you why this happened he's wanting to cat for the people to catch why did god choose bethlehem why did he choose that city why did he choose that place and then he makes it even more personal as he says because everything works according to god's great program he says and i want you people here at phoenix and around to try to get this i believe we could take that personal those who are visiting from outside of phoenix tonight he'll be like well thank you we're good he says the people around here at phoenix and around to try to get this what is it he wants them to get that remember that god knows what he's doing and he takes simple means to do it by because if he does something by some great outstanding something then god never does things like that he never did it in all the history of the bible god never did deal never did it any time take any group of people to do anything god takes an individual what does that mean there's not one church or one organization or any kind of move that can tell you that they are the bride because the bride is made up of individuals it will not be a dot-com it will not be an ink it will not be an organization it will not be a mantra not be something you can carry a card for he says when god does something it's not an organization it's not something big it's not something outstanding in the eyes of the world god never does something like that god never did deal any time take any group to do anything god takes an individual you are the one you one person and god never changes his program because in his first program he must always remain with that program and this is why we could say that the book one of the reasons why we can say the book of ruth is so outstanding because it doesn't reveal what god is to a church it doesn't reveal what god is to a people it doesn't reveal what god is to some organization it reveals what god is in that story and what he is to you it's to the individual and how you can receive them and you're not being received because you go to the right church you're not being received because you're part of the right kind of program in the world you're being received because as an individual you see what he is to you god takes an individual because that's his first program he must always remain with that program now skip a little bit to paragraph 47 just a little bit and now when israel came over the river of jordan now try to catch this when israel crossed over into the land brother iran's wanting you to understand why little bethlehem what does it represent what does it signify to us the promised land there was a gentile woman that we know is rahab the harlot and she asked for mercy and she received mercy she received mercy as long as she stayed under the scarlet cord and that's the only way she could have mercy it was a sign a token that was given her we have a token today also and we're safe as long as we stay under our scarlet cord the blood of jesus christ as an individual not a group an individual we must we each must stay under that scarlet cord of the blood of jesus christ as an individual i realized um that many times when a minister or pastor preaches he has to be the partaker first of what he's going to be speaking to the people and ministering on pure joy and being numb and and feeling and having some feeling uh what i've what i've reaped from that is i felt very very uncomfortable over the last couple weeks a lot of different things making me feel uncomfortable a lot of things maybe making me feel unsettled and i realize well i'm feeling maybe these are things that this is the way things have been and i i haven't been feeling this and i need to i need to know how god uses these feelings and these emotions to understand them and as i was processing it today and thinking about how i was feeling and wanting to recognize this connection as god deals with my heart and many times he deals with you i'll say this as a pastor he'll deal with your heart and you'll feel something and you think oh oh i didn't know oh and then you realize oh oh now i know that it's god dealing with your heart for someone else's benefit he's dealing he's giving you the feelings he's walking you through paces he's causing you to experience something for my own growth absolutely from my own personal experience so i could be closer with christ yes but then also to to be able to help you to understand what you're going through to find things in the word of god to study and pray and then bring something out that can address those very things that god has given you the experience and the burden of for the people's benefit and when brother branham says here that he comes to an individual and he says that we have the token today and he says as an individual not a group an individual i think we should all be honest with ourselves how that we have this this part of us that wants to be able to blend into the crowd and find safety in numbers and be able to say well i can't be wrong because look at so many other people that think the same thing and or well i i don't know what's right and i'm not sure what to do so i'm just gonna follow the crowd i just want someone to tell me what to do and and whatever headquarters says to do we'll do it and what everyone else is doing we're gonna do it and then you just kind of follow in that line and you kind of just go along with the crowd and go along with the group and everyone has this mob mentality and we feel very safe and comfortable within a message construct and these message structures and these ideas and these traditions and the way things are done and we rest not in a personal experience with jesus christ but in the structure that the church has provided the structure that our family has followed and told the line with and we think all the tokens apply to my home my family's applied the token the church has applied the token everyone's done it but listen you won't get by as a part of a group move or a church move you're going to get by by having an individual personal experience with jesus christ and he emphasizes this as to the individuals to the individual why little bethlehem just a solitary single little city because it was a message to the individual brother branham identifies rahab as being one of the things i want the people here at phoenix to try to get this god has a way of doing things i hope that god can help me he says and try to try to get you to see why this happened and he begins with rahab and then this rahab after she was spared she got all her people in everything that was under the cord was saved just like when god in egypt when all was under the blood was saved all was under the scarlet cord was saved and all under the blood of jesus is saved all from out from under it is lost and ready for destruction then we understand by history that she was courted by some general and he uses he comes to the name here in a moment but as he's saying he goes i don't know his name right now in the israeli army and she finally married this man they settled up here in this near this little place and her son salmon was one who founded bethlehem but he's coming through the connection rahab in salmon and salmon found bethlehem see a gentile is connected with it to begin with a gentile rahab the harlot why little bethlehem what's this revelation in the book of ruth that once you see it you'll wonder why you ever went over the top but what's this hidden revelation that when you see it it'll bring you really close to god not a story of a redeeming redeemer to israel to this day a rabbi or a jew could take you and twist you up and use the scripture and and reject the new testament tell you why jesus wasn't the messiah and and even be able to convince you scripturally how that they are god's chosen people and the messiah is going to come to them and we as believers have to say well you know you're right he is going to reveal himself to you again and recognize their place in the scripture and the prophecies to them but it's not just christ the kinsmen of israel but it's christ who in the beginning called abram not a jew but a gentile called him out from among the nations and said i would make you great and would give him a seed and the seed would be christ and then we have the special connection with christ that we are not just brought in after the fact because israel rejected it but god in the beginning knew god in the beginning knew that israel would reject him why so he could bring in his truly beloved the bride of christ a gentile and that's why he allows these things to happen even in the story of ruth but a gentiles connected it within the beginning rahab the harlot it says now we find out that salmon founded this city little city of bethlehem and he begat boaz and boaz the one who married ruth another gentile and we are following this lineage now ruth she was a moabite and she married boaz and came into this little city just in barley season and he says oh if we had the time this morning till on that i'd owe my wife six dresses afterwards it's because at the beginning he's having a conversation with his wife and he said i'm going to be out at 10 o'clock and she looked at me and said if i'm not out and she looked at me and i said if i'm not out by 10 o'clock i'll buy you three new dresses of your choice so what's going to happen i owe her three dresses right now because it's 20 till 10 now but i'll try to hurry as quick as possible i didn't make any promises about dresses so i'm not worried about the getting to 8 30 or even 10 for that matter but he says if i and i mentioned that just to show that this is something that brother brown when he got oh if we had time this morning why because there's a hidden revelation in the book of ruth that ruth came in the barley season in the harvest time oh if he could dwell on the fact that this gentile woman is coming in the time of a barley harvest he says i would go so long i told my wife six dresses how to dwell on that subject and he just kind of gives us some breadcrumbs some little highlights naomi naomi representing the orthodox church was went away on the account of a famine went over into the land of moab like the scattering of israel all out among the nations and then as she came back she brought back ruth the moabite and she returned just in barley's season just the gathering in of the first barley that is that gentile church coming to god just at barley season again the gospel had already went to the gentiles the gentiles were already being made up through seven church ages but now brother branham sees a truth that's portrayed in the book of ruth he sees the truth and why little bethlehem why little bethlehem because bethlehem judah at the beginning held the mystery of a gentile wife held the mistress of a gentile bride he says that gentile bride coming to god again at barley season at harvest time it speaks of the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so as we begin to read this and go forward you'll see that in each juncture there's a type for you as an individual and as it relates to the bride he says what a beautiful picture there and then she and boaz married and their famous son obad was begotten there and also born and then his great son jesse came from obed there also he begat david his son the king david came out what a story what incredible story look at this coming up now from rahab the harlot her son founding it from that came boaz which brought in another gentile and then from boaz came jesse and here jesse to jesse was born david and david right here at this same little bethlehem was anointed by the prophet of god to be the king of israel all these spiritual things hid from the eyes of the world what was happening here in this little city of bethlehem see that's the way god does it's not always the big flashy ornamental things says now i trust that the holy spirit will be present now to give you correct understanding that god doesn't work out on these big things is by the spirit that's what you need for yourself individually if there's young people here that are going to camp out this weekend and brother wayne lawson was expressing as fellowshipping with him today i just expressed in his his burden his desire to see god moving a very special way for young people recognizing the need that every young person must come to a new birth experience that they've got to have that baptism of the holy ghost they got to have it for themselves individually and this is where i would say this for anyone who's going to youth camp don't nest don't be looking for some great big move or something big and flashy be looking for him to reveal himself to you make sure it's personal and not just to get caught up in something big or if something big doesn't happen what's big is if he reveals himself to you i don't need a show i don't need something fantastic i don't need a chairs being lifted in the air and things dramatic happening i need god to open up my heart i need god to open up my mind i need him to speak to me right where i'm at at the time that i'm living god doesn't work out on these big things it's by the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord god working in the spirit among the people see these great backgrounds he could only come to this city that's the only place he could be born god following his same line god always does that god follows the line of his word he cannot go back on his word by no means and then remain god he's got to stay with the word he can never leave that today our traditions and so forth take us from the word it's okay if you get checked by that it's okay to ponder that so brother aaron we've left denominations we're in the message now we do everything by church order and this is how we do things and this is what we believe no we should examine ourselves right we should be sure that our cod isn't the result of ocd right and we should be conscious of that we should be aware that no this isn't by tradition this isn't by you know being obsessive-compulsive this isn't because we want things to be strict and because we like the anti and the message no we examine ourselves it's not by tradition we don't want tradition to take us from the word we have creeds and things we inject into the word which pollutes the whole thing but god can never leave the line of his word his word is true always because he is the word and god and his word is the same now we see here how this little bethlehem yet being unnoticed a little place not noticed too much to the outside world just the smallest of the cities nobody paid any attention to it be it god had in his purpose that that's where all these things would happen and make this personal he says now the spiritual mind would pick that up because the prophet said here you see the prophet said thou bethlehem of judea art thou not the least among the princes but out of these shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel the prophet the mind of the prophet found it watch those spiritual holy spirit today leading those things don't make any difference what the world says in all of its tinsel watch the holy spirit in the word that's where it come don't get distracted by the world in all its tinsel he says watch the holy spirit in the word that's where it comes why little bethlehem because god had chosen it he'd already laid the framework for it it had to be there if they'd caught the hidden revelation in that book of ruth it had to be there if they caught the revelation of benjamin benoni being born to rachel it had to be there because from there would come the messiah bethlehem let's stand amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer i invite you if you have a need just to lift your hand before the lord and [Music] request his favor with our heads bowed let's pray our gracious heavenly father [Music] we thank you so much for the grace that you have for us your goodness lord as i have been reading in this book of ruth it's been my prayer that i would not only see what you are in the story but what you are to me and how to accept you not as a personal savior again as we many of us have already experienced that not in the new birth which is that seal of the holy ghost but what you can be to us in totality how you can continue to provide and give strength and courage and even to see how ruth went from resting to rewarded that we know that if we have received this baptism of the holy ghost which is our rest that there comes a reward [Music] that we want to live like believers who know that you're a rewarder that you're a provider that you're a keeper that you're a deliverer [Music] and i would desire that the image that we see in the book of ruth is that you will make provision for that one that is cast down that one that it seems to be helpless the one that is without hope that there is provision there is a way lord in the very direct and simple thought is we just took part of one verse tonight the man name was elimelech and his wife naomi and his two sons milan and killian apritheese of bethlehem judah it told the story lord who they were it pointed to the origin of bethlehem it pointed to the destiny of bethlehem it pointed to what would take place in bethlehem and lord may our origin story change tonight [Music] may we no longer be tethered to our birth date may we no longer be tethered to natural events the lord may we see ourselves as being in you before the foundation of the world may our origin story be divine just as it was for bethlehem may our origin story and our destiny be just as divine as it was for bethlehem i pray father you strengthen us and encourage us be with us lord help us to face the challenges that are before us lord as we may begin to feel a little uncomfortable and we're challenged with different notions and ideas and rejections and fears and complexes lord may we lean more heavily upon you and flee to you trust in you not necessarily away from the pain but to the purpose of it to the meaning of it lord we run to you bless all those that have gathered tonight take the pray that you take this word that has been shared or even through my discomfort or through my stumblings lord just seal it up in a beautiful way in the people's hearts that they would be benefited by it we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
