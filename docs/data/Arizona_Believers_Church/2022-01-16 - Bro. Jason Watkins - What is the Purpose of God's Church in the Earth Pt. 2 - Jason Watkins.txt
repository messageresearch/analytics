TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen god bless your friends god bless you good to see you amen again in the house of the lord uh we're going to go to hebrews chapter 12. sorry to get that to you brother john hebrews 12. paul is going to draw a stark contrast between what israel faced at sinai and where what we are called to today i certainly enjoyed my time this morning and i just can tell you that i felt so at home here brother aaron uh gives me such a spirit of freedom and liberty just to be me and uh and i just felt like i was at home amen so just a relaxing time for me in the word i feel that same exact way again uh that okay with you or does relaxing be myself amen praise god i sure have enjoyed our time here in arizona and all the fellowship of all the friends amen saints of light precious faith nothing like it amen so god bless you we're going to carry on this afternoon in our thought about the purpose of the church of god in the earth and we'll be taking part two whoops wrong app we'll be taking part two of that and just trying to pick up here we're going to begin in verse uh did i say 20 yes um 22. so paul let me just quickly capture your minds we got a lot of ground to cover and i i i'm going to go at a at a an even pace this evening because i think that you're going to realize here especially if you were if you were able to be here this morning you're going to see that this morning was just a foundation to get to this amen so we're looking to do that and we're just going to move into it and let the lord set the pace for us amen so paul here is going to draw this sharp contrast to those who met him at sinai you remember the mountain's on fire and the sight of him even moses said even i quake and tremble and the people you know recoiled they here god went to all this to get them there and sent moses and brought them out and it was everything was to come to this mountain that's what god told moses you're going to go to pharaoh and you're going to say let my people go and when you get them you're going to bring them back here and i'm going to talk to them and i'm going to make a covenant with them and you know everybody loved the sound of that but uh you know it's kind of like john you know when he ate the book it was sweet in his mouth but in his belly my goodness you know to brother branham said it it's sweet in your mouth but when the persecution comes and the rejection comes and the trials come and the tribulation because you know you don't have the greatest battle ever fault you think you got battles become a christian one time say oh i thought being christian may a flowery bed thing but it's just the opposite of that you actually start the greatest battle ever fought because now you're a target of the enemy and so you know but just remember as i made a comment to you this morning this life is not about this life please remember that it's about the next one and this is we're here as a we're going to rule and reign with him as kings so our training days are now amen we've got to learn say what i got to learn you got to learn to take god at his word you got to learn to say amen to every word no matter what it costs no matter what the cost is you got to say i value god's word above everything amen god values his word above his own name the bible shows us and because his name was progressively you know his name constantly uh gave was given new names to show the progression but the word is never changing the word is unfailing and so his word is his is the original seed so if you miss if you miss the word for your day call him by whatever name you want it's pointless it's an exercise in futility because you've missed the key you've missed the most important thing and that is that his word is a seed that brings forth of its kind all right so paul is trying to get the church here uh these hebrews which were his countrymen he's trying to get them to understand you think that that was something back there you talk about sinai all the time i talked about it too i was a pharisee the pharisees well i'm about to tell you you're called to something much grander and greater and in some ways more terrifying than that see all right so he says watch this so you not been called to that verse 22 verse 21 and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye now watch him ye are come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels isn't that eye-opening i mean you just thought you just were here and had a job and took vacations raised kids and lived a life no no you know oh that it were that simple but life here your life has much greater meaning behind it you need to own that that's what preaching is about to get you to own your position in christ and take responsibility for it see because the lord is counting on you brother branham taught us very clearly it's right off the tape he said there are some things that god will not do he's looking for you to do it see he's going to do it through you but he's looking for you to do it all right so but you're not but you're not called moses said i exceedingly fair and quake but year come unto mount zion and under the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem i mean wake up and smell the coffee you've come to an innumerable company of angels you're not just here living out a meandering life to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the god the judge and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect i mean you want to just go wow and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel so it's not the blood of abel called for vengeance so this is a better covenant than that this isn't calling this is calling for grace see and so see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth now he's going to go out pick up haggai's prophecy in haggai chapter 2. and now brother branham's going to come in world falling apart and world is again falling apart remember those both of those messages and brother branham's going to come to hebrews 12 and and show you haggai's prophecy in hebrews 12 and say that this is now this is what's happening haggai's prophecy is right now paul picked it up to the hebrews and you're living it all right and whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more somewhere in the future there you read the book of revelation and it talks about a prophet from the future and there's going to be a prophet from the future who's going to appear to john and so much so christ like john will mistakenly try to worship him and he'll have to stop him two or three times say don't do that i'm only one of thy brethren the fellow prophets we're here to worship god and so this prophet from the future arrived in our day and so he's identifying now that what paul was saying some this is coming haggai said this is coming paul picks it up and said yes amen this is coming and a prophet elijah stands in this day and says now it's here what's here watch and and whose voice then shook the heaven but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more this phrase signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of the things that are made here's why he does it that those things we don't always like our lives to be shaken amen shaking isn't fun see but here's why he does it that those things which cannot be shaken may remain now the only thing that can't be shaken or moved is the word and that's in you and god's reducing you to everything but that amen that's what's happening in our lives he's reducing you to his word all right and your your compliance or resistance to that will turn will decide the smoothness sailing of your life or the rough seas it's up to you all right now wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved isn't that a great accomplishment so at least you have you you should you should love it because you can say well then i'm gonna receive a kingdom all right this is the reward a kingdom that cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire that can be good or bad depending on which side you're on all right so to to egypt that pillar of fire was a thick darkness that scared them but to the israel it was light and showed the way across the red sea all right so but either way it consumes so it's going to it's either going to consume everything off of you that god wants off of you but if you resist it'll start consuming you because he's not going to lose brother branham taught us that that when he saw his image face down in genesis he said he he he he wasn't he wasn't content to see his creation laying there ruined because he's god and he won't be defeated and so he started building back and he's building now he's almost finished and here we are oh man all right let god bless the reading of his word as you are seated so this is a kingdom that cannot be moved i've been preaching at home a number of sermons and got quite a few more to go uh on on the kingdom and and so it looks like the lord's gonna force me into some uh areas that i've not even got to at home maybe we'll see i'm not sure how it's going to go tonight but but so brother branham comes here in the world falling apart now he's going to he's going to make it clear that this kingdom that paul is referencing that god is perfecting you for it's it's happening in real time right now and brother branham says what are we looking for friends this is what the world falling apart april 1963. what what are we looking for friends what are we the real church now how many are the real church the real church so remember i'm preaching on the purpose of the church in the earth all right the real church is looking not for denomination not looking for a president not looking for a genius to rise up so i i couldn't care less whether trump wins the white house back i know i have a republican suit on but i couldn't care less if trump wins reelection or if sleepy joe carries on it's immaterial to me because they're not in control of anything prophecy as we prove to you today prophecy is in control of everything so i want to look at the right i want to look at the right barometer i want to look at prophecy see and so the real church is looking not for a denomination not looking for a president not looking for a genius to rise up but they're looking for a kingdom and a king to come what is the kingdom it's on earth now it's a spirit mystical body of christ are you in it the good thing about it is friends think of this before we get to this kingdom in a millennium meaning in a millennium before we get to this kingdom before this king comes now we can sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus already see in christ jesus lifted up above all the shadows all the corruption of the world all their television programs all these other nonsense they got on the earth today all their rotten pollution and systems and everything be lifted up in heavenly places and the holy spirit himself come upon us and speak out and call to us our sins and tell us how to get straightened up and what we've done in life and what we're doing isn't that what we want i mean listen jesus said that the children who love darkness they don't want to come to the light because it exposes their sin to themselves they don't want to face who they really are by the child of god that's exactly what we want to know i want to know if i'm wrong i want to know if i'm not pleasing to him i want to be ex i want to be exposed to me now i don't want to be exposed to you but i want to be exposed to me i want to know when i look in the mirror of god's word that god is pleased with my life and his kingdom is now right now being established in the hearts of his people here on earth so it's all about a kingdom there there i'll make this statement to you there is there is a if you have a kingdom then then our lives if we're headed for a kingdom of god and we're of god then our lives ought to have kingdom order our marriages should have kingdom order there's a kingdom order to marry there's a right way and the wrong way there's a kingdom order and a not kingdom order all right there are our our our teenagers should be living kingdom order our churches should have kingdom order our preaching should have kingdom order our finances should have kingdom order because we're children of the king and we we don't have to wait for a millennium we that's what brother madam is excited about by the holy ghost you can go ahead and start enjoying the benefits of the kingdom what benefit is it to to have kingdom power because that means i have authority over the devil i have authority in my home over the devil over my children over the devil see he can't get to them because i have a kingdom order set in place see so we are a seed of god we are a light seed brother branham talks about how that you know he he references a narrative about this this darkness and he says but he says in in the in the vision he he sees uh i think it's a vision he had or someone was telling him a dream and he says but every once in a while you'd see a little streak of light going through that darkness he said that's a child of god see and so we're we're a we're a light seed and so here we are a multi-cultural race of people uh and and we're made of a different material than the sons of men we're sons of god see and so we find that that we're made of a material that doesn't buckle down to the god of this age because you're kingdom material you've got a light seed inside of you see we finished today concluded our we we hit the pause button today making the point that god has dropped you down in the middle of the darkest age ever to shine the light to show the world the deception that they've misunderstood who god is they've misunderstood what the new birth is they've misunderstood what he expects out of mankind and we're here to let our light shine to set the record straight to be the final testimony see to be the final voice we're not brother god doesn't need you or me to go and redo the shout i don't need to redo brother branham's message brother branham doesn't come back doesn't need to come back and redo it you understand about that we're we're what is our job now to become that shout behind skin to be the living word see and so so we find that we're we're the material that we're made of in this kingdom this mystical union we don't buckle down to the god of this age because that's a different kingdom we don't march to that kingdom we i'm not from here i'm from above see i'm an emissary from i said to you today that's our mission is to be in the earth and represent brother branham said we represent the the the the life of our rebirth see which is in heaven i'm not here to act like laodicea i'm act i'm here to demonstrate the life of my rebirth amen and be a light to the world and so we finally say well but i but i'm elected but i'm but i'm the elected child of god well first of all you've got to remember that brother branham taught us that it's not the man that comes predestinated it's the seed in him because there's only one elected son isaiah 42 1. there's only one elected son in the world ever in history that's christ say well then how am i elected because i was in him i come from him i go back to him i'm part of him and life is life seed of the seed word of his word life of his life that's what that's we are elected in christ see and so so we realize friends that that there's only one man that is leaving in the translation when the dead in christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up we'll be changed in a moment there's only one man leaving here and that's the full man christ that's you in the full complete image the full man in the image of christ that's the people going in the rapture see because we come to his very image and these elements can't be held in this dimension any longer brother branham says in sirs we would see jesus sir we would see jesus that's the only way the gospel of salvation that's the only way to be the gospel of salvation the gospel of deliverance the full gospel for the full man for the full son for the full daughter paradox 1965 you've got to come back to the entire full gospel it was made for the full man by a complete god see so so not a part of him uh you know it's not a part of him taking in a rapture but brother branham said he's not coming for a deformed bride you know that's not made up in his very image he's coming for a full complete image of his bride which is the image of the word amen this is jesus christ and so it's a bride in his very image the in the fullness of him thousands of lived voices echoing amen in our daily lives do you have an amen in your daily life a man means more than mental assent means more than i agree with the theology it means that whatever the word calls for me in my life i say amen whatever the sacrifice whatever i got to give up whatever got to change if i got to change friends change jobs change locations change careers change whatever got to change i will say amen to the word of god see and so so we realize then that there's only one race leaving the earth before the tribulation sets in and that's the christ race the the light seed of god those who have surrendered their lives to kingdom order all right because we're we're looking for a king and we have his kingdom right now in the earth so naturally there's a kingdom order all right so the rapture then then you say well then then put the rapture in simple terms in the context of your sermon tonight it's easy to do the rapture is when god has all the pieces perfectly formed all the pieces brought into their position in christ then all the pieces are assembled suddenly and taken off the earth see the rapture's not god sprinkling pixie dust on you or waving a magic wand over you you know this is an assemblage this is this is god bringing all of his elements together into his order and so you you and this is a double negative i get it you can't not go in the rapture you will go in the rapture your body will change see you are going in the rapture as you believe this word you are going in the rapture and there's nothing you can do about it i love saying that amen so then there should be a kingdom order to all of this every facet of our lives would you agree with me have i made a scriptural case to show you this is a kingdom coming there's a kingdom now and that calls for kingdom order kingdom faith see kingdom obedience kingdom action kingdom reaction which is generally always what gets us in more trouble than our actions christians rarely get in trouble by their actions because they live sanctified lives it's more often our reactions that get us in trouble see but we've got to bring our spirit subject to the word of god bringing every thought subject people sometimes can't do that and they suffer from double mindedness is their problem and their faith is weak and when that happens you just look in the in the circle of your life and you'll be unstable in nearly every part of it when you when you can't when you can't say amen to every word and bring your spirit and your flesh and your mind subject to the thoughts of god and agree with god's word you're double-minded see because if you were really sure that it was true you'd adopt it see but you're you're you you realize god is leading you in one direction and you're trying to go in another you're determined to go in a different direction and i'm here to tell you god won't have it god won't have it he has ways all right has ways and means he'll need a ways and means committee he is the committee so you know there's this kingdom order in our life and there's a kingdom order in our service to the lord every facet of our lives and i can just tell you now without following you around without you know hiring a spy company to fly a drone over you and track your movements without talking to your pastor without doing anything without bugging your phone or tapping anything i can already tell you one aspect of your life for sure that satan is moving in your life trying to move in your life right now whether it might be a job a career an education a friendship a relationship habits you know what whatever satan is doing everything he can to pull you off of the kingdom path he will put everything in your life he'll put people he'll put careers he'll put finances he'll put he'll put opportunities in your way and and his just remember friends that when satan gives you a thought you teenagers remember this please when satan get puts a thought in your mind you just remember this there's a plan behind that he doesn't run around willy-nilly just trying to whisper thoughts into your head he has a plan that if he can get you to act on what you heard then he has a plan to pull you off of your path to a kingdom because then he robs you of kingdom power robs you of all the victory he satan remember satan doesn't care how religious you are and he doesn't even care this is how audacious he is he doesn't care that you come to this church he doesn't care that you're under a seasoned ministry he doesn't care how right you are in your doctrine because he knows a secret that if he can cause you to miss that life of the holy spirit and living according to the to the dictates of the holy spirit trying to lead you then he knows he'll win in the end anyhow you won't come up see and so so you realize friends you know you you have you you're going to take a journey i i heard a brother friend of mine give this example it meant so much to me it's it's noteworthy and worth repeating that you know when you're going to take a journey and you're going to catch a train and you've got all these brochures and all of these things and you're you're looking at where i'm going my when i get there it's going to be so beautiful and i'm going to have such a good time and i'm going to take a vacation and it's going to be grand and i'm going to have memories and you're you're excited just looking at the brochures and and but somehow you get on the journey and the train's going to take you there if you just stay on it but sometimes you get impatient you look out the window you see something oh i just need to jump off for a minute and you know what happens people get impatient they jump off the train and the train heads on and you're just left with a brochure and you're wondering where's all the victory where was all this that i was promised well you're you're impatient you didn't let god work it out because the the point is you're going somewhere i think i made that case effectively today you're going somewhere your life isn't an accident there's no accidents there's only god sides in your life there's no accidents there's only god sides in the life of his family we're headed somewhere all right so hebrews 12 and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel so it's going to speak of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the like the blood of abel did all right so verse 28 wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved see so let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably because our god with godly fear because he's a consuming fire so this means that all creation will be shaken and removed so that only unshakeable things will remain since we are receiving a kingdom that is unshakable then let us live a life of grace let us be thankful let us please god by worshiping him in holiness and righteousness why because we are we're being we're becoming part of a kingdom which cannot be moved haggai in his prophecy you don't have to put it up brother john because i'm going to read it from the nlt unless you happen to have that res that version uh the new living translation haggai 2 6-9 for this is what the lord of heaven's armies says in just a little while i will again shake the heavens and the earth the oceans and the dry land i will shake all the nations and the treasure of all the nations will be brought to this temple so you can see god is moving by the time this prophecy comes on the scene this is why it's significant that brother branham picks it up in a world falling apart because now that we're nearing the millennium we're nearing home friends and so it's time to don't wait to look like a king's child there start looking like a king's child here see so i will shake all the nations and the treasures of all the nations will be brought to this temple i will fill this place with glory says the lord of heaven's armies the silver is mine and the gold is mine says the lord of heaven's armies the future glory of this temple will be greater than its past glory says the lord of heaven's armies and in this place i will bring peace i the lord of heaven's armies have spoken so you can see of course you can see we know who the armies of heaven are it's god's family it's his kingdom you don't have a kingdom without people and so god has a kingdom of saints paul told them that in hebrews 12 you haven't come to sinai that's just a mountain that shook but you've actually come to the place the spirits of just men made perfect you've come to jesus the mediator you've come to the heavenly jerusalem see yeah and so you've come to an innumerable host see and now you you see that you see that in zechariah because when zechariah and zechariah when joshua the high priest was standing there at at the trial israel was in israel had been indicted by satan and and satan is bringing an accusation against them that that they can't be your people now if he can win his case he's he's suing he's suing god and if he can win his case then he gets to take over because then god's word will fail because god has said these are my people and satan's saying based on their conduct they can't be your people it's impossible you have failed to make them your people therefore you have to give up the throne and let me have it and god now he had all the evidence he had them dead to rights he had the dna he had the instant replay he had eyewitnesses he had fingerprints he had everything that you had ever done everything that was ever guilty of that's why joshua was the high priest satan that satan didn't have to sue the whole nation see and that whole nation didn't have to appear at the courtroom before the one seated on the throne remember in daniel 9 he's seated and and we find that satan's bringing his case and he's saying they're guilty and i've got the evidence to prove it and god dismisses his charges completely out of hand based on one simple principle this is my people whom i have chosen based on elections satan all your claims all your evidence is worthless there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus no indictment is possible they can't be charged they can't be arrested you can't they have full diplomatic immunity because they're not from here they're from another kingdom and they enjoy of immunity from prosecution therefore your case is summarily dismissed get out of my courtroom and that and and and that's why that's why zachariah got so excited and put a fair miter on his head because brother m said you know that's a that's an authority and brother brandon said i don't call you church anymore i call you bride it's a whole sermon i want to get preaching on it but but i'm here to tell you that that that because of election because you came from god and you're part of god and christ is your representative you see and so he's he's your total satisfaction he both sides he was your atonement because he his life was virgin born and worthy to be a sacrifice to be the sacrificial lamb but there also had to be the perceptive side lived out because precept must be upon precept and god couldn't accept a halfway life now you can't you were never able to accomplish it i haven't been able to accomplish it so christ was not only our atonement but he lived the perceptive side on my behalf and therefore he's my total satisfaction in christ see and so so we realized then that that you see this army he says to to to joshua that if you'll keep my statutes and obey my word then i'll give you the right to stand among all these you see and then you see them again there's many places in the bible where prophets saw that great host john saw it in revelation 5. see john saw the heavenly host saw the angels saw one seat on the throne see a glass here's a strong angel representing the elijah ministry here's john representing the bride here's the 424 elder the 24 elders you know 12 in the old testament 12 in the new testament here's one of those elders saying to john don't we the lion of tribe of judah remember all that in revelation 5 notice everybody's there except one person the accuser you know why because he got dismissed in zechariah 3. see his his position to accuse the saints now he he can he still has the right to cause his trouble he's he's a puppet in the hands of god he's not literally cast out physically until revelation 12 we see him cast down because brother brown said when the bride goes up satan comes down but don't lose the sight of the fact that he's already been he's already been cast down from his ability to accuse you he can accuse you but it don't count it's already settled in heaven and when the book is claimed god just wasn't even going to have that loud mouth around the book is claimed the seals are broken and john is now eating the book and satan has no say no involvement see and then of course you see them fully assembled armies translated into glorified bodies in revelation 19 following christ out at the end of the tribulation period to take our part with christ in the final uh judgment of armageddon so so then so so so we realize then that this reference to haggai 2 6 is understood as speaking of the ultimate remaking of heavens and earth and which because even even that's going to follow the millennial kingdom and so therefore what remains after this cataclysmic event of the shaking will be eternal so when when god finishes shaking the world in the world is falling apart as brother rams said and then he said the world is again falling apart and it's going to go into a tribulation and armageddon is going to finish the matter and when god sets up a millennium and then he comes out to the millennium and breaks into a new heavens and a new earth that everything that he shook down is now going to leave only what's eternal which is his family back in the eternal earth now that's beautiful friends because that means that whatever was that that that means that whatever was original is coming back so what so so what so the power of this new covenant this new covenant he said i'm i've shook the earth but at the end time i'm going to send a prophet and he's going to identify this prophecy that i'm not only shaking earth but i'm shaking heaven i'm shaking everything and whatever whatever can be shaken from my people i'm gonna shake it from them and the power of this new covenant is to restore you and restore me back to original back to eternal thank god for that that means that nothing that this sin birth hang hang on hung on me will survive think of that friends nothing the sin birth hung on you will survive nothing that that circumstances in life put on you complexes weaknesses even things you did to your own self i'm here to tell you this message is shaking it all off of me it's returning us back to a virgin condition as though we never did it in the first place nothing that happened to me in my life that created a weakness for satan to exploit none of the things i've even done to myself that causes me harm today get to survive thank you lord so brother branham comes to the pulpit there in those closing months of 1963 and he preaches the world is falling apart see and now here's an interesting thing believers look at the chaos of the world and they easily accept that the time of shaking in heav of heaven and earth is here you can look at the chaos and say yeah i get that but but all but believers are too often afraid to realize that there's another half to the promise that not everything is destroyed what can't be shaken will remain so why is that important because there's too many times that we let the devil get us over a barrel and let him and get in our mind get to thinking there's no hope for me i can't beat it i can't get but i can't survive it this is going to take me out this is too much of a weakness if he only knew my problem if you only knew what happened to me forget it i'm here to tell you that when this prophecy of haggai comes to pass nothing that the enemy has ever put on you is going to survive this god is going to have a kingdom of free people there is a kingdom people who will stand up and rise up in this hour recognize their day and its message a kingdom people who will leave here as overcomers how many want to be an overcomer see and so it has so i all i need to do then is surrender to live under the power of this new covenant it has power to allow me to let those things go and live free do you believe that friends i'm here to tell you the power of the holy ghost i don't care how many times it's got you how weak you feel against it battles of your mind battles of your flesh battles battles in your spirit i don't care what it is i'm i'm trying to put you on notice that the remedies arrived the remedy is here this is the time when hagia's prophecy that paul carried on it's now and god is bringing this anointing upon us sure of course it's always a battle but i can win it now because why because i got a new covenant i don't have to be victim to it god has a kingdom power released to the church to get zion into a kingdom position that cannot be moved and so he's shaking everything loose from our lives to prepare us for the millennium that is a kingdom that will never end so this is literally restoring the genesis image of you when you stood perfect in the view of god and that's brother branham called it the first place i never sinned in the first place in the first place i was in christ and i was flawless that's what this anointing that's what this message this new covenant that paul recognized in his day that's now been restored in our day that's what it brings to you it doesn't bring you the ability to join a church it doesn't bring you an ability just to sing in a choir or just to say the bible taught this or the prophet taught this it's so much more than that friends it gives you the ability to become kingdom family in the first place see all of our accumulated you know life of failures and i've accumulated too many myself i'm here to tell you the lord is shaking off their effect in me amen satan is losing his grip because i've recognized what this message came to do see now paul says i'll just read a portion of this 14th verse of the fourth chapter to ephesians here's a part of why the gospel has come to us here's why this kingdom covenant is among us that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about and it's it's a sad reality when a believer has to be carried see when a a wife has to carry the husband because he's so weak mentally emotionally see spiritually and she's got to carry the load or vice versa see it's it's a shame when a pastor has to carry the people because they're they're like children and if he doesn't carry them they just get tossed around see and so so the gospel has come that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro that you know trials don't knock you off pace satan can't doesn't satan satan loses the ability uh you know he can anything can terrify a child because they don't understand the world you know the grown-up can just look out the window and make up a whole story oh it's a monster and the child will go screaming because the child doesn't have the common sense to look out the window and see mom's kidding amen so a child you you can do things that a child your what you're doing is good for them you're uh honey you know give me that knife no don't give it here but i want it but no no i know better you don't need to be carrying that through the house see that child doesn't understand to him it's a trial why is mom being so cruel to me but mom is an adult she's not a child she's mature she knows he needs to have that taken from him so so this gospel has come into this hour to not to not have us be children that we can be mature god christ isn't coming back to marry a little girl the this word born bride was an infant in one time but now she's mature he's coming back to mary the full word the image of himself grown matured ready can handle anything see david says in psalms 42 if you want to put it up brother john you can psalms 42 1-7 as the heart as the deer we would say as the heart panteth after the water brooks so penteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god psalms 42 3 my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say to me where is thy god see david had known great wonderful victories in god but this was a time when he had known terrible defeat and now david's life had went in a direction opposite of god's intention god has a pace and a direction and a destination for your life and when you go off of that path or you might even stay kind of on the path but you're going too slow you're not maturing quickly enough because maybe you don't come to church enough maybe you don't read your bible enough maybe you don't pray enough maybe you don't do any all of the above enough and you're a believer and you're moving along but you're not making progress i'm going to here to tell you something friends god has ways of bringing things upon you to speed you up to bring you back onto the path that he has for you david got off that path verse 4 when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with him to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day see he tried to he tried to just you know psyche his self out i'll just go to church and sing some songs clap my hand and tap my foot and get my blood moving and i'm going to get victory over this you're not going to get victory over it till you repent until you come back to god humbly and ask god to restore you see and why he comes right to the next verse to show that that didn't work verse 5 why art thou cast down o my soul why art thou disquieted in me hope thou and god come on for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermenites from the hill of mazar deep calleth unto the deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves now catch this all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me so david is describing he's trying to fight against it he's trying to encourage himself he's trying to go to church but he's he you know it what he did is gonna take some some some fruit some meat of repentance he's he's committed a horrible failure and now he's got to work his way back to god and he's got to show his dedication and you know what when you get in that condition you say well i go to church and i don't i don't really feel better just keep coming so when i pray but my prayers don't get higher than the ceiling just keep praying god is looking to see how serious you are he's not here you know to just pat you on the head and say oh i'm sure you'll do better next time okay go ahead no this is a heavenly father who's trying to train you stay on the train the train is taking you somewhere see jonah comes in jonah chapter 2 verse 1 and 3 then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice for thou hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compass me about and here's this curious word again all thy billows and thy waves passed over me that's the word right where david was that's what exactly what david said thy billows are going over me all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me here's job saying all thy billows and thy waves passed over me now i don't i don't i'm going to show you a demonstration tonight and it's called the calvin helmholtz instability experiment all right it's brief i'm going to show you two clips of it one is less than a minute one's about a minute and a half and i'm going to show you this because it'll give you a really good visual image of what's of what can be happening sometimes in our lives now let me explain some of the science to you before i do all right now we're going to be dealing specifically with shear that gets created over the surface of water and there's a number of things that can that can cause shear now that's a broad term uh captain john has to deal with sheer and wind currents and you know he can be he can be coming in at a you know coming in for a landing up in this and he's got a headwind and that headwind now he's got his speed and his angle of his flaps and it's all good and he's he's got his approach and then he has to be careful because when he drops down then he'll drop down and then he loses that headwind it's a different atmosphere it's running the the wind is not coming head-on at him and now suddenly the plane is falling and he's got to spool up the engines adjust the flaps you ever been coming in on a final approach and you're getting lower and you're getting lower and all of a sudden you hear the engines go cranking that's the pilot because he's he's working on those wind currents and he's got to be careful of a microburst because which i guess doppler radars handled a lot of that for you brother john but back before they used to have that they'd have a microburst that would come down and if it and if it came on the end they approach into the runway it's very deadly because it comes straight down and hits it and then it goes like that and it'll throw an up current out here and here comes the pilot with his speed set and he hits that updraft and you know what he's trying to land he don't want to go up so you know what he does naturally he pulls back on the power i got to get this thing on the ground and then suddenly that that up current is gone he hits the microburst and it slams him into the ground and there's no way he has time to spool the engines back up many planes i landed at charlotte and just a few weeks ahead of when i was landing even the whole ground was still burning the fence was knocked down where that very exact same thing happened before they installed the doppler radar at charlotte douglas and they didn't see it it hit right at the end of the runway and he he flew into it and he powered back and it drifted down and then he hit the downdraft and there's no way to get it and the plane hit the ground probably 50 yards ahead of the runway and blew up and killed everybody see and so so that's that's sheer you know you can have winds like this and winds like this and then and in that line of demarcation between winds going this way and winds going that way it creates a sheer you have winds up here and winds down here and there's a shear line well when wind blows over water if the water's trying to go this way and the wind's trying to go that way it creates a sheer and then that you see white caps you see waves you see you see oceans and billows and storms what's happened the wind is moving over the water and it's moving faster than the water and the water gets all in a turmoil amen it's called bill as you can see bill is in cloud formations and and and there's a famous painting about builders i forget which which artist uh that that did it and um and and you'll you'll see these billows of clouds or billows of waves and here here david is saying all thy waves and thy billows and jonah's saying all thy billows and thy waves have gone over me now what causes that and i'm going to show you this this this instability experiment what they're going to do is they're going to take uh a tank a sealed tank and they're going to put fresh water in first which is heavier and is going to stay on the bottom then they're going to slowly move salt water in and the salt water is lighter so it'll go above the fresh water and and it'll be two different kinds of water salt water and fresh water and they'll actually put a dye in the fresh water so you can see the lower water in the upper water all right it's both water but one salt one's fresh and they do it slow so that they don't disturb it because they want that perfect that perfect line between the two amen now what what they do then is they tilt the tank now because the fresh water is heavy it wants to run downhill but because the salt water is light it wants to get back floating on the top it goes uphill and that like that when it does that it creates sheer and you're going to see what happens in your life when god's got this direction for you but you want to go this way amen let's see it brothers there's no sound and i've got it that way on purpose this one doesn't even have it anyway this is the experiment now you're going to see it salt water above fresh water on the bottom with dye color he tilts it everything looks fine right it doesn't happen immediately see the fresh water trying to go downhill now watch what happens to your life watch wait for it boom billows it's a phenomenon of the physical world all right let's watch it again let's watch it again they're going to do it in slow mo everything's fine oh my life is going along wow something's going on lord what are you doing oh let me just pray harder lord i'm sure it'll get better lord you'll take care of me right oh lord i believe your word what's going on in my life lord what's happening what are you doing to me why is my life in turmoil and this is what happens in people's lives all right let's go let's here here here they're going to show it again on a graph and that's what happens billows that's what you see on water you see a seed tossed in turbulence see it's because of sheer over the water has caused that all right go ahead and take that down and pull up the next one same thing again a little bit of a longer a little bit longer of one just to give you a really good visual because i think that's important i think you'll be able to see you're going to be able to explain to yourself and if you can't get it i'm going to help you i'm going to show you why sometimes the things in our lives and we wonder why is god doing this to me it might not be god all right let's keep watching here's our scientist lady she's got fresh water on the bottom with blue dye she's got salt water now she tilts it same thing she's showing this instability experiment they're zooming in boom there's your life topsy-turvy turmoil flipping you don't understand what's going on uh and and watch they'll keep doing it again i think they'll go there's a slo-mo there's a slo-mo that's your life when you're when god tries to go this way for you because you're a kingdom child yes amen god's god's trying to make you a kingdom child but you're determined to go like this see watch turmoil that's that's what happens here we go again here's a nice slo-mo right oh what's going on lord you'll help me surely you help me lord i know you'll do it i know you're my joy and my whole life lord what are you doing to me i thought i was a christian i i thought i could depend on you i thought you were you're a very present help in time for trouble what are you doing well i was surely it'll get better tomorrow to be better tomorrow oh sunday it'll be better i'll get further there and i'll have right there and pray for me why is it getting worse god you don't love me oh it can't get any worse now i'm sure that's as bad as it can get until it does it can't get any worse until it does i think we've seen enough brothers it makes you uncomfortable to look at that doesn't it it's not always the devil causing billows in your life it's not always the devil causing billows in your life if god has a vision for your life that's the upper stream if your lower life is going in the opposite direction you get me you're creating the shear you're causing the turmoil if you're languishing if you're failing to make progress and the wind of god's determination say well i am a christian i'm going in god's way but you're moving along and the wind is trying to get you to move faster and you don't you create sheer you bring billows and turmoil in your life you're because you're living out of time your life isn't in time and harmony and rhythm and that's what brother branham brings to us in shalom that it's all a great drama that it's a symphony that it's a great musical drama he says where you know music's so amazing brother branham said you can close your eyes and live in it and that's god looking at your life god wants to look at your life and live in your life god wants to make you a kingdom child this is the hour of shaking not only the earth but shaking heaven and earth your your billows then are brought on by you and i want to say this it may not be god punishing you it's likely god actually acting in faithfulness toward you those billows can be god's faithfulness acting towards you in love you see this is why put put verse three of jonah back up for me brother john jonah uh where we in uh we were in uh in jonah chapter two and let's look at verse three again oh my for thou he says here let me let me let me catch the one above it and and said i cried by reason of my affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heard us my voice watch this third verse for thou hast cast me into the deep see in the midst of the seas and the floods compass me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me for thou hast cast me into the deep jonah realized god had thrown him overboard not his shipmates it wasn't the ship's crew that threw jonah over they physically acted out but jonah realized that it was god it was not his shipmates sometimes friends it's not your you say oh they said this against me they did this i know that pastor is preaching on me i know the church i know that people are looking thinking laughing i know my wife i know my husband i know what's happening this is somebody's fault it might not be the pastor that threw you overboard might not be your spouse that threw you overboard might be god it might be god that threw you overboard see might not be your shipmates at all it was god to jonah it was god acting in faithfulness toward his son that's where i want to be yielded today that's where you need to be yielded today i've proven to you by bible prophecy by a prophet in this day showing you this is the hour of hebrews 12. this is the hour of haggai chapter 2. this is what's he doing bringing on a kingdom what are we looking for we're not looking for a superman brother abraham said don't chase super stop doing that don't chase supers don't worry about a superman or a super doctrine or super revelation or super revival we're not after presidents or great geniuses that's not what we're chasing see that's not even why we're here we're not to be enamored by those kinds of things whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven the the because why it's the removing of those things that are shaken so it's removing the loose things in our lives so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain what will remain everything that's the word of god in my life will remain i don't care what happens to you in life that word of god will keep you it will strengthen you it will it will be your harbor it will be your shalom it will be your safety it'll be a covert from storm that those things which cannot be shaken may remain listen friends when the heavenly father sees you are still easily unsettled in your mind unsettled in your maturity unsettled in your spiritual growth just know that he'll keep shaking he will keep shaking because the power of god behind the coming kingdom is here today it's here right now it's moving in real time it's all in preparation to do what make us unmovable in that kingdom make you unmovable i said to my church when i finished this certain part of it right here i said friends my whole life has one goal to become unmovable to become mature in christ like paul said paul goes down a list of this is going to happen and prophecy tells me that chains await me and my countrymen are going to betray me and all these things are happening but paul said but none of these things move me how would you like to say lord no matter what the devil throws no matter what the world shakes no matter what happens in the election no matter what happens in finances no matter what happens with with pandemics nor call it a pandemic or a plan gimmick or like brother branham called it a pandemonic doesn't matter which one ever you want to call it i will not be moved i have my feet on the rock and i'm not moved i'm not shaken because i allowed the lord to shake everything off my life oh friends that's where we ought to be tonight say lord no i don't want billows in my life i'm sorry you were having me this way i was trying to go this way no today i'm turning around i'm going in the direction you want me to go i want kingdom power in my home i want kingdom power among my children i want kingdom power in this church how many want kingdom power in this church to say that the the the devils can be cast out by the preaching of the word oh let's stand to our feet kingdom children kingdom saints this is what god has done for us in this hour paul says but none of those things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god i want to be unmovable as they play uh something of their own choosing brother whatever you would like let's bow our heads friends i just want to offer prayer for you [Music] father we thank you for your word this evening and lord and we had had a glorious time in your word this morning's service lord and so that we could see where we are in time we could see that our lives are driven by a purpose of god we can see that nothing is accidental we can see that you have a direction for us you can we can see now tonight we can look back over our lives and we wonder why did this happen why did that storm why this billow i felt like jonah i felt like david there's times preacher when the waves just seemed to be going over my head i was just being swept and tossed in in turmoil and billows and i kept praying and it got worse and i prayed some more and then it got worse again and i tried to have everybody praying and it kept getting worse and it kept getting worse and i i thought god had forsaken me i thought i i must have lost out i thought i must have not been elected had nothing to do with that friends it was god in loving kindness changing the direction of your life it was god bringing you lord you brought us into compliance you brought our lives into the into the direction that you wanted you had a vision for us lord you had a vision before there was stardust you had a vision of me you see me on the other side perfected in christ you see me standing in victory smiling breathing free air with my hands in the air praising god you see me standing there lord around your throne sometimes i have a hard time seeing it but you see it clear and therefore lord you're acting upon my life and faithfulness to bring me to that image i say lord today today i want to i want to say to you lord on on behalf of me and behalf of all these people bring us today a little closer to the image you saw of us before the foundation of the world and whatever it takes lord i i'm sorry that you had to throw me overboard so many times i'm sorry waves and billows and and i cried out to you and and and the waves and the billows just like david i i kept crying and i wet my pillow and cried all night and how long you gonna hold out lord and i'm gonna try to go to church and i'm gonna try to praise my way out of it lord what's going on help me help me the lord finally did lord you finally did help him but you you you loved david too much to leave him like he was you love us too much lord you found us in a condition you you it wasn't meeting us at an altar and saying okay you're saved see you in heaven no lord you you put us on a path of a path of development a path of growth a path of maturity and it's only when we it's only when we try to take a different direction or or our lives slow down maybe because we we we started prioritizing other things ahead of our spirituality we we went after a career we went after an education we went after money went after friends went after this went after that and it we stayed a christian we stayed a believer but somehow it slowed us down lord and we lost the time and the rhythm of the music he bound us up and pitched us overboard many times lord we've sank down and it felt like we were in the belly of of hell as jonah said no end in sight but i'm here to say lord i thank you for those billows i raise up my hands and i say father i thank you you pitched me over billows and waves i know i'm the one created that sheer it wasn't you after all wasn't even the devil i can't even blame him i have to say it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer father i believe that this word is here to touch the hearts of your people tonight your word is eternal whether i'm preaching this material in just south carolinians or whether i'm preaching it to arizonans it doesn't matter lord it's your family and it's your eternal word and it comes home and it hits home to us tonight i know father that hearts now this has hit home i know it's been an era of deliverance the lord has answered a lot of questions it's given new perspective it's challenged people and i thank you for that lord god and i pray tonight master if there's anyone here lord and they're just in billows and waves are rolling over them and they're they've come to church and they just can't make sense of it all oh god let this word be the answer they've needed let lord all it takes father all it takes is to realign your life with god's direction and god's timing set your life to the to the march of the gospel like that sainted bunch of little girls that's what happened to those two or three at the end they were still in an order of ascending they were still part of the bride but they got out of step lord i'm glad a prophet said the last thing i saw when i was coming out of the vision they were hurrying to get back in step oh lamb of god comfort hearts tonight say child just hurry get back in step it's not that hard just get back in step you'll you'll come up out of those billows you'll come up out of those waves your life will start to make sense lord help us tonight i pray you'll grant it to us in jesus name [Music] do you love him friends [Music] you know i um i had an idea and brother aaron gave me permission to do it and i hope it's okay with you sister elizabeth you got to come sing that for me again i was so moved by both specials because the words i thought about the lyrics these young sisters were over here singing about right before i come up and i thought about what sister elizabeth was singing about i said lord my goodness your plans are still to prosper you have not forgotten us you're with us in the fire and in the flood you're faithful forever perfect in love you are sovereign over us come sis come to the microphone and sing that force he's faithful friends i don't care whether it's fire i don't care whether it's flood i don't care whatever it feels like how many will accept god's word tonight you accept that he's here to restore he's here to bring you back into a kingdom order that's all that's missing if you feel like what's missing in my life that's it it's not complicated i've shown you i took today we took pains to go through the bible and show you god's purpose in in election to show you his his plan and how all the history all the history of all the books has all been under the control of god to come to this hour everything that's happened in your life has been to bring you now to here right now you believe it amen now let's let's stay on our feet as she sings i want you to think about these words not just a pretty song you remember that's what happened to israel with jeremiah and they wouldn't they wouldn't follow what jeremiah was trying to preach to him and god explained it said well it it's because they just think of your sermons as a lovely song you're a great eloquent preacher jeremiah and they just they love to hear you oh what a preacher said but to them it's just a lovely song don't let this be just a lovely song this is ministry this is god's word set to melody sung by a child of his kingdom how many want to receive what god has for let's enter into some worship here before we go the preaching's over we're done we're getting to go home a little bit how about we worship him just a little bit amen sing it for us sister amen listen to these words now
