TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the title I've given this series is the kingdom but I've used this phrase that I hope kind of stays right in your minds as we go along in this is that heaven's mystery and Earth Glory because there's just those phrases and maybe I'll just pull back the curtain a little bit I toyed with it for a few months is it is it Heaven's glory and Earth's mystery or is it Heaven's mystery and Earth's Glory or is it Heaven's mystery Earth's mystery Earth's Glory Heavens glory and you find out that it's all the same you just had to pick one or the commas would get out of control but Heaven's mystery Earth Glory I think's a mouthful and really means a lot as we go into this I hope it just becomes something for us to begin to think about glorious things that relate to us in our bridegroom Christ from the certain sermon countdown this is um real important thought um to keep reinforcing because this is a real driving factor in this sermon and this is a quote that really stuck in my heart years and years ago even before I began to minister uh and I can still remember the first time I even heard it and it just really stuck with me as this principle um that God is part of God's nature and his character and it was one of those quotes where you know he said it but you just if you have a different way of trying to look it up you won't be able to find it and now I've hopefully imprinted it in my mind so that I won't get lost say what's that one about him moving towards the kingdom but you kind of have to have it going toward the kingdom is this phrase and he says as science achieves something Looking Backward and that's what science does is it regresses God achieves going this away going forward to the kingdom and I would say that as he says God is always going forward to the kingdom that that represents something that is God's ultimate what he's trying to achieve and not that God would always fall short of the goal because we it's not that God's dangling a carrot out in front of himself just to keep him motivated but it's a Target that he has that he knows he's going to achieve and he's going to accomplish it just as God had a heart purpose and something he wanted to achieve and that's what this Kingdom represents and reflects as maybe Sunday or sometime in the near future if God will allow start looking at different aspects of the Kingdom that there must be one who is the most preeminent there must be a domain that he has rulership and authority over and in God's kingdom it's not just a man but it's a man and a woman ruling and reigning together so that's what God wanted to achieve and I would say the kingdom has God's purpose from the beginning God's purpose from the beginning we could use as a phrase just to kind of bring into view a lot of different things is a kingdom or was a kingdom and as we look at part two of the seeds of the Kingdom if I could put it this way in the beginning God planted the seeds of the Kingdom that's kind of how we looked at it on Sunday he planted the seeds of Heaven's mystery and Earth's glory god the invisible God you could just start when he was invisible formed himself in the logos this God who begins to create he creates first by the spoken word in those that spoken word becomes seeds in itself uh that he plants in the beginning he plants the seeds of Heaven's mystery and Earth's glory and if I could say this in the beginning he plants the seeds of his threefold purpose because God brother Brown has a way of uses that incredible sermon which I believe that seventh seal uh that silence lifting from that seventh seal and revealing Christ and he says that God the threefold purpose of Christ and and it just takes in a threefold manner sums up everything that was in the back part of God's mind that was deep in God's heart and so when you think about that it's just so easy to use it as maybe a framework to preach A good sermon and you got your threes and you got your numerology but we got to be careful that in the Simplicity of him breaking it down into three we don't just chop it up into something that's academic one plus one equals two it's just a vast truth that supernatural has brought in the Simplicity of his threefold purpose now in Genesis chapter 1 verse one I'm just jumping into this uh not feet first I'm just diving head in in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and then in verse 25 of chapter 2 and they the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed as we looked at that we looked at that as bookends or frame of God's original creation the world that God loved the Eden God's pleasure God's Delight his God's pleasure Garden as the different phrases could be used about it used of so in chapter one well there's a lot more than just in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth but we're going to use that to refer to all the days in which God created and then even when God took his rest we find in verse 25 that the man and the woman they are naked and unashamed it's the man and his wife this is a creation set forth we used even that image of that man and the woman being naked that it even sets them it puts them forth as unadorned as seeds with not ashamed because as a seed you say oh well you're just a seed you're just a bear seed you don't have anything to brag about but in it is the potential to transform itself into a fruit-bearing dream into a full branch a full Vine of different ways you could look at him so he looked at even that image of the man and the woman as seed form of what God's wanting to accomplish and it was brother Kevin Britton was sharing with me how their youngest daughter was making a comment Sister Crystal I gave you a little bit more of the story to Sister Elizabeth and how they were talking about the service and they said well what did Brother Aaron preach about and he said he preached about Adam and Eve and they were both naked and I thought well it's bless God somebody got something out of it and I said and I and I was hoping that she at least knew they weren't ashamed and took that in the right way uh but we know that they're they are listening and I'm probably giving you guys a lot more work than you want uh with some of these things but that's wonderful gives us devotion material but if you if you looked at Genesis chapter one it'd be very easy for you to read these things in your in your devotion time and just slowly read through and looked at how God's creating reminding yourself that a detail in the Bible is important that it's it's not like uh some of these college students do that if they have to write a 700 word essay there's a lot of Vats and ands and you know superlatives just to get to the word limit and God's not just trying to fill up a word limit if he puts it in there there's something weighing in his mind there's something heavy in his heart there's something he wants to bring across to you and one thing that's just something struck me by inspiration and I used a phrase when I was preaching here recently and and I went back I followed back in the scripture and it just became even more real to me how that God in many places you read in the scripture is describing somebody but then when you read it and say wait a minute God's portraying himself in this character and oh it just gets I get goosebumps right now just think about it God is wanting us to see himself in this Prophet God's wanting to see himself and Adam Gods want us to see himself and how God himself was overflowing with inspiration and bubbling up about something and wanting to pour forth declaration so chapter one and chapter two give us so much detail a lot of it I would say symbolic and representing different things but these first two chapters of the Bible all the seeds of God's kingdom are planted all the seeds are sown and if uh if and I'm drawing this from study the message meticulously in the way that brother Branham lays this out that that is I think it's something that we just accept and we don't need to stumble at it that when God spoke the word he speaks at the spoken word is the Original Seed and that that in that and and represented himself the word has come into some manifestation in word form and in it is everything that God wants to be you say well if you put it that way that was that may be easier to digest But as God says in the beginning God created that brings God in the beginning this creation comes forth and these are the seeds chapters of everything God's going to accomplish and it's it's been planted and it is spoken word is this seed that's been sown now as you if you're just taking these cues in ways that you could just be reading your Bible if you're to take to the end of the Bible in Revelations chapter 21 and begin to read chapter 21 and chapter 22 we'll find that the last two chapters of the Bible I'm presenting to you that the seeds that God sowed in the beginning the seeds of God's kingdom are now eternally mature that now they have secured their permanent position they have manifested in their perfection and their Glory what is represented kind of in this preview of Glory in the Eden in the beginning we now get to the end and I think it's appropriate to think of that as being the Eden in the end that now God's kingdom is established forever in an eighth day eternally as you begin to read in these last two chapters of the Bible the seeds that were spoken into existence in the first two chapters are now permanently secure and mature in the end it says in Revelations 21 it describes uh new heavens and new earth it describes the bride of Christ the New Jerusalem right these are things that are being described and notice in these three verses here in chapter 22 and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life so now the image that we could start creating between in the beginning and now in the never-ending beginning uh there's a a representation of the tree of life there's a glory there's an Eden and it says that there on the other side of the river was there the Tree of Life which beared 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month I I find myself just uh hating have to just skim over these things but and the leaves of the tree for the healing of the Nations wow what Rich things and remember this for later and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and the lamb shall be in it and his servant Shall Serve him and it continues on but I want you to just catch this picture at the end that now we have the Tree of Life that is going to be for the healing of Nations and now this is God has already represented this symbolically in symbol form and Seed form in the beginning so I'm just want to think in the beginning these first two chapters and now in the end what we see represented here these are the seeds of the kingdom in the beginning this is the kingdom in the end Genesis 1 1 God created the heavens and the Earth Revelations 21 1 John sees a new Heaven and a new Earth see the Symmetry see how these things the picture in the end in Genesis 1 16 the Bible says that the sun will rule the day and the moon rules the night Revelations 21 24 it says the city had no need for the sun or moon now that's so think of that how there's something that God Expresses in the beginning but now in the end it's not the god if I could say this is what God was progressing to this is where God wanted to end up and and I will acknowledge since I know you all remember every single sermon I've preached in every quote and every scripture and somebody's you know they have ledgers how many times they say Ponder and so I know they're keeping a ledger of when I preach these things and what I say and and they're pondering all these pontifications and things that are being mentioned but in that uh in this these some of these things were mentioned I know that I went over this in great detail already in uh previously in a series on in the beginning was the title of it and so if you want to go back and listen to this I know I've preached these some of these things before and I it doesn't bother me it doesn't bother me at all that I've preached it before uh and you can go back and hear it in Greater detail if you want to subscribe to our Channel and so it says that the Sun and the Moon rule won the day one the night but then in Revelations 21 there's going to be no need for the sun or moon and what I'm wanting to identify is this symmetry how that specifically Revelations 21 is now calling back to the beginning Genesis 1 5 God creates darkness and night God's doing this in the beginning but now in Revelation 21 25 it says there shall be no night there now notice how God if we know that the last chapter wasn't written when he created but if you can think about how that God now is forecasting things and God is producing contrast that in the end he wants to do away with the contrast because he's wanting to achieve something and so as you as you look at that I'm wanting you just to see how there's things in the beginning and there's things in the end and I'm not wanting to look at it as opposites but I'm wanting to look at how this is what it was in the seed form this is what it is and it's per and it's a manifestation full manifestation now if you'll look at our text again I want to start with verse 36 and Matthew 13. it says in Matthew 13 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and and they're in the house they say declaring us the parable the tears of the field we could have read this earlier in verses 24 to 30. and now he's just very direct he that soweth the good seed is the son of man and in verse 24 the son of man then sows the seed in his field it's important to note that we know that Satan didn't create the Earth this isn't his ground so the seed is sown and it's good seed and it's in his field and the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the chairs are the children of the wicked one there we could just Branch off of that into the original sin and recognize that what we call the doctrine of original sin is uh we is one thing the consequence of that is what we call serpent seed and it's best to look at that as a hybrid between the the man and the woman as God originally intended to be and the the serpent which was a an upright uh being creature that could speak and would have had some Affinity to humanity in terms of the way they look and even allow those Bloodlines to mix and and that's the resulting mongrelizes brother bam uses the word but the hybrid the weakening of the Nations or the weakening of the people through the original sin I think sometimes we get this doctrine of uh serpent seed to where we just look out and uh and we look out in a restaurant and we just say Vipers every one of them just vipers and and and really we're hissing when we say that right you don't realize it but you're going snipers everything a lot of them right because you've got hybrid flesh and the election is what God sowed and and that's according to election Divine favor and Grace in this body is hybrid it's come fallen and nature comes fallen so there's a lot that we could really dig into and if the Lord would lead I'm more than happy too uh go into those details of the original sin and the resulting of serpent seed as a result of that right let's take this principle that if the son of man sowed good seed we say God sold perfect seed John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word brought forth Heaven and Earth I'm drawing a lot from Sunday morning to make those statements so God's word brings forth the Heaven and the Earth God sows good seed now I want to look at a few scriptures so that we can recognize and I guess I'm just gonna have to say it I'm not trying to hide this but go listen to Future home and I'm wanting to recognize the permanence and the Eternal quality of those things which are spoken word attributes of God and so in Psalm 8 verse 3 it says when I considered thy Heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou Hast ordained so when we think of even the moon the stars and the heavens as the firmament and the skies is different from the earth it is things that are the works of his hands and which he has ordained it's by the word of God that the heavens were framed that the earth was formed so we understand by faith and believe as Christians that God created the Heaven and the Earth by his word that these are things that step forth fresh from God's mind and he put them forward uh with a and I don't want to just say created them but he had a purpose and he ordained them and predetermined something about them and then in Job chapter 38 and I had a few more verses around this because I just love uh the bands of Orion and the the different ways that the God is challenging job and look at this Heavens did you lay these out there do you determine do you determine these things did you set these forth and this language knoweth thou the ordinances of Heaven do you know the statute and enactment of the stars in the heavens can't thou set the Dominion thereof in the Earth there is a rule and a Dominion of the heavens and the Earth is what he's saying can you do that well no man can't man only studies it but God did that he they're the ordinance the statutes of the heaven something bound up in it it was the heavens were God's first Bible so he was deliberate in how he laid these things out and you can see that and even his man studied it and they they see the serpents meet in that and they see Orion and they see the different constellations and they see even uh the representation and different things and God is declaring something in his Bible or his first Bible in the heavens these are the ordinances or the enactments of the stars and of the heavens that God ordained and there is a Dominion of them in the earth some Rule and authority and this connection to Earth so it's God by his ordination and predetermination laid out the stars in the firmament in the heavens and then in speaking of the heavens in Psalms 148 verse 6 it says he hath also established them forever and ever them this is the heavens he hath made a decree which shall not pass now that's uh I'll say this at this point it's written in the gospels in three different places I believe it's verbatim every single time Heaven nurse shall pass away but my words shall never pass away shall not pass away and now this is and I think I say it just to introduce a paradox because now he has established the heavens which shall not pass and has made a decree which shall not pass so something just to think about what it means heaven or shall not pass or pass away what is meant by that phrase and that saying but the word will never pass away and these are this is an important principle of the Kingdom this is an important principle as we want to look deeper into some of the things that brother Branham says in the future home that to me are just very very striking and settling and help us understand a lot of things that have eternal quality and other things that do not that yet can be sustained eternally but aren't spoken word attributes of God and so God has established the heavens by his fingers by his ordination there's the ordinances of Heaven the Dominion thereof in the earth establish them forever and ever he's made a decree which shall not pass these are important principles of the kingdom in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and his spoken word is the Original Seed Bill Abram says now this word of God is eternal God being infinite cannot speak one thing and then later on change it to something else to a better decision Ah that's nice because every decision of god is perfect he cannot now this is the the punch here once his word is once spoken it can never die it lives on on and can never die because it is God so once it is spoken it cannot die it lives on because it is God his word can no more die than he can die now that's that's a lot I think that there's some f to that there's some weight there's some turning over that we can do in our hearts to try to understand that every decision of god is perfect once his word is spoken it lives on on and can never die as we could draw from the principles we used on Sunday morning on how that once the word is there it will manifest whatever life is in it whatever it'll be It's gotta manifest it's got to come forward so if I want to just step forward in this but can we uh just by by just by ESP or telepathy just kind of inform me right now that we're all on the same page good because I want to go forward in this and I want to use a statement that hopefully we could just cover a lot of ground in reading this remember I said he's the Creator and the sermon Abraham and remember this once God speaks his word it can never die once it speaks his word it can never die he's the Creator he could do anything he wants to he just picked up some petroleum and Cosmic light and calcium and potash and blow it into it and stepped into the body and come down that's the exact exactly the way he did it he had Angels there the same way he can do the same thing where did he come from who made the Earth where did he get the stuff to make the Earth out of tell me where he went out and got it at the very Earth that we're setting on is the word of God made manifest I know there's layers to this but the very Earth that we're sitting on is the word of God made manifest the pulpit is the word of God this is the word of God made manifest he's saying that man that this is the this wood this genuine Hardwood comes back to some element that God had created but this base principle the Earth we're setting on as the word of God made manifest the pulpit the word of God this is the word of God made manifest God spoke it and he's the Creator and he made it out of things that we're not here that we're not here to make it with in other words he speaks originally the one who speaks and by and nothing exists and by that he forms things he created he says God of purpose he can create he can do whatever he wants to he's God now that to me becomes kind of the uh the final say he said oh well you can't do that well no God can can do whatever he wants no but you know no God's God he can do whatever he wants but he has a purpose in doing it and so when he does something he's not just doing it for kicks he's very deliberate very intentional about it and he says the Earth is a the word of God made manifest and then when he says about the pulpit and I believe he's saying that this Pulpit it's the word of God made manifest because it's drawn from elements that God spoke into existence in the beginning and I know there's a lot of chain that we can think of there uh that maybe interrupts and hybrid and manipulated and fabricated into different things in it but he said he's God and as he says he creates a body out of all these elements in the earth he can step into it he's preaching about Abraham the Earth is a spoken word attribute of God God can do this is the word of God made manifest he has a purpose God can do whatever he wants uh the thing that just kept striking my heart is if this is so of the earth then what about the those attributes that God created the Earth for the purpose of expressing what about his what about his elect what about those that he desires to have fellowship with and you're going to listen to uh things that ought to be in December 5th of 1965 and he's saying you are the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God and that it's your duty to express God to your neighbors and in your your those you associate with and that's no light sentence that's that's no light meat that That's Heavy that that's the word of God in this last days because you are the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God in the beginning that means even before God ever formed himself into logos he had certain attributes and then we realized that you are now expressing that and you are a bear of that and you are representing that so that's what you are you are a manifestation of God just in the Summers of this Earth this Earth is intended to be a spoken word attribute of God a manifestation of God then what about this Earth what about what God wants me to express and declare so as in the beginning the son of man soweth good seed in the world the good seat are the children of the Kingdom but then the wicked one comes secondarily and he sows Terrors which are called Children of the wicked one now in verse 39 it says the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels now I'll say that there's certainly no shortage of material to preach when it comes to the message of the hour and so the real challenge becomes how can you take something that's Eternal and put it in a snippet on a Wednesday night and that's the real that's why you're praying for me I trust is to be able to I think if somebody said they're trying to drink out of a fire hydrant or something but that's what we're trying to do is to get you in front of that fire hydrant long enough to get something out of it and so if it doesn't if you're left wanting more and if I fail to just get it across in a way that it deserves to be brought across keep praying for me I'm applying myself more and more and trying to humble myself more and more to do the best that I can for you but and I realize there's there's a lacking there when you look at the full picture how can you describe this how can you really describe this so I'm just pulling elements and trying just to express this and this is the next element I want you to look at this enemy that sowed them as the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels God made the Earth for a purpose brother Graham said and Satan defiled it defiled the purpose even defiled the Earth so we could go back to Genesis chapter three so Genesis chapter 1 and chapter two God sows his seed The Original Seed the son of man sowed good seed every word has been sown every word has been spoken once God speaks his word it lives on and on and on and on and can't die all right so we got that part down now the next thing that sowed is by the wicked one the enemy which is the devil he sows Bad Seed so in Genesis Chapter 3 The Wicked one sow seeds that bring forth the tares and these tares then he achieves it because he doesn't have his own seed he achieves it by hybriding and by mixing seed and God had brought forth seed and that seed was to stay in a particular way and express itself in a particular way and as long as it stayed in its Lane it fulfilled God's purpose and it would manifest what God intended it to but as soon as you took things God was very particular in the beginning this has to be each after its kind this one don't do this don't do that what was he doing don't mix don't uh intermingle and so what Satan did is he sowed seed by mixing and so it was a perversion of the original seed and a diversion from God's original program so what Satan has not done is Satan has not created of his own he has not he God didn't say God created and then saying goes okay all right I see what you did there let's see what we can do and then he creates that's not what happens and so brother Brenner makes the statement in power of transformation science is taking the natural things and perverting it to do the things that it wasn't intended to do that's a statement that stands that can be applied in so many different ways taking natural things and perverting it to do things that it wasn't intended to do so Satan's kingdom was set up because we know science and these things are part of Satan civilization science takes natural things and perverts it in ways that it wasn't intended to do Satan's kingdom was set up by perverting God's original spoken word that's what science is doing is taking natural things and perverted it they're not invent creating new substance they're perverting existing substance so that's Satan's kingdom that's Satan's program he doesn't vary from the way that he does things he set up his kingdom and I think it's important to recognize that Satan has a kingdom he set up his kingdom by perverting the original program The Original Seed and brother Branham says and the seed shall not be air with the shuck the kingdom of God which is in the Earth today can never be set up justly on a permissive will it's got to come back to his perfect will so in the beginning God spoke his word that's his perfect will that's his program everything clicking on everything bringing forth if it's kind it could do nothing else because God said so that's the way that God kind of sets it forward that's the momentum enter the wicked one who hybrids and perverts and it's the scientific approach that takes seeds and mixes them together to do what produce a better Kingdom a more glorious Kingdom but that it's not it's not better it's not more glorious in doing so it produces death that's what brother Branham is saying in Satan's Eden power to power of transformation these are all the principles that were just you know we just feel that fire hydrant knocking our teeth out as we try to drink from it these are all the things flowing forth in that so the kingdom of God was set up on God's perfect will and it only will be repositioned on God's perfect will the perfect will God's God's original word The Original Seed so then the kingdoms of this world as we would use that phrase are not the original they're secondary they're perverted they're not again God God didn't cast Satan out of heaven and then as Satan was tumbling he kind of just said well I need a place to land and created an earth and now that's Satan's kingdom and Heaven is God's kingdom now the Earth is Satan's kingdom and now the two have been warring ever since and when God's done and I think we touched on this a couple Wednesday nights ago when God's done is this going to destroy the Earth and banish Satan to hell and everybody who lived on Earth you better have chose Heaven over hell or you're going to end up in hell too that's not the way that it plays out in in the Catholic comics and so this is the the kingdom of this world they're secondary they are the perversion of God's original spoken word now listen to the way that brother Bram says this in the sermon you must be born again and this is uh I really feel the Liberty to use this because of the statements we used on Sunday morning then in came sin and send marred the picture there's that framing of Genesis 1 chapter 2 and and the beautiful picture of God God's Masterpiece the Masterpiece family walled behind the word of God and then sin comes in Satan snucked in and marred God's Masterpiece but sin can't stop the purpose of God God will not be defeated so then because sin came in woman brought forth man which was secondary a perverted way God never created him out of the Dust of the Earth with his own hands the woman had to bring him through sex and we know that this is how all creation has populated upon the face of the Earth since the fall then what happened are you ready for something to keep you up tonight when we make our bodies from the dust of the earth that calcium that Lumber that potash that God had laid out is still being used one day the last bit of it will be used up God laid out all of his material that's right the lumbar pile will go down God but God still makes man from the dust of the Earth and you come on this Earth without having any reason anyway no way at all you had of bringing yourself here God brought you here you say well how how could that be the only way that the only one who could architect this is God who can lay all the material out in such a way and know that this one's going to do this and this is going to happen that's going to happen this is going to happen that's only God could do that oh only God has that power and that capacity to do that and and it's and it's represented I think in a very simple way not that we could just completely figure out like whoa I tapped into the Matrix Matrix and I see it all but just to accept that God laid all his material out there and and all of that's got to be used because he had an intention he was very deliberate about this it's all being laid out there and he says one day the lumber pile will go down in other words there's got to be a time when the last one is expressed and the Earth is filled up because the seeds that God had envisioned that would come forth from this Earth have been made manifest and he says one day the lumber power will go down he's saying God brought you here God brought you here when we make up our these bodies are still coming from these original elements that God put into the earth now he's saying that sin came in and interrupted God's program but everything is he's still using things that God put here in the beginning they've just been perverted from their natural form now I I just feel that I've got to express this at this moment so that you could understand I'm I'm in no way just wanting to tickle your ears I I absolutely have no desire to impress you with message theology uh well maybe I wouldn't mind impressing you some but I certainly wouldn't want to only do that my desire is that the word of God could begin to permeate every thought that that as I expressed to the the young people at a graduation banquet here recently you're going to find God's glory in everyday life if you're gonna go out there you're gonna try to hunt it down on a Saturday night at the convention you're going to try to hunt it down over here and hunt it down over there and you want to find your glory in a church service you're going to miss most of God's glory because you're going to find God's glory in everyday life and what I would I would want is that these things would be because I believe this is what the message of the hour has done I I trust that what I'm I am is I'm a faithful Minister under the son of man under under a son of man Christ has been revealed by a prophet and I'm a minister under the under my messenger and I'm declaring to you I believe what has already been preached in its most simple way and this message talk a God who is boundless and put them in such simple terms so that we could find ourselves finding meaning in washing dishes planting potatoes loving our wives and I would that the word of God would begin to permeate or every thought just give uh have some give us purpose to motivate our action to begin to see God's purpose in everyday life when he says that our bodies come from the dust of the earth and God brought you here or you have to come out of this realm uh it's just by circumstance and happenstance and this is all a mistake I think one of the main things that we labored on when we ministered that first series here at the church as we wanted you to recognize that God was setting these things forth and what Satan did was to fulfill was to bring to pass that which was necessary and then you begin to see the whole plan of God and then you say well God you know what you're doing one thing I've been saying a lot to people as of late and whether it be in counseling and just encouraging is just remember God will have the final say and God did something very Supernatural for me I'm studying recently on something and I just wrote in my notes that the church the squirrels will chatter but the eagle will rise and I had it happen in in one in one day something happened and and I realized that's the chattering of the squirrel the chirping of the Chipmunk and as I was driving later on that day the closest an eagle has ever come to me I Saw an Eagle come down and grab which I'm going to say was A Chipmunk it was furry and then just rise up and flew away my wife was a witness to it just flew away right past me and I remembered the squirrels will chatter but the eagle will rise and listen let them chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp all they want to God will get the final say Amen and it doesn't have to be chirping back I know that's how they do it the great great the goats of these days know how to talk trash and and let's just say that the goat he is the greatest uh the greatest rebuttal he has is just to be gone and they're just like where'd they go hey God will get the final say so the enemy that sold it is sold it is the devil the wicked one sows this perversion in Eden ow so Genesis 3 1 we could say the devil is in the garden perverting the spoken word but as we read Matthew 13 God promises a harvest verse 41 the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all that offend whose kingdom his kingdom he is going to gather out anything that offends and then which do iniquity and so cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the Son and the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear Let Them hear now I think there's different ways that I one could apply those statements in different levels but notice how he says that he's going to gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and it's the devil that's done this so let's look there's going to be a harvest and in that Harvest there's a separation and there's a dealing with the tares and the seeds that have been sown and the perversion and iniquity and all that offends all those things are going to be gathered out they're going to be dealt with so in the Harvest he's extracting anything that doesn't fit the purpose of the original or does it find its place in God's program of redemption and so in Revelations chapter 20 verse 10 it says and the devil that deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire in Brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever do you recognize then what's transpiring is that just as the parable says that the wicked one who caused these things to offend God's going to deal with them and he's going to take out of the Kingdom anything that offends and he's going to cast The Devil into the Lake of Fire just as there's going to be a casting into a furnace of fire according to this parable and if I could say this the result of the Fall will be remedied will be dealt with will be addressed but God's word must be satisfied the Bible says that his word will not return void when God speaks it can never die it lives on and on and on therefore if I could say it this way Redemption is immutable if God's word will always live that means Redemption is necessary that's I I just I can't hold it back the things that the god laid out Abraham and his seed not just to tell a story but so that he could just lay out all the shadows and types and the seeds of redemption and he gave them rules and laws of Redemption how to redeem a a family member how to redeem a land how to redeem an inheritance it wasn't just there so that they could Israel would always have a kingdom and Israel would always be somebody but God is trying to say this Earth is mine and my the title deed may have been lost by man but I retain the rights to Redemption and the land shall not be sold forever I will get it back because the word requires it because God says when he speaks something it's that means Redemption is immutable it must happen and so then you could do as we did already with Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 and see the the seats come to fruition in the beginning look at how God deals with Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 3 verse 16 you can say sorrow is Born Into Humanity Revelations 21 4 there shall be no more sorrow because God is going to do what gather all things out of his kingdom that offends Satan brought sorrow God takes sorrow out in Revelations 21. Revelation Genesis 3 17 curse we saw those curses in Genesis Genesis 3 Revelations 22 3 there shall be no more curse in Genesis 3 lies sin murder intercreation what does verse 27 say no lie no Abomination no defilement shall enter what has God done everything that entered in God's just taken right out God had it framed his world perfect the seeds of the Kingdom Satan comes in and sows seeds into that Kingdom now in the end God is saying I've dealt with all of it I've taken it all out and he's Gathering out everything that offends Genesis 3 death enters Revelations 21 4 there shall be no more death Genesis 3 24 mankind is kept from the Tree of Life Revelations 22 2 the tree of life is in that City and they shall have a right to the Tree of Life in verse 14. it's showing that everything that this curse everything that the wicked one did and brought in the end God has reversed it why because Redemption is immutable God's word cannot be stopped I can't remember if it was you brother Michael that said it kind of does away with the chess match because people just have Gods over there at a chess board and he's put on he's made a move and then Satan makes a move and God's like and they're just kind of both watching the clock and looking at one another you know what God did he just set up the pieces and walked away from the board he's like do whatever you want do whatever you want to it this this this works by laws that you are only you are only going to operate to to achieve what I've already said in Emotion hallelujah it's a beautiful picture if you want to take your Bibles and look at it these things I'm sharing with you very quickly because it could just eat up so much time how the the son of man in his kingdom is gathering at all those things that offend and we see sown in Genesis 3 right back out in 21 and 22. now I want to give you a micro sermon no sermonette because I ain't a preacher at I'm gonna give you a micro sermon in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth John 1 when in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God I'm wanting you to think of and think of it I think this helps this is the way I began to look at it and help me I've got to think in terms of Christ that this one Christ that if I could see him in this then I would recognize that there's something about Christ that transcends because here he is he's standing there before before Abraham was I am right so that that transcends that's something that's Transcendent that means Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ is even something Beyond this Jesus of Nazareth because Paul says have I not met Jesus Christ Our Lord this is after that body has ascended on high so and when I begin to think of God wanting to make himself known and now Christ becomes this expression of that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God we traveled down several verses later and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and then we see in Revelations 21 verse 6 I'm just bringing this to this and he said unto me it is done it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth in the beginning was the word so now as these things are set forth no more curse no more death and this descriptions being given I am Alpha I am Omega I was in the beginning I am in the end let the Heathen rage all he wants to let the devil think he's winning battles let him sow all the tears he wants to I'm the beginning I'm the end I spoke in the beginning I'll be the one that remains an end let up let the chipmunks chirp all they want to in the end I'm the one that lasts I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is the thirst of the of the thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he's the beginning in the end he's the Alpha and the Omega he's the the root and offspring so in Christ is the mystery of God revealed when you read in the beginning God created there is Christ from that to the Amen in Revelations every word testifying of Jesus Christ when you read in the beginning there is Christ so when he puts that forth as Christ we say there is the original spoken word of God that is what God is and we realize you're in in him this is what God is setting forth Christ is represents a king of a kingdom there's this embodiment in his person and who he is and I can say that brother Bradman he preaches Christ the mystery God revealed that Christ is the mystery of Heaven he was there in the beginning but he's hidden from Satan if I could even put it this way that he that he laid it out in such a way that Satan was very quick to try to pervert God's program but God hid him God hid it from Satan because Satan didn't pervert that he didn't pervert the tree of life he was after it and he saw something in heaven that the woman represented so he went after her but God had you hidden in Christ who is the Tree of Life and Satan was trying to get to you and got to the woman Hallelujah but God all along kept the original [Applause] so the seeds of the Kingdom they're all in Genesis chapter 1. they're all in Genesis chapter 2. what if spoken cannot return void the Perfection must come now in Luke chapter 1 verse 20. I don't even know if I have some of these things in here because I just wanted to go through them quickly I believe it's from Zacharias doubted and and you go find where brother bam said this over and over and over again mostly in the mid 50s he said Thou shalt be dumb the angel and thou shalt not speak until the day that these things shall be performed this is the phrase of brother Branham uses because I believe it's not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season and look begin to look that up in their season in their season in its season there is a season God can speak his word and that seed is sung whatever life is in there it's got to come forth but it must happen in its season and the church age book he teaches that Christ is the perfect and complete thought expressed and it was manifested in its season you had glimpses you had foreshadowing but then it manifest in its season and the Rapture Brothers says God's word is original it's the word it has to bring forth It's Kind it's Genesis 111. it's kind in its season elected predestinated by the father it's all these things that God spoke in the beginning these seeds of the Kingdom we read that they ultimately come to their perfect maturity and their permanent Eternal maturity in Revelations 21 and 22 in the in the amen they're forever going to be because God's words must come to pass they must be it shall be fulfilled in its season so consider if I could say this the kingdom implications and for for heaven for Earth and listen the threefold purpose of God are the threefold purpose of Christ because if you come to that it's Christ you and Eden or if I could say this the Earth that he had a purpose in these things he had something he was wanting to accomplish something that he was going to achieve and so the seeds of the Kingdom they're coming to their fruit they're coming to their manifestation in the sermon the Mighty God unveiled before us he says now okay I'm going to stop let me take a deep breath I want to pick up I want to pick up on this I bet so I'm just gonna I'll let it I'll let you pull me wherever you want me to go with this but these really you know what I'm gonna do I'll have to ask the musicians to come that way everybody's gonna be like oh okay we're soon we're stopping but I want you to focus and musicians if you're able to multitask this would be a great time to do it now the word of God is a seed if I could even Orient you to what he's preaching here the date June 29th I guess that would be we'd be on an anniversary tomorrow and that's not what I was thinking about I was thinking of that wonderful summer of 64. and these things that brother branham's preaching and all these things that are leading up he's going to preach future home and he's going to be preaching all these tremendous messages he's breaking forth such important critical things in this season now the word of God is a seed and it can't bring forth until the sun strikes in go ahead think about it a little bit God speaks it in the beginning and he lays out all the material and he puts it all in there and you're still coming forth but somehow by Divine ordination that that the seed got to bring forth predestined by the father in its season and their seeds that are laying there that keep oh that just keep getting passed on I keep getting if I could just use that terminology until it lands in the ground in the season for the manifestation and it cannot manifest unless the Sun the son strikes it the sun has got to be upon the seed to make it bare to make it come forth Hallelujah then in this hour there's got to be an s-o-n rise there's got to be an s-o-n shine that's the only way you take the word take the word of God in your heart and walk into the Shekinah Glory and then when you do it'll bring so bread Manor that's the only give to the separated people the only thing that can eat it that's permitted to eat it it's just the people who are permitted and knows it and this is I kept reading it because this phrase Paul said changing from glory to glory you see finally it comes till it's back to its original Glory and I say Glory it's got to come back to its original Glory but it takes the sun to strike it now you recognize how important it is what the opening of the word it is the rising of the Sun what why it says you're laying in the presence of the sun to be ripened to bake all the greenness out and I think maybe we start thinking in terms of getting the greatness out but really what it is is it's this life coming into fullness it's Life coming in life manifesting so in the sermon it is the rising of the Sun it says the first light was ever given and the Earth was God's spoken word I I'm I'm using this to close the service this evening but I want to come back to these principles in this the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth the creation of joy and life upon the Earth are you entering into that just Channel yourselves in the beginning the creation then the spirit of God hasn't moved with love and compassion that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept across its rays and dried up the waters on the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed and he said that was a great hour you found it but oh it wasn't nothing wait what oh it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like sunrise on that Easter morning okay now that first time is amazing right the first sunrise the first the beauty that it swept out and began to bring all these spoken word seeds forth but he's saying oh it's nothing like the sunrise on Easter morning this time with the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater Sunrise than ever in other words oh Hallelujah the first Sunrise when it came up the devil's whoa look at that I could never do that that's beautiful and God's saying that even that ain't even going to be needed in the end are you with me oh that's beautiful God said just wait till the sun rises and he says oh that sign went leap disguise it brought forth the greater Sunrise Ezra ever because it came greater news with this Sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this Sunrise brought the news that he is he's quickened from the dead as he's promised he's risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the Earth more to life but this time when the sun rose he's preaching it is the rising of the sun recognize your day and its message he says it was this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising another son sunrising it was not only s-u-n Rising it was the s-o-n had risen listen to bring eternal life to All God's promise seed that by four nudge he had seen laid upon the Earth Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord I look silly right now looking at all of you looking at a mule at a new gate I think it's beautiful the say what God did in the beginning and just gives this Glimpse and he's saying this I'm just showing you in pre-figure what it looks like to sow seed and to create the silent for the sun to rise and seeds to come forth and what you're seeing now is only a type of what's gonna happen when the son Rises and all the seeds that I brought forth that are not trees that are not Palms that are not plants that are not herbs but my attributes laid in the earth and they'll come forth [Applause] Hallelujah it'll bring forth all God's promised seeds that by foreknowledge he had seen Lane upon the Earth Hallelujah Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord I just closed this with an amen with an amen that your word is true it is eternal Lord that these sayings are so vast that that I I admit I'm often reminded that's that was a lot that was a lot there was a lot there and Lord I I don't do it because I'm trying to challenge the people and I realize that maybe naturally our capacity is limited but I'm not just speaking to natural people I trust that as I preach the word there's Ray beams that there's beams of light that are being projected to seed and that the son is shining as Christ is preached and if he be lifted up it's going to draw draw out the life that is laying and the people that are here in your presence this evening and Lord I pray that as they have come and as they have heard the word that if they conceive themselves in the word of God tonight they would claim your word for whatever they have need of [Music] a lot that would they would find that you begin to permeate every thought and that in that Lord it would begin to become the buffer to our Humanity and when we find ourselves instinctively wanting to quit something inside of us pushes us Beyond it we find ourselves wanting to fire back a missive Lord we find ourselves something resisting that Lord why because I'm living under the laws of a greater Kingdom I'm being drawn and magnetized to something Beyond myself so Lord I pray May the so wind keep shining May the son keeps shining Lord may this great sunlight that's been revealed to us in this end time may it keep shining upon these seeds because it's bringing forth children of your kingdom Gathering not just the subjects but the the attributes of your kingdom to you Lord bless us tonight I pray that you bless your people Lord as we worship may you draw near to our hearts bless us with your presence oh how we love you father you're so kind to us Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
