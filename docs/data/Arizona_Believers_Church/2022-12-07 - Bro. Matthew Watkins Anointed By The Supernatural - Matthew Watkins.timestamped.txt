[0:01] praise the lord well we
[0:03] are here on this midweek service and so
[0:06] we'll be uh studious with our time and
[0:10] um
[0:10] and knowing that we just have tonight's
[0:12] service actually ministered what I'm
[0:14] going to minister tonight has just been
[0:15] burning upon my heart uh here just
[0:18] recently have only preached this just at
[0:19] home I believe uh and and just
[0:22] ministered over the last three services
[0:24] just on this thought that I'm going to
[0:26] speak tonight and so we just want to say
[0:29] What the Lord Has for us to say and I'd
[0:32] like to speak to you on anointed by the
[0:34] supernatural anointed by the
[0:36] supernatural second Kings chapter two
[0:38] let's just begin reading the verse one
[0:39] and it came to pass when the Lord would
[0:42] take up Elijah into world into Heaven by
[0:45] a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[0:48] from gilgall and Elijah said unto Elisha
[0:52] tarry here I pray thee for the Lord has
[0:55] sent me to Bethel and Elijah said unto
[0:57] him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:01] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[1:04] went down to Bethel and the sons of the
[1:07] prophets that were at Bethel came forth
[1:09] to Elijah and said unto him knowest thou
[1:11] that the Lord will take away thy master
[1:14] from the head today and he said yes I
[1:16] know it hold your peace and Elijah verse
[1:19] 4 said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray
[1:22] thee for the Lord has sent me to Jericho
[1:25] and he said as the Lord liveth and as
[1:29] thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so
[1:33] they came to Jericho
[1:35] let's just move on down to verse six and
[1:38] Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee
[1:40] here for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan
[1:43] and he said as the Lord liveth and as
[1:46] thy soul liveth I will not leave thee
[1:49] and they too went on and you moved on
[1:52] down to verse 8 and Elijah took his
[1:54] mantle and wrapped it together and smote
[1:56] the waters and they were divided hither
[1:58] and thither so that they too went over
[2:02] on thy grounds a scripture distinctly
[2:06] says in more than one place here as
[2:08] you've read if you've noticed they too
[2:10] they too both of them Elijah and Elisha
[2:13] they too went over on to dry ground and
[2:16] it came to pass when they were gone over
[2:18] that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I
[2:22] shall do for thee before I be taken away
[2:25] from thee in other words whatever you
[2:27] want Elijah and whatever you want Elisha
[2:29] the Lord's going to Grant it unto you
[2:31] and Elisha said I pray thee let alone
[2:35] double portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[2:39] this is to ask for your inheritance this
[2:41] is what he was asking and he said let a
[2:44] double portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[2:47] and he said thou is asked a hard thing
[2:50] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[2:53] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[2:56] but if not
[2:58] it shall not be so and it came to pass
[3:01] as they still went on and talked they
[3:04] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[3:05] and Horses of fire and parted them both
[3:08] asunder and Elijah went up by a
[3:11] whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it
[3:13] and he cried my father my father The
[3:15] Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[3:17] thereof and he saw him no more and he
[3:20] took hold of his own clothes and rent
[3:22] them in two pieces he took up also the
[3:25] mantle of Elijah that fell from him and
[3:28] went back and stood by the bank of
[3:30] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[3:33] that fell from him and smote the waters
[3:35] and said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[3:38] and when he also had smitten the waters
[3:40] they parted hither and thither and
[3:42] Elisha went over let's just bow our
[3:45] heads together maybe if you have a need
[3:47] something you just want the us as we
[3:49] pray just to remember why don't you just
[3:51] raise your hand to the Lord and say Lord
[3:52] here's my cup tonight may you just touch
[3:55] it Lord Jesus father I've got both of my
[3:58] hands up or just representative of how
[4:00] much Lord I need you now Lord there's
[4:03] not a one of us that have came and to
[4:05] this building tonight Lord that don't
[4:06] have a need Lord that doesn't have a
[4:09] desire Lord for something for you to do
[4:12] in her life Lord the needs would be to
[4:14] various Lord to Name Lord behind the
[4:17] hands of your children are
[4:18] representative Lord of different
[4:21] requests or maybe Lord something upon
[4:24] their heart that they've prayed about in
[4:26] this service or Lord throughout the week
[4:28] or some challenge that they're facing
[4:30] now Lord I pray Lord that you would just
[4:32] come down and do what I can't do Lord in
[4:35] this service tonight I pray father that
[4:37] you would come and break the bread of
[4:39] life to your children Lord may you feed
[4:41] us Lord with your word Lord I pray God
[4:44] that you would Grant every desire of
[4:46] every person Lord in this building here
[4:48] tonight God may you just have the
[4:50] preeminence Lord in all things that are
[4:52] said and done will give you the glory
[4:53] and the honor and all of the praise in
[4:55] Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be
[4:58] seated I almost titled this sermon
[5:02] the transfer of anointing and you can
[5:06] see why when we read this scripture here
[5:07] in Kings with Elijah and Elisha and it's
[5:11] amazing the parallel of these two men
[5:13] and their life and the Bible tells us
[5:16] here in Second Kings that Elijah's came
[5:19] to the end of his ministry it came to
[5:22] the very end of the road and you're
[5:24] witnessing as just like you did with
[5:27] David and that you have in the Bible the
[5:30] record of David's last words that David
[5:33] speaks and then you have the record of
[5:35] the last words of Solomon and now you
[5:38] have the last things that the Lord wants
[5:41] to say that Elijah has to say to Elisha
[5:44] this is some of the last burden or the
[5:47] last moments and these last days that he
[5:51] has here on Earth is going to turn into
[5:53] the last hours that he has and in the
[5:55] last minutes that he has I think it's
[5:58] incredible when you see this this the
[6:01] parallel of Eli and Elisha and Elijah
[6:05] takes him through this test through this
[6:07] journey you would call it wasn't just to
[6:09] reminisce or to go back to Nostalgia or
[6:12] places that were uh you know on some
[6:15] historic Journey but Elijah had a
[6:17] purpose in this because Elijah knew that
[6:20] the challenges that he had faced in his
[6:22] ministry and in his life Elisha would
[6:26] have to face those same challenges and
[6:28] so God has told him your ministry's over
[6:31] and and you're you're to cross the
[6:33] Jordan River and and he and before he
[6:36] goes to Jordan he brings him to Jericho
[6:38] and to Bethel and these two cities were
[6:41] highlights of the ministry of Elijah
[6:44] they were they were they were cities
[6:46] that God had done miraculous things
[6:48] through even the city of Bethel goes all
[6:51] the way back to Jacob and when Jacob
[6:53] dreams a dream and and he sees a vision
[6:55] of a ladder that goes from Earth to
[6:57] heaven and angels are ascending and
[7:00] descending and God says the Bible says
[7:02] Jacob woke up and he has a dream and he
[7:04] creates an alter him says surely the
[7:06] Lord is in this place and he calls the
[7:08] name of that City Bethel and then
[7:11] through Elijah's Ministry there's going
[7:13] to be miraculous things that take place
[7:15] there and and and then he takes him to
[7:17] Jericho and and Elijah's Minister
[7:19] Jericho was also a highlight city of of
[7:23] Revival you could call it that it broke
[7:26] out uh in the city of Jericho and in the
[7:29] city of Bethel but now at the end of his
[7:31] ministry both of these cities are
[7:34] backslidden they're they're they're evil
[7:37] uh there's there's a an altar that's
[7:39] been uh uh erected there that's not to
[7:43] the god of Jehovah and Elijah Elijah
[7:45] brings him to these two cities he asked
[7:48] him it's uh in verse 9 if you just hold
[7:50] your place open there he asks him and he
[7:53] says what shall I do for thee before I
[7:55] be taken from thee and without any
[7:58] hesitation at all Elisha says that a
[8:01] double portion of your spirit would come
[8:03] upon me that the anointing that's upon
[8:06] you would come upon my life because
[8:08] Elisha knew the challenge is that you
[8:11] faced in your ministry are not the same
[8:14] challenges I'll face because now Jericho
[8:18] is worse off than when you preach to
[8:20] Jericho and Bethel is worse off than
[8:23] when you preach to Bethel the hearts of
[8:25] the Young Generation of men and people
[8:28] are are evil to such a place that I'm
[8:31] not just going to need the power or
[8:34] anointing that you had to face your
[8:37] challenge but I'm going to need twice
[8:39] what you had
[8:40] to face my challenge
[8:43] and he says you've asked Elijah you've
[8:46] asked a hard thing now it wasn't hard
[8:48] for God and it certainly wasn't hard for
[8:50] Elijah here Elijah's leaving the scene
[8:52] he's about to go on a chariot and he's
[8:55] about to go to his reward so it's not a
[8:57] hard thing for God it's not a hard thing
[8:59] for for Elijah but the hard thing is
[9:03] going to be for Elisha
[9:05] in other words what you've asked for a
[9:07] double portion it's going to be a hard
[9:10] thing Elisha it's not going to be an
[9:12] easy life it's not just going to be a
[9:14] life of sensation it's not going to be
[9:16] his life of just power all the time it's
[9:19] not going to be a life of just success
[9:21] or Victory all the time but you've asked
[9:24] for a hard thing the mantle that the
[9:26] anointing that I have and it's
[9:28] incredible because there is nothing in
[9:31] particular about this mantle whatever it
[9:33] was a long flowing garment if you click
[9:35] on the the word they're using the King
[9:37] James it was like a long flowing mantle
[9:40] or a long flowing garment that Elijah
[9:42] war and there was nothing necessarily
[9:44] unearthly about the fabric nothing was
[9:48] really special about the the way it was
[9:50] stitched or the colors of the mantle
[9:53] that he had there was no special
[9:54] uniqueness or power to the mantle that
[9:58] he wore but but the fabric but but what
[10:01] was special was The Inheritance or the
[10:05] blessing that God had saturated that
[10:09] mantle with and he lined his life there
[10:11] was a purpose or a promise I want to
[10:14] just bring you because I preached this
[10:15] over Parts I'm skipping so much but I
[10:18] just want to bring you right to with me
[10:19] so just stay right with me here tonight
[10:22] and so what was special was the The
[10:25] Inheritance that or the promise or the
[10:28] anointing that was upon the Garment
[10:31] listen to what brother Brandon says here
[10:32] and you can just display those and I'll
[10:34] control it here if I can listen to what
[10:36] brother Brandon says here in this
[10:37] message why Christ speak he says may the
[10:40] Holy Spirit teach us today the things
[10:42] that we ought to know and may we then in
[10:45] return listen closely to every word and
[10:50] weigh it deeply and then may those who
[10:53] are listening by the way of tape may
[10:55] they listen close and may we be able to
[10:59] catch what the holy spirit is trying to
[11:03] reveal to us that's why I said you can
[11:05] hear how many times brother Brandon
[11:06] would say don't miss it the Lord's
[11:08] trying to speak the Lord is always
[11:10] speaking let me just stop and say that
[11:12] the holy spirit is always and has always
[11:16] a message that he's trying to get across
[11:18] to you he's trying to get across to his
[11:21] church he's trying to get across to his
[11:23] people and you as an individual the Lord
[11:26] has something he's trying to speak and I
[11:29] just say Lord don't let me Miss what
[11:31] you're trying to say for my life
[11:35] the way brother random says this may we
[11:37] be able to catch it what the holy spirit
[11:39] is trying to reveal to us for we realize
[11:42] if he should anoint us then the
[11:45] anointing is not in vain it's for a
[11:49] purpose
[11:51] that it might work to the good to the
[11:53] Lord and may our hearts and
[11:55] understanding be open Lord
[11:58] so he says let this anointing he knows
[12:00] Lord let us catch it let us hear every
[12:03] word let us be in tune let us be in
[12:07] harmony let us be in sync with right now
[12:12] not with what you not not yesterday not
[12:14] last year not 40 years ago but let me
[12:18] let my heart be in sync with what the
[12:21] holy spirit is doing right now Lord I
[12:23] want to know what are you doing where
[12:25] are you moving what is happening now
[12:27] Lord I there there's there's a there's a
[12:30] a there is there's an act there's an
[12:33] activity or a or or an action or a plan
[12:37] that's developing or unfolding
[12:40] and I want to be right in the middle of
[12:42] it Lord
[12:43] and he says then the Lord would send us
[12:45] we realize if he should anoint us then
[12:48] the anointing I'm preaching to you
[12:50] tonight on anointed by the Supernatural
[12:53] and he says he should anoint us then the
[12:56] anointing is not in vain so you take
[12:59] this word anointing and I'm not using it
[13:01] in the way that the charismatic church
[13:04] has so used this word anointing and you
[13:07] could almost just turn into any uh
[13:09] Pentecostal uh charismatic group and
[13:13] they would use this uh this word
[13:15] anointing you know that and it's almost
[13:17] like this this feeling or you feel the
[13:19] anointing or this this this uh this warm
[13:22] fuzziness that you feel or the sensation
[13:25] or this but do you know the Bible
[13:26] actually had a meaning of of what the
[13:29] anointing was and the anointing wasn't
[13:32] just a filling or something that you
[13:34] felt or an outward Sensation that you
[13:36] could say I'm singing and I feel the
[13:38] anointing or I felt the anointing in the
[13:41] service and I felt the I felt the
[13:43] sensation or the inspiration but
[13:46] actually in the Bible the word anointing
[13:48] means to smear or to rub with oil
[13:53] and so it means to smear or to
[13:56] consecrate for an office or for a
[13:59] service you would also have it in the
[14:02] Bible they would anoint uh with oil to
[14:05] signify a blessing or it was to signify
[14:08] a blessing that the Lord was wanting to
[14:10] transfer so the Lord had a purpose the
[14:13] Lord had a vision the Lord had a burden
[14:15] the Lord had something upon his heart
[14:17] that he wanted to say to his people so
[14:19] what would God do God would take a man
[14:21] like Jeremiah and God would anoint him
[14:24] what was he doing when he was anointing
[14:26] him he wasn't just giving him magic
[14:28] power it wasn't just some kind of Hocus
[14:30] Pocus that he put upon Jeremiah's life
[14:32] but if God was literally taking his
[14:36] burden or his purpose and transferring
[14:40] it to a human being named Jeremiah and
[14:43] he would saturate that man with his
[14:46] purpose and his message and when
[14:48] Jeremiah spoke he wasn't speaking his
[14:51] own thoughts or his own word but the
[14:54] purpose of this of what Jeremiah said
[14:56] was to translate or transfer the heart
[14:59] of God to a generation of people so when
[15:02] you rejected Jeremiah you weren't
[15:04] rejecting Jeremiah when you denied
[15:07] Jeremiah and you mocked Jeremiah you
[15:09] weren't mocking Jeremiah you were
[15:12] mocking Jehovah because Jeremiah Was
[15:14] Anointed with the message from Jehovah
[15:17] so to it to accept Jeremiah Was to
[15:20] accept the message of the Lord
[15:22] and so brother Madam says what was it he
[15:24] says to anoint us with the purpose so it
[15:27] meant an oil that would be rubbed or it
[15:30] would be smeared it was it was
[15:32] representative of something of maybe a
[15:35] special purpose to be a prophet or to be
[15:38] a builder or to be a king whatever it
[15:40] was they would take the oil and they
[15:42] would pour it upon the priest even Aaron
[15:45] The Pride priest was anointed with oil
[15:47] and that oil was representative of a
[15:50] transferring of the purpose that God had
[15:53] so it would go from purpose to promise
[15:57] to person
[15:59] that's why when we anoint you with oil
[16:02] and you come up for prayer there's no
[16:05] special power with the oil there's no
[16:07] kind of special kind of oil that brother
[16:09] Aaron Or whoever it is that buys the
[16:11] anointing oil you don't go through you
[16:13] buy olive oil but you don't go through
[16:14] and you know pay for some kind of holy
[16:16] water or some preacher that prayed over
[16:19] it or some some great dignitary there's
[16:21] nothing special about the oil itself but
[16:25] it's representing a promise that Jesus
[16:29] made and so that oil takes the place or
[16:32] transfers the promise that your faith in
[16:36] the Bible would come to pass in your
[16:38] life so when we pray for you and we
[16:40] anoint you with oil we're obeying the
[16:43] Bible when it said let the Elders of the
[16:45] church anoint them which are sick with
[16:47] oil and they shall be healed so where is
[16:50] your faith in not an oil that has some
[16:52] special power but your faith is in the
[16:55] promise that's in the Bible that that
[16:57] promise would be transferred all of the
[17:00] paper into your heart
[17:03] that's why we pray and we speak to the
[17:05] devil and say take your hands off of
[17:08] God's Property in the name of the Lord
[17:10] Jesus Christ it isn't any special kind
[17:13] of words that I'm speaking I'm only
[17:15] having faith in the promise that God
[17:18] gave
[17:20] and so that anointing was an oil that
[17:23] was rubbed or it was smeared I think of
[17:25] Psalms I think it's 131 when David says
[17:28] how precious it is for the Brethren to
[17:31] dwell in unity and he says it's like the
[17:35] oil that flowed from Aaron's head and it
[17:39] went on to his beard and it flowed from
[17:41] his beard onto his skirts and his
[17:43] garments and it flowed from his skirts
[17:46] and his garments all the way down to his
[17:48] feet do you realize that this was the
[17:51] high priest that was going to make
[17:53] atonement for the entire Kingdom or
[17:56] nation of Israel and God was going to
[17:59] represent that the anointing or the
[18:01] purpose or the promise that God had
[18:05] wasn't just going to stay on the head of
[18:07] Aaron as miter but it would move from
[18:10] his head to his beard and that oil would
[18:13] then flow from his beard to the urum and
[18:15] the thumb and what was in the urim and
[18:17] thumbem was the topaz and carmuncle and
[18:20] so artists and Jasper which was what
[18:22] representing people
[18:26] those were stones that represented
[18:28] families they represented young people
[18:31] they represented old people they
[18:33] represented the church they represented
[18:35] the strong they represented the weak
[18:37] they represented the healthy they
[18:39] represented the diseased the anointing
[18:42] was going from the head and it would
[18:44] move all the way through the body I hope
[18:47] you can be spiritual to catch it tonight
[18:49] God was not just going to anoint
[18:51] preachers this isn't just a preacher's
[18:54] Revival this isn't just a preachers let
[18:56] me go further it's not just a prophet's
[18:58] Revival it wasn't just a prophet's
[19:00] anointing but that anointing would have
[19:03] to transfer from a promise to a prophet
[19:06] to a microphone to your body to your
[19:08] ears and your faith would reach a hold
[19:11] and take a hold of that promise
[19:13] and that anointing would have to
[19:15] transfer from a prophet to a people
[19:21] it's incredible just I don't want to get
[19:24] ahead of myself here and I want to make
[19:26] sure I just am and sensitive to what the
[19:29] Lord wants us to catch and what he wants
[19:30] us to move over but it's incredible that
[19:33] this is the prayer that Elisha prays and
[19:36] he says Lord let that he prays this to
[19:39] his request to Elijah let a double
[19:42] portion
[19:43] in other words that promise not just not
[19:47] just the not just your power not just
[19:49] the you know the mesmerizing you can
[19:51] imagine Elisha would just enamored by
[19:54] the ministry of Elijah you can imagine
[19:57] just the Miracles of the miraculous that
[20:00] he witnessed in the life of this man
[20:04] and so much that he would go to Jericho
[20:06] and he would go to Bethel and he would
[20:07] say you know Elisha you you know you
[20:11] should you should just pastor this
[20:13] people
[20:14] it'd make a good one
[20:16] you want to use you to stop here this
[20:18] Jericho you know he could see the the
[20:21] Rebellion he could see the the
[20:23] wickedness in in Jericho he could see
[20:27] the hard-heartedness of the people I
[20:29] mean look the generation of people were
[20:31] mocking God's profit in so much they ran
[20:33] him out of the city just a few days
[20:34] later
[20:35] this was a hard-hearted group of people
[20:37] even the generation of young people it
[20:41] was worse in Elisha's Ministry than in
[20:43] Elijah's and they come and visit the
[20:45] city and Elijah says you know you should
[20:48] just settle down here Elisha you know
[20:50] build a home buy you some land you know
[20:53] you'd make a good you'd make a good
[20:55] pastor Elijah you should do Elisha you
[20:57] should just stay here Elisha says as the
[21:00] Lord liveth
[21:01] and as my soul liveth
[21:03] I ain't going nowhere
[21:06] I'm going to stay with you why because
[21:08] what did Elisha understand until I have
[21:12] what you have until the power or the
[21:15] anointing that's on your mantle
[21:17] transfers to me I'll never meet the
[21:20] challenge of Jericho that I face in my
[21:23] life
[21:24] I'll never until the promise of the word
[21:28] comes off of the pages and moves into my
[21:32] life
[21:33] I'm staying with the prophet I'm staying
[21:35] right beside you
[21:37] so notice this here he goes further and
[21:41] he takes him to Bethel and I want you to
[21:43] notice I'm just going to back up here
[21:44] just for a moment and parallel this with
[21:47] the life of Moses listen to what brother
[21:48] Brandon talks about with Moses he says
[21:50] here in the message why Christ speak
[21:53] knows how to do these things and how to
[21:56] deal with man he knows what's in man
[22:02] he knows
[22:03] what's in you
[22:05] you may think you know what God put
[22:07] inside of you you may think you know you
[22:09] but ultimately your creator knows you
[22:12] because he's the one who plays something
[22:15] inside of you and you may feel like a
[22:17] nobody and a nothing but if God put
[22:19] deposited something inside of you then
[22:22] God knows what's done on the inside of
[22:24] you
[22:24] he knows what's in him we don't we only
[22:28] know from the intellectual side
[22:30] he knows what's really in the man
[22:34] Moses was born in this world A Gifted
[22:37] boy he was born to be a prophet a
[22:39] deliverer he was born I love this with
[22:42] the equipment borned in him
[22:45] as every man that comes into the world
[22:47] is born with this equipment Moses born
[22:51] and then he was afterwards he was wrote
[22:53] to the place where he was anointed and
[22:56] notice the seed I hope you catch this I
[22:59] hope I hope you hope you don't miss it
[23:01] here tonight
[23:02] notice he says he came to the place
[23:05] where he was anointed so he backs up he
[23:07] says he knew this intellectually he had
[23:09] the equipment inside of him God had
[23:11] placed everything Moses needed to be
[23:14] Moses he placed everything that he
[23:16] needed for every challenge God would
[23:18] bring in his life for every hard time he
[23:21] brought in his life for every trial he
[23:24] would bring in Moses's life God already
[23:26] put the equipment inside of him to face
[23:29] every single one of them
[23:32] brother Brandon says but he only knew
[23:34] this intellectually he already had the
[23:36] equipment inside of him he was born
[23:39] afterwards he was brought to the place
[23:40] where he was anointed and notice the
[23:43] seed laying there with an intellectual
[23:46] conception
[23:47] with all the faith that he was born to
[23:50] deliver this people now we can mean this
[23:52] in a negative way when we say
[23:53] intellectual conception we're not for in
[23:56] just an intellectual dry-eyed confession
[23:58] that's not what we preach that's not
[23:59] what we believe we believe there has to
[24:01] be a real born-again experience but this
[24:04] isn't what brother branham's talking
[24:05] about he's not referring to this in a
[24:07] negative way he's saying he knew this
[24:09] intellectually
[24:11] in other words he had been taught it
[24:13] he had been told it he had been trained
[24:16] it had been trained unto him he knew he
[24:18] was the deliverer he knew the job that
[24:21] God had him for to do he knew it by an
[24:22] intellectual conception with all the
[24:25] faith listen with all the faith that he
[24:27] was born to deliver this people and yet
[24:30] it never come to life until that light
[24:34] from the burning bush flashed across it
[24:38] until he's seen not something he read
[24:43] about but something he's seen with his
[24:46] eyes
[24:48] not something he just read about but
[24:51] something he has seen with his eyes
[24:53] something Moses experienced he was told
[24:57] it it was trained he was told he was
[24:59] preached to he accepted intellectually
[25:02] in his mind but brother Brandon says but
[25:04] yet there was still something missing he
[25:07] had to see it for himself
[25:09] oh Hallelujah he had to see it for
[25:12] himself until he seen not something he
[25:15] read about but something he's seen
[25:17] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[25:20] back to it oh I just read that and I
[25:23] said Lord give me an experience that I
[25:25] speak to it and it speaks back to me
[25:27] give my children an experience not just
[25:31] a church experience not just a good
[25:33] Christian experience but let him know a
[25:35] God that they speak to and that God
[25:37] speaks back to them
[25:40] brother man says oh how that did bring
[25:42] things to life
[25:43] I think any man or woman boy or girl I
[25:48] think in an intellectual conception of
[25:50] what they think the word is and so forth
[25:53] can never have a full Foundation stand
[25:57] until they have met that light that
[26:02] brings that word to a reality
[26:07] you say then what can a parent do
[26:10] all a parent can do is teach them train
[26:13] them tell them
[26:15] teach them train them tell them and put
[26:19] your faith that there's a seed inside of
[26:21] their heart and so long as you sow the
[26:24] right thing into them when the light
[26:26] flashes across that seed it'll come to
[26:29] life
[26:31] brother Adam says now hundreds and
[26:33] hundreds of years
[26:38] but germ be mistreated in a strange
[26:40] country and would stay there 400 years
[26:42] but God with the mighty hand would bring
[26:44] them out so you see with this Burning
[26:46] Bush just as we know now as a man asked
[26:50] me a few moments ago about the coming
[26:51] and the Rapture it's incredible here
[26:53] that as you read this what why Christ
[26:56] speak brother by Adam's dealing with
[26:57] this Moses he had an intellectual
[26:59] conception he was told he illustrates
[27:02] the story to the kids about djokabed and
[27:04] brother random goes through the entire
[27:05] drama of that and he says but yet
[27:07] something was lacking yet he had never
[27:09] met the burning bush there came a point
[27:11] to when he was anointed there came a
[27:13] point where he was different than the
[27:15] Moses who just knew it intellectually
[27:17] and then when he met the burning bush
[27:19] and God lit that faith on fire brother
[27:22] Brandon jumps and goes just like a man
[27:24] ask me a few moments ago about the
[27:28] coming and the rapture we know we've
[27:31] lived the time out at the time of the
[27:33] Rapture is at hand and we're looking
[27:37] we're looking
[27:40] not just waiting
[27:42] not just on our doldrums not just
[27:44] sitting around on autopilot but even the
[27:47] prophet of God would join himself and
[27:49] say we're looking in other words we're
[27:52] reaching come on somebody help me preach
[27:55] here we're looking we're reaching I'm
[27:57] not just sitting my heart is longing for
[27:59] a rapturing faith it's something I'm
[28:02] reaching out for that's why brother
[28:04] random says I'm reaching out for it my
[28:06] hand is outstretched I'm looking for a
[28:09] rapturing faith
[28:12] amen that can pull the church together
[28:14] and give it some Supernatural strength
[28:19] is that what you're looking for
[28:21] that can change these bodies that we
[28:25] live in
[28:26] when we see a God that can raise the
[28:28] dead off the floor or out of the yard
[28:31] and bring him back to life again and
[28:34] present him before us when we see a God
[28:37] who can take a cancer that's ate a man
[28:40] to a shadow and raise him up to a strong
[28:44] healthy man
[28:46] that ought to make a shout that ought to
[28:49] make us be thankful that ought to bring
[28:52] us bring us some Joy listen when God
[28:54] heals a person when God heals you of
[28:56] sickness that ought to make you happy
[28:58] that ought to make you shout that ought
[29:00] to make you rejoice but listen to what
[29:01] brother random says it ought to do and
[29:03] ought to give rapturing Faith to the
[29:05] people
[29:07] do you realize what the prophet of God
[29:09] is saying what ought to give rapturing
[29:12] faith when God could take a man who who
[29:15] the doctors have given up on and it
[29:18] seemed impossible and could heal him of
[29:20] cancer that ought to give you rapturing
[29:23] faith that no matter how impossible your
[29:26] situation looks even to the point to
[29:29] where you've given up on yourself
[29:32] and brother Brandon says that ought to
[29:35] give us rapturing faith when we see a
[29:37] what brother Matt a miracle
[29:40] when we see something that's impossible
[29:43] to man
[29:45] but God does it anyway
[29:48] and what seemed impossible
[29:50] what man said was impossible God just
[29:53] did it anyway
[29:55] do you see what the body change the
[29:57] Rapture in faith is
[29:59] brother Brandon says it this way the
[30:01] Saint the holy ghost that God placed
[30:03] inside of you that anoints the seed life
[30:06] of God in that seed is everything you
[30:12] have need of for this life's journey
[30:15] even a rapture
[30:18] brother Brandon says that all
[30:25] that you did
[30:26] and bring him back to life again present
[30:28] him before us when we see a God who can
[30:31] take a cancer that's ate a man to a
[30:33] shadow and raise him to a strong healthy
[30:36] man that ought to give us Rapture and
[30:38] faith I just witnessed this just just a
[30:41] week just a month ago came to a man back
[30:44] home this man was an associate pastor
[30:47] what they call a Vineyard Church it's
[30:49] just a non-denominational Evangelical
[30:51] Church and this is Marcus Humphrey a man
[30:54] a wonderful Christian man and there's a
[30:57] brother in our church who some of you
[30:58] may know brother Travis Jackson he
[31:00] actually traveled here with us brother
[31:02] Dallas his father-in-law and brother
[31:04] Travis was on a journey to find the
[31:06] truth never wasn't he he was mom and dad
[31:09] was raised uh raised that raised him in
[31:12] the Beaufort Baptist Church and when his
[31:14] entire life looking for the truth had
[31:15] read the book of Acts had read about the
[31:18] supernatural power of God and begin to
[31:20] ask his parents begin to the one went
[31:22] from his parents and he went to his
[31:23] youth leader and he says why don't we
[31:25] see the thought of the Bible well what
[31:27] do you mean brother what do you mean
[31:29] Travis surely you read the Bible it says
[31:31] yeah but where do you see the these men
[31:33] that are filled with the Holy Ghost that
[31:36] I read about in the Bible where do you
[31:38] see this God who's moving and and
[31:40] operating in a church body or people
[31:43] have faith for Supernatural things and
[31:45] that you know what brother Travis on a
[31:48] on a journey in his life you know what
[31:50] brother Travis testimony if he was here
[31:52] tonight to give you his testimony he
[31:54] loves to tell and I love to hear it that
[31:56] those youth leaders and pastors would
[31:59] always say the same exact thing brother
[32:01] Travis you have to understand the age of
[32:05] the Apostles is over
[32:07] and the days of Miracles are over now
[32:10] that's exactly what they told brother
[32:11] Brandon when they would say the days of
[32:12] Miracles are passed and brother Brandon
[32:15] says anytime you appropriate a promise
[32:16] of the Bible to some other age you're
[32:18] under a delusion
[32:21] and brother Travis would say that's
[32:22] impossible I read about it right here in
[32:24] the Bible all the days of Miracles he
[32:26] goes on this little journey and he says
[32:28] he's in his mom's room and and he's
[32:30] going through her closet looking through
[32:32] some of the books that she had and he's
[32:34] reading any kind of spiritual book that
[32:36] she'd have and he suddenly stumbles upon
[32:38] a book doesn't even to this day doesn't
[32:40] know how a God in his mom's closet and
[32:42] he stumbles on a book the acts of the
[32:44] Prophet written by Perry green
[32:47] and he starts to go through this book he
[32:49] comes to his mom and he says mom where
[32:51] did you find this book he says this is
[32:54] this is the this is the the life of a
[32:56] man I've been looking for and she said I
[32:59] don't even know it was torn up the the
[33:01] spine was completely gone from the from
[33:03] the book it was just some pages of the
[33:05] book I'm not sure and then then she she

[33:14] a reception for a plumbing receptionist
[33:16] for a plumbing company and he says

[36:04] three months passed by and brother
[36:06] Travis three or four months after that
[36:07] brother Travis calls me and he says hey
[36:09] I got some really disappointing news he
[36:11] says that you remember Marcus the man
[36:13] that you met and I said yeah yeah the
[36:15] pastor associate pastor said yeah he
[36:17] said he's been diagnosed with stage four
[36:19] Hodgkin's lymphoma Non-Hodgkin's
[36:21] lymphoma and he said in the Mary just
[36:23] called me broken up saying they've told
[36:25] him he's going to die he doesn't have
[36:27] you know maybe but three or four months
[36:29] to live and and and it's just horrible
[36:31] and and I said oh Travis that's you know
[36:33] terrible he said well he said will you
[36:35] go with me would you go and he actually
[36:37] asked all the minister brethren in our
[36:38] church he said would you go with us with
[36:40] me to lay my layer hands upon Marcus and
[36:43] pray for him that God will Supernatural
[36:45] heal him and I said absolutely just so
[36:47] happens that day uh it was a Saturday
[36:49] early morning none of the other brothers
[36:51] could go I just went by myself with him
[36:53] and go to Marcus's house and this is the
[36:55] man that I seen a man that was had a
[36:57] tumor the size of a grapefruit you could
[36:59] see it there on his neck just on his own
[37:02] on his on his body and he you know
[37:04] walked into his living room and you know
[37:07] I had just been studying actually to
[37:09] preach the message this is just
[37:11] Supernatural the way the Lord moves I
[37:13] was studying to preach that Sunday and
[37:15] my entire message came out of the book
[37:18] what cancer is
[37:21] the book healing healing what cancer is
[37:24] and I had went over everything that
[37:25] brother random talks about the life of a
[37:27] tumor how that that tumor is just a life
[37:29] uh that he that there's a life living in
[37:32] that tumor the tumor is just a body and
[37:34] you remember how brother Brandon breaks
[37:35] that down and he says there's a life
[37:37] living there and he says that and he
[37:39] said and that life is living off your
[37:40] life trying to suck your life out trying
[37:42] to kill you and the doctors if they can
[37:45] go in and remove a tumor and with their
[37:46] tools and they can remove everything
[37:47] then that's wonderful but brother
[37:49] Brandon says but when Jesus in Mark 9
[37:52] spoke to the deaf and dumb man he didn't
[37:54] say thou deaf disease but he said thou
[37:57] deaf spirit
[37:59] come out of the man and don't enter him
[38:02] again identifying that it was a demon it
[38:04] was a life and so we go into this man's
[38:06] living room and and and there's another
[38:08] family there as a trustee from his
[38:11] church and their her the him and his
[38:13] wife she had lost her son at 16 years
[38:15] old to brain cancer she's a cancer
[38:17] Advocate there they were in the living
[38:18] room and here he is and we sit down and
[38:21] Travis begins to talk to him and and he
[38:23] just begins to say well you know it's a
[38:25] point and then the man wants to die and
[38:27] and you know it's just Travis this isn't
[38:29] the way I wanted to wanted to to die and
[38:32] the doctors have given up hope and you
[38:34] know it was just resigning to this to
[38:36] the fact that he was going to die and
[38:38] and he and Travis says so that's what it
[38:40] that's how bad it is he said yeah it's
[38:41] stage four you know Non-Hodgkin's
[38:44] lymphoma and they've tried chemo four
[38:46] times it's failed all four times and you
[38:49] know and he says I you know I just uh
[38:51] it's just the way that it is brother
[38:52] Travis stopped right there I didn't have
[38:54] no idea what he was going to say
[38:56] and he said you know Marcus he said
[38:58] because of that he said I just figure I
[39:02] can't really uh I got to be real honest
[39:04] with you and he said I just I figure I
[39:07] just need to be real straight up with
[39:08] you you know with this kind of diagnosis
[39:10] he said I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
[39:12] say what's upon my heart and what the
[39:14] Lord told me to say
[39:15] and he said you know he said Marcus when
[39:17] I was at your church I was searching and
[39:20] he said I was searching for the truth
[39:22] and he said and I came to your church
[39:24] and he said you're wonderful people I
[39:25] believe you're God you're God's family
[39:27] and your Christian people and he says
[39:29] but I was searching for more than just a
[39:31] an education about the Bible I was
[39:34] searching more than just a understanding
[39:36] or a teaching of theology I was I was
[39:39] look I was searching for a God that I
[39:41] could talk to a god that was alive
[39:42] that's exactly what he told him he said
[39:44] I was searching for a living God and he
[39:46] said I was searching for a God that
[39:48] still was alive still healed there were
[39:50] still Miracles there were still
[39:51] Supernatural there was still a God who
[39:54] could answer prayer and he said and he
[39:56] said and I found that God Marcus I left
[39:58] your church in the Lord led me to the
[40:00] truth that God has restored the the the
[40:03] the original Apostolic Faith with
[40:06] Apostolic power to a to a people to his
[40:10] elected and he's not in your dead he's
[40:12] exactly what he told me he said he's not
[40:14] in your denomination your denomination
[40:15] is dead he's not in the Trinity of God
[40:18] and I was sitting there going oh my
[40:19] goodness he is laying it all out I mean
[40:22] he was as bold you want to talk about
[40:24] bold faith
[40:26] I told him after he got in the car said
[40:28] man if I was ever in a foxhole buddy I'd
[40:30] want you right behind me
[40:33] just a warrior and he said he's not in
[40:36] the Trinity Marcus that's a that's a
[40:37] that's a that's a false interpretation
[40:39] of the Bible he's one God and that's a
[40:42] that's a demon spirit that that's that's
[40:44] the doctrine of devils and he said and
[40:47] he said he's a living God he's not in
[40:49] your denomination and if you'll accept
[40:50] this if you'll believe that God can
[40:53] touch you and heal your body and he said
[40:55] we're going to pray for you and I
[40:57] brought a minister from our church here
[40:59] and he introduces me and you know and
[41:02] I'm already tense thinking oh boy you
[41:04] know I don't even know if he's going to
[41:06] hear anything I have to say
[41:07] and Travis says now Marcus he says I
[41:10] hope that nothing I said offended you
[41:13] he said I hope nothing he said I hope
[41:16] nothing I said offended you and he said
[41:17] I hope it nothing what I was I was never
[41:19] trying to offend you he said I just
[41:21] wanted to be real honest with you he
[41:23] said because I feel like that's what you
[41:24] need right now you're you're not he says
[41:27] your doctors have given up on you
[41:30] and he says but Jesus isn't given up on
[41:32] you
[41:33] and he's still alive
[41:36] and Marcus just bowed his head and he
[41:38] said no Travis He said nothing that you
[41:41] said offended me at all and he said the
[41:43] only reason is is because when you
[41:45] knocked on my door and you and this man
[41:47] that came with you when you knocked on
[41:49] my door and Mary got up to go answer the
[41:51] door and she went downstairs a voice
[41:53] spoke to me audibly and said these are
[41:55] men sent from God heed what they have to
[41:58] say
[42:00] and he said so I was prepared for
[42:02] anything you would say
[42:04] and so I began to just minister to him
[42:06] and all I did was just take everything
[42:07] brother Branham and taught about cancer
[42:09] he began to tell us and show us his pet
[42:12] scan uh that you could see the tumor
[42:14] there normally in a pet scan you can see
[42:16] organs you can see the heart would be
[42:18] black you could see that lungs you could
[42:20] see the kidneys but here you can't see
[42:22] any of that all you see is cancer and
[42:24] that cancer that had started on his on
[42:27] his neck had now moved into his bowels
[42:29] and it moved from his bowels all the way
[42:30] down into his legs had tumors on the
[42:33] back of his calves he had tumors
[42:34] everywhere just ate up his entire body
[42:37] and Mary brought his cats his pet scan
[42:39] over and showed me and I said you know
[42:41] let me just let me just tell you that
[42:43] that life that's living on you Marcus is
[42:46] a it's a life that's trying to trying to
[42:48] kill your life he's trying to destroy
[42:50] you he's trying to suck the life out of
[42:51] you
[42:52] and I just begin to testify to him I
[42:54] said there's a sister named sister Elena
[42:57] and I said I know her know her and her
[42:59] family very well from Louisiana and I
[43:01] said she was diagnosed with the very
[43:04] same disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[43:06] stage four and I said let me show you
[43:09] Mary her pet scan and I pulled out my
[43:11] phone and I'm comparing and she's there
[43:13] his wife's looking of her Pet's cancer
[43:15] Elena's looks very similar to to
[43:17] Marcus's I said just black with cancer
[43:19] and I said but I want to testify to you
[43:21] about a living God who still answers
[43:23] prayer and I flipped the screen and I
[43:25] said here's her pet skin now after God
[43:27] touched her
[43:29] and you could see Elena's pet scan is
[43:31] completely clear of cancer you could
[43:33] just feel the atmosphere as she looked
[43:35] at that image and and and you can feel
[43:38] the atmosphere and she said she said I
[43:40] want to tell you she said I've never
[43:41] heard anybody ever explain a demon
[43:45] Spirit like that she said but that's
[43:47] what I believe that's exactly what the
[43:49] Bible says and she said do you believe
[43:51] Marcus can be touched the same way and I
[43:53] said I believe the Lord can do anything
[43:55] and nothing's impossible for God we
[43:58] begin to take you can feel the
[43:59] atmosphere change in that room you can
[44:01] feel Marcus's Faith completely changed
[44:03] we went over and laid our hands upon him
[44:05] I'll never forget praying I said Lord
[44:08] just as Hezekiah was told he only has uh
[44:11] to number his days are numbered and he's
[44:13] gonna die but he asked Lord in petition
[44:15] would you would you grant him more years
[44:16] Lord and you granted more years to
[44:18] hezekiah's life will you remember your
[44:20] servant here Marcus Lord would you touch
[44:23] his life
[44:25] months maybe two months Lee we leave
[44:28] that home
[44:30] and not knowing what's happened not
[44:32] knowing what what had taken place and
[44:35] I'm sitting in my house maybe three
[44:36] three months later I think it was and
[44:38] Travis just so happens to be there at my
[44:40] home in my living room and he's talking
[44:42] and we're talking about something some
[44:44] trip and he's he he's in the middle of
[44:46] saying something he pulls out his phone
[44:47] and he has a text message and he just
[44:49] stops
[44:51] and he said
[44:52] Mary just sent me this text in capital
[44:55] letters praise the Living God Marcus has
[44:59] been supernaturally healed of stage four
[45:02] Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma he has no cancer
[45:06] in his body
[45:08] oh you ought to really give the Lord
[45:10] praise for them
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:13] that man went from cancer to no cancer
[45:16] and now you have a pet scan that only
[45:18] shows organs This Is Our God friends
[45:20] this is a supernatural Faith you say
[45:24] what happened brother Matt go ahead and
[45:26] give him praise God and give the Lord
[45:27] praise for that
[45:29] you say what happened somebody believed
[45:32] the promise and that promise was
[45:34] transferred from the words of Jesus into
[45:37] the faith heart that would hold take a
[45:40] hold of it and that promise was
[45:41] transferred to a reality
[45:44] and now Marcus is a healthy man with no
[45:46] cancer in his body
[45:49] now you pray for that man we're
[45:51] witnessing to that man and I told him I
[45:53] pray that the Lord does something
[45:54] greater than the healing of your body
[45:56] but let that only be an insign of what
[45:58] God's wanting to do in your life but
[46:00] even if he doesn't and God never brings
[46:03] him and he's went as far as he can let
[46:05] that testimony be Faith to God's family
[46:08] that we're still serving the god of the
[46:10] impossible
[46:12] as brother Brandon says what ought that
[46:14] to do that ought to give us rapturing
[46:18] faith what ought to give us Rapture and
[46:20] faith that God can heal a man of an
[46:23] impossible condition you say what does
[46:25] that mean brother Matt my condition is
[46:28] impossible I look at myself I look at my
[46:31] body I look at my look at my look at
[46:32] look at yourself today you look at you
[46:34] you look in the mirror you'll see
[46:35] impossibility but God's going to do a
[46:38] miracle
[46:39] and I still believe that God's going to
[46:40] do a miracle I don't care how little it
[46:43] is whatever you need today there's a
[46:45] faith that if you can grab a hold of it
[46:48] and it can become anointed not from your
[46:50] intellects but from your heart that
[46:52] promise Jesus made can come off the page
[46:54] into your heart
[46:57] listen to what brother Brandon says
[46:58] something he says that when the light
[47:01] flashes I love this
[47:03] that when the light flashes from the sky
[47:06] and the trumpet sounds the body of
[47:09] Christ will be quickly gathered together
[47:11] and changed in a moment and taken into
[47:14] the heavens yes I can hear his words
[47:17] there's got to be something like that
[47:23] happened
[47:25] and our schools of theology can never
[47:28] produce that yet they're intellectually
[47:30] all right but you've got to meet that
[47:33] light
[47:34] you've got to find that something
[47:40] here Moses Basin his great call upon the
[47:42] word and was great until one day he met
[47:45] this light and the Very word itself
[47:47] spoke back to him then he got his
[47:50] anointing that anointed what he had in
[47:53] him that on the inside the intellects
[47:55] that believed it the faith that was
[47:57] based upon his belief in God that
[47:59] separated him from his mother and now
[48:01] when he strikes in the presence of this
[48:03] light it anointed
[48:05] what he believed
[48:09] what an anointing brother Branham says
[48:12] then he was commissioned he was
[48:14] commissioned Moses knew this
[48:16] intellectually noted intellectually and
[48:19] the seed that was born in him was laying
[48:21] in his heart listen to this and he tried
[48:24] through his intellectual experience with
[48:27] the word
[48:28] to try to bring them out to deliver them
[48:31] because he knowed he was born for that
[48:33] purpose what did it produce
[48:37] brother random said one dead Egyptian
[48:40] I believe it with all my heart Lord
[48:43] I believe it with all of my heart Lord
[48:45] I've already got it inside of me I've
[48:46] been told that I've been trained it but
[48:48] brother Brandon says until you've met
[48:49] that light and that Faith's been
[48:52] anointed
[48:53] then what will it produce
[48:56] the scriptures all said they had been
[48:58] there 400 years listen to what the
[49:00] prophet of God says here he says I think
[49:02] no church in its practice no matter how
[49:07] intellectual and fundamental it might be
[49:09] that church cannot Thrive until the
[49:14] Supernatural is made known among that
[49:18] people
[49:19] and they see it let me just stop here
[49:22] and say that's supernatural has been
[49:24] made known
[49:25] amongst this people
[49:28] something that they can talk to that
[49:32] will talk back to them
[49:34] that that vindicates this written word
[49:38] now we can preach the wordings this is
[49:40] God's provided way of healing we can
[49:42] preach the word explain the word but you
[49:44] have to receive the word
[49:46] oh Hallelujah that's what sets it a fire
[49:49] brother when you receive it the
[49:51] Revelation something slips out of the
[49:55] Unseen World
[49:57] are you listening to me tonight
[49:59] when you receive the word when you
[50:01] believe the word brother random says
[50:02] what happens something slips out of an
[50:05] Unseen World and comes rolling down
[50:09] through a mystical Channel somewhere
[50:11] into your soul
[50:13] that's a real New Birth
[50:16] brother Brandon says that says now I see
[50:20] it
[50:21] your eyes brighten your lips that hung
[50:24] down straighten up and smile every
[50:26] muscle in your body seems to rejoice
[50:30] Angelic beings Revelations book of
[50:32] symbols Angelic beings associate
[50:34] together oh I hope you get that that
[50:37] just dropped right down free look if
[50:41] you've got the holy spirit in you then
[50:43] you're a candidate for association with
[50:46] the Unseen World and the supernatural
[50:51] you're a candidate when you receive the
[50:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost you're a
[50:57] candidate
[50:58] for Angelic being Association do you
[51:02] know that you associate whether you felt
[51:04] them today whether you heard from them
[51:06] whether you touch them you associated
[51:08] with demon Spirits spirits of Doubt
[51:11] spirits of fear spirits of anxiety
[51:14] spirits of lying that tried to lie to
[51:16] you and talk to you and Whisper to you
[51:18] from the moment you got out of bed oh my
[51:20] brother my sister you're in a war this
[51:23] is a Battleground this is not a picnic
[51:26] every day that a Believer gets out of
[51:28] bed and goes through about trying to
[51:30] fulfill or be pleasing to the Lord
[51:33] there's an enemy that you have there's
[51:35] an enemy that hates you listen to me
[51:37] young people you've got a real enemy who
[51:40] wants to destroy your mind he wants to
[51:42] distort your thoughts he wants to lie to
[51:45] you he wants to change you there's an
[51:47] enemy that you've got you've got to
[51:48] recognize that this is a Battleground
[51:51] it's not a picnic
[51:53] and every day you're in a dimensional
[51:55] world that where's their Spirits in that
[51:57] world I just read this quote and I said
[51:59] Lord I'm ready to shut the door of
[52:02] demonic influences and I'm ready to open
[52:05] the door of angelic Association oh is
[52:09] somebody with me here tonight to say let
[52:11] Angels let me open up myself so that
[52:14] angels can minister to me
[52:18] you're a candidate
[52:22] for association with the Unseen World
[52:27] no wonder listen to this
[52:29] no wonder people can't believe in those
[52:31] things they've never come in contact
[52:33] they've got nothing to believe with but
[52:36] when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[52:38] heart quickly he becomes then a two-fold
[52:42] being
[52:43] one on earth
[52:46] that's me
[52:48] to die that's me and one of Heaven
[52:51] that's me to live
[52:54] Amen in his body he's still subject to
[52:57] death but in his soul he's passed from
[53:00] Death unto life in his body he has his
[53:04] Earthly contact with his five senses in
[53:07] his Spirit he has contact with God
[53:09] through the Holy Ghost and the angels of
[53:12] God visits them and speaks with them and
[53:16] they are messengers sent from God to
[53:18] reveal and to bring messages from God to
[53:22] the individual you know what you ought
[53:24] to do tonight you ought to raise your
[53:25] hand and say Lord I'm inviting an
[53:28] Angelic being to come and influence me
[53:31] I'm gonna shut the door to the lives of
[53:34] the devil and I'm going to ask God would
[53:36] you visit me and speak to me and answer
[53:38] me Lord
[53:39] eggs anoint my faith
[53:43] and he says they bring messages from God
[53:45] to the individual then what
[53:48] we got to be worried about
[53:52] Jesus is here
[53:54] his spirit is here I ask you then what
[53:57] do you got to be worried about
[54:01] brother Brandon says we're in a stops
[54:06] what happened just now
[54:09] I went into another world
[54:12] it's an Unseen World you ought to listen
[54:13] to this on tape
[54:15] he says I went into another world it's
[54:19] an Unseen World we become so conscious
[54:22] of looking at one another like this but
[54:24] there's an Unseen World it's greater
[54:27] than anything you can see
[54:30] so I stopped
[54:32] it begins to say what have we got word
[54:34] about Jesus is here his spirit is here
[54:36] we're in a what happened just now
[54:37] brother random says I left here you
[54:40] still hear me you still see me I'm still
[54:42] here in one sense he says but I've left
[54:45] I've went into another world it's an
[54:48] Unseen World
[54:49] and then he says we become so conscious
[54:51] of looking at one another like this but
[54:54] there's an Unseen World just right here
[54:56] accessible
[54:59] that doesn't mean you're in it that
[55:01] doesn't mean you'll go into it it just
[55:03] means it's available to you
[55:05] that doesn't mean that just because
[55:06] you're part of the something part of
[55:09] something that doesn't mean you ever
[55:11] take part in the something that you're
[55:12] part of
[55:14] right like brother random talks about
[55:15] those that were under Luther's message
[55:17] and he says those that Wonder Wesley's
[55:19] message he says some of them were
[55:21] Sanctified but some of them were in
[55:23] Luther's men were in Wesley's message
[55:25] but live just like the anybody else but
[55:27] there were some of them
[55:29] that took part
[55:31] brother random says there's an Unseen
[55:33] World it's greater than anything you can
[55:35] see and here's Christ
[55:39] in this world in this building hear our
[55:42] evil spirits he's talking about church
[55:45] I got some news for you there's evil

[55:56] aware of it you'd come into church a lot
[55:58] differently you'd sit in the preaching
[56:00] of the word of God a lot differently a
[56:02] lot less distracted a lot less letting
[56:04] your mind slip think about this because
[56:06] why you recognize there's a demon Spirit
[56:09] trying to prevent you from receiving
[56:11] what God has specially prepared for you
[56:15] do you realize when you come into the
[56:17] house of God God has specially anointed
[56:20] a burden upon your pastor and that's a
[56:23] specially prepared message for you
[56:27] but you've got a job to do you've got to
[56:29] leave this realm and you've got to move
[56:30] into that room to receive it
[56:34] brother Madam says in this realm there's
[56:35] Christ and then in this building hear
[56:38] our evil spirits and War I love this
[56:42] quote hear evil spirits and War what is
[56:46] that Warrior what is that war brother
[56:47] Matt there's an angel trying to
[56:49] influence your heart there's an angel
[56:51] trying to say believe Son of God it's
[56:54] inside of you already believe child of
[56:56] God don't doubt the word of God and
[56:59] there's a spirit trying to say it's not
[57:00] for you and that's not for you that
[57:03] preacher's just picking on you he's just
[57:05] up there he's got an ulterior motive but
[57:07] then there's another voice saying it's
[57:09] for you child of God accepted by faith
[57:12] Son of God it's for you it's inside of
[57:15] you the answer you've been looking for
[57:17] is already here right now you just got
[57:21] to reach out and take a hold of it
[57:23] there's war and Christians anointed and
[57:28] the angels of God encamped about them
[57:32] trying to energize them with faith I
[57:37] just stop and say Angels energize my
[57:40] faith
[57:41] if that's the purpose of God then Lord
[57:44] let me be a recipient of that energy you
[57:46] know why because there's everything in
[57:48] this life that tries to sap you of your
[57:52] energy spiritually you got every kind of
[57:55] I don't care I'm not even talking about
[57:56] living in sin or doing anything you
[57:57] shouldn't do I'm just talking about in
[57:59] this world and this age that we live in
[58:01] there is everything that wants to sap
[58:04] your battery dry
[58:06] and a lot of Christians are a lot like
[58:08] iPhones and Android phones and
[58:10] smartphones low battery
[58:13] low battery mode
[58:16] it goes from yellow and you get scared
[58:18] then it goes to red
[58:20] and when it goes to Red you're looking
[58:22] for anything man you're stopping at
[58:24] Walgreens buying a charger stopping at a
[58:26] gas station doesn't matter where you've

[58:30] everything your battery's dying you've
[58:31] got to charge it in order to have a
[58:33] battery you got to plug it into the
[58:35] charger and you know what you can have
[58:37] every charger in your car you can have
[58:39] it in your briefcase you could have it
[58:40] at your desk you could have it in your
[58:42] bedroom but if you don't plug it in it
[58:44] won't do you a bit of good you can have
[58:46] every book you can have every tape you
[58:49] can have every photo of the profit you
[58:50] can have sermons playing but unless you
[58:53] tap into it and plug into it and say I'm
[58:56] going to leave this Dimension and move
[58:58] into an Angelic world where I can
[59:00] receive strength for my family strength
[59:03] for my body healing for my spirit
[59:08] I love that the angels of God are trying
[59:11] to energize them with faith
[59:18] brother Brandon says in this world
[59:19] trying to energize them with faith
[59:23] and so is God here
[59:26] and angels
[59:28] and someday it'll be just as much
[59:32] reality as television or anything else
[59:34] because the spirit will bring us into
[59:37] that Immortal Life
[59:39] then we'll understand
[59:43] notice this here Elijah even here at the
[59:47] Jordan and he asks Elijah I'm going to
[59:49] close
[59:50] he asked Elisha at the Jordan he brings
[59:52] him through these cities of Jericho as
[59:54] we said
[59:56] and it's a it's a it's a rebellious
[59:58] people
[59:59] it brings him to Bethel
[1:00:01] and Elijah says as the Lord liveth and
[1:00:05] as my soul liveth
[1:00:07] I'm not going to leave you
[1:00:10] I'm going to stay right beside you you
[1:00:12] know what this was for Elisha this was a
[1:00:14] test
[1:00:16] this was a test for the ministry of
[1:00:19] Elijah who was the prophet
[1:00:22] for the ministry that was coming because
[1:00:24] Elijah knew there's going to be
[1:00:26] challenges that you face that are
[1:00:29] greater than anything I've faced
[1:00:32] there's going to be challenges that you
[1:00:34] face Elisha there's going to be things
[1:00:37] that you come up against
[1:00:39] and you can't depend upon the mantle
[1:00:42] that I'm wearing
[1:00:43] you can't depend upon the memories you
[1:00:47] can't depend upon the stories but you're
[1:00:49] going to have to receive that same
[1:00:51] anointing there's got to be a transfer
[1:00:54] of that same faith and same expectation
[1:00:57] that was upon Elijah had to be
[1:01:00] transferred to Elisha that same
[1:01:03] expectation that same anointing that
[1:01:07] same Faith listen to what brother
[1:01:09] Branham says here this is some of the
[1:01:11] earliest recorded sermons I have that up
[1:01:13] there I'm going to get to a quote but
[1:01:14] let me go through some of these from
[1:01:16] some of the earliest recorded sermons
[1:01:19] you have of God's prophet
[1:01:21] I know the next thing to happen is the
[1:01:24] restoration of the gifts to the church
[1:01:26] and it's the hardest thing I've had to
[1:01:29] do and he calls it in this pioneering
[1:01:32] work
[1:01:34] what was that pioneering work
[1:01:37] it would listen it's easy to walk down
[1:01:39] the trail it's much easier it's much
[1:01:41] harder to blaze the trail
[1:01:44] and brother Brandon says I've had to
[1:01:46] Pioneer this what brother Branham faith
[1:01:50] expectation
[1:01:52] to bring a people to not just trust in
[1:01:54] the god of history but to believe that
[1:01:56] God is here today
[1:01:57] to believe that he's the same yesterday
[1:01:59] today and forever do you know this is
[1:02:01] what brother Branham contended for from
[1:02:04] the beginning of his ministry to the end
[1:02:06] of his ministry to see that same God of
[1:02:09] the Bible be present tense
[1:02:12] and not just in a prophet but in the
[1:02:13] people
[1:02:14] not just in Aaron's head but all the way
[1:02:17] on the tablet all the way down to his
[1:02:19] Scourge the entire body that there would
[1:02:21] be a tabernacle of people where the
[1:02:23] gifts of God and the spirit of God and
[1:02:26] the power of God listen to me friends it
[1:02:28] was never the intention of of God's
[1:02:31] Prophet to bottle up all of the
[1:02:34] anointing or all of the power in one
[1:02:36] person but it was his desire to see
[1:02:39] Apostolic gifts manifesting in the
[1:02:42] entire body not just five gifts
[1:02:47] not just pre-church not just evangelists
[1:02:49] not just pastors not just apostles
[1:02:52] but in the entire body
[1:02:54] brother random says this was a
[1:02:56] pioneering work
[1:02:58] is to do this and to see people listen
[1:03:00] this is the angel of God in 1948 if all
[1:03:03] the Full Gospel people would come with
[1:03:04] one heart and one Accord there would be
[1:03:06] a Revival that would shake the whole
[1:03:08] world and every spiritual gift would be
[1:03:11] in the church within an hour's time
[1:03:13] after it took place signs and wonders
[1:03:15] that was done by the apostles listen to
[1:03:17] this would be a minor thing
[1:03:19] to what would do if we could just get
[1:03:21] the church together it's got to happen
[1:03:26] it will happen
[1:03:29] it may be after I've passed off the
[1:03:31] scene but I want to put my word in this
[1:03:35] that you might know that my voice may go
[1:03:39] away I may leave this earth but there
[1:03:42] will be a magnetic tape that you listen
[1:03:44] to through digitally or through however
[1:03:46] you listen to the the tape of God's
[1:03:48] Prophet let my voice ring out and speak
[1:03:51] this
[1:03:53] and he says it will happen it's got to
[1:03:55] happen it may be after I've passed off
[1:03:57] the scene but I want to put my word in
[1:03:59] this that you might know that my voice
[1:04:02] is this
[1:04:05] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:04:07] and forever 1953 it is to my humble
[1:04:09] belief that we're living near the end
[1:04:11] time or may I make it a little more
[1:04:13] personal than that Satan we're living in
[1:04:16] the end time
[1:04:17] I believe it's time for the restoration
[1:04:19] of the church that was promised that God
[1:04:21] would send in the day in this last day I
[1:04:24] believe that this is the day of when the
[1:04:26] word has been preached so much that the
[1:04:28] day is getting so dark and so evil till
[1:04:30] according to God's word he was to
[1:04:32] restore all that the caterpillar had
[1:04:34] eaten the Palmer worm had eaten will be
[1:04:37] restored back again and this is the day
[1:04:39] of the restoration of the spiritual
[1:04:42] gifts given into the church it wasn't so
[1:04:45] from the beginning and when the church
[1:04:47] puts forth another church it'll be a
[1:04:49] Pentecostal church with signs of the
[1:04:52] acts and the Apostles doing the same
[1:04:55] thing with the same Jesus working the
[1:04:58] same did you hear that the same Jesus
[1:05:01] not a different Jesus the Same power
[1:05:03] because he's the same yesterday and
[1:05:07] forever
[1:05:08] a Pentecostal Branch filled with the
[1:05:11] Holy Ghost signs and wonders of the
[1:05:13] Resurrection great things taking place
[1:05:16] among them they who know their God in
[1:05:19] the last days shall do exploits we're
[1:05:23] yes we're at the end time what are you
[1:05:25] saying brother Matt I'm saying this
[1:05:28] should be our expectation
[1:05:31] and say what our expectation brother
[1:05:33] Matt to see God manifest himself
[1:05:37] more than just intellectually more than
[1:05:39] just a word more than just what I think
[1:05:40] or what I've been told or what I say but
[1:05:43] let that Spirit manifest itself let that
[1:05:46] promise be transferred from the Bible to
[1:05:49] me personally
[1:05:50] amen yes we're at the end time
[1:05:53] some of the last recorded sermons here's
[1:05:55] God does God change his mind what a
[1:05:57] title
[1:05:58] 1965 does God
[1:06:00] change his mind
[1:06:03] now we find out that in the time that
[1:06:05] we're in this great thing has been
[1:06:06] brought up we find out that we're
[1:06:07] missing something in our churches hold
[1:06:10] on brother Branham the seals have been
[1:06:13] preached 1965.
[1:06:15] we're missing something in our churches
[1:06:17] and that is the power of Christ
[1:06:20] now notice he didn't say Sensations he
[1:06:22] didn't say emotions
[1:06:24] wasn't just about just a super just one
[1:06:27] Sensational experience this isn't what
[1:06:28] Elisha was after
[1:06:30] Elisha wasn't going to settle for
[1:06:32] anything less than the mantle or the
[1:06:34] spirit that was on Elijah to come upon
[1:06:36] Elisha
[1:06:38] something in our churches and that is
[1:06:40] the power of Christ now look I don't
[1:06:42] want to criticize I love you and genuine
[1:06:44] true love always is corrective now we're
[1:06:46] missing Christ in our church
[1:06:49] I read this and I'll never forget when I
[1:06:52] read this quote right here and I
[1:06:55] immediately my mind left my church but
[1:06:58] left any church
[1:06:59] and it went straight to my family
[1:07:02] and straight to my home
[1:07:04] and straight to this home
[1:07:07] and brother Branham says now we're
[1:07:09] missing something
[1:07:10] or missing Christ
[1:07:12] amongst our Pentecostal people and I
[1:07:15] stopped and said Lord don't let this be
[1:07:17] true of me
[1:07:20] how many would identify themselves and
[1:07:22] say Lord
[1:07:23] don't let this be true of me
[1:07:28] don't let me Miss Christ
[1:07:33] get the religion get the doctrine but
[1:07:36] then miss Christ
[1:07:39] we're missing Christ amongst our
[1:07:40] Pentecost we have our brothers and
[1:07:42] sisters there's something
[1:07:44] wrong
[1:07:46] the old-fashioned prayer meetings
[1:07:49] oh he only talked about that brother
[1:07:51] Matt before 1963. I love how brother
[1:07:53] Aaron Brother Aaron your pastor says
[1:07:56] when what year did Brother Branham say
[1:07:58] this the year he was a prophet
[1:08:02] and for those that dates mean something
[1:08:03] here's 1965. the old-fashioned prayer
[1:08:07] meetings they used to have all day and
[1:08:08] night they don't want to have them no
[1:08:10] more are women used to wear long hair
[1:08:12] they don't do it anymore be a disgrace
[1:08:13] for women to paint and use paint back in
[1:08:15] the early days and act that way these
[1:08:17] women knew something went wrong
[1:08:19] nothing's wrong with Christ
[1:08:22] but something went wrong something is
[1:08:25] somewhere the pulpit used to wouldn't
[1:08:26] have permitted such a thing as that but
[1:08:28] it does now see the crisis is on and
[1:08:31] we're missing something I I scoured
[1:08:33] these going through just over the last
[1:08:36] month and a half of some of the last
[1:08:38] things this is what was on brother
[1:08:40] Brandon's heart what was in his Spirit
[1:08:42] what was upon Elijah before he leaves
[1:08:45] the scene what are some of the burdens
[1:08:47] what are some of the things that he's
[1:08:49] saying what is he wanting to say what is
[1:08:51] he wanting to express and he's saying
[1:08:53] this in 1965 areas in April
[1:08:55] see the crisis is on
[1:08:58] we're missing power that we ought to
[1:09:00] have
[1:09:01] or the big machine ought to be running
[1:09:03] up and great signs and wonders well this
[1:09:05] building ought to be sitting so full of
[1:09:09] the power of God now till a sinner
[1:09:11] couldn't stay in here
[1:09:13] the Holy Spirit condemning it right
[1:09:15] quickly like that like ananias and
[1:09:18] savira if a sinner couldn't stay in this
[1:09:20] building then a Christian definitely
[1:09:23] ought not to be able to stay under
[1:09:24] preaching with sin in their life
[1:09:26] the it should expose us
[1:09:29] brother Adam says The Sinner shouldn't
[1:09:31] be able to stay here until the sinner
[1:09:33] can say the Holy Spirit condemning it
[1:09:34] right quickly like the end of us in
[1:09:35] summer Sapphira and we're missing
[1:09:37] something
[1:09:38] the God of this evil age
[1:09:40] August
[1:09:41] now she's calls the whole world to
[1:09:43] accept the scientific leadership
[1:09:46] of the educational program that Satan
[1:09:48] has given to her under the name of a
[1:09:50] church the leadership of an educational
[1:09:52] scientific program I'm picturing to you
[1:09:54] the God of this world when she as Eve
[1:09:57] had the very filling of God's word in
[1:09:58] her hand she could have took God's word
[1:10:00] but what did she do to that instead of
[1:10:02] tearing for the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost let science prove to her that the
[1:10:07] Holy Ghost was only for the disciples
[1:10:10] instead of keeping Divine Healing going
[1:10:12] when she ought to now be raising the
[1:10:14] dead and doing great Miracles she has
[1:10:17] let Satan under his leadership of
[1:10:19] religious man take the word of God and
[1:10:22] try to say that it was for another age
[1:10:25] and she's believed it
[1:10:28] when the Bible said the the things that
[1:10:31] I do
[1:10:32] shall you do also Jesus said that go you
[1:10:36] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:10:39] to Every Creature I love this we're
[1:10:42] still creatures
[1:10:45] go into all the world and preach the
[1:10:47] gospel we're still creatures these signs
[1:10:50] shall follow every them not just brother
[1:10:51] cop brother random says not just brother
[1:10:54] Roberts not just brother here not just
[1:10:55] brother Branham or brother Brandon
[1:10:57] quotes the scripture Mark 16 these signs
[1:11:00] shall follow all them that believe
[1:11:04] she denies every bit of it so what was
[1:11:07] closing to brother Branham
[1:11:09] what was his challenge
[1:11:12] to see a living God
[1:11:15] to see a promise of God
[1:11:17] come off of the Bible
[1:11:19] because within that anointing was the
[1:11:22] purpose
[1:11:23] and within that promise was the purpose
[1:11:26] what was Elisha asking for let the
[1:11:29] purpose not of Elijah because that
[1:11:31] Ministry would be used in Elijah then
[1:11:33] Elisha then John the Baptist and all all
[1:11:35] the way up down to God's Prophet but it
[1:11:37] was the purpose that God had let me
[1:11:40] receive a double portion brother Brandon
[1:11:43] says here notice this here and the God
[1:11:45] that he keeps going that she denied she
[1:11:47] denies all the Supernatural and she
[1:11:48] swapped it for his intellectual
[1:11:50] conception of the Bible where priest and
[1:11:52] Holy Father so-called were Bishops
[1:11:53] archbishops District presidents General
[1:11:55] overseers so forth has put their own
[1:11:57] interpretation to it as God has left
[1:11:59] them set there dead is 12 o'clock and I
[1:12:03] believe here's things that are to be now
[1:12:04] we move to December 5th I believe that
[1:12:07] the same thing we live in today God
[1:12:09] bearing record of his word by
[1:12:12] vindicating what he said he would do now
[1:12:15] we know that this is the day of
[1:12:17] salvation thank God the day of salvation
[1:12:19] is still here
[1:12:20] where God is calling men from the world
[1:12:23] from a life of sin into a life of
[1:12:24] service and in the day God has poured
[1:12:27] out a spirit from on high great signs
[1:12:29] and wonders are to accompany the
[1:12:32] ministry of this day this is when the
[1:12:34] farmer and latter rain are falling
[1:12:37] together
[1:12:38] and we know that they're supposed to be
[1:12:41] great signs and wonders
[1:12:43] which is in many great denominations
[1:12:45] this is turned down
[1:12:48] but I'm very thankful
[1:12:53] to these open doors
[1:12:55] that I've had to go into
[1:12:57] and the inspiration
[1:13:00] it's give to young men like your pastor
[1:13:03] here
[1:13:05] so what was brother Brandon saying
[1:13:07] notice the doors have shut
[1:13:10] they've they've they the Charismatic
[1:13:13] Church the Pentecostal Church
[1:13:15] has shut the doors
[1:13:17] brother random says where it's turned
[1:13:19] down they deny every bit of it but then
[1:13:21] he says but I'm very thankful for these
[1:13:24] doors open doors that I had to go into
[1:13:27] and the inspiration it's given to young
[1:13:30] men like your pastor here in other words
[1:13:32] he's called something
[1:13:36] that's caused them as I'm beginning to
[1:13:39] get old and know that my days are
[1:13:40] numbered and know that these young men
[1:13:42] can take this message and sweep it on to
[1:13:46] the coming of the Lord
[1:13:48] if he doesn't come in my generation
[1:13:49] which I'm hoping to see him and I look
[1:13:52] daily for him
[1:13:54] remember these are the last words
[1:13:56] I'll look daily
[1:13:58] for him
[1:13:59] this is what is on his heart
[1:14:03] like daily for him watch
[1:14:05] keeping myself prepared
[1:14:08] for that hour
[1:14:13] notice this to his last recorded sermon
[1:14:15] you know the hour will soon arise when
[1:14:17] right Among Us will be the holy spirit
[1:14:19] will speak out like it did in the united
[1:14:20] sense if I were remember see the hour is
[1:14:24] arriving and we are now you just
[1:14:27] remember that that God is going to dwell
[1:14:31] among his people that's what he wants to
[1:14:35] do
[1:14:36] now
[1:14:39] I read this in in Tucson to the Tucson
[1:14:41] Tabernacles very special I want to read
[1:14:43] it to you here tonight
[1:14:45] and this was the desire brother Adam had
[1:14:49] it it is it is it is incredible
[1:14:53] when you watch this by dates
[1:14:56] of when brother Bynum comes to Tucson
[1:14:59] and he says I sat here I didn't want to
[1:15:01] start a church I didn't want to have a
[1:15:02] church here I didn't want to I didn't
[1:15:04] want to I didn't want to have any
[1:15:05] conflict with the Assemblies of God you
[1:15:07] Brothers you Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness
[1:15:09] and he says but I sat here in the desert
[1:15:11] for three years and you never invited me
[1:15:12] your pulpit you never invited me to your
[1:15:15] church
[1:15:16] you never invited me to come speak so
[1:15:18] brother Brandon brother green opens
[1:15:20] leaves Beaumont Texas opens starts uh
[1:15:23] starts the Tucson Tabernacle in Tucson
[1:15:25] Arizona left everything forsook
[1:15:28] everything
[1:15:29] my grandpa was with him in Beaumont when
[1:15:31] he left everything had my grandpa went
[1:15:33] to Tucson I'd be living in Arizona right
[1:15:34] now but God had other plans
[1:15:36] notice he says in what house will you
[1:15:38] build me he says but we as this group of
[1:15:41] people we have a message for this day we
[1:15:44] believe that God has given us a message
[1:15:45] and brother green is I don't want to
[1:15:47] call him my associate because well it
[1:15:49] also is my associate we're together in
[1:15:51] this message
[1:15:52] brother green preaches the same thing
[1:15:55] and message that I believe in he's left
[1:15:57] his home he left his people he left his
[1:15:59] church he was I believe he was a
[1:16:02] district superintendent of something
[1:16:03] listen friends I I just want to inject
[1:16:05] this right here they they left something
[1:16:08] to come to something they forsook
[1:16:11] something the first generation of people
[1:16:14] my grandparents left everything to
[1:16:17] follow the message
[1:16:19] and let me just say it doesn't matter if
[1:16:21] you were born and raised in this message
[1:16:22] you've got to leave everything and until
[1:16:25] you're willing to forsake everything and
[1:16:27] leave everything that you thought
[1:16:30] President says he left everything he
[1:16:32] left his home he left his church he was
[1:16:34] a deuce district superintendent one of
[1:16:36] the organization give the whole thing up
[1:16:37] when he heard this
[1:16:39] he left everything that was dear to him
[1:16:40] also to come to the desert just to
[1:16:43] support
[1:16:44] what God is giving to us now
[1:16:48] I say I believe it not only should be in
[1:16:50] our hearts it should be our duty to back
[1:16:53] him up
[1:16:54] everything that we can to attend the
[1:16:57] services to come here to worship to make
[1:17:01] this a place you've got to make it that
[1:17:04] place listen it doesn't happen just by a
[1:17:06] personality of a man you've got to make
[1:17:09] it that place you can have the most
[1:17:12] powerful Gifted Man the most charismatic
[1:17:14] ma'am with a wonderful Ministry but
[1:17:16] until a church says transfer that
[1:17:18] promise transfer it to the whole body to
[1:17:21] the young to the five-year-olds
[1:17:23] eight-year-olds 20 year olds to the
[1:17:26] whole church comes into Unity to make
[1:17:28] this a place
[1:17:30] where God can come and dwell
[1:17:33] and he says to make this a place
[1:17:36] where God can reveal to us the things he
[1:17:39] has for us to reveal and his word said
[1:17:40] the message brother Brandon quotes
[1:17:42] brother green who comes before brother
[1:17:44] random takes the pulpit this is what
[1:17:46] brother green says the message doesn't
[1:17:48] come to me through the given of
[1:17:49] inspiration as it does to maybe some of
[1:17:51] us but he said I am here to back up what
[1:17:53] God has given let me just put my voice
[1:17:55] and say I am here to back up the saith
[1:17:59] the Lord
[1:18:01] I have no other agenda I have no other
[1:18:03] purpose I have no other Mission other
[1:18:05] than to back up what God has done and
[1:18:10] what God is doing
[1:18:13] he's here to back up brother Brandon
[1:18:15] says what a statement and I believe if
[1:18:18] so we'll all cooperate together we'll
[1:18:19] put our hearts to it I know that each of
[1:18:21] you if you feel like I do aha
[1:18:25] we can get a barometer on brother
[1:18:28] Branham
[1:18:29] what was brother Brandon feeling in
[1:18:31] November 21st
[1:18:33] 1965. where was his heart
[1:18:36] brother random says and I know that each
[1:18:38] of you if you feel like I do I am so
[1:18:42] hungry
[1:18:44] to see the spirit of God moving
[1:18:48] I just can't hardly stand it
[1:18:52] I wonder if that would resonate with
[1:18:54] somebody here tonight
[1:18:56] and you could say I'm so hungry Lord
[1:19:00] I just can't hardly stand it some
[1:19:04] experience I've just had up in the
[1:19:05] mountain just to fill that once again
[1:19:08] that's something that when I was first
[1:19:10] Saved was So Glorious to my heart we
[1:19:12] could come into a place
[1:19:13] we can sit and we could see it among us
[1:19:15] that we're drying
[1:19:18] we sit here in the desert listen to this
[1:19:20] I get among my brother and they talked
[1:19:22] with me I talked with them always in a
[1:19:23] little way of watching Phil and other
[1:19:24] what the feeling uh out there with the
[1:19:26] spirit as it was to see just the
[1:19:28] condition of that brother to see what's
[1:19:29] wrong I begin to fill us all reclining
[1:19:34] getting away from the spirit listen this
[1:19:37] isn't a spirit that just affects Arizona
[1:19:40] this isn't a spirit that just affects
[1:19:42] Europe it's a spirit that's permeating
[1:19:44] laodicea it permeates that Spirit of
[1:19:48] reclining is attacking you your children
[1:19:50] your home your church
[1:19:53] you got to stand against it
[1:19:56] how many is with me
[1:19:57] say I'm going to stand against it I'm
[1:19:59] not going to recline I'm not going to
[1:20:01] dry Satan you might have thrown
[1:20:03] everything to put my fire out but here I
[1:20:05] am Satan I'm still standing I'm still
[1:20:08] believing I'm still pressing I'm still
[1:20:10] pulling I'm still supporting I'm still
[1:20:13] creating an atmosphere for the Holy
[1:20:15] Spirit and no matter what I go through
[1:20:17] or what tomorrow holds I'll be here
[1:20:19] tomorrow I'll still be supporting the
[1:20:21] ministry I'll still be attending the
[1:20:23] services oh can somebody join me here
[1:20:25] tonight
[1:20:26] I'll still be here trying to create an
[1:20:29] atmosphere for the Lord Jesus
[1:20:32] and he says oh here he says I see it
[1:20:35] just the condition he says I begin to
[1:20:37] refill this all reclining this has
[1:20:39] become too natural a thing we must
[1:20:41] Worship in the spirit
[1:20:43] where the spirit of God not only our
[1:20:45] message should be the flame of the hour
[1:20:47] it should be the flame in our hearts
[1:20:51] it's got to be in our hearts
[1:20:55] and now that brother green God sent him
[1:20:56] in here and opened up a church like a
[1:20:58] precious face that we believe in you
[1:20:59] know our brother brother green said he
[1:21:00] opened the church his own words he said
[1:21:02] I wanted a church that I could mention
[1:21:03] the name William Branham and not have to
[1:21:06] explain it
[1:21:07] and it not offend anybody
[1:21:11] brother green brother Brandon says and
[1:21:12] now that brother green has sent him in
[1:21:13] here and opened us up a church of like
[1:21:15] Precious faith that we believe in we
[1:21:17] ought to be very grateful to God and
[1:21:19] attend every service
[1:21:23] take every place that we can
[1:21:29] don't just don't just come
[1:21:32] don't just enjoy
[1:21:34] but say Lord where can I fill in
[1:21:37] let me take every place that I can
[1:21:40] if we're asked to call on to pray to
[1:21:41] seek to do let's be soldiers just
[1:21:43] anxious to do it
[1:21:45] keep the message honorable
[1:21:49] live the right kind of life
[1:21:52] don't let no smut come upon it we're
[1:21:54] living too late now I just raised my
[1:21:57] hand and invite you with me to say Lord
[1:21:59] let me keep the message honorable
[1:22:03] let me live the right kind of life don't
[1:22:06] let me let nothing come upon it Lord
[1:22:09] we're living too late let's live it
[1:22:11] clean will my life your life all of our
[1:22:14] Lives need to be picked up before God
[1:22:17] our young people just ride around from
[1:22:19] place to place from show to show
[1:22:21] drifting further and further away from
[1:22:22] God now that's the truth I see it in my
[1:22:26] children
[1:22:27] I see myself get into a place where
[1:22:30] you've got to assemble ourselves
[1:22:33] together to worship God
[1:22:36] the Bible said so when we see this day
[1:22:39] approaching that much more come together
[1:22:43] there's something about coming together
[1:22:48] if there's only two people here you be
[1:22:51] one of them
[1:22:53] and if we come together and worship
[1:22:56] together then we just something another
[1:22:59] about it Jesus said where two or three
[1:23:02] are gathered in my name there I am in
[1:23:07] their midst
[1:23:09] is that your desire
[1:23:11] I disclose musicians can return
[1:23:14] can come if you could come
[1:23:16] stand to your feet stand with me
