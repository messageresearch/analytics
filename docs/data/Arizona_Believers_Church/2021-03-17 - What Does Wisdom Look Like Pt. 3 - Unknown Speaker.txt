TRANSCRIPT
========================================
take every heart that's here that's willingly offered to you upon that potter's will and molded as you would see fit lord to those that would tune in and stream the service lord i do not believe they do it because they're going to criticize or because they're trying to find fault they're doing it because they're hungry they're doing it because they want to hear from you and they're seeking something they're searching something so lord i pray you would speak to their hearts just as we've gathered to receive from you may those that would stream and are even follow up in the archive lord may they receive something special from you for lord criticism and pride has not drawn them to stream lord it's a hunger even unbeknownst to them that draws them to do it lord speak to them i pray lord bless us tonight as we've gathered in your presence in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen i'm going to be reading from colossians chapter 4 so if you'd like to grab your bibles while you're standing i'd like to read from colossians chapter 4 and read the first six verses there compliments to brother michael and for the loyal brother micah with the song service just doing a tremendous job and i enjoy their gifts so much and i'm so grateful that god has seen fit to place them amongst us so may god richly bless them and i mean that brothers you're doing a tremendous job and thank you so much i'm sure you're enjoying it too and you can always take the liberty to express it if it's sincere if it's fake you know maybe maybe hold off but it's sincere i'm sure none of these gifts that are present amongst us and those who sing specials and labor in different ways they love love to hear that communication back to them colossians chapter 4 verses 1 to 6. i hope when i come to this later i want to be able to point this out again but if you look in chapter 3 it's very much akin to ephesians chapter five where paul is instructing husbands wives parents children so it's directed following his direction to family there in chapter three so he says masters given to your servants that which is just an equal knowing that you also have a master which is teacher ahead in heaven and then that kind of summarizes his uh speaking to these different offices and these different relationships then this is to all of us collectively continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving with all praying also for us that god would speak open unto us excuse me that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ which i am also in bonds we're praying that liberty would be granted to him to speak this mystery that's what he's praying to those at colossia and he says that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak so it's the manifestation of the mystery speaking these great and profound things of christ and then as that would be our prayer this is what he desires for us individually walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how you ought to answer every man walk in wisdom toward them that are outside the body of christ outside the faith redeeming the time let your speech be always always have your speech seasoned with grace seasoned with salt let it be with grace in a graceful way seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer to every man this is a response this is something being given to man wonderful reading you can have your seats this evening and with that as a a context i'd like just to jump right in uh to our subject tonight we're continuing on the question what does wisdom look like we're focusing specifically on meekness that wisdom is meek and it's an essential attribute and characteristic of wisdom and i think one way just to summarize where we've been through the first couple services on this subject matter is that wisdom is the word and humility it is the meekness of christ who is the treasure of all wisdom and the treasure of all knowledge and understanding and i'm wanting to expound upon james chapter 3 so you could also turn there and you'll find several verses that we'd like to read beginning in verse and ask this question who is the wise man and a dude with knowledge among you who's this teacher who's the master the teacher amongst you he is going to be supposed to be wise and have knowledge empowered with knowledge he says if there's going to be one who assumes the role of leader or teacher let him show out of a good conversation out of a life lived his work so he must have works that follows his assumption or profession that he's in this position of leadership or this position of being a teacher and all of us we are supposed to grow in grace and to a place where we ourselves are also teachers and we're communicating the faith effectively so we bring ourselves under this same admonishment let him show out of a life a manner of life a good conduct a good conversation his works with this phrase to me is what we're amplifying meekness of wisdom because true wisdom is always accompanied with meekness meekness as it would uh relate to the government of passions and controlling your emotions that wisdom is for is going to exhibit itself in a meekness meekness is something as we looked at these other verses as we'll read through them and you could read in 14 and 15 and 16 how it's referring to this how that meekness or wisdom is not loud wisdom is not arrogant wisdom does not need to be accepted or submitted to because it has a higher volume than anything else does not need to be accepted because it seems to be more more forceful or it's branded better you accept wisdom because it's true you accept wisdom because it has a a meekness to it that makes it acceptable and even pleasing so true wisdom is not loud or arrogant and so as we could read some of these other verses and we're kind of just catching up on a couple things that we administered on last time wisdom does luck does not look noisy it is not intimidating and so wisdom then as it relates to the scriptures that james or the scriptures in james it's not self-justifying it's not selfish wisdom does not advise for its own benefit but it does for your benefit it advises it instructs and encourages for your own benefit and in the context that james is referring to wisdom and uh setting it as opposed to wisdom which is from beneath wisdom that is from above is not caustic it does not um bring up a stir up strife or arouse conflict and there's a way that you can give somebody your opinion and you think you're imparting wisdom but you share your opinion and what does it do it kind of provokes a fight why because it didn't the way that it was shared aroused more conflict than it did consideration and thought and and a pondering of it so wisdom which is from below is characterized by jealousy and selfishness which the scripture says in james chapter 3 results in chaos or disorder that's the wisdom which is from beneath it is it is characterized as being jealous and being strifeful or selfish and it results in conflict and and you just you confront something and you're giving you're wanting to help but you confront it you wade into it too forcefully you you're not using wisdom so it stirs things up and it convolutes and it causes disorder or chaos and so this wisdom which is from beneath results in this disputing and fighting and kind of the target that i've been chasing and these things that i've been expressing is how that wisdom brings a rest and i wanted to share more on this rest how what does wisdom look like it looks as if it's at rest it's something that's restful but we're just failed to impress upon more in this sense of meekness but this disputing and fighting and criticism it marks one that isn't as rest at rest so when someone has true wisdom they can rest in the truth of their wisdom when wisdom is on their side and the truth is on their side they don't have to resort to different tactics to produce a particular result they're like this is true if you follow truth it yields something it brings forth something and you rest in that and so if there's fighting and criticism even fear or intimidation and force that there's a mark of somebody who's not at rest because it's not the meekness of christ it's not the meekness that was associated with christ and we were reading the statement how that brother bannon says that christ overcame how did he overcome in his personal life how did he overcome personal temptation all by the word and humility we can say all day long we've got the word we got the word we got the correct interpretation of the bible the correct translation we've got the perfect word uh made perfectly clear the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication and you can have all that word on your side by profession but if you don't have humility it's never going to be effective so we overcome in your own personal life if you're going to overcome as a christian it takes the word and humility and brother brahm says oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example so we make christ our example and our example of successful life our example of overcoming is the word and humility he has laid for us an example he has set for us an example that we are to follow and it's not just merely asking ourselves what would jesus do but it's knowing the word understanding the word and humbling ourselves to it that is how he overcame that is how we overcome and we ended last wednesday night in looking at the example of david and how david we could even point out that god characterized him as being a man after his own heart so there was something about david despite all of his flaws that in the end he got it right in the end there was something about his ability to say i'm sorry and to repent despite all his mistakes and all his sins he could ultimately get it right and if you just compare david's faults to saul's saul just sacrificed when it wasn't convenient saul and paul you know entered in onto the the role of a prophet and he had the kingdom taken away from him david committed adultery and committed murder and yet his consequences he couldn't build the temple yet the kingdom remained with him and it's amazing when you begin to think about the sins of david versus the sins of saul and you find it was the condition of the heart that ultimately condemned saul and kept them from ever walking in a path that was pleasing to god but david despite his mistakes and despite his pride and despite his arrogance he finally overthrew his pride which was represented in those sons of surya he overthrew his pride and his selfish ambition and he found the meekness of wisdom he found it in the face of one who was criticizing him spitting in his face and and ranting against him and mocking him because of his own family turning against him he said you know what perhaps god has caused him to do this and if i handle this well god will bring me a blessing in it he found the meekness of wisdom so we make christ our example this is what wisdom looks like it looks meek in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 he says now i paul myself beseech you so this is a pleading a teaching an admonishment that paul is doing he said i'm beseech you i'm pleading with you by the meekness and gentleness of christ we could even say that these are characteristics of the word the word is all-powerful nothing has ever over overwhelmed it nothing can overthrow it but yet in all its power there's a meekness and gentleness with it so he's not coming with the power of christ and and the magnitude of christ he's using the words i want to beseech you plead with you implore you by the meekness and gentleness of christ and this is the meekness and gentleness of the word so he is painting a picture of grace and patience as the hallmarks of correction and instruction when he's beseeching someone and he's wanting i want you to get this and i'm wanting you here to the corinthians in this letter he's writing them which is going to carry some very in your face bold correction he said i'm imploring i'm beseeching you by the meekness and gentleness of christ because these the meekness and gentleness of christ are the hallmarks of proper correction and proper instruction hold those two words in your heart and in your mind today as we go forward in this that he is looking at grace and patience this meekness and gentleness as the the characteristics of effective discipline if it's going to be a fact of correction or effective effective instruction is going to have to this have this meekness and gentleness and so this becomes as christ is our example christ having this meekness and gentleness he's our example of leadership not only is he our example of leadership he's our example of submission if we're if we're wanting if we're wanting to be like christ we cannot look at it as the act of us we can't look at it as king of the hill right i'm not referring to a sitcom i think there's a sitcom called king of the hill or something like that i don't know never seen an episode but it's we're talking about when you have a mound of anything and all the boys do what king of the hill king of the mountain and you try to throw the person off so we're not looking at a situation we're trying to send to the highest point we're rising to the highest point we're pushing another person off that's not what it means uh to come to come to this place of to leadership in a place of headship but we can only do it by getting as small as we possibly can the way up is down so it's not only our example of leadership but this example of leadership is found in submission the way that christ lived the way that he act is uh the model behavior for us it's behavior that we should model in learning and in teaching though in those two senses in our learning as we learn but also as we teach as we instruct he's the example of the behavior the character the attributes that we should model that we should emulate be therefore dear followers be therefore followers of god as dear children so this is an example that we model after that we want to be exemplified in our own lives it says in hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 i'm just going to use a couple scriptures to identify how that christ is an example of learning christ is an example of submission though he were his son yet learned he obedience and says obedience by the things which he suffered but let's just focus on this one part he learned christ was a son and as a son he learned this is important for us to take in and let it wash over us christ the son of god learned he learned then you are going to have to learn if he learned you learn he learned obedience we've got to learn obedience there's things that are instructed to us while i'm predestinated i'm elected i'm a son of god i've been born again i'm filled with the holy ghost that's wonderful that means you're in the condition to learn you're in a position to receive instruction you're a position to grow so he learned this is the example this is the meekness and gentleness of christ first that we identify with he learned in luke chapter 2 verses 51 to 52 as the story is told that they were up in jerusalem and he was left behind by joseph and mary he was found in the temple teaching and and exchanging thoughts with the with the priest and they find him and where were you my your father and i have sought you and he goes i must be about my father's business it says in verse 51 and he went down with him with joseph and mary he went down with him and came to nazareth and was subject unto them he had full understanding that his he was called to do his father's business not not a carpenter in joseph's shop his uh who would be recognized as his earthly dad he was fully cognizant of this relationship he had with his heavenly father and he espoused this is what i must be faithful to i must be about my father's business but it did not keep him from subjecting himself to his earthly parents the ones that god had entrusted him to so he says he was subject unto them but his mother kept all these saints in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom though he were son he learned so here we see once again that jesus subject to his parents increased his wisdom this is the model behavior there's anyone here 12 today and you want to get something out of service this is what you can get out of service make yourself subject to your parents this is how you increase in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man so we cannot the increase of his wisdom the increase of his understanding and his knowledge is it related to this life of jesus christ we cannot separate it from the fact that he made himself subject to joseph and mary made himself subject to them and the bible says he increased in wisdom and as he increased in wisdom he also increased in favor with god how could he increase in favor with god as it unfolded in his life through submission as he was taught as he learned obedience he increased in favor with god and man so these attributes of christ this meekness and gentleness of christ this attribute of one that learns one that becomes subject one that increases in wisdom cannot be separated from the attributes that we give him as teacher we look at christ as being the master of all circumstance we look at him as the treasure of all wisdom and knowledge he is the master he is the head they called him rabbi teacher you are the master you are the teacher we cannot separate these attributes of being meek and being gentle being able to learn being able to submit himself and being able to increase in wisdom we cannot take that away from the picture of him as a teacher he is the he is considered the good shepherd he is considered the great shepherd so he's the leader he is the one that looks out over the flock he's the one that feeds he's the one that cares for he's the one that provides all these attributes that we look to him and ascribe to him as the powerful one the preeminent one the leader the head the shepherd these other attributes have to be part of the picture to fully understand his nature and character as the head again the head is not just the king of the hill the person who gets up there and overthrows everyone else there's a way to get to the top and the way up is down through submission through teaching through learning and so he was effective and this is this is something that is very very dear to my heart as god is ex is in a very supernatural profound way and press this upon me and i've wanted to preach a whole sermon on it and i just find that i've got to give outlet to it and say this about christ he was effective and he is effective he was effective and is effective as a shepherd because he's always a sheep we call christ the great shepherd he's called the good shepherd there this is how the lord you were raised in the good shepherd fellowship right i remember preaching there many years ago in minnesota and who's that a reference to it's not whoever's name is on the mark he is pastor it's christ this isn't a reference to a man this is jesus christ he is the good shepherd he is the master he's the teacher he's the great shepherd and and what makes him a great shepherd the bible does not characterize him alone as the great shepherd he's characterized as the lamb he's first the lamb before he's the lion what makes him a great shepherd the fact that he's sheep he's always sheep he's always a lamb there's always even a representation of that bleedy that bleeding lamb in heaven and it represents this nature of christ how he is a good shepherd he is the great shepherd but he's effective as the shepherd because he's still and is always a sheep and the most powerful tool that we have as parents the most powerful tool as we have as teachers the most powerful tool we have in leadership is the tool of example it's the most powerful tool in your arsenal as a parent trying to figure out how to do something with your child you're trying to figure out how you're going to make a difference you're trying to figure out how you can change things with your home the most powerful thing you could do is provide model behavior it's the most impactful significant thing you can do the best way to achieve a particular result within your family within your life in somebody else is you're trying to teach somebody else and help somebody else don't just tell them to get up at five o'clock every morning and do something go ahead and get up at five o'clock in the morning yourself and invite them to do it with you and you'll find that the one you're trying to teach to do it will find it would be more easily led and and effective in doing it not that there's anything special about getting up at five o'clock in the morning that just what popped in my mouth at the time so nobody try to get a hold of me at five o'clock in the morning unless you absolutely need to because i'm not making that a habit right now but it's that you want to provide behavior and i find this uh i want to express this in a way that it can be relevant to all of us one of the biggest blind spots for pastors is they forget that they're sheep not that they were sheep but they are sheep and it becomes a blind spot in leadership becomes a blind spot in parents it becomes a blind spot to forget that you were a child at one point what it's like to be a child what it's like to receive instruction and hear instruction and not understand it we forget what it's like so one of the biggest blind spots we can have a leadership one of the biggest blind spots that a pastor could have is they forget that they are sheep and they forget that they ever were a sheep in some cases they never worship they've never been exercised and they don't know what it's like to be to be a member of a congregation they forgot what it's like to be the one sitting in the pew they've lost the feeling for what it's like to be a sheep they've lost the feeling to know what it's like when your job schedule changes and you're not able to make it to church on wednesday night they they forgot what it's like to have these different things taking place and to be in a totally different position listen there's something about being the man of god who who has the responsibility of speaking every service if you don't realize that god speaks to you for the people's benefit and you let that get to your head you lose the feeling of the people he's like well i hear from god all the time i get into the word and i'm inspired and i read my bible and i pray and i'm in the word and i'm studying and you get a little bit of an arrogance towards everybody else because they struggle and they they strive and they're not able to do this and they find that this comes up and that comes up and you lose the feeling for what it's like in the everyday and that's instructive to us that christ himself was effective as master rabbi teacher leader head because he was a follower he was sheep now this subject of wisdom as we're asking the question what does wisdom look like we've looked at it from the standpoint that it's the word we're looking at it now specifically in terms of it being meek the subject of wisdom arose in the context of family and what was in my heart as god dealt with me is that we're addressing a particular style of headship addressing a particular style of leadership that is counterproductive leader implies that people are following you uh to be the head implies that there's a body which is subject or there if you're the head of a family it implies that there's family that have submitted themselves to your authority or leadership if you're a leader then there's people behind you kind of going where you're going and so what we're looking at and we're addressing certain styles and characteristics of ineffective leadership that's actually damaging and not productive to causing people to follow or submit so the subject of wisdom is within the context of family and it's easy to create the wrong kind of environment or the wrong kind of culture within a family it's very easy and and i say this with a lot of uh empathy and i say this with uh with with a lot of um mercy contained in it it's very easy this isn't something we set out to do and we've got to be bullheaded and we've got to really really fight really hard to create the wrong kind of atmosphere it's almost as if it's just our first nature to do it wrong can i get a witness where's my hammond b3 getting on those flats and miners right when you hit that right it's really really really easy for us to do it wrong it just because it's first nature to get it wrong as i mentioned before i lord dealt with my heart and i preached a sermon on the seven bad habits of a highly ineffective father because i couldn't preach on the seven good habits of a highly effective father and i'm riffing on the seven habits of highly effective people and and i just realized hey i can definitely share all the things i've done wrong and maybe someone can learn from my mistakes it's just by nature being human and the nurture that we receive and that we find that it's easy to create the wrong atmosphere it's very easy to create the wrong kind of culture within a family and a church and if we if we promote the wrong kind of dynamics if we discourage the wrong things and encourage the wrong things or discourage the right things and encourage the wrong things we can quickly create a culture which is more fear-based which produces shame and is more characterized as something that's not building faith in grace but more shame and submission uh through fear think about that very deeply now personally let it be applied to your life that we can create a culture a fear-based leadership and instruction that produces conduct because of shame instead of promoting faith that produces conduct out of grace and i don't want to get lost in this but how many of you here have ever heard of cancel culture it's something that's very uh you know it gets a lot of buzz and a lot of headlines and it's it's really interesting because there is definitely a culture now to where things can swell up and if somebody does something wrong or an entity does something wrong something it whether it be an individual or corporation they they end up on the wrong side of an issue through something they've said or done then there can be a public uh up uh upheaval which says then we need to cancel that person they need to lose their job they need to lose their social media account whatever it is and there's a cancer culture that erupts and then there's there's a big huge upswell against cancer cancer culture and while cancer culture is wrong and because you cancelled this we're going to cancel you and everyone just pulls their guns and their swords and everyone's aiming at each other and you realize really nobody here's not wanting to cancel right they're all wanting to cancel they just want the ones they want canceled and the ones they don't want cancel never pick sides and it really has become everyone is part of this canceled culture and it's a culture which is successful if your cancer culture what you want to produce is canceling and the way that they achieve canceling is through fear and intimidation now when i think about this we're talking about wisdom the meekness of wisdom the context of it within family and how the meekness and gentleness of christ exemplifies the kind of nature that we should have in order to learn and the kind of nature that we should have in order to lead in order to teach so if you don't have this kind of nature you really not we will not be learning if you don't have that kind of nature you will not be able to teach so i haven't left that subject we're living in a time in a society now where cancer culture and this culture of fear and intimidation uses force uses threat uses coercion to abuse and dominate and it does it to dominate beliefs and coerce beliefs and and use a force to affect actions and it's actually a method to alter someone's behavior and to alter someone's beliefs if you don't change the way you believe we're going to cancel you if you if you act that way we're gonna we're trying to moderate behavior get you to change your behavior get to you to change your policy through the threat of being canceled and it's effective because people will change their policy change their behavior change their interactions change their beliefs all because of the threat of intimidation and force and so you achieve the result but let me ask you this is that the wisdom that's from above is this is this an up this is this something that's arising from real godly character and wisdom or is this something that really is devilish and sensual and from beneath i was going to take time i've run out of time already tonight to maybe amplify the terms bully and bullying a little bit or the noun and even the verb but i'll just skip past that we can visit it some other time but think about the methods that are used in society today to change someone's conduct and then be very honest with yourself whether or not on some level we're not guilty of the same within families or within other dynamics we may not have the ability to get 35 million followers to cancel somebody we may not have the ability to reach through social media and through and through political pressure alter the course of a of an actor or a politician or a corporation but think about your sphere of influence and those within your families and your relationships and the kind of environment that we can create within a church and challenge us do we have in some ways some vintage canceled culture as a part of our mechanisms it's only recently received this name cancel culture but was there a way that we could ostracize belittle and cut out people in a ways of canceling them long before it ever became a buzzword a few years ago i may have not have even been that long but i do think it's a few years ago there was a reckoning as it were i could just use that phrase within the southern baptist convention and even among independent baptist churches where there were numerous if not there was dozens of instances that begin to become become uncovered and complaints that begin to get uh major attention and where i was living at the time in fort worth there was uh it began there was like a uh an expose that was being done in a very large a study that was being conducted and even an article that was being expressed in the newspaper and they were examining how that within the framework of an organization and a denomination the southern baptist and even these independent baptist churches how that there was systemic and over and over again there was abuse manipulation and illegal terrible terrible conduct that was never remedied never addressed never dealt with and it was allowed to repeat from generation to generation and this this uh this journalist was looking into it and i want you to hear the conclusion that they came to that allowed this kind of abusive manipulated destroying degrading perverted behavior to persist within a church and this is the phrase that they use their church has created a culture that uses fear to control and gives men in power the role of unquestioned and ultimate authority how is it that an abuser thrives how is it the wrong kind of leadership is able to perpetuate the wrong kind of leadership how do you have people in these roles in these situations and you produce an environment that is toxic how is it you have the wrong kind of leadership and the wrong kind of headship create a culture that uses fear that gives people in power the role of unquestioned and ultimate authority now we could sit there and go oh my yeah think about all those churches and think about those denominations and think about those organizations the dynamic can exist within your marriage it can exist within your family because you use your position as i'm the head or you use the position that i'm the parent and at no point is there ever an opportunity to reason and to explain and to work through different differences and get out of this mechanism of fear and control that gives all the power into the parent and the parent has this unquestioned ultimate authority and because they have it they can never be held accountable when they do make a mistake and let me say this that healthy relationships promote mutual dependency healthy relationships promote mutual accountability and what this with this expose that identified this abusive culture that was taking place within a religious organization and within this convention was that they did not have mutual dependency they had codependency they did not have mutual accountability they had one-way accountability where the person at the top could tell everybody else what to do but if they made a mistake there was no means by which that person that person at the top could be held accountable for abusive manipulative even illegal behavior hey we're not southern baptists can i get a little bit more amens there come on let's just be honest tonight so without the meekness of wisdom we can create the wrong kind of relationship dynamics to grow to have successful relationships to grow children to grow one another to grow in christ the bible says in galatians chapter six verse one brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness this is a necessary characteristic in order to teach you cannot just say well the bible says that i'm a teacher therefore i'm going to teach no you have to first have the spirit of meekness you have to first be uh clothed and arraigned in this meekness and this quietness of spirit which in the sight of god is of great price before you can assume the position of counselor before you can take the position of teacher and the one that's going to admonish and correct you must first be the one that takes on this robe and this cloak of the spirit of meekness if you're going to restore and recover somebody who's made a mistake you have to first be meek because you consider yourself this is humility this is you being honestly aware of your own mistakes and your own shortcomings and realizing as you reach out your hand to the one who's fallen thinking you know what this very well could have been me but for the grace of god i'd like to help you i want to help you because i know that if i've been there before i want to help you because i if it wasn't for the grace of god i'd be there right now and so there's this honesty you consider your own self less you should be tempted and when this with the spirit of meekness you can recover someone it identifies that the one who's in the position to lift up the one who's in the position to teach the one who's spiritual in the position to restore can never properly be effective unless they first have a spirit of meekness without meekness what does it produce it creates that culture of fear it creates a culture of silence and if we don't have the meekness of wisdom our good intentions can actually be spoiling the the object of our intentions i i'd like to amplify this more maybe i'll just give it to you food for thought we often admonish our children and i use that gracefully saying we admonish our children about not being tattletails and we do it because what we really want our children to do is work it out right don't come telling me and and to work it out don't come to me you guys work it out and if we're not careful our attitude towards tattletaling can become so caustic and we chide and berate the child for tattling that we do more harm to the tattler than we do correcting the liar and we actually can create a culture with our children to where we're teaching them just to keep quiet and then by the time they become teenagers and we want them to open up we've already fully indoctrinated them in the culture of just keeping your lips shut and so we have to be very careful that in this objective of not your children not always coming to you not always complaining and not working things out themselves that you do it in the right way to where you don't create a bigger problem then you just lose in a few minutes of your time to slow down and figure out what's taking place so just chew on that for a while i'm going to move on so a lot of times this the problems begin with shaming and shining in a harshness in matthew chapter 11 verses 28 to 30 jesus says come unto me all ye that labor that means you are growing weary you're exhausted you're tired and are heavy laden you're overwhelmed you're overloaded with the burden now i want you to take this very personal not just one who's laden with sins but anyone who's growing weary and exhausted and feels like you're at your end and you're just overloaded and overwhelmed says if you'll come unto me i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me you that are over taxed you're growing weary you're overwhelmed you're tired you're exhausted in your calling in your labor as a housewife in your labor as a wife as a mother in your labor as a husband and a provider in your labor wherever you are in the economy of god i'm growing weary i'm going to exhaust them growing tired i feel like i'm headed for a breakdown i'm feeling overwhelmed he says learn of me learn my example for i am meek and lowly in heart here's your invitation i am meek and lonely and you shall find rest unto your souls if you could learn the meekness if you can learn the lowliness then you'll find rest in your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light this is an invitation if marriage of child rearing has become full of envy full of strife full of discontent you're becoming overwhelmed you're feeling over text i take that as a as a a just a a wave a hot blast okay all right we're awake now if there's any part in your life where you're feeling overwhelmed feeling weary and well doing you feel like they're strained you feel like they're strife you feel like something is not quite working here's your invitation to rest from that it is to learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart my meekness and my lowliness is the relief and is the rest from the strife my meekness and my loneliness is your relief from the overwhelming burden that you're experiencing in your calling listen the answer is say well i'm just stressed as a husband i'm just stressed as a father i guess i'm not just cut out for it i guess i'm just not i just should have never done it and i feel like i'm a failure i need to figure out my way out of it no no no you're in it god called you to it you've got the ability to do it but there's just other things that are out front as i was pondering i took i took the scripture references out of my notes because i i i just didn't want to get too caught up in this in this direction but peter's admonishing the women i said don't dress up with all the plaiting all the brai the braiding and the jewelry and all the fancy things he says but let it be the quiet man the inside man of the heart in meekness and quietness with those things before god were of great price and if you think about it what he's dealing with isn't just what's on the outside but it's a problem with the attitude that i'm going to put a lot of stuff out front i want to appear very beautiful and i want to appear very put together and i want to feel appear very well mannered but yet down on the inside if there's no meekness and quietness if there's no real godliness in the real temperament of a daughter of christ then everything that's out front is not going to do you any good and so in this in this uh this point of how christ is actually giving us an invitation for rest and for security and for assurance in our calling all these things that you're frustrated with you're overwhelmed and you're taxed with if you can just let all the strife and the overwhelming burden of fulfilling your duty as a spouse or as a parent or as a brother or sister in christ paul says in first corinthians chapter 4 verse 21 what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness what would you want a parent to do should we have the children vote you wanted to come with the wooden spoon with the switch the belt what would you want them to do come with the rod or come in love and in the spirit of meekness the correction of christ is in love and meekness we could read this what shall i come to you with the rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness this is how we can make the word fight against word well the bible says spare the rod spoil the child but you know it doesn't say use the rod and you you won't spoil them it's just a guarantee if you spare it you'll spoil them but if you use it incorrectly you'll spoil them just the same did you catch that we've justified the use of a rod by saying well if i use it i won't spoil them no but if you use it wrong you're spoiling them just the same in some instances you'd be better off sparing it then using it anger and animosity and a harshness because you create a greater perversion of correction and drive a greater wedge between truth and air and brightness and their hearts than if you just would have spared it you just want to let it go and this is exactly what paul is saying you want me to come with you a rod just a rod only if you spare the rod you spoil the child would you want me to come in correction which is in love and in the spirit of meekness our love even if you say well love is corrective should always manifest itself in grace and patience always manifest itself in grace and patience meekness is necessary for leadership the correction of christ is in love and in the spirit of meekness paul says i beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ it's because he told him beforehand do you want me to just come real hard and real angry and real firm and with the word of god this is what the word says this is what the word says have you ever been met with a with a with uh expressed your heart to someone says well did you was that were you talking about me and were you preaching against me and and were you saying that about me well it was the word wasn't it you're like well that wasn't the part that i was really bothered by i was just bothered by the fact that i shared it with you in confidence and now you just embarrassed me and berated me and abused me in front of all the people and i'm just trying to find some way to reason with you and what do they stand behind well it's the truth isn't it but it's not in the spirit of meekness and meekness is necessary for leadership as parents if truth is on our side then let meekness be our method and not force in our relationships meekness is necessary for leadership meekness is necessary for discipling we're real big on disciplining but really our goal is discipline in other words we want we want them to be followers of christ or followers of our good example that's what we're looking for in leadership with our children and if we do not have meekness and it stands in contrast to these different things that paul is talking about then we we impart we impart our instruction with the wrong motive and i want to think of a real succinct way to say this we're at 46 minutes just over 46 minutes already we should never correct and we should never instruct for advantage or for our own reputation this is not our goal our goal is not to produce children that make us look good our goal is to not be sheep in church that make arizona believers church look good no we just want to be pleasing to god we want to live lives that are overcoming we want the lord to be looking down upon us with favor that we're because it's the life lived well by the word and so our goal is not just to look good and remember the no filter concept that we shared with you we should never correct we should never instruct for our own advantage for our own gain or for our own reputation because selfish instruction will never edify and prideful correction is never remedial no it's never for healing it's never to promote correct behavior if you're just teaching somebody and instructing somebody for your own selfish gain then you're not really edifying them you're just manipulating them to do things for your benefit and make you look good now we're going to go into this restaurant you're going to sit still and if until you if you if i just even say one peep and if you act like this and you do this and you do that you know you right and what are we worried about making us look foolish as parents and making us look bad as parents and we're really instructing them in correct behavior but overall you know how bad that makes us look when you do that wrong method your goal shouldn't be to look good as a parent your goal should just to promote the virtues in your child promote the right kind so selfless instruction is not building up and edifying the child prideful correction where you discipline and correct because of a pride is not does not rehabilitate and administer and minister health to the child who's wrong it's actually destructive you're not building you're destroying that's why i would call it maybe discipline as opposed to disciplining you you spare the rod you spoil the child and we discipline we discipline we inflict pain we want them to feel it but really if you discipline out of anger if you if you discipline out of pride it makes the instruction whether you're trying to teach instruct someone or whether you're trying to correct someone it makes the whole goal it makes the result more punishment and punitive it's inflicting pain it's more retribution and so our leadership our efforts to try to work something out in a marriage our efforts in headship our efforts as parents if it's born out of frustration if it's born out of anger even in the moment that we instruct the moment that we discipline if there's hurt if there's anger if there's frustration if there's something bullying over the only thing you're going to impart in this instruction and correction is the same amount of frustration anger and and bitterness in the heart of the child or of the follower it's it's a lesson in ministry that if you're upset and you're frustrated and you're angry when you preach guess what the people are going to be frustrated angry and upset like man why are they so upset why are they so frustrated you sowed it you sowed it right into their spirits your impatience and and your and your lack of temperament and your and your frustration and i i i about had it and whenever you get to that boiling point and it's from that overwhelming sense of i'm weary i'm tired i'm exhausted and you you correct or you discipline out of that hurt you're only provoking that in the child it's sewn into it does that is that making sense to to anyone here brother brown makes this statement those chosen ones born of a spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk here's the example of christ the meekness and gentleness of christ the one that were to make our example who overcame by the word and humility who learned obedience who subjected himself to his parents who increased in wisdom the one who had the meekness and gentleness the one by which paul beseeched them with the the meekness of christ and the spirit of meekness and i beseech you it says he will train us he will guide us we will be trained by his spirit born of his spirit will be trained to be conformed will be trained to conform to his image in their walk he reproves he corrects he instructs with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy this is god's way god's way is grace and patience not law and punishment these are the hallmarks of proper leadership these these are the hallmarks of discipline these are the hallmarks of discipline these are the hallmarks of a parent who has an interest in their child to promote the right kind of virtue and see that it's character uh being developed not complex is god's way hebrew proves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy not rigidity not harshness not even consistency god's way is grace and patience not law and punishment that's god's way of training his children to be conformed to his image and their walk it says in psalms 25 verse 9 the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way he is meek so he will teach he will guide and he will teach he is make so he guides and teaches in meekness remember this is the this is the character we the the meekness and gentleness of christ the spirit of meekness the word and humility is an essential attribute to the guide to the teacher to the one who's leading to the great shepherd and who is he also likewise going to lead he's mixed with guides and teaches and meekness and so to learn we must also be meek the meek will he guide in judgment the meek will he teach his way so yes it's instructive to us to where we likewise must have the spirit of meekness in order to receive instruction in order to receive correction but if we're going to cultivate that and the ones that we're teaching our instruction and our correction must also be in the spirit of meekness don't come on real strong in the spirit of harshness and expect an eight-year-old to come back in a spirit of meekness in james chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness this is dishonor vileness he's talking about the state of mind which hinders our subjection to the word lay apart all filthiness and superfluidity of nodding nottingham say that fast five times that fast that fast that fast it's super super fluidity of naughtiness it means the superiority or the preeminence of evil it speaks of allowing malice to have the premise lay aside that and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls this is how we find rest in our souls all by the word and humility receive with meekness not with not being defensive not being self-justified receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls this is how we receive the word and if we're going to receive the word and meekness we must know that it must likewise be it's being sowed in meekness receive the word with the humble spirit and it being rooted in your heart it produces it produces the rest to your souls it produces peace it produces the deliverance in your souls in james chapter 3 verses 13 to 18. i'm going to read through it verses 13 to 18 and then we'll back up to some of these words who is the wise man and a dude with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with maintenance of wisdom but if you have bitter envy and strife in your heart glory not be honest with yourselves don't resist the truth and and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish this is this is how it is characterized if there's a wise man and dude with knowledge then he's going to exhibit his wisdom with meekness but if there's envy and strife if there's conflict if there's jealousy if there's manipulation or abuse this kind of wisdom is from beneath because it's earthly sensual devilish where envy and strife is there's confusion in every evil work so now he wants to amplify the meekness of wisdom give it some flesh give it some fruit give it to some characteristics so that we can identify but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace notice how he describes us the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy we ought to every single one of us try this code on and see if it fits we there there's no one here our challenge is from the youngest to the oldest who's going to say nope i'm exempt from that i can conduct myself however i want contrary to those attributes because i'm not a teacher i'm not this i'm not that no this is the attributes and characteristics of the meekness of christ which as new creatures in christ we're to put on these are attributes and characteristics against which there is no law these are the fruits of the spirit let it be a wisdom that exhibits itself in these things because notice verse 18 and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace this is such a beautiful beautiful statement it's such a vast vast expansive proposition such a beautiful beautiful foundation and itself a great covering and an umbrella of truth and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace mature fruit since it's the fruit of righteousness the fruit of proper judgment mature fruit if you have the right kind of fruit the fruit of wisdom the fruit of discernment the fruit of righteousness is first planted in peace by those who seek peace if you're going to see ever going to see fruits of wisdom then wisdom is first sown in peace by those who are seeking growth and wanting to promote growth the word is sown in meekness the proper fruit is not the the product of seeking to divide or promoting strife tearing down or causing shame as he's talking about this envy and bitter envy and strife in your hearts this is this is kind of the contrast to it the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace those that sold the word in a particular way those that sow it in wisdom will see the fruits of wisdom but if you have the word seed and you don't sow it in wisdom then don't expect to see the fruits of righteousness the harvest of righteousness read it this way or the harvest of create correct behavior is planted by those who act patiently and act gracefully you can you could just read it exactly that way the fruit of wisdom the fruit of wisdom is going to be song first in peace by them that make peace if you want to see correct behavior then plant the truth by acting patiently and acting gracefully let me try to bring this to a head you want to you want to see change do you want to see change in your personal life you want to see change in your marriages you want to see change in your family if you want to see change then get beneath and live above show grace and patience let those become the dominant characteristics of your personality of your character of the way that you address the situation not confronting it through just clear adherence and strict adherence to the word this is the hierarchy this is the structure this is the way things are supposed to be and you just need to do it this way and you just need to do it the way i say and if everyone could just get in line and get in step then everybody's going to be happy and this is the way that it ought to be but take a moment to take a step back take a deep breath breathe out exhale get some distance take a moment calm down relax and say wait a minute things need to change and it's ever going to change it's not going to change by me becoming more stubborn and more bullhead and more obstinate but it's only going to change if i exhibit grace and patience even consider family relationships this is the context of even what we're speaking about wisdom it's in the context of family what's the secret of success it's not force it never has been for us you have never been successful with your children by force now you may achieve the appearance of of adherence but where's their heart where's the security the secret of success is wisdom wisdom from above not force look at these characteristics we're right almost exactly at an hour wisdom from above the bible says is meek it's the meekness of wisdom and the meekness is with wisdom is known by these characteristics i'll just go through them and try to do it very quickly it's first pure it's clear it inspires reverence we saying i stand in all of you the wisdom from above inspires reverence if we can impart wisdom in the spirit of meekness or in the maintenance of wisdom it's clear and it inspires a reverence for it to say that it's pure it's free from carnality it is not earthly it is not sensual it is not devilish wisdom from above is modest and clean and and you can say in some ways the next seven attributes that are expressed are kind of amplifying what it means to be pure because there's nothing no hidden motive in it it's pure then peaceable it means it promotes peace it desires peace itself it desires accord it desires agreement and because it desires agreement it's personally willing to sacrifice for it it doesn't take these platitudes and these positions and and these unassailable propositions well this is the way that it has to be but it's peaceable so wisdom from above promotes peace it's pure it's peaceable then gentle it's modest it's gentle wisdom from above is gentle it makes a person patient and understanding if you have wisdom from above it makes you gentle it's not rigid it's not harsh it's not unbending if you have wisdom from above it's pure peaceable and modest it makes a person who has it very patient because they know this is what works this one wow is this one heavy easy to be entreated that doesn't mean easy to receive treats but easy to be entreated means they're willing to listen if you're easy to be entreated you're will you're not stubborn and sp if you're easy to be treated you don't sour quickly when someone says well but or i noticed this and i i was wondering that the easy to be entreated means you can ask them a question and they won't fly off the handle and immediately accuse you of unbelief or some sort of accusation or are you questioning my authority as your parent no they're just asking a question wisdom which is from above is willing to listen it's not stubborn nor is it sour wisdom which is from above is a good listener and being able to listen it's responsive he ever had that boss that they had to come to it on their own you could never tell them something was wrong because if you did they would take it the wrong way and you'd be in hot water so you kind of had to just find the most creative way to make sure that the idea was theirs not your own right they had to come to the conclusion themselves that one plus one equals two you couldn't tell them otherwise they would deny to their death at one plus one equals two that's not easy to be entreated someone who's easy to be entreated would listen to someone who tries to explain to them why they see it a certain way they and in listening they can be responsive to that person why because they're not stubborn or easily soured they're full of mercy pure peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy quick to forgive and they act kindly they exhibit compassion to the one that they're hearing the one that they're instructing the one that they're disciplining they're quick to forgive they act kindly they're willing to relieve the one who's burdened who's wrong who's being taught so they're full of mercy to say that they're full of fruits could imply that they're full of the fruits of purity peacefulness gentleness easy to be entreated full of mercy each of these dispositions is therefore manifested and produced in action and conduct they're full of good fruits and this is what they're not without partiality it's not self-righteous it's not influenced by self-interest and it's willing to give what is due it's willing to praise it's willing to encourage it's willing to give credit it's willing to say you know what you saw that when i didn't way to go that's a great job you're right i i just in a moment of honesty stop the tape i'm getting ready to bear my soul one thing this is me personally and now i can be held accountable this is for the first time i don't know if i've ever said this in my life oh this is gonna get good in my nature if i'm like hey i want to take out the trash i'm going to take out the trash you know what absolutely spoils it for me to be told to take out the trash oh my god i was going to do it i was going to take out the trash but they're literally you asked me to do it that just ruined it it's my pride it's absolutely 100 totally 1 000 every single bit of it don't blame god at all it's 100 aaron mcgeary it's the irish of me happy saint patty's day it's a beautiful cake thank you it is uh it is all in my flesh and what is it i don't like the fact that i was asked to do it because i was just wanting to do it and if anything it's kind of the opposite of this without partiality that if somebody does a good job thank him for it praise him for it if you're if your kid cleans his room on his own don't say about time buddy what is it you want huh what do you come what do you want this time that there's something about being able to recognize something and give someone their due without hypocrisy i feel so much lighter now thank you for let me bear my soul without hypocrisy it's not self-serving it's without guile without hypocrisy it seeks nothing but god's glory and your benefit now if you saw that kind of wisdom couldn't you just really lean into that and trust that couldn't you just say you know what this is pure this is peaceable the gentleness to it's easy to be entreated if i don't understand it there's a there's a way that a conver conversation can unfold there's a way that i can express myself they're full of mercy good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy that's something that we can benefit from in colossians chapter 3 verses 12 to 17. read it when you get home colossians chapter 3 verses 12 to 17 but it tells us as the elect of god holy and beloved put on bows of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness and longsuffering and let the word of christ verse 16 dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing what's the as the elect of god we must have these at our disposal as the holy and beloved we have at our disposal to put on bows of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness and long-suffering and that's the result of the word of christ dwelling in you richly in all wisdom and that's what gives you the capacity to teach and admonish and it says singing with grace in your hearts to the lord this is the example that christ is to us this is the example that we should be to others i've run out of time to amplify these verses so we'll move on from them but this is the example that christ is to us this is the example that we ought to be to others this is the behavior modeling we referred to these are the things in james chapter 3 verses 17 and 18 in colossians chapter 3 verses 12 to 17 if these are the things that we could seek and we could have in our own personal lives this is the wisdom from above that's going to be effective in family i had an exchange with someone here just this week and they expressed something to me in a text message i'm going to read it to you and i got permission to do it they said i have never gotten anyone's attention by talking about the word unless of course they were looking for an argument but when i just live the word i'm amazed at how the people that need it the most pick up on it immediately and it struck me and i just felt compelled to share it here at the end of the service as they express it you know i've never really been effective or gotten anyone's intention in just talking about the word unless they're looking for a fight start talking about something they want to debate they want to argue they want to have a different take on something then i get their attention but when i live the word the one who needs it senses it and picks up on it and is benefited by it now think about that principle for a moment then just talking about it it's not very effective but when you can live it those that need it can sense it and benefit from it and this is especially true when it relates to those to whom you have a duty if if you would just simply live the word in front of somebody else that you don't necessarily have a duty to you're not just talking to them about the word but you're just living and somehow that gets their attention and it has a benefit or it draws them to you or as they said they pick up on it and they begin to have questions if it has that impact upon someone you you don't even owe a duty then how much more is it important that we live that way towards those that we have a duty to how much more ought to we just not talk to talk but walk the walk when it comes to the relationships that really matter i just don't want to blow away the cashier at the grocery store when i give back the extra 50 bucks they didn't mean to give me when they gave me the wrong change but i want my wife to notice that i'm willing to sacrifice not take advantage and that i'm willing to serve even with my own children especially to those at whom i owe a duty so we read in the beginning colossians chapter four verses five to six yes this is my text and i'm just getting to it at a hour and nine minutes and 36 seconds and 38 seconds 39 seconds colossians chapter 4 verses 5 to 6 walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time taking advantage of every moment every second and then notice how it says this let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man he gives us immediately after admonishing spouses and parents and children and servants and employees immediately after instructing them he says walk in wisdom towards them that are without he says let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt so you may know how to answer every man now i'm just i'm leaving these with you i'm not going to amplify i'm just going to leave them with you to ponder and really think on deeply the bible says in proverbs 15 1 and 2 a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger now let's not just look at this in the sense that somebody says what time is it you go well it's 8 35. it's it's a it's a it's a life as a person expressed in the text message when i just live the word those that need it pick up on it it's not just the way that you answer questions but a soft answer a soft response responding to a need instructing or correcting turns away wrath as the bible says provoke he says in colossians say provoke not your children to anger so therefore a soft instruction a soft response a soft correction turns away and gets rid of the wrath and the frustration but grievous words stir up anger it'll promote strife within a person's heart it'll never resolve the issue it's only confrontation and fighting and conflict never addressing in resolution a soft answer turneth away wrath verse 22 answers to it the tongue of the wise useth knowledge a right the tongue of the wise uses truth correctly it knows how to use the message of the hour it knows how to use the bible it knows how to use the scripture spare the rod spoil the child it knows how to use the the the scriptures that speak to headship and leadership and submission it knows how to use knowledge correctly but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness can you say amen the mouths of fools will pour out foolishness so walk in wisdom towards them that are without be christ be meek lowly be gentle be peaceable to others because that's what wisdom looks like this is a wisdom that's compelling this is the wisdom that's salty this is the wisdom that gets somebody's attention and it says walk in wisdom toward them that are without paul said walk in wisdom towards those that are unsaved those that are outside the body of christ those who are not of the household of faith if we ought to walk in wisdom to the unsaved how much more are we to walk in wisdom towards our family and towards those in the faith how much more are we to walk in wisdom what is that in the spirit of meekness in the meekness of wisdom god bless you i've kept you lengthy tonight let's stand to our feet walk in wisdom towards them that are without think of how much more effective we can be if grace and patience are our pillars of instruction and correction as opposed to law and punishment let's just be honest all right since the uh the prevailing number of people here tonight or are married and raising children and they would look back upon how they were instructed even some of us not even we're not even raised correctly we're even raised by godly parents some of us may be even raised by abusive parents and in very horrible manipulative situations we've been in uh uh situations in churches and things where there was abuse and manipulation and control and just think of how the pillars of those relationships were often my way or the highway and consequences and punishments [Music] it's this way law and punishment law and punishment and how it was never exhibited that truth was upheld through grace and patience i think how much more effective how much more fruitful and abounding our relationships can be if we'll challenge ourselves as individuals tonight to say god i want for me i want for me i want to be characterized more by grace and patience i asked elizabeth this last week i think it was and say wouldn't it be nice if we had twin girls and we could name them grace and patience i don't remember what she said it's probably blacked out and lord please don't let this be prophecy but this is what we need we don't need more we don't need to mischaracterize this bulldog faith i just think we can just grab our children by the neck and just go for the jugular and thrash them around and then step back and be like all right you're gonna shape up you're gonna be the docile obedient humble child that i'm trying to promote the right kind of virtues in you're gonna have to find a way to achieve the right result the right way god give me the wisdom that is from above give me the spirit of meekness though this may be very pointed in a way to challenge us as adults and as parents in our method of leadership in our relationship that we have with our spouse and the the way that we interact with one another it could be instructive to me as a pastor there's different ways that we could take this and admonish ourselves and correct ourselves but can i just express this this way that maybe it will help you to understand the hurts that you've experienced in life and the complexes that you have as an adult they maybe give you a little bit of grace to realize the reason why sometimes i do what i do as an adult is because i was done the way i was done by an adult but now lord i'm going to break the cycle because i recognize now the way i have been led the way i have been fed isn't the way that i want to lead the way i want to feed and lord now i take on the headship and i submit myself to the meekness of wisdom not just knowledge but i use wisdom to use it right could we all do that tonight at the very least say lord thank you for showing me why there's things in my life and instincts and habits that i have as an adult as a husband and as a parent there's things i reach for things i say and things i do not because i'm evil not because i'm not beloved and i'm not holy not because i'm not the elect of god but because i've experienced a trauma i've experienced a hardship i've experienced behavior i'm modeling behavior that isn't correct i say lord now i know that i can likewise turn to you and look to you and say there's my example with head spout if you like to lift your hands before the lord and say lord here i am i'm learning i'm growing say lord take my hand lead me lord lead me lord i will fall need me lord i will go you have called me i will i will fall need me lord i will go you have [Music] we're just humbling ourselves to him tonight each one of us if i want to be a leader i want to be a follower i'm going to be a good shepherd i got to be a good sheep every single one of us now let's just humble ourselves become meek like lambs our gracious heavenly father tonight lord we're surrendering ourselves to you we're accepting your word i know lord that it's very pointed and very direct even very specific as it's been expressed testimony lord like just surgery like precision but lord we do not take offense to it we recognize the tender hand of jehovah that's promoting healing that's going into painful areas of our lives getting very close to that part of our pride which has always been easily provoked but somehow lord you've taken the scalpel of your word and with such tenderness got right to the very softest most vulnerable parts of our spirits tonight and he managed just to sniff at it in such a way people are willing just to lean into it a little bit more and say yes lord this is what i need yes lord this is what i need and i won't run away from it i won't hide i won't do as i did before but i'll say lord this is what i need therefore father we ask for your forgiveness if we have parented through pride if we have instructed for advantage for reputation we have led through selfish ambition lord forgive us if the pillars of our instruction the pillars of our headship as husband and father within the home the pillars of our leadership as pastor if the pillars of our of our formative and instructive discipline and our corrective discipline to our children has been law and punishment the lord may there be a spirit of samson rise up and topple those pillars today with the self-sacrificing that you might promote the pillars of grace and patience in our lives [Music] this is the meekness and gentleness of christ that we must aspire to lord to not only be taught but to be teachers i pray lord you take this group here tonight this many that could easily be numbered lord and may they become the force multipliers who so yield themselves to a supernatural power that suddenly results begin to take place within relationships within family dynamics that can only be attributed to you not because we found the secret to manipulating and using psychology and getting the best out of our children by some trick but lord you have come on the scene and made the difference that we never could i pray that you'd grant it for me for my family for this church for the husbands the wives the brothers the sisters the aunts the uncles the grandparents the believers that are represented in this church we love you we ask this in the name of lord jesus christ amen
