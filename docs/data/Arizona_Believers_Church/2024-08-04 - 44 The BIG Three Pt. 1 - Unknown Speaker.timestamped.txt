[0:00] I pray that the Lord would just be
[0:01] merciful to you all today and uh be
[0:03] gracious to you as the word is
[0:05] ministered that it would it would
[0:07] Minister to you and whatever your needs
[0:09] might be and wherever you find yourself
[0:10] in life that you could make it relevant
[0:13] my title today and I realized yesterday
[0:15] as I was studying that this would
[0:16] probably be a part one uh it's the big
[0:20] three and I am uh I'll say this at the
[0:25] outset that uh if you could just give
[0:28] the word your full attention
[0:30] and in doing so I believe that though
[0:34] there's a lot of elements to this that
[0:35] are kind of exciting or things that uh
[0:38] from a theological standpoint could kind
[0:40] of get uh maybe gets my theological
[0:42] motor running uh at the core of it it's
[0:46] very practical and very relevant and I
[0:49] would even say that um it's applicable
[0:52] for your heart for your home for our
[0:54] church in ways that are very personal
[0:57] and very serious as we were looking at
[1:00] the last several services on Liberty
[1:03] there was this theme where there's some
[1:05] attention given to the Optics of church
[1:08] and the Optics of how uh Believers
[1:10] Express themselves uh maybe in their
[1:13] worship and ways that brother Brandon
[1:14] was uh looking at certain things in ways
[1:17] that the scripture emphasizes certain
[1:19] things and in doing all that we could
[1:21] think well that was just kind of putting
[1:22] a Mark or a stamp on um how church
[1:25] services should be conducted but there
[1:28] was uh at the really part of that this
[1:31] principle that we could see in the word
[1:32] of God that we can apply to everyday
[1:34] life and I'm praying that God will deal
[1:37] deeply and personally uh with us as a
[1:41] church uh us as individuals all of us
[1:45] and I believe that he is in these things
[1:47] and I'm studying these things I'm just
[1:49] feeling more and more inspired to really
[1:52] do battle not by trying to chase after
[1:55] the devil but by getting into the word
[1:57] of God and finding out
[2:00] its secrets and the power that's
[2:02] available to us as Believers because I
[2:04] believe the Lord is really addressing
[2:06] real battles you might think even some
[2:08] of the things that we've preached as of
[2:09] late like oh well that's kind of a
[2:11] that's a nice take or that was put
[2:12] together well it's addressing real
[2:15] battles real things and so I believe God
[2:17] wants to do that now in 2 Corinthians
[2:19] Chap
[2:21] 11:3 and I believe it won't take long
[2:24] before you realize what I mean by the
[2:26] big three in 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I
[2:29] fear by any means as the serpent
[2:32] beguiled Eve through his subtlety so
[2:35] your mind should be corrupted from the
[2:37] Simplicity that is in Christ it was this
[2:41] scripture that was at the very heart of
[2:45] sermons that we begin to preach a few
[2:47] month months ago as it relates to the
[2:49] house of the Lord or our homes in
[2:52] particular and these these aspects of
[2:55] the serpent beguiling Eve through
[2:56] subtlety that focuses our attention to
[2:59] the garden and that our minds would be
[3:02] corrupted uh so that brings it forward
[3:04] to today like this present tense and
[3:06] it's this principle the Simplicity that
[3:08] is in Christ that Simplicity that is in
[3:11] Christ is so uh such a rich statement
[3:15] and such a rich phrase and there's a lot
[3:17] of things that you could draw from it of
[3:18] the singleness of Christ but it's also
[3:20] the abundance and the generosity of
[3:22] Christ and there's a lot of ways that we
[3:24] can look at it to where we can begin to
[3:26] measure whether or not we are in fact
[3:28] being corrupted from Simplicity in the
[3:31] way that we think and the way that we
[3:32] act and talk so as a serpent deceived
[3:35] the woman we recognize that Paul is
[3:38] bringing this uh application of what
[3:40] took place in the garden to the church
[3:42] as the serpent deceived the woman in
[3:44] doing so it caused the woman's
[3:47] Disobedience to God's word and we could
[3:49] see this principle that Satan did it by
[3:51] sowing seed he sews the seed in the mind
[3:54] and he SWS the seed of discrepancy and
[3:56] he says things that are contrary to the
[3:58] word of God in order that those seeds
[4:00] may take fruit in the spirit and then
[4:03] once it's kind of been received into the
[4:05] womb of the Mind it'll actually bring
[4:07] forth activity or action which will
[4:09] further that process of sewing seed so
[4:12] there's this metaphor I think that we
[4:14] referenced before how that Paul is
[4:16] saying as the serpent beguiled Eve and
[4:18] he seduced her from her duty to her
[4:21] husband so he's looking at that in the
[4:23] very readings here in 2 Corinthians how
[4:25] it has to do with the husband he was
[4:27] able to seduce her away from her Duty
[4:29] and away from her faithfulness and
[4:30] Fidelity to her husband Adam and that's
[4:33] that's
[4:34] the example that Paul is wanting us to
[4:37] consider when we would be corrupted we
[4:39] know that in Mark chapter 1 in Matthew
[4:42] chapter 4 Luke chapter 4 that Christ is
[4:44] Led of the spirit Into the Wilderness in
[4:46] Mark 1: 12 and 13 it says immediately
[4:49] the spirit driveth him into the
[4:51] Wilderness and he was there in the
[4:53] wilderness 40 days tempted of Satan and
[4:56] reading this it kind of struck me how
[4:59] that when we read of The Temptations in
[5:01] the other books uh it seems as if it's
[5:03] like Bam Bam Bam Bam just happens
[5:06] successively and I'm not saying that it
[5:08] didn't necessarily happen that way I'm
[5:10] not sure just exactly uh what time meant
[5:13] to Jesus in terms of days and what uh
[5:16] what this temptation exactly looked like
[5:18] in its Logistics but this scripture
[5:21] reading almost uh gives us the idea that
[5:24] over this 40-day period Satan was coming
[5:26] to him and tempting him and so it wasn't
[5:29] like he just woke up one morning and was
[5:31] really hungry and Satan just hit him
[5:32] with one two three it was it was a uh
[5:35] maybe something that took place over a
[5:37] period of time so Christ is tempted of
[5:39] Satan and he said the Bible says he was
[5:41] with wild beast and then we know in the
[5:42] end the Angels ministered unto him this
[5:45] temptation of Christ is very is uh an
[5:48] example of even what Satan did to the
[5:50] woman in the garden it's very
[5:52] interesting in a garden in a paradise
[5:54] where there was Perfection there was
[5:55] provision there was everything she would
[5:57] need Satan tempts the woman and then the
[6:00] woman who could have brought forth the
[6:02] word she falls through Satan's
[6:05] Temptation and here's Christ who is the
[6:07] word he is the he is the one that would
[6:09] come he is tempted not in a garden but
[6:12] in a Wilderness in a desert we know that
[6:14] he overcomes by the word and that those
[6:16] two
[6:17] tempations uh paralleled so today what
[6:20] we're looking at and we've made this
[6:21] statement before in some of our past
[6:23] sermons I think on the The Labyrinth and
[6:25] some of those sermons during that time
[6:27] Satan will attempt to lead the bride
[6:29] away from the revealed word there's a
[6:32] lot of things that we could get away
[6:34] from that are Traditions there's a lot
[6:35] of things that we could look down on
[6:37] that uh or maybe the uh the Optics of
[6:41] church and Christianity uh but Satan if
[6:43] he can get us distracted by all those
[6:45] things if we could get it in our minds
[6:47] that if we just do a certain thing uh
[6:50] that we've got the truth or that we have
[6:51] we have the Holy Ghost or if we just
[6:53] look a certain way that we're going to
[6:54] be okay he'll just let us be distracted
[6:57] but at the heart of it he wants to lead
[6:59] us away from the revealed word CU that
[7:01] is our mate that is our husband and he
[7:04] will seduce he'll try to seduce us from
[7:06] just simply believing God's
[7:10] word now I know that that may
[7:13] seem uh like maybe obvious I think it's
[7:16] brother Theo that's been saying duh a
[7:18] lot we were fellowshipping the other day
[7:21] and he was like duh and I was like
[7:23] that's right man it could be the new
[7:25] amen yeah Jesus Loves Me duh you know
[7:29] like get them sick them but uh let's not
[7:31] start
[7:33] that that was your opportunity um now uh
[7:38] it may seem to be kind of an odd
[7:40] proposition say well we get that but
[7:43] there's there's even these human
[7:44] instincts just as we saw it in the man
[7:46] and the woman when they fell and we see
[7:48] this Instinct in Cain and man has always
[7:50] sought some way to appease his
[7:52] conscience and to make himself Feelgood
[7:54] about certain things and so we have this
[7:56] instinct to try to do more than what we
[7:59] must do and what is necessary and the
[8:02] Bible teaches us and Jesus says very
[8:04] plainly only
[8:05] believe so we don't fear that's one
[8:08] thing we don't do but one thing we must
[8:09] do is believe and so I think there's a
[8:11] Scarlet Letter or a stigma that's tried
[8:14] to be placed that tries to be placed on
[8:15] faith in order for us to move away from
[8:19] Faith as the foundation and the premise
[8:21] and the basis and move into this other
[8:24] realm of proof and Vindication uh that
[8:26] we can do on our own to make us feel
[8:28] like I got it and it's very tricky the
[8:32] way that the devil will do it now if
[8:34] you'll turn in your Bibles to First John
[8:36] and you may already be there or still be
[8:38] there but for those who still bring the
[8:40] oldfashioned book and you flip in Pages
[8:42] 1 John Chapter 2 we'll start with verse
[8:44] 12 we'll end up reading uh to verse 18 a
[8:47] little bit later but at least to verse
[8:48] 17 here in the near
[8:51] term now let's try to walk through this
[8:55] together I write unto you little
[8:57] children because your sins are forgiven
[9:00] you for his name's
[9:02] sake as we read through this I want you
[9:05] to recognize how that he essentially
[9:07] addresses three classes of people he's
[9:10] going to address a child a youth an
[9:12] adult in each one of these languages
[9:14] that he uses and we could view these all
[9:18] of us whether you be you don't have to
[9:20] be a father and you don't have to be a
[9:21] young man you can either be a child you
[9:24] could be a a youth or you could be an
[9:26] adult and there is maybe more stricter
[9:29] constructs that they might use in the
[9:31] period of that time when they would use
[9:33] a word that oh that's person over 30 or
[9:35] that's someone that's under this age
[9:36] we're not necessarily using that but
[9:38] we're kind of looking at this non-binary
[9:40] spectrum where someone could just be a
[9:43] child some could be a youth and some are
[9:45] in adulthood and these we could say are
[9:48] stages of life and in these stages of
[9:51] life as uh John is walking through this
[9:54] I was noticing and I'm not I don't want
[9:55] to get too into this aspect but he calls
[9:58] out some specific virtue or character
[10:01] for that stage of life that ought to be
[10:04] ought to be something that you
[10:08] have I know you're thinking about this
[10:10] maybe for the first time so that's good
[10:11] or you're like duh say something say
[10:14] something we don't know and I don't like
[10:16] to say something you don't know because
[10:18] that would maybe put me in a really bad
[10:20] spot or you in a bad spot so he says I
[10:22] write into you little children that's a
[10:25] a stage of life because your sins are
[10:26] forgiven you for his name's sake that is
[10:29] something something that every child
[10:31] should be taught should know should be
[10:34] uh uh have a clear head about and and be
[10:37] certain of or be uh at least be
[10:39] confessing and be familiar with the idea
[10:41] so that is something that we could say
[10:43] we should teach our children that
[10:44] children should know because John is
[10:46] writing to them because their sins are
[10:48] forgiven he says I write unto you
[10:51] fathers because you have known him that
[10:52] is from the beginning now this would be
[10:54] the adulthood a more mature stage of
[10:56] Life at a more advanced stage not
[10:59] necessarily in age but in responsibility
[11:02] and maturity I write unto your fathers
[11:03] because you have known him that is from
[11:05] the beginning I write unto you young men
[11:07] because you have overcome the wicked one
[11:10] so you could see that in each one of
[11:12] these there's something about the
[11:13] fathers who uh have known uh something a
[11:17] long time and from the beginning these
[11:19] young men young people or youth they've
[11:22] overcome the wicked one these are things
[11:25] uh that not only as a child should you
[11:27] know that you're sins are forgiven but
[11:30] as a youth you should should have come
[11:32] to this place of a new birth experience
[11:34] to have overcome sin and overcome the
[11:37] wicked one and then in in traveling this
[11:40] passage we could come to a place where
[11:42] as fathers you continue to remain in the
[11:45] as adults we continue to remain in that
[11:47] faith that began even as a little child
[11:49] to believe that my sins were forgiven so
[11:52] there there's a lot here uh maybe to
[11:54] unpack and I might be getting bogged
[11:55] down in it says verse 14 I written unto
[11:58] you fathers because you have known the
[12:00] himm that is from the beginning I have
[12:02] written unto you young men because you
[12:04] are strong and the word of God abideth
[12:06] in you and ye have overcome the wicked
[12:09] one so he's addressed these three
[12:11] classes of people uh or three stages of
[12:14] Life a child who sins are
[12:17] forgiven a father who has known him who
[12:20] is from the beginning and to the young
[12:22] men he now has these three different
[12:24] characteristics to you young men you're
[12:26] strong the word of God abides in you and
[12:29] you overcome the wicked one and he's
[12:31] looking at this particular aspect that
[12:33] that's where that's where our real
[12:35] foundational experience with God has
[12:36] formed is in that youth in the certain
[12:39] time of life brother random even touches
[12:41] on it how that by 21 most people have
[12:43] made up their
[12:44] minds and that they're it's much harder
[12:47] after that uh to come to God and to
[12:49] yield your heart and the reason is
[12:52] because there's a part of the human
[12:54] brain that has fully matured and it's
[12:57] more susceptible to reason and doubt an
[13:00] analysis and it makes it harder for
[13:02] someone just to trust God whom they have
[13:04] not
[13:05] seen and can only know by
[13:08] faith verse 15 it says love not the
[13:11] world neither the things that are in the
[13:12] world if any man love the world the love
[13:15] of the father is not in him now that's
[13:19] quite quite a
[13:21] statement to say that if you love the
[13:23] world then the love of the father is not
[13:25] in you now let me call to REM the title
[13:30] The Big Three we're looking at Satan's
[13:33] Temptations or some sort of ungodly
[13:36] pressures or desires and how that he
[13:39] attacks how he sews seed how he's
[13:41] working against uh you as a Believer as
[13:44] an individual you as a youth you as a
[13:47] child or you as an adult this is the way
[13:49] that he works in every aspect and
[13:52] there's something that we can rest in as
[13:54] a child that despite how Satan would
[13:56] work against us our sins are forgiven
[13:59] there's something that we can take
[14:00] comfort in as a youth that no matter how
[14:02] he works against us uh we have we are
[14:05] strong the word of God abides in us and
[14:07] we are filled with the Holy Ghost we've
[14:08] overcome the wicked one and there's
[14:10] something that we take in consolation as
[14:12] an adult is this God who's been with me
[14:14] who I knew his of his forgiveness as a
[14:16] child and his overcoming power as a
[14:18] youth here I stand in this season of
[14:21] Life believing and knowing that my God
[14:22] is with me and so it is there is this I
[14:27] wanting you to know that there's this
[14:29] aspect that uh John is identifying
[14:31] before we get into the big three I want
[14:33] you to recognize how that uh there's
[14:36] this beat buildup to
[14:39] it and I will say this I thought I was
[14:42] going to minister on money women and
[14:43] popularity not only this morning but
[14:45] months ago and this is just how long it
[14:47] takes for me to get there and I think
[14:48] Wednesday we'll get there so you don't
[14:50] want to miss Wednesday night when we
[14:52] preach on money women and
[14:55] popularity is that going to make it on
[14:56] our Instagram or IG put out a YouTube
[14:59] short for it so three classes of people
[15:02] three stages of life and in each one he
[15:04] kind of admonishes them or instructs
[15:05] them in some sort of virtue or character
[15:08] uh that they have or he kind of calls
[15:09] out something that is rooting that is
[15:11] grounding and then he is instructing all
[15:15] three groups because now I'm kind of for
[15:16] looking forward he's instructing all
[15:18] three groups about the world and in
[15:21] addressing each one the child the youth
[15:24] or the adult he's expressing to them
[15:27] this power of overcoming
[15:29] this uh uh this grace of God that is in
[15:32] their life and as he begins to um come
[15:35] into this section of his letter as of
[15:38] his writing he divides the world or we
[15:40] could say the wicked age
[15:42] or uh our present time or Satan's Eden
[15:45] maybe be a better way of saying he
[15:47] divides Satan's Eden the world that we
[15:49] presently live in as being under three
[15:51] different headings or
[15:52] heads and uh we could call them
[15:54] classifications or types or or kinds and
[15:58] so there's this concept and idea of
[16:00] three I think most often we think in
[16:02] threes as God is perfected in threes and
[16:05] three has a real strong connection to a
[16:06] lot of positive things in the New
[16:08] Jerusalem in Revelations CH
[16:10] 21:3 it's speaking of the gates of the
[16:13] city that are made of one Pearl says on
[16:15] the East three gates and on the north
[16:17] three gates and on the south three gates
[16:19] and on the west three gates we know in
[16:22] the Book of Numbers I believe it's
[16:23] chapter 2 God arranges three tribes of
[16:26] the 12 tribes on each side of the
[16:29] Tabernacle in the wilderness that they
[16:31] all would have some sort of positioning
[16:34] there 3 333 all 12 facing uh the
[16:39] Tabernacle of God's presence the
[16:40] Tabernacle of witness this temple in the
[16:43] wilderness as you we could call it this
[16:45] house of God and there's three on each
[16:48] side and so we know that numberers 12
[16:51] and that they're arranged with three on
[16:53] each side and as I've been looking at
[16:55] this and thinking about it recognizing
[16:57] that God arranges things for particular
[16:59] purpose and inspired by what John is
[17:02] writing
[17:03] here there in the city of the new
[17:07] jerusem no matter what side you're on
[17:10] you'd have to come through a
[17:12] gate there was three on this side three
[17:14] on this side three on that side there
[17:16] was three on each side so that no matter
[17:18] how if you wanted to enter if you want
[17:20] to enter into New Jerusalem you're
[17:21] coming through one of the three there's
[17:24] no other option and the fact that it was
[17:27] the just as the children of Israel were
[17:29] rounding uh the Tabernacle of witness in
[17:32] the house of the Lord there in the
[17:33] wilderness to me when we see this image
[17:36] in the New Jerusalem it's showing that
[17:38] all must approach through the same way
[17:42] all must be facing the same thing all
[17:44] must approach through the same
[17:46] channel and so it's speaking to all
[17:49] mankind in these Gates so remarkable in
[17:51] verse 27 says and there shall in no wise
[17:54] enter into anything that
[17:56] defileth no wise enter into it the New
[17:59] Jerusalem anything that defileth neither
[18:01] whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh
[18:04] a lie but they which are written in the
[18:06] Lamb's Book of
[18:08] Life these three gates will not allow
[18:10] these three things anything that defiles
[18:13] anything that's an Abomination or
[18:15] anything that
[18:16] lies so the gates are not only for those
[18:18] who enter in but these Gates become a
[18:20] channel to keep things out and John is
[18:23] alluding to a similar image in the three
[18:25] gates of this sinful World these three
[18:27] classifications these three channels
[18:28] these three ways that uh we are
[18:32] tempted for it says in verse 16 for all
[18:35] that is in the world the lust of the
[18:38] Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[18:40] pride of life is not of the father but
[18:44] is of the world all that is in the world
[18:47] is not of the
[18:49] father but he has broken them down if we
[18:52] could say maybe would could have been in
[18:53] parenthesis but it is kind of brought
[18:56] out as a modifier the lust of the flesh
[18:58] the lust of the
[18:59] in the pride of life if I don't have
[19:01] time to get to it this
[19:04] morning we will We would like to look at
[19:06] these in more uh specific
[19:09] terms and the world passeth away and the
[19:12] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[19:14] of God abideth forever there's your
[19:18] secret doing the will of God there's a
[19:21] will of God what Master what was me do
[19:23] in order to have a lot of signs and
[19:25] wonders and some really good Riz well
[19:27] believe on him whom the Lord has
[19:29] sent and so here John brings a
[19:32] classification of three things he's
[19:34] already done it with the
[19:36] children and uh the youth and the father
[19:39] and even for those young men he's kind
[19:41] of look at these threes you're strong
[19:42] the word abides you've overcome but now
[19:44] he presents something very different and
[19:46] he uses these three different um things
[19:49] of the lust of the flesh the lust and
[19:50] the pride of life and this
[19:52] classification draws our attention not
[19:55] to God's perfection in threes but
[19:57] Satan's anti antiw word Trinity if I
[19:59] could put it that way something that's
[20:01] anti- word something that's an
[20:03] impersonator Abel built an altar and
[20:06] offer to sacrifice Cain did the same
[20:08] thing as these seeds mature and evolve
[20:10] you find that balum is numerically
[20:12] correct his typology is correct
[20:15] everything he's doing is seemingly
[20:16] correct why because he's very careful to
[20:19] impersonate into to mimic so he can give
[20:21] the image of something that looks right
[20:23] but beneath it it's not right and so it
[20:27] becomes a uh a number that is
[20:30] masquerading as God's Perfection but in
[20:32] reality it's just the number of
[20:36] man in Luke chapter
[20:39] 8 let's read verses 5 6 and 7 we'll skip
[20:42] to verses 11 to 14 looking at this
[20:46] Trinity this anti- word Trinity this
[20:48] Unholy
[20:50] Trinity and I thought that brother
[20:51] Brandon had made that statement I I
[20:53] couldn't find it myself that exact
[20:55] phrase this Unholy Trinity but it says a
[20:57] serwer went out to the seow his seed
[21:00] this is a parable that Christ is giving
[21:02] as he sowed some fell by the wayside and
[21:04] it was trotten down and the fouls of the
[21:06] air devoured it and some fell upon a
[21:09] rock and as soon as it was sprung up it
[21:11] withered away because it lacked moisture
[21:13] the Earth
[21:15] did and some fell among thorns and the
[21:18] Thorns sprang up with it and choked it
[21:20] so here we see three kinds of soil three
[21:22] kinds of ground we see the soil that is
[21:25] termed as the Wayside the soil that is
[21:27] termed here as a rock ER it's hardened
[21:30] and soil that is thorny it has thorns in
[21:32] it Jesus in verse 11 gives the
[21:35] interpretation now the parable is this
[21:38] the seed is the word of God those by the
[21:41] wayside it's describing soil describing
[21:43] ground we could even say it can describe
[21:45] the stage of a person's life where they
[21:48] start out with um by the wayside and
[21:51] maybe they get hardened or maybe they
[21:52] have Thorn there's just ways that we
[21:53] could look at even the same ground in
[21:56] three different characteristics or
[21:57] stages
[21:59] and it says those by the wayside are
[22:00] they that hear then cometh the devil now
[22:03] there's this tracking the way on the
[22:06] Wayside when that seed is swn it's the
[22:08] devil that comes and takes away the word
[22:10] out of their hearts lest they should
[22:12] believe and be saved so the Devil comes
[22:14] and takes the seed when it lands on this
[22:17] class of people the Wayside they on the
[22:19] Rock are they which when they hear
[22:22] receive the word with joy and these have
[22:25] no root it's in another place where it
[22:27] says in the El and no deepness of Earth
[22:30] in themselves they lack depth they they
[22:32] lack um a characteristic in order for
[22:34] the word to grow so it's a it's a
[22:37] condition of the
[22:38] soil you have the devil that takes now
[22:41] you have the soil which uh is impervious
[22:44] or can't allow the word to penetrate for
[22:46] a while they believe but in the time of
[22:48] Temptation they fall away and there's
[22:51] more color that's added to this in other
[22:53] places and that which fell among Thorns
[22:55] are they which when they have heard go
[22:57] forth and are choked with cares and
[23:00] riches and pleasures of this life and
[23:04] bring no fruit to
[23:05] Perfection so as we're looking at what
[23:08] we would call The Big Three we have
[23:11] these the lust of the eyes the lust of
[23:13] the Flesh and the pride of
[23:14] life and we have then also here as Jesus
[23:18] gives the parable the Wayside the the
[23:21] hard ground and the thorny
[23:23] ground and and then we have these three
[23:27] different agents when I when I need I'll
[23:28] call for it brother Mike thanks and um
[23:31] they're worried about my voice but I'm
[23:33] just I've been working on my preacher's
[23:34] voice and I found that if you scream in
[23:36] the mirror you get raspy I'm just
[23:39] kidding I didn't do that uh I'm just
[23:42] losing my voice this morning somebody
[23:43] must be
[23:48] praying so there's these threes we're
[23:52] looking at these threes I just want you
[23:53] to see this principle in the scripture
[23:54] very plainly uh I know maybe it seems to
[23:57] be uh this
[23:59] uh teaching Cadence with an evangelist
[24:03] sound but it's uh it's
[24:06] important so
[24:08] the there's the those three the lust of
[24:11] the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the
[24:12] pride of life the
[24:14] Wayside the rock the Thorns now you have
[24:17] three different antagonists or agents
[24:19] you have the devil that takes it away
[24:22] you have the individual who cannot the
[24:25] flesh which can't fully receive it and
[24:27] then you have the word world that chokes
[24:29] it
[24:29] out these are uh this is the this level
[24:33] of three the devil takes away the word
[24:35] the Bible Jesus in this Parable says
[24:37] your flesh is offended by the word you
[24:40] accept it but in the through the passage
[24:42] of time the flesh is offended by it and
[24:45] you've C you fall away of through your
[24:48] own offense to the word you're shame for
[24:50] the word so the devil can take the word
[24:52] away you can be offended by it and then
[24:54] in the end this third part it says the
[24:56] world chokes it out
[24:58] there's your Unholy Trinity the World
[25:01] the Flesh and the
[25:03] devil now in 2 Corinthians chapter 11: 3
[25:07] and 4 I fear lest by any means as the
[25:09] serpent beg galed Eve through his
[25:10] subtlety so your mind should be
[25:12] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[25:14] Christ I'm wanting just to use some
[25:16] scriptures to show how to view these
[25:19] three things that we're wanting to talk
[25:21] about and just how pervasive they are
[25:23] and it's not just some Niche thing for
[25:26] he that cometh preacheth another another
[25:28] Jesus whom we have not preached or if
[25:31] you receive another Spirit which you
[25:33] have not received or another gospel
[25:35] which you have not accepted you might
[25:38] well bear with him Paul's got some bars
[25:41] I like the way that he he lines this up
[25:44] he says that you preach another Jesus
[25:48] whom you have not preached that has not
[25:49] been preached and you receive another
[25:52] spirit that you have not received
[25:54] another gospel that you have not
[25:55] accepted so with each one he gives a
[25:58] particular aspect to it and so there are
[26:01] false Christ false spirits and false
[26:04] gospels you can hear a false Christ
[26:07] preach you can receive a false spirit
[26:10] and you can accept a false gospel these
[26:13] are these three this the this this
[26:15] Unholy
[26:16] Trinity ma in Matthew chap 26:
[26:20] 33-35 Jesus is saying you're going to
[26:22] deny me you're going to run away from me
[26:25] he was even in the Garden of Gethsemane
[26:27] where he's praying it's three times they
[26:28] just fall
[26:29] asleep and he and and Jesus seeks them
[26:33] the Lord the Bible says the third time
[26:35] Peter answered and said after Jesus said
[26:36] you're all going to leave me you're
[26:37] going to forsake me though all men shall
[26:39] be offended because of thee yet will I
[26:42] never be offended perhaps recall in the
[26:45] parable of the s that it was those who
[26:47] in a time of Temptation and pressure and
[26:49] persecution are offended by the word and
[26:51] deny it and walk away he says I will
[26:53] never be offended and Jesus said unto
[26:56] him verily I say unto to thee that this
[26:59] night before the Crow Thou shalt
[27:02] deny me three times
[27:06] Thrice Peter said unto him though I
[27:08] should die with thee yet will I not deny
[27:11] thee and Peter kind of gets a lot of the
[27:13] Flack here but likewise said all the
[27:15] disciples they all agreed we will not
[27:17] deny you and what do we know it happens
[27:19] before the sun comes up before the
[27:21] crows Peter in three different instances
[27:25] with
[27:26] increasing uh anger
[27:28] and rejection repudiation swears finally
[27:31] ultimately I don't know that man not
[27:35] only does he deny the knowledge of him
[27:37] but he denies the Divinity of him the
[27:39] son of man the prophet uh the Messiah
[27:42] the repudiation seems to be complete in
[27:45] the third
[27:48] denial it's great to know that in the
[27:52] end as Christ was denied three times by
[27:55] Christ Christ gives Peter an opportunity
[27:58] to affirm his love for Christ three
[28:00] times before his Ascension do you love
[28:02] me yes do you love me yes do you love me
[28:06] you know all things you know I love you
[28:09] you may know a lot of my Hang-Ups you
[28:11] know I denied you three times you told
[28:12] me I was going to do it right you you
[28:15] know who I am you know what I am you
[28:17] know what I'm about but you know one
[28:18] thing you know I love you you gave that
[28:20] opportunity for that restoration and
[28:22] that
[28:22] Redemption so where there's these big
[28:25] three there's also something else that
[28:28] that carries us and picks us up in
[28:30] Revelations 16: 12 13 and 14 this is
[28:34] where it starts to get
[28:35] real and the sixth Angel poured out his
[28:38] vial upon the great river Euphrates and
[28:41] the water thereof was dried up that the
[28:42] way of the kings of the East might be
[28:45] prepared I admire and enjoy Ministries
[28:48] that are able to take uh The Book of
[28:49] Revelation and some of these other uh
[28:53] other places in the Bible where there's
[28:55] a lot of symbolism
[28:58] and even the events that are transpiring
[28:59] under the open of the seals and you have
[29:02] the seals the Thunders the trumpets the
[29:03] vials you have a lot of stuff happening
[29:05] in the book of uh
[29:07] Revelation and uh I enjoy Ministries
[29:09] that do that and I think that I would
[29:12] enjoy ministering on it myself I just
[29:14] have never really felt like you know I I
[29:18] I I've done it in the past but I like to
[29:19] do it when it can be more than just
[29:23] data so uh but if we want to do some
[29:27] data Services we can do that now in
[29:30] verse 13 it says and I saw three unclean
[29:33] spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
[29:35] of the dragon and here's this symmetry
[29:38] again three unclean spirits out of the
[29:39] mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth
[29:41] of the Beast and out of the mouth of the
[29:43] false prophet three unclean spirits out
[29:46] of the mouth of the Dragon mouth of the
[29:47] Beast and the mouth of the false prophet
[29:49] for they are the spirits of
[29:51] devils working miracles shock
[29:55] Emoji which go forth under the kings of
[29:57] the Earth and the whole world to gather
[30:00] them to the Battle of that great day of
[30:02] God Almighty it's quite a statement that
[30:05] Miracles that will be worked and these
[30:07] Great Signs will be used to gather
[30:10] people
[30:11] together but not on the right
[30:14] side brother brandham called referring
[30:17] to the scripture called it a trinity of
[30:20] spirits and looking at this in a few
[30:22] places at least a couple places I know
[30:24] for sure he says a frog is always
[30:25] looking backwards he never looks forward
[30:28] looking back always back look back
[30:31] there's your three looking back always
[30:33] back look back back back back so these
[30:37] are three unclean
[30:39] spirits that are in amongst the people
[30:43] out of the mouth of the dragon out of
[30:44] the mouth of the Beast and out of the
[30:46] mouth of the false prophet brother
[30:49] Braham says and the anointed ones at the
[30:50] end time but when the Seven Seals
[30:53] become and open those Mysteries and
[30:56] reveal them that's when the frogs three
[31:00] unclean spirits like frogs come out to
[31:02] manifest themselves a trinity Doctrine
[31:05] against the
[31:09] truth there's that three-pointed
[31:12] club three unclean
[31:15] spirits
[31:17] three uh
[31:19] antagonist three uh warnings from
[31:23] John brother Braham says they're all
[31:25] Brothers anyhow and he's talking about
[31:27] The ecumenical movement that joining
[31:28] together Same Spirit he says and watch
[31:31] so deceiving performing Miracles and
[31:34] these are devils to go forth to all the
[31:36] gods of the earth working miracles to
[31:38] deceive them in the last day and will
[31:41] succeed in doing
[31:43] it it's three unclean spirits though we
[31:45] could do a different math under the the
[31:48] the six seal and the loosing of
[31:50] 200,000,000 demons that are loosed upon
[31:52] the Jews physically upon the bride
[31:54] spiritually and we can do different
[31:56] mathematics but we're not bound by
[31:58] typology we're not bound by the math we
[32:00] go by the truth and there's this truth
[32:01] that in its symbol form there are three
[32:04] unclean spirits that will attack the
[32:07] bride that'll work against the church
[32:10] that they will be for the purpose of
[32:12] gathering people together and their
[32:14] calling card will be the Performing of
[32:16] Miracles working miracles to deceive in
[32:18] order to draw people away to gather them
[32:21] together not for Revival but for death
[32:24] and for a great battle brother bam says
[32:26] they will succeed in doing
[32:29] it now I want you to not only take these
[32:33] things in kind of a this uh Church AE
[32:37] perspective and The ecumenical powers
[32:39] and Theological deceit and the working
[32:41] of powers and miracles that I think in
[32:44] our minds we think well that exists
[32:45] within the stage and the realm of church
[32:47] and church organizations and church
[32:49] movements a a and whatever uh
[32:52] conglomerations we might have or some
[32:54] sort of
[32:55] associations I but yet I believe that
[32:57] that we could be just as real when it
[32:59] comes to our individual lives to
[33:01] recognize that as the open of those
[33:03] seven seals are for us personally and as
[33:05] individuals and that our admonishment
[33:08] under the open of the word is to just
[33:09] live a simple life love God be out there
[33:12] with fire amongst the people holding to
[33:14] your post of Duty and there's a calling
[33:16] that we have under the open of this word
[33:18] that the devil through three unclean
[33:20] spirits and any way that he can use them
[33:23] through the mouth of the Beast the mouth
[33:25] of the prophet and the mouth of the
[33:26] Dragon will try to draw you away from
[33:29] your
[33:31] duty and he does It Well by making us
[33:35] look
[33:38] back wow how
[33:41] powerful an eye openening is
[33:44] that so John continues in verse 18 1
[33:47] John 21:18 Little Children it is the
[33:49] last time and as you have heard that
[33:52] Antichrist shall come that Antichrist
[33:54] shall come even now are they now I don't
[33:57] know I always say even now are there
[33:59] many
[34:00] Antichrist and he says whereby we know
[34:03] that it is the last
[34:05] time this is this urgency and this sense
[34:08] of discernment that these men of God had
[34:11] that we know that the Antichrist is to
[34:13] come and now that we see it working
[34:14] already within the church they believe
[34:16] that the the finality of God's promise
[34:18] and word was upon them because of the
[34:21] Antichrist how much more ought we to say
[34:24] we are in the final moments and the
[34:26] closing time when we see the Antichrist
[34:30] manifesting himself in the ways that we
[34:31] see him doing so now little children
[34:35] young men fathers you've heard that that
[34:39] Antichrist shall come and we know that
[34:42] he's not coming he's
[34:46] here and there are many
[34:48] antichrists that are working in this
[34:51] time it's that Wicked one working
[34:54] against the church now he's not working
[34:57] against the Church in in a in a fantasy
[34:59] spiritual
[35:01] League uh that just exists as an avatar
[35:04] on his
[35:05] screen you're
[35:08] it you're you're how he's going to work
[35:10] against the church by working against
[35:13] you and you want to think about the
[35:15] ramifications and just how this works
[35:17] and if you want to call it the butterfly
[35:19] effect or however you want to look at it
[35:21] if Satan can just start rocking your
[35:23] boat and then it causes my boat to rock
[35:26] a little bit and then it causes another
[35:28] and then there's this almost a
[35:31] hysteria that can reverberate just
[35:34] beyond our little family unit into our
[35:36] church unit and even sometimes into the
[35:38] broader message
[35:40] circles all by how he can work in one
[35:45] individual and we're living in the end
[35:47] time when these things are very real the
[35:49] Antichrist Spirit working against you to
[35:51] make you lukewarm and poers to make you
[35:53] fearful to lead you astray to get you
[35:55] looking like a frog
[35:57] right there's more reasons than just one
[35:59] to not like Pepe right there there is a
[36:02] looking back and a
[36:06] degrading and we've been reading this
[36:07] from Harvest Time I Think I do have the
[36:09] statement here well we'll get on that in
[36:10] a few minutes on the three Temptations
[36:12] of Jesus the three Temptations of
[36:15] ministers today where they make their
[36:17] fall three Temptations of the church and
[36:20] where they make their fall three
[36:22] Temptations of an organization where it
[36:23] makes its fall and the three Temptations
[36:26] in the individuals and where they make
[36:28] their fault notice how each
[36:31] one ministers the church organizations
[36:35] and the individuals if I was trying to
[36:37] make this all about the threes it'd be
[36:38] the ministers the churches and
[36:40] organizations and the individuals and he
[36:41] says each one have three Temptations
[36:44] which make their
[36:46] fall temptations that make ministers
[36:49] fall temptations that make churches and
[36:51] organizations fall temptations that make
[36:53] us as individuals fall three Temptations
[36:57] to a church three Temptations to a home
[36:59] three Temptations to an
[37:02] individual it's 11:10 I think I've been
[37:04] preaching about 40 minutes
[37:08] anyone want
[37:10] to put forth a i motion that we continue
[37:13] anybody second that okay good we got it
[37:15] we're just following parliamentary
[37:17] procedure here
[37:19] today now let's look at the lust of the
[37:22] flesh if I have to stop in the word
[37:24] let's look at the lust of the flesh if I
[37:26] have to stop on on this particular
[37:28] dynamic or one of these if we don't
[37:30] finish we'll we'll either talk about it
[37:32] in the Millennium maybe if it's
[37:34] appropriate or we'll get to it on
[37:36] Wednesday the lust of the flesh now that
[37:39] we've SE these threes the lust of the
[37:40] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[37:42] of life I hope that's kind of a good
[37:43] foundation for us to be uh maybe have a
[37:46] lot lot stirring in our Spirits as we
[37:48] look at these three
[37:50] things a lot could be said on each one
[37:52] of these uh so much could be said and we
[37:55] could look at the Greek words that are
[37:56] used and we could look at How It Was
[37:58] Written in aramic and we could look at
[37:59] it in the context of culture there's a
[38:01] lot of ways that we could break this
[38:02] down I just want to kind of give a real
[38:03] surface over you tying it very closely
[38:06] to the the message of the hour in the
[38:08] lust of the flesh it's a desire it's a
[38:10] craving it's a
[38:12] longing and it's speaking of kind of the
[38:14] lower animalistic instincts that we
[38:17] might have that I need to eat I I need
[38:19] to sleep there's kind of a passion there
[38:22] where my base needs are what I'm trying
[38:24] to meet and you can see that this even
[38:25] has some applicability to little
[38:27] children where the things that they're
[38:29] most concerned about is eating whatever
[38:31] they want to eat and not eating what
[38:33] they don't want to eat and sleeping when
[38:35] they want to and not sleeping when they
[38:37] should like that's kind of that
[38:38] describes
[38:40] childhood and we do spend the first
[38:42] couple years trying to get them to talk
[38:43] and run in the rest of their lives to be
[38:45] quiet and sit
[38:47] down and so there is a certain catering
[38:49] to appetites the lust of the flesh is a
[38:51] catering to appetites and the concern is
[38:54] primarily with indulging base human
[38:57] needs that there's some preoccupation
[38:59] with uh my My Flesh my my my my hunger
[39:05] and it
[39:06] implies not that you know you need to
[39:08] eat as brother Alfonso was sharing with
[39:10] me how that you know if a man doesn't
[39:13] want to work he shouldn't eat and so uh
[39:16] that sounds like a pretty good diet I
[39:17] don't want to work
[39:19] anymore and so there's this sense of if
[39:23] you don't want to do something uh if you
[39:26] you know like I work in order that I
[39:29] might have food to live in order to
[39:30] serve some other purpose and he was
[39:32] sharing that how that he wants to work
[39:34] and with his pain and what he's going
[39:36] through he's not able to so like so Lord
[39:38] if one doesn't want to work they're not
[39:39] supposed to eat I I'm one that wants to
[39:41] for the right
[39:42] reasons but this so This implies not
[39:45] just maybe some acknowledgement of and
[39:49] discipline to fulfill our basic needs
[39:51] but rather a lack of moderation or some
[39:55] intemperance where there is uh
[39:58] inappropriate emphasis on the
[40:01] Flesh and in so in doing so they're
[40:04] putting the body first we can look at
[40:06] this from a spiritual standpoint where
[40:08] is that God is pleased by our faith
[40:10] which is invisible which is in our souls
[40:11] but somehow we want to impress everyone
[40:13] else with what we can do with our bodies
[40:15] and that becomes even another microcosm
[40:18] of This Job chapter 23:12 neither have I
[40:21] gone back job speaking neither have I
[40:23] gone back from the Commandment of his
[40:25] lips I have esteemed
[40:28] the words of his mouth more than my
[40:30] necessary
[40:31] food I would say the lust of the flesh
[40:34] is anything the flesh needs that you
[40:36] esteem greater than the word of God when
[40:39] we begin to crave redos more than we
[40:41] would the word when we begin to want a
[40:44] churro more than we would want the word
[40:46] and in in reality be willing as Esau to
[40:49] sell our Birthright for a mess of
[40:53] pottage seems ridiculous but just
[40:56] remember
[40:58] that in these Temptations and where
[40:59] individuals make their fall rarely is it
[41:02] ever in the contract hey I'm pulling one
[41:06] over on you I want your
[41:10] soul no it's you can have this Kia Soul
[41:13] right and there's something being
[41:14] offered like hey this sounds great let's
[41:16] do this so there's something it's it's
[41:18] it's subtle it's very tricky but we must
[41:20] have this mindset as job did that the
[41:23] words of your mouth are more
[41:25] necessary and Christ goes a similar
[41:27] sentiment drawn from the book of
[41:29] Deuteronomy when he is tempted so when
[41:31] we look at this parallel of Temptations
[41:33] to Jesus in the wilderness the devil
[41:35] said unto him John excuse me Luke 4:3
[41:38] the devil said unto him if thou be the
[41:40] Son of God command this stone that it be
[41:43] made bread what was he targeting his
[41:46] hunger he was targeting this base need
[41:50] and this Instinct that we would act for
[41:51] the purpose of drinking and eating we
[41:54] would do what that which indulges the
[41:57] flesh flesh I believe one thing that is
[42:00] good about it's something I've studied
[42:01] and it wouldn't necessarily make a whole
[42:03] sermon but maybe leave it to me to turn
[42:04] it into a series on why we pray for our
[42:07] food and and how that at the very
[42:10] least before we indulge the flesh or
[42:15] even meet its basic need in order to
[42:17] function properly we bow our heads to
[42:20] acknowledge there's a God that's more
[42:21] necessary there a spirit that can
[42:24] provide and there's Thanksgiving to be
[42:26] given to God
[42:27] and blessing to be asked for because
[42:29] that's more necessary than what you're
[42:32] about to
[42:34] eat so Satan tempts him in this realm of
[42:38] the lust of the flesh remember brother
[42:40] badam said that as these three
[42:44] Temptations in the garden parallel The
[42:47] Temptations of Christ in the wilderness
[42:49] and he used these three the lust of the
[42:50] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[42:51] of life that's in the church age book
[42:54] Jesus himself says in Luke 12:23 the
[42:56] life
[42:57] is more than
[42:59] meat it
[43:01] is it's more than food it's more than
[43:03] nurturing the body it's more than
[43:06] feeding my wife and I have had been been
[43:08] having a lot of conversations and I
[43:10] think it's largely due to the fact that
[43:12] we have three
[43:15] teenagers and there is a there's a lot
[43:18] of wrestling with well what how do we
[43:20] navigate you know meeting needs and what
[43:23] is it the thing that we ought to be
[43:24] doing the most and what should we put
[43:26] our emphasis on and these are really
[43:27] good conversations and it's very very
[43:29] humbling but there life is more than
[43:32] meat so we may be doing a good job of
[43:34] feeding our kids and feeding our kids
[43:36] healthy which my wife does a tremendous
[43:38] job she's the food
[43:40] Zar and and so just defer all
[43:43] nutritional decisions to Sister
[43:45] Elizabeth uh because if it was up to me
[43:48] my kids would probably be really
[43:49] unhealthy and they'd look more like
[43:51] me and so I appreciate that wisdom that
[43:54] discernment that knowledge the knowhow
[43:56] but yet even though we might do that
[44:00] perfectly we've got to be feeding we got
[44:03] to esteem something more necessary and
[44:06] Jesus said life is more than meat and
[44:08] raising children is more than feeding
[44:10] them and the woman in the garden when
[44:12] she was tempted notice how this happens
[44:14] and I don't want to get caught up in all
[44:16] the scriptures and breaking these things
[44:18] down we've already used every I think
[44:19] every single scripture we're using today
[44:21] has already been used this
[44:22] year uh by someone at least but I feel
[44:25] like my I've used all these it says in
[44:26] Genesis 36 and when the woman saw that
[44:29] the tree was good for food so in the
[44:33] lust of the flesh there's some animal
[44:35] Instinct some base nature of uh there
[44:37] appetites and passions and Jesus is
[44:41] tempted to turn Stone to bread that it
[44:43] might satisfy his basic biological human
[44:46] need to to eat and sustain his energy
[44:50] but Jesus says to rebuke Satan he quotes
[44:53] the word it is written man shall not
[44:54] live by bread alone but by every word
[44:56] that that proceeds from the mouth of God
[44:58] why because life is more than meat life
[45:00] is more than bread and just feeding the
[45:03] flesh so the woman when she falls here
[45:05] in Genesis 3:6 when the woman saw that
[45:07] the tree after Satan has preached a
[45:09] sermon and swed the seed of discrepancy
[45:11] her perception changes and now the wrong
[45:15] emphasis I say wrong emphasis because
[45:17] something was emphasized to draw off
[45:20] sides the word first the word first the
[45:22] word first the word first the word first
[45:24] the word the word the word the word the
[45:26] word it's emphas ized over and over and
[45:27] over again by brother brandham it's
[45:29] emphasized in the word of God the word
[45:30] the word the word the word and then
[45:32] something is spun in such a way to be
[45:34] like
[45:36] but that looks good and so now there's
[45:40] been some sort of inappropriate emphasis
[45:43] it's the turning upside down of
[45:45] perception now she could have looked at
[45:47] any tree and said those are all good for
[45:49] food and I and it's been given to me to
[45:52] eat but once there became like this
[45:54] struggle and this wrestling to where
[45:56] there's this turning upside down a
[45:57] perception and then priorities she was
[46:00] willing to act contrary to even what was
[46:04] necessary she saw the tree was good for
[46:08] food in Proverbs 23 chapter 2 excuse me
[46:11] Proverbs chapter 23 verse two scripture
[46:15] we all know by heart and only quote to
[46:17] others and never remind ourselves it
[46:19] says and put a knife to thy throat if
[46:21] thou be a man given to
[46:22] appetite it's a kind of a Eastern phrase
[46:27] meaning cut it out right it's not
[46:31] necessarily
[46:32] literal but a man put a knife to the
[46:35] throat your throat if you're given to
[46:37] appetite it's the word we might be more
[46:39] familiar with is gluttony
[46:42] gluttonous it's a
[46:44] squandering lavishly consuming the word
[46:47] there uh uh man given to appetite
[46:49] gluttony actually the word means to pour
[46:51] out and so there it's this again it's a
[46:54] sense of moderation that we must eat
[46:57] we must drink there's things that we
[46:59] need I hope you're all getting your
[47:01] Macros like there's things that we've
[47:03] got to have and and to be healthy and
[47:06] for our bodies to for the brain to
[47:07] function appropriately for bodily
[47:10] functions to work in harmony there there
[47:12] must be an eating but we we might say
[47:15] that when somebody begins to give
[47:17] themselves over uh to gems of Cults and
[47:22] and cross training and running and all
[47:25] these things and they give themselves
[47:27] over to a lifestyle and then it has
[47:29] usurped the necessary meat it's life has
[47:33] become about the meat there's a Tipping
[47:36] Point when you're just pouring it out
[47:39] it's to excess and maybe you're not
[47:41] trusting the Lord anymore who can
[47:44] provide there a lot there to look at in
[47:47] the lust of the
[47:49] flesh I'm running out of time I'll try
[47:52] to do the rest of this in 30 seconds in
[47:54] the lust of the eyes
[47:57] it's the it speaks of the appeal to the
[47:59] eye it's kind of what's catching the eye
[48:01] and not just in
[48:04] the Optics in the the science of it or
[48:07] the literal uh taking in of light and
[48:10] producing the image but in the
[48:13] visual uh processing of the thing that
[48:17] is seen so it's uh it's the appeal of
[48:20] the eyes maybe the pleasures of the
[48:23] imagination and it speaks of even the
[48:25] Instinct that we have in our
[48:27] is not to need to drink something when
[48:30] we're thirsty or eat when we're hungry
[48:32] but rather kind of this instinct to
[48:35] Value things that are new things that
[48:37] are pretty things that are fun or
[48:40] enjoyable that's why it's people who
[48:43] really like to punish themselves and
[48:44] feel pain when it comes to certain
[48:47] activities like they're a real Paradox
[48:49] to some of us like you you just heighted
[48:51] in 150 degree weather you just you just
[48:53] ran rim to rim to rim in the Grand
[48:55] Canyon like I'll just uh I'll go to the
[48:58] IMAX right I never got the concept of
[49:01] the haunted house like what's it for get
[49:04] scared I'm
[49:06] like okay why would I do
[49:10] that and so there's this lust of the
[49:13] eyes it's the desire of outward things
[49:15] uh it's a desire for money this avice
[49:17] the uh wealth and good times and
[49:21] beauty and it it has to do with this
[49:23] Dynamic of coveting those things that
[49:25] are visible your your
[49:27] sight uh sees something and then you
[49:30] begin to desire and because something's
[49:32] desirable you act to gratify your sight
[49:36] Ecclesiastes there's a lot that's said
[49:37] about in that ultimately there's this uh
[49:40] satisfaction that a man has in beholding
[49:43] what he has so there's this it can tie
[49:47] to this occupation with vain
[49:50] entertainment uh things that just
[49:51] stimulate the flesh that satisfy the eye
[49:53] which Ecclesiastes tells us will never
[49:55] be satisfied right or
[49:58] plated but Jesus says in Luke
[50:01] 12:23 you say you already quoted that
[50:03] brother Aaron the life is more than meat
[50:06] and the body is more than
[50:08] rment in other words there's more to it
[50:11] than just what your flesh wants and
[50:14] there's more than just the things that
[50:16] are
[50:18] outward in Psalms 119:37 it says turn
[50:21] away mine eyes from beholding vanity and
[50:24] Quicken thou me in thy
[50:27] way we know that the eye is the gate to
[50:29] the spirit and that as we see things
[50:32] brother B says it almost governs all the
[50:34] five senses of the
[50:36] body that you'll see something before
[50:38] you taste it you'll you'll see something
[50:42] uh you'll even be able to see something
[50:43] before you hear it there's a lot of
[50:45] things he says you'll see it before you
[50:46] feel it he says he uses those examples
[50:48] just showing that just how great this
[50:51] sense of sight is and how it almost
[50:54] governs all five senses of uh of the
[50:57] body and the five senses of the
[51:01] spirit it's the psychology of seeing I
[51:03] think is the word he uses and he says
[51:06] the Catholic Church picked up on it
[51:08] that's why they have a lot of visual
[51:10] stuff for you to
[51:12] see markers and
[51:15] events and uh Saints who are propped up
[51:19] for miracles that have been
[51:22] confirmed it's the psychology of seeing
[51:26] Oh my I know sometimes it's the teacher
[51:28] that's accused of being a
[51:31] psychologist but the psychology of
[51:33] Optics and the psychology of seen the
[51:36] psychology of the lust of the Flesh and
[51:37] the lust of the
[51:39] eyes the lust of the eyes it's beholding
[51:41] with the eye that appeal it appeals to
[51:45] the imagination it appeals to the
[51:47] affections and reasons and conscience
[51:49] and it leads to coveting in the
[51:52] heart when I said that we are believing
[51:54] that the Lord is going to address real
[51:56] things
[51:57] in Matthew 5: 28 but I say unto you that
[52:01] whosoever lookth on a woman to lust
[52:03] after her hath committed adultery with
[52:05] her already in his
[52:08] heart what's happened just the
[52:11] eyes and it's not the glance it's not
[52:15] the Optics of the physical eye and the
[52:18] light shining off of the woman and the
[52:20] the light being received into the
[52:22] optical nerves and through the retina
[52:24] and all the and it being sent on the
[52:26] brain brain and the Brain flipping the
[52:27] image around it's it's not all that it's
[52:30] how all the other senses begin to
[52:32] interpret and interact with the
[52:35] data you can't stop the birds from
[52:38] Landing but you can sure keep them from
[52:41] nesting those thoughts that come in and
[52:44] we begin to meditate on them or we begin
[52:45] to indict them he says a man and this is
[52:47] very harsh and it's a very punching
[52:50] statement when a man looks on a woman
[52:52] turn away my eyes from beholding vanity
[52:55] empty things
[52:57] when a man looks on a woman then lust
[52:58] after in her heart there's the lust of
[53:00] the
[53:01] eyes so we find that Jesus in Luke 4: 5
[53:04] and six when Satan tempts him and the
[53:06] devil taketh him up into a high mountain
[53:09] showed unto him all the kingdoms of the
[53:10] world in a moment of time and the devil
[53:12] said un him all this power will I give
[53:15] thee and the glory of them for that is
[53:17] delivered unto me and to whomsoever I
[53:19] will give
[53:20] it here's the lust of the
[53:24] eyes see all these churches
[53:27] see all these kingdoms see all these
[53:30] movements see all my Eden and because
[53:34] it's kingdoms and churches you can refer
[53:38] to a nation in the as a female a city in
[53:41] the female
[53:42] sense and
[53:45] there's we've even looked at this how
[53:47] Jesus was being offered many
[53:49] brides here's the lust of the eyes the
[53:52] appeal trying to get him to appeal to
[53:54] this thought of showing him all this
[53:55] grandeur in this moment of time in this
[53:57] instance he sees something is this
[53:59] awesome isn't this great makes me think
[54:02] of a snapshot sometimes that we see of
[54:04] some say wow that's powerful that's
[54:06] awesome but what about Monday
[54:15] morning Jesus is tempted through the
[54:17] lust of the eyes when he sees these
[54:18] kingdoms and then the woman in the
[54:20] Garden of Eden Genesis chter 3:6 and the
[54:23] woman when the woman saw that the tree
[54:25] was not just good for food and that it
[54:28] was pleasant to the
[54:31] eyes now we have seen the lust of the
[54:33] flesh working upon the woman the lust of
[54:35] the flesh working upon Christ the lust
[54:37] of the eyes working upon the woman the
[54:39] lust of the eyes working upon Christ and
[54:41] we know that Satan is going to try to
[54:43] tempt Us in this end
[54:45] time and when the woman saw that this
[54:48] tree was pleasant to the eyes it is not
[54:50] beautiful to the sight but it was
[54:51] stimulating to her spirit emotionally
[54:55] stimulating
[54:57] there's a way that we can act to satisfy
[54:59] the body then there's a way that we can
[55:01] act to satisfy our
[55:03] emotions there are these temptations
[55:05] that we must be so keenly aware
[55:08] of the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[55:11] eyes and the pride of
[55:15] life pride is that Vang
[55:18] glorium it speaks of vanity so it's
[55:21] empty these empty displays it's foolish
[55:24] Pursuits there's no wisdom or substance
[55:26] to it
[55:27] things that are arrogant and
[55:30] presumptuous I just use that it's a
[55:32] thought of it's an empty
[55:36] display it's that it's this enticement
[55:40] or this urement but there's really
[55:41] nothing in it it's not what it purported
[55:44] to
[55:45] be it's what it's what Commerce has
[55:48] become it's what social media has
[55:52] become and to this pride of life it has
[55:55] to do the pride is rooted in this vanity
[55:57] or these vain glorious displays of
[56:01] things the pride of life it's a desire
[56:05] for
[56:06] recognition desire for Prestige or honor
[56:09] some sort of acceptance through activity
[56:11] or lifestyle you'll find that many
[56:13] people today are caught up in the pride
[56:15] of life because they will present
[56:17] themselves in ways so that they can find
[56:19] acceptance by others who present a
[56:21] similar way it's no different than maybe
[56:24] the the skaters and the punks and The
[56:27] Ropers and the gangsters or whatever
[56:29] else the jocks that you have in high
[56:31] school sometimes there's just this pride
[56:32] of identity and
[56:34] acceptance this coveting for recognition
[56:36] this lusting after praise good job
[56:39] you're part of us you're in the
[56:41] crowd it's the vanity of P certain
[56:45] Pursuits ranking clout
[56:48] Karma it's the Pharisees all over again
[56:52] it's the art of showing off or
[56:54] pretending to be something that you're
[56:58] not in Matthew chap 23: 5 and 6 he says
[57:01] but all their Works they do for to be
[57:03] seen of men pride of life they make
[57:07] broad their filteries and enlarge the
[57:09] borders of their garments have we ever
[57:12] asked you know could we broaden our
[57:13] filteries a little bit uh they make
[57:16] broaden their filteries and enlarge the
[57:17] borders of their garments why to be
[57:19] seen to appear Pious and righteous to be
[57:22] like whoa that's a
[57:24] preacher that must have been some
[57:27] service and love the uppermost rooms at
[57:30] feast and the chief seats in the
[57:33] synagogues and greetings in the markets
[57:35] and to be called of men Rabbi
[57:38] Rabbi Robbie
[57:41] Robbie all their Works they do to be
[57:43] seen of men so they broaden their filors
[57:46] they enlarge the boards of their
[57:47] garments they love the chief seats they
[57:50] love the the upper rooms the Separate
[57:54] Tables
[57:56] they they love to be
[58:00] identified one time a man visited a
[58:04] church Vis he had a Bible in his arm and
[58:06] he said where do the minister sit I was
[58:09] like right there right there right there
[58:13] just take your seat
[58:20] pal Jesus says in Matthew chap 6: 25
[58:24] therefore I say unto you take no thought
[58:26] for your
[58:27] life remember life is more than meat and
[58:30] the body is more than rainment so take
[58:32] no thought for your life what you shall
[58:34] eat what you shall drink nor yet for
[58:36] your body what you shall put on there's
[58:38] your three eating drinking and what
[58:40] you'll wear what you put is is not life
[58:43] more than meat and the body
[58:46] rainment isn't there more to life than
[58:48] where we eat and what we eat what we
[58:52] wear and and what what we display and
[58:55] what we broadcast
[59:00] status conspicuous consumption the way
[59:03] that we like the
[59:05] signal now make it very real and
[59:07] practical for your own life I think this
[59:09] is hits on a number of levels and it's
[59:12] not that we shouldn't uh pay attention
[59:14] to what we wear and it's not that we
[59:15] shouldn't maybe be more uh better with
[59:19] our money to where we buy it once and
[59:20] that's it and we buy it for life cuz it
[59:22] last and we and we want to have good
[59:24] things and we want to have high I mean
[59:26] some of us just have champagne taste
[59:28] whatever that
[59:30] means but that's a term they
[59:32] use and so in Luke we see Jesus is
[59:37] tempted with the same thing I apologize
[59:39] for the length of this I do want to
[59:41] finish in Luke 4: 9- 11 now Satan he
[59:45] brought him to Jerusalem and set him on
[59:48] a pinnacle of the temple and said unto
[59:49] him if thou be the Son of God cast
[59:53] thyself down from hence for it is
[59:55] written he shall give his angels charge
[59:57] over thee to keep thee and in their
[59:59] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:00:01] any time thou Dash thy foot against a
[1:00:06] stone the pride of
[1:00:08] life the sin of
[1:00:11] Pride the sin of
[1:00:13] sins the very thing that animated
[1:00:15] Lucifer is the very thing he's trying on
[1:00:18] Christ it was my pride that made me
[1:00:23] act perhaps I can get your pride
[1:00:26] to do the
[1:00:27] same it's the origin of sin the sin of
[1:00:31] Pride the sin of presuming and
[1:00:32] presumption this presumption trying to
[1:00:35] get Jesus to do what the woman
[1:00:39] did God doth know that the day you eat
[1:00:42] thereof you'll
[1:00:44] become you'll
[1:00:46] know this is what God maybe wants after
[1:00:50] all or you'll become as gods in this
[1:00:52] knowledge that's
[1:00:53] promised so as Jesus was tempted on the
[1:00:57] Pinnacle of the temple to cast himself
[1:00:58] down the sin of presumption that God is
[1:01:01] going to vindicate me and God will
[1:01:03] answer me because this is what the word
[1:01:05] says and this spiritual justification
[1:01:07] this sin of Pride for
[1:01:10] acknowledgement to be rescued to be
[1:01:12] affirmed to be Vindicated each one of
[1:01:13] these you can say pride is at the core
[1:01:15] prove you're a Son of God prove you're a
[1:01:16] daughter of God prove you're a real
[1:01:17] message
[1:01:20] believer we've got Spirit yes we do
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:27] anybody does that to you say sorry I'm
[1:01:29] not a cheerleader I'm in the
[1:01:30] arena I'm not in the stands I'm
[1:01:33] fighting you you can have your pep
[1:01:35] rallies and your cheerleading and all
[1:01:36] your gymnastics but I want the word I
[1:01:39] want to be in the trenches I want to be
[1:01:40] in faith and
[1:01:43] overcoming in Genesis 3:6 and when woman
[1:01:45] saw that the tree was not just good for
[1:01:48] food the lust of the Flesh and not just
[1:01:51] Pleasant to the eyes the lust of the
[1:01:52] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[1:01:55] one wise
[1:01:56] eyes the pride of life this is her drive
[1:02:00] this is her motivation it's a lust to
[1:02:03] know beyond what God has revealed a lust
[1:02:06] to act beyond what God has told you to
[1:02:08] act a lust to do yourself what God said
[1:02:12] he would do in his time and his season
[1:02:14] the pride of
[1:02:18] life in Colossians chapter 2
[1:02:21] ver8 Paul is speaking a very similar
[1:02:23] language to that which he does to the
[1:02:25] Corinthians and the beguiling the
[1:02:27] deceiving he says beware lest any man
[1:02:29] spoil you and we're kind of like I don't
[1:02:32] mind being
[1:02:33] spoiled but it means to be carried off
[1:02:35] his
[1:02:36] booty Savvy it's exactly what he's
[1:02:39] saying going to carry you away as a
[1:02:41] treasure going to steal your
[1:02:44] away it's to come under the sway of the
[1:02:47] influence of Beware lest any man spoil
[1:02:50] you to cause you to come under the sway
[1:02:52] of and to be carried away captive as a
[1:02:56] a frog and unclean Spirit trying to drag
[1:02:58] you back through philos and vain
[1:03:03] deceit after the tradition of men after
[1:03:06] the rudiments the ordinances of the
[1:03:09] world this pride of worldly knowledge
[1:03:13] this pride of life where they use
[1:03:15] philosophy and vain
[1:03:17] deceit the traditions of men in
[1:03:20] ordinances of the world rudiments of the
[1:03:23] world there's another if you want to put
[1:03:26] it in that category to spoil you and
[1:03:30] then what's amazing is Paul
[1:03:32] says to beware lest any man spoil you
[1:03:35] through those things and not spoil you
[1:03:39] with
[1:03:41] Christ who is the word who is the one
[1:03:44] we're feeding on who's the one who's
[1:03:46] leading
[1:03:49] us but John is the big three the next
[1:03:52] slide I'm on it
[1:03:57] all that is in the
[1:04:00] world the devil sin the fleshes that
[1:04:04] exist Within These Realms of the
[1:04:06] world five senses to contact a Earthly
[1:04:08] home five senses to relate and animate
[1:04:10] with other men and other people that
[1:04:12] populate this
[1:04:13] world money women and
[1:04:17] popularity are you going you going to be
[1:04:19] here early Wednesday we'll make sure the
[1:04:20] building's plenty
[1:04:22] cool The Big
[1:04:24] Three the lust of the
[1:04:26] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[1:04:30] of
[1:04:31] life John he comes to the close of this
[1:04:34] chapter so I'll try to close my sermon
[1:04:36] right here in 1 John 5:
[1:04:38] 4-9 for whatsoever is born of God
[1:04:42] overcometh the
[1:04:45] world whatsoever is born of
[1:04:49] God overcomes the world and if you
[1:04:52] overcome the world you overcome all that
[1:04:55] is in them the world and this is the
[1:04:58] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:05:00] our
[1:05:03] faith who is he that overcometh the
[1:05:06] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:05:10] is the son of
[1:05:11] God this is our Victory faith is the
[1:05:14] victory the victory that overcometh the
[1:05:16] world even our faith who is he that
[1:05:18] overcometh the world he who is he that
[1:05:21] overcometh sin the World the Flesh the
[1:05:23] devil who is it that overcomes the lust
[1:05:25] of the flesh lust of the eyes and the
[1:05:26] pride of life he that believes that
[1:05:28] Jesus is the son of God this is he that
[1:05:31] come came by water and blood even Jesus
[1:05:34] Christ not by water only but by water
[1:05:36] and
[1:05:38] blood and it is the spirit that beareth
[1:05:41] witness because the spirit is truth I
[1:05:43] know there's a lot here I'm wanting just
[1:05:45] to kind of marinate you with this for
[1:05:48] there are three that bear record in
[1:05:50] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[1:05:53] Ghost and these three are
[1:05:58] one and there are three that bear
[1:06:00] witness in the Earth the spirit and the
[1:06:02] water and the blood and these three
[1:06:04] agree in one so there's your three
[1:06:09] still if we receive the witness of
[1:06:13] men the witness of God is
[1:06:15] greater and there's there's something to
[1:06:18] be said about the witness of men he's
[1:06:19] not completely discounting that I
[1:06:20] believe in the context of this but he
[1:06:22] saying the witness of God is greater for
[1:06:24] this is the witness of God which yet
[1:06:26] testified of his son what You Know by
[1:06:29] Revelation What You Know by the
[1:06:30] confirmation of the Holy Ghost What You
[1:06:32] Know by the teacher the Insight teacher
[1:06:34] What You Know by God disclosing himself
[1:06:36] to you that's the greater witness it's
[1:06:39] greater than oil pourn out of your hands
[1:06:41] it's greater than blood coming out of
[1:06:43] your forehead to know God by the
[1:06:45] revelation of his word that's the
[1:06:47] greatest
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:50] witness the big
[1:06:54] three and make you subject to these
[1:06:56] three
[1:06:57] Temptations the lust of the flesh the
[1:06:59] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:07:02] but I ask the question brother John that
[1:07:03] last
[1:07:05] Slide the big
[1:07:10] three pause for dramatic
[1:07:12] effect the big
[1:07:16] three or is it the greatest
[1:07:21] one God the word the Holy Ghost are one
[1:07:27] Spirit and the water and the blood they
[1:07:29] agree in
[1:07:30] one when brother bom is teaching these
[1:07:32] very things he talks about how that the
[1:07:34] spirit can be upon the body and the the
[1:07:38] flesh the body whether you say flesh and
[1:07:41] spirit or or the the flesh is body and
[1:07:43] spirit however you want to look at it
[1:07:44] but those two the Holy Spirit can be on
[1:07:46] that in all sorts of crazy ways and
[1:07:49] Powerful ways and hard to understand
[1:07:51] ways and he's like you can still be lost
[1:07:55] so what is it the big
[1:07:58] three or is it just
[1:08:00] one God the
[1:08:04] word what is it for
[1:08:07] you the three flesh eyes and life or can
[1:08:12] it be one the way the truth the
[1:08:16] life let's bow our heads and pray
[1:08:20] musicians you could even just hold your
[1:08:21] seats for a moment you can remain in
[1:08:23] your seats if you'd like
[1:08:26] this has been very
[1:08:31] direct we're doing battle
[1:08:37] scenes I could say we're fighting for
[1:08:40] our lives but you know that that we do
[1:08:43] that when we
[1:08:46] drive fighting for
[1:08:49] Souls we're fighting for
[1:08:52] harmony within ourselves and within our
[1:08:54] homes
[1:08:57] and I ask that you pray for me this
[1:09:04] morning I want to do
[1:09:07] battle for myself for my home for my
[1:09:11] wife for my marriage for my children for
[1:09:13] our church for our
[1:09:18] friends I don't like what the devil does
[1:09:21] to
[1:09:24] us and I believe that God is doing
[1:09:26] miracles in your lives there's healing
[1:09:28] there's
[1:09:29] restoration but I want to find
[1:09:31] everywhere there's an imp and everywhere
[1:09:33] there's a
[1:09:34] devil I want to search the word so
[1:09:38] deeply and so completely that he finds
[1:09:41] every imp and every devil and every Scar
[1:09:43] and every sore spot and every weakness
[1:09:46] and His holy spirit Shores it
[1:09:51] up so I ask you today to consider
[1:09:55] consider the big
[1:09:59] three and
[1:10:05] ask and ask for the one to help you
[1:10:10] gracious heavenly father I pray today
[1:10:12] for these people they've
[1:10:14] endured they've persevered they've
[1:10:18] listened they've appropriately responded
[1:10:21] it's been quiet at times because they're
[1:10:24] listening
[1:10:27] and Lord I believe as I look out upon
[1:10:28] the congregation I don't sense any
[1:10:31] resentment I believe all fears crossed
[1:10:35] out I believe there's a spirit of unity
[1:10:37] Lord you've been addressing things and
[1:10:39] reconciling things Lord and you just
[1:10:41] watch out over congregation to make sure
[1:10:43] that its makeup is just right to fulfill
[1:10:46] the purpose you have for that moment and
[1:10:47] that
[1:10:49] time and so Lord I pray right now that
[1:10:51] you would
[1:10:53] come and give us WI
[1:10:57] witness greater
[1:11:00] witness Lord I don't want to
[1:11:03] be fighting my own
[1:11:06] battles I don't want to be chasing after
[1:11:08] things that have been
[1:11:10] lost but I want to be in your word
[1:11:13] Lord I want to I want to know you
[1:11:17] more and Lord we are not in the word by
[1:11:21] mentally accepting it we're not in
[1:11:24] Christ by verbally saying
[1:11:26] it we got to Know You by
[1:11:29] revelation we got to know you in that
[1:11:31] one place the
[1:11:34] soul so I'm praying for my children Lord
[1:11:38] this church our young
[1:11:40] people our
[1:11:42] families Lord may we know you in that
[1:11:45] deep and personal
[1:11:46] way father those of us who have this
[1:11:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost those of us
[1:11:50] who believe that we have been walking in
[1:11:52] the light of this birth and we struggle
[1:11:54] and we get cold told and we've wondered
[1:11:56] and we've let people down and we make
[1:11:57] mistakes
[1:11:59] and maybe we've offended and we've hurt
[1:12:02] and we say and do things that we know we
[1:12:04] should not do Lord may we recognize the
[1:12:08] casualties and the consequences of the
[1:12:10] battle with the big
[1:12:12] three may we recognize the tactics of
[1:12:14] the enemy in the garden in the
[1:12:15] wilderness and realize that in the end
[1:12:17] time we were not going to be exempt from
[1:12:21] Temptation and that our way out of
[1:12:24] Temptation was not to excite the same
[1:12:27] neurons that led us into
[1:12:30] it but to feed our
[1:12:33] souls and to purpose in our hearts by
[1:12:35] faith to walk in your word and do that
[1:12:37] which is right so Lord I pray that you
[1:12:40] give us as children
[1:12:42] victory that you give us a confirmation
[1:12:45] and a consolation and an acceptance that
[1:12:47] you died for our sins that our sins are
[1:12:49] forgiven to our young ladies and our
[1:12:51] young men Lord May the word of God abide
[1:12:54] in them may they be strong and may they
[1:12:56] overcome the wicked one Lord those of us
[1:12:59] who are in our adult time of life if
[1:13:01] we've had this experience may we remain
[1:13:02] true to it ever true to it knowing that
[1:13:06] what we received in the beginning of our
[1:13:08] walk even spiritually
[1:13:11] Lord how that as children it's by faith
[1:13:14] we believe by faith we are Justified
[1:13:16] it's by
[1:13:17] faith that you give us the confirmation
[1:13:20] of
[1:13:21] that justification and forgiveness by
[1:13:24] the holy GH ghost indwelling in
[1:13:26] us so that as we grow into young
[1:13:29] believers we're strong the word abides
[1:13:32] in us and we're overcoming the wicked
[1:13:35] one let us find Our Testimony
[1:13:38] Lord and Lord I pray for our young men
[1:13:41] and our young ladies The Temptations of
[1:13:43] the
[1:13:45] internet the images The
[1:13:49] Sounds the appeal to the Flesh in the
[1:13:53] most filthy ways Lord and even some of
[1:13:54] the most unassuming
[1:13:56] ways and Lord how that some of us walk
[1:13:59] through adolescence and youth in these
[1:14:01] things and it scarred us and
[1:14:05] it made mistakes and traveled down paths
[1:14:08] that we
[1:14:09] shouldn't so we find ourselves even in
[1:14:11] adulthood and sometimes marriage with
[1:14:13] great difficulties and
[1:14:15] struggles and Lord it just opens up a
[1:14:17] whole another level of hurts and things
[1:14:19] that get upside down and misconceptions
[1:14:22] and Lord it just sin is not a victimless
[1:14:26] crime
[1:14:28] unbelief is not a victimless
[1:14:32] offense but where we sin where we
[1:14:34] disbelieve where we're obstinate where
[1:14:35] we're stubborn where we yield to the big
[1:14:38] three we suffer as individuals as
[1:14:42] families as
[1:14:45] churches and Lord we'll find no other
[1:14:47] way to overcome whether it be our own
[1:14:49] Hurts by others or our offenses that
[1:14:51] we've done to others we'll never be able
[1:14:53] to make it in these other realms are
[1:14:55] through these other devices but only by
[1:14:57] you the one
[1:14:59] Christ I pray for us today Lord may this
[1:15:02] may we drive down a stake
[1:15:05] today and say
[1:15:07] Christ is my
[1:15:09] absolute and I don't want it to just be
[1:15:12] a name I don't want it just to be a
[1:15:14] number I don't want it to just be a
[1:15:15] proclamation I want to know you Lord I
[1:15:17] want it to be real I want to feel your
[1:15:20] presence I want to overcome
[1:15:22] Lord I do want to see victory I do want
[1:15:25] to see healings I want to see overcoming
[1:15:27] Lord but only thing I can do is come to
[1:15:30] you the heart that's open to say Lord
[1:15:32] forgive
[1:15:33] me receive me into you Lord wash me and
[1:15:36] make me clean and heal me Lord that I
[1:15:40] may serve you that I may overcome all
[1:15:43] that is in the world because I believe
[1:15:45] that you are come in the
[1:15:47] flesh to do great
[1:15:50] things I ask all this in the name of the
[1:15:53] Lord Jesus Christ amen man
