[0:03] I'd like to begin by reading a statement
[0:06] um from the church age book and I don't
[0:08] know if my title slide comes before this
[0:10] or after brother John but my title today
[0:13] is receiving the gift of Christ's
[0:16] presence receiving the gift of Christ's
[0:19] presence we took a couple Services
[0:20] looking at the gift of Christ's presence
[0:23] and Wednesday night bringing it to uh a
[0:25] real focus on his promise at the end
[0:27] time but now today we're just using this
[0:30] receiving the gift of Christ's presence
[0:33] I'd like to start with a statement from
[0:34] the church age book and it's I would
[0:36] encourage you to go find this reading I
[0:39] think it's maybe after the salutation
[0:41] now can't recall but it's in the church
[0:43] age book where brother brandham gives
[0:45] that uh pick up your pen and write and
[0:48] um and he kind of edits that and puts it
[0:50] there and kind of grammar ises a little
[0:52] bit from what he did I think it's in
[0:53] spoken words The Original Seed he puts
[0:55] that in um the church age book so in
[0:57] that area there if you read this the
[0:59] entire
[1:00] of that portion where brother's talking
[1:02] about um people with experience and what
[1:05] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is i'
[1:06] I've been inspired in this sermon in
[1:08] particular in that whole passage and
[1:11] this is so this statement here comes
[1:13] from there it says if you leave that
[1:14] word you have left God and that's just
[1:16] the maybe a thesis or a principle if you
[1:19] leave that word you have left God thus
[1:22] he is presenting himself to the church
[1:24] at pergamus and indeed to all churches
[1:27] of all ages and this is his presentation
[1:29] I am the word and so Christ expresses
[1:34] this if you want deity in your midst if
[1:36] you want God in your midst then welcome
[1:39] and receive the word again this is
[1:41] Christ presenting himself as he would uh
[1:44] we could say in every age if you want
[1:45] deity in your midst then welcome and
[1:47] receive the word don't let anyone or
[1:49] anything get between you and that word
[1:52] so there is uh Christ again his
[1:56] expression to all ages and presenting
[1:59] himself this is which I am giving you
[2:01] the word this which I am giving you the
[2:04] word is a revelation of myself I am the
[2:07] word remembered that so that's that's
[2:10] the presentation of Christ to the age
[2:13] he's presenting himself this is
[2:15] something he's wanting to give that if
[2:17] you have if you're going to have him you
[2:19] have to receive the word that's being
[2:20] presented to you and then brother
[2:23] brandham says I wonder if we are
[2:25] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[2:28] our midst so those are uh so very all
[2:32] these words Merit some attention and
[2:34] some real focus in there but I want to
[2:37] amplify hopefully at some point today if
[2:39] you want deity in your midst then
[2:40] welcome and receive the word so Christ
[2:42] is presenting himself we could even say
[2:45] he's in in his midst presenting himself
[2:47] but if you really want it you want want
[2:50] this uh presence you have to welcome it
[2:53] and receive it and so brother bradam
[2:55] based upon this presentation he says so
[2:57] I wonder if we are sufficiently
[2:59] impressed
[3:00] with the word in our midst to have deity
[3:02] if you want deity you have to do
[3:04] something so he's curious do we want it
[3:07] enough are we sufficiently impressed
[3:09] with it to have
[3:10] it and so that it's based upon these
[3:13] things that we're taking that receiving
[3:15] the gift of Christ's presence and using
[3:18] the the concept of the gift of his
[3:20] presence from the sermon the Queen of
[3:22] Sheba where brother man I said God gives
[3:24] gifts in all generations a gift of his
[3:26] presence and brother Bram says that God
[3:29] in every age has a gift um that declares
[3:31] his presence or presents that word to
[3:33] each age and to try to summarize a lot
[3:37] of different principles together as
[3:38] we're closing this series on the house
[3:40] of the Lord uh the house of the Lord to
[3:42] put it in this language declared God's
[3:44] presence in Israel it was his house it
[3:46] was his dwelling place and so God's
[3:49] presence was amongst Israel in his
[3:51] Temple or in his Tabernacle his Dwelling
[3:54] Place among his people and they would
[3:56] look to the temple say that's where God
[3:58] dwells this is how God is declaring his
[4:00] presence and then when in in Isaiah it
[4:03] was prophesied that a virgin shall
[4:05] conceive and bring forth a son and his
[4:08] name will be called Emanuel and in
[4:10] Matthew 1: 23 It quotes that scripture
[4:13] and says Behold a virgin shall be with
[4:15] child and shall bring forth a son and
[4:18] they shall call his name Emmanuel which
[4:20] being interpreted is god with us so
[4:24] Christ now is the temple has
[4:27] foreshadowed Christ as God was among
[4:29] amongst them in a tabernacle now Christ
[4:31] is going to be uh called Emmanuel not
[4:35] that his name would be Emanuel but he'd
[4:36] be called uh Emanuel in that he was God
[4:40] With Us I was reading here recently and
[4:43] it's interesting just how much Scholars
[4:45] and academics you know pouring through
[4:48] text and writings and historical records
[4:51] and there's a book out there and there's
[4:53] different writers who have done this
[4:54] before that say that the uh new in the
[4:57] New Testament the disciples invented a
[5:00] lot of explanations to kind of hide the
[5:03] reality and the truth that Jesus was
[5:05] illegitimate and lest they think that
[5:08] Jesus rotted in a tomb they told they
[5:10] told a story about a resurrection and
[5:12] they've just all concocted this so if
[5:15] your faith can be shaken we'll put out a
[5:17] website there so that you could read all
[5:18] these things a and begin to question and
[5:21] doubt oh Jesus was a fraud and all his
[5:23] disciples made this up um and so instead
[5:27] of it being rumors to try to tear down
[5:28] the truth of Christ it was inventions by
[5:31] disciples to obscure the reality that he
[5:34] was just an illegitimate child of a
[5:36] Roman soldier and because they found
[5:38] this name on a tombstone and they found
[5:41] this in the records They think there
[5:42] might be something to
[5:44] it but here we see a remarkable prophecy
[5:48] a virgin shall conceive will be with
[5:50] child and the child which is brought
[5:52] forth will be God With Us that's his
[5:54] meaning so Jesus Christ declared the
[5:57] presence of God to the Jews we see that
[6:00] remarkable transition at the cross when
[6:02] the veil is rent and God's presence is
[6:04] no longer in the temple but there on The
[6:06] Mercy Seat is Christ bleeding and is
[6:10] representing God's glory and God's Son
[6:12] and The Mercy Seat so Christ was the
[6:15] Temple of God's glory in John CH 2: 19-
[6:20] 21 you see this uh symmetry in scripture
[6:23] Jesus answered and said unto them
[6:25] destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will
[6:27] raise it up then said the Jews 40 in six
[6:30] years was this temple in building and
[6:31] wil thou rear it up in 3 days but he
[6:34] spake of the Temple of his body so
[6:37] Christ is making this connection that
[6:39] here he is a temple he is a temple of
[6:42] God he's the Temple of the father
[6:43] destroy this Temple and it'll be raised
[6:45] up again he's not speaking of the
[6:47] physical Temple but the Temple of his
[6:49] body so Christ himself positions him
[6:52] next to the temple and causes them to
[6:55] consider which one am I speaking of
[6:57] which one is the one that will be
[6:58] Resurrected and raised up in Hebrews
[7:01] chap 9:1 but Christ being come a high
[7:04] priest of good things to come by a
[7:06] greater and more perfect Tabernacle not
[7:09] made with hands that is to say not of
[7:11] this building so it's not the Tabernacle
[7:13] in the wilderness made of tents it's not
[7:15] the temple in Jerusalem Made of Stone
[7:18] and it's not even that little room that
[7:20] was uh behind the veil or behind Badger
[7:22] skins or that Solomon erected but it was
[7:24] Christ was that more perfect Tabernacle
[7:27] chapter 10:5 wherefore when he cometh
[7:29] into the world he sayith sacrifice and
[7:31] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[7:34] thou hast thou prepared me so Jesus
[7:37] Christ represented the dwelling place of
[7:39] God on Earth he is his house he is a
[7:41] tabernacle his body was a temple it was
[7:44] a body that was prepared that as the
[7:46] scripture says where is the place of my
[7:48] rest it was reflected in God the
[7:51] fullness of God dwelling in his son as
[7:54] the shakina glory would have come down
[7:56] and dwelt behind Badger skins between
[7:58] those cherums now now he's in flesh the
[8:01] Bible says in John 1:14 and the Word was
[8:04] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[8:07] beheld his glory the glory is of the
[8:10] only begotten of the father full of
[8:12] grace and truth as we've covered that
[8:14] quite a bit brings us right to The Mercy
[8:16] Seat where truth and mercy are met
[8:19] together there is the grace of God the
[8:20] word which was God is made flesh in
[8:24] Jesus Christ the word which was before
[8:28] time which is in those preceding verses
[8:31] before verse 14 is quite a recitation
[8:35] and because brother Bram says in the
[8:36] beginning was the word and the Word was
[8:38] with God and the Word was God and the
[8:39] Word was made flesh if you don't ever
[8:41] read your Bible you think that would all
[8:42] be verse one and then I remember brother
[8:45] sharing with me one time he was in a
[8:47] hotel hunting uh with some brothers and
[8:49] he grabbed the Gideon Bible and he
[8:51] opened to John chapter 1 he began to
[8:53] read and after he finished verse one he
[8:54] saids there's a misprint in the Bible
[8:57] like what what what is it he goes it
[8:58] doesn't say the word was made flesh it's
[9:00] like we'll keep reading verse 14 the
[9:03] word was made flesh amen that word which
[9:06] was God Before Time Was Made flesh in
[9:08] his son Jesus Christ is became the very
[9:11] manifestation in the full revelation of
[9:13] God and we could say though God was
[9:17] manifested in flesh we even see Philip
[9:21] saying show us the father and it'll
[9:22] suffice us and he says have I been with
[9:24] you so long and you don't know who I am
[9:25] when you've seen me you've seen the
[9:27] father so though it can be the full
[9:29] expression of the word it can still be a
[9:32] secret despite the manifestation it can
[9:34] still be a secret which comes to the
[9:37] promise in this hour when the full
[9:38] revelation of Jesus Christ is to be born
[9:40] into manifestation again in full
[9:43] strength in full measure in the bride
[9:45] and how there can be a secret of his
[9:47] presence a tabernacle a dwelling and a
[9:50] safety in this hour and Pro in his word
[9:53] brother BR said we know that there's a
[9:55] messiah coming and when that Messiah
[9:58] comes he's going to to be the word we
[10:01] had a promise of the gift of Christ's
[10:03] presence in this hour does that mean
[10:05] we're in the Millennium now no does that
[10:07] mean there's no meeting there no there's
[10:09] things that are going to happen but you
[10:11] have to recognize your day and its
[10:15] message and why it had to be Shepherd
[10:17] which I pull in a lot from today he says
[10:19] Christ is the word the anointed word
[10:21] made
[10:22] manifest and if there's any Open Hearts
[10:25] here tonight that don't have that
[10:26] Messiah the real Christmas gift the only
[10:30] real Christmas gift there is that God
[10:32] gave the world and declared it to the
[10:34] World by Shepherds of his lamb the
[10:36] atonement for sin and if that heart is
[10:39] open tonight place in it the Lord the
[10:42] Messiah word of today the Messiah word
[10:46] of today I think he uses a deliberate
[10:48] language Feast of the trumpets he said
[10:51] and how he reveals himself so that we
[10:53] could know our mate the revealed
[10:56] word he says there's uh if he's open up
[10:59] your heart I just like to Echo the words
[11:01] of the that choir make room in your
[11:03] heart says we receive your Christmas
[11:06] gift the Messiah the anointed word that
[11:09] vindicates your presence with us it is
[11:12] the anointed word that vindicates his
[11:15] presence with us we can say Jesus Christ
[11:17] is the Living Word that makes God
[11:20] present that's how we know who Jesus
[11:22] Christ is because Jesus said before
[11:24] Abraham was I am how is it Christ is the
[11:28] Living Word that makes God present how
[11:30] is it that Paul could say have I not
[11:32] seen Jesus Christ my Lord so he's before
[11:35] Christ on Earth and he's after Christ
[11:38] has ascended into heaven how could he
[11:39] say it because Christ is the Living Word
[11:42] that vindicates God's presence or makes
[11:45] God present with us in Psalms 27:4 as we
[11:49] move on I just wanted to share those
[11:51] things God took me a little bit
[11:52] different direction than where we were
[11:54] trending on Wednesday night those are
[11:56] just a few statements uh to consider and
[11:59] Ponder on the Lord revealing himself in
[12:02] this hour and in Psalms 27:4 this has
[12:05] been a key scripture for me as we've
[12:07] studied on the house of the Lord we
[12:09] begin with this in part one on one thing
[12:12] have I desired of the Lord one thing
[12:14] desired David says one thing have I
[12:17] desired of the Lord this was in the time
[12:18] of trouble this is when his enemies were
[12:20] compassed about him to eat up his flesh
[12:22] so with one thing desired he said that
[12:24] one thing will I seek after and here he
[12:26] begins to describe it that I may dwell
[12:29] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[12:31] my life now his language begins to
[12:33] become uh uh synonymous with the very
[12:37] words of God who said I will dwell
[12:39] between the cheram this is going to be
[12:40] my Dwelling Place among Israel and now
[12:43] David doesn't want to say I was glad
[12:44] when they said unto me let us go unto
[12:46] the house of the Lord he wants to dwell
[12:48] and in the same place that God
[12:51] dwelt to dwell in the house of the Lord
[12:54] all the days of my life to behold the
[12:56] beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his
[12:58] Temple here's the one aim here's the one
[13:01] desire God's presence he did not want to
[13:04] live as we mentioned Wednesday night I
[13:05] think it was in a verbo or an Airbnb
[13:07] where the host has left and like and
[13:10] nowadays they have uh some offerings
[13:12] where it's like you can go stay in this
[13:14] famous place where this person stayed or
[13:16] this is so and so's house that's been
[13:18] designed it's their place I even think
[13:20] the uh owner of Airbnb the CEO puts up
[13:23] his place to stay in and so you could
[13:25] stay in there and say wow we're staying
[13:27] in this guy's house but but he's not
[13:30] there right so you're you're not really
[13:33] the kind of guest that he wants to be
[13:34] around but he'll let you use his place
[13:36] for some
[13:37] gas and so it it here he's not wanting
[13:40] just to go to church and and the spirit
[13:43] of the Lord not be there he doesn't want
[13:44] to just go to the house of the Lord and
[13:46] God has vacated it and move somewhere
[13:48] else if God had abandoned that Temple
[13:50] and then went to dwell somewhere else
[13:52] David wouldn't have wanted to be in
[13:53] Solomon's Temple he wouldn't have wanted
[13:55] to be in that Tabernacle he said well
[13:56] tell me where he is that's where I want
[13:58] to be
[13:59] amen so he longed to look into his face
[14:02] because if he's looking in his face
[14:04] that's that's him that's his presence he
[14:07] wanted to and I I I I just feel like
[14:09] there's a there's a language that we
[14:11] could use and try to develop through
[14:14] scripture and statements from the
[14:15] messenger of the hour but if I could say
[14:17] it this way he just wanted to know more
[14:20] deeply a and to be fully known and to
[14:22] fully know him Paul expresses this
[14:25] desire in the New Testament I believe it
[14:27] just marries so beautifully with David
[14:28] saying I've desired this one thing Paul
[14:30] said I I'm determined to know nothing
[14:32] else but Christ I count everything else
[14:35] as dunk but I want to know Christ David
[14:37] one thing have I desired I'll seek after
[14:39] it so uh the a longing a desire
[14:42] something you're seeking I want you to
[14:44] think of this it's not one thing I
[14:46] know God is real but one thing I
[14:50] desired it's not one thing I feel so
[14:53] it's not a um a binary proposition in
[14:56] terms of well you either believe him or
[14:58] you don't or you feel them or you don't
[15:00] but it's one thing
[15:02] desired I desire I long and Paul says in
[15:04] 1 Corinthians 13:12 for now we see
[15:07] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[15:10] face and this face to face is what David
[15:13] was Desiring something that God said man
[15:15] could not do and survive he says I I
[15:17] want to see him Face to Face Paul says
[15:19] then we will see him face to face for
[15:21] now I know in part but then shall I know
[15:24] even as also I am known I will know as I
[15:28] am known I am fully known by him and I
[15:30] am possessed by him but I want to I want
[15:32] to know him it's expressed this way in
[15:35] Philippians 3:12 to 14 he says not as
[15:38] though I have already attained either
[15:40] were already perfect notice how closely
[15:42] this fits with 13:12 of 1 Corinthians
[15:44] then I shall know as I am known so he
[15:47] says I I don't speak as one who's
[15:49] obtained but I follow after I desire
[15:52] amen if that I may apprehend that for
[15:56] which also I am apprehended of Christ
[15:58] Jesus
[16:00] I I pursue I desire that I may apprehend
[16:03] Christ as I am apprehended by Christ am
[16:08] even then shall I know as I am already
[16:10] known I am already known but I want to
[16:12] know you the same way I want to
[16:15] apprehend you you've seized me you
[16:16] possessed me I want to possess you
[16:18] Brethren I count not myself to have
[16:20] apprehended but this one thing I do this
[16:23] one thing I desire that I may dwell in
[16:25] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[16:27] life to behold the beauty of the Lord to
[16:28] inquire in his Temple to have an
[16:31] arrangement of Union and intimacy that's
[16:33] permanent and abiding amen amen but one
[16:36] thing I do I forget those things which
[16:38] are behind and reach forth into those
[16:41] things which are before forgetting and
[16:44] reaching forth I press toward the mark
[16:46] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[16:49] in Christ
[16:51] Jesus my title being receiving the gift
[16:55] of Christ's presence I I'm wanting to
[16:58] convey something something to you today
[16:59] that would be of benefit and use to us
[17:02] so let me say this is not merely
[17:05] conviction but this is true faith that
[17:09] exhibited by this Zeal for
[17:12] Christ I Paul having met Christ is not
[17:17] satisfied to Simply tell of his
[17:21] experience having been struck down by
[17:23] the pillar of fire and experienced many
[17:25] miracles he he's not willing just to
[17:27] become uh to recite history and to talk
[17:30] of what he is experiencing that he has
[17:32] some sort of conviction that Christ is
[17:35] real and he's true but Paul rather had a
[17:38] a a zealousness to know him to reach
[17:40] forth and to press he says I desire to
[17:44] be seized by him as he has seized
[17:47] me so it is more than
[17:50] emotion I I find myself I'm a very
[17:53] proponent of the word only and that we
[17:55] are told to only believe so I I I want
[17:59] to use air
[18:01] quotes uh to convey this but it's not
[18:04] just an emotion or
[18:06] belief where there's an intellectual
[18:09] acceptance of something but it's a
[18:11] desire for the word of life aing for his
[18:15] presence a hunger for his presence more
[18:18] than just a belief or
[18:21] emotion if we could say it this way his
[18:23] presence is a
[18:25] longing it it it creates something it it
[18:28] causes
[18:29] something I believe some of the early
[18:32] church writers and I maybe was going to
[18:34] touch on this next Sunday expressed
[18:37] Heaven as a Perpetual
[18:39] longing that it's not just a fixed place
[18:42] that we're going to remember we're
[18:44] talking about heaven on Earth and a home
[18:46] for heaven and those things it's
[18:48] something that we can have
[18:51] now now this is where I think we can
[18:53] transition to some very though it's
[18:55] going to be principle based I think
[18:57] there's some practical things that you
[18:59] could take from this in the absence of a
[19:02] physical Temple wherein David said one
[19:03] thing have I desired and that will I
[19:05] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[19:07] of the Lord and we could say there was a
[19:08] fixed address that David is thinking of
[19:11] in the absence of a physical Temple or
[19:13] Tabernacle what does seeking his face
[19:16] look
[19:17] like what does it what would it mean to
[19:20] pursue his
[19:22] presence and I want to use the example
[19:24] of the Jews when they were exiled from
[19:26] Jerusalem in Babylonian captivity and
[19:28] there was was this dispora even in the
[19:30] Old Testament and when they were exiled
[19:34] from Jerusalem and the temple is being
[19:36] torn and it's in Ruins they established
[19:38] places of prayer and
[19:40] study and these would be called we know
[19:42] as synagogues and it' be the Bess
[19:46] knesset where they would uh s these
[19:50] synagogues where they would gather for
[19:51] the very purpose of called The House of
[19:53] Assembly it's what the Hebrew word means
[19:55] and it' be a place where they gather
[19:57] around their written words the Torah to
[20:00] read and to pray the word of God and
[20:03] pray to God not being able to go to the
[20:05] temple they get they made houses of
[20:07] dwelling houses of assembly now this is
[20:10] an excellent example for even our
[20:14] churches watch how this works in terms
[20:17] of where we are today where they had a
[20:19] physical Temple which would have been
[20:20] the ultimate we could say for us maybe
[20:22] the ultimate is the New Jerusalem or the
[20:24] ultimate is Christ himself when we meet
[20:26] him in the air but in the meantime while
[20:28] we're still here exiled from our the the
[20:31] restoration of everything and the New
[20:33] Jerusalem uh we have synagogues or
[20:35] places of worship that are for the
[20:37] purpose of assembling ourselves
[20:39] together and in Luke 4: 14 15 and
[20:43] 16 this is after his baptism he's now
[20:47] going in the power of the Holy Spirit
[20:49] and Jesus returned in the power of the
[20:50] spirit into Galilee and there went out
[20:52] of Fame of him through all the region
[20:54] round about and he taught in their
[20:56] synagogues their house of assembly being
[20:59] glorified of all and he came to Nazareth
[21:02] where he had been brought up and as his
[21:05] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[21:08] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[21:11] Christ is coming to the House of
[21:14] Assembly he's coming to the place where
[21:16] the Jews had established these in the
[21:18] absence of one Gathering Place in the
[21:20] temple they had established these
[21:22] different places of prayer and study so
[21:24] he comes to the synagogue and the Very
[21:27] image of this is so beautiful here are
[21:29] these places where they would come
[21:31] together to pray to God and study his
[21:33] word and pray for the Messiah and learn
[21:35] of the Messiah and God's prophecies and
[21:37] the restoration of Jerusalem and the
[21:38] restoration of the temple and the one
[21:41] whom the temple pointed to comes into
[21:44] their very church service their House of
[21:46] Assembly and stands up and begins to
[21:49] open up their word and read to them can
[21:52] you just imagine what scene uh was being
[21:55] rehearsed before them no wonder he said
[21:58] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[22:01] your
[22:02] ears he's coming to the very place where
[22:06] these things were meditated on and
[22:08] prayed about and looked forward to much
[22:10] like our churches
[22:15] today in Luke 4:
[22:20] 31-36 same chapter and you you'll find
[22:23] in here uh other portions that relate to
[22:26] this and he came down to capern a city
[22:29] of Galilee and taught them on the
[22:31] Sabbath days we know that it's his
[22:32] custom to go to the synagogue he's going
[22:35] to be teaching them and it says and they
[22:36] were astonished at his Doctrine for his
[22:39] word was with
[22:41] power it what does it mean it was with
[22:44] power how how did they know it had power
[22:46] so it gives the very next verse and in
[22:48] the synagogue there was a a man so he's
[22:50] in the House of
[22:52] Assembly they had the house of the Lord
[22:55] where God dwelt but now God has come to
[22:57] their house of
[22:59] assembly their Church their synagogue
[23:01] their house of prayer and study and he's
[23:05] teaching the very word of God and then
[23:07] synagogue was a man who had a spirit of
[23:08] an unclean devil and cried out with a
[23:10] loud voice this is the effect of the
[23:13] word saying let us alone what have we to
[23:15] do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth Art
[23:18] Thou come to destroy us I Know Thee who
[23:21] Thou Art the Holy One of God and Jesus
[23:24] rebuked him saying hold thy peace and
[23:26] come out of him what exposed it the word
[23:29] taught what cast it out the word and the
[23:33] devil had thrown him in the midst and he
[23:35] came out of him and hurt him not this is
[23:37] where they saw that his teaching his
[23:39] Doctrine the words that proceeded from
[23:40] his mouth had power in them Jesus did
[23:43] kick them and punch them and anoint him
[23:45] with oil it was the word that had this
[23:47] effect and they were all amazed and
[23:50] spake among themselves saying what a
[23:51] word is this for with authority and
[23:54] power he commanded the unclean spirits
[23:56] and they come out I believe we could
[23:59] point to this to recognize why brother
[24:01] bradam said Jesus emphasized the word
[24:03] more than his Works said well he said if
[24:05] you don't believe me for my word's sake
[24:07] believe me for my works but what was it
[24:09] he spoke first the word Jesus didn't
[24:11] walk into the synagogue that day kick
[24:13] open the door said form a prayer line on
[24:15] the right give me some oil and
[24:17] immediately begin to do things he just
[24:19] began to teach the word and bringing
[24:21] forth the word the word had pow demons
[24:24] can be cast out while the word is being
[24:26] preached God's original way for you to
[24:29] receive him is through the
[24:32] word so he emphasized word and then the
[24:35] Miracles followed because Miracles
[24:38] follow Miracles come with it
[24:39] Supernatural healing Deliverance raising
[24:41] of the Dead all sorts of things come
[24:43] first but the emphasis in the order has
[24:45] to be on the
[24:47] word Luke 5:1 17 and it came to pass in
[24:51] a certain day as he was teaching that
[24:53] there were Pharisees and doctors of the
[24:55] law sitting by which were come out of
[24:56] every town of Galilee and Judea in
[24:58] Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was
[25:02] present to heal them simply where he was
[25:05] teaching where was he teaching in the
[25:08] synagogue so in the absence of a of the
[25:11] temple in the absence of a common place
[25:15] there were synagogues and houses of
[25:16] worship and these places of prayer and
[25:18] study where Christ would visit and make
[25:21] himself
[25:22] known and his power would be made
[25:25] manifest through the word of God and he
[25:26] was there present to to heal them and to
[25:29] deliver
[25:31] them after the destruction of the
[25:36] temple in the New Testament or going
[25:38] forward by
[25:39] Titus the Jews begin to establish houses
[25:42] of
[25:46] study the the how's I think we call them
[25:49] bait
[25:50] midrash bait midrash is it looks like
[25:52] two different words butai in the plural
[25:55] and they houses of seeking
[25:59] they had a place where they would come
[26:01] together and they were called houses of
[26:04] seeking not just a place of prayer not
[26:08] just a place of gathering but a place of
[26:11] seeking where they would look into the
[26:13] Torah they're they're very remarkable
[26:16] things and I've seen some videos on them
[26:17] in the past where they're they're just
[26:19] reading through the word they're
[26:20] reciting scripture but it was a the the
[26:22] the Gen in the Genesis the desire was to
[26:24] look into the Torah and learn about
[26:26] God and the debate uh the word there
[26:30] that's used we get betel and house from
[26:33] it this house of seeking it's used to
[26:35] emphasize the importance of seeking
[26:37] knowledge of God and learning more about
[26:39] God and having understanding of his word
[26:41] reflects the value that's placed upon
[26:43] seeking more knowledge more
[26:45] understanding this continuous learning
[26:47] and Revelation and spiritual
[26:50] growth and that was how they looked to
[26:52] their Torah but we can look to the word
[26:54] of God both both Old and New Testament
[26:56] and say that in this word Christ is
[26:58] making himself real and Christ has
[27:00] revealed himself and Christ is in every
[27:02] verse and so we pray to God and we call
[27:04] upon God for revelation of his word more
[27:06] than
[27:07] anything the sermon Pride brother Bram
[27:09] says scriptures all tied together how
[27:12] the how the Bible means so much more
[27:15] than it speaks if we can only have the
[27:17] Holy Spirit to interpret it for us we
[27:20] only read it as we look down upon it but
[27:21] oh how the holy spirit says child of
[27:24] mine you are looking into my face now
[27:27] when you look into this Bible this is
[27:28] what I want you to
[27:30] know when you look into the Bible you
[27:33] see my face and may the Holy Spirit take
[27:35] the word of God today and deliver it to
[27:36] every heart just as that we have need
[27:39] God is able to again through his word
[27:41] give us what we have need of God is able
[27:43] to through the word bring a power
[27:45] present to heal all of us to deliver us
[27:48] to make himself
[27:49] known and just as Christ came to the
[27:53] synagogue and he began to read and open
[27:55] himself up come to the these houses of
[27:59] seeking Christ is revealed in the same
[28:04] today through his
[28:07] word and so the statement that we want
[28:09] to pull from now for a moment to use
[28:12] this example of Christ coming to the
[28:15] houses of assembly the houses of seeking
[28:18] there has to be an assemblage there has
[28:19] to be a seeking or even if it's not so
[28:21] much in the assemblage but it's that
[28:23] desire to know as Paul said I I want to
[28:26] know David said said one thing I
[28:31] desired if you want deity in your midst
[28:34] notice how brother says this if you want
[28:35] deity in your midst then welcome and
[28:39] receive the
[28:41] word though the Jews could say well we
[28:43] have the temple and God could have said
[28:46] well you have the temple I'm just going
[28:48] to have my son come and he's going to
[28:49] die but he came and he manifested
[28:51] himself he revealed himself he came to
[28:54] their houses of worship and their places
[28:56] of assembly and their place of gathering
[28:59] and
[29:00] seeking they could have said well I'm a
[29:02] Jew and a Jew the Messiah will come and
[29:04] you'll restore the kingdom and
[29:05] everything will be well could have just
[29:07] merely believed it but they didn't just
[29:09] believe it they poured into it they
[29:10] sought it out they looked into it they
[29:12] wanted to learn they taught it they were
[29:14] told in the Old Testament teach these
[29:15] things to your children not just believe
[29:17] them and tell your children you believe
[29:19] them so he said if you want God if you
[29:21] want deity if you want Christ's presence
[29:23] in your midst then welcome and receive
[29:25] the word am it's not just to believe or
[29:30] acknowledge it's more than just an
[29:35] invitation we maybe even ask well what
[29:37] does it mean to welcome and receive the
[29:39] word or how could what does it mean to
[29:41] recognize and receive his presence what
[29:42] would that look
[29:44] like I want to use the example of Luke
[29:47] 7:36 and just read this one verse and
[29:49] then skip to verse
[29:51] 44 and if you to go back and read I was
[29:55] going to maybe use this as our text uh
[29:57] just to kind of put the story in our
[29:58] mind but in Luke 7:36 and one of the
[30:02] Pharisees desired him that he would eat
[30:05] with him and he went into the Pharisees
[30:07] house and sat down to meet now I want
[30:10] you to gather in your mind how Simon
[30:14] believe this is Simon who desired him to
[30:17] come Simon the Pharisee and he says I
[30:20] want you to come eat with me I want you
[30:24] to come to my house this is an
[30:25] invitation to Su this is a invitation to
[30:28] feast and to a meal and brother bam says
[30:30] Jesus goes everywhere he's invited and
[30:33] so Christ will come by invitation and
[30:35] one of the Pharisees desired that he
[30:37] would eat with him and he went into the
[30:39] Pharisees house and sat down to
[30:42] meet now if we could lean into this a
[30:44] little bit and recognize that the
[30:46] Pharisee invited Christ Christ comes to
[30:50] the house just as he would have been in
[30:52] the house of seeking or in the House of
[30:54] Prayer or in the house of gathering the
[30:56] houses of assembly he would come and now
[30:59] as he has been invited he comes into the
[31:01] house and he sits down to
[31:03] eat but in verse 44 we find out that
[31:06] having been invited having arrived and
[31:09] been present with them that something
[31:11] different is happening there's more
[31:13] layers to this in verse 44 and he turned
[31:16] to the woman and said unto Simon because
[31:18] this woman is is performing a service to
[31:21] Christ and they're all murmuring and
[31:23] mocking and I know I'm skipping a lot
[31:25] here but he says seest Thou this woman
[31:28] I entered into thine house by
[31:31] invitation thou gavest me no water for
[31:34] my feet amen but she has washed my feet
[31:37] with tears and wiped them with the hairs
[31:38] of her head thou gavest me no kiss but
[31:42] this woman since the time I came in hath
[31:44] not ceased to K kiss my feet my head
[31:47] with oil thou didst not anoint but this
[31:50] woman hath anointed my feet with
[31:53] ointment we can look at this scene and
[31:55] take away from it well what does it mean
[31:57] for me to recognize the presence of
[31:59] Christ in this it today and how is it
[32:01] that I can welcome and receive the word
[32:04] in my day here we can see where the
[32:06] Pharisee had invited Christ to his house
[32:09] Christ had indeed come in the he sat the
[32:11] Bible says he sat down to meet to eat
[32:14] the Pharisees served
[32:16] dinner but he didn't wash his feet he
[32:20] didn't greet him with a kiss he didn't
[32:21] anoint him with oil he didn't refresh
[32:23] him he didn't give attention to him he
[32:25] didn't care for him
[32:28] let me just say this during this holiday
[32:29] time when maybe we invite people over
[32:31] and maybe we can just think about this
[32:33] in our past experience serving a meal to
[32:35] visitors is vastly different in
[32:37] receiving a guest corre you could serve
[32:40] a
[32:41] meal and you could arrive at someone's
[32:44] home and it's merely just a meal that's
[32:45] being served and you're really just
[32:46] there to eat you're kind well this is
[32:48] weird you know kind of showed up it's
[32:50] like well the food's over here and
[32:51] somebody pray and it just kind of you
[32:52] come and you eat and it's kind of like
[32:54] all right we're all done here and you're
[32:55] like all right well see you later hope
[32:57] the cook was
[32:58] good different in how you would have
[33:01] somebody over merely to serve them a
[33:03] meal or receiving them as a
[33:06] guest an invitation is a passive
[33:10] act to a guest come and I some of the
[33:12] sisters
[33:13] saying you know what it means to have a
[33:16] good because you just don't treat them
[33:17] like they did like a Wallflower but just
[33:20] telling someone to come is really a
[33:22] passive act because they say come to my
[33:24] house for dinner you're going to be
[33:25] cooking dinner yes there's something to
[33:27] that but just inviting them over for
[33:29] dinner the meal's going to be there it's
[33:31] a passive act but welcoming and
[33:33] receiving is different inviting and
[33:36] putting on a spread or giving an
[33:37] opportunity is one thing but welcoming
[33:39] and receiving is
[33:42] different just as Christ came to the
[33:44] Pharisees home and Simon let Christ
[33:47] enter and sit down to eat and he's
[33:48] serving him a meal and then there's a
[33:50] bunch of rumors and whispering and
[33:51] gossiping about him he says I entered
[33:54] I'm eating but you didn't wash my feet
[33:55] you didn't kiss me or greet me you
[33:57] didn't my feet with oil that is the
[33:59] hospitality that's receiving that's
[34:01] greeting and and welcoming
[34:05] someone in Acts chap
[34:08] 28:7 just going to be focusing on the
[34:10] last phrase of this verse and the same
[34:11] quarters were possessions of the chief
[34:13] man of the island whose name was puus
[34:16] who received us and lodged us three days
[34:21] courteously to re
[34:24] receive means to to it accept or to
[34:28] receive the word used there receive
[34:30] means to receive and hold one's
[34:33] attention to be kind to one who has come
[34:36] it's a very specific word uh to receive
[34:38] and to entertain is even maybe how it
[34:40] might be described you received us and
[34:43] then lodged us courtly for three
[34:45] days this type of reception requires a a
[34:49] deliberate recognition and welcoming of
[34:52] one where it wasn't just well you know
[34:55] just tell them that there's room in the
[34:56] end or just tell them they can go sleep
[34:57] in the barn or just tell them there's a
[34:58] guest room down the hall but the very
[35:01] one who was a chief man greeted them
[35:04] acknowledged them recognized them gave
[35:07] them lodging and and the he they whether
[35:10] you he held their attention or was
[35:12] attentive to
[35:14] them and therefore our welcoming and
[35:16] receiving the word requires a deliberate
[35:18] recognition of and a welcoming of the
[35:21] word amen they received us as we
[35:26] lodged in Luke Chap 10:
[35:30] 38-42 and now it came to pass as they
[35:32] went speaking of Christ and he entered
[35:34] into a certain Village and a certain
[35:37] woman named Martha received him into her
[35:41] house here is another example of
[35:44] receiving one but what's interesting is
[35:45] Acts chapter 28 uses a word that means
[35:47] to receive and hold one's attention here
[35:50] of Martha it just means to take in a
[35:53] guest very different word from the
[35:55] receive and hold one's attention the
[35:57] deomi means to receive and to be hold
[36:00] attention here it just means she took
[36:02] him in as a
[36:04] guest this is what Martha did invited
[36:07] them I'm serving dinner come and she had
[36:10] a sister called Mary which also sat at
[36:13] Jesus feet and heard his
[36:16] word talking about welcoming and
[36:18] receiving this isn't just Gathering it's
[36:20] not just acknowledging it's not just
[36:22] believing it's certainly not just
[36:23] emotion H but and again I use those
[36:26] things uh
[36:28] a as Polar Opposites to try to get your
[36:30] attention to some things yes the emotion
[36:32] goes with it yes believe only but
[36:34] there's wanting you to recognize
[36:36] something deeper here he says she sat at
[36:38] Jesus's feet to hear his word but Martha
[36:40] was cumbered about much
[36:43] serving she received him as a guest
[36:46] she's focused on the mill and came to
[36:49] him said Lord Dost thou not care that my
[36:51] sister left me to serve
[36:53] alone bid her therefore that she help me
[36:57] and Jesus answered and said unto her
[36:59] Martha Martha Thou Art careful and
[37:02] troubled about many
[37:04] things but one thing is needful one
[37:08] thing is desired what this thing will I
[37:11] do that will I seek after and Mary hath
[37:14] chosen that good part which shall not be
[37:17] taken away from her and a house in which
[37:20] Christ has come as a guest on
[37:24] invitation as Paul was received and and
[37:28] his attention was held and one we have
[37:31] to welcome and receive the word in our
[37:34] midst Martha had taken in a guest and
[37:37] then was busy about a lot of serving but
[37:39] Mary had received him differently she
[37:44] had welcomed him she had given him some
[37:48] attention to show that your presence
[37:50] here is important this isn't all about
[37:52] the pretense of me being able to cook a
[37:54] good meal this isn't all about me trying
[37:56] to impress you but your presence with me
[37:58] is important that that you have
[38:01] something I wantan to I want to be near
[38:02] you I want to see your face I want to
[38:03] hear your stories I want to hear about
[38:05] your
[38:06] travels I'm reminded of when I was in
[38:09] Uganda the first time or the only time
[38:11] the last time and 204 and I'd preached
[38:14] in several places and went to one place
[38:16] drove several hours and usually you'd
[38:18] show up and get thrown right behind the
[38:19] pulpit preach a few times and go back to
[38:21] your hotel several hours away I remember
[38:23] I arrived at this one place and the
[38:24] pastor invited us into his living room
[38:26] and got us the the best bananas you've
[38:28] ever tasted in your life these small
[38:30] sweet bananas the best come from Africa
[38:33] it sounded like a
[38:34] trumpism and there there is a he sat us
[38:38] down he got us refreshed in fruit and he
[38:40] sat down he just want us to relax take
[38:41] some time and he says so Brothers he
[38:43] didn't have his hand like what kind of
[38:45] offering are you bring he said tell me
[38:46] what you've been ministering in the
[38:47] country and fell and he was like we were
[38:51] valued our presence it wasn't just use
[38:53] us for a service or something but it was
[38:55] receiving us
[38:57] and Martha this may be seem to be kind
[38:59] of some strong language but I want to
[39:01] draw a comparison to Luke chapter 7
[39:03] Martha received Christ much like the
[39:04] Pharisees
[39:07] did he had him over for a meal and he's
[39:09] probably busy with different host duties
[39:11] and doing different things but Christ
[39:12] sat there as a wallf flower Martha
[39:15] received Christ like the Pharisee did
[39:17] but Mary received him like the woman in
[39:19] Luke chapter
[39:21] 7 CU When Christ
[39:23] entered the Bible tells us she washed
[39:26] his feet with her tee tears she dried
[39:29] his feet with her hair she kissed his
[39:31] feet and anointed them with
[39:34] oil there's a difference between serving
[39:37] and
[39:38] Hospitality there's a difference between
[39:40] inviting and receiving and welcoming
[39:42] there's a difference in saying well
[39:43] we've invited him he's
[39:45] here is't that enough his name's on the
[39:49] building whatever it might be however
[39:50] you might want to try to justify we're
[39:51] message Believers we got a picture of
[39:53] the cloud we got the Hoffman's head of
[39:54] Christ in the Foy all the different
[39:56] Optics and things that we could say we
[39:58] believe the message we press play and
[40:00] Obey we could have a lot of different
[40:01] Manas we might want to use but Martha
[40:04] had having invited him prepared and
[40:06] labored only but Mary welcomed the
[40:10] word she she gave vent to her
[40:13] inspiration she poured herself out to
[40:15] serve him she gave of her all to him and
[40:18] and she's sitting at his feet listening
[40:20] to the word
[40:22] amen in Romans 12: 10-13
[40:27] as Paul is admonishing the believer to
[40:29] be this way towards one another ought
[40:31] not there be a spiritual application to
[40:34] us towards
[40:35] Christ be kindly affectioned one to
[40:38] another with Brotherly Love in honor
[40:40] preferring one another not slothful in
[40:42] business he said don't be lazy but be
[40:45] fervent in spirit not sloin business
[40:48] fervent in spirit serving the lord
[40:50] rejoicing in Hope patient and
[40:51] tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[40:53] Distributing to the necessity of saints
[40:55] given to hospital
[40:58] Hospitality this word given to
[41:00] hospitality is the generosity that is
[41:01] shown to guests the kindness that is
[41:03] given to guests not merely having guests
[41:06] not merely having people over but rather
[41:08] given to as the Bible says in Titus and
[41:11] Timothy about way how a bishop should be
[41:13] given to hospitality or a lover of
[41:16] hospitality other words it's something
[41:18] that is special where they can show
[41:20] themselves kind they show themselves
[41:22] welcoming I'm sure we've all experienced
[41:24] it where we've been invited somewhere
[41:26] but we didn't feel welcomed
[41:28] uh there's there's been times where
[41:30] maybe you've been invited and you're
[41:31] clearly invited but you know you're not
[41:33] welcome so you don't go and you get
[41:34] criticized for not going you I was
[41:37] invited but was I really welcome was I
[41:40] really going to be at home is it really
[41:41] a place where I felt that I would be
[41:43] treated properly that I I would be
[41:45] acknowledged or refreshed or or
[41:47] [Applause]
[41:48] served he says we ought to be fervent in
[41:50] spirit serving the lord this is how the
[41:52] believer ought to be towards the word
[41:53] not slothful but F fervent in spirit a
[41:56] kind affection C towards the word
[41:58] preferring the
[42:01] word given to
[42:04] hospitality means loving to
[42:07] entertain the word entertain means to
[42:10] hold
[42:12] together you say well where where's
[42:14] what's the etymology on that there's
[42:17] that's what what happens when you're
[42:18] entertained it holds your
[42:21] attention the believer ought to be
[42:25] entertained by the word
[42:28] but then there's this concept that if we
[42:29] are going to be hospitable to welcome
[42:31] and receive the word then there's this
[42:34] holding together in a support of
[42:37] it if you want Christ in your midst
[42:40] welcome and receive the word there's a
[42:43] pattern that we can go through in the
[42:45] scripture to see that it's more than
[42:46] just I believe it it's more than just
[42:49] the Em going through the
[42:50] emotions in 1 Peter chap 4: 7 to10 I'm
[42:55] running out of time so I won't give this
[42:56] as much time in detail as perhaps I
[42:59] would have liked to but you'll see how
[43:01] beautifully it fits with Romans 12 not
[43:03] being lazy but fervent and spirit and
[43:05] given to
[43:07] hospitality Peter says but the end of
[43:09] all things is at hand and if there is a
[43:10] generation that could say this with
[43:13] absolute shity it's
[43:15] us be therefore sober and watch unto
[43:19] prayer and above all things have fervent
[43:21] charity among yourselves for charity
[43:24] shall cover the multitude of sins these
[43:26] are beautiful beautiful words of
[43:28] encouragement use Hospitality one to
[43:30] another without
[43:32] grudging this kindness this receiving
[43:35] this welcoming this attentiveness to
[43:37] without bitterness without grudging well
[43:41] I invited them over and they never
[43:42] invited me back that's
[43:44] grudging but you do it to show some sort
[43:47] of value some sort of worth if you ever
[43:49] inviting somebody over to your house
[43:51] just so that you would get an invitation
[43:53] back God most likely is just going to
[43:55] cause that Veil to drop down in that
[43:57] person's mind so that they don't do it
[44:00] like I wonder why they never invited me
[44:01] back and if you ever ask they'd be like
[44:04] I never even thought of that what does
[44:05] that even mean right because God just
[44:06] comes wipes that part of their mind out
[44:09] and blocks it so that you could do it
[44:10] without
[44:12] grudging you're doing it without any
[44:14] expectation and return because there's
[44:15] some value to it and there there's some
[44:17] worth there there's a desire towards it
[44:19] use Hospitality one to another without
[44:22] grudging so that that word is the same
[44:24] with that uh given to hospitality
[44:26] there's several other scriptures we
[44:27] could have used about receiving and
[44:29] welcoming and Hospitality it's a very
[44:31] important concept here in the word of
[44:33] God he says as every man hath received
[44:37] the
[44:38] gift now when we say receive the gift I
[44:41] want you to think of it more in that
[44:43] sense of how puus uh received the gift
[44:46] how that it means to welcome and hold
[44:48] attention be held by their they hold
[44:51] your attention you hold theirs it's this
[44:53] coming together this supporting this
[44:55] holding together
[44:58] as many has received the gift if I can
[45:01] say the gift of Christ presence as many
[45:03] has received it even so Minister the
[45:06] gift one to another now that that kind
[45:09] of elevates the stakes a little bit uh
[45:11] no punt on eating but rather that does
[45:13] speak to what is uh in play and what
[45:15] we're to be doing that now I realize
[45:17] that having received the gift of his
[45:19] presence I would like to also when I'm
[45:22] given to hospitality when I'm given to
[45:24] entertaining when I'm given to this
[45:26] fervent ch among ourselves that I
[45:28] likewise would Minister his
[45:32] presence it's telling us that we ought
[45:34] to welcome and receive the word and
[45:36] having welcomed and received the word we
[45:38] ought to minister the same one to
[45:40] another as good stewards of the manifold
[45:42] grace of God what we have received in
[45:44] this hour has come with the
[45:45] pronouncement of Grace Grace what we've
[45:48] received in this hour is that which is
[45:49] perfect there is something that has come
[45:52] that has entered I trust that you have
[45:54] received it for that Christ has been
[45:57] revealed to us to those he said that can
[46:00] receive it
[46:03] amen
[46:05] this receive the gift this is for this
[46:10] is for the young
[46:12] people it it could have actually been
[46:14] translated in modern language receive
[46:15] the
[46:16] Riz because word is
[46:19] charisma and actually caught and seized
[46:24] the
[46:24] Charisma the gift
[46:27] he says attend to it attend to the gift
[46:31] acknowledge it welcome receive it then
[46:33] employ it in Minister it
[46:36] likewise let it have our
[46:39] attention let it be our
[46:43] desire this is what it means to welcome
[46:45] and receive the
[46:47] word so brother B says as Christ says I
[46:50] am the word welcome and receive me if
[46:51] you want me in your midst I'm here but
[46:53] if you want me welcome and receive me
[46:57] amen so brother brandom gives us some
[46:58] greater depth and Clarity says I wonder
[47:00] if we are sufficiently
[47:03] impressed with the word in our
[47:05] midst sufficiently impressed impressed
[47:08] is a strong influence Upon A positive
[47:11] impact to be deeply influenced by
[47:13] something sufficiently it's to a
[47:16] satisfactory degree in other words it it
[47:18] meets this a standard is something
[47:21] sufficient it meets the standard are we
[47:23] sufficiently impressed
[47:27] again I want to bring you into that kind
[47:28] of that
[47:31] Continuum to be sufficiently impressed
[47:33] it's not just feeling happy or
[47:35] emotional acknowledging or seeing or
[47:38] knowing he's been invited and he's come
[47:39] but it's being gripped by Christ are you
[47:43] sufficiently impressed it's not to say
[47:45] well I'm impressed I impressed he came I
[47:48] am impressed he's here I am impressed I
[47:50] am impressed but rather sufficiently
[47:51] impressed does it meet the standard of
[47:53] what we ought to be Desiring and what we
[47:55] ought to have have you been held by
[47:57] Christ held spell Spellbound have you
[48:00] been seized by
[48:02] him in 1 John 1: 1 to4 these verses here
[48:07] so beautifully pick up on the same theme
[48:09] of John chapter 1 that which was from
[48:11] the beginning which we have heard which
[48:13] we have seen with her eyes which we have
[48:15] looked upon and our hands have handled
[48:18] of the word of Life there it is it's
[48:21] more than just hearing and knowing and
[48:23] seeing but now as we've heard them we've
[48:25] seen them we've looked upon them we've
[48:26] handled
[48:28] him taking a hold of it the word of life
[48:32] for the life was manifested with the
[48:34] life which is the light of men and Light
[48:37] which is the life of men for the life
[48:39] was manifested and we have seen it and
[48:41] therefore having seen it received it we
[48:43] bear witness and show unto you that
[48:45] eternal life which was with the father
[48:47] and was manifested unto us notice this
[48:50] stewardship of the gift of Christ that
[48:53] which we have seen and heard declare we
[48:55] unto you that ye also have fellowship
[48:57] with
[48:58] us this is in the pattern of first
[49:00] timoth 1 Peter chapter 4 this Grace
[49:03] which has been ministered to us we will
[49:05] also give there's a Grace to be brought
[49:07] to at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:09] there's a Salvation to be revealed at
[49:10] the end to those that receive it employ
[49:12] it Minister it give attention to
[49:15] it we declare to you that we you may
[49:17] have fellowship with us and truly our
[49:19] fellowship is with the father and with
[49:20] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[49:23] write we unto you that your joy may be
[49:26] full
[49:27] amen joyful full of joy we've touched on
[49:30] this theme in the past when it comes to
[49:31] Christmas that your joy may be
[49:34] full I know this may seem to be
[49:36] semantics but I want to take a different
[49:38] just kind of draw a line between just
[49:40] being happy the emotional side of things
[49:43] the feelings the
[49:45] emotions because happiness is an emotion
[49:47] you'll feel by through Personal
[49:49] Achievement you've accomplished
[49:50] something you've done something you'll
[49:51] experience uh happiness so happiness can
[49:54] be created synthesized even
[49:57] but this the word was written that your
[50:00] joy may be full in Proverbs 1611 that
[50:03] will show me the path of life in thy
[50:06] presence is fullness of joy at thy right
[50:09] hand there are Pleasures forever more I
[50:11] don't say this so that we would just
[50:12] Mark out any place happy or uh H is used
[50:16] or and say Well only real Joy only real
[50:18] Joy but rather just to express that
[50:19] there is a different level of emotion
[50:21] there's a different level of energy in
[50:24] thy presence is the fullness of joy I I
[50:27] write this to you and I testify of
[50:29] Christ the word of life that your joy
[50:31] may be full not just happiness which can
[50:33] be created not just happiness which seem
[50:35] to be arbitrary arbitrary and hard to
[50:38] predict but a
[50:39] joy a joy which is the state of the Soul
[50:42] when it experiences God's
[50:45] presence The Joy which is the state of
[50:47] the Soul which creates even in some
[50:48] paradoxical way a fullness but yet a
[50:51] desire and a longing for
[50:53] more our experience in our lives should
[50:56] be more than just just acceptance and
[50:58] more than
[50:59] emotion that's maybe the danger when we
[51:02] polarize on those things just believe
[51:03] just believe just believe no no no no no
[51:05] you want to feel you want to feel you
[51:06] want to feel and then we just create
[51:08] this these two po these two Polar
[51:10] Opposites and you got to pick a
[51:13] camp our experience should be more than
[51:15] acceptance if your life becomes merely
[51:19] acceptance you'll always bounce between
[51:20] belief and
[51:22] doubt I'm coming to this is just every
[51:25] I'm leading to this I'm closing so if
[51:26] you've been kind of waiting until I get
[51:28] to my point it's too late but join us
[51:31] now join us now and you'll get something
[51:33] out of this if you've merely believed
[51:35] and you have belief and you're calling
[51:37] it faith and it's an intellectual Faith
[51:39] your life will be defined of these
[51:41] plateaus of I believe and now I'm
[51:44] doubting and you'll vacillate and you'll
[51:46] live between the
[51:48] two if you're experienceing your
[51:51] attitude towards the word of God is one
[51:52] of emotion you'll live vacillating
[51:54] between happiness and sadness
[51:57] boy I felt all good then now I don't
[51:58] feel so good I really wanted to praise
[52:00] then I don't feel like praising
[52:01] now but when we measure ourselves by
[52:04] whether or not we're welcoming and
[52:06] receiving the word there's still yet a
[52:09] binary proposition but it's one that
[52:11] really gets our attention because when
[52:14] it becomes a question of hunger and
[52:16] desire and welcoming receiving you are
[52:18] either seeking or you've become
[52:21] apathetic not a question of I believe
[52:23] and I'm doubting well I think it's true
[52:24] but I don't know if it is or I'm happy
[52:25] and I'm sad but now it's merely are you
[52:28] seeking are you seeking or have you
[52:30] become dull right have you become
[52:32] Melancholy have you become
[52:37] apathetic a Jewish philosopher which I
[52:39] understand in the 1900s I understand was
[52:41] baptized into Christianity before their
[52:43] death is at least the testimony I
[52:46] thought this statement so perfectly
[52:47] summed up what I was trying to express
[52:50] the danger is not lest the soul should
[52:52] doubt whether there's any
[52:54] bread if we could just think of this in
[52:56] terms of hunger one thing have I desired
[52:59] and it's the danger is not
[53:02] believing or that the so Soul would
[53:04] doubt there's any bread but lest by a
[53:07] lie it should persuade itself that it is
[53:10] not
[53:12] hungry and I believe that's where many
[53:15] people have gotten anymore is instead of
[53:18] not doubting sure they just convince
[53:21] themselves there's not any
[53:24] bread they say well we may believe it
[53:26] and we may exist it but I'm not
[53:29] hungry the danger is not the soul that
[53:32] doubts whether there's any
[53:35] Christ but the lie that it should
[53:37] persuade itself that it does not need it
[53:39] nor want it is not hungry for
[53:44] it the danger of the believer is not
[53:47] that we do not that we that we would
[53:49] doubt the
[53:51] word but that our soul would not be
[53:53] hungry for
[53:54] it the danger this hour is not that our
[53:57] souls would disbelieve the message of
[53:59] the hour but rather our souls are no
[54:01] longer longing for it we've tried to
[54:03] position as well are you happy are you
[54:05] excited yeah okay you're in do you
[54:07] believe it yeah then you're in do you
[54:08] doubt well I'm not so sure you're not
[54:10] excited well then I'm not so sure and we
[54:12] put in these camps where we could just
[54:13] be enthused and so we got it we can just
[54:15] be Believers so we got it but I believe
[54:17] the real question is are you seeking it
[54:19] are you welcoming it are you receiving
[54:21] it or have you become
[54:24] apathetic has it merely been distilled
[54:26] down to emotion or intellectualism that
[54:28] can all be sensitized and synthesized
[54:31] and created in the mind or is there
[54:33] something deep within your souls that
[54:34] says I want it I believe in
[54:38] it oh let us not be guilty of doubting
[54:41] that we're
[54:43] hungry brother Bram says in the
[54:45] indictment I've read this several times
[54:46] quoted it many times recently today men
[54:48] walk ignorantly they don't know that's
[54:51] the truth go and find what truth he's
[54:52] talking about in the indictment the
[54:54] crucifixion of Jesus Christ again in
[54:56] this hour they think it's some kind of
[54:59] ism maybe they think it's bromism or
[55:01] something they don't dig down deep
[55:03] enough to get into the spirit of
[55:08] Revelation what is it it's not that
[55:10] they don't believe there's the word they
[55:13] don't believe it's bread the living
[55:14] bread of life they just don't they're
[55:17] just not
[55:18] hungry they've convinced themselves it's
[55:20] not what they need they con convince
[55:22] themselves this is not what's been
[55:23] promised they don't dig down deep enough
[55:25] to get into the Spirit of Revelation
[55:27] they don't pray enough they don't call
[55:29] upon God enough they just take it
[55:33] lightly take it oh well I believe
[55:34] there's a God
[55:36] sure he talks about how the devil
[55:38] believes more than even some people
[55:39] profess to believe it he says people
[55:41] just believe it and go
[55:47] on if you look at this in the image of
[55:49] Simon the Pharisee or Martha even in her
[55:52] own house they just invite it invite his
[55:54] presence he's there can acknowledge
[55:57] it can be busy serving this is the
[56:00] danger even of really strong robust
[56:02] churches to find a place for everyone to
[56:04] be a Martha and no one's ever a
[56:06] Mary because they come to church they do
[56:09] this and they do this and they serve
[56:10] they serve they serve the gift and they
[56:11] serve the body and they serve the church
[56:12] they serve the pastor and they're all
[56:13] doing things everyone stays busy as
[56:14] Martha is but they're all encumbered and
[56:16] no one is doing the better part and so
[56:18] you know what the word is what that's
[56:20] the only reason why we're here take the
[56:23] Torah out of the the the houses of
[56:25] seeking what are they therefore might as
[56:26] well play pickle ball right some of the
[56:29] hipsters said yeah and there's just this
[56:32] idea that if you that if we could just
[56:34] stay busy we're just all Martha we're no
[56:36] different than
[56:44] Simon receiving the gift of Christ's
[56:49] presence it's a challenge to your soul
[56:52] today where do you find your bread
[56:59] Joy is the state of the soul that
[57:00] experiences God's presence creates that
[57:03] longing for
[57:05] more I'm not just
[57:07] serving it's being hospitable it's
[57:10] welcoming and receiving I I'm not just
[57:13] inviting but I I I I'm paying attention
[57:16] to I'm entertained by I'm entertaining
[57:22] Christ we it's 11:33 now so I know that
[57:25] we're pushing pushing this a little long
[57:27] I didn't know if I'd even be able to get
[57:29] this far this morning I want to finish
[57:31] with this story of in Genesis chapter
[57:34] 32 verses 22 to 30 brother abam say
[57:37] don't dig down deep enough you know what
[57:40] that means you're going to have to get
[57:42] dirty you have to roll up your sleeves
[57:44] and dig down
[57:47] deep pray enough you're going to Bow
[57:49] yourself to the Earth you're going to
[57:52] humble yourself to God there's a lot
[57:54] that's in this image for us to challenge
[57:55] ourselves
[57:58] to welcome and receive the word to be
[58:00] sufficiently
[58:01] impressed sufficiently impressed does it
[58:04] meet the standard that's required to
[58:06] have him in your midst we can say God go
[58:08] Christ goes everywhere he's invited he's
[58:10] been invited to our churches he's been
[58:12] invited into our hearts he's been
[58:13] invited into our homes but are we are we
[58:15] Simon's and Martha or are we Mary's are
[58:17] we that woman that knelt At His
[58:21] Feet I I want just to consider that
[58:24] because he could be here
[58:27] he could be
[58:28] present but having not been welcomed and
[58:31] received then we're not sufficiently
[58:33] impressed we won't get the benefit we
[58:36] haven't we haven't met that Mark to
[58:37] where he can say he we're unified we're
[58:41] uniting and here in Genesis 32: 22 to30
[58:45] Jacob has let his family go on before
[58:47] him and he's left
[58:48] alone you know
[58:50] Jacob the heel Grabber The Deceiver
[58:56] looking even at how he slept and he saw
[58:58] that lad he said this is the house of
[58:59] the Lord says and there Wrestled a man
[59:02] this is different in and there Wrestled
[59:03] a man with him until the breaking of the
[59:05] day now just it's like he's there and
[59:07] all of a sudden he's wrestling so would
[59:09] have liked the backstory to that but
[59:11] here he's wrestling with the man all
[59:13] night until the sun comes up and when he
[59:16] the man saw that he prevailed not
[59:17] against him he touched the hollow of his
[59:20] thigh and the Hall of Jacob's thigh was
[59:22] out of joint as he wrestled with him
[59:25] this is quite a strug
[59:27] at this point it's a confusing narrative
[59:29] in story if you don't know what's
[59:30] happening you say oh my goodness Jo
[59:32] Jacob's been attacked in the night and
[59:34] he's been fighting with this man all
[59:35] night and because he uh he can't the man
[59:38] can't get away he he touches him on the
[59:40] hollow of his thigh and he puts
[59:42] something out of joint as a means of
[59:43] trying to get him to let go this is
[59:44] quite a wrestling match and he said let
[59:47] me go for the day
[59:49] breth such a beautiful challenge here I
[59:53] I I I think you you know what's coming
[59:55] but if we could just look at it without
[59:56] the context what a struggle what a
[59:59] fight and then this is where we first
[1:00:02] get an idea that oh he hasn't been
[1:00:04] mugged this is not an attacker he's not
[1:00:06] trying to keep them down until the
[1:00:07] police come he says I will not let thee
[1:00:10] go except thou bless
[1:00:12] me so Jacob knew listen somebody visited
[1:00:17] him in the
[1:00:19] night somebody drew near and got close
[1:00:23] enough for Jacob to grab a hold of them
[1:00:26] he wasn't happy with him just coming by
[1:00:29] he wasn't just happy with him being near
[1:00:31] but Jacob laid a hold of him and seized
[1:00:33] him and wouldn't let him go all night
[1:00:36] even when it hurt even when it would
[1:00:38] change the way he walked even if it was
[1:00:40] painful he held onto him and he finally
[1:00:43] said church is over let go of me he said
[1:00:45] I'm not letting you go until you bless
[1:00:48] me and then at that he says unto him
[1:00:52] that's one he's wrestling with says what
[1:00:53] is thy name and he said Jacob
[1:00:56] now what was the purpose of this for him
[1:00:59] to confess who he was I'm a heal Grabber
[1:01:02] I'm a I'm a deceiver I'm a
[1:01:04] sinner and since he grabbed a hold of
[1:01:07] them and wouldn't let him go this so
[1:01:08] pleased the Lord he said this is now the
[1:01:11] Lord speaking this is the Angel Lord
[1:01:13] however you want to look at this he says
[1:01:14] thy name shall be called No More Jacob
[1:01:17] but
[1:01:19] Israel the children of Israel the Jews
[1:01:21] the very name that those that
[1:01:22] established the synagogues the houses of
[1:01:24] seeking
[1:01:26] that to whom the temple pertained here's
[1:01:28] this namesake for these people
[1:01:30] Israelites you're not Jacob the deceiver
[1:01:32] The Sinner the one that comes second but
[1:01:34] Isel for as a prince thou Hast hast thou
[1:01:36] power with God and with men and Hast
[1:01:40] prevailed the word Israel is often
[1:01:43] translated too in the atmology of it
[1:01:45] even to the Hebrews it means one who
[1:01:46] wrestles with God one who has formed
[1:01:49] this relationship this connection with
[1:01:52] God he won't let go no matter the
[1:01:54] consequences because the blessing is
[1:01:56] what's the ultimate that's what we saw
[1:01:57] in Abraham the union with God his faith
[1:02:00] with God and the blessing the promise
[1:02:02] and here Jacob expresses this beautiful
[1:02:04] Union I'm going to hold on you and I
[1:02:06] won't let go until you bless me he says
[1:02:08] I'm going to change your name you won't
[1:02:09] be jacobites you won't be deceivers you
[1:02:11] won't be Hill Grabbers you won't be
[1:02:13] coming in second we're going to change
[1:02:14] the name of all my chosen people to
[1:02:17] Israelites one who wrestles with God
[1:02:20] who's not in a negative sense but one
[1:02:21] who is uh trying to know him and decease
[1:02:25] him to grab hold of him to have
[1:02:26] relationship with
[1:02:28] him this is why David could express it
[1:02:30] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[1:02:32] that will I seek after that's why Moses
[1:02:34] said show me thy Glory it was something
[1:02:36] thou inherit in an Israelite to it just
[1:02:39] wasn't a matter well I'm circumcised it
[1:02:40] wasn't just a matter of the promise was
[1:02:42] given but we want to see the Messiah we
[1:02:45] want to possess our land amen this is
[1:02:48] true Faith true
[1:02:51] experience and Jacob asked him and said
[1:02:53] tell me I pray thee thy name
[1:02:56] and he said wherefore is it that thou
[1:02:57] Dost ask after my name and notice this
[1:03:01] and he blessed him
[1:03:03] there he knew who he was now the one who
[1:03:07] could give the blessing the one who
[1:03:09] could confer it upon him and Jacob
[1:03:10] called the name of the place
[1:03:12] Pinel for I have seen God face to face
[1:03:18] and my life is
[1:03:20] preserved this experience brought him
[1:03:23] face to face with God he named it pel
[1:03:26] because that's the one he was wrestling
[1:03:27] with it was in the very name that he's
[1:03:30] given he was willing to dig down deep
[1:03:33] enough he was willing to get dirty he's
[1:03:34] willing not to let
[1:03:36] go wasn't happy just to have them who
[1:03:38] knows how the the story may be and and
[1:03:41] I'm not trying to contrive something but
[1:03:43] perhaps Jacob is just laying there he's
[1:03:46] building a little fire he's making his
[1:03:47] bed and a traveler comes and sits down
[1:03:50] with him and being warmed by the fire
[1:03:53] and they talk for a little bit and the
[1:03:54] man gets up to go and Jacob starts
[1:03:56] thinking wait a minute wait a minute and
[1:03:58] he constrains him to stay and says Terry
[1:04:01] and he says no I'm leaving and Jacob
[1:04:03] says you're not leaving and he grabs a
[1:04:05] hold and begins to wrestle out why
[1:04:07] something in him hungered something
[1:04:09] desired there was something and he
[1:04:10] wasn't going to let go and the man says
[1:04:12] let me go and he says I won't till you
[1:04:13] bless
[1:04:15] me and it doesn't maybe seem very
[1:04:17] welcoming and receiving to
[1:04:20] wrestle but I to me as I thought about
[1:04:22] this I could just imagine that the angel
[1:04:24] Lord says let me go in his heart is
[1:04:26] saying don't let me go Jacob hold on to
[1:04:30] the last Jacob whatever you do it may
[1:04:33] seem like I'm running it may seem like
[1:04:34] I'm fighting it may seem like I don't
[1:04:36] want you it may seem to be a little
[1:04:37] distant maybe a little cold but don't
[1:04:39] stop seeking don't stop longing I may
[1:04:41] seem far from you but seek my face you
[1:04:43] may not have heard my voice but seek my
[1:04:45] face you may think I'm far away but seek
[1:04:47] my face Jacob Don't Let Go Jacob don't
[1:04:50] let go I believe we're living in a time
[1:04:53] when we as Believers don't let go keep
[1:04:56] wrestling keep fighting keep seeking
[1:04:59] keep
[1:05:00] searching to be seized upon by Joy amen
[1:05:04] not just made Happy not just made
[1:05:06] intellectual but be seized upon amen
[1:05:12] amen see him face to face brother Bram
[1:05:14] and the unchangeable God says and then
[1:05:16] Jacob all Disturbed and perplexed and in
[1:05:19] trouble said his wives across the Little
[1:05:21] Brook went back on the other side in an
[1:05:23] unexpected place and an unexpected time
[1:05:26] he melt go met God in an unexpected
[1:05:29] way what a way to meet God in a
[1:05:33] wrestling
[1:05:35] match Brothers you can come to your
[1:05:37] instruments but it was
[1:05:38] God regardless of whether he's in a
[1:05:41] burning bush or a wrestling match it was
[1:05:43] God the main thing was Jacob think about
[1:05:46] Jacob he had had dreams and visions and
[1:05:48] so
[1:05:49] forth but this was one time he could lay
[1:05:51] his hand on something and say it's
[1:05:54] God and he's able to to hold on to it
[1:05:56] until the blessing come oh if we could
[1:05:59] do that if we could find a spot where we
[1:06:01] could see God whether it's in his word
[1:06:04] wherever it is and recognize it's God
[1:06:06] and hold on to it until the blessing
[1:06:10] comes I hope that I'm not getting too
[1:06:12] far away from my subject of receiving
[1:06:15] the gift of Christ's
[1:06:17] presence listen if anybody is wrapping
[1:06:20] gifts and placing them under a tree or a
[1:06:22] nativity or have them hidden somewhere
[1:06:24] what is it all of your little ones are
[1:06:25] begging to do right now open presence
[1:06:29] it's not enough just to see it there
[1:06:32] it's not enough to know that it's been
[1:06:33] bought it's not enough to have good nice
[1:06:35] wrapping paper on it in a bow what they
[1:06:38] want it they want to open it they want
[1:06:40] to unravel it they want to see what it
[1:06:42] really is they can shake it they may
[1:06:43] know that is curiously in the shape of a
[1:06:48] bike right and they they they may even
[1:06:50] know this is exactly what I wanted it's
[1:06:52] shaped like a baseball bat this looks
[1:06:54] like a fishing pole whatever might be
[1:06:56] it's not enough to know what it is it's
[1:06:58] not enough to know what's behind the
[1:07:00] paper they want it in their hands they
[1:07:02] want to have it they want to use it oh
[1:07:05] God help us to think about the wrapped
[1:07:07] gift that's here who's wanting to be
[1:07:10] unwrapped he wants us to run to him and
[1:07:12] to grab a hold of
[1:07:14] [Music]
[1:07:16] him he says wrestle it out with
[1:07:19] God God promised to do it God said if
[1:07:23] we'd seek we'd find
[1:07:26] asking it shall be given knocking it'll
[1:07:27] be open he said every word is
[1:07:31] true when Jacob got a hold of something
[1:07:33] that he could look at hold to with his
[1:07:36] hands and seeing that it was God he
[1:07:39] would not turn it
[1:07:41] loose oh if
[1:07:43] Christendom oh if Believers and message
[1:07:45] Believers my terms there but oh if
[1:07:47] christiandom could do that if you can
[1:07:50] lay your hand on a hold of something
[1:07:52] that's
[1:07:54] real catch a vision of God and see his
[1:07:59] presence and hold on to it until God
[1:08:01] sends the answer back and the
[1:08:05] blessing it may not seem to be very
[1:08:07] welcoming in the
[1:08:11] context of Jacob wrestling with the
[1:08:16] Lord but that's what it means to
[1:08:19] entertain is to
[1:08:21] hold to hold
[1:08:24] together and in the image of being
[1:08:27] seized I am apprehended by Christ I want
[1:08:31] to apprehend him I want to lay a hold of
[1:08:34] eternal
[1:08:36] life I I want to pursue
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:45] this give some thought as this year
[1:08:47] comes to a close
[1:08:49] of what it means to welcome and receive
[1:08:52] the word of
[1:08:54] God and if we could just stand
[1:08:57] together and in our hearts think about
[1:09:00] these things I'd like to read one last
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:20] statement he says we receive your
[1:09:22] Christmas

[1:11:21] faith and belief I'm not trying to be
[1:11:22] moved toward more emotion but the long
[1:11:25] of my soul that's really what faith is
[1:11:27] it's desire it's longing that's what
[1:11:29] heaven is Lord help me to just wash me

[1:12:31] stable as it
[1:12:34] were

[1:12:41] longing we want to have a desire for
[1:12:43] you so I'm asking and I'm praying Lord
[1:12:46] that you could just wash us and Purge us
[1:12:47] and that we could act on the least
[1:12:49] desire today to know you and to serve
[1:12:52] you and may we be a people that's not so
[1:12:55] much caught up in semantics and Theology
[1:12:57] and periods and explanation and
[1:12:59] intellect or emotion but Lord be a
[1:13:02] people who are defined as wrestling with
[1:13:04] you a relationship a longing a desire
[1:13:09] where what we're looking for and what
[1:13:10] we're seeking in our in our prayer and
[1:13:12] our studies and our coming to church is
[1:13:14] to know you what we're looking for in
[1:13:16] others in our fellowship is to know you
[1:13:17] more it's a longing it's a desire not
[1:13:20] just an affirmation of what we
[1:13:22] believe and Lord the more we've looked
[1:13:24] to affirmation or emotion the more we've
[1:13:26] looked to be affirmed by intellect or
[1:13:27] affirmed by emotion the further away
[1:13:29] we've gotten from desire it's made us
[1:13:31] more complacent it's made us more
[1:13:33] aesthetic it's made us more
[1:13:35] apathetic Lord in doing so we become
[1:13:37] pathetic we fight more with each other
[1:13:39] than we wrestle it out with you and oh
[1:13:42] God help us and Shake us and wake us
[1:13:44] today maybe as you did that night around
[1:13:46] the fire you got Jacob's attention and
[1:13:49] something stirred with him and he
[1:13:50] grabbed a hold of you and he wrestled it
[1:13:52] out until his name was changed his walk
[1:13:55] was changed his life was changed and
[1:13:57] when he crossed that Brook the next day
[1:13:58] he was
[1:14:00] different oh God may we be different in
[1:14:03] this coming
[1:14:04] year if you would delay until the first
[1:14:08] may we find that it's not resolutions
[1:14:10] that made the difference but a
[1:14:12] revelation a recommittal burning of the
[1:14:15] old book not a turning of a new page but
[1:14:18] away with apathy and a rekindling of
[1:14:21] Desire one thing desired amen
[1:14:25] bless us today I pray Lord as we commit
[1:14:27] ourselves to you and we ask these things
[1:14:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus
