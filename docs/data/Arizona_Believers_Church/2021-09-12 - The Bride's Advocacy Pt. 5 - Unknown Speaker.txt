TRANSCRIPT
========================================
second corinthians chapter five second corinthians chapter five is where i'd like to read i apologize if i've forgotten any announcements i want to begin with verse 17. and read to verse 21. the first scripture that we're going to read is very familiar to us in terms of if being a new creature and that by virtue of the new birth a man is sealed by the holy ghost and an individual becomes a new creation new creatures in christ jesus but then the preceding verses to me really amplify what this purpose is and i hope that this can become a very uh just a cornerstone scripture for you verse 17. therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new now notice how he continues because he's going to take all things from verse 17 and this kind of leads him into this thought process on reconciliation and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation now notice what he's saying here all things are god all things are of god now he wants to amplify what this all things are become new what it really means for us and he said is given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that god was in christ recklessly in the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are this is what all things will become new notice this now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him and notice those bookends in 17 and 21 new creature old things are passed away all things are become new and we have been made the very righteousness of god in him god bless you you can take your seats i want to just jump right into this in terms of continuing on part five of the bride's advocacy very excited in terms of the subject matter i feel like i'm coming right to the real emphasis that i had in the beginning of uh when we began to look at an advocate and we'd mentioned that we wanted to begin to deal with advocacy and we're taking from revelations chapter 22 verse 17 how that the spirit and the bride say come and that uh is emphasized to us in the message of the hour that the bride under her messenger is the final voice to the final age so we have to recognize this unnecessary calling and gifting in our lives as members of the bride that we are to be the final voice and as the final voice we're not voicing our opinions we're not voicing our conspiracy theories or suspicions we are actually a voice of christ the voice of god therefore we must advocate for the cause of christ wednesday night i don't really want to get into much of what we spoke on wednesday night i want to just kind of leave it as it was but and i appreciated all the positive feedback that we heard and even some insightful comments and questions related to it but the um there's a lot of anti there's a lot of causes a lot of things that we could be uh wrapped up in but what we want to find is at the end of the day we are pro-christ we are for christ as in revelations chapter 10 verse 11 it says that john thou must prophesy again unto all the world and people nations tongues and kings to prophesy again it means to plead the cause of god it's used of those who would in a calling in an office plead plead the cause of god so it's not their own cause not pleading their own case but they plead the cause of god as an advocate for the cause of christ and in doing so they urge others to receive the word they're urging them to be saved and to be rescued from the tribulation that's to come and this advocacy for christ is not self-promotion it is not the promotion of any particular personality we have to be careful with that many times uh there's certain dynamics that work within human nature sometimes there's dynamics that work within uh things that we fellowshipped around where things become very uh personality centric unfortunately within uh christianity these days especially within uh nominal christianity or the evangelical world church has become very pastor centric and it's really the name it's you know everyone knows about the name i could maybe mention a name to you and you wouldn't even know the name of the church you just know that hey that guy's all over the place and you wouldn't necessarily know the name of the church and so that's uh that's not there's a tendency to do that and so we want to be very careful that we don't just kind of shift into another mode where we start promoting personality but that we're promoting christ and to that end it's not a church promotion either but that we have this conviction that we as i said wednesday night we invite people to church and we say come and see and that's our that's our invitation that's a an effective witness that if anybody finds that being around us they get a little bit thirsty through our saltiness and they want to know and maybe you begin to witness or testify and you find i don't know how to explain this and i don't know how to do that well you had an experience with the word and that's why you are the way you are and so you invite them to come to church so that they can have an experience with the word and in coming and having an experience with the word they in turn will be the ones that are saying hey you know what god did this for me and you know this is in the bible and this has happened and the person i don't understand he goes well you know what just come and see that's what happened to me you just come and see and i guess i do want to touch on it a little bit as i made myself a note that picking up from wednesday night we need to be very careful not to conflate uh conservative political causes with the cause of christ then we have to be very careful about that and then let's just say that all of a sudden we have this epiphany we're like oh no i don't want to conflate conservative political policies uh with christianity we don't swing the other side and then think so therefore i must become a liberal no or a libertarian wherever you want to find yourself on a political spectrum that's something totally different as even the question was asked well you know should we vote well that's your civic duty that's a duty you would have as a citizen that's a right that you would exercise if your government gives you that opportunity and you would exercise that as a citizen of whatever jurisdiction you're in there's some people believers and christians in some places where the vote they may not even have a vote and even if they had a vote it would be a sham so the ability to vote voting or not voting isn't necessarily indicative of whether or not you're a christian that's your civic duty and what we have to be careful is that we don't get ourselves entangled in some sort of political quagmire or a war or cause and then in order to justify we say oh well brother branham said this and brother branham said that and the bible says this and the bible says that but we want to kind of disentangle ourselves from all the rhetoric that's in the world today and all the polarization and all the things that's taking place because political activism we could say even political advocacy advocacy for certain policies has taken over the evangelical world we have to be very careful that by virtue of common commerce and common ideals and things that we might share that we don't get swept up in that and there even i would say not just putting the a point in the finger at evangelicals just even christianity as a whole is being co-opted by politics and if you're like oh i don't know about that brother brother where is it going to end up combination of church and state there's going to be a union of it so it's taking place where man-made traditions and carnal agendas are kind of taking over and sweeping over identities and voices and in messages and and what you stand for and what you present so we're we're cautioning you do not become entangled in this culture of americana uh christianity there's a certain bravado a certain pride a certain uh you know we're christians and we have god-given rights and anymore those rights are guns right that's their god-given i have a god-given right to own ar-15 and we we have to take a step back and realize well no that's probably the right that's been granted to me by my natural you know like a citizenship and by a government and by a bill of rights and that we are governed by a different constitution we are governed by different bill of rights and it's those rights that we want to effectively exercise it's those rights that we want to stand up for now in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 20 this is in this being in our text i think it um i want to start here and end up in the same reading in the same in our text we touched on this wednesday night says now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us now that's a very profound phrase that he says we are ambassadors for christ and in that we are representing christ because an ambassador is a person who's sent from one sovereign power uh to another sovereign power so i'm sent by god and and so you're using that maybe in a political sense or nations since government sense he's saying i'm an ambassador for christ so christ has sent me and this ambassador this relationship is so strong as i beseech you it's as if god is beseeching you like you should take this message and what i'm declaring to you as being from god so he says we pray you this is a very heavy statement that i want you to i want this just to sink in deeper today we pray you in christ stead in christ said be you reconciled to god in christ said on christ's behalf representing him as if he was present before you that i'm declaring i'm representing the presence of christ i'm representing and declaring to you his power his attributes his authority his word so in christ's stead i am here as if one as if christ is present with you saying be reconciled take god at his word find this harmony in this union unity with god and this this relationship that paul has expounded upon here as an ambassador for christ and in christ's death now i want to come back to that but i want to kind of pick up um everything that we've been preaching since september last year i've been thinking a lot about who is my neighbor because a lot of these principles are building back into it but pick up some of these things we've been preaching through the first four parts of the bride's advocacy and how we begin to identify how paul approached uh relationships with people especially uh unbelievers and this is paul's justification as to why he would say hey i act in such a way to where i please i am all things to all men and uh and and i wanna i wanna please men i don't want to alienate people this was paul's reason for doing that he says i'm an ambassador for christ i am here in christ's dead so i have a i have another cause that i've got to be faithful to and even my sensitivities and things that i get my gander up and things that bother me i have to forget about all that and act in such a way that promotes the cause of christ because i have to ask myself what would jesus do how would he handle this situation and and i know that sounds somewhat of a cliche but even in that anymore the definition of jesus and the picture that's been painted of jesus isn't even a scriptural one anymore and so what paul was doing says i know what christ taught my sheep hear my voice and they follow me and they won't follow another and they see how christ said i sanctify myself for your sakes and he caught this revelation of jesus christ and so now he's saying i'm in christ's dead and so i'm going to act a particular way so that me as as an ambassador to christ are for god i am effective in this office as he said in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 33 even as i please all men in all things that's a statement that some could take say oh man yeah let's please men in all things whenever i'm with somebody uh uh who who smokes marijuana i want to smoke marijuana i don't want to offend them i'm not going to i'm not going to call them out if i'm in this group over here that likes to go do this well i'm going to go along with it because i don't want to offend that's not what paul is saying he says not seeking my own prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved just that phrase alone could become a real barrier to a lot of things that we say and do in a lot of ways that we present ourselves you say well i could i could kind of give in to that and i could go along with that because i don't want to offend him but in doing so would it promote salvation could it just confuse the picture all the more if if you continue down that path so he was not if when you read this even as i please all men in all things not seeking my own prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved remember he says i do this and i conduct myself restrain myself in all things in every way so i could save some so it wasn't that all would be saved it would be worth it just to save some and again remember he's not doing this carnally he's doing this in christ's stead so when you read this in chapter 9 as we went through chapter 9 he says similar things in chapter 10 he's saying similar things he's not doing this as paul's opinion or paul's this is ah that's just paul being paul no he's saying i must do this in christ stead so he did not want to hinder the effectiveness of the word i'm an ambassador for christ i have a message my behavior can convolute that the things i say the things i do can make a clout cloud that up and could cause confusion lead others astray so he wanted to act in such a way that it would make it easier for others to receive what he had to say i'm sure that we we all know people uh in in our lives or maybe we've been that person we could just be honest we've been that person where we we're saying the right thing but that or we're hearing the right thing but it's really hard to receive it from that person why because they're always doing saying this and they're always saying that and they could come and tell you the absolute truth and it would have been the worst thing that could have happened because it's coming from them and they finally are rational they're finally sharing a stable thought they're actually speaking the truth but because they're the source of it you think ah they got a bone to pick oh they're just being critical well they said this they said that and so paul realizes man i can pick a lot of causes and i can say a lot of things and i could die on a lot of mountains to when it comes time to sharing the truth of the gospel they just kind of take that and they throw it in with everything else and so he's very careful about that the moderation of opinion the modesty of expression uh the intensity with which we align with certain causes or the certain things that we give voice to even the restraint of words and conduct this was done so that he wouldn't stir up unnecessary opposition to himself he was already different he's gonna he already had gentiles wouldn't like him and the jews were wanting to kill him after he was converted so he realized look i'm preaching a controversial gospel i'm preaching things that go against the status quo of my organization the denominations and the prevailing word for that are the traditions of that day and there's been a revelation come and i've received this revelation and i'm already on the wrong side with these guys and if i act in a way to where they can put me in this camp or put me in that camp if i can if i act the wrong way where i offend their sensibilities it's only going to make it even harder for them to receive what i'm saying so i'm going to i'm going to be very careful i'm going to be very careful the way that i live and the way that i act so that i don't stir up opposition against myself because ultimately that would be against the word they could hate he's like hey they could hate me as an ambassador i got thick skin i can handle it and bless god i don't care what other people think and and here he has this attitude but then christ is saying well what about me because if they reject you you're my ambassador how else if they reject you how else are they going to hear hear what i'm trying to say to them so if you rejected for the cause of christ or for the word's sake hey we've been taught that that's going to happen but if we if we're venturing into areas of india where it should be indifferent if we're venturing into areas where god doesn't have a say on it but we're very dogmatic about it we're hindering the cause of christ so he did not want to rile up opposition or even offend or stir up other people's sensitivities if by chance it would kill his influence and i think that's just a review for us as we've been looking at first corinthians chapters 9 and 10 and places in romans in philippians chapter 1 verses 12 to 17 i had had this in my notes for all the services but it just seemed like it wasn't fitting and and i was weighing it last night and i thought well where is it gonna you know should i just cut it out again i felt like the lord just placed it here he says i but i would i would you should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel there's a lot of things that we could identify that were happening to him but yet paul recognizes that these things were happening for the benefit and the best of the gospel paul wasn't being imprisoned for selling drugs he wasn't being imprisoned for human trafficking uh paul was in prison these things that were happening to him were because he was advocating for christ so he felt like hey if it's happening while i'm advocating for christ if i go to jail i'm not serving a sentence i'm serving a purpose and so that was the attitude that he had then he identifies something very peculiar so that my bonds in christ are manifested in all the palace and in all other places and and this is it's verse 14 where the peculiarities to me begin but that's amplifying how that i'm a prisoner for christ and guess what's happening i'm declaring this everywhere i go he's given him a a particular audience now he says and many of the brethren and the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear and so this was actually a causing son to be like you know what let's preach it and let's just lay the word out there and and paul took this took this on and and he suffered this then then we can do it also and there's actually a reading of this that implies that there were some people saying oh good now that paul's locked up we can preach you're like oh good now that we don't have to worry about him coming around and messing things up we can preach because then he says some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preached christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds so he's actually identifying the fact that here i am i am in prison because i preach the gospel and i believe that this has happened for the furtherance of the gospel but now there are people who are more bold to preach because now i've been thrown in prison and they're not being sincere about it they preach because they're jealous and they're doing it to add affliction to my bonds so they don't have the right motive in preaching the gospel in that in that sense he said the other of love knowing he says that i am set for the defense of the gospel that there is then some preaching in the right way with the right motive but he says that there's those that recognize the asset for the defense of the gospel what was his concern the furtherance of the gospel and paul in doing this is refuting any assertion that he was preaching the gospel for his own glory he's refuted this contention oh paul you were just doing to make a name for yourself you just wanted to carve out your own niche you just wanted to have a following this was a meal ticket this was a money grab he's refuting any assertion that he sought his own glory and preaching the gospel but he says i am set for the defense of the gospel apologia that's where we get the term apologetics apology is a reason statement or argument to to give an apologia uh to be set for the defenses to give a full account of now there's those that take this scripture and say that paul was set for the defense of the gospel they take apologia and there's this whole kind of discipline within christianity of apologetics that means i am set to explain everything in the bible i am set to explain any paradox any inconsistency i want to be able to rightly divide the word of truth and be able to lay out everything in such a way to where every truth can be explained perfectly in a language that could cause someone to say i see it i understand it there's there's an inherent danger in becoming apologetics because then you leave out the element of faith that many times god says things in a puzzling way so that faith completes the puzzle but apologetics seek to find every peace turn it around the right way and make a perfect picture of their own discipline and effort in the word of god and studying context and language and and all those different things but paul is is not making the argument that i'm set for the defense of the gospel in that i'm i'm apologizing for it or i'm trying to explain it or i'm just trying to reason with you to convince you but rather i am set for the defense of the gospel but not primarily not a defense of himself oh he's refuting his contention oh well you know paul just is in it for his own good he said no i'm set for the defense of the gospel i'm not in this for my own gain as a matter of fact everything i'm doing i'm doing in christ's stead not that i can have a name and be memorialized but that others might be saved so he's identifying his motive that's important number one to recognize that others preach out of envy and some strife and some condition contention others for filthy lucr and we rejoice that the gospel is being preached but he's saying they're preaching from the wrong reasons i'm preaching because my burden is actually for people to hear the word and receive it but then it's also carries with it this also that may not necessarily double meaning but this is assumed in the meaning my i am set for the defense of the gospel not myself so in fact he's saying my life in my manner of life in my living and my preaching is an argument for the gospel i'm not just trying to reason with your carnal mind and sit down and explain it to you and get you to accept it and prove it and and i'm not trying to prove it or explain it but i am set as an argument i am set as an advocate for the benefits of the gospel the blessings of the gospel i am set as an advocate who desires to see the gospel successful so my life and my thoughts and my actions are an argument for it to compel you to receive it not explain it to you so you can say oh yeah that makes sense does that make sense i can try to explain it to you but i trust you can ex catch kind of what paul is saying by pondering that word if it's a reasoned statement or argument i am set as an argument for the gospel how paul not by not by giving everybody what david said and typing this out showing the hebrews and everything but my life i'm in bonds because i preach the gospel let my character my conduct the way that i handle these adversities speak of the gospel of christ so now i want to take a few moments or i am going to take a few moments to touch on a couple things and in doing so i want to i want to identify the balance related to this i am as he says i am i please all men and all things i become all things to all men and the balance in that and the discernment because we're really challenging you to not get caught up in carnal things and get caught up in things that sound like that sounds like the shepherd but it's not the shepherd but to to but to moderate ourselves so that we can be effective witnesses of the gospel to be careful that we're keeping ourselves pure and unsolely to the things of the world and ideas and opinions that can really agitate us so that we can express christ in the right way that can be effective witness to others and we would decide that then others would hear the word and be saved and and as that kind of maybe that's a those are the things we've been preaching becomes kind of like a blow and uh tearing certain things down or trying to soften us up i recognize that it could be easy to be kind of pushed over into this other area where just kind of wishy-washy pushovers oh it doesn't really matter and we think just by being sappy right and just being sweet and kind you know that others like others will want what we have but there needs to be a balance there's a balance to this it wasn't paul i'm going to be sweet to everybody i'm just going to love everybody i'm doesn't really matter attitude no he had a he had a real solid foundation in the word that guided him so i want to talk about a balance and a discernment because paul's approach is not compromising there was no compromise in paul's approach and it certainly was not weakness there was not fear on paul's part paul did not go you know i'm going to walk real lightly around these guys because they might stone me or they might throw me in prison no paul was very discerning in situations and knew in this situation this is what i'm in christ's stead this is what i need to do i'm in this situation this is what i need to do and he's very careful to know when to speak and how to speak he used this discernment he was very balanced this sweet this meekness of christ it's this balance of christ that he achieved and that's what we need in our lives is the true meekness of christ i was pondering this and and maybe this might flow into a and actually a sermon or maybe uh um some preaching on and it could happen right now if you pulled hard enough but a lot of us like the fact that christ is a lion right and we have the spirit of christ and so the nature of a lion the nature of christ and and that that overcomer and that one with the flaming sword and riding on this horse and this mighty conqueror and we see these attributes of jesus christ and we really really love that and we think oh my yes that's what i am i'm the warrior he's the warrior christ i'm a warrior i'm a warrior for christ and we like to envision ourselves as a lion but let me just say this you have no right to be aligned until you first wear a lamb and so your your your training and your discipline you cannot properly be the line until you know fully how to be the lamb and and i mean that in the truest sense that we must have that nature of the lamb and work in that office of the lamb not that we would shed our physical blood but it's a life of sacrifice and the yielding to christ in this sweet reasonable reasonableness of christ and this meekness of christ and once we've learned to be the lamb it becomes almost second nature paradoxically to be the lion and it'll be channeled the right way there must be a balance now notice notice these things we might be kind of dropping back a little bit and it might even find a different gear because this is really just more teaching identifying some things here in galatians chapter 2. i want to read through it maybe as we go through it i can expound upon it or maybe when we're done i might just make a few points in this reading galatians chapter 2 verses 11 to 14. but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed so now you know this uh becoming all things to all men didn't apply anymore when it came to peter i mean we're reading about paul saying well i don't want to offend anybody and if somebody's a certain way i don't want to offend their sensibilities and you know kind of do this and do that and so this is i'm looking at another side of this ministry to where we see that it wasn't like paul just in every instance you know just i'm going to keep my mouth shut and keep my head down here is a situation where peter wasn't allowed really to be peter but he was stood up to his face he says for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles that certain being peter he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come the the the jews he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which are of the circumcision peter this is so on brand for peter he he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which of the circumcision and the other jews disassembled likewise with them so peter influences these other jews in so much that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation dissembled the simulation is hypocrisy they were they become hypocritical and even barnabas was carried away with his hypocrisy he says but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to notice what he's defending the truth of the gospel to those who ought to have known better i said unto peter before them alls when he says i withstood them to the face right got right up in his face and in front of everybody if thou being a jew live us after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compel us thou the gentiles to live as do the jews calling out a little bit of hypocrisy right i mean he's saying well wait a minute you're trying to force gentiles into circumcision or you're trying to force them to adopt these peculiarities of the of the jewish church there in jerusalem but yet i mean i i know you've behaved otherwise around gentiles and so paul rebukes peter because of hypocrisy and most importantly as you can see as he's calling it out and this is to me what connects so beautifully with what he's talking about in first corinthians 9 10 is he's actually calling peter out for acting against his own conscience like peter come on you know better you've confessed differently you're acting against your own conscience like it's not that your your conscience offends you or your conscience is telling you you shouldn't be doing this you actually are doing something your conscience is saying wait a minute like he's not acting with his conscience he's acting against it and against the gospel so when paul invokes the gospel he says hey they're hypocritical and not walking uprightly he's looking at a word principle according to the gospel and so i just to try to convey this as you read it i find that there's a lot in this that you read over it and i don't really have the time to read the other places to fully amplify it but peter ate with the gentiles when he was with the gentiles and when he was with the gentiles he ate with them not according to jewish customs so he ate whatever was served so here's peter eating things that and eating with gentiles so he's acting in a way that a true jew wouldn't have he wouldn't even sat down to be with him or in their house or he wouldn't have eaten their food there's a lot of different ways that maybe peter was taking liberty and what he was expressing is that i am free in christ no longer bound under the law therefore it does not condemn my conscience nor am i guilty of the law to eat with the gentiles to sit in their home and to eat these things offered by the gentiles i'm free in christ so here's peter away from all his jewish buddies away from jerusalem hanging out with the gentiles and it's like almost as what happens in vegas stays in vegas when in rome do as the romans because then when he comes back around or when the jews come around he starts actingly different acting differently but not acting differently for the right reasons it wasn't peter saying ooh i've got to be razor sharp here because i need to convince these jews i need to i want to win these jews no these jews were believers but yeah they wanted to mix in judaic tradition with christianity and bring bondage as it related to the the liberty and christ and the bible is telling us that he was afraid he was fearful of them that were of the circumcision he was fear he feared and felt the peer pressure from the brothers from jerusalem and because he feels this peer pressure from these other guys in the message or these other people neither sensitivities or not their sensitivities but their i know i wanted to say proclivity but that could be your word for the day uh uh uh what the you know their agenda and their slant or their spin he's real sensitive to it and he gets caught up in their cause and then when he does that he draws others into his hypocrisy sweeps up some of these other jews christians now and barnabas oh this is my sidekick this is my co-pastor this is this is my right hand man and he even got swept of it when he ought to know better and paul's rebuke is why compel the jews to to gentiles to live as jews in order to enjoy the full christian rights and it was compelling them why compel the gentiles to live as a jew in order to take communion when you peter being a jew felt you were free to live as a gentile this was a burn i mean immediately after this the melody was applied because he really he really gets them now you're going to compel gentiles to live as jews in order to take the communion but you've testified and represented that in christ you were free to live as a gentile now i'm not going to get caught up in the argument and be pro-peter or pro-paul but this shows there's a time for boldness it shows there's a time when there's it's necessary to have plainness of speech this was a rebuke by paul the same one who said i became all things to all men that the gospel might succeed and i might win others to christ here was a scenario where peter knew better and confessed differently these other jewish better brothers were in a different category confessing maybe taking the message and twisting it just a little bit it was a different approach in that context of brethren in fellowship together to where he wasn't just to push over and had to keep his mouth shut because i'm an ambassador for christ and brother aaron said we can't say anything no i'm talking about being balanced in the true liberty of christ and using discernment so that you can be effective because paul in his principle of being an ambassador for christ and being in christ's dead he says that writing to the corinthians who knew full well paul knew how to write a diss track right i mean his first corinthians let him have it and he told him hey this is this is what you've been doing wrong and this is how you failed and this is what you got to do to clean it up even to where afterwards paul felt like whoa i came on real strong hey i hope everything's okay i don't really need to apologize for what i said but i want to condescend myself a little bit to you to let you know that i love you and i'm your brother and we did this for the sake of the gospel for your own benefit for the one that was sinning and i feel that everything's been done so i don't feel like any anything's wrong between us but paul wrote this letter this letter of rebuke to the corinthians why because in christ's stead in in the context of relationship there's going to be times that you need to speak and it is because of these times that we don't want to diminish our voice it is because of those times we do not want our voice to be ineffective because i am going to have to speak as the final voice i am going to have to rebuke i am going to need to correct there's going to be times where i need to use discernment and as it were i'm going to have to be in christ's dead not uh not be insensitive to not promote provoke someone's agitation but to be sensitive to the cause of christ to say this is what the word of god says now's the time to speak and when it comes time to speak we do not want to have diminished the capacity of our voice to be effective because we're always yapping we always got something to say we always got our two cents we always got something we can weigh in on an opinion we can give and if you want to say wow brother aaron how can you be so suspiciously specific i've lived my life i don't know what kind of person i am i i know i know how i i i have a cringe moment every every day of every week when i just think about my past oh in my recent past like man well you really just felt like everyone needed to know that and i did was it really necessary that you weigh in on well really what this is and can i can i just have a moment of confession you guys are going to laugh at this all right pause the stream after wednesday night service get this we're just family here right should i come should i walk out in front of the pulpit so i'm just this isn't this is an act of confession after wednesday night service i went home and i debated economic policy with my family for an hour i'm quoting fisher ames and the federalist papers and we're arguing about what the strength of the the 13 colonies was and what we're debating economic policy as a family just after i preached for an hour and a half right on not doing that so it has been forever since my first confession these are my sins and uh forgive me and pray for me i never had a priest applaud a confession before but so if i if i seem to have kind of a real beat on the nature of this i don't have to go any further than my own example to realize that there's a lot of ways we can give voice to certain things that when it comes time to speak they think this is just another instance where this person's wanting to weigh in on something now if you look at galatians chapter 2 i think we're already there so this wouldn't be too hard to do this but now look at the other side of this or the kind of the thing that started this conversation with peter different circumstances can require a different approach but what i want you to recognize is that the goal is always the same and these are scriptural examples of how actions were inspired by what was best to promote the gospel in other words what was done in this circumstance was done with the idea that we're doing this for christ we're doing this for the benefit of the lost we're doing this that we might in some way intervene in this situation and act as an intermediary of the gospel so a person can be saved and in galatians chapter 2 verses 1 to 5 we were just reading in 11 to 14 and this is kind of the preface to that but notice the subject matter then 14 years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and this is where barnabas got you know hanging out with peter and got uh gave into peer pressure he took titus i took titus with me also and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preached among the gentiles but privately to them which were reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain and this was a very humble move on his part that i went and i met with elders i met with those of reputation and i shared with them privately what i'd been doing with the gentiles so as to share it with them so that they could share in their hearts whether it bore witness with their spirit and he says notice this now in verse three but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised so he shows up with the jews and uh when i say it he shows i'm gonna move on actually brother joel sent me a picture of the day and it was a picture of a leather jacket and on the back of the leather jacket it said uh a fellow of the bait a lewd fellow of the baser sword was the this was on the back of the jacket i was like well we'll probably find him at jason's house later and uh and so i was thinking of just the crew right so the paul comes back with with the uh a greek titus and he's hanging out with his jewish brethren who would be of the circumcision and we're wrestling with these ideas that if these gentiles are going to partake in christian communion should they adopt our circumcision should they adopt our policies as jews but he says titus wasn't compelled to be circumcised because after paul expressed how the gospel was being affected with the gentiles the jews then do not compel him to be circumcised he says and that because the false brethren unawares brought in who came in privileged to spy out our liberty which we have in christ that they might bring us in into bondage so he's saying look listen paul titus was not circumcised because any effort to circumcise him would would be for the cause of bringing us back into bondage it'd be to make a point oh you brought this uncircumcised greek into here we need to circumcise them but it's false brethren who are promoting this message within the church or within the believers saying oh well you need to circumcise them can you do this you need to do that he can't really be a true believer unless he's done this and paul said they're kind of trying to take the liberty which we have in christ and bring him into bondage he says to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour in other words i didn't give them any time i told him no i don't want to hear from you that the truth of the gospel might continue with you why did paul in this instance not force titus to be circumcised because the emphasis or the attempt was for the wrong motives and objectives but then also paul in withstanding it did so so that the truth of the gospel might continue so here's an instance where paul says no you're not going to circumcise titus and he makes his stand and withstands them and titus is not compelled to be circumcised and paul cites the liberty of christ he cites the cause of christ and that the gospel might continue but in acts chapter 16 verses 1 to 5. this will be a very quick reading then came he to derby and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewish and believed but his father was a greek so a jewish mother married a greek man so they have a son who is in a mixed a faith home and we understand the testimony of his grandmother lois who converts the daughter then timothy gets converted but it says which was well reported of by the brethren that where we're at lystra and iconium these are all cities in galatia he says him would paul have to go forth with him so here's another greek timothy he's going to go with paul but notice what paul says and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters what titus doesn't have to be circumcised and then but james or timothy does could you imagine what timothy said later wait what huh you're a what and it seems like it's the same audience titus didn't have to because jews wanted him to but now timothy has been circumcised because of jews that are in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek and as though and as they but then this is the point here i'm getting getting ahead of myself so timothy is circumcised because of jews titus is not circumcised because of jews i think you already recognized the difference the jews were wanting him to in order that he would align with this kind of hybrid faith within the message but now timothy is circumcised because of jews but now these aren't necessarily converted jews these are jews that they want the gospel to have effective witness with and they don't want the fact that here's timothy uncircumcised preaching to jews the gospel and what are they going to say i'm going to listen to you why would we listen to you you haven't even accepted you're not even a jew why would i accept the gospel from you fulfilling our prophecies the messiah to israel the redeemer that was to come as prophesied by isaiah and is spoken of by david and you're a greek uncircumcised yeah you really believe this gospel yeah you really are an ardent follower and maybe just kind of vamping a little bit on how they would have acted and ad-libbing a little bit on the conversation but paul recognizing the uniqueness of the dynamics has timothy to be circumcised and then it says as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily to all those new christians that were jews and to anyone that would be converted and in particular as paul is even relating to here i hope that wasn't lost in the in the ad-libbing new converts to christ who were jews could be sensitive to a gentile telling them what to do so then timothy becomes one who is fully converted in their eyes right apostle like to the jewish faith who's now preaching the gospel so in this instance an opposite approach is required then when titus came to jerusalem so what may be wrong under one set of circumstances may be right under another but what was the primary concern what was the deciding factor in each one of these instances that the truth of the gospel might continue on that churches be established in the faith it was the effectiveness of the gospel that determined in a matter which was indifferent you weren't going to be a sinner if you were circumcised you certainly weren't going to be a sinner if you remained uncircumcised but yet a sacrifice was required in each one of these instances something needed to be specifically done and it and and kind of the the the the modus operandi or the thing that was offered in the back of the minds that motivated them to do what they were doing was how can we be the most effective witness to our audience how can we achieve salvation how can we stand for truth how is it i need to act in this situation and become something to my audience so that they will hear what i have to say how can and it's not to say ingratiating yourself or or or being sly or slick or being a good salesman but it's avoiding unnecessary distractions or contentions so that the truth the real truth can be advocated for it would have been wrong to die on the mountain of circumcision with timothy and you show up with timothy and somebody objects and the argument is all about well you're trying to make this man you're trying to bring this defiled greek and dartmouth who's uncircumcised and then paul wants to blast them oh you're really not free in christ you're really not believers because if you were you wouldn't judge him and you would just let it go and this big blow up happen he says you know what i got i got a way that we can just get right past this i'll just agree we'll just go along with it but then he recognizes in jerusalem no this is this is this is turning now this isn't something be established this isn't a way to promote the health of the gospel and see that churches are established now i'm in jerusalem with people who should know better and there's these brothers that are trying to spy out our liberty trying to bring us back into bondage and there's a movement that's coming up and paul's saying no wait a minute wait a minute we're not going there because you could say well brother aaron in your last few services maybe you should have taken a page from your own sermon and not said the things you said no i think there's a time to speak so the guiding principle was the promotion of the gospel and that should be the guiding principle of our actions this this is a guiding principle of our interactions and yes i'm primarily speaking about uh maybe interactions with people that we don't have a daily intimate relationship with but this thing would not only relate to interactions with unbelievers but it guides the relationships we have among ourselves how am i promoting the effectiveness of the gospel in your life brother how am i promoting the effectiveness of the gospel in your life son or daughter this is something that we ought to think about is we keep in mind our this is this is guiding us in terms of our voice what we say our word our actions what we do our example this is our advocacy for christ in romans chapter 14 you find that i when i was looking at it yesterday i was like i want to read the whole thing and it's about christian liberty and as you read it's kind of like won't won't it just seems to be this thing going over here you know him that is weak in the face receiving without doubting one that believes may eat all things and one who's weak and it just keeps it's almost like he's just saying you know why judge this and one who esteems another day over another you know every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he's just treading down this path but then he comes to verse 13 let us not therefore judge one another anymore let's just not judge anyone each other anymore in these different things let's just not judge one another anymore and he says but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way what uh what profound words this is very very good that i'm going to ask myself in my christian liberty because paul was saying we have this christian liberty and then he begins to talk about her accountability but he's saying i have this christian liberty but as a christian as i exercise my liberty there is accountability for the way that i behave with this liberty as paul pointed out in first corinthians yeah all things are lawful all things uh um i can do there's no law against these things but is it all expedient to benefit somebody else because remember the context for even that statement it didn't relate necessarily alone to his own perfection but the effectiveness of his witness and the gospel upon others there's a lot of things i can do but i won't do them so that the gospel of christ can be promoted in its purity that'll cause confusion i don't pursue my own ideas and do the things that i want to and he said now let's not judge anybody anymore but judge ourselves and judge this rather that in my eating and in my drinking am i living in my acting in my going in all my recreation and everything i say and do i don't want to put a stumbling block in front of another person or an occasion to fall in a brother's way these are very big words to be a stumbling block to be an occasion to fall it's a language that is akin of those that would commit the worst travesties and if anything fall in line with what satan's agenda is therefore we can challenge ourselves we can say well i can dress this way this is there's just a bunch of legalists out there and i can dress this way and i can listen to this and i can listen to that and i can ingest this and i can recreate with that and i can do all these different things and yeah maybe there could be a well-reasoned argument as to why you have liberty and christ to dilly dally venture in enjoy cherry pick or do all these different things but you have to ask yourself as an individual question a christian within the context of your home and your relationship with other believers and then as a testimony of the community as a whole what would happen one day if these very co-workers that you've been doing these things with one of them said i don't know what i'm going to do i feel lost and i want to know that there's a god and all of a sudden you got to go um [Music] you want to talk about jesus i'm like oh i didn't know you i didn't know you were a christian oh no no i'm crazy i'm crazy christian man i'm radical i'm a kind of believer a lot of people think i'm in a cult you should hear what i have to say you're like uh is that the drugs talking i'm being i'm being very serious about this we should ask ourselves could this cause my son to stumble could this cause my wife's faith to weaken could this be the wrong example to another young person could someone see my liberty in christ and actually come under bondage that's what he's saying you're just exercising your liberty and you're literally walking in a path and you're not you're not stumbling you're not following but someone's trying to walk the same way you are and they just keep tripping and they keep stumbling like what's wrong with you man that's well i'm just trying to i'm just trying to follow where you're walking and it can cause another another to stumble but yet your feet aren't hindered and paul is saying watch your steps and ask yourself whether your conduct or your behavior your words your actions the things you advocate for the things that you do cause another to stumble it says in colossians chapter four verses five to six i think this scripture perfectly encapsulates it walk in wisdom towards them that are without he's actually speaking about christians excuse me he's not speaking about those who do not have wisdom but rather speaking of our relationships with non-christians walk in wisdom towards those that are without the body have not been baptized into christ redeeming the time making the very most of the time seizing buying up season up buying up every opportunity so he says let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to give ought to answer every man to me that is that is the apologetics that when there's a need there's a question you'll know how to answer it not theologically not precisely in terms of what the original intent was and what the context is and and what the doctor might be but you have a sensitivity to be able to speak at the right time and have speech that has been seasoned with grace to where they hear is benefited by it and like oh yes this is i i understand and this is it's ministering grace as the scripture says you're going to speak in such a way toward ministers grace to the here he said let your conversation let your life be gracious and and let it be sensible walk in wisdom towards those with towards them that are without let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt let your voice be with grace always let your voice be seasoned be tempered by grace because you're going to use it to give an answer someone's going to ask you a question and that same mouth you've been using to run down something else maybe the same mouth you're going to use to try to stand for christ the same mouth you've been using to advocate for a certain brand of economics by the founding fathers the same math you're going to use to try to instruct your children and well i don't even agree with your economic policy why would i agree with your standards in the home elliot didn't say that was it jack no it was none let's not waste our words on rhetoric let's not waste our speech on things that are extreme or vain causes save them for the opportunity that matters save them so that you may know how you ought to answer every man there's a lot of different things that can get us agitated and aggravated and caustic attitudes and divisive opinions on in different matters where we get really corrosive and agitated and we have this caustic attitude and we have divisive opinions on certain things on things that don't really matter what it does is it makes it sterilizes your testimony in that if there's no seed that's being sown christ is saying nope i can't go in that i i can't be a part of that it's you're not going to be effective so we actually hinder the ability of our words really finding fertile ground and affecting change in someone's life when we it's sewn with all this agitation and this religious fervor in the wrong sense and in political uh demagoguery toward oh we're just ratcheted up about certain things we want the message of christ to be pure we don't want to handle it in unrighteousness remember we are advocates for the cause of christ and our lives we want our lives to be forcible arguments brother brahm says this and the message humble thyself i think it just ties into let's walk into wisdom towards those that are lost he said now it's time for my consecration to god god's time to speak to me i must i must just have a little change in my own life not as i think that i'm wicked but i want to feel a little more closer to the people the people that i've tried to tell this gospel truth to and they turn their backs on it all right i want everybody's attention notice who he's talking about not necessarily new ground but people he's spoken to who have heard him who ought to have known who ought to have walked in it he says and they walk away and laugh at it here's his honesty now to me that seems like an it's an insult i don't care to me but to the things i've been saying it's the truth trying to help them like shoving out a boat and say here hey here it is here it is cross over here get out of that swelling stream you're going to die you're going to perish there and they just laugh at you and walk away it's like presenting an opportunity for someone to be saved from a flood and they laugh at you and walk away so that's how it makes you feel he goes well to me it feels like if they walk away there's nothing more i can do about it that i can do fine you want to reject it you want to laugh at it you want to scoff at it fine but notice he says but i want to run down the bank now and persuade them come on back see i've got to have that feeling because i know that there's somebody out there that hasn't come in yet and i'm going to fish chill he said until the last fish is caught i want to do that recognize that brother branham realized that it merely wasn't an opportunity we're saying hey there's a flood coming and he has a boat that's gonna save people and they reject the boat he's like fine you're gonna have to deal with it yourself you're gonna have to deal with the floodwaters you're gonna have to figure out another way across and this was just a matter of people uh foregoing an opportunity to to get across the other side of the stream brother branham realized he had a very important message i mean you recognize there wasn't going to be another one there's not another christ there's not another gospel and if they walk away from this that's their only hope so as they walked away he wasn't like oh well if they can't use this crossing maybe they can use another hit something compelled him to say i want to run after them and persuade them to come back i've got to have a feeling he was impressed with the urgency and the magnitude and the importance of the message that he had he's like there's no other way across so i want to yell to them come back this is the way let me join that with this disposition and character of paul that we've been lifting up because brother bam said he preached the same gospel paul preached paul had a revelation of jesus christ to bring to the people this revelation of jesus christ was new this revelation of jesus christ was different this revelation of jesus christ was very controversial even amongst the disciples themselves paul was preaching a revelation that peter said hey these things are difficult people rest with them unstable men rest with them to their own destruction but paul was preaching the amplification of christ saying upon this rock i will build my church and paul has the revelation of jesus christ the body of christ and he's bringing this out very forcefully and he knows he has a very very important message not only to the jews to whom the messiah was sent to call them into christianity to call them into the new covenant but also to go to the heathen who seemly were not part of that he had a very important gospel and revelation to preach and therefore it was that revelation that constrained him from acting in a manner that would cause that revelation to be ineffective wasn't even just trying to be a good christian it was the magnitude of the gospel that he held as brother branham says and humble thyself in july of 1963 after the opening of these seals soon preaching christ is the mystery god revealed it wasn't like you want to say hey what's been done has been done all these people that rejected me since 47 or since 33 the half forget them let's just move on it doesn't really matter he realized now this is totally different this has changed this is important i've got a message that's been different than what i preached before this is the fulfillment of visions and dreams this is the fulfillment of prophecy and i want to run back down the bank again i want to call out to those people you may have rejected me in the 50s you may have rejected the first poll you may have rejected the second poll but all maybe some way by god's grace the third paul will get your attention and i say that we have a message a fulfillment of end time prophecy we have something great like as paul did we have this very message that brother man said i've got to have that feeling for the people that i want them to get this message we ought to always bear this in mind so that we don't bring any hindrance to this truth first timothy chapter 2. we read this on wednesday i want to read it again and not spend a lot of time amplifying it first timothy chapter 2 verses 1 to 8. let's read it together not that you need to read out loud but let's just read it as we have it on slides or you read in your bible follow with with i feel that i can just read this with the foundation that we have to this point and just read it notice paul's attitude as he instructs timothy i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men you'll find in the book of ezra in the book i believe jeremiah where when the children were in bondage carried away captives in foreign lands they prayed for their leaders and they offered sacrifices even though they're in captivity they met together and prayed for their leaves they didn't conspire a coup they just met and prayed for their leaders this is the demonstration in the old testament that they were in bondage and they accepted the fact that they were in bondage and so they prayed supplications prayers and intercessions and given to thanks were made for these leaders and paul is now saying it should be made for all men you want to qualify that all men for kings and for all that are in authority and that comports with the examples in ezra and jeremiah now this is why one reason why you pray that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty if you if you want america to to have an environment or an atmosphere that allows you to live godly and in all honesty which should be the standard by which you want to live i want an atmosphere i want i want to be able to serve god i want to be able to serve christ i i'm not actually necessarily concerned about whether or not my college education is be paid for by the government it's not my primary concern as a christian but my concern is that will i be able to lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty and that's my primary prayer request my prayer request says oh god give us a president lord convert kamala harris uh so that she can become a republican and then have sleepy joe die so that we can have a christian president again and she can advocate for my first amendment my second amendment and that we won't have universal health care and we can close our borders and we'll just pray oh god please give me give me a republican president again god just let me live a quiet and peaceable life and all godliness and honesty and when i read this scripture i found out everything in the world today is to rob us of that not to take away our guns and give us free health care but it's to keep us from leading a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior then notice this why are we doing all this prayer and intercessions and supplications and giving thanks who will have all men to be saved and to come into the knowledge of the truth right there to me that kind of summer that's advocacy this is a call to advocacy this is standing up for the cause of christ that we as christians pray for all men we pray for those in power not so that one we could live a godly life and live what we believe to be the truth but that also others could come to the knowledge of it and then notice the fount notice what this leads to to me this is so important because we use this a lot on the bride's advocate for there is one god in one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who is that if we sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous who is a be made to be a perpetuation for our sins perpetuation mercy seat the the offering so now verses one two three and four lead to this one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom so he's the ransom he's the price he's the sacrifice there's only a ransom only needs to be paid once for all to be testified in due time so the ransom is paid but there's got to be a testimony of it he says whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in christ and lie not i am ordained a preacher and an apostle a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity truth and faith and verity i will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting again this is the summation of paul's call to advocacy this is paul not only espousing this to timothy who would be a pastor in the church and was a student of paul's to continue on the message of the hour and that day but now he is saying that this is what we ought to do i exhort first that all offer prayers and supplications intercessions and giving of thanks be made notice intercessions be made for all men even for leaders and those who are in the government because we have one mediator jesus christ the righteous one mediator between god and man but i am ordained to testify of this therefore under this ordination i will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting now he wants those to join him in this ordination and then this cause oh i i would it may be there's a part of me i don't think it's my better part uh wanted me to stop here but i want to just take another step further to be able to come back to our text but i want to be able to draw some things very very quickly we've just been past an hour in preaching uh this morning and i want to draw to this very very quickly and and draw from i think it's been nine services on this advocacy the bride's advocate where we talked about the old testament and paul in the book of hebrews showing just how beautifully we've entered into the holiest of holies we've entered in behind that curtain we're there between the cherubim right paul made that very very clear that completely changes the fact that in their in the ark of the covenant there were tablets of stone that were a witness and a testimony against israel but now under the new covenant we are back in the same place with the word in us written in our hearts now not testifying against us but testifying for us that we have been covered with the blood the ransom has been paid now there we are in the midst of this ark of the covenant there raised up seated in heavenly places we've become a part of the picture of the mercy seat and he says this now after he is given this is advocacy pray pray pray intercede intercessions would be made for kings and all that are in authority that one we could live as christians number two that others would come to the knowledge of the truth he says there's one mediator or one mediation and paul says that he's ordained as a minister of that mediation and these verses verses one two three and four even verse eight exemplify that mediation what is it primarily an advocate of christ for those who need him that could be the lost it could be the hurting it could be the wound it could be the word it could be the disappointed it could be the downtrodden those that are going to be backslid a little bit cold he is there as an advocate for christ for those who need them he's saying there's only one mediator paul saying now i have this office and i have this necessary calling i i love how he says i am a preacher apostle teacher and he says i speak the truth and i'm not lying i'm a preacher apostle and teacher to the gentiles and he's and he says this after he says there's only one media between god and man why you say now i don't want you to confuse my office because it's going to be so close you can make the wrong conclusions i'm not here to pay the price i'm not here as the one that's going to shed his blood the price has been paid there's only one mediator but i'm ordained a preacher apostle and teacher of this mediator why because he says in the stead of christ or in the place of christ he is declaring here be ye reconciled to god there's only one meter between god and man the man christ jesus an advocate with the father but he says now i stand here in the place of christ saying come and be filled come and be reconciled so let me read this very quickly first corinthians chapter 5 verse 18 then i want to come to the whole and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation that could have been translated to the ministry of atonement now we are not the atonement thank god right that we are not the atonement we are not the atonement being the sin offering we are not the offering for sin but we've been made a part of it right i mean i i don't really think it's semantics and it's not that we always you know try to go to logic but there's something there's something that god is trying to get us to understand that christ we can we cannot take the individual place of jesus christ who became the sin offering we cannot do that so we cannot be the one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus we cannot be the actual sin offering or atonement but now in the place of it or instead of it it was to be testified in due time i say it's due time to testify of it and he is not here speaking unless we speak we are the voice of the atonement we are the voice of the mercy seat we are the voice of the minister of reconciliation we name may not be the sin offering but we are the voice of it because the blood speaks we drew on these images and types before in the first several parts or first few parts in the old testament the mercy seat was literally could be have described it was described in the hebrew language the place of atonement that that that lid that that covered that the the ark of the covenant that became an altar all these elements becoming part of the same thing that was sprinkled with blood on the day of atonement and it atoned and reconciled atonement even there it's not just a uh i i want you to catch this what paul is bringing in i may be just i'm getting all excited and all enthused i just need to take a deep breath slow down i'm getting worked up in the old testament the mercy seats the place of atonement or the place of reconciling paul is not just using oh yeah what you know what's the word he's not doing a crossword puzzle you know what's a 11 letter word for something he's he's actually very deliberate in what he says so that on the day of atonement what would happen on the day of atonement the high priest would enter in behind that and take the sin offering and he'd put those stripes the blood upon the mercy seat in the hebrew atonement is reconciling it's the same thing in the new testament the minister of reconciliation could have been the ministry of atonement but now he said on the day of atonement we look in the old testament on the day of reconciling the mercy seat was sprinkled with blood so when paul says we have it's been committed to us a ministry of reconciliation the bride has a ministry of reconciliation she has a ministry of atonement away to the mercy seat as i try to bring this to a close this is the bride's advocacy now in my heart i feel that i could stop on the bride's advocacy the lord may just have me stop in this series right here on this because i believe it convey it comes to the point the original inspiration in this this is our responsibility and the final voice to the final age it's seen in this image it's seen in first timothy chapter two it's seen in first john chapter two it's seen in these in these places in the bible that we've been reading from over the last several weeks so let's look at our text one last time as we read this just reading it together we'll invite the musicians to come therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god now we are the new creatures we are those that have all things have become new so now our lives are changing things are different and he says god has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ so we have been reconciled to god by jesus christ but all things have become new he says and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation so it's only through christ that we can be reconciled to god but now in order for there to be further reconciliation we've been given the ministry of reconciliation to it notice this how beautiful this that god was in christ reconcile the world unto himself are we not taught that that all that god was he poured into christ and then the scriptures tell us about how christ is emptied out all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he is poured into the church and god was in christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses on them and have committed unto us now the word of reconciliation this is what jesus christ has done god was in christ recklen signed the world to himself and now it has been committed to us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you as if christ is present with you in the place of christ the one whom god was in reconciling the world to himself in christ said be ye reconciled to god it's speaking the same thing we have made him to be sin for us who knew no sin the sin offering who was perfect right those the images when paul says this he made him to be sin for us he knew no sin it's the very image on the day of atonement where one animal this beast would be taken and these sins would be he would be hacked it would be cut open and he would bleed out as a sin offering [Music] and he would take on an image it was a symbol of god reconciling israel to himself and he said he became sin for us he knew no sin he was innocent so that we not merely would we have a symbolic representation of god placating our sins for a year but that we through one offering and descending back of that spirit would be made the very righteousness of god in him [Music] therefore being righteous being sprinkled being washed being made clean we can boldly enter into this office in this position in the holy of holies and we have a voice we're not walking around the outside of the tabernacle i wonder what's happening in there i wonder if the cloud's going to come down this year i wonder if the high priest is going to be accepted we're not the ones walking around wondering we're not even in the outer court we're not even in the inner court we're in the holy of holies and there we know the presence of christ is real there we know the gravity of the hour it's there that we stand we are they're raised seated in heavenly places in christ jesus do we not have a voice from behind that veil a voice from behind the veil of badger skins today the unveiling of god how is he unveiled in this house it's going to be by a living voice by a testimony i want to be a true advocate for the presence of jesus christ in this hour we have a precious revelation that's been given to us oh let me not sow it let me not bring smut upon it let me not confuse it but let it be declared clearly we have a message and in the message investments [Music] the message investments brother brown says in our spirits this morning weep out for a lost world [Music] we may need we may need to get back to this our spirits are weeping for a lost world give us wisdom to know how to approach them lord we don't want them lost the bear the very excuse me the very spirit within us would condemn us desiring their being lost [Music] if you wanted people to be lost if you wanted to be destroyed if you wanted them to be cast into tribulation then the brother branham saying that the very spirit within us would condemn us if we had that desire he says but may the holy spirit constantly cry they say constantly sweep out until we put forth every effort with our talent with our time with our money with everything that we have got no matter how little it is we offer it to you oh everybody please hear the sound of my voice today this is our advocacy and i'm not advocating for some baptist picture of jesus christ i'm not advocating for some evangelical picture of jesus christ i'm advocating for the revelation of jesus christ in this hour notice what he says help us lord to take this great message to a dying world i love this i have very little lord that i can offer no ability no personality no nothing can we all say man just accept it that's me no ability no personality no nothing but say this but i just got my soul lord my voice and it's all yours see i've got a show lord and i got my voice and it's all yours isn't that beautiful oh it's wonderful the day that he sealed your soul through the baptism of the holy ghost but now lord you have my voice and this voice is all yours i'm gonna i'm gonna shed labels i'm gonna i'm gonna get out of groups i'm gonna change my subscriptions i'm gonna change my giving patterns i'm gonna change the way i've been living my life the way i've been advocating the way i've been caught up in things because i want to put forth every talent my time my money everything i got no matter how little it is either if there's no ability or personality or nothing i've got a soul that i've given to christ and i've got a voice it's all yours it's all yours it's all yours with our heads bowed it's all yours oh hallelujah there is only one mediator the bride will never take that place but we are ordained to testify of it because it's due time i invite you to stand and say lord here's my soul here's my voice it's all yours here's my soul here's my voice it's all yours our gracious heavenly father lord i believe the word is enough and i believe your people are receiving it and that suffices so i pray lord as we've had these this even these last two statements we've read from the message of brother branham's urgency of running up and down the bank recognizing and the message humbled myself just the magnitude of the word that had been opened up to him [Music] now lord with this statement resonating within our hearts we say lord i don't have much to give you but here's my soul use my voice it's all yours we committed to you father today i pray that you bless your people encourage them give them strength lord i pray for brother daniel evans who's traveling back to jeffersonville lord wrapping up family affairs to move his wife relocating to tucson permanently we pray for his children lord his son in college there back east this great decision we pray that you bless him lord we think of him today while he's traveling we think of brother jared at home six sister carolyn out of precaution lord her mother and sister being tested positive for covet and her being a nurse and being in contact lord who just pray that you bless them lord i believe these are just there's a sensitivity lord that we want to have for others that our minds are drawn to those who are seeking truth and desiring freedom and liberty lord for sister arnie today i pray that you just take that blood pressure now and by the power of the living god bring that back down to normal lord she's a strong daughter of god may you give her faith to accept you at your word and walk in healing and wellness of body lord we love you we praise you we just exalt your name there's not enough words that we could pour out from these lips that would adequately do your justice do you justice but lord we stand in all today to see the word unfold and to see this advocacy that paul is pointing to and then for just to turn to realize this is paul not as soft sewer and or paul trying to placate and paul trying to be acceptable or popular but he knew that he was standing in the very place of christ and we today as the bride of jesus christ had the ministry of atonement lord how could we ever disregard the blood of jesus christ as an unholy thing how could we ever discard it and do away with it to not be moved and impacted by it when we are the very voice of the blood in this hour we are the very voice of the atonement i pray for that you would help us to be more sensitive and to walk in the proper reflection of it here's our soul here's our voice we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
