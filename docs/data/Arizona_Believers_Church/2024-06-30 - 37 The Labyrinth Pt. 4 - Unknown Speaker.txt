TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is our 37th service on the house of the Lord I know you're all keeping count so you're already right there with us uh this is part four on the Labyrinth I feel that there's um just something that we may be clenching down today that will um help us to maybe move on to some of these other things that the Lord has dealt with us in our hearts but this subject of the labyrinth fits in with what my burden was and how the Lord's been dealing with me on the house of the Lord how it applies to us as individuals applies to our homes it applies to us as a church and so there's a lot of ways that you can make this practical there's a lot of ways that you can uh take certain principles even in this thought and apply them to your personal lives uh your home life it's certainly a direction to us as a church and there's a lot of things that will mention today that we've mentioned before and I'd like to point out that if you're able to uh look back you'll see that there's a lot of themes that we've been covering through these many services that are surfacing today so this is built on a pretty large foundation and especially Wednesday night uh we didn't take a long time but we went through certain things just showing what Simplicity meant and how that in the garden it was this Simplicity that the devil corrupted we'll come to that for a little bit and expound on it a little bit deeper and how that Temptations those Temptations in the garden and then with Jesus Christ in the wilderness uh were right there together that they were uh kind of overlapping with one another and now in 2 Corinthians we've just read it and Paul is saying if you'll just bear with me well let me just uh clarify very quickly on one thing because I don't know if we'll we won't be reading through some of these statements but on the Labyrinth when we use that term the Labyrinth it's we're using it as brother brandham used it in the church age book when he was writing com from commus is uh one thing needful or one thing necessary and and he uses the term Labyrinth we'll read it here in just a moment uh from that book but or from the one thing necessary but he uses this term and how he goes over this page and a half he's talking about a mass of confusion uh people the politics and the fighting and the Really pointing out the failure of Christianity how all these different voices and everyone fighting one another and uh and and Christ being left out of all of it who is the one thing necessary so when we use this term the Labyrinth uh it is it is using it in the same way that brother I believe brother brandham pointed it out in the church age book so here in 2 Corinthians chap 11 as PA is saying if you could bear with me a little in my Folly he says I'm jealous over you it's a Godly jealousy and this Godly jealousy provokes this fear so it's a Godly fear as well in the sense that he's not overcome with some evil thought he's not possessed uh with an ungodly uh emotion but rather his love has led him to have this Zeal to recognize that there's this potential for error and he uses quite a statement that as I have espoused you to Christ I would like like for you to come to this Union with him uh undefiled and pure and so he's warning of the Antichrist spirit that would that would defile the believer's mind now that we should put ourselves in that that channel that these he feared that as the serpent beguiled Eve he would defile the believer's mind so we're taking instruction from this for ourselves to recognize that yes we need to be steadfast we we we need to watch how the devil's trying to defile our own mind we read in Galatians chap 1 how that uh Paul writes and he warns of uh Christ being perverted the word of Christ being perverted and how that in perverting Christ it would defile the church and we're find we see he speaks of that in Galatians chapter 1 and he writes this in the church age book and we can find this in John's letters as well but he writes now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts right if it's not the true church it can't be a continuation of the book of Acts if it's not Christ in the true church it can't be a continuation of the book of Acts so if you are the true church unless it's Christ in you it can't be a continuation of the book of Acts what we can be tempted to do as a true church is write her own book and called the acts of the true church when in fact the acts of the the true church in the beginning was the acts of the Holy Spirit through the Believers and in in the true church so there's so much that goes in this right in another book of Acts and it's not just that we would do the same things they did but it would be the Holy Spirit acting through US Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but what's the barrier to this continuation of the book of Acts The Book of Revelation shows how the that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless so the Antichrist Spirit desires to defile and to defile scripturally at least in the New Testament with the Greek word and kind of the the Jewish idea of defilement is anything to the slightest degree that God requires perfection in worship and there were certain details that needed to be observed and so defilement especially if you look at it in the context of the law was just to the slightest degree there wasn't this spectrum to say well that's that's not right that's not right but now it's officially wrong it's that in the slightest degree so Satan is looking to defile Us in the slightest degree and the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist spirit is Desiring to defile the church and make it lukewarm formal and Powerless amen a and that's to to defile the our minds corrupt our minds and the Simplicity that is in Christ so that Christ cannot have the preeminence in the true church and continue his work in the Believers as we would recognize that's what the continuation of the book of Acts would be brother bham draws from this statement from comenius and his Unum necessarium he says in short all the things of Christians have become a labyrinth so as the Antichrist Spirit and the Book of Revelation warned it begins to work within the church and now we get to the 17th century and sure enough all of Christianity the things of Christians have become a maze elaborate a dungeon a a wondering mess to where you end up in death faith has been cut up into a thousand of minute articles faith has been distilled down to laws and cannons and all sorts of of rules and regulations and If you deny one of these you are a heretic now certainly we can see that this is so with the Catholic church and as this begins to permeate amongst the daughters that they had their their Cannon their catechism the things that they believed to be uh the way that things should be done and it didn't necessarily have to have root in scripture but they had come under this uh spirit to say this is what we believe and If you deny anything that we believe you're a heretic and if we look at it historically I think I just almost did the Trump accordion if you look at it historically it's why you shouldn't watch debates if you look at it if you look at it historically you'll find that the church actually if they considered you a heretic they would just kill you and so this is what um one of the things comenius is looking at in short all things of Christians have become elaborate faith has been cut up in a bunch of things that you have to accept or you become a her heretic then it becomes more than just religion or going to church on Sunday life has been divided into a thousand matters of conscience and if you don't keep all of these your Scruples are questioned they there's doubt about your experience they want to uh provoke questions in your mind or provoke doubt that if you don't keep all of these thousands matters of conscience then you must not be a Christian you must not be a believer you must not do this you must not have that and so these are questions of doubt that arise from man-made Traditions man-made divisions it's not that uh commenius would be arguing that if one uh rejected the existence of God uh that you shouldn't question their Scruples we go to the Bible and find that only a fool would deny God that if you were to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and someone says well you know the Bible says to be baptized this way and and you're causing doubt and causing questions commenius wouldn't be trying to draw you away from obedience to the word of God he's just saying it's become something completely different than what it was intended or Christ was left out of it so brother bam says what can help only the one thing needful return to Christ looking to Christ is the only leader in walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith as the Heavenly Master Built everything on the ground of the scripture so should we leave all particularities of our special confession and be satisfied with the revealed word of God which belongs to us all so there are certain unique or peculiar uh understandings or teachings or maybe special confessions that comenius is referencing and brother brandham is quoting from that have been Christianity's been broken up into not necessarily distilled down to and reduced down to but expanded into thousands of matters of conscience thousands of minute articles a and all these things in the mind and in the conscience trying to rationalize trying to accept trying to agree with and so it the question is how do we get through this Christ Christ is the only way out of the labyrinth Christ is the only one that can can help us and so return to Christ look to Christ alone as your leader walk in his footsteps set aside all of their ways until you reach the goal and as Christ our Heavenly Master Built everything on scripture as he was when he was tempted in the wilderness we've been looking at that it is written it is written it is written he says we should leave all the particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of God which belongs to us all as it is revealed to you it's yours the word of God it we would even say this is the Inspire the Bible is the inspired word of God it's yours now Paul says as the serpent beguiled Eve in the garden he did it from and we're going to look back at this in detail he did it from the Simplicity he he beguiled Eve in the garden from the Simplicity of God and the paradise of God represented this is some just connecting back to Wednesday night it represented the liberty and and the the bountifulness uh and the Simplicity that is in Christ so Paul is saying as the serpent beguiled Eve from the Simplicity that is in Christ it's not so much just the mechanics of Deceit but rather we could go back to and look at the Garden of Eden and see that there was Simplicity that Paul was talking about even there in the garden Simplicity means it's not compounded it's not over complicated it's not needlessly complex the garden was not needlessly complex there were complexities and intricacies in in creation and it wasn't just looking at says well this is this is really uh mundane but no it was beautiful it was ordinate it was gorgeous but yet life wasn't needlessly complex notice that in the beginning God didn't give them all the laws that the Jews got right life was a lot much more simple and it wasn't compounded or over complicated Simplicity refers to folds to where something has been folded up so that it's lost its meaning or it's lost its wholeness and it can also or it is also translated to bountifulness or liberality we looked in the scriptures and saw that how Paul used this term Simplicity to say he that gives let him give in Simplicity and that there is a and your Simplicity in giving as he commended the Believers it speaks of bountifulness or liberality so Simplicity it's not that well I only gave a dollar or it wasn't uh it was very a straightforward uh transaction it just it speaks to some Liberty in a person's Spirit where they're not motivated by other factors other than the true word of God or the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and that their actions match their heart a a and their heart matches their actions and so it means they're not hypocritical in they're giving they weren't self-seeking there was this openness of heart that Paul's talking about that manifest itself in generosity where this Simplicity of you're giving now when you think think of it this way I think this will help that if someone was to give you something and I think we always find this that someone says here I want you to have this and we're like thank you I've always wanted a million dollars in cash and you're just and then if we've lived a little bit all of a sudden we go what's the catch is this fake am I on camera what's what's going on you don't it's not just simply someone trying to give you something what's in it for them and this is what economics has been reduced to that if there's something you've been offered and you're getting something in the marketplace you have to recognize that nobody's doing you a favor in you a favor alone they're probably doing themselves a favor yes you may be getting a deal but they're probably getting a better deal or it works within their scheme of trying to meet their own needs and satisfy themselves and so the Simplicity removes that from the equation to where whatever is being offered is being done in sincerity not self-seeking not a trick not a trap and this is what the Simplicity that is in Christ is where Christ isn't reduced to a maze to where you're afraid that if you walk through the wrong door you're going to fall into a trap that if you make the wrong step you're going to be banished to hell it's not that's not the way the gospel should be presented so Simplicity is this uh without pretense where there's something behind it there's there's Pride or hypocrisy it's not a mixed signal like I love you I just want you to have this only to come to find out that there was something else attached to that you're being asked of something behind that so it's not inconsistent or contradictory to what appears uh uh to be what God what that the action should be suggesting now Genesis chapter 3: 4 and 5 says and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die she said that if we God hath said it is written we can put it that way God has said that if the day that we eat of this tree we should not eat nor should we touch it because the day we eat we will die and so Satan says ye shall not surely die now there's just a direct contradiction to the word of God and had he left it at that just to say you now you won't die you you won't you won't die then she would have let's just kind of hypothesize in in this theoretical argument that if he just says you're not going to die that the conversation ends he told me I wasn't going to die uh or I was going to die you're telling me I'm not I'll just go with what God says but what the devil has to do then is he has to find some way for her to question her faith or question her Scruples or or cause some doubt and what better way to cause doubt than to question the character of the one who said you would die and how is it that he does that he says God for God does know so he's saying that God consciously told you something with the in it said something to you that God knew when he told you that you would die this is what he was thinking that in the day you eat thereof you wouldn't actually die but your eyes would be open and you would be as God's knowing good and evil so the devil not only twists the word by saying you won't die he says God doth know so he's misinterpreted the character of God he's misinterpreted the intent of God that God would say something to you and ask you to do something but in that sense he's lying he's saying that God lied to her and that God lied to her and and I want you to catch this he lied to her out of his own pretense right he lied to her out of his own Pride because he was wanting to withhold something from the woman so that she couldn't be like him so it would be one thing but God said listen uh if you eat this you're going to die and the reason you're going to die is you're going to know things you shouldn't know and things are going to happen it's going to defile things and he lays it all out there he just says the day you eat at least the way it's represented scripture and in the way that the woman answers back so I believe though some remains in symbolic form it conveys the Simplicity of God's prohibition and the woman's understanding of it and how the devil complicated it by saying no yeah whatever God lied you will not die and it's not just disagreeing with the word but now it's to question God's motivation in telling her that she would as if God was trying to keep her from something that God intentionally and with premeditation lied to her and in doing so what did it naturally do it confused her whoa whoa hold on God said if we eat it we'll die but what you're telling me is that if we do if if in this in this partaking I'll actually become more like him and it made it this confusion and who knows if it's not this thought of well maybe what he he's actually wanting me to figure this out or maybe maybe this was a test to find out if we really wanted to be like him and it all of a sudden becomes this massive confusion and one the seed had been swn into her mind it led to the act now the garden at this point had been a sanctuary it is where God dwelt with the man and the woman it was Heaven on Earth is how we've represented it and in this moment through Satan twisting the woman's mind about the intent and and the the the character of God the result in chapter 3 says in verse 23 therefore the the Lord God sent him man forth from the Garden of Eden now he's been cast out of the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man he sends them forth and then drives them out he's leaving the Garden of Eden this paradise this Sanctuary this particular place that the Bible says that he made and there he placed the man in it to work and to till and to be there with the woman and to bring forth and and to have dominion he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubs now catch this great symbols in this and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so there was a keeping of the way of the tree of life the way the life the knowledge the truth there's there's this protection and this guard uh guarding and we recognize the way of the tree of life isn't just a literal path to a literal tree that was now somehow hidden and it was a secret chamber that that you could try to you tried to find in a side quest no it's the way of the Tree of Life Christ that was was veiled there was something that dropped down and man no longer had access to the sanctuary so man is driven out of the presence of God in the garden Christ is being represented this cherubims guarding the way to keep the way of the tree of life and I'm using this word sanctuary and and I fail to recall right now just how much we might have developed this in the past and talking about the Garden of Eden but a sanctuary is a consecrated place is a place of rest a place of Refuge a place of protection and and that's what Sanctuary ought to represent we call this the sanctuary and it being the sanctuary that we want to conduct ourselves in a certain way we call it the sanctuary because we believe the presence of God visits us here should be a place of Refuge it should be a place of protection it's a consecrated place and God when he made the Earth and then made the Garden in and then place man in the Garden of Eden this paradise it was a sanctuary in which God would come down and he dwelt with his creation but now as man is driven out of the garden and there's chair bums that are there with the Flaming sword to turn away to guard to keep to keep out anyone from the way of the Tree of Life the Earth was no longer a sanctuary for the Creator and the created now with that image in mind let me connect it back to the house of the Lord we've gone through a great detail in some of the things that we've ministered on this to see that the house of the Lord represented Heaven and Earth that it was made in the image and the pattern of the Heavenly sanctuary in Exodus chapter 25:8 and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them in making of the sanctuary it was structured in a very particular way you had the outer Court you had the inner court and the holy PL uh uh the and the holy of holies and there in that holy of holies you would see this image in this uh of Heaven because now it's sealed from view then outer Court you would come in a veil and you'd have this inner court but then heaven was a veil and only one person could enter in behind that so there's this representation of Heaven and Earth and these different and this uh the creation of the temple and in that innermost room it was the the holy of holies the Oracle the holy uh the holiest of all and that was where God dwelt you remember these things and we and just from your teaching not just from here but in teaching in Exodus 25:22 it's talking about this mercy seat and this place he says and there I will meet with thee in the Oracle in the most holy place in the holiest of all in that most inner chamber there I will meet with thee this is the sanctuary where he would dwell there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I'll give thee in the Commandment unto the children of Israel notice how now we see this very image of the cherubs that were there with flaming swords to keep the way of the tree of life that place where God would have met mankind this representation of being banished from the Garden of Eden and cherums are placed there with flaming swords to keep the way of the Garden of Eden and now God represents this in the very Oracle in the most holy place in the holiest of all that between the cherubims there will his presence be his shakina will come to commune with Israel Psalms 80 ver1 says Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock oh Shepherd of Israel thou that dwelleth dwellest between the cherubims so this became now a representation of where God dwelt at one time he would have dwelt between the man and the woman in the Garden of Eden but now symbolically in this Most Holy place he would dwell between the two cherubs and the house of the Lord and its function this is again just a lot of review and its different functions and its services and its elements and its utensils the house of the Lord and all these things and those that worshiped those that sacrificed in the manner of worship and sacrifice symbolized and represented Jesus Christ in Hebrews chapter 9: 6 to 12 now when these things were thus ordained the priest went away into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second now when he says the the first Tabernacle there's your inner court but now he is your your most inner Court your holy of holies but in the second went the high priest alone once a year not without blood which he offered for himself and for The Heirs of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest the fact that only one man had the right to enter in with blood being shed and and offering for himself and the HS of the people the Holy Ghost in commanding this and doing this was signifying that the way into the hly of all was not yet made manifest it was not open it was not revealed while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing yes which was a figure what what are all these Tabernacles for what are these rooms what are these divisions what are a structure for it was a figure for the time then present it was a symbol for them at that time in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation and then so that that that's the mouthful I want would love to just be able to for it to just amplify in your mind immediately think the temple the Tabernacle the house of the Lord its worship its ordinances its Washings all those things were for a symbol for the time to come verse 11 but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come so now here the Holy Ghost once signified that the way hadn't been made but now Christ is the way he is the truth he is the life amen he is the tree of life we could say Christ become a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle than the first or the second or this layout of the house of the Lord not made with hands that is to say not of this building not of this Tabernacle nor of the Tabernacle and the Wilderness or the Temple of Solomon or Ezekiel you name it none of those temples neither by Blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into it entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us so Christ was foreshadowed and symbolized and represented in Temple worship he was he was being pointed to figured signified in all these different ways that uh uh worship was conducted in the house of the Lord the high priest the lamb the atonement all spoke of Christ it all spoke of a greater Covenant and and so there God this is uh I just feel like maybe I just placed a box and I want to step back and look at them together in the beginning the Garden of Eden was a paradise it was a sanctuary where God dwelt between the man and the woman and it was it was perfection it was God it was God's creation and then man is driven away and there's cherub bums keeping the way of the tree of life and man is thrust out into a labyrinth he's Thrust out into the world he's going to have to fend for himself and things have vastly changed and that certainly is an understatement and I was uh commented the last year at some point I was I was fat and Jack said that's an understatement and uh we've never let him live it down and what he meant was that's an overstatement but he said it's an understatement and it's lived it's it's lived he's trying to go to come to my defense and he just threw me under the bus but that may be it may be understated to say life life had vastly changed but I'm wanting you to see that now God in trying to bring the Reformation or God trying to bring Redemption and bring man back to what he had lost he starts signifying his divine presence among on his people through the Tabernacle in the wilderness and the temple or the house The Dwelling Place the sanctuary of the Lord dwelling between the two cherubims so the garden and the house of the Lord are the place of God's presence it's where the word is represented where Christ is represented it's what the Holy Ghost was signifying that Christ would make a way for for us to be back into fellowship with God in his presence now I'd like for you to think of it this way that the house of the Lord the the garden and the life that exist in the beginning was not a labyrinth nor was the house of the Lord a labyrinth if we looked at the house of the Lord and though there was carnal ordinances and meats and drinks and diverse Washings and there's a lot of things that pertained to it in its structure just as the Garden of Eden was very ornate and there's a lot of beautiful complexities the house of the Lord the same way but yet it was very it's simply structured it was very straightforward and it was established to bring glory to God it was established uh to bring God's presence it was established to have the shakina glory amongst Israel now that's what the Temple of the house of the Lord should have been but in Matthew 21:13 and he said unto them it is written my house shall be called The House of Prayer but ye have made it a den of Thieves this is what the house of the Lord had become if you look at the temple in the days of Herod my what an incredible structure it had become as God had originally had Solomon build it in it simp licity of an outer court and inner court and the holy of holies now there is so much built around it and so much Commerce added to it in some ways when I was studying this and looking at it's was like it became a labyrinth with all sorts of rooms and courts and everything built up around it he say there's nothing wrong with those things but if you lose the meaning of the outer and the inner and you lose the presence of God in the most holy place what is all the other stuff for needlessly complex if all of it doesn't bring you into to his presence if all of it doesn't lift up the word if all of it doesn't bring you to Christ it's needlessly complex and this is exactly what Jesus is call out you have become this place which ought to have been the habitation of the shikina glory he says has become a den of Thieves Christ has been driven out of it the sh glory is no longer there I I am no longer welcome in my own house because through your own ideas you have made it a den of Thieves and what does he say about the thieves in John 10:10 the thief comes only to steal and to kill and to destroy they may have been there promising the worshipper away to access God they may have been there selling Wares to facilitate worship and to Plate their conscience and to satisfy God's requirements but they were truly there to steal to kill and destroy no matter how much Lip lip service they paid to the law no matter how much they said their doves were right no matter how much they claimed all the offerings were perfect they were not amen that's right and at the very least they were not simple they were not there in their liberality they were not there truly to to make sacrifice they were there to line their pockets they were there to kill to steal and to destroy and that's what Jesus said you've made the house of God a place that is needlessly complicated and you've done it to serve man and not me the very thing the prophet Samuel was raised up to correct Malachi 1: 7 and 8 he says ye offer polluted bread upon my altar this is what the Book of Malachi is concluding before Christ comes in the New Testament as you read it chronolog in the chronology of the Bible you offered polluted bread upon my Altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee so it says you've polluted me and they say how polluted bread in that you say the table of Lord is contemptible and if you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil he's not talking about blind people but remember offerings and sacrifices were to have a certain character a certain quality in other words the word said to do it this way and they're kind of compromising and you know someone goes to offer up you know a turtle D like why is this one wearing glasses right it's like oh it's fashion don't worry about it you know it's it doesn't really matter it's the inside that counts and so it was said well if you offer blind for sacrifice is not if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil words didn't God tell you to do it this way and now you're just skirting around and you're just saying it's become just ceremony it's become pretense it's all done just to give the show to say we've complied he's really calling this out he says offer it now under thy Governor woo that's was good go offer the very things you're trying to offer to God in the house of the Lord offer it to the governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person if you tried to offer the things you're trying to offer God to the most to the your r rulers and the natural people what would they think about it wa this is what you're giving me he says saith the Lord of hosts this is what the house of the Lord had become a den of Thieves blind sacrifices lame and sick and it was all evil it was not the way that the word of God had commanded it so he says in Matthew 23: 13 we've read from this very heavily recently but wo and you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites the Pharisee embodies the hypocrite Jesus Christ was calling out the hypocrite in his Parables and some of the things that we've been covering for ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in and other words the Kingdom of Heaven is real and they're not willing to enter in they're not willing to do it as God said to do it they're not willing to worship as God said to worship the house of the Lord is no longer functioning the way that God said it should be functioned and they are not willing to do it and that's bad in itself but then they wouldn't let anybody else do it so they contrived a lot of different ways to scare people away from the true word of God Luke 11:52 he says that this way woe unto you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered notice again as you can think back to some of the things we've been ministering on my people are destroyed from for lack of knowledge how that there was this uh um in The Parables of the Rich Young Ruler and The Parables of Lazarus a and Devas and these different things if you look back at those examples there was this disregard for the word of God and they took away the key of knowledge they didn't want to enter into the kingdom of God and if they couldn't enter in for whatever their reasons were they're going to try to keep you from entering in too and Jesus summarizes it this way or I want to use this scripture in summary Mark 7:13 making the word of God go back and read the prior verses to this making the word of God as he's walking through these scenarios where uh one ought to do this and one ought to do that and he says you've taken the word that God gave for a very specific purpose in the law and you've made the word of God of no effect it doesn't produce what it was designed to produce it doesn't accomplish what it was supposed to accomplish God said if this happened do this and it do it it would bring peace it' bring resolution it would take care of the matter but you through your Traditions have made the word of God ineffective which you have delivered in many such like things do ye it's all ceremony by your Traditions it's man-made you've taken the things of God and you've added to it you've taken away and and you've done things to where you've you've confused the truth I was fellowshiping with brother Jim Pinkston yesterday and he made a comment that uh uh I thought it interesting understand that he quoted some of the very scriptures I had in my notes I was like well I'm not necessarily taking this as a green light but he said that one way that one will keep from entering in won't enter in is they just leave it alone they won't get into it they won't preach it how do they keep you from entering They Don't Preach the word of God because they're not willing to enter in themselves so it all became ceremony became man-made now the gospel is meant and intended to bring us into relationship with Jesus Christ I'll say this if the message of the hour does not bring you into relationship with Christ that would be very problematic and if we somehow try to justify ourselves by saying oh but uh uh William brandom or oh but this guy or this guy or church or the people if it does not bring us into relationship with Jesus Christ there's a problem because the gospel which brother bradam I believe came in support of and restoring in defense of and was preaching the gospel is to bring us into relationship with God and is to bring us into his presence the house of the Lord was meant to be a place a sanctuary in those days that man could come and offer worship and sacrifices according to the word of God and in doing so though it wouldn't divorce him from sin it became a way that he could satisfy God's requirements and the worshipper could be purged of their incidental sins and those things of re to say I know that I've done what God required of me but it had completely been made into a dent of Thieves and the word which God had intended to keep the children of Israel was of no effect upon the people it was mere ceremony it's all outward brother Bram says in the dedication of building of the Lord he's talking about some of these uh diverse Washings and these different things in this he's talking specifically in the temple then hup would be thrown in with the Scarlet cedar wood and hup now we know that this is used also in The Exodus but now he's if I recall correctly as I was studying it it's uh he's using it in uh some sort of service in the temple hup is nothing but common weed meaning that the gospel must never be taught by Dr PhD it must be taught in humility in other words it shouldn't be your PhD that forms the basis for your qualifications for delivering it it's not your knowledge and your education the lawyers in those days says W and you lawyers the lawyers were the ones that studied the law they're the ones studying the word that God had given they're the ones that are dividing into minute articles and tithing on mint and Anis and cumin and leaving the weightier matters of the law behind there was things that they were getting into and digging into and it's not education it's not a doctorate it's not a PhD that qualifies you to preach the word and it's none of those things that would necessarily disqualify you as long as you do it in humility and in the gift of God and the service of God he says it must be taught in humility just as humble as the weed is before you the gospel is never to be made complicated to the people it's to be humble amen and Jesus is saying this is needlessly complex you've turned the house of the Lord into a den of Thieves should be a House of Prayer it should be straightforward though it though there's details and there's a lot to it and you rely upon teaching and instruction and you you rely upon the goodness of others man once our hearts become solid once economics took control the whole thing became let loose into nothing but a a a money-making program and scheme to keep things going and to promote their own agendas and their own legacies it was not for the purpose of God's will being done and Paul says I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ just as it had been defiled to the woman he's now saying it's we I don't want you to be defiled and Christ is making this same observations about the Jews in his day you have defiled the house of the Lord Brother bam says in God's power to transform in the same pattern he deceived Eve he also has deceived the church which is there Eve was a type of the church notice what it did through the wandering for knowledge she slips across the line between right and wrong by listening to Satan's perversion or deformity of the original word of God how is it that Satan is successful by explaining away the value of the word of God he he he tries to deform it and pervert the original word of God for his Advantage because he has something to gain he's a businessman that has something to gain so in the same pattern that the the woman was deceived Satan is working in the church to cause her to wonder in this Labyrinth of knowledge trying to find Christ trying to find good trying to find life trying to please the Lord trying to satisfy themselves whatever it might be but it's perversion it's deformity it's defilement of the original word exactly as it was found in the days of Christ now to make this connection among the garden the house of the Lord and the bride at the end time I'm using the temptation of the woman the Temptation Of Christ and how that Paul says as the serpent beguiled Eve and that the bride in the end time will be Tried by the word the word should be Tried by the word not denominational interpretation but the word the word's going to be presented to her and the word isn't necessarily going to be like well this is God's honest truth do you believe it but you're going to be presented with the word and say yeah but or yeah and or are you sure that this is honest there's a way that it's to be presented to cause the doubt amen Matthew 4: 3-7 let us read this this will form a very critical uh basis for the remainder of our time this morning and when the tempter same one that tempted the woman he comes to Christ came to him and said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread and he Christ answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God the Bible says that he was hungry he had need of bread he had power to turn stones to bread but Satan presents this offer if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread now it's not an outlandish proposition if he was to do it he would be proving to the devil that he was a Believer he'd be proving to the devil that he was who he said he was and as the Bible said that the Rocks would cry out and there was there there was this belief in that uh as Christ even s said the Rocks would cow there's this belief that God could cause things to speak or things to utter forth and creation could praise uh for God to turn a stone into bread this this wouldn't be some magician's trick or it wouldn't be unfathomable so it says it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he's taking in this moment of tempt ation he's being asked to do something that perhaps he had not thought of or anticipated himself to say well I'm hungry why don't I just uh make myself some bread but he In This Moment he says well you know what's the most important thing besides that is the word of God and and that that's where he's going to stand now in the as it's told in Matthew chapter 4 Luke chapter 4 is a little bit different order and so you try to figure out which one was lying to you but in Matthew chapter 4 it says it this in verse 5 then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and Seth him on the Pinnacle of the temple now he has brought him to the Pinnacle of the temple he's right there on the grounds of the house of the Lord some surmise that the Pinnacle of the temple would have been the highest part A and where they had the steepest drop but nonetheless this would have been I would argue somewhat visible a a and maybe H uh you know this isn't he's not doing this in hiding necessarily he takes him to the Pinnacle of the temple and he says unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he's kind of learned something hasn't he he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against a stone God hath said that this would not you will not be harmed you will not be endangered you will not be your foot would not be dashed that the angels will look out after you they'll be your protection so he takes him to this high place and says if you are the Son of God cast yourself down because God said this is what he would do for the Messiah this is what he would do for you if you're a Son of God so cast yourself down and he answers in a very striking way Jesus said to him it is written again the devil used it is written right so Jesus says it is written again that thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God you'll find where brother B us says and God don't clown for anybody he says he doesn't have to answer anything that Satan asks that's why sometimes the question is you know D question and you say who's asking who wants to know right because I don't have to answer the devil's questions amen even though we do have the answer now notice what the devil does in this next phase he chose the Pinnacle of the house of the Lord to do what to cause Jesus I hope you can really focus it now to cause Jesus in his own words to tempt God how is it he tempts God Satan has said it in his proposition the Bible says that he wouldn't let your foot be dashed against a stone that the Angels God would allow the angels to intervene to stop this from happening so because God said this would happen for you he tries to make Jesus the instigator of the Fulfillment of that prophecy he tries to make Jesus the initiator of God fulfilling his word so he's made Jesus now of his own will or own violation in this challenge if thou be the Son of God go said that you would do this and this would follow you or this would happen so you go ahead and do it and Jesus says do you realize what you're doing you're wanting me to say well God you said and then to tempt him to fulfill his word in Mark chapter 16: 17 and 18 if we want to make this a practical for us Jesus said and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and they and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so how is it that we could tempt God in the same way it is written that these signs shall follow them that believe so we could tempt God by pushing the signs trying to force his hand and speaking in tongu trying to force his hand in healing trying to say well this is what you said and this is what's going to happen and we tempt God now this may seem seem to be a challenge in terms of getting our heads around this but it's amazing how sometimes people are very quick to say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall cast out devils in my name they shall speak with tongues and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and they force it as a mandate that you must produce or you're not a Believer and for some reason I think their Bibles skipped a lot of verse 18 CU they don't pass out snakes right and they don't drink poison right to tempt God then again there's those that do to do exactly that because they've made the word of God no effect to their Traditions the mandating the laying on of hands the mandating of healing the mandating to where it becomes manmade proposition I hope you're really listening to this it's in the word of God it's the children's bread it's in the Covenant it's God's promise he said he would fulfill it faith is what activates it as soon as man tries to get in and make a program out of it it's not what it you is meant to be in question and answers part four brother Brandon basically says he I'm around snake handlers what about it dear prophet of God he refers to Mark 16:18 part of L hands on the sick he says I'm around snake handlers what about it yeah we can preach this in North Carolina he said well that's a good question if you're around snake handlers and they say Mark 16 what are they going to be saying these signs shall follow them that believe they shall uh cast out devils in my name and speak with new tongues and take up serpents and drink deadly things and lay hands on the sick he said they're probably going to quote Mark 16 certainly I believe that the Bible means just what it says it means just what it says so you would be a fool to deny this as the signs that follow them that believe but notice that Satan made the offer that this sign shall follow the Messiah you follow me is it is this a difficult proposition is this an immodest proposal think about what I'm asking you today to consider according to the word of God he says I believe if we we try to tempt the Lord into something we're in for it but I don't think that God means for you to bring me a bottle of arsenic to see if I could drink it and prove to you that I have faith more no more than I believe it would be right for you to bring me a snake and let me pick it up and show you I have faith that I can overcome its poison I don't believe that that's so you know there's a certain mechanics of forcing it in other words it'd say like I'll prove you I'm a Believer you go find somebody sick and bring them in here you bring somebody in lame kicking and dragging leave me alone right and I'm going to prove to you that's not the spirit of the Gospel he says I don't believe that so I don't believe that it was that if I was in the water he says I do believe Now Catch the thought to this I do believe if I was in the water water baptizing people doing the work of the Lord or out in the jungle and a snake bit me I'd walk right on in the name of Jes name of the Lord notice how it seems to be in the course of the regular commission that we have not made it part of our commission to lay hands on the sick to take up deadly serpents to drink poison to speak in tongues we have not made that part of the commission but as I go into all the world and preach the gospel if the gospel brings forth the sick lay hands on them if in preaching the gospel you're they try to poison you you will be made H W ho if you're preaching the gospel and snakes try to bite you don't worry about if you're preaching the gospel you'll be speaking a new language preach the gospel let Christ have the prance and let the word do the rest knowing that he promised to do the rest I hope you can catch how he's answering this in 1964 in the year in which he was a prophet I believe that that's what it meant he says what you do with that dear person ever who you are remember this watch what the Bible did about it we could draw from that lesson of Paul no more than I believe if you say Glory Glory Glory I mean what's he talking about I believe you try to say Glory Glory Glory don't tempt God to speak in tongues just let the spirit speak through you now I don't believe in tempting God or pushing anything we wait upon the spirit it does it so what was the devil trying to do well the Bible said these signs shall follow the Messiah and prove it do it and Jesus Jesus didn't get into tizzy just as the woman was tempted oh my goodness and and and she allows herself to be drawn into air and adultery Christ in that moment showed us how to overcome not by power not by saying can we go back to the first question I think the bread will be enough right he said no it is also written bringing it back to the word and the word only Amen in other words you are preserving the reality in the sacredness of the word that says these signs shall follow them that believe you believe it so much to be the word of God you would not pervert it you would not want to defile it you would not want to impersonate it God who wrote it and made the promise has got to be the one to do [Music] it and it would be tempting God in that moment where he says wait a minute I'm not he doesn't say well that's not true and we need to be careful the Bible says to do this well that's not true speaking in tongues as of the devil laying hands on the sick is I'm the devil no you would but we have to recognize it's truth but how would we pervert it and make it of the devil when we tempt God and try to do it I hope that's abundantly clear Satan if you can look at it from this vantage point they're out there in the wilderness turn these stones into bread he says it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God oh okay so you're a believer you believe the word you're going to do what the word says okay the word says that if you cast yourself down angels will bear thee up because he won't let the messiah's foot even be dashed by a stone so give me do it you you you believe the word and he says yeah I do I'm not going to deny it I'm not say well that's not true he says it is written that thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God he brings them up to the Pinnacle of the Temple this elevated platform in this stage to bring them up before an audience and he tries to make this Vindication a public show at the house of the Lord just think about that a little bit the or orchestrating for this to be Christ The Pinnacle of the temple a busy place trying to to force it for him to be the Messiah they knew that the Messiah would suddenly come to his Temple this would be the moment this would be the time scriptures would just start coming to pass immediately but Jesus knew better than to tempt the Lord thy God the house of Lord was ordered a certain way and please remain with me I know that we've probably been around an hour but please remain very very close to me the house of the Lord was ordered in a certain way as we've said before on purpose that God in having the outer court and even when that final tent was erected to create the outer Court the presence of God came down in the in the most holy place and God Vindicated this Arrangement this structure God was very deliberate in establishing the temple with this order I found this drawing to be uh pretty detailed and uh actually I there's a lot a lot of detail to it but I don't necessarily want you to get caught up in the detail but in looking at this this arrangement of Sol 's Temple I want you I wanted just to represent it visually that you have here here's the outer Court you have the Altar and you have the the the Laver and then you have the uh the porch into what they say is the temple then the Oracle but this is the outer Court outer Court inner Court holy of holies you got that as you look at it in the outer court now think of this in the outer Court there would be natural light you have the ab Brazen labor the Brazen altar there in the outer Court it would be under the conditions of Night and Day the cycle of the night and the the evening and the morning some days it could be sunny some days it could be cloudy it's all dependent upon the atmospheres and and the Earth but then as you go out of the outer Court into the temple as it says here or the holy place there in the Holy place you have the candlesticks the seven golden candlesticks the lampstand which you could see that would represent Church ages in there a man had to light the candle it was man-made light there was sh that was baked there was the altar of incense there was another altar there in the Holy place but in the holiest place once you got in behind the veil there God was the light it was a supernatural light there was the ark of the testimony there were the cherums there was the place that God said he would dwell and brother bandam in the sermon hidden life with Christ says you know remember some of these themes in Hidden life he says through the Lutheran Age come forth the just shall live by faith the outer Court this is where we're going to get into the LA in the the I think I have the quotation here this is where you're going to see this Labyrinth the house of God was not a labyrinth it was straightforward God made this arrangement for a reason the outer Court along with the methodists came the sanctification age they call the second definite work of Grace which come in that age and there's the altar age and then the last day is the restoration of the Holy Spirit the hidden life now I don't necessarily want you to get so caught up on whether or not we could bring these distinct distinctions in each age but brother just using this as as a type this Evolution says and in the last days the restoration of the Holy Spirit the hidden life and I'm sure right there's where the trouble ISS are you following this now outer Court inner Court Most Holy Place outer Court Temple Oracle however you want to do it this three-fold division of the house of the Lord that there was an outer court and there were certain things done there certain people allowed there then you narrowed it down then you narrowed it down and these things were all signifying Jesus Christ think of all these things we tried to uh uh introduce into our thought process today he said not where the trouble lays I want you to see it right here's where the trouble lays with the church today can't deviate between the Altar and the holiest of holies now I would say the language is interesting because to deviate is to wander away from to deviate we say oh they deviated off course it's it's maybe to get off course to get off the path so in the way that he's saying it they can't deviate between the Altar and the host of holies the way that it strikes me I'll leave it to the Lord to maybe strike you they're not able to distinguish between the the the the outer Court The Altar and the holies of holies that there when they that the deviation certainly it's a deviation but they're deviating by remaining at this altar of incense they're deviating by remaining at a Brazen altar they're deviating in these other ages and these other ways in not following the way into the present pres they can't distinguish they can't deviate between the Altar and the Hol of holies now if you could say this if I could say this you can't in the way just one maybe one other way to look at this he says you can't wander away from the holy of holies you can't deviate away from the holy of holies back to the altar right that that this is where the problem lays either they don't know how to get in there or they're wandering away from it the problem lays between the Altar and the Shak of Glory the problem lays between the Altar and the presence of Christ the holy of holies he says in there is where the place where the church ought to be in there and there's too many of them still on the outside out there instead of being in here you catch how he's laid this out you're to go all the way into Christ and there's this Meandering and this maze that when you go this you got to back up and do this and do this you got to back up and do this he says you can't deviate I'm not I know I'm bringing two different interpretations of how he say you can't deviate meaning you got to go in or they can't distinguish they can't go in either way it stands for this proposition the problem laid between the Altar and getting into Christ the house of the Lord had become a labyrinth it had become the Labyrinth a massive confusion a maze they're offering evil sacrifices blind and lame and sick sacrifices bread that had been defiled merchants and money changers and all sorts of people in there making sure that here we can we take Bitcoin we do Square you can do this just tap your phone we do Apple pay everybody was in there trying to facilitate religion facilitate ceremony facilitate the plating of one's conscience and it was a sign it was symbolic of what Christianity would become later on where it's all s it's all ceremony it's either too formal or it's just it's completely let loose of the word of God someone could say turn over the money tables kick out the money tables every man ought to Worship in the way that he wants to Jesus saiding they must Worship in spirit and in truth there was a way that God intended this even though you might look like you're doing it you've all become whitewashed tombs the of the the hyp hypocrisy of the Pharisee a mass of confusion had become in the days of Christ what was the trouble then and even now he cannot distinguish between the inner Court The Altar and holy of holies the altar where the where gifts were brought the altar where things were offered the altar where there was this continual worship this altar there whether you want to talk about the Brazen labor or the Brazen altar in the outer court or here is brother BR calls this altar in this inner court with in these Church ages representing these golden candlesticks and these lampstands they're all there but what were they there signifying what were they there as a figure of Christ that when he was to come man was to enter into the most holy place so Satan has devised a scheme to try to get us to live in the inner Court the altars and the gifts were intended by God to bring us into his presence not replace it whether it be the altar at which you would give your heart to God or you would pray whether it be the the the healing and the gifts and the manifestation of his Spirit to profit all it was given to bring us deeper into relationship with Christ to bring us into a greater confidence in his word to bring us into his presence not replace it Paul says in Galatians 1: 16 and 7 I Marvel that you were so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ one that would trouble you cause inward commotion to to take away one's calmness of mind to cause those Scruples to be questioned to cause doubting it means to render anxious or distress to perplex the Mind through doubt Paul is saying man you're being removed from the gospel that I have called you to and out of the grace of Christ the Simplicity of Christ into another gospel which there's not another gospel into another Jesus there's not really another Jesus but these trouble you they take away your peace they make you anxious and perplex your mind by perverting the gospel of Christ by defiling the gospel of Christ the trouble is in The Labyrinth I'm using this phrase because I believe brother Brandon pointed to it in the church age book I believe that it's a phrase that could help us just to summarize very quickly in our minds what Christianity has become and what some try to make the message into a man-made structure that as soon as man gets a hold of it becomes confusing misleading and deceiving brother Bram and drawing from comenius in chapter 7 of the church AG book it says in Divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God I think it behooves us as I believe I talked one time about anecdotal faith and and and and how that we have to be very careful and even our test ifying to where there's a way in which man could be trying to testify of the goodness of God to where the goodness of God never anchors in faith in God or his word it's just look what God did look what God did and it's the words of men are heard more than the word of God and and other but instead it's God did this for me God this this for me and and not saying upon what basis can I believe the word of God each one chap PS as he pleases or kills Time by learn disquisitions and disproving the views of others that a Shame of the new birth and how a man must be changed in the likeness of Christ become partaker of the divine nature scarcely anything is said this is how you can be moved from a gospel this is how you can allow your minds to be defiled is by listening to chatter people who kill time by learn disquisitions and disproving the views of others but the new birth and how a man must be in the change to the likeness of Christ how he could be a partaker of the divine nature this is not just one little phrase this is weighty this is Hefty this is the New Covenant scarcely anything is said in Jude 19 or Jude he talks about how there's certain men who've crept un unawares amongst you and they're defiling the grace of God they're giving themselves over to lasciviousness he says these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit they disjoin they they part they separate making divisions and separations what has come from another gospel another Jesus another Spirit what has come from the warning in Galatians the warning in Corinthians what has come out of these separations and these men that are sensual self-promotion of a greater sanctity self-promotion of Greater Works self-promotion of unique doctrines that distinguish themselves from everybody else and what does the gospel become confusion in the sermon hear ye himym are we about our father's business of the Holy Spirit getting every soul saved we can just on the word or are we arrogant and dilatory in arguing our little religious differences and splitting hairs such nonsense no wonder faith is gone splitting hairs the Labyrinth the thousand of minute articles the thousand matters of conscience through arrogance through failure dilator failure to do your duty arguing about little religious differences and splitting hairs he says that's why faith is gone we got to understand and know what builds Faith 1 Corinthians chapter 3: 1-4 and Brethren could not speak I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ I fed you with milk and not with meat for hither to you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able for you are yet carnal for as there is among you envy and in strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men where there's splitting hairs where there's divisions where there's envy and jealousy and strife and party makak and politicking where there's a lack of Simplicity where there's a lack of Liberty and remember some of those that promised the greatest Liberty are the ones that parot the Bible as much as they possibly can and Paul says then promising Liberty actually bring you into greater bondage for while one saith I am a Paul and another I am of apollis are ye not carnal when you've separated yourself into these factions and these divisions you're carnal in the sermon of the Hidden life brother the B says the next court was a lampstand with a Justified stand and it was lit by human hands there's where we argue our denominations where we argue our differences split hairs this is where it happens sensual given to the flesh uh uh emotional things that are that are in that Spirit realm he's saying they can't deviate between the Altar and the holiest of holies they can't deviate from the man-made light the man-made worship the man-made uh uh offerings the man-made things the things of the flesh they can't deviate he says and that's where we split hairs that's where we argue that's where we differ that's where we have our differences but in Christ these distinctions are removed not that it would abolish particularities of confession not that it would abolish particularities of interpretations or or ways of viewing things but if we never get to Christ we have no common ground but to yield to commands interpretation of what the word says envy and strife and divisions that's what's there in this court around this altar lit by human hands that's where we argue our denominations that where where we argue our difference in split hairs oh I don't believe in Divine Healing I don't believe the Visions come from God I don't believe this I don't believe that you're arguing because you're living in the in her Court you're living in the altar you're living in the Holy place you're living in the temple he says yet you're eating Mana but you're living under artificial light sometimes the light goes out sometime your lamp gets smoked up camp meeting cramps convention to Convention Revival to Revival evangelist to evangelist but to who he who desires to hide away amen walk into the next place there's no artificial light anywhere but down between the Ark of the wings of these cheram was a supernatural light hanging in there which was a Halo of God that Lit the whole room it's only when we have deviated away from the most holy place that we split hairs that we argue we try to answer the devil but oh that I can live in the shakina glory the place where there is no artificial light it's the way out of the labyrinth that the Christianity's become in Luke 4 verse4 the orders a little bit differently but it says this when he was tempted to turn stones to bread in the first Temptation the next I believe he's uh brought to see all the kingdoms and the third is to the Pinnacle of the temple and Jesus answering said it is written this is this emphasis in the sermon of the Harvest time it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God in the face of the word being quoted to Jesus he never denied the word he didn't try to tear it down he didn't try to Sol it he didn't try to question it he just stuck with the word that also said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God do you believe that we're living in the end time yes amen do we believe that the powers of Satan are 10 times harder than they've been in any age is this the most treacherous age the most deceitful age is it dark is it confusing absolutely and what is it he's trying to confuse us on politics no now just be at the risk of causing an uproar a Holy Spirit-filled believer can vote for a libertarian okay and a Democrat could they vote for Trump okay everybody's just like nope we're not saying nothing not going to do it where are we tempted away from Christ into the Labyrinth the smokiness the cloudiness the arguing the fighting the crowds of people in the in these other Chambers and Christ says I have forever consecrated a way not for a church but for the individual to enter into the most holy place and abide with me there the sanctuary restored man back as it were between the cherubims in fellowship with Christ and so when Jesus says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God Satan tempts us then on every word of God if you won't disagree with the word of God he'll try to misinterpret the word to you as he did the woman and the Harvest time hopefully this will be able to maybe move on to some other themes and some of our future Services still in the house of the Lord I hope you can see how a lot of this is connecting together in the Harvest Time notice if Satan fails there where turn the stones to bread then he'll try his second scheme on you and get you to disbelieve the word how and go to the Seminary he'll try the next a scheme now here is where you want to be real careful and just sit for another five minutes on this part if you will then he makes you a supernatural offer so come back to all this just before closing so if you're listening to the Harvest time you could track this much better than I can convey it now when Jesus said I live by every word of God then what he wanted to do is say it is written and use it to make him a supernatural offer this is all connecting together now everything we tried to express to you the house of the Lord and its defilement and the hidden life and these different things and and and how we came to the part of him tempting Jesus in Matthew 4 this is where Jesus has drawing this from and how he's trying to tempt what did he say to him if thou be the Son of God cast yourself off the temple and the word of God says this is what will happen this is where you want to be careful then he makes you a supernatural offer I'm going to come back to all this just before closing listen if he can't tempt you away from the word now I'm going to stay with the word then then he'll give you a supernatural offer if you're going to Proclaim your faith in the word if you're going to say you can't shake me from it the word my faith is in the word man shall live by the word only he'll say okay then I'm going to test you and tempt you with the word to get you away from the word only no I'm going to stay with the word then he'll give you a supernatural offer he said I tell you what you get up there and dive off the temple and bring back up see how the see show the people that you can do something Supernatural boy he got them there now watch this this is it watch when you get to the end where this temptation come we're in the end why where's this temptation at maybe he might let some of you speak in tongues think you got it or he might even let you prophesy though it not be with the word think of where the Temptation has come at the end with false prophecies false tongues false discernment I've seen people stand up and prophesy was contrary to the word as it to the word is the east from the West it's the word that you live by them Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand them out by the handfuls that don't mean one thing amen the Temptation at the end is a supernatural offer to get you to tempt God and to draw you away for the Simplicity of Christ does that mean we deny healing do we deny tongues do we deny deny Supernatural gifts no that's right but we don't make it complicated we don't make it confusing we don't make it amaz where there's this Meandering and we're following in this Meandering Pathway to try to find something secret place where we can get our our sins forgiven and we can be healed but Christ is the one thing needful if I could say this hope hopefully building a block to continue for the a future as we go forward the house of the Lord Brothers if you could come to your instruments the house of the Lord was not a labyrinth but it represented even in its divisions and its worship it represented a way back into God's presence therefore Our lives our homes our churches as we're looking at the house of the Lord as it's represented in us should have the same purpose we should be experiencing the same effect and what Satan is going to try to do in the end times is to tempt us away from the word of God to tempt us away from our faith in God by getting us to question and to doubt to get our Scruples up and to present to us us a case whether it be as he did to the woman to question God's honesty or as he did to Christ to tempt him to clown for the devil to tempt him into manmade Works signs manifestations to prove that he was a Son of God and brother Bram says oh boy he got them there a supernatural offer I know it seems very very strange to say a super Supernatural offer could be these signs shall follow them that believe brother bam said it's tempting God if he says Don't Tempt God to speak in tongues just let the spirit speak through you let's not tempt God in laying on of hands let's not tempt God in handling snakes let's not tempt God in trying to cast out devils in his name preach the gospel that's the Great Commission preach the gospel and Christ will do the rest he will deliver he will heal he will protect you in Luke 4:1 13 I wanted to close on this it's kind of sobering in Matthew it says then the devil departed and the angels came and ministered to him and it says and when the devil had ended all the Temptation he departed from him for a season he's back he's back didn't take them long even the scripture I'm not implying he was gone for a couple thousand years but he tempts again and what does he tempt away from your absolute steadfast confidence in the Simplicity that is in Christ in the Simplicity of God that he loves you he made a promise to you I will concede this world is a mess it's a labyrinth I I can't defend this world it's politics it's economics people trying to figure things out in presidential elections and whether not this President is good for this and this President is good for that listen we've got better analytics now and there's things that we have thought held true for years and oh we always thought it was this way and now that they can look at things in a deeper way and look at the metrics they're finding well this doesn't always hold true and the the stock market and and inflation and employment rates and all s there there's more data and information that's coming to bear on certain things to where they're realizing stuff that they never realized before and it's not just simply well what you how are you going to vote this year and it's going to be this way it's going to be that way it's all a mess it's a mess out there yes and what ought to have been a sanctuary from the world is Christ but then he's been chopped up and divided up into a million different pieces and just in the same likeness and the same figure as Christ came in his day at the darkest of hour to fulfill his promise and to bring about Redemption I believe that a prophet came on the scene in this hour in a similar time of confusion in the midst of a labyrinth and he didn't make another Labyrinth and man I I wish to God that it could have just been very very simple and so uh when I say simple just just one sermon so Vindicated so pronounced so vivid so real Earth shattering groundbreaking that it could have just settled everything and everyone is now existing in this Utopia a little Bethlehem a New Jerusalem right here on Earth believing in Jesus Christ honoring his word but there be some that still pervert the god gospel of Christ and will even use the message even use the message to try to lead you away from Christ but they don't do it honestly let us not be deceived church God is real God is Not mocked let us not tempt God but let us trust him trust him absolutely I pray I you I pray I'll pray this in a moment when we have you stand I pray that my burden is not question today I pray that in the the the the weight and the uh breadth of what I've expressed cuz it's a lot that there just be just a theme in your heart that anchors down that I can trust Jesus that Christ this word of God is true the word of God is real he's mindful of me and that there's this enemy that's trying to intervene and attack and trying to get us to drag us out deviate away from the holy hly drag us back to the altar drag us back to the lampstands right enti drag us back to the cloudiness and the the the crowds and I want to get into I want I want to get back into Christ I want to stand in there and commune with him between the cherubims as the devil departed Christ for a season I believe the devil is RA on a rampage trying harder than ever to just to tangle us up and mix us up let us not be confused Saints God is real this word is true follow him with everything that's in your heart stand together today
