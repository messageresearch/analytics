[0:00] such exciting scriptures to
[0:02] read uh so much depth and richness in
[0:05] these things I want to hope hopefully by
[0:07] God's grace
[0:08] today just uh maybe not even scratch the
[0:11] surface but at least point to it and
[0:13] look at some of the things that are
[0:15] contained here just so beautiful my
[0:17] title today is knowledge is power and I
[0:20] know that might sound like a little bit
[0:22] of clickbait and maybe in some ways it
[0:24] is because that might seem to be a
[0:25] little bit of a controversial statement
[0:27] uh before you judge it uh just hold
[0:29] tight get to a place in the scripture I
[0:31] think it'll become clear what we mean by
[0:32] this I thought about calling it
[0:34] knowledge is empowering that might help
[0:36] some be able to swallow it but I just uh
[0:38] felt settled on this title yesterday
[0:40] knowledge is power and this power that
[0:43] we're talking about may not be the power
[0:45] that we think about in terms of physical
[0:47] strength the knowledge that we're
[0:48] talking about may not be the knowledge
[0:50] we're talking about in terms of mental
[0:51] prowess but we're talking about
[0:53] manifesting Heaven's mystery here on
[0:56] Earth right now today as Believers uh
[0:59] manifesting the kingdom of God in our
[1:01] lives and having a Kingdom Life seeing
[1:03] Kingdom order established in our
[1:05] relationships and we're just uh uh hope
[1:09] that this uh particular subject matter
[1:10] will be a blessing to you Isaiah 11:9 I
[1:14] want to start here because we were at
[1:15] this juncture on Wednesday says they
[1:18] shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
[1:21] Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be
[1:23] full of the knowledge of the Lord as the
[1:26] waters cover the sea Wednesday we looked
[1:29] at how what that meant to say the waters
[1:31] cover the sea and as the waters in the
[1:33] oceans extend down to all the depths and
[1:35] fill up all the trenches and caverns and
[1:37] caves uh in the Seas so shall the
[1:40] knowledge of the Lord be it's just going
[1:41] to find its way into every crevice and
[1:44] uh anywhere that there's space anywhere
[1:46] that it can fill up it's going to do so
[1:48] and that's the kind of the idea behind
[1:50] the um this knowledge of the Lord shall
[1:55] fill the Earth as the waters cover the
[1:57] sea and if I could just back up a little
[2:00] bit we when we ministered on no more
[2:02] shadows and I believe manifesting your
[2:04] measure of Glory we touched a lot on
[2:05] this but our future home will have no
[2:07] death no sorrow I maybe it doesn't
[2:10] excite you that there'll be no death
[2:12] there I think after all those prayer
[2:13] requests that might have there might
[2:15] have been at least an extinctive thank
[2:18] goodness but there will be no disease
[2:20] there'll be no sin there'll be no
[2:21] shadows and as it says here they shall
[2:24] not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy
[2:26] Mountain I want to say this at the
[2:27] outset just to get this kind of in your
[2:29] mind a little bit says they shall not
[2:31] hurt I know that they there may seem a
[2:33] little bit ambiguous and it's kind of
[2:35] alluding uh to some things it says they
[2:38] shall not hurt it means to be bad to be
[2:40] evil or displeasing uh to hurt it's to
[2:43] be uh sad or ous and it means to do an
[2:47] injury or to do evil comes from the the
[2:49] root in the Hebrew there's to break or
[2:51] to shatter says that they shall not hurt
[2:54] they will not do evil they will not do
[2:56] injury there will be nothing displeasing
[2:58] that's quite a statement there will be
[2:59] nothing nothing no injury no Hurt No
[3:01] Evil in my Holy Mountain it says and
[3:03] they shall not destroy that means to
[3:06] corrupt or to ruin something kind of
[3:08] being decayed and something be be
[3:09] changed uh in the Hebrews to Mar or to
[3:12] spoil in other words it's to pervert
[3:14] something something in its Purity when
[3:16] it's perverted it's destroyed it's no
[3:18] longer what it was it's no longer in the
[3:20] condition that God originally intended
[3:22] it to be so it's quite a statement to
[3:23] say they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[3:26] all my Holy Mountain and then it says
[3:28] for the Earth shall be full of the
[3:30] knowledge of the Lord and in the sermon
[3:33] the future home of the Heavenly
[3:34] bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother
[3:37] Bram says now have you got have you got
[3:40] the city see it's a Holy Mountain it's
[3:42] in that place where he's describing it's
[3:44] not a cube it's a pyramid it's a
[3:46] mountain and he says nothing shall hurt
[3:48] or destroy in all my Holy Mountain saith
[3:51] the Lord and if you've been looking at
[3:54] this sermon uh future home and been
[3:56] studying it a little bit you'll find
[3:57] that this use of this scripture here in
[3:59] isaah is 11 is quite striking because
[4:02] what he has done is he's carried this
[4:03] description here in Isaiah 11 into the
[4:06] New Jerusalem into the eighth day as
[4:08] he's calling it The Holy Mountain and
[4:10] he's wanting us to see this picture that
[4:11] God has in his mind and he uses this
[4:13] imagery of a mountain not a cube uh
[4:16] maybe not uh uh what people might think
[4:18] of Mount Zion there in Jerusalem or near
[4:21] Jerusalem but that Mount Zion stood for
[4:22] the bride that Mount Zion stood for
[4:25] something spiritual that Mount Zion is
[4:26] that New Jerusalem the city of God
[4:28] coming out of heaven of God coming down
[4:31] to the Earth and so brother Bram it's
[4:33] picking up on this imagery of Isaiah
[4:35] 11:9 when he says they shall nothing
[4:37] shall hurt or destroy in all my Holy
[4:39] Mountain and in Revelations 21:4 we read
[4:43] where it says and God shall wipe all
[4:44] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[4:47] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[4:49] neither shall there be any more pain for
[4:52] the former things are ped away this is
[4:55] in that in that Eighth Day in
[4:57] Revelations 21 in this city God's wiping
[5:00] all tears away tears will have no more
[5:02] purpose pain will have no more purpose
[5:04] sorrow will have no more purpose death
[5:06] will have no more purpose it's actually
[5:08] going to be cast in Lake of Fire itself
[5:09] and completely destroyed and so there's
[5:11] none of those things there anymore then
[5:14] in verse 27 it says and there shall in
[5:16] no wise enter into it anything that
[5:20] defileth this is into that City into
[5:22] this place neither whatsoever worketh
[5:24] Abomination or maketh a lie but they
[5:27] which are written in the Lamb's Book of
[5:29] Life
[5:30] this is our future home this is us being
[5:33] able to read uh in in in these words
[5:36] here in this description and even the
[5:38] symbolic desri descriptions contained
[5:40] around here that this is the the world
[5:42] in its final condition this is the world
[5:45] in its the final outcome of this
[5:47] Redemptive process and brother Bram
[5:49] describes it this way in future home so
[5:51] it's just a great Mountain like the
[5:53] pyramid and the city is on the mountain
[5:56] Glory there you are there is the par
[5:59] Paradise of God the light of the world
[6:02] that perfect Kingdom that's the
[6:04] Perfection of perfection of perfection
[6:06] that perfect Kingdom not the seventh day
[6:09] the Eternal one not the Millennium the
[6:12] new Earth and that's he's wanting to
[6:14] shift perspective there a little bit so
[6:16] you're not looking at these things
[6:18] necessarily Millennium because seems
[6:19] like a lot of things might fit but he's
[6:21] saying these things in Revelations 21
[6:23] this future home it's not the Millennium
[6:25] but it's the new Earth in that Eighth
[6:27] Day the paradise of God
[6:30] and how is it that we've arrived to this
[6:32] condition this paradise of God the light
[6:35] of the world the perfect Kingdom this
[6:37] city on this mountain as brother br's
[6:39] describing it Revelations 21 Revelations
[6:41] uh uh uh as it's described brother BR
[6:44] and the future home describing it how
[6:45] did it get there through that plan and
[6:47] process of redemption we've been using
[6:49] this very carefully over the last few
[6:51] Services it's uh this process of
[6:53] redemption has created this perfect
[6:56] Kingdom and what's kind of been uh um
[6:59] the theme over the last few Services is
[7:01] even though this Plan of Redemption is
[7:03] in three stages we shouldn't just look
[7:05] at our lives as being well I'm Justified
[7:08] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[7:09] and kind of like that's it you're on a
[7:11] shelf let's go get the next one and get
[7:13] them to the Stations of the message and
[7:15] they can they can do the do all the
[7:17] check the boxes of the new birth it's
[7:19] there's it may be a three-stage process
[7:22] but it opens up so much
[7:24] more it it it that's if I could say it
[7:26] this way that's the beginning because
[7:28] that's the new birth
[7:30] something's just been born Uh Uh
[7:32] something's begun and so it's not when
[7:34] we think of three stages of redemption
[7:36] and we might think oh we've got these
[7:38] three classes we have these three stages
[7:39] while there's so much more to it and
[7:41] that even pertains to the Earth yes
[7:45] brother Bram says in the future home God
[7:47] has tabernacled in Man by redeeming him
[7:49] by these three processes so we know it's
[7:51] a three- States process he says now God
[7:53] is going to redeem the earth and the
[7:55] Tabernacle in the Earth with the
[7:57] subjects of the earth which he brought
[7:58] forth from from the earth and he's
[8:00] saying has God redeemed you through a
[8:02] three-part process that's how he redeems
[8:04] the Earth and I'm wanting you to
[8:05] recognize there's more to the Earth's
[8:07] Redemption and if we could see that
[8:09] connection that parallel well what God
[8:11] does to me he does to the Earth and we
[8:13] begin to see what he does to the Earth
[8:14] and if I could take scripture for you to
[8:15] see what is included in that process of
[8:18] redemption then it'll open up our eyes
[8:20] to see what's included in our process of
[8:22] redemption and all the benefits of
[8:25] redemption if the new birth places you
[8:27] in the body of Christ and makes
[8:28] available you all the promises of God
[8:31] then with yes the baptism of the Holy
[8:32] Ghost seals your Eternal Destiny but now
[8:34] I want to walk and enjoy all the
[8:37] benefits that are available to me as a
[8:39] born- again believer as we read recently
[8:41] I think in thirst that that there's so
[8:43] much privilege there's so much the skies
[8:45] are full of so much genuine that we can
[8:47] be partaking in so there they shall not
[8:51] hurt nor destroy and all my Holy
[8:53] Mountain for the Earth think of that
[8:54] phrase for the Earth shall be full of
[8:57] the knowledge of the Lord and as as we
[8:59] looked at the knowledge of the Lord on
[9:00] Wednesday night it doesn't mean to have
[9:03] knowledge of God and to have your mind
[9:06] just full of God to where every thought
[9:08] is God God God God God God God and
[9:09] everything is God God God God God God
[9:11] that's not what it thinks to what it
[9:12] means to say that you're full of the
[9:14] knowledge of the Lord but it means God's
[9:16] knowledge his judgment his opinion his
[9:20] discernment it speaks of the perception
[9:21] of God so that really your eyes see as
[9:24] God sees your mind processes things as
[9:26] God processes things so the Earth shall
[9:29] be full of the correct understanding of
[9:31] things somehow some way the correct
[9:34] understanding of things is going to uh
[9:36] uh dominate the Earth the way God would
[9:39] do things is the way the Earth is going
[9:41] to be run the way that God sees things
[9:43] is how things are going to be done so
[9:44] for the earth to be full of the
[9:45] knowledge of God it's full of his
[9:47] Perfection and his plans and and his
[9:49] claims the way he is and it so it speaks
[9:52] of a familiarity or an acquaintance with
[9:55] the character of God there's some
[9:57] intimate understanding of the will of
[9:59] God to have the mind of God is to know
[10:01] what he wants done with the word to have
[10:03] the mind of God is to know the will of
[10:05] God that's that's what always says the
[10:06] knowledge of the Lord it says Ah this is
[10:08] God's thoughts towards that this is what
[10:10] God would want done this is how God sees
[10:13] things and as we've read this several
[10:15] times I want you to catch this the Earth
[10:17] shall be full of the knowledge of the
[10:18] Lord and brother B says now compare what
[10:21] we see with our own eyes what God has
[10:23] done to redeem his world he's done the
[10:25] same plan to redeem his people compare
[10:28] with our own eyes to see what he's done
[10:30] to redeem the world he's done the same
[10:32] thing to redeem his uh his people and so
[10:35] Earth's Redemption produces a perfect
[10:37] Paradise no sin no sickness no death no
[10:41] fear no doubt it's full of Glory it's
[10:42] full of light it's full of the knowledge
[10:44] of the Lord and as we've been looking at
[10:46] Revelations 21 using future home as our
[10:48] example this perfect Eighth Day uh uh
[10:51] that we see
[10:53] in uh uh in in the Scripture it follows
[10:57] that last stage of redemption which
[10:59] brother calls a baptism of fire and it
[11:02] receives its baptism this perfect
[11:04] Kingdom as brother bandam calls it it
[11:05] follows that last stage of redemption
[11:08] that's the Plan of Redemption for the
[11:10] Earth and God's Plan of Redemption for
[11:13] his people if the Earth is going to be
[11:15] in this glorious condition and the Earth
[11:18] is going to have this after its last
[11:20] stage of redemption I want you to think
[11:22] about this our three stages of
[11:24] redemption doesn't even include the
[11:26] change of this
[11:27] body right it's talking about the
[11:29] Redemption of the Soul so the Earth not
[11:31] being a three-part being itself not
[11:33] being a person as you are it in type
[11:36] goes through the justification
[11:37] sanctification the baptism of fire
[11:40] brother just bringing that out of the
[11:41] scripture to see look what the world how
[11:43] the world ends up in this beautiful
[11:44] glorious perfect Kingdom and he shows us
[11:47] this parallel of redemption for the
[11:49] Earth and that's how it ends up in this
[11:51] glorious perfect Kingdom in the end and
[11:54] that's after its baptism of fire now let
[11:56] me ask you who are born again when did
[11:58] you receive your baptism of fire and so
[12:01] that Eighth Day condition that's
[12:02] reflected in future home in Revelations
[12:04] 21 God's Plan of Redemption for us then
[12:07] can produce a glorious Kingdom in our
[12:09] own lives because we've already received
[12:13] that stage of redemption in our
[12:15] souls as we read in Colossians chap 1: 9
[12:19] and 10 for this cause we also since the
[12:21] day we heard it do not cease to pray for
[12:23] you and to desire that you might be
[12:25] filled with the knowledge of his will in
[12:29] all wisdom and spiritual understanding I
[12:31] think this scripture punches enough just
[12:33] with the way that it's written that it
[12:34] doesn't necessarily need different uh
[12:36] the Greek to be brought out of it in
[12:38] different translations and read it
[12:39] through the Amplified and the parallel
[12:41] but it says that you might walk worthy
[12:43] of the Lord into all pleasing being
[12:45] fruitful in every good work and
[12:47] increasing in the knowledge of Goden
[12:50] that you might be filled with the
[12:52] knowledge of his will filled you want to
[12:55] know what filled is just tell your kids
[12:56] that you're going to fill their cup wi
[12:59] with some soda pop a a a and just fill
[13:02] it
[13:03] halfway if you want to know what filled
[13:05] means they're gonna like nah I no you
[13:07] said you were going to fill my cup and
[13:10] so it's this this filling here it says
[13:12] that you might be filled with the
[13:13] knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
[13:16] spiritual understanding this is the
[13:18] knowledge of the Lord and through this
[13:21] process we begin to walk worthy pleasing
[13:23] unto him fruitful in every good work and
[13:26] increasing in the knowledge of God God
[13:29] Amen I believe that you can find this
[13:32] theme throughout the scripture and
[13:33] throughout the message that the purpose
[13:34] of the Holy Spirit just to put it in
[13:37] language maybe that serves my My overall
[13:39] title in this series the purpose of the
[13:41] holy spirit is the ever expansion of the
[13:43] Kingdom in our lives just to continue to
[13:45] expand its Dominion to expand its domain
[13:47] God Saves your soul now we're going to
[13:49] start from there that's home base that's
[13:51] the throne now just to expand and to
[13:53] work out and to grow and increase and
[13:56] this knowledge of his will and all
[13:57] wisdom and spiritual understanding
[13:59] increasing in the knowledge of God
[14:00] fruitful in every good work that's the
[14:02] purpose and the nature of the holy
[14:04] spirit this is how we know that we've
[14:06] been born again is uh not not only has
[14:09] our desires changed but we begin to
[14:10] realize that because of a changed desire
[14:13] our Direction changes and we look back
[14:15] and throughout our ups and downs and
[14:16] whatever's happened we say you know what
[14:18] this has been
[14:19] growing it it the trajectory might all
[14:22] might not just be straight up but you
[14:23] look back and say you know what it's
[14:24] always been growing because that's the
[14:26] nature of the Holy Ghost that's how it
[14:29] works the Bible says in 2 Peter chap
[14:32] 3:18 I I did originally have this at the
[14:34] end of my notes for so if you amen hard
[14:36] enough and loud enough I might just stop
[14:38] here just instinctively because this was
[14:40] my last two last two uh last quote in
[14:43] scripture at the very end and I just
[14:44] felt to move it here but it says but
[14:46] grow in Grace and in the knowledge of
[14:48] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as
[14:51] newborn babes we desire the sincere milk
[14:53] of the word of God that we may grow
[14:55] thereby and as we grow we grow in Grace
[14:57] and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[14:59] Christ this is this is what we do as
[15:01] Believers we grow we increase this is
[15:03] the purpose of the Holy Ghost the
[15:04] expanding of the Kingdom in our lives
[15:07] this statement here I want to come back
[15:09] to it Lord willing in the future brother
[15:12] Braham says and Christ is revealed in
[15:13] his own word that's the thing that's the
[15:16] matter with the message
[15:20] today I mean think about that phrase CU
[15:22] when we say the message today and we
[15:25] would say it this way we would think
[15:27] about people who believe the message
[15:28] kind of like the association of churches
[15:30] and and he uses it in that sense here
[15:33] that's the matter with the message today
[15:35] those who obtain it in their hearts must
[15:36] lay in the presence of the sun to get
[15:40] ripened if we've obtained the message in
[15:42] our hearts if we've obtained the word in
[15:44] our hearts and we've got the word it
[15:46] says we must lay in the presence of the
[15:48] sun to get ripened this is the emphasis
[15:51] lay in the presence of the sun to get
[15:53] ripened you can pick up the message and
[15:55] then let the sun bake all the green out
[15:59] of you making matured Christians think
[16:02] of that greenness that that's young the
[16:04] green can bend and they wave brother ra
[16:06] talks about those young little trees and
[16:08] the wind blowing and and and how they
[16:10] dance and they shout and the old dead
[16:12] trees are they're all mad at the Young
[16:15] trees but guess what those young trees
[16:16] are growing and if they're growing by
[16:18] the life they're not going to become a
[16:20] dead tree but they mature they grow up
[16:22] they increase and brother says we got to
[16:24] be in the presence of the sun to bake
[16:26] all the greenness out of us and hey
[16:29] greenness May mean something for you it
[16:30] may mean something for me but that's
[16:32] what the sunlight is doing in this hour
[16:35] it's baking out
[16:37] greenness even the youthfulness and the
[16:39] immaturity in those things making
[16:41] matured
[16:43] Christians increasing in the knowledge
[16:45] of God so when Isaiah says that we shall
[16:47] be full the whole Earth shall be full of
[16:50] the knowledge of the Lord that the truth
[16:52] contained here in in Isaiah chapter 11
[16:55] is so vast and extremely applicable
[16:59] and I want you to turn to Proverbs
[17:02] 1:7 I want you to but you don't have to
[17:04] it's
[17:05] voluntary it's not compulsory anymore a
[17:08] lot of times turning doesn't make sense
[17:10] I guess you tap and you scroll or you
[17:13] flip you swipe or we just imagine it we
[17:17] just imagine in our minds we just I read
[17:19] the Bible before I got a picture perfect
[17:21] memory let me just
[17:23] browse to Proverbs 1 verse
[17:27] 7
[17:32] I feel this is important to touch on
[17:33] this where knowledge
[17:35] begins this kind of knowledge because to
[17:38] say knowledge is power it may be
[17:40] controversial considering what we're
[17:41] taught in the message what brother Bram
[17:43] says about carnal wisdom and what the
[17:46] Bible warns us about knowledge of man
[17:49] and the intellect of man and
[17:50] intelligence and things that relate to
[17:52] humanity to say knowledge is power and
[17:54] even if we use the Latin it's like
[17:56] science is power it would be even though
[17:58] kind of what it would begin to read to
[17:59] us and we're thinking wait mm we don't
[18:02] want anything about we don't want that
[18:03] and so I want you to understand the
[18:04] knowledge I'm talking about has a
[18:06] beginning says the fear of the Lord is
[18:08] the beginning of knowledge but fools
[18:10] despise wisdom and
[18:12] instruction we can get sidetracked
[18:14] talking about the fools who despise
[18:16] wisdom and instruction but I want to
[18:18] focus on the fear of the Lord is the
[18:20] beginning of knowledge this is the
[18:21] reverence and obedience to God without
[18:24] which all other knowledge is
[18:27] vain now I want you to make sure that
[18:29] that's been entered into the record when
[18:31] you think about knowledge is power that
[18:33] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[18:34] knowledge if we do not have the reverent
[18:36] reverential fear of God and the respect
[18:38] for God that love for God then all other
[18:40] knowledge is vain so the fear of the
[18:42] Lord is the beginning of true knowledge
[18:44] but to the fools those who are
[18:46] indifferent to God and His word they do
[18:48] not they do not desire the knowledge of
[18:51] God they're IND different about it you
[18:53] try try to even those who claim to love
[18:56] God and love his word and and and and
[18:57] have received the word of God you try to
[18:59] show them in the word of God something
[19:01] they don't want to know the word of God
[19:02] they want their own ideas they want
[19:04] their own Traditions they want their own
[19:06] uh uh whatever it might be their bent or
[19:08] their taste and so it's the fool who
[19:10] despises wisdom and instruction and
[19:12] they're kind of cold on the word of God
[19:15] they do not desire the knowledge of God
[19:16] but the fear of the Lord is the
[19:17] beginning of knowledge says in Proverbs
[19:20] chapter 9: 9 and 10 give instruction to
[19:22] a wise man and he will be yet wiser
[19:26] teach a just man and he will increase in
[19:29] learning the fear of the Lord I think
[19:31] that's a beautiful statement I wanted to
[19:33] have that uh in our minds just how we
[19:35] can increase the wise increase the just
[19:38] increase in this wisdom and learning the
[19:41] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[19:44] wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is
[19:47] understanding the knowledge of the Holy
[19:49] is understanding so we talk about
[19:51] knowledge and understanding or we say
[19:53] the knowledge of the Holy is
[19:55] understanding we talk about having
[19:56] understanding it's not so much about
[19:57] scientific princip principles in the
[19:59] nature of man and how how uh how the the
[20:03] periodic table and formulas and all
[20:05] sorts of things that relate to uh
[20:07] Academia it's not that kind of
[20:09] understanding oh I know how a car works
[20:11] or I know how the this happens and I
[20:12] know how Nutrition Works I know these
[20:14] processes and I know these things I I I
[20:17] figured out how to use AI or I figured
[20:19] out how to use data analytics and these
[20:21] different things that's not the
[20:22] understanding that we're talking about
[20:24] but it's talking about knowledge of the
[20:26] Holy now that's understanding to have
[20:28] knowledge of of God to have knowledge of
[20:30] divine things now that's understanding
[20:33] would it not be true that if you had the
[20:35] mind of God that you would be in a
[20:36] position to understand anything God
[20:39] having been the creator of all things
[20:41] and he's the original scientist in that
[20:43] way and he's the one that brought
[20:45] everything forth he knows the
[20:47] composition of things he knows how
[20:48] things interact and react he knows knows
[20:51] the cause of things he knows the end of
[20:52] things he knows the beginning of things
[20:54] that's that's real
[20:56] understanding amen
[20:58] Psalm 111:10 the fear of the Lord is the
[21:01] beginning of wisdom nowhere this wisdom
[21:03] and knowledge and understanding where
[21:05] it's rooted a good understanding have
[21:07] all they that do his Commandments his
[21:10] praise endureth forever those that do
[21:13] his Commandments are said to have a good
[21:15] understanding now we could say the
[21:17] chicken or the egg is it because they
[21:19] have a good understanding they do his
[21:21] Commandments or they do as Commandments
[21:22] and they're given a good understanding
[21:24] well you could break out and try to
[21:25] figure that out but I would say this
[21:26] it's assumed that if someone doing the
[21:28] will of God they got understanding if
[21:31] they're doing the will of God they have
[21:32] a good understanding and because they
[21:34] there's some there's some acknowledgment
[21:36] of this works and this is why it works
[21:38] and this is why we do it and so we can
[21:41] never have true knowledge if we do not
[21:43] begin with
[21:44] God who is the Fountain of all
[21:47] knowledge so this speaks to say that the
[21:51] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[21:52] knowledge when we talk about
[21:54] knowledge knowledge then in this respect
[21:56] it speaks of our minds being influenced
[21:58] by the fear of God and the love of God
[22:01] being influenced by the respect for God
[22:03] not a vain knowledge not a knowledge
[22:05] disconnected from God but a knowledge
[22:08] that is inspired by and informed by and
[22:10] influenced by our love for God and our
[22:12] respect to
[22:14] God in 1 Corinthians chapter 8
[22:24] verse1 now as touching things offered
[22:27] unto idols
[22:30] and
[22:33] I I'll say it this way Paul is is
[22:36] dealing with different levels of
[22:39] understanding uh things offered under
[22:41] Idols people that might eat something
[22:42] offered under an idol uh what and kind
[22:46] of that whole that whole issue and so he
[22:49] says as things offered under Idols he
[22:51] says we know that we all have knowledge
[22:53] so he's acknowledg we know these things
[22:56] these are things that we know he goes
[22:58] knowledge puffeth up but charity
[23:01] edifieth and the knowledge he's talking
[23:03] about here would be a a knowledge that's
[23:05] disconnected from God disconnected from
[23:08] the mind of God the will of God the
[23:10] purpose of God and a knowledge without
[23:12] love Is Just puffed up there's no
[23:13] substance there it's posturing if I
[23:16] could say it this way that when
[23:17] something puffs up trying to present
[23:19] itself as bigger trying to present
[23:21] itself as something that it's not it
[23:23] fills itself with air when something's
[23:24] puffed up you fill yourself with air and
[23:27] you get Ed up and you might look bigger
[23:29] and you might sound bad and you might
[23:30] you might appear to be bigger and Bolder
[23:32] but when the air is let out oh well
[23:34] that's really what it is and so it has
[23:36] something to do with posturing this kind
[23:37] of knowledge disconnected from love puff
[23:40] Puffs up whereas charity has substance
[23:43] to it it can add to it looks to edify so
[23:46] the kind of knowledge that we're talking
[23:48] about is a knowledge that is connected
[23:50] with God not disconnected from God in
[23:52] anything that we might have in our minds
[23:54] that we understand and we have all
[23:56] knowledge of the message and we have all
[23:57] knowledge of the church or we have all
[23:59] knowledge of what brother M taught about
[24:00] certain things if it doesn't come back
[24:02] to a fear and reverence for God instead
[24:05] of a reverence for appearance and a
[24:06] reverence for Optics and a reverence for
[24:08] certain things and the way they look
[24:10] then that's the kind of knowledge that
[24:12] puffs up but there's a kind of knowledge
[24:14] that's connected with the love of God
[24:16] that builds
[24:18] up so the fear of the Lord is the
[24:21] beginning of knowledge the beginning of
[24:26] wisdom and
[24:29] knowing and this is just advancing a
[24:31] step further knowing this Foundation of
[24:36] knowledge I believe it's easier for us
[24:38] to appreciate the power of
[24:41] knowledge that when we speak of true
[24:43] knowledge and he that has a good
[24:45] understanding uh they do his
[24:47] Commandments and that the fear of the
[24:49] Lord is the beginning of knowledge that
[24:50] if I Fear God I reverence God I love God
[24:52] there's this kind of
[24:53] piety difference to him it's not it's
[24:56] not a dread it's not oh god he's a he's
[24:58] a fearsome God and he's a he's tough
[25:01] he's strict he's severe uh if you don't
[25:03] want to go to hell you better do what he
[25:04] says it's not that it's the
[25:06] reverence respect is to be in awe of him
[25:08] to have some man I love this guy and I I
[25:12] and I respect him and I it's that's the
[25:14] kind of feeling when you have this about
[25:15] God like man I love him I respect him I
[25:18] I'm in awe of him I acknowledge his
[25:20] greatness and his power there's a the
[25:22] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[25:23] that
[25:24] knowledge if we if we if that's where
[25:27] knowledge is coming from then that tells
[25:30] us there's power to this
[25:32] knowledge and I'm going to start with uh
[25:34] this a scripture that just kind of kicks
[25:36] the door open on where I'm wanting to
[25:38] focus in Hosea 4:6 my people are
[25:42] destroyed for lack of
[25:44] knowledge my people are destroyed for
[25:47] lack of knowledge because thou Hast
[25:49] rejected knowledge I will also reject
[25:52] thee that thou shalt be no priest to me
[25:55] I should mean something to us when we
[25:57] profess that we're going to be made
[25:58] Kings and Priests or that we are right
[26:00] now made Kings and Priests so there's a
[26:02] duty to a priest there's a duty in this
[26:04] priesthood says that you destroyed for a
[26:07] lack of knowledge so that's a statement
[26:08] that stands on its own and now he gets
[26:10] into this because you've rejected
[26:11] knowledge I'll reject you you will not
[26:13] be a priest to me seeing thou Hast
[26:15] forgotten the law of thy God I will also
[26:18] forget thy children
[26:21] woo because you have forgotten the law
[26:24] of God I will also forget thy children
[26:29] the Bible says in Psalms 1978 the law of
[26:31] the Lord is perfect converting the soul
[26:34] The Testament of the Lord is sure making
[26:36] wise the simple this is what they
[26:38] rejected when they forgot the law of the
[26:39] Lord they forgot the very thing that's
[26:41] perfect and converts the soul the very
[26:43] thing that makes simple a wise the
[26:45] simple the statutes of the Lord are
[26:47] right rejoice in the heart the
[26:49] Commandment of the Lord is pure
[26:50] enlightening the
[26:52] eyes this is what they had forsaken to
[26:55] say that they were destroyed for lack of
[26:57] of knowledge and because they rejected
[26:59] knowledge he rejects them they had
[27:01] forgotten the law of God therefore God
[27:03] says I'll forget your children I made
[27:04] you a promise there was something sure
[27:06] that if you would just pursue the word
[27:08] of God pursue the law of God there were
[27:09] certain promises attached to it but now
[27:12] you will be no priest to me and in
[27:15] Malachi 2:7 it says for the priest's
[27:18] lips should keep knowledge and they
[27:20] should seek the law at his mouth for he
[27:23] is the messenger of the Lord of hosts
[27:26] this is the responsibility of a priest
[27:27] which you ought to make yourself in type
[27:29] one where it says the priest lips should
[27:32] keep knowledge that means knowledge
[27:33] should be on your lips that's why we got
[27:35] to be so careful with what we repeat and
[27:37] the things we read the things we hear
[27:39] the things that's in the news the things
[27:40] that we share with other people the
[27:42] speculations we make about things and
[27:44] events and people because these lips
[27:46] ought to keep knowledge they should seek
[27:49] the law at his mouth because he's a
[27:51] messenger of the Lord of hosts and what
[27:54] God is rebuking even in Malachi and
[27:55] Hosea is is not not the children but the
[27:58] parents and the priesthood and those who
[28:00] ought to have kept the knowledge of God
[28:02] on their lips those who ought to have
[28:04] sought the the law of God out his mouth
[28:06] they had not done so they had rejected
[28:09] the word they had rejected
[28:12] knowledge my people are destroyed for a
[28:15] lack of
[28:17] knowledge a lack of knowledge has
[28:19] nothing to do with just data but
[28:23] discernment the lack of knowledge here
[28:25] is perception they lacked WID
[28:28] wisdom the wisdom of Solomon was it to
[28:30] be able to say well there's a mom and a
[28:32] mom two alleged moms and one um one baby
[28:36] the the wisdom of Solon wasn't to tell
[28:37] you what was to read the room in the
[28:40] sense that well I got one here that does
[28:41] this and one that does that and this
[28:43] claiming this the wisdom of Solon was
[28:45] above and had an insight as to how he
[28:47] could provoke these two people in
[28:50] particular and knew it was
[28:53] discernment was it not
[28:55] discernment because there's certain
[28:56] situations where you could have a a mom
[29:00] who doesn't like their baby at all and
[29:01] one who does and and and is just trying
[29:04] to get rid of the baby and it's a big
[29:05] huge confusion he said well go ahead and
[29:06] cut the baby in half and the real mom
[29:08] says go for
[29:10] it right there had to be some wisdom on
[29:14] the situation which was discernment
[29:16] perception this is what it means to have
[29:18] the L knowledge of God or this lack of
[29:20] knowledge that's being called out here
[29:21] in Hosea is a lack of understanding and
[29:23] wisdom perception
[29:24] discernment knowledge isn't knowing
[29:26] information or facts but as I think as
[29:30] we've said this before it's the anal
[29:31] it's the the right kind of analysis to
[29:34] understand it you've got a lot of facts
[29:36] you got a lot of
[29:37] data and and I we could hand we can do
[29:39] your blood work and we could hand you
[29:41] all the results of the blood work and go
[29:42] okay well this is that and this is that
[29:44] and this is that and might even be able
[29:45] to tell it just by the way they do the
[29:47] chart that this is out of range and
[29:48] that's out of range and this is that way
[29:49] and that's that way but you'll still
[29:51] find that they have tools that analyze
[29:53] all that data to tell you whether or not
[29:55] there actually is a problem right
[29:58] because it's not just a matter of
[29:59] collecting the information but it's the
[30:01] analysis to understand it and then use
[30:03] it which is exactly what Paul is calling
[30:05] out in 1 Corinthians 8 he says we all
[30:08] have knowledge but you don't know how to
[30:09] use it we all have knowledge that about
[30:12] things sacrificed to Idols we know that
[30:13] it's not right we know there that we
[30:15] shouldn't do this we know we shouldn't
[30:16] do that but you use it carnally and
[30:19] you're going to do things to cause
[30:20] another brother to stumble and you're
[30:21] going to do things to cause some to
[30:23] offend somebody else and you're going to
[30:24] do this say you have no wisdom right
[30:27] right you have no real knowledge that's
[30:29] not just to know something but to
[30:32] actually understand the why in the use
[30:34] of
[30:35] something and he said and if I could put
[30:38] it this way it's the difference between
[30:40] data collection and data
[30:42] analytics and sister Morgan I cleared
[30:44] this with brother Michael before I used
[30:46] it uh he's our data analytics guy at
[30:48] least he presents himself as that he
[30:50] does a pretty good job but and the data
[30:53] collection it it concerns itself with
[30:55] collecting and measuring yes
[30:58] going to take the temperature we want to
[30:59] count the beans we want to and it's all
[31:01] about Gathering and and that's what it
[31:03] that's what it does data collection get
[31:04] the uh uh collect it collect it and now
[31:07] there has to be some a a way that your
[31:10] data collection is done the right way so
[31:11] that you know you're collecting the
[31:12] right kind of things if you're
[31:13] collecting beans you don't want to start
[31:15] counting
[31:16] rocks and so there is some there is some
[31:18] standards to that but that's not all
[31:20] that's meant in the knowledge of the
[31:22] lord it's not just collecting and
[31:23] measuring but there's the analytics
[31:25] which data analytics concerns itself
[31:26] with the analysis of it the
[31:28] interpretation of it to understand it in
[31:31] order to use
[31:32] it and and I think I wouldn't be
[31:35] dismissive of the collection part
[31:36] because as brother Michael pointed out
[31:38] to me that your analysis is only going
[31:40] to be as good as your collection but the
[31:43] collection could be perfect but without
[31:44] the analysis you don't get the use of it
[31:47] what does it mean to know that we've got
[31:49] this much and we've got that much and
[31:50] this is what it is and this is how we
[31:52] measure it and this is what was said you
[31:53] need the mind to come behind it to be
[31:55] able to know not what God Said but what
[31:58] he wants done with what he said because
[32:00] we have the mind of Christ to know what
[32:03] he wants done with his word not just to
[32:05] know what he said and to know what his
[32:07] word is but to know the use of it the
[32:09] application and the placing of
[32:13] it I I think I've seen this more and
[32:15] more how the people are destroyed for
[32:18] the lack of
[32:22] knowledge we got the message at our
[32:25] fingertips to be able to run it and
[32:27] search and run a quote to print out
[32:29] every quote print out you know copy and
[32:32] paste every quote into a digital
[32:33] document I what brother BR had to say
[32:35] about a particular instance or situation
[32:39] or teaching and we can know what he said
[32:42] but have no knowledge of how to
[32:45] practically apply that and what it ought
[32:47] to look
[32:50] like it says my people are
[32:53] destroyed means caus to cease means to
[32:56] perish to be cut off from God the the
[33:00] this the people are destroyed at the
[33:02] word picture that's formed in the
[33:04] Hebrews are read be brought to
[33:06] silence there's they're ineffective they
[33:09] can't they don't speak for God anymore
[33:11] there there the Hebrews were to be God's
[33:14] chosen people they they were people to
[33:16] look at them and think of their God yes
[33:19] and they were to express the one true
[33:21] God and their voice was to articulate
[33:23] the greatness of the one true God the
[33:25] way they live the way they acted where
[33:26] they live what they supported what they
[33:28] worshiped how they worship was to all
[33:29] declare the true God he says my people
[33:31] are destroyed for the lack of knowledge
[33:34] they've been brought to silence they
[33:36] profaned me with their lives their lives
[33:38] can no longer speak of my character what
[33:40] they pursue can no longer speak of my
[33:42] vision they're completely they've ceased
[33:44] to be what I've called them to
[33:47] be he says they're destroyed for lack of
[33:51] knowledge in Proverbs 1: 27 28 and 29
[33:55] we're looking at the power wanting to
[33:57] appreciate the power of knowledge and
[33:59] maybe we're doing this by the inversion
[34:02] it says when your fear cometh as
[34:03] desolation and your destruction cometh
[34:06] as a whirlwind when distress and anguish
[34:08] cometh upon you then shall they call
[34:11] upon me but I will not
[34:13] answer they shall seek me early but they
[34:16] shall not find me I'll just Ponder this
[34:19] for a little bit in that black and white
[34:21] and the font that I use which is what
[34:23] the highway system uses for their signs
[34:25] for easy reading
[34:28] little little inside information there
[34:30] my clear view font I think it's 2B or
[34:32] something like that but just look at
[34:35] this when fear come comes as desolation
[34:39] your destruction comes as a whirlwind
[34:41] your distress and anguish come upon you
[34:44] it's in this moment that we kind of
[34:46] expect then I will hear and I will
[34:48] rescue you and I will shelter you under
[34:51] my that's what we want to read he goes
[34:53] then shall they call upon me and I will
[34:56] not answer answer wouldn't that be a
[34:58] horrible typo he says I will not answer
[35:01] they shall seek me early isn't that what
[35:03] they're supposed to do but they shall
[35:05] not find me get that image in your mind
[35:07] right now and look at the condition of
[35:09] the people fears come as desolation
[35:12] destruction as a whirlwind distress and
[35:14] anguish are upon him and now what they
[35:16] ought to do is call upon him and what
[35:18] they should do is do it quick and do it
[35:20] early and God said I won't answer and
[35:22] you won't find me you want to know why
[35:24] in verse 29 for that they hated
[35:26] knowledge and did not choose to fear the
[35:29] lord why did their Destruction come
[35:32] because they hated knowledge why did
[35:34] their desolation come because they hated
[35:36] knowledge why did they have distress and
[35:38] anguish because they hated knowledge and
[35:40] they did not choose to fear the lord
[35:42] that's why in their moment of distress
[35:44] oh now they want to call upon the Lord
[35:47] if I could say this your anxiety and
[35:49] your distress and your anguish and your
[35:50] desolation and destruction it it may
[35:53] come upon you but if it is upon you
[35:56] because you you didn't fear God that's
[35:57] what he's saying if you don't fear God
[35:59] and you hate knowledge that's when
[36:00] you're in trouble but if you have these
[36:03] things in your life if you fear God if
[36:05] you had love knowledge that's when he'll
[36:07] hear you that's when you seek him early
[36:10] you'll find
[36:11] them Hallelujah just invert the truth in
[36:14] this scripture when your fear comes on
[36:16] you and your Destruction come as a
[36:18] whirlwind and your distress and anguish
[36:19] come upon you will you when you call
[36:21] upon me I'll answer when you seek me
[36:23] early you'll find me because you love
[36:25] knowledge and you chose to fear me
[36:29] Hallelujah think of
[36:32] this and these scriptures speak of The
[36:34] Perils of
[36:40] ignorance never
[36:42] underestimate the devil's desire to keep
[36:45] you
[36:46] ignorant so he can just shove anything
[36:48] he wants down your throat and you'll
[36:50] just swallow it in the name of the
[36:54] message these scriptures are speaking
[36:56] about The Perils of
[36:58] ignorance the lack of knowledge creates
[37:01] a
[37:02] void that's only going to be filled by
[37:08] unrighteousness my people are destroyed
[37:10] for lack of knowledge watch how this
[37:11] chapter opens in hosiah 4: 1 and 2 hear
[37:14] the word of the Lord ye children of
[37:17] Israel for the Lord hath the controversy
[37:20] with the inhabitants of the
[37:22] land remember verse six says my people
[37:24] are destroyed for the lack of knowledge
[37:26] they rejected knowledge and they forgot
[37:28] the law and notice with the
[37:30] description because there is no truth
[37:32] nor Mercy nor knowledge of God In the
[37:34] Land by swearing and lying and killing
[37:38] and stealing and committing adultery
[37:40] they break out and blood toucheth blood
[37:44] these are the devastating effects of the
[37:45] lack of
[37:47] knowledge there's no truth no mercy no
[37:49] knowledge of God in the land therefore
[37:50] it's swearing lying killing stealing
[37:52] committing adultery there's a breaking
[37:54] out and blood toucheth blood the the
[37:57] this is the Perils of ignorance where
[37:59] there's ignorance where there's a lack
[38:01] of knowledge where there's not a love
[38:02] for knowledge and a choosing to fear the
[38:04] lord and I'm talking about the true
[38:05] knowledge this is what gives rise to
[38:08] these very things of swearing and lying
[38:10] and killing and stealing and committing
[38:13] adultery the lack of knowledge creates a
[38:15] void that Humanity will fill the lack of
[38:18] knowledge creates a Chasm that carnality
[38:20] will fill the lack of knowledge creates
[38:22] all these crevices and all these spots
[38:24] and all these holes and all these blind
[38:26] spots that the carnal mind wants to fill
[38:29] I believe I was I was fellowshipping
[38:31] with brother Andrew and then even
[38:32] felling with brother Paula Fontaine over
[38:34] the weekend on some of the same things
[38:36] and and how that it's man has a
[38:39] desire that if there's a loop we always
[38:41] want to close it right we don't like
[38:44] open-ended things we we want to explain
[38:46] things we want to close loops and
[38:47] sometimes it's just an insatiable
[38:48] appetite to be able to figure it all out
[38:50] and button it up and make clear things
[38:52] and the mind has got a really sneaky
[38:54] trick that it'll do that where there's a
[38:56] blank spot your mind will fill it in
[38:58] with the information that's around it
[38:59] thinking that's good enough that's what
[39:01] happens in your peripheral vision
[39:03] there's a blind spot in all of our eyes
[39:05] that there's actually there's no there's
[39:07] no sight whatsoever there your brain is
[39:10] receiving no information but your brain
[39:12] instead of just giving you a DOT fills
[39:14] in that spot with the information that's
[39:16] around it and I think a lot of people
[39:18] start to do that with the things of God
[39:20] they come to a blank spot and they just
[39:22] want to fill in the blank spot with all
[39:23] the information that's around it and
[39:25] they produce a picture in their mind and
[39:27] not the mind of God because in God there
[39:30] are no blank spots you may not see it
[39:32] all because he doesn't want to show it
[39:34] to you and just be happy with the spots
[39:36] you can't see and ask God to give you
[39:38] his mind that fills in the
[39:43] spots good because our carnal Minds when
[39:47] they're darkened and they're blackened
[39:49] something's going to fill it
[39:51] up and it's not it's it's it's usually
[39:54] not good but some what akin to this no
[39:57] Truth No Mercy swearing lying killing
[39:59] stealing committing adultery and break
[40:03] out Romans 1:21 I hope this isn't too
[40:06] much of a just of an outlier here but to
[40:09] me it just has a has the same emphasis
[40:12] because they that when they knew God so
[40:15] they have some knowledge right there's
[40:17] they knew God not that they had the mind
[40:19] of God but they knew God says they
[40:21] glorified him not as God neither were
[40:24] thankful this lack of gratitude and not
[40:26] glorifying him as God in beginning
[40:28] because that's where the fear of the
[40:29] Lord be is to glorify God to be gra this
[40:32] gratitude and the fear of the Lord is
[40:34] the beginning of knowledge so they knew
[40:35] God but they did not begin in the fear
[40:37] of God therefore they never had true
[40:39] knowledge of God but became vain in
[40:42] their imaginations and their foolish
[40:44] heart was
[40:46] darkened it's through the lack of
[40:48] knowledge what's next when they when you
[40:50] know God but you do not fear God then it
[40:52] produces vain imaginations and your
[40:54] Foolish Heart Is darkened and so through
[40:56] the lack of knowledge or Not a Love of
[40:58] the truth that vanity comes in pride
[41:01] comes in a man is driven by prideful
[41:03] ambition he's driven by his emotions
[41:05] he's driven by pretense he's driven by
[41:07] all these other things and he'll present
[41:09] a certain way and it doesn't mean he has
[41:11] to be swear and lying stealing and
[41:13] committing adultery literally in the
[41:14] flesh but he can have all those same
[41:16] markers spiritually all those same
[41:18] markers in other subtle ways why because
[41:21] the mind is not full of the knowledge of
[41:23] God but it's filled in all the blank
[41:25] spots en closed all the loops in a
[41:27] carnal mind and now it's chasing after
[41:30] things and has an agenda that's not
[41:35] pure you
[41:37] can kind of track the Thessalonians and
[41:42] the having received the love of the
[41:43] truth to love truth it's the fear of God
[41:47] and God being truth that there's this
[41:49] there's this love the seeking after
[41:51] it we should seek the law at his mouth
[41:54] we should our lips should keep kn
[41:58] knowledge it's the the law of the Lord
[42:00] the Commandment of the Lord is pure
[42:01] enlightening the eyes this is what
[42:03] they've rejected so their imaginations
[42:04] become Vain and their foolish heart is
[42:06] darkened there's no Enlightenment
[42:09] there in Isaiah chapter 60 verse two I'm
[42:12] referring to this just knowing that you
[42:14] all are such a privilege to preach to
[42:16] such uh mature message Believers have
[42:20] had decades on in good teaching and in
[42:22] the message of the hour so you'll know
[42:23] just how important this scripture is cuz
[42:26] verse one is arise Shine for thy light
[42:28] is come and verse two for Behold The
[42:30] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[42:32] Darkness the people now I'm drawing from
[42:35] uh there's a man here who can turn on
[42:36] the light the Shalom sermons and those
[42:38] different places there at the end of 63
[42:39] and beginning of 64 even preached right
[42:41] here in Arizona uh and Phoenix these
[42:44] different things where he's talking
[42:45] about this the scripture and he's making
[42:47] it relevant to the end time and he's
[42:49] speaking about how Darkness has covered
[42:50] the Earth and gross Darkness has covered
[42:52] the people so there's a spiritual
[42:55] Darkness upon the Earth but an even
[42:56] greater darkness in the people that's
[42:59] right and it's a darkness of spiritual
[43:01] understanding he's telling us he
[43:02] pointing us out that there's a there's
[43:04] been a there's a there's a lack of an
[43:07] understanding of the word of God and
[43:09] because they do not understand the word
[43:11] of God because if we get back on it they
[43:13] do not fear God therefore they do not
[43:14] know God therefore they do not
[43:15] understand God therefore they do not
[43:16] know his will and it just leads to chaos
[43:19] right even if it's religion it leads to
[43:22] chaos even if they're trying to be
[43:24] spiritual it leads to car ity because
[43:27] they haven't begun in the fear of the
[43:28] Lord because they have not kept
[43:30] knowledge with their lips because they
[43:32] have not sought the word at his mouth
[43:33] because the word isn't what has
[43:35] preeminence because they don't believe
[43:36] it's the word and the word only they got
[43:38] to fill it in with other things and in
[43:40] filling in with other things it leads to
[43:41] carnality it leads to chaos it leads to
[43:43] spiritual adultery in a lot of cases it
[43:45] leads to the actual adultery and it
[43:47] leads to worldliness and letting go of
[43:49] the standards and things because they
[43:51] put up a different kind of image of what
[43:53] it's supposed to be and they don't have
[43:55] the life behind
[44:00] it this is exactly what brother Bram is
[44:03] calling out in the church
[44:04] world at this
[44:06] time and he says in the message Shalom
[44:09] he says the church ages are fading out
[44:11] God has pressing the darkness into a
[44:13] place it has to do it to fade out the
[44:15] church organizations Fade Out the world
[44:18] I love that CU think of this he says the
[44:20] world is covering the thing over and
[44:23] worldism has took the whole thing then
[44:25] isn't God right by worldly things and
[44:28] worldly dressing and worldly acting and
[44:30] worldly living it's the
[44:33] world this is what's happening in the
[44:36] church brother br's diagnosing this a
[44:38] prophet's telling us what's happened
[44:39] he's saying Darkness covers the earth
[44:41] gross Darkness the people it settled
[44:43] into the church Le DEA is Darkness he's
[44:46] referring to Revelations chapter 3 it's
[44:48] gross Darkness upon the people the the
[44:50] the the the light has been blackened out
[44:53] there's no more light left in the church
[44:55] Christ has been rejected Christ has been
[44:57] put out it's Darkness it's chaos it's
[44:58] descended into the pit and brother tells
[45:01] us all these things that are happening
[45:02] all the while they are the church is
[45:05] continuing to worship God they're still
[45:08] going to church they're still preaching
[45:10] Jesus Christ the Pentecost are still
[45:11] baptizing in Jesus name it's not that
[45:13] they've rejected religion and they've
[45:16] rejected the name they're continuing on
[45:18] but brother and sister look at them it's
[45:19] worldly look at the worldliness look at
[45:21] the darkness look at the darkness and
[45:23] he's calling it out and it's because the
[45:24] gross Darkness is the result of a vain
[45:27] imagination we can bring it's because
[45:29] they had rejected
[45:30] Christ but he says you are not of the
[45:33] world Little Children You are of Heaven
[45:35] this is not your home this sin loving
[45:38] world this church World these these
[45:40] organizations these religions all these
[45:42] things all the carnality all the
[45:44] pretense all the pride all the darkness
[45:46] all the worldism that's not your home he
[45:49] says you are of heaven and I love this
[45:51] he says God is pressing the darkness to
[45:53] a place to fade out the world
[45:56] think of that he's pressing the darkness
[45:58] to a place to fade out the world that's
[46:00] what God's wanting to do in your life
[46:02] he's pressing aside the darkness to fade
[46:04] out the world press it away press it
[46:07] away press it away than you
[46:10] Lord they had rejected him we're
[46:13] anointed by accepting him and they had
[46:17] rejected
[46:18] him what is it result in the increase of
[46:21] sin why why is it so bad in Leo deia
[46:24] they rejected Christ right they rejected
[46:27] knowledge they rejected him so it leads
[46:29] to wickedness and
[46:31] sin job CH 28:
[46:34] 28 and unto man he said behold the fear
[46:38] of the Lord that is
[46:44] wisdom and to depart from Evil is
[46:50] understanding that that's a good that's
[46:52] a good summing isn't it the fear of the
[46:55] Lord that's Wis wisdom you want to know
[46:56] who's wise somebody who reverences God
[46:58] somebody who fears God respects his word
[47:01] somebody who looks at the word of God
[47:02] and says you know what I I wouldn't want
[47:04] to transgress that I wouldn't want to
[47:06] take away from that I wouldn't want to
[47:08] add to that I wouldn't want to make them
[47:11] fight each
[47:12] other that that's that that's when
[47:14] someone has some wisdom is they fear the
[47:16] Lord amen and they trust God yes there's
[47:20] a lot of things that happen remember one
[47:22] time a brother shared with me know kind
[47:24] of his reasons for something
[47:26] and his I guess I could just be real
[47:29] open and honest CU it's not like anyone
[47:31] of you would know who I'm talking about
[47:33] but he he basically was wanting to
[47:35] reject the principle of predestination
[47:37] because how much people misused
[47:40] it I don't like how people misuse
[47:43] predestination they just use
[47:44] predestination as an excuse and and and
[47:47] that's somebody looking at a problem and
[47:49] saying wow here's a truth of God and
[47:53] people are abusing it and misusing it
[47:55] now this is just me all right but wisdom
[47:57] would be like that's wrong but the
[48:00] word's right they're wrong to misuse it
[48:03] but the word's right and I just have to
[48:06] trust God that his word is the way that
[48:09] it is and if people misunderstand it
[48:11] he'll deal with their hearts
[48:12] appropriately and whatever I can do to
[48:14] lift up the truth of that to help them
[48:16] to understand it and see it that would
[48:18] be wisdom now this is just me talking to
[48:21] me what's not wisdom is to say oh you're
[48:23] going to misuse it well then there's no
[48:24] such thing as predestination right right
[48:26] to completely just change it because the
[48:29] way people are abusing it and do that
[48:31] with any Doctrine in the word of God say
[48:33] oh I don't like the way what people have
[48:34] made out of it well look what they've
[48:35] made out of Christ look what they've
[48:37] made out of Christ do we do away with
[48:39] him because of the nonsense no we
[48:41] appreciate the truth of it more look
[48:43] what they've made out of the message
[48:45] look how they've crucified the word
[48:47] again are we ashamed of it no do we try
[48:49] to change it would we reject it no why
[48:52] because the fear of the Lord is the
[48:54] beginning of wisdom to fear God that is
[48:57] wisdom and to depart from Evil is
[49:03] understanding I I think there's
[49:06] a it's kind of just what's in the maybe
[49:09] The Ether here for me as I digest these
[49:12] things that just that simple Christian
[49:14] Life can be so
[49:16] devalued where it's like ah well you
[49:18] know that's just the that's legalism
[49:21] that's Clos line you know what does that
[49:24] matter and I'm just being and I think I
[49:26] have I've been repeating this theme
[49:27] quite a bit in this series so it's not
[49:29] like this is something
[49:30] new but how we live how we act how we
[49:34] treat one another how we love our our
[49:36] wives and and how we pay our bills and
[49:39] and pay our taxes and all just honesty
[49:41] and decent living and cleanliness and
[49:43] applying the token and Holiness and
[49:45] modesty all those things these things
[49:47] matter we should know enough to know
[49:49] it's not just if we do all that we're
[49:51] right but if we have the Holy Ghost
[49:53] shouldn't we do that shouldn't we do do
[49:55] it and then to distill it down to where
[49:56] we're kind of bottling up the bride's uh
[49:59] uh interaction with the word of God down
[50:01] to a church service and what takes place
[50:03] between be among four walls fine kick
[50:05] the walls down and do it out in the
[50:06] parking lot that's still not it that's
[50:09] still not it and we so trivialized the
[50:12] life behind
[50:14] it we can't do
[50:17] that because to depart from Evil that's
[50:21] understanding Bible tells us to good
[50:23] understanding have all they that do his
[50:24] Commandments
[50:26] should we not with all our getting get
[50:29] understanding yes does it make a little
[50:30] bit of sense now why the proverb would
[50:32] tell you with all your getting get
[50:33] understanding why because to depart from
[50:35] Evil is understanding with all my
[50:37] getting the more understanding I get the
[50:39] less evil has hold over
[50:42] me ow if I could just take a step
[50:45] further
[50:46] then they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[50:48] all my Holy
[50:49] Mountain this ISS Isaiah
[50:51] 11:9 for the Earth shall be full of the
[50:54] knowledge of the Lord as the waters
[50:55] cover the
[50:58] sea so the Earth is full of the
[51:00] knowledge of the lord we just took some
[51:02] time beginning with the fear of the Lord
[51:04] is the beginning of knowledge and how
[51:05] the lack of knowledge causes sin could I
[51:08] summarize the last whatever however
[51:10] minutes that was 30 minutes in that way
[51:12] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[51:13] knowledge so that's knowledge and
[51:15] knowledge the lack of knowledge causes
[51:18] sin yes wickedness lying stealing all
[51:20] these things all the depravity and now
[51:23] the the scripture says the Earth Earth
[51:25] is full of the knowledge of the
[51:28] Lord the Earth is full of the knowledge
[51:30] of the Lord that has a consequence but
[51:32] let's look at how this happens look at
[51:33] Isaiah 11
[51:37] verse1 I'm going to go through this
[51:41] quickly and if the Lord wants us to go
[51:44] into this a little bit more which is a
[51:45] lot here to do we'll do but I just want
[51:48] to bring out something very simple in
[51:49] this in this closing
[51:51] thought and there shall come forth a rod
[51:56] out of the stem of Jesse and the branch
[51:59] shall grow out of his roots remember
[52:01] what we read in verse 10 these are the
[52:02] book ends then to everything we're
[52:04] reading between verse two and verse 9
[52:06] verse 9 the Earth shall be full the
[52:07] knowledge of the Lord as the waters
[52:08] covers the sea and in that day there
[52:09] shall be a root of Jesse which shall
[52:11] stand for an ins sign of the people to
[52:12] it shall the Gentiles
[52:15] seek and his rest shall be glorious so
[52:18] now it's this is where it begins that's
[52:20] kind of a book in that creates a
[52:21] beautiful little framed picture for us
[52:23] to look at and there shall come forth a
[52:25] rock out of the stem of Jesse and a
[52:26] branch shall grow out of his
[52:29] roots
[52:31] to look at this fulfillment in d uh in
[52:34] Jesus
[52:36] Christ as the throne had been vacant for
[52:40] the the family of
[52:41] Jesse that there's a lot of truth that
[52:43] we could bring out in that season in
[52:44] that time but this is speaking of the
[52:46] Messiah King it's speaking of Jesus
[52:49] Christ The Royal authority of the House
[52:51] of David but the Bible doesn't say a out
[52:55] of the stem of
[52:57] David cuz David was a
[52:59] king uh David as a king as a prophet
[53:03] King as one that they all look to that
[53:05] that's high Authority and that would
[53:07] speak of royalty and that would speak of
[53:09] greatness that would speak of the throne
[53:10] out of the stem of David well that would
[53:12] be an heir of David would be the
[53:13] rightful Heir but notice the character
[53:16] of the Messiah is humble first humble
[53:19] and so it doesn't say from the House of
[53:21] David but from the the stem of Jesse to
[53:25] identify the humble character that the
[53:27] Messiah would come in not first
[53:30] identifying him with the throne but a
[53:32] stump yeah of the House of Jesse a
[53:35] branch shall grow out of his
[53:37] roots and the spirit of the Lord shall
[53:40] rest upon
[53:42] him and notice the TR pay attention to
[53:45] the true character of the influence of
[53:48] the spirit of the Lord if we say the
[53:50] spirit of the Lord is upon me I'm in the
[53:53] spirit of the Lord the spirit of the
[53:54] Lord is manifested himself where the
[53:56] spirit of the Lord is now think of that
[53:57] where the spirit of the Lord is and
[53:59] where we talk about the spirit of the
[53:59] Lord the spirit of the Lord the spirit
[54:00] the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
[54:02] him and now it's basically defin it the
[54:05] spirit of wisdom and understanding
[54:07] what's the spirit of the Lord the spirit
[54:08] of wisdom and understanding what is the
[54:10] spirit of the Lord the spirit of counsel
[54:12] and might what is the spirit of the Lord
[54:13] the spirit of knowledge and the fear of
[54:15] the Lord this is the spirit of the Lord
[54:18] this is where we would want it to
[54:20] manifest most
[54:21] supremely I I I've been studying on so
[54:24] many things maybe things certain things
[54:25] are spilling out but there's been a
[54:26] particular subject I've been studying on
[54:29] because there's ways that we can we want
[54:30] to be very very careful that when the
[54:33] spirit of the Lord moves and I'm going
[54:35] to say this definiely when the spirit of
[54:36] the Lord moves people can shout people
[54:39] can dance people will dance people will
[54:41] shout the spirit of the Lord caus people
[54:43] to speak in tongues real true genuine
[54:46] Spirit of the Lord be careful what you
[54:48] say about
[54:50] it because the when the spirit Lord and
[54:52] listen we're not talking Pentecost this
[54:55] this is what the spirit of God has done
[54:56] from the beginning the Holy Spirit
[54:58] caused miam to dance the Holy Spirit
[55:00] caused David to dance that has nothing
[55:02] to do with Pentecost has nothing to do
[55:03] with the day of Pentecost which was a
[55:05] new birth that's what the spirit of the
[55:06] Lord does so that's things that people
[55:08] can enjoy if they want
[55:10] to right but just because you see
[55:15] that isn't that a Vindication that
[55:17] someone's filled with the Holy Ghost nor
[55:20] does it always mean that it is the Holy
[55:22] Ghost because brother says I've seen
[55:24] naked heathen do the same thing
[55:27] amen I know I'm I'm making it maybe
[55:31] controversial making some people uneasy
[55:33] but I'm wanting to at least point you to
[55:35] to the real evidence of the spirit of
[55:36] the Lord the spirit of wisdom and
[55:39] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[55:40] might the spirit of knowledge and the
[55:41] fear of the
[55:42] Lord the Bible says in Zechariah not by
[55:45] might nor by
[55:46] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[55:50] of
[55:51] hosts what is the spirit of the lord
[55:53] it's the spirit of wisdom and
[55:55] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[55:57] might the spirit of knowledge and the
[56:00] fear of the Lord this is the spirit
[56:02] that's now resting upon the Messiah
[56:04] because we're looking at the whole Earth
[56:05] shall be full of the knowledge of the
[56:06] Lord how is the earth going to be full
[56:07] of the knowledge of the Lord it begins
[56:08] with Christ the Messiah the
[56:11] king and shall make him of quick
[56:14] understanding the fear of the Lord now
[56:16] we're looking at his
[56:20] character and he shall not judge after
[56:23] the sight of his eyes neither we prove
[56:25] after the hearing of his ears so it's
[56:27] not carnal understand it's not carnal
[56:29] wisdom it's the spirit of the Lord
[56:31] that's got
[56:32] discernment just as a man judges by the
[56:34] outward appearance but God weighs the
[56:37] heart but with righteousness shall he
[56:39] judge the poor and reprove with equity
[56:41] for the meek of the Earth for he shall
[56:43] Smite the Earth with the rod of his
[56:44] mouth and with the breath of his lips
[56:46] shall he slay the wicked what is this
[56:48] speaking of the word of God the word of
[56:49] God and righteousness shall be the
[56:51] girdle of his loins and faithfulness the
[56:53] girdle of his Reigns
[56:55] this is how the world is brought into
[56:57] this glorious condition this kind of
[57:00] authority this kind of King this kind of
[57:03] one that's ruling and reigning if I
[57:05] could even speculate this that had Adam
[57:07] not followed even the transgression that
[57:10] there could have been an Eden that
[57:13] persisted and so now as we come to this
[57:15] picture and it begins to describe an
[57:17] Eden condition there's one who cannot
[57:20] fall there's one who has the spirit of
[57:23] God who has the spirit of counsel and
[57:25] might who has the spirit of wisdom and
[57:28] understanding the spirit of knowledge of
[57:29] the fear of the Lord who has a quick
[57:31] understanding of the fear of the Lord
[57:32] who judges not after the eyesight in the
[57:34] Optics who reproves not after the
[57:36] sounding in his ears but with
[57:37] righteousness he
[57:40] judges in habac 2: 12 13 and 14 well to
[57:44] him that builth a town with blood and
[57:46] establishthedeen
[57:55] look at the condition look at the glory
[57:57] look at the Splendor look at the
[57:59] magnitude look at how beautiful it is
[58:02] and I says well to him that build a town
[58:03] with blood established a city by
[58:04] iniquity the New Jerusalem isn't
[58:06] established by iniquity sir that this
[58:09] town is not established by
[58:11] Blood behold it is not of the Lord of
[58:14] hosts that the people shall labor in the
[58:15] very fire and the people shall weary
[58:17] themselves for very vanity there's a lot
[58:19] being said there says for the Earth
[58:21] shall be filled with the knowledge of
[58:23] the glory of the Lord as the Waters
[58:25] cover the
[58:26] sea it's a knowledge of the glory of the
[58:28] Lord that's going to establish this
[58:30] Condition it's the knowledge of the
[58:32] glory of the Lord that builds the city
[58:33] it's the knowledge of the Lord Lord that
[58:35] builds the town not with the blood of
[58:38] man but has been established by that
[58:40] which the blood of God
[58:43] purchased and watch how the scripture
[58:46] unfolding through
[58:48] Isaiah we see these glimpses in these
[58:50] other chapters of the Bible verse 6 the
[58:52] wolf also shall dwell with the the lamb
[58:56] huh and the leopard shall lie down with
[58:59] the kid what and the calf of the Young
[59:02] Lion and the fatling together and a
[59:05] little child shall lead
[59:08] them a lion's going to eat hay with an
[59:12] ox a child's going to play at the
[59:15] opening of a deadly
[59:17] Viper we the fear is gone
[59:20] right there there's there's no there
[59:23] there all these things the images that
[59:25] begin to come out of these scriptures I
[59:26] want you to catch this and I'm just
[59:27] going to close with this kind of this
[59:29] pack this in here under the reign of the
[59:31] king of righteousness all Natures
[59:34] changed
[59:36] peace peace
[59:38] Reigns because of the spirit of wisdom
[59:40] and understanding the spirit of counsel
[59:41] and might the spirit of knowledge and
[59:42] the fear of the Lord that the the lion
[59:44] will lay down with the lamb we see that
[59:46] the the the leopard and the kid you
[59:50] anytime you see see a leopard uh with a
[59:53] kid he's up in a tree tree the goat
[59:56] right he's going to he's going to take
[59:58] that thing up into a tree he's going to
[59:59] eat that there there's but now you're
[1:00:02] talking about they're on the ground
[1:00:03] together hanging out if you can get this
[1:00:05] image in our minds I know that we think
[1:00:07] about these things we hear these things
[1:00:08] maybe we even sing about it it's poetry
[1:00:10] to us but this is the power of the
[1:00:11] spirit this is the real power of the
[1:00:14] spirit right here and when you begin to
[1:00:15] see Natures are changed and things are
[1:00:18] getting along that normally wouldn't and
[1:00:19] things that had been upset from the
[1:00:20] beginning now man is not afraid man is
[1:00:23] not the predator who's who's looking
[1:00:25] after prey the kid is not prey to the
[1:00:27] leopard the lion is eating is not eating
[1:00:29] meat it's eating straw think about this
[1:00:31] image Nature has completely changed
[1:00:34] Harmony's been brought back order has
[1:00:36] been brought back there's nothing Topsy
[1:00:37] Turvy nothing Ru you don't have a king
[1:00:39] of the jungle you have the king of the
[1:00:42] earth that now's reigning Supreme
[1:00:45] good it's the power of the spirit that's
[1:00:49] the power that brings the per
[1:00:51] Perfection that's why the Bible says
[1:00:52] they shall not hurt nor destroy in all
[1:00:56] my Holy Mountain why for the Earth shall
[1:00:59] be full of the knowledge of the Lord as
[1:01:01] the waters covers to
[1:01:03] see I hope this could I want you to see
[1:01:06] it I want you to see it with eyes of
[1:01:07] faith I want you to be able to picture
[1:01:08] this even in your mind's eye all
[1:01:10] wickedness and evil is held at
[1:01:13] Bay nowhere it's bound all that is
[1:01:17] displeasing remember hurt and destroy
[1:01:19] what we read in the beginning all that
[1:01:21] is displeasing all that is ous is put
[1:01:23] down
[1:01:25] all corruption all
[1:01:28] perversion every Power to spoil every
[1:01:31] corrupting influence is no longer
[1:01:34] working anything that spoils is no
[1:01:36] longer
[1:01:37] effective it's not that the Lion's going
[1:01:39] to have a
[1:01:41] muzzle it's not that the leopard's going
[1:01:43] to change his
[1:01:45] spots but something's
[1:01:48] changed all things
[1:01:50] Unholy all things
[1:01:52] unkind all things things
[1:01:55] unhappy stem from the lack of the
[1:01:58] knowledge of
[1:02:01] God all things impure all things Wicked
[1:02:05] all things Evil all come from a lack of
[1:02:07] God's knowledge it all comes from
[1:02:12] ignorance but here there'll be no unkind
[1:02:15] word no selfish deed no destruction of
[1:02:18] property no Wars no taking of
[1:02:21] life because the spirit of the Lord is
[1:02:26] gonna
[1:02:27] rest and he's gonna reign in the spirit
[1:02:30] of wisdom and understanding the spirit
[1:02:32] of counsel and might the spirit of
[1:02:33] knowledge and the fear of the
[1:02:35] Lord in this reign of righteousness and
[1:02:38] peace I don't know if you caught
[1:02:41] it but it's not describing Revelations
[1:02:44] 21 do you recognize this
[1:02:48] yet you mean I've been able to hide it
[1:02:50] to this point he not talking about the
[1:02:53] Eighth Day it's not talking about
[1:02:55] Revelations 21 it's not talking about
[1:02:57] the Earth after its last stage of
[1:02:58] redemption but it's talking about the
[1:03:01] Millennium in Revelations 20:6 blessed
[1:03:04] and holy is he that hath part of in this
[1:03:06] first resurrection on such the second
[1:03:08] death hath no power not forboding it's
[1:03:10] not dread but they shall be
[1:03:13] priests they shall be Priests of God and
[1:03:16] of Christ and shall reign with him a
[1:03:19] thousand years I just described you in
[1:03:21] the beginning of re Isaiah 11 the reign
[1:03:23] of the Messi
[1:03:24] now you're a priest with him now you're
[1:03:27] a king with him and you are going to
[1:03:29] Reign Hallelujah a thousand years and
[1:03:31] it's during this rain that we see the
[1:03:34] change of nature it's during this rain
[1:03:36] we see all things perverse all things
[1:03:38] unkind all things Unholy held it
[1:03:41] Bay there will be a kingdom of knowledge
[1:03:44] there will be a kingdom of glory and
[1:03:46] it's before the Earth's final stage of
[1:03:49] redemption I hope you're catching this
[1:03:52] before the Earth's final stage of
[1:03:54] redemption therefore I believe that as
[1:03:57] we can see that in type for the Earth
[1:03:58] that the believer now can be full of the
[1:04:01] knowledge of the Lord the believer now
[1:04:03] can be full of the glory of the Lord if
[1:04:05] God will bring the Earth to a millennial
[1:04:08] condition before that baptism of fire
[1:04:10] changes the Earth's body then God can do
[1:04:13] the same for us
[1:04:16] now that all things that hurt and
[1:04:19] Destroy can be subdued so that peace can
[1:04:23] rign
[1:04:24] for the Bible says in Proverbs chap
[1:04:28] 24:5 a wise man is strong yeah or yay a
[1:04:34] man of knowledge increaseth
[1:04:37] strength this is why I say knowledge is
[1:04:40] power this very verse right here A wise
[1:04:43] man is strong yay a man of knowledge
[1:04:45] increaseth strength I read it in I think
[1:04:47] 30 different
[1:04:50] translations you want me to read them
[1:04:52] all so I think someone said no so I
[1:04:54] won't I'll maybe read 18 how's that
[1:04:56] maybe
[1:04:58] 12 and all the translations it's
[1:05:00] rendered it basically the same a wise
[1:05:02] man is strong a wise man is strong wise
[1:05:03] man is strong wise man is strong a wise
[1:05:05] Warriors in strength Mighty is the wise
[1:05:07] of strength a wise man is strong a man
[1:05:09] of knowledge increases strength think of
[1:05:11] how I saying it a man of knowledge
[1:05:12] increases strength a man of knowledge
[1:05:14] increases might a man of man of
[1:05:16] knowledge makes strength greater a man
[1:05:19] of understanding increases strength the
[1:05:20] man of knowledge strengthens
[1:05:22] power revelation and knowledge increases
[1:05:25] strength in one translation wisdom
[1:05:27] brings strength and knowledge gives
[1:05:31] power the very atmology of the phrase
[1:05:33] knowledge is
[1:05:35] power and though they attribute it to
[1:05:37] different ones became quite common with
[1:05:40] Thomas Jefferson I think Francis Bacon
[1:05:42] may be one who quoted it but I think it
[1:05:43] was even someone that he learned from
[1:05:44] that originally maybe it
[1:05:46] begins but it comes back to the
[1:05:48] scripture right that when they try to
[1:05:51] track it down where would have they come
[1:05:52] up with this idea that knowledge is
[1:05:53] power all you got to do is go to
[1:05:55] Proverbs 24:5 a man of knowledge
[1:05:57] increases strength that knowledge gives
[1:06:00] power knowledge is
[1:06:02] empowering brother BR even says it this
[1:06:05] way we don't lack power we lack
[1:06:07] knowledge we lack Faith you got power
[1:06:09] but what's he saying you've got power
[1:06:10] but it lays dormant until there's
[1:06:11] knowledge there to use
[1:06:13] it so knowledge gives power its
[1:06:16] strength knowledge is empowering to
[1:06:19] power knowledge is power for your power
[1:06:21] however you want to look at it that you
[1:06:22] can sleep at night and be at peace what
[1:06:24] your pastor preached today whatever you
[1:06:26] need to do to make sense of it I don't
[1:06:28] mind just know that in knowing him
[1:06:30] there's power that knowledge is power
[1:06:33] that sometimes we can have uh we can
[1:06:35] have a lot of power by the baptism of
[1:06:37] the Holy Ghost we have power but we need
[1:06:39] Faith to use that power we need that
[1:06:41] knowledge to unlock that power not M
[1:06:44] mental knowledge not by might not by
[1:06:46] power in a carnal sense but by a Spirit
[1:06:49] by his Spirit sayith the
[1:06:51] Lord knowledge is empowering
[1:06:55] I I've been kind of sitting on this for
[1:06:57] a while now but a family testified a
[1:06:59] sister in the church testified to my
[1:07:01] wife just the mighty things that God was
[1:07:03] doing in their family and just how how
[1:07:06] amazing it was and and I got permission
[1:07:09] to use this I'm not I just it's it's
[1:07:11] been inspiring me ever since and and she
[1:07:14] testified about what God's doing in
[1:07:15] their family and made this comment if
[1:07:18] this is what God would do when we were
[1:07:21] clueless I think about that
[1:07:24] now let's get real think about what he
[1:07:26] did for us when we had no
[1:07:28] idea we we we didn't know it wasn't like
[1:07:30] well Lord really what I need for you to
[1:07:32] do if you'll just listen to me kind of
[1:07:33] what we do to our doctors sometime right
[1:07:35] we just tell him what treatment we need
[1:07:36] just write me a script doctor I think
[1:07:37] this is what it is and there's a
[1:07:40] paradigm that they follow and they do it
[1:07:41] for a good
[1:07:42] reason but we we we just want to go
[1:07:44] ahead and tell God what we need and
[1:07:45] we're completely clueless even at a
[1:07:48] point to where we didn't even really
[1:07:49] think L we could think about when we
[1:07:51] were saved we didn't really know how
[1:07:53] much we needed God right it wasn't like
[1:07:55] we could go to God and quantify and say
[1:07:57] well I need you because this is what's
[1:07:58] going to happen that's going to happen
[1:07:59] God's like oh my goodness I had no idea
[1:08:01] I better save you real
[1:08:02] quick but if God would do it she says
[1:08:05] when we were clueless of how much we
[1:08:07] needed
[1:08:08] him and this is a part that inspired me
[1:08:10] there was this recognition that God does
[1:08:13] things when we're
[1:08:15] ignorant God does things for us when
[1:08:17] we're cluess when we did not know him
[1:08:20] when we were aranged from him when we
[1:08:23] didn't know his he yet loved us still
[1:08:25] when we ran from he chased us when he
[1:08:28] did it when we were closed she said how
[1:08:30] much more will he do when our hearts are
[1:08:32] hungering and thirsting for the
[1:08:34] righteous fruit of his word in our
[1:08:36] hearts and
[1:08:38] lives think of that if he did that for
[1:08:40] you when you were cless how much more
[1:08:43] can he do for you when you're seeking it
[1:08:46] if he does it for you and you didn't
[1:08:47] know how much more when you do know how
[1:08:51] much more when you're
[1:08:52] hungry
[1:08:55] Hallelujah musicians if you'd
[1:08:58] come the Bible says in Colossians 3:15
[1:09:01] and let the peace of God rule in your
[1:09:06] hearts the Bible says that that Christ
[1:09:09] May dwell in your hearts by faith says
[1:09:11] for he must
[1:09:12] Reign there's the
[1:09:15] throne it's in
[1:09:18] you and maybe I'll take some more time
[1:09:20] on this subject I I feel I'm very near
[1:09:22] maybe in my heart in terms of where the
[1:09:24] series is going but if one day the Earth
[1:09:28] Revelations 21 after its baptism of
[1:09:30] fire is going to be in a glorious
[1:09:32] condition never will be death sin
[1:09:34] nothing think of all those scriptures
[1:09:36] nothing to defile no lying cheating
[1:09:38] stealing nothing no up and down no in
[1:09:40] and out Perfection forever the perfect
[1:09:44] Kingdom it's ushered in permanently
[1:09:46] forever that's going to happen after the
[1:09:48] Earth receives its baptism of the Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost then what about
[1:09:52] you what about you before your body's
[1:09:58] changed the Earth's going to have its
[1:09:59] Millennium before its body's changed
[1:10:01] what about you yeah what about I'm
[1:10:05] talking about I'm not talking about the
[1:10:06] Earth but I'm talking about
[1:10:07] you about in your heart right now with
[1:10:09] the king of righteousness ruling and
[1:10:10] reigning in your hearts can not the
[1:10:13] peace of God
[1:10:15] rule is not the spirit of God able to
[1:10:18] put down everything that's unkind Unholy
[1:10:22] unruly disciplined is it able oh brother
[1:10:26] Aaron you're making me nervous cuz I'm
[1:10:28] going to have to live a perfect life and
[1:10:30] if I ever make a aake no uh that's not
[1:10:32] it at all I mean even after the
[1:10:34] Millennium you got to deal with sin you
[1:10:36] got to deal with
[1:10:37] death you got to button it all up you
[1:10:39] got to take care of it but we're just
[1:10:40] talking about an acknowledgement right
[1:10:42] now that the power of God that's on the
[1:10:43] inside of you right now is able to
[1:10:46] subdue every fear every doubt every sin
[1:10:51] every weakness and to have the kind of
[1:10:53] confidence to know that to the extent
[1:10:56] that sickness is not put down God must
[1:10:58] have a reason for it am to the extent
[1:11:01] that this something's taking place and
[1:11:03] things aren't changing I seek and pursue
[1:11:04] to humble myself to make sure that I'm
[1:11:06] in the right place with God I'm checking
[1:11:08] his word I'm I'm living the life I'm I'm
[1:11:10] doing everything I know is right I just
[1:11:12] trust him all the more that he's going
[1:11:13] to turn this all out right and how do we
[1:11:15] know cuz look what the Millennium is
[1:11:17] going to be after all the nonsense 6,000
[1:11:18] years before look what eternity is going
[1:11:21] to be after everything that took place
[1:11:23] before
[1:11:24] God is able amen and if God will do the
[1:11:28] things he's done for us when we didn't
[1:11:30] know when we didn't know what to ask
[1:11:32] when we didn't know what to think when
[1:11:33] we didn't know what he would do we
[1:11:35] didn't know what the word said but how
[1:11:37] much more can he when we
[1:11:41] know I pray that you'd be filled with
[1:11:43] the knowledge of his will and all wisdom
[1:11:45] and spiritual understanding you find
[1:11:47] that the very language that Paul is
[1:11:48] using in the scripture is essentially
[1:11:51] taking the very description of the
[1:11:53] Messiah
[1:11:54] where in the spirit of God will rest
[1:11:56] upon him in the spirit of wisdom and
[1:11:57] understand the spirit of counsel and
[1:11:58] might and the spirit of knowledge and
[1:11:59] the fear of the Lord that Paul is
[1:12:00] basically preaching that same message
[1:12:02] over the elect and brother Brandon
[1:12:04] preached the same message over the elect
[1:12:06] to dress her in that to clothe Us in
[1:12:11] that and the he says that you might walk
[1:12:14] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing
[1:12:18] being fruitful in every good
[1:12:20] work The Perils of ignorance is sin
[1:12:24] distrust disloyalty failure wickedness
[1:12:28] but the power of knowledge is
[1:12:31] righteousness and the knowledge of the
[1:12:33] Holy that that's understanding to depart
[1:12:35] from Evil that's
[1:12:37] understanding I pray that the Lord will
[1:12:39] give you strength
[1:12:41] today we can be honest with ourselves
[1:12:43] honest with each other there's times we
[1:12:45] have settings where we can Fellowship
[1:12:47] we're honest with one another it's easy
[1:12:50] when I'm the only one facing you and
[1:12:53] you're you're just looking at me and
[1:12:54] we're not really conscious about
[1:12:55] everything that's going in the room we
[1:12:57] can think about things in a very
[1:12:59] isolated uh insulated way and maybe it
[1:13:01] discourages you a little bit maybe it
[1:13:03] scares you a little bit but we could all
[1:13:04] be honest with ourselves these are
[1:13:06] difficult
[1:13:07] times these are Troublesome times
[1:13:09] there's a lot of stuff that's going on
[1:13:10] in the world a lot of stuff going on
[1:13:11] socially a lot of stuff going on even in
[1:13:13] the message that's just trying to Rattle
[1:13:14] to shake and to unnerve people but
[1:13:16] listen he's here he's got it all in
[1:13:19] control and when the Bible says let the
[1:13:21] peace of God rule in your hearts it
[1:13:23] means let him
[1:13:24] control let the peace of God
[1:13:28] control let him who is the king of
[1:13:31] righteousness just let him Reign amen
[1:13:34] I'm not I'm not praying it for a
[1:13:36] millennium it'll come God prophesied it
[1:13:40] I'm not praying it for the eighth day
[1:13:41] it's going to come nothing's going to
[1:13:43] stop it but I can be in the way right
[1:13:46] now of a millennial peace rising up
[1:13:50] brother Bram begins to preach a day new
[1:13:51] day is Dawning a new day is Dawning I
[1:13:53] can feel it bubbling over I feel it
[1:13:54] pouring over me right now in your hearts
[1:13:56] just purpose in your heart I'm going to
[1:13:57] let you rain Lord I want you to rain
[1:13:59] Supreme I want you to have preeminence
[1:14:01] and let the peace of God control you
[1:14:03] from the control tower stand with me
[1:14:05] today
