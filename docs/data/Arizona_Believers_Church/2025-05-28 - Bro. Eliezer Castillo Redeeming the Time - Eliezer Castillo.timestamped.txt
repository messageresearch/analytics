[0:00] Amen. Amen. If you would like to turn
[0:02] with me to Ephesians
[0:06] 5
[0:10] 14, it's always good um you know on the
[0:14] middle of the week just to come to
[0:16] church and just kind of break the
[0:17] monotony of life and and just have a
[0:20] good time in the Lord.
[0:24] Ephesians
[0:30] 5:14-16 the Bible says wherefore he
[0:33] saith awake thou that sleepest and
[0:36] arrive arise from the dead and Christ
[0:38] shall give thee light see that ye walk
[0:42] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[0:46] redeeming the time because the days are
[0:50] evil. Let us just pray once more.
[0:53] Heavenly Father, Lord, we have read your
[0:55] scripture, Father, and we're going to
[0:57] allow your Holy Spirit just to come and
[0:59] take control, Father. We just ask that
[1:01] every need, Lord, that is met tonight,
[1:04] Father. Everything that we need, Father,
[1:06] Lord, that you may just give to us,
[1:08] Father, we completely give the service
[1:11] unto you. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13] Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. Amen.
[1:16] You may be seated. If you would like to
[1:18] turn with me to
[1:20] Ecclesiastics 3 1-11. This is a thought
[1:24] that um you know frankly I I just can't
[1:27] uh get away from. You know uh I think
[1:30] just as Christians we study things and
[1:32] we go back and forth on things and this
[1:35] is one thing that uh I just I I I love
[1:38] to continue to uh to just revisit. So,
[1:41] it's it's something that I've already
[1:43] had the thought and I I've studied it
[1:45] and I just um feel like it it's needful
[1:49] for today. So, Ecclesiastics 3:es 1-1 it
[1:55] says, "And to everything there is a
[1:57] season. Every time there is a purpose
[2:00] under heaven." So, that that's already a
[2:03] mouthful right there. There to
[2:07] everything. So, everything is a thing,
[2:09] right? We are people but we see things
[2:12] everything there is a season appointed
[2:15] to it right and a time to every purpose
[2:18] under heaven. So every purpose
[2:22] everything that is here there is a time
[2:26] almost attached to it. A time to be born
[2:29] a time to die. A time to plant. A time
[2:32] to to pluck that which has been planted.
[2:35] A time to kill. A time to heal. A time
[2:37] to break down. A time to build up, a
[2:40] time to weep, a time to laugh, a time to
[2:42] mourn, a time to dance, a time to cast
[2:45] away stones, a time to gather stones
[2:48] together, a time to embrace, and a time
[2:50] to refrain from embracing. A time to get
[2:53] and a time to lose. A time to keep and a
[2:56] time to cast away. A time to rend and a
[2:59] time to sow. A time to keep silence and
[3:01] a time to speak. A time to love and a
[3:03] time to hate. A time of war and a time
[3:06] of peace. And he asked this question. He
[3:08] says, "What profitth um he that workketh
[3:12] in that whereth he
[3:14] labor?" And and in verse 10, he says,
[3:17] "I've seen the travail that God hath
[3:20] given the sons of men to be exercised in
[3:22] it." In verse 11,
[3:26] he everything beautiful in his time.
[3:31] So even though this is a travail or a
[3:33] burden that he's given to man,
[3:36] everything under time is made beautiful
[3:40] within time. He says everything is made
[3:43] beautiful in time. And he says, "And
[3:47] also he has set the world in their heart
[3:50] so that no man can find out the work
[3:53] that God maketh from the beginning to
[3:55] the end."
[3:56] Now um if you look at other versions in
[3:59] Ecclesiastics uh 3:11, he says instead
[4:03] of he set the world in somebody's heart,
[4:05] it says he set eternity in their heart.
[4:09] That's the actual the Hebrew word that
[4:11] he set eternity. So um even though we
[4:15] are bound by this boundary of time, even
[4:18] though that we have this and everything
[4:20] is subject to time that there's people
[4:24] that he set eternity inside of. So So
[4:28] we're going to go through life, we're
[4:29] going to go through things, but and
[4:32] we're going to go through the es and
[4:34] flows of life, yet we have eternity in
[4:36] us. So there's these two opposing
[4:38] truths. one hand there's all things are
[4:40] all short-lived passing moments they
[4:42] come and go with natural flows of life
[4:45] they're temporary but beautiful in his
[4:47] time as as uh the the proverb says on
[4:51] the other hand there's this contrasting
[4:53] part that the person as he goes through
[4:56] this constantly moving life that he's
[5:00] holding something that doesn't decay
[5:03] he's holding something that's not going
[5:05] to fade away even though brothers and
[5:08] sisters is we're going to grow old and
[5:10] one day we're going to die. That
[5:12] eternity is going to take us to the
[5:14] place that we've always been desiring
[5:16] for. So in reality, we're not meant or
[5:20] we're not meant to be in this boundary.
[5:23] You're meant to live in another world
[5:26] altogether. And we're what we're what's
[5:28] happening when you you're born and you
[5:30] grow up. We're working our way back to
[5:33] eternity. We're way working our way back
[5:36] to whatever has been planted just like
[5:39] um Jesus says I I go from the father and
[5:42] I go back to the father and u that's
[5:46] that's um the purpose of our lives. Now
[5:50] now brother Brandham he says that this
[5:52] thing called time and I said a little
[5:54] bit on on Sunday that this thing is a
[5:58] dimension. Brother Brandham, he's he
[6:00] said that and maybe people thought he
[6:02] was crazy when he started calling a time
[6:04] a dimension. But then you have this man
[6:07] um Albert Einstein that had this theory
[6:09] of special or this theory of special
[6:12] relativity relativity that he said that
[6:15] that time can
[6:18] change. Time can be measurable. that
[6:22] that depending on how fast you go, the
[6:24] faster you go and the speed of light,
[6:27] the slower time goes. So, so you can
[6:31] have a clock that is moving and then one
[6:33] that is staying still. The one that is
[6:35] moving is going to actually go slower
[6:38] even though they're the same time. It's
[6:41] not that somebody changes the time or or
[6:43] or the clock's messed up, but something
[6:46] happens where time the dimension
[6:49] actually changes. So time it can be
[6:53] manipulated and it could be measured.
[6:55] It's showing that th this is a physical
[6:58] thing and this is a
[7:00] dimension. So whenever we look at our
[7:03] clocks our our clock and our watch it's
[7:06] this is not our time. This is just
[7:09] measures the time. We could take off our
[7:11] our clocks or our watches. We could put
[7:14] them away. We're still subject to time.
[7:16] We don't have to live off of the 24
[7:18] hours a day and all these things that
[7:20] the people have made. We're still
[7:22] subject under time because time isn't
[7:24] something that man-made. It's actually
[7:27] something that God constructed around
[7:29] us. It's a dimension God gave us. So it
[7:33] it's something that that is needed and
[7:36] it's something that God put in place.
[7:39] Brother Brandham, he says um in Saint
[7:42] Satan's Eden, he says, "Now it took God
[7:45] 6,000 years." And now this is just puts
[7:47] us to perspective. We all know this, but
[7:49] um just so that we can kind of open up
[7:52] our minds, but he says it took God 6,000
[7:55] years. It didn't take him that long, but
[7:57] he took that long, 6,000 years. Because
[8:00] we're taught that one day in heaven is a
[8:04] thousand years on earth. Now the Bible
[8:07] in second Peter it says that one day
[8:09] with the Lord but brother Brandham says
[8:11] this day with the Lord is the day in
[8:13] heaven right so there's a day in heaven
[8:17] which is a thousand years on earth he
[8:20] says one day in heaven is a thousand
[8:22] years on earth and 6,000 years or six
[8:25] days God built the earth and and and and
[8:30] remember whenever he told Adam and Eve
[8:32] he said this the day you eat thereof is
[8:35] the day you die when he told and he
[8:38] warned Adam and Eve hey don't eat from
[8:40] this fruit because the day you eat
[8:42] thereof is the day you die now my
[8:44] question is did they die that
[8:47] day well they didn't die the day know
[8:50] but they died within the a thousand
[8:53] years right so the day that God was
[8:56] saying he he had a different perspective
[8:58] and he said the day you eat thereof is
[9:00] the day you die Adam only livedund 930
[9:04] years. So he died within that
[9:08] day. So we can see that we are in these
[9:12] de these dimensions and these dimensions
[9:15] are in a boundary or this dimension of
[9:18] time that the prophet he told he
[9:20] revealed to us and now science is barely
[9:23] catching up and saying oh this is a
[9:24] fourth
[9:26] dimension. So so he he lived 900 years
[9:30] after he sinned. So he died after that.
[9:32] And of course we could also see it the
[9:35] other way that he died that day because
[9:37] death is separation. So he says the day
[9:41] you eat thereof is the day you die.
[9:44] That's the day they separated eternally
[9:46] from God. So you could see it in these
[9:49] two two aspects. Now now in um Christ it
[9:53] uh is revealed in his own word. Brother
[9:55] Brandham says, "Now they're going to
[9:57] find out someday that we're not seeing
[10:01] 150 million years of light space e
[10:03] either." Now, now mind you, this is a
[10:05] seventh grade education right here
[10:08] that's speaking to us. This is not this
[10:11] scientist, this great scientist. This is
[10:13] a seventh grade education that science
[10:16] is confirming,
[10:18] right? He says, uh, they're going, um,
[10:22] they're going right around in a circle.
[10:24] That's exactly. You're going to find out
[10:26] one of these days that when you go to
[10:28] heaven that you don't fly off somewhere
[10:31] else. You're still here. You're still
[10:34] here, too. Just in another dimension
[10:37] that is faster than this. So, we're not
[10:40] going out. Whenever they they say
[10:42] they're going to build a tower to
[10:43] heaven, we think about height. Well,
[10:46] these people were smarter than us. So,
[10:49] so they weren't trying to because they
[10:51] already knew. They shot um devices all
[10:53] the way to the moon, brother Brandham
[10:55] says. So they knew if they built a tower
[10:58] all the way up by by height that they
[11:01] would just get into space. So So they
[11:04] had another idea of how they're going to
[11:07] go into heaven. Now here, brother
[11:10] Brandham's showing that heaven's not way
[11:12] out there. that we're not building
[11:15] another tower, but he says heaven is
[11:18] right here, just right above us. He says
[11:22] it's just in a faster dimension. And if
[11:25] if we know the theory of special
[11:27] relativity, it's the faster you go,
[11:30] slower time goes. So this dimension is
[11:33] so fast that one day in this dimension
[11:37] is a thousand years here. That's how
[11:40] fast this dimension is. Now, now you
[11:42] have to think about it because it's been
[11:44] 2,000 years since Christ died on the
[11:47] cross. Ever since then, there's been
[11:50] many people that have been called in the
[11:52] bride and went into this dimension or
[11:55] this heaven that is faster than this.
[11:59] Now, think about it. They they gone into
[12:01] the sixth dimension. It's t taken 2,000
[12:04] years. How long in
[12:06] heaven? It's only been two days. If you
[12:10] just think about it by the way the
[12:11] message in the Bible's talking about it,
[12:13] it's only been two days in heaven.
[12:16] You know, my my dad, I've said this
[12:18] before, but my dad, he's he's uh when my
[12:22] my grandma passed away, he he longed to
[12:24] see my my grandma, his mother, and it
[12:28] was over 20 years since she passed away,
[12:31] it was a almost a whole lifetime, a
[12:34] quarter of a lifetime if you want to
[12:35] count a century of of of just waiting to
[12:39] get back to his mama.
[12:42] And then whenever my dad finally passed
[12:44] away, he went up there and he almost
[12:47] went there the same exact time. If you
[12:50] think about it, 20 years is just a
[12:53] second or two. So when he went up there,
[12:56] it's like they've never even separated
[12:58] in the first
[13:00] place. So So time, it's God God is
[13:04] maneuvering time for
[13:06] himself and there's a purpose within
[13:09] time. Now, God
[13:11] himself, just like I was talking about
[13:13] on Sunday, how eternity isn't a lot of
[13:16] time. God isn't a person with a lot of
[13:19] time. He's not a person that has just a
[13:22] lot and lot of time. In Isaiah 57:15, it
[13:25] says, "For thus saith the high and lofty
[13:28] one inhabitth
[13:30] eternity." So he's altogether
[13:34] outside of time who inhabits eternity
[13:37] whose name is holy and dwell in the high
[13:40] and holy place with him also that is of
[13:43] the contrite and humble spirit to revive
[13:45] the spirit of the humble and revive the
[13:47] heart of the contrite ones. So it's the
[13:51] one who inhabits eternity. Now he
[13:55] doesn't only if you like if I would like
[13:57] to say this he doesn't only inhabit it
[14:00] but he is eternity.
[14:02] There is nothing eternal we we know this
[14:05] by the message and the Bible that there
[14:07] is nothing eternal but God there's
[14:09] nothing outside of God that is eternal.
[14:13] So, so we we are in this bubble or this
[14:16] little thing, this little speck of time,
[14:19] this little timeline, however you want
[14:21] to call it, of time. And then God
[14:25] encapsulates it all. We we hear we see
[14:28] that like in when Adam speaks Christ is
[14:31] the mystery of God revealed. He says
[14:32] after you go uh millions and millions
[14:35] and trillions and trillions of light
[14:36] space, he says he engulfves all space,
[14:38] time, and eternity. So it's just this
[14:41] God that that is we can't even measure
[14:46] because he's unmeasurable because
[14:48] measure is a dimension, right? Length,
[14:50] width, and height. So can't even measure
[14:52] him. He's
[14:54] unmeasurable. So he's outside of that.
[14:57] So So this earth, if we think about it,
[14:59] this life on earth is the only place
[15:02] where created beings live outside of the
[15:05] full direct experience of God's
[15:07] eternity. This is the only place outside
[15:11] of time, outside of these dimensions of
[15:13] length, width, and height and time and a
[15:16] and and light and matter and all of
[15:18] that. You have
[15:20] eternity. You have an all watching uh
[15:24] eye watching over us, knowing every
[15:28] single thing about us. Every second,
[15:31] every minute, every hour of our life,
[15:34] there is a God watching over us. And
[15:36] he's not overwhelmed in our lives. He's
[15:38] not overwhelmed by the world. He can see
[15:41] it in plain
[15:43] view. Okay? And and words can't even
[15:45] describe what what is what this is,
[15:49] right? But here in this little bubble of
[15:53] time, this is where people can
[15:55] experience life without God.
[15:59] They they're they're God is allowing
[16:02] people by free will by free will of
[16:04] choice to accept or deny
[16:07] God. And and now we have this unique
[16:10] chance to make choices and grow and and
[16:14] um and fail and get back up and do all
[16:18] these things. Why? Because we are in
[16:20] this little bubble of
[16:22] time. We're able to do that. and and now
[16:25] we are just set in between the eternity
[16:28] that we came from going back to eternity
[16:31] that we came from. We're in this little
[16:34] time. So this is an important time that
[16:36] we're living in. So um there is nothing
[16:41] eternal besides God. So if you want to
[16:43] think about outside of time, it's just
[16:47] God, right? And and we can't even think
[16:49] of him as uh the greatness of God. It's
[16:52] just it's incomprehensible. Right? So
[16:56] here in Genesis 1:14, it says that here
[17:00] this is where God began to set the time
[17:02] and the boundaries. He said, "And God
[17:04] said, let there be lights in the
[17:06] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[17:09] day from the night, and let there be um
[17:11] them for signs, for seasons, and for
[17:13] days, and for years." So he he created
[17:17] the sun, the moon, the planets along
[17:19] with their rotations and the orbits to
[17:21] help the measure of time. And and that's
[17:24] another um that's the theory of
[17:27] relativity relativity where the the the
[17:31] planets they begin to bend space and
[17:34] time and all of that and cause things to
[17:37] move. And God did all that and all we're
[17:40] doing is just trying to figure it out or
[17:42] the human races. But God set all those
[17:45] time all all those things and God set
[17:48] his people Adam and Eve in
[17:51] these life and he set them as eternal
[17:56] beings. Yet time was running. He these
[18:00] were eternal beings living within all
[18:04] this everything in harmony. But when
[18:06] Adam and Eve
[18:07] sinned something happened where they
[18:10] became subject under time.
[18:14] Brother Brandham said, um, an a tree
[18:18] never died before Adam. An animal
[18:21] wouldn't die before Adam. Now, I don't
[18:24] think I I have this one for you guys,
[18:26] but he said,
[18:27] uh, before Adam, there was only one
[18:30] thing that cannot die, and that is God,
[18:32] because he is eternal. That's the only
[18:35] way we can ever keep from dying. We have
[18:38] eternal life in us, to be sons and
[18:41] daughters of God.
[18:43] So, so nothing died until they sinned.
[18:46] Then everything went under time and a
[18:50] timer started for everything. The Bible
[18:52] says that there is a time for
[18:55] everything, a season for
[18:57] everything. So you look at this pulpit,
[19:00] this building, the trees, us, we all
[19:03] have timers right above
[19:06] us. Every single thing has a time. Every
[19:10] single thing has a season. Brother
[19:13] Brandham, he says that day on Calvary,
[19:15] he says, "There's something wrong. He's
[19:17] getting old. He's dying. He's withering
[19:20] away. Sickness is on him. He's in
[19:22] bondage. Trees grow, but they're not
[19:24] immortal but not immortal. They die. The
[19:27] mountains change. The seas dry up. The
[19:30] waters fail."
[19:31] So that's that's a hard reality that we
[19:34] face today that that when sin entered
[19:37] earth, brother Brandham says it infected
[19:41] everything. Sin and all of its
[19:43] infection, all all of the infection that
[19:45] was caused by sin was thrown under time.
[19:48] And that's including us. And and I
[19:50] believe that's why you have like in
[19:52] Hebrews 11 um verses 113 and 16 and all
[19:56] of those where it shows the faithful
[19:59] acknowledging this that they were
[20:02] strangers and
[20:03] pilgrims looking for a city that was not
[20:06] going to
[20:07] perish because because they knew they
[20:10] they came in contact with the originator
[20:12] with the eternal life and they they
[20:15] begin to look for something that was
[20:17] eternal because they knew everything
[20:18] else was going to
[20:20] perish. So we go back to Ecclesiastics
[20:23] 3:1. It says, "Everything there is a
[20:25] season and and time to every purpose
[20:29] under heaven." So to every there is a
[20:32] time limit or or a time framed attached
[20:35] to it. Everything has to ha have
[20:39] everything that has time attached to it
[20:41] means that it's got to perish. Just like
[20:44] he said, "The day you eat thereof is the
[20:46] day you die." He put a time stamp there
[20:50] and he said one day he's going to
[20:52] perish. So everything that's got time
[20:55] above it, we're subject to time. That
[20:58] means there's a perishing there there's
[21:00] a time to
[21:01] perish. We cannot
[21:03] last. That's when we're subject under
[21:06] time. That's what
[21:08] happens. That everything under time it
[21:11] has to die.
[21:14] So, you know, um the good job that we
[21:17] have, the family we have, the good
[21:19] health, every single thing you you see
[21:22] all the good times, you know, whenever
[21:23] you have just having a good time, it's
[21:26] not going to last because everything has
[21:28] a season. So, there's a season for every
[21:32] single thing. And that makes me happy.
[21:36] The Bible says everything is made
[21:38] beautiful in its time. That means when
[21:41] we're going through a trial, we're going
[21:44] through a season of hard time, brother,
[21:47] sister, it seems like it's never going
[21:49] to end. It seems like that we just can't
[21:52] see the light in the end of the tunnel.
[21:55] And and and you know what? We see people
[21:58] taking their lives away because of that.
[22:01] We see people going into drugs. We see
[22:04] people going into horrible situations
[22:06] because they feel like it's not going to
[22:08] end.
[22:10] But the promise is that everything has a
[22:13] season.
[22:15] Meaning it has to change.
[22:18] That's that's what I love about uh
[22:21] Phoenix because this hot weather, it has
[22:24] to change back to good weather.
[22:27] Sometimes when you're in the middle of
[22:28] August, you're just like, "This is never
[22:30] going to end." But it's going to. Why?
[22:33] Because it's in seasons. There's seasons
[22:35] and it's got to
[22:37] end. And and so so time what it does, it
[22:42] allows the process and development in
[22:45] our lives. That's what time does. See,
[22:49] see now we're not perfect beings like
[22:52] Adam and Eve. We're not these people
[22:54] that were just came out and we were
[22:56] perfect. Now we have time to grow and to
[23:01] mature, to sometimes mess up, get back
[23:05] up, get closer to the Lord, and and and
[23:07] and fix the time that we have. Without
[23:11] time, there's no space for growth,
[23:14] repentance,
[23:15] transformation. Time gives us
[23:18] mercy, and gives us second chances.
[23:20] Isn't that amazing? That's what time
[23:24] does, God. and and and so every decision
[23:28] we make, we we mess up. We're not going
[23:30] to make good decisions sometimes. We
[23:32] have chances to to fix those things.
[23:35] God, the difference between us and God
[23:36] is God is
[23:38] eternal. So every decision he makes,
[23:41] it's got to be that way. Everything God
[23:44] says has got to be that way. Every move
[23:48] he makes, it's going to last from
[23:50] eternity all the way to
[23:51] eternity. That's why we can believe his
[23:55] word.
[23:56] cuz he's not over here with a eraser and
[23:58] saying, "You know what? Hold on. I
[24:00] messed up there. Oh, I messed up here."
[24:02] No, he's an eternal being that is not
[24:04] subject to. So, every move he makes is
[24:07] echoed from eternity to eternity to
[24:10] eternity.
[24:12] That's why we are temporal. And you know
[24:14] what? We got to thank God to for being
[24:17] temporal.
[24:19] Because we are not in the condition
[24:20] we're supposed
[24:22] we're not so so every decision we make
[24:25] imagine if we made a decision in our
[24:27] lives the way we are
[24:30] eternally an eternal decision in
[24:34] eternity then it can never it can never
[24:36] be
[24:37] changed but since we're in this
[24:40] thing every decision you make you can
[24:43] say you know what I messed up there you
[24:45] know what I I I've over I overcorrected
[24:48] did. I I didn't do much here. I didn't
[24:50] do this. And and you can go back and you
[24:52] say, "Lord, forgive me. Forgive me for
[24:55] what I've done." And because of time,
[24:58] God can change those
[25:01] things. God can can change every single
[25:05] thing. So imagine sinning in an eternal
[25:07] state. And and that thought comes to
[25:09] where was Satan when he sinned, right?
[25:12] So thank God that our past is our past
[25:14] and and we're not defined by our past.
[25:17] And if you sin now, you don't have to
[25:19] stay there. You can change your future
[25:22] by surrendering your your life to Jesus
[25:24] in the present. That's the amazing
[25:28] thing. So, so time it's not a
[25:31] mistake. It's not a a judgment. It's a
[25:35] divine part of God's plan for our
[25:37] salvation. Though it brings sorrow,
[25:40] aging, death, it also brings growth,
[25:43] opportunity, and chance to overcome.
[25:47] And one day those that have been
[25:49] faithful will step back into God's
[25:53] presence. God will one day will go back
[25:57] to to
[25:58] eternity. Mark uh
[26:01] 13:32 here it
[26:04] says says but if that day that hour no
[26:08] man know no um knoweth no man know not
[26:11] the angels which are which are in heaven
[26:14] neither the son but the father take ye
[26:17] heed watch and pray for ye know not when
[26:21] the time is.
[26:23] So there's there's a set time but we
[26:25] don't know what it is. and he says,
[26:28] "Watch and pray." You you know what I I
[26:31] I like is what rings loud in the Bible
[26:36] is this sense of urgency of it could
[26:40] happen at any moment now. That there's
[26:43] there's the time is at hand. You know,
[26:47] even Jesus preached that. Jesus is
[26:50] saying that. He says just watch, pray,
[26:52] be ready. It's it's going to come when
[26:54] you don't expect it. Go. Jesus preached
[26:58] that. Paul came came on the scene and he
[27:02] preached the same
[27:03] gospel. He even included himself. He
[27:06] says, "Those that are dead, we that are
[27:09] alive will meet them in the will meet
[27:11] them and then we'll go up in the air."
[27:14] It's not that he thought he was going to
[27:16] go in the rapture. He knew the word. He
[27:19] knew what needed to take place, but he
[27:21] put himself there to put a sense of
[27:24] urgency in these people.
[27:26] so that it could happen any time. The
[27:28] rapture could happen. We could be there.
[27:32] So there's this sense of urgency
[27:34] throughout the whole seven church ages
[27:37] even though the time is now.
[27:41] Now is the time. And and you know what's
[27:44] the amazing thing is is I I've had great
[27:46] great people, great mentors that that
[27:49] have passed on that that's what they
[27:51] were preaching and now they're out with
[27:54] the Lord.
[27:56] So, so when the time is now, we have to
[27:59] understand that we're waiting for things
[28:01] and that's good. We got to look for
[28:04] signs, but don't let those things alarm
[28:06] you because like I've said before, the
[28:08] 101 can take us before the
[28:11] rapture. The I17 will take you way
[28:14] quicker. I'll tell you that real quick
[28:16] with all these
[28:17] drivers. So, so while we're looking at
[28:20] all these times and say, "Well, we don't
[28:22] know, but this has to happen first. This
[28:24] has to happen." But you can trip and
[28:25] fall and meet the Lord there.
[28:28] Right? So the time is at hand.
[28:31] What how much time do we have? Sometimes
[28:35] we're looking way out there when God
[28:38] already knows the number of years and
[28:40] days and minutes that we have in our
[28:42] lives.
[28:46] So here in uh Job he says that his in
[28:51] Job 14:5 he says seeing his days are
[28:54] determined. Now this is them talking
[28:57] about how God sets these boundaries. He
[29:00] says his days are determined the number
[29:02] of the months are with thee and thou has
[29:05] appointed his bounds and he cannot pass.
[29:09] That's that is heavy for us because now
[29:13] you you you want all these um neural
[29:15] links. You you want to download people
[29:18] want to download their conscience on on
[29:20] other things and they want to live
[29:21] forever. Other people are are doing
[29:23] everything they can. All these uh health
[29:26] gurus trying to live as much as they
[29:28] can want to live eternally but the Bible
[29:33] says is God has already determined their
[29:35] days.
[29:37] So it doesn't matter how much I was
[29:39] talking to my wife about it. It's like
[29:41] doesn't matter how much we're healthy.
[29:43] Yeah. But you still want to live a good
[29:45] life. You don't want to be just eating
[29:47] whatever you want to eat. I'm like oh
[29:49] that's true too. But but it doesn't
[29:53] matter what we do how much we try to
[29:56] prolong our life. God has already preset
[29:59] our
[30:00] time. Our lifespan is fixed. God knows
[30:05] the set number of our
[30:07] days. We do not live randomly or by
[30:12] chance. Man, that's you know that's when
[30:15] we need to start thinking about our
[30:17] purpose. Start thinking about why are we
[30:20] here? If if God already placed the time,
[30:24] okay, Lord, why am I here? Why what am I
[30:26] supposed to be
[30:29] doing? So he's sovereign. So he
[30:32] determines the length of each person's
[30:36] life. It's not only that that he he sets
[30:39] it, but it's it's not even hidden to
[30:41] him. He knows
[30:43] everything. So like I said, we all have
[30:45] a set number over us
[30:47] today. We the uh you know the I think
[30:52] it's 90 right now. People's um lifespan
[30:55] is around 90. But we don't know. We
[30:58] don't know if we're going to live that
[30:59] long. You know, I'm 34 years old. I can,
[31:02] you know, I can be forever 34. I can die
[31:06] when I'm 35. Who knows? Only God
[31:10] knows. Now, I'm not saying it just to be
[31:12] a downer, but just so that we can
[31:14] understand that there's a purpose in our
[31:16] lives that God didn't just put us here
[31:19] for for chance and just to be like, "All
[31:21] right, let's see what they do." But let
[31:23] me see. Oh, this person only going to
[31:25] live 50 years. This person going to live
[31:27] a hundred and with no purpose. No, God
[31:30] set purposes.
[31:32] God set his word. We're not living so
[31:35] that we can have as much time as we
[31:37] want. We're living to fulfill a purpose.
[31:41] That's why we're here.
[31:43] So every time, every year that passes,
[31:46] it's more time
[31:49] used. Now the message we receive from
[31:51] God through a prophet, it's a message of
[31:54] little time.
[31:56] The message of the hour, last day
[31:59] message, end time message, evening light
[32:02] message. Keep going. These are all what
[32:04] people have labeled it. Why? It's a
[32:08] message of he's
[32:09] coming. It's time to change. It's it's
[32:12] time of a rapture. It's a time of a
[32:17] transformation. Now, the cry shouldn't
[32:20] be, "God, give me more time." You know,
[32:22] we want time. Lord, just give me more
[32:24] time. And and You know, I'll do this and
[32:27] I'll do
[32:28] that. Well, time for what?
[32:31] Right? Give me time to think about
[32:34] it. Give me Give me time to fix
[32:37] everything first. Give me time to to
[32:39] finish high school, right? Give me time
[32:42] to have a family first, Lord. Right. I
[32:46] was a young person. I That's the way I
[32:48] thought, too. I thought the rapture was
[32:50] going to happen way and I'm like, man,
[32:52] I'm not even going to
[32:54] graduate, right? We want more
[32:58] time. We want more time. Let Let me get
[33:01] my family good. Let Let me get a good
[33:03] job first. Let me have this. Let me have
[33:05] that. Let me do this
[33:07] first. But think about the Antalovian
[33:10] age. God gave them almost a thousand
[33:15] years to live. What did they do with it?
[33:19] that he gave him all those
[33:22] years. And here in Genesis 6:3, he says,
[33:25] "And the Lord said, "My spirit shall not
[33:27] always strive with man, for he is also
[33:30] flesh, yet his days shall be 120 years."
[33:35] Brother Brandham says God a generation
[33:37] is aotted time. A man's aotted time um
[33:41] on earth was 120 years which Noah took
[33:45] the period to build the ark which was
[33:48] considered a generation in that day. So
[33:50] here brother Ben Brandham's tying the
[33:51] two. So the 120 years wasn't just saying
[33:54] hey I'm going to give you 120 years of
[33:57] preaching but your lifespan has been cut
[34:00] short. 120 years.
[34:03] So now one generation at that time was
[34:06] only 120 years for them. Why? Because
[34:10] what did they do with that 900
[34:12] years? Think about our our 80 90 years
[34:16] that we
[34:17] live just it's just a spec with what
[34:21] they compared to what they had. So all
[34:24] the time that they had they they wasted
[34:26] it to where God says I'm cutting it
[34:28] short. So time is is not on our side if
[34:32] if we want to
[34:33] just use time for whatever. Time is a
[34:37] tool. Time is
[34:39] currency. Time is something that you'll
[34:42] never be able to get back. Whenever you
[34:44] have your time, whenever you have your
[34:45] youth, young people, man, use everything
[34:49] you can. Do everything you can to serve
[34:52] the Lord. Brother Brandham says your
[34:54] best are from to 20
[34:58] to serve the Lord. Why? Because still
[35:01] malleable. You're still able still able
[35:04] to serve the Lord. He says once you
[35:06] start hitting 21, you start beginning to
[35:08] be set on your ways.
[35:11] And and think about it. Whenever brother
[35:13] be went in behind the curtain of time,
[35:16] he said they were around 18 to 20 years
[35:18] old. So it is an age of
[35:20] eternity, right?
[35:23] So time is precious. Time is a
[35:25] commodity. Time is is is something that
[35:28] we need. Time isn't just
[35:30] whatever. We want more money or we want
[35:33] these things. Yet our time is every
[35:36] single second, every single minute,
[35:38] every single hour, every single day is
[35:40] just getting cut short, cut short, cut
[35:44] short. And there's a reason why we are
[35:47] in this earth.
[35:48] So, so he cut the lifespan almost a
[35:52] thousand years. The la the oldest person
[35:54] was Methuselah
[35:57] 969 down to 120. And now it's a miracle
[36:01] if we live past 90. Here in Psalms 90 um
[36:07] 10-12 um I had that all the way in the
[36:09] end, but I'm going to read it right now.
[36:11] It's Psalms 9010-12. He says in the New
[36:14] International Version, he says, "Our
[36:16] days come to 70 years or 80 if our
[36:19] strength
[36:20] endures. Yet the best of them are are
[36:24] but trouble and sorrow and for they
[36:27] quickly pass and we fly away." If we
[36:30] only knew the power of your anger and
[36:32] the wrath that is great and as the fear
[36:35] as as your due. teach us to number our
[36:38] days that we may gain the heart of
[36:41] wisdom to number our
[36:44] days to
[36:45] to recognize the time or the the the
[36:50] precious thing we have in our
[36:53] lives. So our he's saying average age is
[36:57] about 70. Now after that it's borrow
[36:59] time. He's basically saying and then
[37:02] once you hit 80 he says then you're
[37:04] you're in the years of strength. He
[37:07] says you know when when I was um younger
[37:10] I didn't really understand I would think
[37:13] about how how he did that. I'm like wow
[37:15] this is harsh how he cut it to 120 years
[37:18] and God must have been so angry to cut
[37:21] lifespan to 120 years because we want to
[37:24] live forever right? But brothers, to my
[37:28] surprise, I understand this. It's
[37:29] nothing but the grace of
[37:31] God. That that cutting the time short is
[37:35] grace.
[37:37] One of the reasons time was placed was
[37:39] to eliminate sin. You have to think
[37:41] about that that when sin entered in,
[37:44] time entered in and it put a time stamp
[37:47] on on sin. It put time on evil. It put
[37:52] time on the bad times. If not, it would
[37:55] have been rolling into
[37:57] eternity. So, one of the reasons was so
[38:00] that he could have an an a date of death
[38:04] for
[38:06] sin. The longer people allow sin to rule
[38:09] in their lives, the more wicked the
[38:11] people are. We see that in the
[38:12] Antalivian days. Sin doesn't age well.
[38:17] Sin is like a cancer that will not stop
[38:19] until it consumes its victim. Yes. So
[38:23] the longer this we allow this evil days
[38:26] to just roll and roll and roll, well,
[38:28] look at what we see now.
[38:31] It's just it's gray. It's not even like
[38:34] brother, like Jesus says, it's lukewarm.
[38:37] It
[38:38] it's an evil
[38:40] day. Mark 13:20, it says, "And except
[38:44] the Lord had shortened the days, no
[38:47] flesh would be saved. But for the
[38:49] elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he
[38:52] hath shortened the
[38:54] days. So for the elect's sake, he
[38:57] shortened
[38:59] days. Brother Brandham, he says, and and
[39:02] it well here, brother Brandham starts
[39:06] talking about Hezekiah, and this is a
[39:09] good
[39:11] explaning the days. Hezekiah was about
[39:15] to die, and God says, "Get your
[39:17] everything in order. get your house in
[39:19] order because your time is at hand. Now,
[39:22] this man was right with God at that
[39:25] time. He was right. He was a righteous
[39:28] man and and he cried out to the Lord and
[39:31] the Lord and he cried out to the Lord
[39:32] for 15 more years. He sort said, "Lord,
[39:36] just give me more time. Give me more
[39:38] time and and I'll dedicate it to you.
[39:40] Lord, give me more time." That's us.
[39:42] Lord, give me more time. I just need
[39:44] more time. God granted it to him.
[39:48] And what
[39:49] happened? He says, "And he opened up
[39:52] there where Ez um Isaiah was sent to
[39:55] Hezekiah to pronounce to him his time
[39:58] has come. Come and and uh Hezekiah
[40:01] turned his face to the wall and prayed
[40:02] to the Lord." And the Lord heard his
[40:04] voice and come back and spoke to Isaiah
[40:06] and go tell him, "I spared 15 years." Do
[40:09] you remember that? Now, in the in the
[40:12] next message, um does God ever change
[40:14] his mind about his word? He says, "And
[40:16] what did he do?" Now we see the result
[40:18] of this 15 years. He says, "He brought
[40:21] disgrace upon the whole nation. He
[40:24] kindled the anger of God till he would
[40:27] have killed him." That's right. You know
[40:30] that backslid on God. It it would have
[40:34] been far better off
[40:37] um nation king and all if he hadn't went
[40:41] on and took God's first thing to him. if
[40:44] he went and took God's first
[40:46] thing. So he would have been better off
[40:48] to say, "All right, Lord, take my life,
[40:51] but because more
[40:52] time then it caused him to fall." So
[40:56] this is not a a matter of time. Lord,
[40:59] give me more time. Lord, give me more
[41:02] years. Let me be a a in a ripe old age.
[41:05] And I'm not saying, you know, we should
[41:06] desire to die early. I'm just saying
[41:08] that time is not in our side when we
[41:11] want to just go and do what we want to
[41:13] do and say Lord just give me time and
[41:16] I'll figure things
[41:17] out. God has set time limits for
[41:21] everything.
[41:23] So so now we understand something that
[41:25] that it's not the amount of time we
[41:28] possess which brings the value but the
[41:30] value is what we are doing with that a
[41:33] lot of time.
[41:35] What are we doing with the time? How
[41:37] many seconds have we wasted? Have I
[41:40] wasted? How many minutes and hours and
[41:44] days and weeks and months and
[41:47] years? Every second counts. You know, I
[41:51] like the the analogy of Rome wasn't
[41:53] built in a day. Well, it wasn't torn
[41:56] down in a day either. It took same thing
[41:59] brick by brick every single day. What
[42:03] are we doing for the Lord?
[42:07] Ephesians um if we go back to Ephesians
[42:11] 5:14-16 it says wherefore he saith awake
[42:15] thou that sleepest and arise from the
[42:18] dead and Christ shall give thee light
[42:22] see that you walk circumspectly not as
[42:25] fools but as wise redeeming the time
[42:28] because the days are evil now to redeem
[42:31] doesn't mean you you get to get back
[42:33] your time once we waste our time. That's
[42:37] it. There's no way to buy back time. But
[42:40] in a sense, this word means to recover
[42:43] or to make the most of something
[42:46] valuable. So, so to redeem the time, it
[42:49] means whatever we have
[42:51] left, whatever whatever time we have,
[42:54] let's make the best of it.
[42:58] Let's do something because it's
[43:00] valuable.
[43:02] So he's time saying to use our time
[43:05] wisely
[43:07] implies urgency and intent intentiality.
[43:12] Every moment is an opportunity to live
[43:14] for Christ. Grow in faith. Help others
[43:18] fulfill your purpose. Now this doesn't
[43:21] mean that we we just live like away from
[43:24] the world. No, we live with our
[43:26] ambitions. Young people, you want to go
[43:28] do those things, but yet you have Christ
[43:30] in the center of your life. In
[43:32] everything you do, you give God the
[43:34] glory.
[43:36] And everywhere you go, you Christ is
[43:39] there with you.
[43:41] So every step, everything you do,
[43:43] wherever you go, whatever you want to
[43:45] study, Christ is there. What is it?
[43:48] You're redeeming the time.
[43:51] Time is the word chios, which means
[43:54] opportunity.
[43:56] So redeeming the opportunity that you
[43:59] have, you know, in sales there's a word
[44:01] called or there's a phrase called a
[44:03] window of opportunity.
[44:06] Whenever you see that window, seize it.
[44:09] Go for it. Do what you got to do. That's
[44:12] what God has given us, a window.
[44:15] Man, 50 years, that's a long time. 70
[44:18] years, 80
[44:19] years, it's just not even a speck in
[44:22] God's
[44:24] eyes in compared to eternity. It's
[44:28] nothing. The Bible says that we are like
[44:31] grass that wither
[44:35] away. It seems like time, well, man, I'm
[44:38] young or I'm middle-aged. I'm good. I'm
[44:40] this. But one day, we're going to wake
[44:42] up and we're going to say, "What did I
[44:43] do with my time?
[44:46] What did I do?
[44:48] We have a window of opportunity,
[44:51] something that is not to be wasted.
[44:54] There's this uh I was just looking up
[44:56] quotes. Harvey McKay, he says, "Time is
[44:58] free, but it's
[44:59] priceless. You can't own it, but you can
[45:03] use it. You can't keep it, but you can
[45:06] spend it. Once you've lost it, you can
[45:08] never get it back." Another one by Paul
[45:12] um J. Meer. He says most time is wasted
[45:15] not in hours but in minutes. A bucket
[45:19] with a small hole is in the b with a
[45:22] small hole in the bottom just gets gets
[45:25] just as empty as the deliberate kick
[45:28] kicking over of the
[45:30] bucket. So what are we doing with our
[45:34] time? Every season to everything there
[45:38] is a season to every time there's a
[45:40] purpose.
[45:42] So every time that we have purpose is
[45:45] there. That's how God tells time. We
[45:48] tell times by these these watches we
[45:50] have the clocks the all these things.
[45:53] God he time by
[45:56] purpose. Every time there is purpose and
[46:00] whenever purpose is fulfilled the time
[46:02] is done.
[46:05] Here we can see it in 70th week of
[46:07] Daniel. He says then there is a lot of
[46:09] time but nobody knows it when when it
[46:12] will be. See it's a mystery. See the
[46:14] Gentiles time but the Jews we cannot
[46:17] tell the time by what the church by what
[46:20] the church whether it's backslid or
[46:22] whether it um it's going on or what it's
[46:25] doing. You can't tell by that. But look
[46:28] at the Jews. There is the time calendar.
[46:32] Do you see it? God did not lot them uh
[46:36] uh uh exactly the day and the hour and
[46:39] the time, but he never uh the Gentiles.
[46:42] He did the Jews. So, let's watch the
[46:45] Jews, then we'll see where we're at. So,
[46:49] whatever purpose that these Jews had,
[46:52] when we see it, when the purpose is
[46:55] done, the time is over.
[46:58] The Bible says when you see the leaves
[47:01] start butdding fruit, he says summer is
[47:05] ready. It's
[47:07] here. So in if in reality if we look at
[47:11] our lives, we see what God each and
[47:14] every person has a gift today. Each and
[47:17] every person has a purpose. Each and
[47:19] every person has something God wants
[47:21] them to do. Amen. Whether it's big or
[47:24] small, God has something for us to do to
[47:27] accomplish. Well, brother, I'm just
[47:29] this. Well, I'm this young or I'm this
[47:32] old. It doesn't matter. You have
[47:34] purpose.
[47:35] And you are your days are numbered by
[47:39] the purpose that fulfilled.
[47:42] That makes me happy. It makes me
[47:45] understand that I don't die of old age.
[47:48] That I'm not going to die of because of
[47:50] this. Maybe that was the cause. Or maybe
[47:53] that was the reason or the thing that
[47:56] caused me to die. But I died because my
[47:58] purpose was fulfilled
[48:01] because I did something. And God says,
[48:03] "All right, you're done."
[48:06] That's how God tells our
[48:10] purpose. He says in in the path of life,
[48:14] he says, "Grant it, Lord. Help us as we
[48:16] pull together for this purpose. We
[48:18] commit ourselves to you. We are yours.
[48:21] do with us, Lord, as you see fit. We
[48:24] commit ourselves this morning in the
[48:26] synagogue into your hands, Lord, that
[48:28] your that may uh that and may your great
[48:32] purpose be achieved in our lives as we
[48:34] give ourselves wholly to you, not as
[48:38] Samson. So, every single person has a
[48:41] purpose and every purpose has a time
[48:44] limit called the window of opportunity.
[48:48] There's a
[48:49] time and and it's
[48:51] limited and and and it's the limited
[48:55] period during which an action and a
[48:58] process takes place. Time is this time
[49:01] that we're living in. It's where we
[49:04] begin to act to determine our inter
[49:07] eternity. So in time, we're working,
[49:10] we're acting, we're achieving, we're
[49:12] we're doing all these things to
[49:14] determine our eternity output.
[49:17] We're working. This is not a time to
[49:20] just say, "YOLO, you were living, you
[49:22] know, you only live one life and
[49:24] whatever, all these things." You're
[49:27] working. You're you're achieving. You're
[49:30] you're you're just as as uh as Abraham,
[49:34] you're you're wandering, searching for
[49:36] that
[49:38] city. You know Jesus in in uh John 9:4
[49:43] he says I must work the works of him
[49:46] that that sent me while it is day. The
[49:49] night cometh when no man can work. What
[49:52] is it? A window of
[49:53] opportunity. He he had an aotted time.
[49:57] Now you have to think about it. Jesus he
[50:00] lived for 33
[50:02] years. And out of those 33
[50:05] years, he only had a window of
[50:07] opportunity of three and a half
[50:11] years. Now just think about it. You go
[50:14] to Africa, you go to India, you go to
[50:17] South America, you go to North America,
[50:19] you go to Europe, you go to all these
[50:21] places and they know about Jesus. And
[50:25] this man only worked for three and a
[50:27] half
[50:28] years. Time. We don't need time when we
[50:31] have purpose.
[50:33] We don't we don't need a lot of time.
[50:36] God, give me purpose. God, let me be in
[50:40] your word. L L Lord, let me stand on
[50:43] your word with all I have.
[50:46] This man, nobody knew.
[50:49] 99.999 of the world percent of the world
[50:52] didn't know who Jesus was when he was
[50:54] walking on the earth. Yet, he was
[50:57] fulfilling his purpose for three and a
[50:59] half years. He lived to his full
[51:01] potential. He gave everything he could
[51:04] could. He was like a poor drink. He
[51:08] didn't reserve
[51:09] anything. You know, that's as people we
[51:13] we have we have so much
[51:16] eternity in us. That that's that's a
[51:19] wrong word to say because so much and
[51:21] eternity don't mix. But we have so much
[51:26] potential, so much purpose, so much
[51:30] stored within
[51:32] us. And it's not just for our benefit,
[51:35] but it's so that we can just give out to
[51:37] the world. That's what Jesus
[51:40] did. And he only lived three and a three
[51:43] and a half years fulfilling that
[51:46] purpose. Imagine if he died at 80.
[51:49] Imagine if how much he would have done.
[51:53] Like all the things he would have done
[51:54] if he lived all the way to 80. It would
[51:57] have been mindblowing,
[51:59] right? But he didn't need 80. He didn't
[52:02] need to go to 80. He only needed 33
[52:06] years. That's all he
[52:08] needed. As much as we feel like we want
[52:10] to live a long life, what if I told you
[52:12] that that when we
[52:14] die, we said everything we needed to
[52:17] say. When we go with the Lord, we prayed
[52:20] every prayer we needed to
[52:23] pray. We we did everything we needed to
[52:26] do when we go out to the Lord. So, so
[52:30] sometimes when somebody leaves, just
[52:33] recently my my aunt left and it's so
[52:36] easy to say, "Oh man, I didn't talk to
[52:38] her enough. Man, I just wish I sat
[52:41] there." Now, I'm sure maybe most of us
[52:44] felt that way somehow with someone say,
[52:47] "Man, I wish I just had more
[52:50] time. Wish she could have spoke to me
[52:52] more because they were a Christian. My
[52:54] father, oh, I wish I I had more time
[52:56] with
[52:57] him." He said everything he needed to
[53:00] say to
[53:01] me. He did everything he needed to do
[53:04] and nothing more and nothing less. If
[53:07] you're in God's will, you you you can
[53:09] leave this world saying it is
[53:12] finished. See, Jesus when he died on the
[53:14] cross, he died
[53:16] empty. He didn't die with anything
[53:19] reserved. He didn't die with anything
[53:21] that was saying, "Man, I should have
[53:23] done that, man." No. What did he say? It
[53:26] is finished. It's done. Everything I
[53:30] needed to do, it's done.
[53:33] Paul in one of the scriptures, he he
[53:35] said, "I I I look forward. I there's
[53:37] things that I I haven't grasped yet, and
[53:39] I'm still running and walking towards
[53:42] those things. I'm grasping for those
[53:44] things." Then then he goes and talks to
[53:46] Timothy, and he says, "I'm done.
[53:50] I fought the fi fight. I' I I've done
[53:53] all these things." And he actually says,
[53:56] "I'm like a drink poured out.
[53:59] My day is done." Isn't that amazing to
[54:03] be saying Lord I'm like a drink that has
[54:06] been poured
[54:08] out. That word or the phrase is actually
[54:11] I'm like a drink
[54:13] offering in in the Old Testament. That's
[54:15] what they would do whenever they would
[54:17] sacrifice the lamb and all of that for
[54:18] sweet savor to the Lord. They would also
[54:21] have a a glass of wine or a thing of
[54:25] wine and they would it would be a poured
[54:27] offering to the Lord.
[54:30] that wine, that water, whatever you want
[54:32] to call it, is is the pleasures of our
[54:36] life. It's the things that that we want
[54:39] to do. We could drink it or we can just
[54:44] pour it to the
[54:45] Lord. And it's not going to be counted
[54:48] wasted.
[54:49] It's not going to be
[54:51] counted disgrace. It's not going to be
[54:53] counted that, oh man, I didn't do that
[54:56] or I didn't do this. No, you pour it and
[54:59] you give it to the
[55:02] Lord because that's what our purpose
[55:06] is. We're our purpose is to leave this
[55:09] earth
[55:10] empty. Our purpose is to leave here
[55:14] knowing that we give given everything to
[55:16] the
[55:18] Lord. Let us uh stand to our
[55:22] feet. That that's my prayer. You know
[55:26] with this world we have to think
[55:29] about all the
[55:32] technology all the
[55:36] the things that can waste our
[55:40] time all the things all entertainments
[55:44] all the things in the world it can waste
[55:46] our
[55:47] time but when we can dedicate our time
[55:50] to the Lord every and say Lord I've done
[55:55] everything I could. I I believe we
[55:57] fulfilled the purpose that God has in
[56:00] store for us and we've properly redeemed
[56:03] the time. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly
[56:09] Father, Lord, we're just so thankful for
[56:11] your goodness, Lord, for your grace that
[56:14] you have given us. If it wasn't for you,
[56:17] Lord, we would be in a horrible place.
[56:19] But, Father, you've given us a time to
[56:22] repent.
[56:23] Father, you've given us everything we
[56:26] needed so that we can turn our lives and
[56:28] now we have people here dedicated in
[56:31] their lives.
[56:32] Father, Lord, I just ask that you
[56:34] continue to allow us to fulfill every
[56:37] single day with your purpose being
[56:40] fulfilled. Allow us to walk in your way
[56:42] every single day. Father, allow us to
[56:45] know how great your purpose is in our
[56:48] lives.
[56:49] Lord, I ask a special blessing for each
[56:51] and every person. In the name of the
[56:53] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And
[56:56] amen.
