TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matthew chapter 6 verse 9 matthew chapter 6 verse 9 and we'll read to verse 13. we're continuing on the thought of eating to live and we've been examining the subject of being hungry and taking the word of god and eating it and feeding on the right things and so i'd like to kind of finish up what we were exploring last wednesday night and then take a little bit of a turn of a corner hopefully about midway through to begin to look at what's inspired me about this uh eating and its appropriateness for the hour that we're living in matthew chapter six verse nine after this manner therefore pray ye so jesus is teaching his disciples to pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen you may be seated i'd like to read a statement at the outset uh it's a little bit out of the way maybe um in the flow of the service i i'd been pondering maybe to use it at the end but i had was just reading today and studying and i came across this statement and i was so uh moved by it and i thought it was so profound i sent it along to a number of my friends even some that probably wouldn't even normally text they just all of a sudden get a quote from me and they think well this must be substantial but um i want to read it just at the outset and maybe it will i think you can see where it'll tie in but brother branham this sermon separation from unbelief he says it's a bad way for you to come to church at night expecting to get healed and i can say expecting anything and he says without having a good long season of prayer before you leave home and so he's kind of and i would say this is certainly appropriate if you're looking for healing and you're looking for god to come and do something very supernatural touch you in a particular area of life that you have to have the sincerity with which you approach the um approach the lord and approach his gift and the opportunity that he gives in a church service and this is what he says we ought to pray in this uh long season of prayer as he calls it say lord i want you tonight to do something for me when i get down down there tonight may the holy spirit just sink every word in my heart and faithful anchor there and i can raise right up in the meeting and get my healing and walk away perfectly whole and this is really god's uh preferred method this is god's way of giving us healing is through the word this is the bride's way as she matures to come to a place where she takes him at his word and the preaching of the word of god produces these great signs and wonders in our midst and in our hearts and in our lives so he says let every word sink into my heart let faith anchor and i'm going to leave perfectly whole he says but this is kind of like the opposite of what happens he says then you'll get healing then you will go get getting healed but so this is the way to approach him in the season of prayer approaching service with this mindset this attitude says but if you eat a great big supper fuss around the house a while argue all the way down why then when you come down here you'll probably go back the same way you come in and it's remarkable and i think we could all say amen to that how we have often just come especially maybe on a wednesday night where we've eaten a big supper we've had certain things going on and taking place and there's fussing and fighting and there's a lot of commotion and we just make it in time to service and we're not in the state of mind and we're not in the right frame of expectation under the right kind of expectation to really receive something from god and when we leave maybe we're leaving the same way we came in and and you could say well you could ask me well what what you want me to take away from this i think one would be to establish a good habit before going to church and reminding ourselves that we're not just going to church we don't come to hear the word of god the same way we'd go to baseball practice or the same way we'd go to top flight golf the way we'd go to dinner there's just there's a way that we want to approach this because this is more than just a natural gathering this is more than just a place where we expect to hear something that would teach us some good real estate investment tips or ways to approach the stock market this is an opportunity to hear from god so we approach it with a mindset i'm going to come and i'm going to hear from the lord and if you if you leave a service and you feel hey i really don't think i really got anything out of that it's always it's always good to first self-examine and ask yourself well how did i in what condition did i arrive to church in was there a big was there a big supper and a lot of fuss and a lot of fight and you just kind of make it in and then you kind of we show up and kind of said this all right fix me preacher all right tell me something new uh give me the word of god and we leave well i didn't get much out of service it's important to step back and ask ourselves well was i in a position to receive something did i approach it the right way was i was in the frame of mind where when the man of god began to get into a particular area that would have been beneficial to me i was in i was able to kind of catch what was being said and be in harmony with the holy spirit and i thought this statement was just really really profound and really struck me so i wanted to share it in the outset and i think it does speak to the subject of eating to live because it talks about our mindset and our attitude when we come to hear the word are we coming prayerfully are we coming with the attitude that i want to receive something from you and are we asking holy spirit let every word sink into my heart where faith can anchor so that i can walk away better can walk away having heard from god and having been benefited i think that's a wonderful statement in second timothy chapter four we want to read verses two to four and this will be just picking right back up where we were before second timothy chapter four verses two to four paul instructing timothy says preach the word the instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine the people will not be able to handle pure teaching good teaching sound doctrine that's sound doctor means something that's not mixed with air and has opinions and other things mixed into it they they will not be able to stomach it as we pointed out last time and he says but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers they still want to hear they just don't want to hear sound doctrine they still want to be taught they just don't want to be taught sound doctrine they'll heap to themselves teachers having itching ears this is a they have a an itch that needs to be scratched they they want to hear it a particular way they want to hear a specific doctrine expounded upon they actually need needed to be within a particular channel or maybe even a certain manner like if the preacher doesn't get really worked up then wow that didn't really suit my fancy and others can be well if the preacher gets too worked up well that kind of offends me i don't like it when they move around that much i don't like it when they get loud and so they have a taste that they want to get when they're hearing the word and it says this causes them they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables and we took this scripture just to point out that something had changed in their diet something had changed in their appetite to where they can't stomach the word of god he's saying there's going to be a time when the people will not be able to stomach the word but they're actually going to crave things that are not spiritually healthy they're still going to have a crave for spiritual things they're still going to have a language that may refer to biblical things and scriptural things and things pertaining to the word but then it cannot be sound otherwise they don't want to eat it there has to be some personality mixed into it something else in it so they can okay that's good enough that i can eat that we may we all may know some some people that will eat anything as long as there's enough hot sauce on it and there's certain people like that and some people even just by virtue of uh smoking seven packs a day for their whole lives have to add enough tabasco to things just so that they can taste it and in some ways that may be exactly how some people approach the word of god you have to add things in it has to be in a particular package it has to be served a particular way otherwise they don't want it if it's just the pure word coming in a pure way they can't stomach it but then they still crave for something but what they crave for isn't going to build them up spiritually and so we saw even in the scripture how by not feeding on the truth it causes you to turn from the truth where they left their first love and they had not learned to love the truth here it says they shall be turned to fables so they begin to build this appetite for fables they begin to have this craving this taste i need to hear fiction i need to hear a story i need to hear something in it and so this is kind of those are some of the things that we were speaking on last time and how brother ram talks about they're cutting away the very value of the word they're taking the word which is pure and they're taking the benefit out of it because god is in his word and you can't take the word and change it and then expect to get the full benefits of the word there has to be there has it has to be the word it can't you can't preach jesus and add something to it and say well i'm preaching jesus there's not another jesus you can't add to or take away from the word and still be preaching the word so by changing the word it deprives the hear or as we're pointing it out this way it deprives the eater of the nutrients that the word has the essential ingredients in the word that's supposed to give us this energy and this strength and this power if you change the word or you mix something into the word or you cut it in half you take out the power and the effectiveness of the word that we made reference to kind of hybrid and even genetically modified you could take those principles in our natural diet how so if something can be pure if something is not hybrid if something's not mixed in there's something different about the original seed there's something different about those plants that are organic and they have better nutrients and our body can better relate to them and and use them in a better way that's kind of a principle that i want you to think about so we were identifying scripturally how that there's a cycle of how the wrong diet leads to the wrong kind of cravings paul says they don't endure sound doctrine but they heap to themselves teachers and what they're hearing doesn't cause them to turn back to the word but it actually causes them to crave the wrong things and it has to have something to itch scratch their itch their ears or tickle their ears and in doing so you eat the wrong things you begin to crave the wrong things and so it creates a cycle that begins to perpetuate and how is it that you have to get out of it in the natural sometimes you have to go on a diet have to go on a fast or go on some sort of cleanse to do what kind of break the cravings so you can say no to the the pound cake or the pound of pound cake so you can say no to the you know did you know they're handing out free donuts to anybody that got a vaccine sign me up there's a dozen vac dozen krispy kreme donuts because you got a vaccine and you feel like well it's my civic duty not only to get the vaccine but also eat a dozen donuts for getting it and you find yourself craving these things after you eat a meal that should completely satisfy what happens well i i want to have the i don't is there still claim jumpers nearby they have do they still have that boston cream dessert that's like a foot and a half long right foot long i ordered a foot in half long and what do you do you have to eat the whole thing you have to have that after you eat dinner and you have to eat it this is the cycle of eating the wrong things and then craving the wrong things and it just keeps perpetuating and the point spiritually is if you're in that cycle when it comes to church when you're in that cycle when it comes to the message of the hour if you're in that cycle in terms of following jesus christ it's going to weaken your appetite for the pure word it's going to have to be in a particular way it's going to have to maybe even be a particular preacher it's going to have to be it's going to have to say a certain thing or you're just not going to really have the patience for it if you're feeding on the wrong things it's going to weaken your appetite for the pure word of god in proverbs chapter 13 verse 25 says the righteous edith to the satisfying of his soul but the belly of the wicked shall want and some translations render this to the righteous eat to live and the wicked live to eat and there's a this is a saying that i think has its root in scripture even socrates said bad men live that they may eat and drink whereas good men eat and drink that they may live and we realize that we all we all have to we all live to eat in the sense that you know because we're alive we can eat again and if you're eating you want to enjoy it but it's identifying a mindset it's identifying an approach to eating or a perspective on eating it says the righteous eat some of the translations and the wording means the righteous eat and they're satisfied so the right way to eat brings satisfaction it brings contentment it brings fulfillment and as brother branham was even identifying if you don't come to church with prayerfully and under expectation and say lord feed my soul then you walk away and you go back the same way you came in you go out hungry why because you haven't approached the the the meal you haven't approached the service you haven't come to it with this attitude of i need something i want something and therefore when you eat you leave satisfied if you come you say well i ate i heard every word i said amen but if you don't leave satisfied then maybe something is wrong in how whether or not your approach to eating is correct so feasting on the word should bring contentment it should even provoke the right desire it produces the right thing but it says the wicked eat and still want the belly of the wick and still want so they eat and they're left dissatisfied so here's two different eaters they sit down they eat one eats and is happy and is satisfied another one eats but he's left dissatisfied and it and as a consequence is unhealthy so in one side and even putting this in natural terms you have the righteous who eat and then are satisfied that's someone who's eating healthy then you have on the other side the wicked who eats but then he's dissatisfied his belly still wants that's eating wrong eating poorly so you have these two different sides that we're using this type of eating and a natural diet to understand so you have one that eats and receives contentment and can live spiritually healthy the other who's eating but yet since it's not contenting him there's still maybe more eating but it's not giving him the spiritual benefit of what he's supposedly eating should give them and so i want to use an example of this in the natural and they have found through various different studies that people who are unhealthy have fewer dopamine receptors than healthy people and so you have these dopamine receptors that are going to kind of fire off they're going to catch things they're going to get signals they're going to receive input and then it's going to create a stimulus when you eat and so they say that and these dopamine receptors are related to our neurological processes so they're supposed to they even say that these receptors these dopamine receptors relate to motivation and pleasure and memory and learning and and the control of signaling all the neurons signaling to your body so this is a real important part of how our mind works so i have these dopamine receptors and it relates to my motivation and my memory and my ability to learn and my control these different things and so what they found with the unhealthy people is that without the these enough dopamine receptors or real healthy and vital receptors when they eat they derive less pleasure from eating and in receiving less pleasure from eating it leads to bad cravings so this is the science behind why you can eat and you and you want to eat more and you want to keep eating more and you want to keep eating more they call it heat and eating where you're eating merely for pleasure consuming food for pleasure and you're not consuming food to maintain what they call energy homeostasis write it down you can feel educated you can go past a certification i'm sure by the end of this service and be and be at least a a nutritional assistant or something so they say that these people who don't have these fewer dopamine receptors they're eating for pleasure and they're eating just to satisfy cravings and they're not eating really because they're hungry and they've depleted their energy and they need to maintain this their energy levels it's energy homeostasis or homeostasis is the state of optimal steady functioning of a living organism so you eat so that you're in an optimal state you eat i give myself um i'm eating calories i'm eating substance so that my body can stay in this this state of optimal functioning i'm a living organism i have to take things i have to feed on things i have to put things into my body and i do that because energy is being depleted i need to maintain these energy stores and this is energy homeostasis i need to maintain vital function so energy homeostasis is the regulation of food intake in energy expenditure what is that food in or energy in through the food which is how a calorie is a measure of energy so you're consuming this and then there should be energy out now that's how it ought to work that's an optimally functioning uh uh body they say if you want to maintain weight they figure by your height and your in your gender and and uh and your weight that this is how many calories you need a day this is how much energy in you need a day to maintain weight based upon they figure this is how much energy a person of your size and weight and age and build and gender is going to burn so the energy in ought to be expended and not to be used up and this should keep you in this optimal state of functioning but in an unhealthy condition a person is eating because of the psychological reward and not because their energy need they're following this when they when someone is eating in this heating a hedonic eating or this they have fewer dopamine receptors they're eating but they're not eating because they they want to reserve enter they want to store energy or because they need energy they're eating just because of a psychological reward and if as i say this if it's to you kind of saying well isn't that what eating is all about i mean i join with you i i don't find myself typically when i'm eating saying well i want to be sure that i i i get enough energy in because i'm expending energy i'm generally hey where do you want to go eat and we begin to think in terms of what sounds good what's going to taste good what's going to scratch the itch of my pleasure center where and i want to eat for psychological reward and i'm not saying well what's the place where i can eat and i'll receive an optimal amount of calories that'll balance out the energy that's been expended and give me some reserves in order to make it through the remainder of the day i don't approach eating that way and if all of you do then you know how to pray for me i'm generally looking for something that's good and something that's rich and something that i'm is going to be four stars and the palette uh category like hey that was awesome we need to go back that was good and i'm not walking away saying wow that was that's that should fill up my energy needs i'm in a state of energy depletion and i need to consume energy so that i can remain at this optimal state no that's the person you don't invite to lunch but in understanding this this negative way that we can eat as humans this it's i'm wanting you to look at this how there's kind of a there's a context so there's a way you use that as a type how we approach spiritual eating but they call this eating that's driven by pleasure and when you're eating and it's driven by pleasure you say well there may have been nothing wrong with choosing a place that sounds good and has good food and you enjoy it but it begins to feed a habit to where the the meal you ate the entree wasn't enough you need to see the dessert menu and i said would you like to see the dessert train you said yes i would actually i would like to see the whole thing and if you could just leave it here it'll be fine we'll take care of it and so you begin to crave things you begin to crave sweets you begin to want to eat a dessert even after a satisfying meal you have cravings towards the end of the day you need something more you need something more that's not the body itself telling you that it needs more calories to maintain an optimal state of functioning that's the pleasure center of your mind your psychology saying i'm hungry i'm craving i want to i want something to hit the spot i need something to kind of scratch that itch and you may have already received enough calories from what you received what you ate in the meal but how many times we even says well that just didn't hit the what the spot and by spot we don't mean the stomach we really don't even need the mean the mouth cause it all made it down our pie hole right and it's made it it's it's on its way to work its way through the digestive system but we say well it just didn't hit the spot it's the psychological part that's not satisfying and this is when you're we can say you're probably in an unhealthy state of mind because it's then that you say well you know what why don't we just go ahead and order pizza you just had a whole meal well it just didn't hit the spot let me eat a whole gallon of bluebell rocky road ice cream because it didn't hit the spot and that's the way that we can respond and act when we're now eating for pleasure and we're not eating for need and so consumption for food or consumption of food for pleasure has become more and more common in our society and in doing so it's become more problematic dozens of studies have been done on it i say dozens dozens and dozens of studies have been done they're looking at how that we have made available cheap processed foods and how that you can just grab a bag of chips you could grab a diet coke and you can eat that and it doesn't it's not really going to give you the the true contentment and satisfaction the body needs it's just going to set you up for more cravings later you're going to want another you're going to want this and you're going to want that and these are things that we begin to consume in the natural which creates bad habits in the natural now i want to use this as a type when the bible says a righteous man eats to the satisfying of his soul that means when he's eating it brings contentment and satisfaction it brings a benefit whereas the wicked when he eats he's still left satisfies and he's still left unsat dissatisfied and so he still has a hunger he still has a craving and there's a way that we can put this to where if the word is not satisfying you you're going to seek something to satisfy you and if we're not finding our pleasure in the word of god we could find ourselves getting pulled into other things as kind of a release or an escape or a way to feel feel some sort of enjoyment or satisfaction and so it can tend to the wrong kind of living or an unsanctified lifestyle or mistakes that are made through the course of the day that might tend to things that are not pleasing to the lord in terms of temper and indulgence or things like that so i could use it in that context but within the context of what our spiritual appetite is we do not want to be come to a place of spiritually eating where we're just kind of in a traditionally approaching church traditionally approaching the word of god and we're just kind of scratching an itch and we're eating more out of pleasure for a psychological reward instead of actually feeding our souls and that's that's the point behind me using the phrase eating to live we're challenging our mindset when it comes to our interaction with the word how am i interacting with it am i am i taking the word and the word only am i taking the pure word and feeding on it because i have a a very sensitized conscious to the fact that i need this and i need what's in it and i have an energy need and and i'm i'm doing things that are pleasing to lord our desire to do things pleasing the lord we could even say right now if you want to live a christian life you want to do things that are pleasing to the lord you're going to need the energy of the word to expend that energy and so am i how am i interacting with the word am i interacting it within a way that what i'm actually receiving is my body's spiritual energy needs or am i interacting with it where i'm just getting the psychological reward it's an interesting thing to think about should we break out do we have a breakout session and get into discussion groups and ponder this for a moment because it's relevant it's very pertinent it's important to think about this because we can get into habits of even listening to the word of god and it's only become background noise and it's just there really to scratch a psychological itch and we don't have these times where we're interacting in it from the point of need i need this i need to hear this and it would beg the question of what things are we feeding on what if there's if there's if there's things going out what's coming in there's a phrase in computing uh programming or code garbage in garbage out you know if there's a there's it's got to be putting the right things in if you want the right things out and so are we eating are we eating to feed the soul are we meeting because of a spiritual energy need or are we just tickling our ears that's the question we're asking and so feeding on the wrong things i want you to see how brother bradham identifies this in the message and thirst and what i want you to see is how he takes the same type and i didn't have time maybe to expound upon these different places where he says this uh because he's using the point in the natural to refer to what's taking place in the spiritual let me say this feeding on the wrong things instigates a destructive cycle for not eating the right things we deteriorate in health naturally but now looking at spiritually if we're not feeding on the wrong right things and if we're not feeding the right way with the right approach and the right attitude it puts us in a cycle to where we're not getting the energy in that we need and then we begin to say crave and long and want to have but the things we crave for are not going to put us in the right kind of spiritual health so we're talking about spiritual diet brother branham says in the message thirst he says you see what's done it it's about the deteriorating of our human health it's been this hybrid food it's talking about the the the body changing for young girls and men and everyone he says this hybrid food and stuff we're eating see it's the stuff the food and the life that we're living scientist has brought it to us and in doing so they're killing you can i get a witness where's my hammond b3 backing me up in a moment like that that's exactly he's exactly the truth and this is what we believe and we had a prophet that was teaching us this back in the 50s and 60s and now you know all the all the nutritionists now are catching up to us saying oh no hybrid foods are bad and processed foods are bad and you shouldn't be eating this and you shouldn't be in that you say hey we've been believing that since we came to the message we've at least recognized that knew that the hybrid foods are causing cancers hybrid foods are causing health deficiencies hybrid foods are causing early menopause and and the changing of the physical body and it's all related to the foods that we're eating it's laid out it's it he lays this out of the message and he says it's the scientists who've done it and what is it he said was cutting away the value of the word the scientist so just as science has brought us a nutrition has brought us uh uh in my i just kind of said a phrase that makes me begin to think about our food pyramid and what you should eat for breakfast and a lot of times a lot of things that have framed uh those agendas and made those so important without getting into those let me just say it was the diamond lobby it was a diamond company that set that established the one month salary for an engagement ring that's not it's not tradition that's not in the word of god that's not something that men have done throughout ages that's not what's necessarily proper or right this is what de beers the diamond company wanted you to think that you better spend at least a month's salary on your engagement ring why so you'd buy a diamond when you buy a diamond you buy a lot and so not everyone who's told you what you should eat is always honest when they're telling you what you should eat that's why anytime someone tells me hey you really should be eating this all right what are you selling how did you know i have in my car here homemade granola bars that has everything in it that you'll ever need it's 100 flaxseed and don't eat too many at one time but i'm telling you this is what you need for optimal energy uh homeostasis i'm like oh okay you got to be careful sometimes people are selling you things and brother brahms identified how that this agenda and these scientists have offered us food and offered us nutritional things or things that are supposedly helpful to our nutrition he says but it's killing us the hybrid foods the changes the stuff that we're eating in the life we're living is deteriorating us so let me say this let's not let our spiritual receptors diminish if the wrong kind of eating an unhealthy lifestyle reduces the number of dopamine receptors or healthy dopamine receptors whereas one begins to eat they're not receiving the pleasure that they ought to receive and the contentment they ought to receive so they find themselves always craving to eat and craving to eat but never getting the real value and nutrients from it let us not let our spiritual discernment our spiritual taste and our spiritual appetite diminish let us not come to a place where our eating is driven by religion and not by life let it not be that there's things we say things we do things that we'll experience because we merely want to maintain religion and we're not eating because this is life or death why are you listening to that tape oh because i was told from headquarters that i better push play and obey you better be doing more than just doing that you better be doing it because it's life you better be doing it because you want to live not just because there's been some order given and i better do it no that that's how you begin to eat and it's unhealthy and what you do you just crave more human things more things of man and more nutrients that's been mixed into it and hybrid and perverted no i'd listen to the word of god because it's life or death i'm not eating to maintain religion i'm eating because i want to live and brother adam says in the message he cares do you care he says and these weaknesses of interbreeding of the foods that we are eating for life is weakening the body which causes cancer mental mental troubles and all kinds of diseases are setting in upon the human body because it is its weakness think about it scientific destroying themselves getting away from god's plan now there's a there's a way that we could look at this and say well the god gave the fruits and the herbs and he gave the cattle he gave certain things for man to eat and they ought to have just left it that way but when it came to food production and and the change from an agrarian society to a more production society and technological industrial society and these technological advancements you had to make food quickly had to process it you had to preserve it and there's all sorts of methods that begin to develop and science he says is destroying themselves and they've got away from god's plan now i want to get into god's plan and this is where we begin to turn the corner but notice what happens when you get away from god's plan and you hybrid the food and you're you weaken the body it causes cancer mental troubles all sorts of diseases because of the weakness of the food and the weakness of the food is actually what causes makes it strong economically or makes it strong for a capitalist because you want more of it you can't just get a little bit and go a long way you need more and you keep needing more and you need to keep needing more so scientific again scientists have brought it to us and are killing you now science has is destroying us destroying themselves and they've done it from getting away from god's plan now i'm talking about eating to live in a spiritual sense i'm not i'm talking about getting the word of god interacting with the word of god obeying the word of god not just so that we can satisfy a religious itch but we do it because it's life or death it's why we go to church it's why we obey the word of god that's why we do take communion and wash one another's feet it's why we pay our tithes it's why we give offerings it's why we it's why we live for others these all these things is part of feeding on the word of god expending energy in the word it's not religious function it's not the scratching itch it's not for pride or for politics or pretense it's so the word can have preeminence he says they get away from god's plan in the message greatest battle ever fought how many have listened to that lately a few of you i recommend listening to it it's a tremendous message and i've been pouring through it for some of these things we've been ministering on greatest battle ever fought he tries to show you satan does he tries to show you something better an easier way this is typically how it works with these processed foods they're easier they're just easier you just rip it open i was uh i was doing a um a shout out to dr andrew coffey uh he wanted me to do a sugar detox and i did it i did it with them and it's kind of like so what's what can you do and he said if it has a label on it don't eat it so i had elizabeth take all the labels off my favorite foods and it went great i mean the cleanse was a breeze really i don't know what the complaints were all about oh it the label speaks that this has gone through a process and it's easier for us just to take things that have a label on them say oh well this looks good you know it's it's uh you know there's no no carbs in it well but how many calories and how high in fat is it well it's just easy it's easier this way just to put it in these uh these ways of viewing things well i'm gonna eat all this and eat all that and sometimes the easier way is not the good way so he says he tries to show you a bet some something better an easier way or a more sensible plan but there's no more sensible plan than that which god laid down at the beginning there's no more sensible plan this is there's no more sensible plan than the plan that god laid down at the beginning and it is his word hold that word get a grip on it let it get a grip on you stay there with him that's exactly what we should do we should get a grip on it make sure it's got a grip on us and then stay there with it so god's plan god's plan for you to be spiritually healthy is not coming to church stay with me because this isn't our last service unless we're getting out of here in the meeting in the air and then it'll just be that eternal youth meeting there it's got to be part of an overall relationship with jesus christ in its right place otherwise can you believe it that actually going to church can hinder a lot of people because it just becomes part of their traditional approach to the message and at the end of the day they're not con they're not reading if i could just use this i know it says it has a label don't read it or you know don't eat it but they're not even reading the label on what they're eating anymore it doesn't matter well is it the message i mean is he quoting the message is it a message church i mean does he claim to believe the message okay all right i'm good and the only consideration people have anymore and say you know i hear there's a lot of good job opportunities in rhode island is there a church in rhode island i said yeah there's a church they don't even need to know what kind of church it is they just need to know there's a church there and they get there it's like there's not a message church in rhode island well you didn't ask about a message church you just asked about a church well that's what i meant well i didn't know that this church was this pastor believed in polygamy and had eight wives and the church was just nine people until i showed up well they're on the message directory you've got to give more thought to it than just is there a place where i can scratch the itch that you're supposed to go to church whoo hold to that word it's got to be the word brother brahm says in god of this evil age now this is kind of where we've turned the corner in this and i feel that even through um hungry and i am hungry and not being fed really through those sermons we've been identifying this eating to live we've been wanting just to kind of lay the foundation of the dynamics of hunger and even the mechanics of it and the natural parts to it in order to begin to turn our focus to the fact if i could say this and this is what i've been pondering the fact that god has laid out for us the best spiritual feast there has ever been in any age at any time you name it it's there's never been a better one and so this is the time that we're living in to where we're going to be living way below our privileges if we just kind of approach this as a need to satisfy religion or as a need to kind of promote religion or we're eating for religious purposes and we're not eating for life like this food is life there's rapturing faith in this word there's power to overcome in this word it's just not an escape from the trials of life so i can go and hang out with some believers we have to have some fellowship together and we can hear a good sermon preached about the message and we can see everybody who believes the message then we go right back to the grind but we're showing up and everyone comes and everyone knows i know why you're here i know exactly why you're here uh-huh let's go let's do this we're here to feed we're here to get the word why because life awaits us there's problems to solve there's children to raise there's depth to overcome and we're all coming together because we want to overcome can i tell a story about ritos when i first discovered rito's i am i am the one the first one to discover it it's in my resume i didn't invent ritos i discovered it and i remember having not been a drug addict ever the closest that i could relate to a drug addict is my visits to ritos because you'd have cash in hand and you'd stand outside of a house at 14th and roosevelt and there'd be bars on the windows and doors and you'd be in line with a bunch of other people who have a handful of cash and you're all sitting there kind of going man don't they usually open at 10 and you all kind of look at each other knowingly like i know why you're here you ain't fooling anybody you're not here to get them to sign up for buy some encyclopedias you're here for a burrito and everybody's there for the green chili and that was the only way i could relate i used to think at one point they're putting nicotine in the beans and cracking the burrito because you craved it so much you wanted it so much and this is what happens you ought to have the kind of attitude that when we all show up to church i know why you're here you're not here to be seen and you're not here just to see somebody else you're here because it's life or death you're eating because you need the word you've made the decision to forsake the world you've made the decision to not listen to the nonsense of the lord you've sacrificed friendship and family you've persevered you've stayed the course you've continued in this message in this word not because it was fun playing church but you did it because you knew there was a purpose in it you meet some people and say hey well why don't you why don't you eat this and why don't you eat that i'm allergic to it well come on just try it just eat the shrimp it's not going to kill you're like no that's exactly what it's going to do it's going to kill me and we should should have the kind of attitude like we have an allergy against anything that's not the word and if i eat it it can kill me and have these strict protocols or keep it out keep it out keep it clean why because god has a plan and he's given us the word in this hour to satisfy them and the message god of this evil age and brother bram says and the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that that was right not religion not an altered not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere man strike one strike two strike three strike four strike five not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not even being sincere no none of that's gonna work but by the revelation of the word of god how that we how are we to live how are we to bring a sacrifice how are we come to should we come to church by revelation of the word of god it's got to be the word first it's got to be the word that's the energy in otherwise we're not depleting energy properly we're never going to live spiritually healthy cain brought a sacrifice that was very beautiful from the fruit of the ground and it was something that that would have been an offering to god but it had to be by revelation that was god's requirement and that's the same plan today the word was from the beginning god's plan and not just sincerity not just sacrifice not belonging to church not coming to the altar not religion but you've got to have a revelation of the word of god that's what feeds the soul in matthew chapter 6 he's teaching them how to pray so it's often referred to as the lord's prayer we know it's not the lord's prayer per se but it's the lord teaching us how to pray and let me say this is a powerful prayer may not be very long may be very easy to remember but there's all sorts of mysteries and prophecies and revelations and depth to this prayer we're first acknowledging god and asking that his kingdom come that his will be done and then once we've established this as a basis it comes to what we could say would be the primary need of an individual on a daily basis and and the struggle of human existence and and the the necessity to survive matthew 6 11 give us this day our daily bread and it says give us this day our daily bread and the phrase daily bread it speaks the bread of our necessity the bread we need it is not give us this day our foot long boston cream from claim jumpers it's give us this day our daily bread because bread speaks of all the necessities of life bread speaks of not only all the necessities of life but all that is needed to support life this is what ought to be properly viewed when you say give us this day our daily bread it's speaking of the necessities of life and what you need to support life so this is a request that's saying i have need i don't have what i need i i have this need in my life and what i need the need needs to be met by something that you have and i want you to give it to me it must come by your hand and so there's a necessity of life that needs to be satisfied he says give us this day our it's called our daily bread because we need it and we can't live without it not that we would necessarily have a right to it and some claim on it but we call it our daily bread because we need it and we know that we cannot live without it and if we were to look at this in the sense that give us this day our daily bread speaks to and clearly clearly we could use it to speak to the fact that we ask him to provide by his hand and by his goodness and the opportunities he gives us the the food to place upon our table to feed our bellies and feed our family and to raise our kids and so there's a natural bread and substance that we we acknowledge we turn thanks we say thank you god for this food we give him thanks for all these things for we know it came by his hand and if we took the scripture and said that give us this day our daily bread is a petition for the needs of the body it is unquestionably pointing to a higher need there's no doubt that it's pointing to a higher petition we say oh this is pleading with god to give us bread that it may satisfy natural life but then if that's the case it is actually still yet pointing to a higher request and a higher desire that he would give us what we need to feed our souls in psalms 104 and also psalms 145 verse 15 it's talking about all of creation it's very very beautiful phrase that's used here and and it says the eyes of all that wait upon thee and thou give us them their meat in due season all of you all of all of creation is looking to god to give them what they need to eat and as you read the psalms and you read the the the context of this statement all eyes wait upon thee and thou give us them their meat and due season god gives food that's suited for each beast for each creature for each animal and then he also gives them food not just for each beast and each creature and all animal but for all stages of life for each beast each creature and each animal it's not just feeding sheep but it's also feeding lambs it's not just feeding the mature but it's feeding the babes it's food suited for each animal but also for every area of your life all of creation looks to god to give them and this is the phrase that we hear often spiritual food and due season to give us meat in due season and this scripture is talking about life depending upon food at a proper time in a proper season give us this day our daily bread all eyes look to the you to get their meat in due season it speaks of everything that is living depending upon god to give them food at a proper time and food that is proper in that time and in the right season in order to live give us this day our daily bread is give us give us bread day by day by day by day and brother branham says in the message turn on the light this is this is some good stuff he says so should the church bring forth the bread of each age the bride's got to bring forth the bread of the bright age the church must bring forth the bread of each age that jesus jesus commanded that man shall not live by every word man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god so this is how man ought to live by every word that proceeds from his mouth he says the church should bring forth the bread of each age that's what we're going to live by the bread that is brought forth he says in the rapture message that the shout is the living bread of life bringing forth the bride you see that the bread brings forth the bride the bride feeds on that bread and then the bride lives the substance of that bread and she has bread and life to give to those who need it so the church must bring forth the bread of each age because man has to live by the bread of god and then he says the bread that we need is the bible and not another translation not another interpretation not a different kind of leather not a an elect a an e bible or or some other form of the bible he says it is the complete revelation of god's plan it is the complete revelation of jesus christ so god man tries to get us to some kind of sensible plan something easier something other than what god laid down this bible is what god gave us to feed on you say well just this bible it's prophecies and the fulfillments of it that if the bible speaks of something and it comes to pass and the word is being brought to pass and and the things that pertain to this bible are coming to life then it's giving us food that we have need of in the time that we're living in even this act of coming and hearing the word preached that's the bible in action this is what we live by this is what we must have and this bible it's the complete revelation of god's plan it's the complete revelation of jesus christ and listen we're living in a time when the full word has been made available to the believer he says we add nothing to it or take anything from it if you do what happens it's not going to give you it's not going to give you the strength you need you're going to create the wrong kind of appetite whosoever does his name shall be taken on the book of life we don't need any creeds to add to this this message this bible became a new book when the word was opened so this bible is god's plan this word is god's plan this word is god's nutritional plan for the believer this word is god is the bride's feast you want to call it a diet that's fine but sometimes it scares us who like to eat it's the bride's feast this message is the bread of this day day by day it's our fresh manna as god poured out manna from heaven every day fresh in the morning upon the dew and this was bread that they ate in the exodus that's clearly a type how that there was bread that came every morning and it fed them in the exes that's the type how that god will give us the bread that we need day by day by day by day from the word of god let me let me just read a few scriptures that we read last time laodicea is ending in chaos descending into chaos in the preview of the bride here they go just falling right down into chaos and as their the church world is going down into chaos there's a different procession taking place and the bride is sending up and so the the announcement in revelations chapter 4 is to the bride to come up higher it's connected with this voice in revelations 3 20. so as the world is in chaos and they're in there they're sick and they're unhealthy and they don't think they need to change god gives us the the diagnosis and then he gives a prescription for this laodicean condition it's christ who stands at the door knocking and he says if you'll hear his voice that's what you've got to hear not the knocking you've got to hear his voice there elijah in the cave and what happened the lord passed by and there was an earthquake there was wind and there was fire but what what what did the scripture teach us god wasn't in those though that were it was evidence of his presence and there was something that was taking place earthquake he caused an earthquake he causes fire he causes wind so here elijah recognizes something is happening this seems significant there's a lot of commotion but god wasn't in those three things he's not in the knocking it was in the still small voice that's where eliza elijah heard the voice of god and that's what he was waiting to hear because that's the only thing that could motivate and satisfy not just a bunch of commotion and lots of fire lots of wind a lot of earthquake a lot of shaking i need to hear the voice that's what's going to feed me that's what's going to inspire me that's what's going to get me going behold i stand at the door knock if any man hear my voice and open the door and this is what takes place i will come into him at that day it's i in you and you and me i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me god's answer to the dark laodicean condition the most ridiculous age the age that has rejected jesus christ he's a fugitive in his own church what's his how do we how do we solve this do we fix lao to see it no let's just come out of it and he calls the bride to a spiritual feast he types the answer the answer we have and let me say it this way so the point is made the answer to whatever condition that laodicea wants to put on you the answer to whatever battle whatever fight and whatever enigma you may be facing as a result of the laodicean condition that we see around us the answer is feasting with him the answer is christ the answer is interacting with the word the answer is approaching the word the right way and getting out of the word what you need to defend against all the nonsense that's in the world and to get the energy you need to fly above all the nonsense of the world that's in the word the suffering that it refers to here i will come into him and sup with him and you will sup with him there's a spiritual feast then that this message invites you to before the wedding supper in the sky you're eating here first there's a feast that's taking place here there's a spiritual feast here and it's actually the feeding here and the things you get here that's going to translate you to go to the wedding supper in the sky so listen don't hold back now say no i'm i'm saving myself for the wedding supper you ain't going to get there eat up roll up your sleeves put a spiritual bib on don't worry if it gets messy eat eat eat fill yourself with this because if you don't you won't make it there you know sometimes people make a big mistake this is just my opinion you've heard the beep there's a disclaimer that's scrolling across the bottom they say oh we're gonna go over to so-and-so's house or thanksgiving and what do you do you starve yourself for a couple days leading up to thanksgiving you're never gonna be able to eat as much as you want if you starve yourself your stomach shrinks you lose your appetite and so you're actually in a good spot to eat healthy on thanksgiving right because you finally shrunk it down you haven't been eating anything and you eat and you get full real fast oh man i'm surprised i got so full so fast you know what you need to do you need to pre-gain for 72 hours you need to be drinking a lot of water eat a lot of foods to fill that belly up get it really distended you know make sure you're in a position that by the time you get to eat you've got a belly that's really big but empty and you can eat as much as you want we ought to be spiritual confetti competitive food eaters in a sense he was like hey god's given me seven seals give me a law oh i'm just gonna enjoy the second seal in the second seal so good i think that's enough i've had enough get in there eat it there's a feast that's poured out before you and you better be eaten here you'll never get there and what is it that takes place is it it this is the the door that opens up there's a spiritual uh john is called up high in revelations 4 and then we see this beautiful scene which is prophet prophecy to the gentiles in revelation chapter 10. and in revelations chapter 10 the mighty angel comes down with the book that was sealed in revelations 5. it's now open in revelations 10. and in the breach brother branham before the seals are preached and before they're fully coming open as he expresses them he's using the breach in revelations chapter 10 is the context for these seals becoming open and he's probing with different things and he's adding these things in there but he's definitely facing this reality that these mysteries are opened up and they're given to the seventh angel to give to the people and the seventh angel is on earth at the time that the mighty angel comes down out of heaven with the book open and then this mighty angel comes down and gives this book to the seventh angel and this is what's literally happened in our day the revelation that came to the messenger is now given out to the bride and the bride now has opportunity to feast on the same revelation and to be spiritually eaten in these things so in the days of the voice when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god is finished and then what takes place is now i hear another voice that tells me to go to the angel and ask for the book and in verse 9 so i go to the angel and i tell him give me the little book but now that you have opened the door and he has come into you and you to him now he will sup with you or feast with you or eat with you so it's not just give me the book and we're all going to sit around and talk about the book and talk about the message he says no now this is christ with the further revelation take the book and eat it up eat it up eat it all every bit of it this message brings us to a spiritual feast with christ now just to wrap up and finish up this eating to live part i think i've said enough there and that segment to for you to understand what it is i i'm burdened with we have a message that we should be feeding on we have truths that have been brought to pass in this hour that we can feed on take the book eat it up then he says he takes the book and he says listen when you eat it this is what's going to happen so john takes it eats it is exactly what happens so now the in the process of eating the book and when you take something and you eat it your body processes it and and so there's certain ways that it impacts you uh there's you know they there's a thought and there's even even some science behind it that if you if you eat the toenail of a pig it's going to strengthen your toenails right grind it up in powder put in your jello oh they do that with the thyroid of a pig you take a thyroid pill and it's supposed to strengthen your thyroid you can eat bone broth and what's it supposed to do strengthen your bones you eat the skin of chicken it's supposed to make your skin glowing that's why we all have glowing skin in here because we do skin on chicken and what they're saying is this that the one feeds the other and strengthens the other and so your body processes it and then it distributes the nutrients and the strength and the and and the health to those parts of the body now if you just take that say that's that's some symbol or some analogy or some type now think then what this word is supposed to do it is going to materialize the word body around you it's going to produce the word in your life and so it says in revelation chapter 10 verse 11 after he's taken the book and eaten it there's a consequence for eating this book there's a process that takes place when you eat it verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings thou must prophesy again this is not just you eating and and enjoyed it and sitting back wow that was really good but this is you now declaring the contents of the book this is you now living out in flesh the contents of that book you receive a revelation in secret you are feasting seemingly in secret but then your life becomes the public distribution and manifestation of all the health and all the life and all the nutrients of what was in that book we must manifest and prophesy again brother brown says the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour give us this day our daily bread if you're eating your bread for this day then you become the reflection of this day's bread you're a reflection of this hour the message reflection of it he says you live again you live the life that was in jesus christ what is prophesy again live again you live again you live this word again however it looked that in the days of christ as the word was being made flesh then we live it again now this is a statement familiar with us god's intention for his creation man is to express his word so god intends us to express his words now how are you going to express his word unless you're eating his word how are you going to express it unless you're eating it john was not told to prophesy again and then when you get hungry go eat the book he had to eat it first before he could live it he had to eat it first before he could speak it the word itself made flesh in him you your reflection of this hour you live again so god's intention for creation is to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by the word to live by it's like bread this is what i live by this is substance this is strength this is life he says a life lived by the word would be the word expressed i think there's a phrase you are what you eat well this is how we could use it in this context i'm eating the word therefore i am the word expressed i'm eating the book therefore i am the book expressed i'm eating christ therefore i am christ expressed oh you're pulling me right into just the whole vast uh uh array of what god says in the word of god why is it that we are becoming one body because we're all eating one bread how can we become one body and have one voice if we're not all eating of the same body word and feed it on christ and it's been assimilated in our character and we become this marching army life lived by the word would be the word expressed in other words eating to live bill abraham says in the laodicean church age there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living that word what did we read earlier about how brother branham said it's not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but a revelation of the word of god he says your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to god none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne it will be granted only to the word bride so i have not i am not approaching church i'm not approaching prayer i'm not approaching fasting i'm not approaching repentances i'm not reproaching approaching any of these other things so that it'll somehow earn me the opportunity to sit in the throne but i'm doing it because that's my destiny i'm doing it because it's where i know that god is leading me i'm doing it because i know that this is what god has for me i'm eating these things because these things are going to be leading me somewhere i'm eating these things because i know that god has a that i'm part of a process i'm part of a plan there's something that's taking place in my life i've got to be feeding on this and i'm feeding on this because not because i want to become the word bride but because i am the word of right word bride i'm feeding on the word of god i was fellowshipping with a real dear friend of mine his father passed away a couple years ago and and then another friend a close family friend had passed away and were fellowshipping this past week and he's just in a transition time in his life and i could tell he was really really heavy and after being on the phone with them for a while i kind of felt like man i just got off the phone and i was encouraged but i felt like i didn't really have much uh to say to him i in the phone call and just something overwhelming i wanted to express it to him and i just and i i reached out to him and i told him i said you know not everything you're experiencing in going through is because of loss and because of the uncertainty of life not everything you're going through is because you've lost something not everything you're going through is because of the uncertainties of the the age that we're living in but oftentimes we feel empty or we feel hungry feel lonely because what our destiny is i don't feel this way because i'm really going through it i don't feel this way because because i've lost something i don't feel this way because something's wrong i feel this way because what i'm called to i feel this way because of my destiny and i if i didn't feel this way then i i wouldn't be coming to it i feel this way because i'm going to come to it i feel this way because i know that this word is go is mine it's my right i feel this way to eat this way because i know the throne is mine i'm eating because yes there's a longing there's an emptiness and there's a desire but not because of loss not because of sin not because of some mistake but because of what i'm called to that's why i'm hungry so it will not be granted to those who are doing a bunch of things that are religious but it will be granted to those that are living the word and if you're going to be living the words you've got to be eating the word it'll be granted to the word bride brother branham says in the message perfect faith you become the word as you receive the word how we the word bride how are the word by nodding and saying yes to the word no no by receiving the word we become the word bride we become the word bride because we receive the word and in taking that word we're becoming the manifestation of that word but mike if you could come i'd like to close you become the word as you receive the word bill branham in the church age book chapter five when he's writing out what god spoke was speaking or if this phrase here rather is him uh expressing what god is saying to the age i am the word this is god speaking if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word if you want the word then welcome and receive it if you want god in your home you want god in your life you want god in your situation then welcome and receive him into it make can welcome if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word this is not receiving a picture of the hoffman's head of christ this is not receiving a rosary this is not doing any kind of religion this is welcoming and receiving the word you want deity in your midst then receive the word you become the word as you receive the word the throne is only gonna be granted to a word bride only granted to those who are living the word a life lived by the word would be the word express here's the process receive the word receive the word receive the word be the word live the word become the word so if you want the word you want god in your midst then welcome and receive the word and then he says don't ever this is god speaking don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which i am giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that i am the word remember that and then listen to this statement i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst something could take place and we could say impressive so an opportunity can be presented to us like well that's i'm impressed and there's a lot of things that we could respond to and say yeah that left an impression i was impressed but brother brown does not just say i wonder if we're impressed by the message there's a lot of people that are impressed with it a lot of people but the message has a purpose so it's not just merely are you impressed with it are you sufficiently impressed and i believe that we must have the attitude to where we say god sufficiently impress me press yourself lord i welcome and receive the word that it may be pressed into me that i might become one with it i want to be sufficiently impressed i don't want to just be impressed with its vindications impressed with its doctrines impressed with certain things about it i want to be sufficiently impressed in other words i want the word to be so welcomed and received to where it fulfills its purpose in my life sufficiently impressed enough to meet its purpose enough to do what it's supposed to do and and to welcome and receive it so that he is not just acknowledged but he's he has preeminence this is what i mean by eating to live that when i sit down to eat i'm sufficiently impressed with the opportunity i have before me i'm sufficiently impressed that my coming to church is not just another opportunity to say i've gone to church but it's an opportunity to feast at his table when i pray it's an opportunity to for a face-to-face conversation with god when i read my bible i'm looking him face to face when i listen to the voice of go listen to the message of the hour i'm hearing god's messenger i'm hearing the voice of god coming through to me and i i'm recalibrating my expectations i'm recalibrating my assessments and my judgments i'm rearranging my balance sheet to get it back in order to realize no these things are valuable these things are important lord let me be sufficiently impressed with your word for now i'm not just doing it because of religion i'm not just doing it in the sense because i need i i want to feel a certain way and i want to uh i'm not just driven by religious duty i'm not just driven by what is required of a message believer but i'm driven for life i'm sufficiently impressed to say give me this day my daily bread this isn't a supplement let me just say this if you're getting what you need you wouldn't need to supplement this message has it this message has what we need well brother aaron should we read anything outside of it i'm not saying that if you're eating it's going to give you the right kind of appetite to get what you need out of other things some people don't realize they're starving and that's why they're supplementing they're not doing it because they're healthy they're doing it because they're unhealthy let it not be said of us that we're just reaching out craving trying to find something that'll satisfy something to give us faith something to encourage us because we've lost our spiritual receptors and we're trying to find something to satisfy and placate this hunger let's start eating healthy and break the wrong kind of cravings find the right kind of table to sit at begin to feed upon the pure word of god again feed on it as we feed on it then we start to get the right kind of nutrients we need from the meals that we're taking and i don't need a supplement i'm getting all the vitamins i need from the word of god god bless you let's stand let's take the word brother bram says feel your heart and mouth with him let's do that let's purpose in our hearts as a church to listen to more of in our own personal devotion to listen to the message of the hour to talk about it when we're with one another to spiritually feast on the right things and then personally fellowship around these things to promote the presence of christ to promote healing so that we can live live the live the right kind of life so that we can be living the word it's not my desire to to express that so that we can become a better church so that you individually can live a life closer to god that's what's important the closer you walk with god the more you overcome monday monday to saturday the more that you're in fellowship is what's going to make church even better it doesn't make we don't need to get a better church to make you better you just need to be fed and spiritually healthy and alive and that's what's going to make things better that's our desire gracious heavenly father tonight as we close this service we thank you for the opportunity we've had to be here we thank you lord for the sacrifices that are made to provide this facility we thank you lord that we were able to have this service despite the pressures and things that were pushing in against us but i'm very proud of this congregation all the members of it that support and pray and communicate and do all the things that they're doing as we fellowship together and are making great sacrifices lord to produc conduct ourselves in a church service in a setting that's not customary or not typical [Music] but i believe it speaks to a desire in the people's hearts to fellowship around the right things to be in your presence and to feast at your table a lord of sacrifices have been made not only to stream and to hear the word over the internet but lord to be here present now and to hear it i ask that you would touch the hearts of those who've heard [Music] for that one who prayed today it had a long season of prayer before they came here and said lord i'm coming to church tonight because i need something and they asked for you to come and meet their need may you now father give them the healing they asked for give them the relief that they desired give them the meat that meets their need tonight or they did exactly what your prophet said to do they were in a season of prayer they put themselves aside they prayed they came expecting they came with the right attitude and lord now may they leave here having received what they had need of may they go to getting healed as your prophet said lord for a lot of us it's probably a chaotic evening but you saw our hearts lord we finally say enough and push the chaos aside so that we can come and hear from you lord i pray now despite the chaos of the afternoon and even the things that were just pressing on us as we walked in the door lord we heard you our spirit said amen to you we ask now for a special touch let your firefall let your presence move strengthen and encourage forgive and set free give us that freshness in our spirits we long to have lord bless your people be with us now we pray in jesus name amen
