[0:00] going to continue on the big three I
[0:02] think I missed a real good opportunity
[0:04] to only have three parts on the big
[0:05] three but we're going to push it a
[0:06] little bit further and keep going as
[0:08] we've tried to make this connection over
[0:10] the last couple services on The Big
[0:13] Three As We introduced it before and
[0:15] we'll touch on it here in a minute uh
[0:16] make that connection with money women
[0:18] and popularity as brother brandham uh
[0:21] brought those things out it admonished
[0:23] ministers about these traps and these
[0:25] things that'll get a minister off the
[0:27] Beaten Track uh We've we've been making
[0:29] this association with the big three and
[0:32] just feel to spend some time on each one
[0:34] maybe not a lot of time but look at the
[0:36] aspects of money women and popularity
[0:38] brother brandham in The Harvest Time
[0:40] talks about the three Temptations of
[0:42] Christ the three Temptations of a
[0:44] minister the three Temptations of the
[0:46] church three Temptations of an
[0:47] organization and he brings it down he
[0:49] says three Temptations of the individual
[0:52] and he says where they make their fall
[0:53] or where they fail so these three
[0:55] Temptations and however you'd want to
[0:57] change the wording or divide it up we
[1:00] know that in 1 John 2:16 it says all
[1:02] that is in the world is the lust of the
[1:04] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:06] of life these things in the world that
[1:08] are not of the father uh because the
[1:10] good things come from God every good and
[1:12] perfect gift comes from God so those
[1:14] things that we see that are lustful that
[1:16] are desirous that are contrary to the
[1:18] word of God Timothy or John just lumps
[1:21] them all into one group and says you can
[1:23] find them in one of these three headings
[1:24] or categories and there's always an
[1:27] overlap there's maybe a VIN diagram that
[1:29] we could do with different circles and
[1:30] find where they all three meet but the
[1:32] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:34] and the pride of life are something that
[1:36] all of us battle believe even from the
[1:38] youngest to the oldest no matter how old
[1:40] you are in some ways uh you're learning
[1:43] uh what it means to wrestle with the
[1:44] lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh
[1:46] and the pride of life John in writing in
[1:49] first John he's saying I write unto you
[1:51] children because your sins are forgiven
[1:53] and he writes under the young men
[1:54] because the word of God abideth in you
[1:56] and you've overcome the wicked one I
[1:58] write unto you adults because uh you've
[2:00] known him from the beginning so there's
[2:02] this continuity of these challenges that
[2:05] we all face to every time of life every
[2:07] season of life and I believe there's a
[2:09] word for everyone there's a word for
[2:12] everyone to encourage them wherever they
[2:13] are Jude verse 11 it says woe unto them
[2:17] for they have gone in the way of Cain
[2:19] and ran greedily after the heir of balum
[2:22] forward and perished in the gain saying
[2:25] of Kora I want to just get into our
[2:28] thought we we some pick up a little bit
[2:30] review from Sunday but I just want to
[2:32] get into this these are three different
[2:35] Temptations you could say you have a way
[2:37] you have an error you have a gain say
[2:40] but in describing this these particular
[2:42] group of people and Peter even touches
[2:45] on them in very similar language they
[2:47] have gone in the way of Cain ran
[2:50] greedily after the heir of balum for
[2:51] reward and perished in the gains of Kor
[2:56] we could say that it reads that they've
[2:58] done all three we could also say say if
[3:00] you just did one that's enough we know
[3:02] that in baseball uh one out of three is
[3:04] a Hall of Fame and the same would go for
[3:07] being evil if you got one out of these
[3:08] three you're not doing good so it's the
[3:11] way of Cain Run the heir of balum and
[3:13] the gain Sayan of Kora as we may have
[3:17] opportunity in the future the way of
[3:19] Cain represents the lust of the eye it
[3:22] is satisfying conscience or desire
[3:25] something your eyes sees and you covet
[3:27] after it Genesis 4 4:3 it says and in
[3:31] the process of time it came to pass that
[3:33] Cain brought the fruit of the ground an
[3:36] offering unto the Lord I've read a lot
[3:39] of different studies on this and how
[3:41] some commentators look at it and
[3:43] traditionally how some people view it
[3:45] and they look at this and they are
[3:47] immediately uh I don't I guess I
[3:50] wouldn't say defensive of Cain but they
[3:52] see the good in it and they say well
[3:54] this offering uh is not necessarily
[3:57] wrong because you have a meal offering
[3:59] and the word are similar to that which
[4:00] is required in Leviticus and and so what
[4:03] Cain was doing is it seems natural that
[4:06] the first fruits of the ground would be
[4:08] offered just as the same as the first
[4:09] fruits of the flock would be offered and
[4:12] and so he's offering this there's
[4:14] nothing wrong with the offering in
[4:16] itself and and they wrestle uh maybe not
[4:19] wrestle but they just interpret the fact
[4:21] that he worshiped as being that's fine
[4:23] everything okay there was nothing wrong
[4:24] with what he did one particular
[4:26] commentator drilled down on some of the
[4:29] words that are used on the fruit of the
[4:30] ground and offering un the Lord and and
[4:33] suggested that he probably just offered
[4:35] up the least of what he had the
[4:38] leftovers of flax and hemp seeds and uh
[4:42] and that's what he that's what he
[4:43] offered up anymore I guess flax and hemp
[4:46] are some of the most desirable things so
[4:48] uh jokes on you commentator but they say
[4:51] that he was just offering his leftovers
[4:53] but we're informed by the message of the
[4:55] hour that tells us that Cain made a
[4:57] beautiful offering that he looked out
[5:00] after it in such a way to where it would
[5:01] have been pleasing and it would have
[5:04] been uh it would have been a beautiful
[5:06] attractive way of worship and so Cain's
[5:09] offering and I'm just touching on this
[5:11] very quickly and drawing from what
[5:13] brother bam taught which I know you all
[5:15] know very well that Cain's offering was
[5:17] driven by the eye that he was looking at
[5:20] the Optics I want this to look good and
[5:23] whether he was motivated to worship
[5:25] first by Cain uh by Abel's Revelation in
[5:28] seeing that Abel offering so Cain
[5:31] thought I could do better and I can make
[5:32] it look better smell better sound better
[5:34] and be a little bit more visually
[5:35] pleasing whatever it was he was it was
[5:38] pretense and it was Optics that drove
[5:41] him to worship we realize that his
[5:43] worship is a false religion it's even
[5:46] associated with a dead religion or an
[5:48] impersonation and the offering that Cain
[5:51] brought though beautiful failed to
[5:53] please God in Hebrews 11:4 it says by
[5:56] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[5:59] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[6:03] Abel's offering by faith he obtained
[6:06] witness that he was righteous God
[6:08] testifying of his gifts and by it he
[6:10] being dead yet speaketh Abel pleased God
[6:14] by faith not by sight whereas Cain
[6:17] thought that if he could uh visually
[6:19] represent it in a certain way it would
[6:21] be accepted if he thought maybe again
[6:23] the pretense the Optics the way things
[6:25] look and feel the lust of the eyes to
[6:27] maybe even make it pleasing to himself
[6:30] and brother Brandon makes a statement in
[6:32] one place that Cain uh did it the fruit
[6:34] of the ground and he says as he was
[6:36] taught and the garden by his parrots
[6:39] maybe missing the paraphrase a little
[6:40] bit there but He suggests that maybe
[6:42] Cain is offering the fruit of the ground
[6:44] because in the telling of what happened
[6:46] is it was the allegory of a fruit the
[6:49] fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good
[6:50] and Evil is the reason why we fail and
[6:52] Cain goes right back to fruit fruit of
[6:55] the ground it goes right back to things
[6:56] from the earth that fig Leaf religion
[6:59] the offering of fruit things from the
[7:00] ground that has been cursed and that's
[7:02] what he offers unto God and it was a
[7:05] offering by sight not by revelation of
[7:08] faith that Abel had so it's the way of
[7:11] Cain is that lust of the eye it's
[7:15] something that we could look at our own
[7:17] lives by and examine ourselves to see
[7:19] whether or not we wrestle in these
[7:21] things and woe unto them for they have
[7:24] gone in the perished in the gain saying
[7:29] of of Kora I would associate this with
[7:32] the pride of life this Lust For
[7:34] popularity this desire for status as it
[7:37] says in Numbers chapter 16 veres 1 2 and
[7:40] three now Kora the son of isar the son
[7:42] of kth the son of Levi and Dayan and
[7:45] Abram and the sons of elab and on the
[7:47] son of pth the son of Reuben took men
[7:50] and so now here's the the the gain say
[7:53] of core and they rose up before Moses
[7:55] with Now Catch the language with certain
[7:58] of the children of Israel just weren
[8:01] having anybody go you had to have the
[8:04] right kind of income right the right
[8:06] kind of uh testimony 250 princes of the
[8:12] assembly famous in the congregation I
[8:15] saw here this week that Famous Amos died
[8:19] uh moment of silence God bless him he's
[8:21] the one that invented the Famous Amos
[8:23] cookies and got his recipe from a family
[8:25] recipe but anyways it's not Famous Amos
[8:28] Famous in the congregation men of renown
[8:31] so this is a pretty Elite group this is
[8:33] premium this is as they might say today
[8:35] premium Ministry that they got together
[8:38] and rallied them to the elite eight they
[8:40] got the greats together and they said we
[8:43] got certain children of Israel princes
[8:45] of the assembly famous in the
[8:47] congregation men of renown and they
[8:50] gathered together to do what gathered
[8:52] themselves together against the prophet
[8:56] against the message of the hour against
[8:58] Moses and against Aaron and said unto
[9:00] them ye take too much upon you seeing
[9:04] all the congregation Are Holy every one
[9:06] of them and the Lord is among them
[9:07] wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
[9:09] above the congregation of the lord it's
[9:12] called a gain saan of core because it's
[9:14] not true made false accusations and lied
[9:18] and didn't tell the truth about Moses
[9:20] and even the arrangement but at the end
[9:21] of the day if you look at the story of
[9:23] Kora he was just mad that he wasn't
[9:26] doing it they were mad as princes of the
[9:28] congregation and Men of renown and
[9:30] famous that they hadn't been selected
[9:32] among the Levites to serve in the
[9:34] priesthood and felt like they should
[9:36] have a right just like Moses and Aaron
[9:39] and his sons did so it was this Lust For
[9:42] position and in doing so it causes them
[9:44] to gains say against the prophet and
[9:47] they built consensus by having well this
[9:49] is a big name and this is a good guy and
[9:50] this guy's famous and they they use that
[9:53] it's the pride of life to actually come
[9:55] against the word of
[9:57] God now let's take the remainder of our
[10:00] evening together as we have opportunity
[10:02] to look at the eror of balum again I say
[10:05] that the ER of balum is rooted in the
[10:07] lust of the flesh this was that
[10:09] wandering the air the Wonder to be led
[10:12] astray which led to lust lust is excited
[10:15] and then when it's entertained and and
[10:17] someone is enticed then it bringeth
[10:19] forth sin and then let sin finish its
[10:21] course it brings forth death as we used
[10:24] balum as an example on Sunday and we
[10:26] looked at his ministry just those few
[10:28] chapters that tell us about about it on
[10:30] its face it appears as if balum is
[10:33] resisting the bribes of
[10:35] Balo and it looks like balam's doing a
[10:38] really good job because he seems sincere
[10:40] and he's regarded as a prophet and and
[10:42] Balo says there's this group that's come
[10:44] up out of Egypt I need you to help me I
[10:46] need you to curse them because I'm
[10:47] afraid they're too great for me a and
[10:49] and balum goes before the Lord and the
[10:52] Lord says don't go with them and I can't
[10:55] curse them but bam goes back to Bao and
[10:58] says the Lord told me not to go with you
[11:00] and he says hey I'll give you something
[11:02] I'll give you money I'll give you houses
[11:04] I'll give you lands I'll give you things
[11:05] you want and he says well let me just go
[11:07] see what God would say and he already
[11:10] knows what God was going to say but he
[11:12] goes back and the Lord says I tell you
[11:13] what if the princes come back to you and
[11:16] ask you to go go with them but you have
[11:18] to say what I say and in the morning
[11:20] what did Bam do got up didn't even wait
[11:22] for someone to ask went his way and God
[11:25] stopped him and the Bible says that this
[11:27] was iniquity in bam God was rebuking him
[11:30] through speaking through his donkey and
[11:32] we're reading it and you're thinking
[11:34] wait what did I miss and you realize
[11:36] that balum had been showing or at least
[11:39] forecasting that he was wanting to hang
[11:41] close to this opportunity so he didn't
[11:43] completely miss it in case he got a
[11:45] chance at it and so God knew that this
[11:48] was in his heart and when the story
[11:50] finishes it looks like they both just go
[11:52] their ways but in the very next chapter
[11:54] numbers 25 and I'm just reviewing this
[11:56] for you but uh I've got a I got a an to
[12:00] fill there's a uh the next thing we know
[12:04] that the sons of Israel are committing
[12:06] whoredom in fornicating with the
[12:08] daughters of Moab and the Bible then
[12:10] tells us that they did it at the Council
[12:13] of balum Revelation says that it was the
[12:16] doctrine of balam who taught Balo to
[12:18] cast a stumbling block before the
[12:20] children of Israel so Revelations 2:14
[12:23] the doctrine of bam was to teach the
[12:25] adversary teach the enemy how to cast a
[12:28] St stumbling block before the elect to
[12:31] eat things sacrificed unto idols and
[12:33] then to commit fornication so the
[12:36] stumbling block of the lust of the flesh
[12:38] leads to fulfilling the lust of the eyes
[12:41] or the eating the then the fornicating
[12:43] and if I could say this the L cannot be
[12:46] cursed the Born Again cannot be cursed
[12:48] the bride cannot be cursed but Satan so
[12:51] only the only thing Satan can do is
[12:52] tempt her to
[12:53] stumble tempt her to get out of Step
[12:59] Le deene Church
[13:01] age descended into
[13:03] chaos tongues and tinkling and dancing
[13:06] and shouting and all sorts of stuff
[13:08] descending Into Darkness and chaos and
[13:10] the bride dressed holy marching to
[13:12] Onward Christian Soldiers sober uh
[13:15] filled with the Holy Ghost holy but a
[13:17] few of them at the back begin to get
[13:19] their eyes on that wild and crazy
[13:22] blackened out Church going descending
[13:24] into chaos and they got their eyes on it
[13:26] and got out of Step a little bit he came
[13:29] can't keep you from ascending but he can
[13:30] make you get out of Step can't curse you
[13:33] but he can tempt you to stumble the
[13:36] Bible says that these women caused the
[13:39] children of Israel through the Council
[13:41] of balum to commit trespass against the
[13:43] Lord in the matter of p peor and the
[13:46] plague was amongst the congregation of
[13:48] Israel because of the congregation of
[13:50] the Lord because of this Council of
[13:54] balum he taught Bao how to get the
[13:57] people of Israel to fall through the
[13:58] lust of the flesh and the lust of the
[14:00] eyes first through enticing them through
[14:03] sweet meats and offering a discount an
[14:05] opportunity just may seem real simple
[14:07] and real humble that's why the Bible
[14:09] counsels Us in certain situations not to
[14:12] do certain things and to be careful what
[14:14] ground you get on and the word of God is
[14:16] is asking us to use some discernment and
[14:19] wisdom because Satan has a plan he has a
[14:21] scheme of trying to entice
[14:23] us and and what balum does it's really
[14:27] it was nothing new but he dim
[14:29] demonstrate Satan's tactics from the
[14:31] beginning in other words when bam begin
[14:33] to counsel Balo he knew enough and he
[14:36] knew how to get Israel to bring God's
[14:38] Wrath down every time balam opens his
[14:41] mouth Israel's cursed so he realizes I
[14:44] can't curse them but maybe I can cause
[14:46] them to essentially curse themselves
[14:49] bring God's Wrath and judgment cause
[14:51] many to perish and so he knew how to get
[14:53] Israel to
[14:55] stumble in the sermon the
[14:57] contest brother bam says and now the
[14:59] enemy is going to study our strategy
[15:02] with the word so he's
[15:04] watching he's he's using the table app
[15:07] just as much as we are he's listening
[15:10] he's hearing he's he's pulling quotes
[15:12] he's running search strings he's
[15:14] studying these things and now Satan
[15:16] studied that all out so perfectly till
[15:18] when he come to Eve he had the best
[15:21] strategy he could use upon her and that
[15:23] was to reason with God's word now I
[15:26] would like you to think about how that
[15:28] Satan studied temperament Stan Satan
[15:30] studies the individual Satan has been
[15:33] not only studying human nature but
[15:34] designing it a and sewing things into it
[15:38] and laying traps and snares so Satan is
[15:40] an expert on human behavior he's an
[15:42] expert on uh economic behavior he's an
[15:45] expert on hertica and why we act the way
[15:49] that we do and how we make decisions and
[15:51] he's been doing a good job in many ways
[15:52] of programming us for quite some time so
[15:55] Satan studied it out so perfectly till
[15:57] he knew the right kind of strategy to
[15:59] use on the woman that was to cause her
[16:01] to reason with the word and I would
[16:03] argue that balam's approach was not any
[16:05] different that he had studied enough
[16:07] knew enough and had strategized enough
[16:09] to where he would technically not open
[16:11] his mouth to curse Israel but he found a
[16:14] way to get the money from Bao and teach
[16:17] Bao how to cause Israel to stumble
[16:19] because of all the knowledge that he had
[16:22] and I do not believe that anyone needs
[16:23] to necessarily wake up in the morning
[16:26] and choose to put on the balum hat and
[16:28] and sell their soul out out and sell out
[16:29] for money and do this and do that but
[16:31] there is a spirit that is also subtle to
[16:33] the point to where balam actually
[16:34] thought he might have been doing the
[16:36] right
[16:38] thing there's many Jews that postulate
[16:41] and I think it may even be Josephus if
[16:43] I'm wrong please forgive me Josephus who
[16:45] said that Judas believed that Christ was
[16:47] the Messiah thought he saw an
[16:49] opportunity to make a little Gus right
[16:53] because after all he's the
[16:54] Messiah and if they try to come and take
[16:57] him he's going to over throw him and
[16:59] he's going to beat them and they one
[17:00] even says that Judas was doing this as a
[17:02] way to provoke the Messiah to step up
[17:04] into his Royal office to step in and
[17:07] overthrow the oppressors but it was the
[17:08] money at the end of the day that he was
[17:10] after and concerned
[17:12] about and so AB balum isn't necessarily
[17:15] somebody who uh is
[17:19] intentionally trying to destroy God's
[17:21] word but acts by the wrong incentive to
[17:24] cause Believers to
[17:26] stumble or ourselves
[17:30] tempted so he demonstrates Satan's
[17:32] tactic continuing now you never want to
[17:35] reason with God's word just believe
[17:38] it God's word just believe it don't try
[17:40] to explain it don't try to figure it out
[17:44] now you cannot figure out God so God is
[17:46] the word and it's just made to believe
[17:48] and that's our strength just accept the
[17:51] word anyone knows that that a seed in
[17:54] the right kind of ground will produce
[17:55] its kind and we just take the word
[18:00] if our strength is to accept the word
[18:03] Delilah wants to change
[18:05] it Delilah would want to add to it she
[18:09] can't cut our hair but if we could take
[18:11] our strength and put pluses on it and
[18:13] mix it and defile it then our strength
[18:15] can be gone so we got to stay with the
[18:18] word of God just take the word Israel
[18:21] stumbled through the lust of the Flesh
[18:23] and the lust of the Eyes by the Council
[18:25] of balum we can say Israel stumbled
[18:29] through the those sweet meats and then
[18:31] delay with these women and the
[18:32] fornication we can say the lust of the
[18:34] Flesh and the lust of the eyes but on
[18:35] balam's part his weakness was
[18:39] money 2 Peter 2:15 it says which have
[18:42] forsaken the right way and are gone
[18:44] astray following the way of balam the
[18:46] son of basor who loved the wages of
[18:51] unrighteousness money controlled
[18:53] balum and if money controlled balum
[18:56] balum used money to control
[18:59] that's the danger that's the the running
[19:01] greedily after the heir of balam for
[19:03] reward that's the caution to us is that
[19:05] we cannot be controlled by money nor
[19:08] should we use money to
[19:11] control we read this statement on Sunday
[19:13] money was the prophet balum who sold out
[19:16] his gifts to go on the account of money
[19:19] when Balo offered so much
[19:22] money he was greedy for
[19:25] reward we I could say this that the he
[19:28] of balum was all he was concerned about
[19:30] was the
[19:32] paycheck he thought well I I just need a
[19:35] paycheck a man's got to work to eat so I
[19:37] I I I got to work and I want to get uh
[19:40] money and I want to provide for my house
[19:42] and Bible says a man doesn't provide for
[19:43] his own he's worse than an Infidel so
[19:45] there's a way that you could rationalize
[19:47] into making the paycheck have
[19:49] preeminence rationalize into money and
[19:51] getting ahead and finances and things
[19:53] just to become this Albatross and this
[19:55] weight and this burden that's upon us
[19:57] because we run greedily after the wages
[19:59] we run greedily after the salary we run
[20:01] greedily after the things of the world
[20:04] and there's a way that this money
[20:05] becomes a problem because if all you
[20:07] want is money not worried about
[20:08] testimony character uh uh sleeping well
[20:11] at night and things like that uh there's
[20:13] a you begin to cut Corners you begin to
[20:16] lie and cheat there's a lot of ways that
[20:18] this problem with money that's not just
[20:20] a preacher's problem can get all of us
[20:23] we covered a lot of this in Parts one
[20:25] and two on a mortgaged home earlier this
[20:28] year and so I would just make reference
[20:30] to that and say that we've covered this
[20:32] a lot we've touched on this a lot and I
[20:33] believe it Bears repeating though I
[20:35] don't I'm just going to repeat maybe a
[20:37] few things as we go forward but in
[20:39] Proverbs 15:
[20:41] 27 says he that is greedy of gain
[20:44] troubleth his own house but he that
[20:47] hateth gifts shall live I remember this
[20:50] very well it's like ouch I you I got to
[20:52] hate gifts
[20:58] but that one that's eager to be rich
[21:01] desirous of
[21:02] wealth puts a lot of stock in having
[21:04] material possessions he troubles his
[21:07] household even though he may be
[21:09] acquiring possessions and getting rich
[21:11] and accumulating wealth it says it's a
[21:14] it's a trouble to his house and then it
[21:16] says but he that hateth gifts shall live
[21:19] I don't want to just I don't want to
[21:21] just live in a sleep in a house I don't
[21:23] just want to breathe uh in Nice Clothing
[21:26] I I want to live I want to have life and
[21:28] have it more abundantly I don't want to
[21:30] just get by and so there's this caution
[21:32] that don't trouble yourself or your
[21:34] house being greedy for gain by
[21:36] satisfying the lust of the Flesh and let
[21:39] allowing that to have preeminence and he
[21:41] that hateth gifts shall live that word
[21:43] gifts there means
[21:44] bribes something that's given to
[21:47] influence judgment given to influence a
[21:50] decision and the these gifts that were
[21:53] offered by ba to Bam it it made him
[21:57] vulnerable to
[21:59] Temptation because it was kind of that
[22:01] that enticement that trap for the Bible
[22:04] even I think being silent and it doesn't
[22:07] let balam get away with it it calls him
[22:09] out later on in numbers 31 it calls him
[22:11] out in Revelation and second Peter he
[22:13] gets called out but in the silence the
[22:16] Bible allows it to be silent how balum
[22:18] goes undercover and silently and works
[22:21] something out with Bao to cause Israel
[22:23] to
[22:24] stumble what did that he was greedy for
[22:27] reward he loved the wages of
[22:30] unrighteousness greed caused balum to
[22:33] overvalue money to overv Value
[22:37] possessions just as Judas might have
[22:39] thought well I can Christ will get out
[22:41] of this he's the Messiah I I can make
[22:43] this all work but what got him in that
[22:44] position he loved the money that was in
[22:47] the
[22:48] bag it caused bam to overvalue money to
[22:51] overvalue oportunity and he might think
[22:53] well if I've got money I can do this if
[22:55] I have money I can do that many times
[22:57] people say well they rationalize well if
[22:59] I can do this and I can do that I'll
[23:01] have a lot of money I'll be able to help
[23:02] this out you know brother Aaron I'm GNA
[23:05] go do this and I'm GNA do that and you
[23:06] know don't you worry I'll be making so
[23:08] much money we'll we'll build two
[23:09] churches one in Phoenix and one in
[23:11] Jackson Wyoming and I say praise no
[23:14] brother pray about it
[23:16] right there's a and the promises are
[23:19] made but then you realize is that just a
[23:21] way to make somebody feel good about
[23:23] what they're about to do and their
[23:24] family never sees them again for the
[23:25] next 3 months got to be very very
[23:28] careful
[23:30] we put too much value on money and I'll
[23:32] say this as families we've got a balance
[23:34] sheet and we got line items in this
[23:36] balance sheet that are worth a lot more
[23:39] than anything tangible or
[23:42] material and though this greed caused
[23:45] him to overvalue money I would say worse
[23:48] it caused him to devalue God's word
[23:51] worse it caused him to devalue God's
[23:53] people worse it caused him to devalue
[23:55] the gift that he had it drove balam to
[23:58] disarm
[23:59] honesty because of this opportunity he
[24:02] held a little bit back and then he began
[24:03] to lie then he began to act wrong it
[24:05] corrupted his decisions it it was
[24:07] undermining his teaching every time he
[24:09] opened his mouth Israel was blessed so
[24:11] they were blessed people what does he do
[24:12] he causes the wrath of God to come upon
[24:14] Him by teaching them how to stumble if
[24:17] you look at the scripture balam went
[24:18] from being a prophet to a
[24:20] soothsayer because of money because of
[24:23] the lust of the
[24:25] flesh as these things are related we
[24:27] mentioned this maybe a couple Services
[24:28] ago brother bandam saying these are
[24:30] things a minister must watch a minister
[24:31] must watch in 1 Timothy 3:3 it speaks of
[24:35] a bishop the one holding an office of a
[24:37] pastor should not be given to Wine no
[24:40] Striker not greedy a filthy ler but
[24:42] patient not a brawler not
[24:45] Covetous the Bible's not just saying
[24:47] this as uh if it all possible you know
[24:53] as much as lith within you don't get
[24:55] into fist
[24:56] fights he said you can't be that you you
[25:01] can't be Covetous you can't be a striker
[25:03] you can't be a brawler you you can't be
[25:06] somebody who's quick to punch somebody
[25:08] out you can't be somebody who's jealous
[25:09] and possessive you can't be given to
[25:11] these other intoxications so it it's not
[25:14] just simply a well when you're
[25:16] interviewing pastors just see how many
[25:17] check marks you can get next to these
[25:20] things but it says a not greedy of
[25:23] filthy looker that means eager for
[25:26] money he's concerned or D driven by
[25:29] money and we say well as long as we
[25:32] don't uh as long as we're poor we're
[25:34] okay but it's not just a matter of being
[25:37] wealthy as the scriptures teach us in
[25:40] other places that it's a trap to be rich
[25:42] but for the poor it's a trap to want to
[25:43] be rich so it's not just in the having
[25:46] but it can also be in the not
[25:48] having so it's not just being wealthy
[25:51] but it can be the wrong attitude towards
[25:53] money or the wrong use of money you
[25:57] worry about it
[25:58] you're controlled by it you're selfish
[26:01] with it you only use it at times where
[26:03] it fits you uh uh meets your own means
[26:06] and needs I've seen many situations
[26:09] where in a church I think we've alluded
[26:11] to this a little bit on Sunday where the
[26:14] money is Consolidated in with the pastor
[26:16] and most people are very good at their
[26:17] tithing and in tithing that 10% going to
[26:20] the pastor uh and for the pastors used
[26:23] to support Ministry and in churches
[26:24] where uh maybe everyone ties but they
[26:27] don't pay offerings then there's a lot
[26:29] of tithing but there's no offering and
[26:30] it comes time to do something the church
[26:32] needs something a and the pastor says
[26:34] well I tell you what I think we should
[26:35] do this and I think we should do that
[26:37] and some of the people and the trustees
[26:38] are like well I don't know that kind of
[26:41] sounds illegal brother right and the
[26:43] pastor says well fine then I won't I
[26:45] won't I won't Finance it I won't support
[26:46] it I'll just take my plans and a and go
[26:49] do my own thing a and and the trustees
[26:53] are kind of left out of it because they
[26:54] realize well at the end of the day the
[26:55] pastor's the one with the money so if
[26:57] he's not on board with it and what can
[26:58] he do he can control the whole thing
[27:01] through money whether it be a little or
[27:04] a lot but brother Brandon is talking
[27:06] about uh these types of things in church
[27:09] order and he says the trustees don't
[27:11] have to ask brother Neville if he wants
[27:13] the roof put on the Tabernacle that's
[27:15] the pastor no no that's nothing to
[27:18] brother Neville it's nothing to me
[27:21] remember when they were remodeling the
[27:23] Tabernacle and brother bam says I I
[27:24] would have voted against it putting all
[27:26] this money into the church and we
[27:27] believe Jesus is coming he said I would
[27:29] have voted against it and that's just
[27:31] brother brandham saying that's what he
[27:33] would do and he tells us because as a
[27:34] prophet even one with the contrary
[27:36] opinion to what the people were choosing
[27:38] he didn't bud in and say my name's on
[27:40] the sign you're not doing it the pastor
[27:42] didn't say well I've got the money
[27:43] you're not doing he says that's a
[27:44] decision that's entrusted in certain
[27:46] individuals to make that decision with
[27:49] this particular money and it's not for
[27:51] the pastor to
[27:52] control and just as pastors can be
[27:55] tempted to misuse the money in those
[27:57] ways and I'm only using as an example
[27:59] that sometimes money means more if money
[28:01] is a problem the lust of the flesh is a
[28:02] problem it can be more pervasive and
[28:04] more subtle and be applicable in a lot
[28:06] more ways than just wow he's rich and
[28:08] that's his biggest problem or he just
[28:10] wants to be rich and that's his biggest
[28:14] problem it's a vast area if all that is
[28:18] in the world is the lust of the flesh
[28:19] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[28:20] life that covers a lot doesn't it
[28:23] therefore money women and popularity
[28:26] cover a lot it covers it all
[28:29] probably as we read this earlier 1
[28:32] Timothy chapter
[28:36] 6 and this godliness with contentment is
[28:40] great gain is what he's building this on
[28:42] brought nothing into this world surely
[28:44] we're going to take nothing out so he
[28:45] says but they that will be
[28:48] rich now it's not saying it's not the
[28:51] proposition that anybody who's rich will
[28:54] do this but it's the wrong attitude
[28:56] towards the money wrong attitude towards
[28:58] the wages wrong attitude towards the
[29:00] reward remember when Jesus said it's
[29:02] harder for a rich man to enter into the
[29:04] kingdom of God than it is for a camel
[29:05] through the eye of the needle and
[29:07] there's no rationalizing with that and
[29:08] trying to say well it's just difficult
[29:10] Jesus uses an extreme almost impossible
[29:12] example to get the people's attention
[29:14] that there is a great Temptation when it
[29:16] comes to wealth great Temptation for
[29:19] rich people to trust in the richest a
[29:21] great Temptation for rich people to use
[29:23] their riches in the wrong way so it's a
[29:27] caution about money they that will be
[29:28] rich fall into temptation and a snare
[29:31] into many foolish and hurtful lust which
[29:33] drown men in destruction and
[29:36] predition let's say it together this
[29:38] phrase for the love of money is the root
[29:41] of all evil let's say it together for
[29:43] the love of money is the root of all
[29:46] evil why were you mumbling some of you
[29:50] the love of money is the root of all
[29:52] evil that's right which while some
[29:55] coveted after what money they have aired
[29:57] from the the faith and Pierce themselves
[29:59] through with many
[30:01] Sorrows as I was studying this phrase
[30:04] this
[30:06] week it's interesting um maybe just the
[30:09] word choice the love of money is the
[30:11] root of all evil and the root would be
[30:13] the progeny or offspring and you can say
[30:15] that money is definitely love of money
[30:19] lucer Springs forth from something evil
[30:22] but it's used in uh we recognize this to
[30:25] be and most people would agree on this
[30:27] and brother Bram shows this way that
[30:29] it's the love of money from which
[30:30] Springs forth evil and we could
[30:33] certainly say it's the root of these
[30:35] things in verse nine the love of money
[30:37] is the root of many foolish and hurtful
[30:41] lust which drown men in destruction and
[30:44] predition the love of money is the root
[30:46] of all evil in other words it leads to
[30:48] Temptation it promotes jealousy it
[30:50] encourages arrogance it'll cause
[30:54] murder remember the error of Judas
[30:59] who for
[31:01] money participated in a conspir
[31:04] conspiracy against
[31:06] Christ we mentioned this before I think
[31:09] it was in May of this year how that one
[31:11] out of 10 verses in the gospels I think
[31:13] 288 Total Focus directly on the subject
[31:17] of money one out of
[31:22] 10 in 16 of Jesus's 38 Parables he deals
[31:26] with possessions material possessions
[31:27] posessions or
[31:29] money there's over 2,000 verses in the
[31:31] Bible that address money and possessions
[31:35] around 500 on prayer and less than 500
[31:37] on faith but over 2,000 dedicated to
[31:41] money and material possessions why
[31:43] because it's those things that are a
[31:45] stumbling block to prayer they'll cause
[31:48] us to pray the wrong
[31:51] way we fleece God so much he's thinking
[31:53] that we we got a flock of sheep
[31:58] just 500 on prayer less than 500 on
[32:00] faith but 2,000 that address money and
[32:03] possessions why because the Love of
[32:05] Money diminishes
[32:07] character it increases our
[32:11] anxiety it distracts us from the
[32:14] word the word of God I is is instructing
[32:18] us and showing us that to spend money
[32:21] wisely is it going to make you a
[32:23] Christian to be broke doesn't make you
[32:26] more spiritual
[32:28] but the fact that we want to grow and be
[32:31] cultivated and develop in the word of
[32:33] God we want to use our Liberty to become
[32:35] like Christ we know that power apart
[32:37] from character satanic we know that
[32:38] we're to come into the image of God and
[32:40] that has nothing to do with necessarily
[32:42] what's seen then we know that in our
[32:44] hearts the devil would want to do
[32:45] anything he can to keep us from becoming
[32:48] all that we can be and so stumbling
[32:50] blocks are the only things that he can
[32:52] use in money is one of his biggest
[32:54] stumbling
[32:56] blocks because it causes us to to Veer
[32:59] from the right
[33:01] path Paul in writing to Timothy said
[33:04] which while some coveted after they have
[33:06] aired from the faith they didn't aim at
[33:09] Faith they didn't aim at the word like
[33:12] Abel who pleased God by Revelation and
[33:14] that was satisfactory he says many when
[33:16] they get their eyes on money are no
[33:18] longer aiming to please God by faith but
[33:21] to please themselves by
[33:23] lust they've aired from the faith
[33:26] brother Bram said when a man gets his
[33:28] mind on money he loses god wow because
[33:32] if you if you listen if you got your if
[33:35] when a man gets his mind on money he
[33:37] loses
[33:39] God he says in another place when a man
[33:41] gets to a place he just has to scream
[33:44] and cry and Carry On and think so much
[33:46] of money he forgets God he's gone that's
[33:50] all there is to it that's right he says
[33:53] it takes him out of God's
[33:55] harness words God's using you God's
[33:57] blessing you and then as soon as you
[33:59] begin to yell and scream and push and
[34:01] pull for money God's like
[34:03] whoa I that's not me I'm not driving you
[34:05] to do that you're not doing my will when
[34:08] a man gets his mind on money he loses
[34:10] God so you don't want your mind on your
[34:12] money and your money on your mind you
[34:15] want to keep God the word at the
[34:18] Forefront when a man gets to a place he
[34:20] has to carry on about money he forgets
[34:23] God what his trust is no longer in the
[34:26] Lord he said that's all there is to it
[34:28] he's
[34:30] gone not only have they coveted after
[34:32] they've aired from the faith and pierced
[34:34] themselves through with many Sorrows you
[34:38] want to bring a dark cloud over yourself
[34:41] get your mind on
[34:42] money you want to drive yourself crazy
[34:45] get your mind on money you want to lead
[34:47] yourself to doing a lot of things that
[34:48] are out out of character get your mind
[34:50] on money money can cause people to act
[34:53] in very strange ways we can be so
[34:56] distrustful from God that were afraid to
[34:59] do something because of the financial
[35:01] impact and not just trust God I can
[35:05] relate to times in my life where I felt
[35:06] like God was calling me to do something
[35:08] and situations were getting to where it
[35:10] was untenable it was no longer pleasing
[35:11] to the Lord but yet you find some
[35:13] comfort in what you know you find some
[35:15] comfort in a standard of living based
[35:17] upon where you can work and and whatever
[35:19] support you might be getting and there's
[35:21] this feeling of well I I it's really
[35:22] hard to forsake the known to launch out
[35:25] into the unknown
[35:28] and and I remember I was in a situation
[35:30] where I just didn't know what to do and
[35:31] I knew God wanted me to change things
[35:33] and I was just going to have to trust
[35:34] the Lord and step out and I begin to
[35:36] make a stand for the word of God I begin
[35:38] to make a stand for my family I begin to
[35:40] purpose in my heart that I wasn't going
[35:41] to be controlled uh by money women or
[35:44] popularity and politics and as I begin
[35:46] to make that decision God laid it upon
[35:48] someone's heart I don't think I've ever
[35:50] told this testimony publicly they let it
[35:52] on their heart they flew into town they
[35:53] shot up they said I want to go to lunch
[35:55] with you and they told me said brother
[35:56] Aaron God's put it in my heart to to
[35:58] support you financially and this is how
[36:00] much I want to give you and he said this
[36:02] is how much I want to give you H H it
[36:04] was a group said we want to give you
[36:06] this much uh uh and we just we'll do it
[36:08] for a year and then we'll re-evaluate at
[36:09] the end of that
[36:11] year and I I took that that offering and
[36:15] I put an account that I used for
[36:17] Ministry a year and a half later when I
[36:19] moved to Phoenix that amount that they
[36:22] said they would give to me a year and a
[36:23] half before was to the dollar what my
[36:25] rent was when I moved here and I had it
[36:27] in the B
[36:28] when I got here and I I testify that to
[36:32] say I know what it's like to be in a
[36:36] panic when it comes to providing for
[36:39] your family paying bills I can testify
[36:42] I'm not up here thinking well he's a
[36:44] rich lawyer he can rail on money all day
[36:45] long show me someone who will pay me my
[36:48] hourly rate who wants to pay me my
[36:50] hourly rate and I can get rich but
[36:52] people don't want to pay that hourly
[36:53] rate I'm not a rich
[36:56] lawyer or am I I got to keep people
[36:59] guessing I'm not a rich lawyer trust
[37:03] me there's it is a battle and so listen
[37:07] to what brother bham says in the sermon

[38:54] people BMS aren't just for Bishops
[38:59] they're for believers to be cautioned
[39:08] by and does God ever change his mind
[39:10] about his
[39:12] word he says balum had a gift of
[39:16] faith and could have used it to the
[39:19] perfect original word of God could we
[39:22] just be a little bit mature tonight glad
[39:24] it's on a Wednesday night what is the
[39:26] perfect original word of God
[39:28] what is God's perfect and original way
[39:30] to receive anything what is it that
[39:33] pleases God what is it that we're to
[39:35] look to above everything else the word
[39:38] the word the word that's in no means
[39:40] limiting God in the way that he can move
[39:42] it certainly by no means limits how God
[39:44] can manifest himself but it does limit
[39:46] what our emphasis should be it does
[39:48] limit on what we put our faith in and
[39:51] what we put our evidence in we don't put
[39:53] our evidence in sensation we put our
[39:55] evidence in believing and receiving the
[39:57] word of God that doesn't mean just
[39:58] because you can say Amen to the message
[40:00] of the hour like this doesn't mean
[40:01] you've got it but it's when you can
[40:02] receive the word have a clear
[40:04] understanding and demonstrate by a life
[40:06] lived by the word that the word is
[40:08] dwelling in you bam had a gift of faith
[40:11] and could have used it for the perfect
[40:14] original word of God to stay true to how
[40:17] the messenger taught it to stay true to
[40:19] the word in that Exodus and he says many
[40:22] men on the field today with gifts of
[40:24] healing could do the same thing many men
[40:28] out here people speaking in tongues
[40:30] people prophesying a gift could use it
[40:33] for the kingdom of God but they don't do
[40:36] it they don't use it for the perfect
[40:40] original word of God they use it for the
[40:42] tongues and the prophesying and the
[40:44] gifts they don't use it to lift up the
[40:46] pure word of God they do it to lift up
[40:49] personalities and
[40:51] themselves this is the temptation of a
[40:54] for
[40:56] AUM he said they take and God blesses
[40:59] them anyhow gets the permissive
[41:02] will now it's God permits it he said but
[41:05] for popularity and Pleasures personal
[41:09] gains sold their birth rights as Esau
[41:11] did sold out to an
[41:14] organization sold out like balum
[41:18] did so many are doing the same or doing
[41:22] today the same
[41:23] thing we know that's right they sell out
[41:26] their Birthright
[41:28] don't any of you sell your Birthright
[41:31] Esau was a profane person sold out his
[41:34] Birthright you can say for popularity
[41:35] for Pleasures for personal gain even if
[41:38] it's not a Pulpit even if it's not a
[41:40] gift even if it's not a Ministry none of
[41:41] us should sell out our birthrights as
[41:44] Believers for popularity for Pleasures
[41:46] for personal gain he says women
[41:49] professing the Holy Ghost wearing shorts
[41:51] man per permitting them in the Pulpit
[41:53] bobbed haired women in the pulpits pain
[41:54] on their face with religious gowns on
[41:56] the biggest stuff stumbling block the
[41:58] church has ever
[42:00] had the misuse of a
[42:02] gift inordinate emphases the
[42:07] wrong the the the the true anointing on
[42:09] the false
[42:10] expression brother B time and time again
[42:13] was constantly he doesn't he doesn't say
[42:15] that Pentecost is wrong if we say
[42:17] Pentecost is just emotion or Pentecost
[42:19] is happiness and joy and shouting and
[42:21] dancing speaking tongues he doesn't say
[42:23] that's wrong but where he saw the air is
[42:25] when the people with the bobbed hair and
[42:26] the makeup and the worldly living and
[42:28] everything we're doing we're doing it
[42:30] right and participating in it and people
[42:32] are saying r on you got it you done
[42:35] good and not calling it out as hey you
[42:38] know that's wonderful letting out the
[42:40] steam every once in a while but you
[42:41] better be sure you're born again by the
[42:42] word of
[42:44] God he say it's the biggest stumbling
[42:46] block the church has ever had I believe
[42:49] in the day and age that we're living in
[42:50] the Love of Money the lust of the flesh
[42:54] is a problem not just for pulpits
[42:58] something that all of us must be uh uh
[43:00] sensitive to brother Micah please come
[43:02] brother Elliott can come to your
[43:05] instruments and the sermon show us the
[43:07] father and it'll satisfy I want us to
[43:08] end with this and this could be our
[43:11] prayer he says if you ever want to pray
[43:14] for
[43:15] me it's not to have money not to have
[43:18] big homes or be
[43:20] popular but just
[43:23] pray that I can stay in the hands of
[43:26] Christ
[43:28] mold clay that he can mold me and use me
[43:32] in any way that he sees fits to do it
[43:34] could you look at that don't pray that
[43:37] God bless me with money don't pray that
[43:40] God gives me a big home let don't
[43:41] support me in those things so I can do
[43:43] that or or don't pray that I could be
[43:44] popular don't pray for money women and
[43:46] popularity don't don't pray that I have
[43:48] these things but if you could just pray
[43:49] that I stay in the hands of Christ as a
[43:52] lump of clay to be
[43:54] molded in a way that he could use
[43:57] in a way that he see sees fit to do it
[44:00] if brother Brandon would say could you
[44:02] pray that for me couldn't we shouldn't
[44:05] we pray that for
[44:07] ourselves that Lord I don't want to pray
[44:09] that I have money I don't want to pray
[44:10] to have a big home I don't want to pray
[44:11] to be popular I don't want to pray to
[44:13] have friends you realize how many people
[44:15] make decisions based upon social things
[44:18] they make decisions based upon the lust
[44:20] of the flesh the lust of the eyes and
[44:21] the pride of life when it comes to where
[44:23] they go to
[44:24] church because they're praying for money
[44:27] big homes in popularity and what they
[44:29] don't want is to be on God's
[44:31] will to be a piece of clay that could be
[44:34] molded wow brother Bram says could you
[44:37] pray that way for
[44:39] me and next statement he says I'll pray
[44:42] the same thing for you that you'll be
[44:45] the same way am it's good for us
[44:48] too he'll pray the same thing for you
[44:53] that you'll be the same way then let's
[44:55] make a promise no offense to anybody
[44:58] here but I'm not going to pray that you
[44:59] get rich I'm not going to pray that you
[45:01] have big homes I'm not going to pray
[45:02] that you're popular but I'm going to
[45:04] pray that you as God's clay could be
[45:08] molded therefore that you could be used
[45:11] as he sees fit isn't that where we want
[45:13] to be isn't that the place we want to
[45:16] find ourselves in knowing that there
[45:17] there's
[45:18] provision there there's pleasure there
[45:21] there's peace there God satisfies what
[45:24] the lust of the flesh can never satisfy
[45:27] there God satisfies what the lust of the
[45:29] eyes can never satisfy there God
[45:31] promotes and honors to which the pride
[45:34] of life could never
[45:36] satisfy so we pray today that we would
[45:38] be in the hands of Christ as clay molded
[45:41] and used in a way that Christ sees fit
[45:45] pray that for one another pray that for
[45:48] yourself let's stand and pray this
[45:50] tonight
