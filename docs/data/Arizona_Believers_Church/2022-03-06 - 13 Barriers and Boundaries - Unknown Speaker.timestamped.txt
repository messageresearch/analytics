[0:00] acts chapter 28 verses 1 to 6. in
[0:03] reading this
[0:04] and understanding that we're going to be
[0:06] finishing
[0:07] this theories on barriers and boundaries
[0:10] you may feel like i've got a long ways
[0:12] to go to get to this scripture and i do
[0:14] and you might be thinking how is he
[0:15] going to loop this back around but i
[0:17] believe god's going to be able to do it
[0:19] and and i trust it will be a blessing to
[0:20] you acts chapter 28 verses 1 to 6.
[0:24] and when they were escaped they knew
[0:26] that the island was called malita and
[0:28] the barbarous people showed us no little
[0:30] kindness for they kindled a fire and
[0:32] received us everyone because of the
[0:34] present rain and because of the cold
[0:36] when paul had gathered a bundle of
[0:37] sticks and laid them on the fire there
[0:39] came a viper out of the heat and
[0:41] fastened on his hand he was bit by a
[0:43] snake
[0:44] and when the barbarians saw the venomous
[0:46] beast hang on his hand they said among
[0:48] themselves no doubt this man is a
[0:50] murderer
[0:51] whom though he hath escaped the sea yet
[0:53] vengeance suffereth not to live
[0:55] and so we understand this is after their
[0:57] shipwreck as he was on his way to rome
[1:00] on this island of malita gets bit by a
[1:02] snake the barbarous people there like
[1:05] yep he's getting what this is karma in
[1:07] their minds right he's getting what's
[1:08] coming to him he's survived the
[1:10] shipwreck and now he's getting his just
[1:12] desserts and it says in verse 5 and he
[1:14] shook off the beast into the fire and
[1:16] felt no harm and i want to come to that
[1:18] at the very end he shook off the beast
[1:20] into the fire and felt no harm
[1:22] how be it they looked
[1:24] when he should have swollen or fallen
[1:26] down dead suddenly but after they had
[1:28] looked a great while and saw no harm
[1:30] come to him they changed their minds and
[1:32] said that he was a god
[1:34] amen praise the lord god bless you can
[1:37] be seated
[1:41] oh how quickly the barbarians change
[1:43] their mind
[1:48] my title today is let's go forward
[1:51] and
[1:52] the
[1:53] i want to just kind of give you
[1:55] uh
[1:56] the road map for this morning's service
[1:58] i want to conclude on the subject of
[2:01] respect and then i want to kind of
[2:03] summarize the entire uh subject of
[2:05] barriers and boundaries
[2:07] and then i want to just kind of seal it
[2:09] with this message let's go forward and
[2:11] if that sounds like a three-hour sermon
[2:13] you expected it you get what you expect
[2:17] if it's a 30-minute sermon and that's
[2:19] what you think you get what you expect
[2:20] right so we'll either feel like 30 or
[2:22] feel like three
[2:26] i don't know i'm just going to preach
[2:28] but the uh so i know that may seem like
[2:30] there's a lot there i want to i want to
[2:32] conclude some things on respect and then
[2:34] i want to kind of just give a quick
[2:35] summary to the whole subject of barriers
[2:37] and boundaries and then conclude with a
[2:40] message
[2:41] in the same subject it's going to fit
[2:42] it's going to just seal in the subject
[2:44] of barriers and boundaries now on the
[2:46] subject of respect this is
[2:49] some review but maybe just a slight step
[2:51] forward just to seal up what we've been
[2:53] talking about on respect and at the core
[2:56] about uh the subject of barriers and
[2:58] boundaries is respect you'll find that
[3:01] you could probably look back through the
[3:03] other 12 parts we've ministered on this
[3:05] and realized that yes whether it be god
[3:07] being a god of boundaries
[3:09] and what that means to us is we must
[3:11] respect his boundaries and and however
[3:13] we looked at it even if you looked at
[3:15] god being boundless it's just it's the
[3:17] perspective or how you look at it in
[3:19] with respect to something and so there's
[3:21] different ways that respect is at the
[3:23] core of this
[3:24] and when it comes to our personal
[3:27] boundaries and even the barriers that we
[3:29] face in life and interpersonal
[3:30] relationships we find that
[3:33] the issue of respect has to do with
[3:34] respecting others but then also
[3:37] respecting ourselves
[3:39] and i would say and reinforce this as
[3:42] we've expressed this in the past that
[3:44] boundaries
[3:45] are about relationships uh relationships
[3:48] one to another and then the
[3:49] responsibilities we have to each other
[3:50] the responsibility we have to ourself
[3:53] with
[3:54] within um our
[3:56] calling and our position
[3:58] and i was pondering this last week and
[4:00] realized that you could define a
[4:02] relationship or come to understand
[4:04] uh
[4:06] the type of relationship someone has to
[4:08] somebody else and the kind of the
[4:09] character of it and the nature of it
[4:11] just based upon the respect and
[4:14] responsibility
[4:15] if you begin to define well that there's
[4:18] there's a there's a love there there's a
[4:19] reverence there there's this particular
[4:21] duty there's that particular duty you
[4:22] can say oh that person's a wife
[4:24] right just by describing how they feel
[4:26] about somebody and then the
[4:28] responsibilities they have to them you
[4:29] say oh well that person must be a dad so
[4:32] it's the respect and the responsibility
[4:34] that even defines a relationship
[4:37] and respect means to regard which is has
[4:41] its kind of roots in to judge or to
[4:42] consider to regard or to esteem
[4:45] someone or something and to esteem is to
[4:47] estimate to determine or to value
[4:49] something so respect uh has to re has to
[4:52] do with esteeming valuing judging
[4:55] regarding
[4:56] uh or determining valuing something and
[4:59] it comes from the phrase or the word to
[5:01] the very act of looking at someone
[5:03] and that's why you can use the word
[5:05] respect in its relationship and its
[5:07] position and you say well it's it's
[5:09] second uh in line with respect to the
[5:12] house on the corner you could use it in
[5:14] that terminology but the way we're
[5:15] looking is kind of this courteous
[5:17] treatment
[5:18] uh this considerate conduct that someone
[5:20] is due you say that he showed him the
[5:22] respect that he deserves or you respect
[5:24] him as an elder you respect them as your
[5:27] parents
[5:28] and and so this is something that when
[5:30] someone is do something because of their
[5:32] position they do something because of
[5:34] their calling or they do something
[5:36] because it's something that they deserve
[5:38] that is respect
[5:40] and i wanted to use this statement like
[5:42] wednesday night and we held it off till
[5:44] today and i want to use it just to show
[5:46] how important respect is
[5:48] and stay with me because this is a this
[5:50] is a hard saying he says our nation has
[5:52] come
[5:53] so little until they've even taken the
[5:55] jobs away from the men and put women out
[5:57] here in these places to 90 of them
[6:00] nearly are prostitutes that's a that's a
[6:02] hard that's a hard saying
[6:04] and talk about man being gone sure it's
[6:07] because they got woman out there in
[6:09] their jobs and they got so low down till
[6:11] they put women as peace officers on the
[6:13] street
[6:14] that's a disgrace to any nation yes sir
[6:17] now that's you'd agree that that's a
[6:19] pretty heavy statement now what you
[6:21] could i was fellowshipping with some
[6:22] brothers last week on this very
[6:24] statement
[6:25] and that has a lot of uh maybe shock
[6:27] value
[6:29] and the way that it's worded today
[6:30] especially today but then you try to
[6:33] that when you ponder what it is he's
[6:34] looking at and how women have left their
[6:37] place and men have left their place
[6:39] that's kind of the root of what he's
[6:41] looking at so even some of the language
[6:43] that might seem to be very shocking we
[6:45] kind of get down to it we realize the
[6:47] point he's trying to make so then he
[6:48] asked this question what are you going
[6:50] to do about it
[6:52] what do you do about it brother branham
[6:54] so he's asked what are you going to do
[6:55] about this situation where
[6:57] women are taking over men's jobs and men
[6:59] aren't in the place that they ought to
[7:00] be and society is losing uh uh
[7:04] losing its moral compass and the
[7:05] government is letting it happen what do
[7:07] you do
[7:09] you stormed the capital right
[7:13] right
[7:14] you you you protest you
[7:17] you refuse to submit you you you you
[7:19] enter into a revolution in a rebellion
[7:21] and and i believe we've read this
[7:23] statement from the last couple months
[7:24] now brother brahm said one of the
[7:25] beauties of the wesleyan revival is it
[7:28] didn't necessarily the overthrow of
[7:31] england like that was one of the
[7:32] beauties of the revolution i it didn't
[7:35] overturn the government there was still
[7:36] a spiritual revival and the government
[7:39] still stood and says what are you going
[7:41] to do about it brother branham
[7:43] i have to respect it
[7:47] he says i'm an american citizen i do
[7:49] what the big boss says do
[7:53] come on somebody
[7:55] maybe we should have read this before
[7:56] they started lifting all the masked
[7:57] mandates right
[7:59] maybe we should have read this before
[8:00] brother so and so joined the freedom
[8:02] convoy
[8:03] but this is i don't know if a brother
[8:05] has it but um
[8:07] says i do what the big boss says do
[8:10] think about that this is brother ramsay
[8:12] i don't agree with him this is wrong and
[8:14] he uses some really really charged
[8:15] language but he says this is i live in
[8:18] america
[8:19] and if if the government says to do it
[8:20] if this is what the big boss says do he
[8:22] says i do he says i have to respect it
[8:24] now notice the next point because i
[8:26] think this is even more important if a
[8:28] family ever loses its respect for the
[8:30] family the children lose the respect for
[8:32] the parents that family is tore to
[8:35] pieces
[8:36] respect is what holds
[8:37] together
[8:38] he says a family in which the children
[8:40] lose respect to the parents the family
[8:43] is tore to pieces
[8:44] then he says if a church ever loses
[8:46] respect of its pastor why that church is
[8:49] gone
[8:50] now i i don't believe he's suggesting
[8:51] that all of a sudden the next sunday the
[8:53] doors are locked and the windows are
[8:55] boarded up so the church loses something
[8:57] he said it's unmoored it's untethered
[8:59] it's gone and and maybe it even implies
[9:02] that it's eventually going to end in
[9:04] ruin if you lose respect for your
[9:05] parents the family gets tore to pieces
[9:07] you lose respect for the pastor why that
[9:09] church is gone and if a nation ever
[9:11] loses their respect to the supreme court
[9:13] and its decision decisions that nation
[9:15] has gone to pieces
[9:17] i believe he's making a very important
[9:19] point
[9:20] that we can take from it that respect is
[9:22] so important with in relationships uh
[9:24] from parents to children and husband to
[9:26] wife and even within the church and then
[9:28] he's even making this point on a larger
[9:31] scale to help us to understand how
[9:33] important it is within the family and
[9:34] within the church he said if you lose
[9:36] respect for those who are charged and
[9:38] entrusted with making decisions the
[9:40] supreme court those that would have been
[9:42] making these decisions that he's
[9:44] referring to here if you don't respect
[9:46] it that's where the nation goes to
[9:48] pieces
[9:49] isn't it interesting that he identifies
[9:51] how that the nation has gotten very very
[9:54] low but what's going to cause it to fall
[9:56] to pieces is when with people fail to
[9:58] respect those who are making decisions
[10:00] even if you disagree with them
[10:02] i hope i'm not losing any any friends
[10:04] this morning stay with me
[10:06] we're just reading the statement i'm not
[10:08] i'm not implying uh anything anyway
[10:10] besides maybe i'm a libertarian
[10:13] right so you you all of you could hate
[10:15] me then
[10:16] but it says we got to respect i'm not a
[10:19] libertarian we've got to respect those
[10:21] things
[10:22] because they're the big boss
[10:24] he's saying he's laying it out we've got
[10:25] to respect those things because they're
[10:27] the big boss he says but it isn't right
[10:28] in the beginning
[10:30] you can disagree you can feel that it's
[10:32] wrong it's immoral it's low he says but
[10:35] once if a decision has been made and
[10:37] this is the way that it is
[10:39] he's telling us that showing respect is
[10:41] important
[10:43] very important even in the face of
[10:44] disagreement he's saying that there has
[10:46] to be respect there within the family
[10:48] within the church even within our
[10:50] government
[10:51] and now again we're just trying to
[10:52] conclude these things on respect
[10:55] and so we've identified a number of
[10:56] scriptures that speak to
[10:58] uh the respect for one another
[11:01] and even how that love your enemy is to
[11:03] respect your enemy not this warm fuzzy
[11:06] feeling that if i gotta love my enemy
[11:08] like i love my wife no it's a respect
[11:10] you hold for him not so much eve with
[11:14] the
[11:15] proper discernment of what he is it's i
[11:18] know this is an enemy brother brahm said
[11:19] any person that is against the word of
[11:21] god is your enemy but that doesn't mean
[11:23] we treat him
[11:24] as the world would treat an enemy we do
[11:26] it as christ told us love your enemies
[11:28] so you still have that respect even if
[11:30] somebody's against the word of god you
[11:32] have respect for them so to love your
[11:34] enemy is to respect them and to regard
[11:36] them as an enemy but respect them for
[11:40] what they are they're a person
[11:42] there there's someone that god has made
[11:44] promises to because you want to look at
[11:46] them and say lord even though they may
[11:48] be an enemy today i have respect for
[11:51] what they can be
[11:53] saying for love thy neighbor as thyself
[11:55] it's a respect for your neighbor
[11:57] and to trespass against an enemy to
[11:59] trespass against not so much in their
[12:01] opinion but in the way that against the
[12:04] word of god against someone else to
[12:06] trespass against someone is an act of
[12:08] disrespect even the bible tells us whoa
[12:11] offenses will come but woe unto you from
[12:13] whom the offense has come
[12:16] and so where we were ending wednesday
[12:17] night and we went through matthew
[12:19] chapter 18 to examine this that the word
[12:22] in first corinthians 5
[12:24] and 6 that the word admonishes us
[12:27] to not trespass against others
[12:30] over and over again even when the word
[12:32] is saying if somebody trespasses against
[12:34] you we ought to read that and say well
[12:36] then i i shouldn't be trespassing
[12:38] against anyone it's instructive to us
[12:41] and so where it admonishes us not to
[12:43] trespass against others and then to
[12:45] handle how to handle situations when we
[12:48] are trespassed against
[12:50] now i want to go through
[12:53] maybe eight or nine scriptures here and
[12:54] i want to do it very quickly so i've
[12:56] just provided them to you here so you
[12:58] could jot them down
[13:00] and i'm doing this just as an overview
[13:03] of how the the new testament recognizes
[13:08] a trespass
[13:10] somebody who may be against what you
[13:12] believe or get something against you
[13:13] personally or behave in a way that
[13:16] transgresses against your autonomy your
[13:18] christian liberty
[13:20] and notice how the word of god is
[13:23] bringing it up saying this is what we
[13:24] ought to do in matthew chapter 18 verse
[13:26] 15 mo moreover if thy brother shall
[13:29] trespass against thee go and tell him
[13:31] his fault between thee and him alone you
[13:33] go to them just you too nobody else and
[13:36] if he shall hear thee thou hast gained
[13:39] thy brother
[13:40] what does the bible continue to tell us
[13:41] jesus says that if he won't hear you you
[13:43] bring two you bring a witness
[13:45] and two witnesses and then if they won't
[13:47] hear them then you bring it to the
[13:48] church and if he still refuses to hear
[13:50] he's to become as a heathen man and the
[13:52] publican
[13:54] and so if your brother does not res if
[13:57] your brother does not hear he does not
[13:58] listen does not understand and the bible
[14:00] even says if he does not repent then you
[14:02] are to respect him as a heathen and
[14:05] republican
[14:06] in other words relationship changes when
[14:09] respect is lost
[14:11] brother branham says it that's what
[14:12] happens if a family ever loses respect
[14:14] the families toward appeases if the
[14:15] church loses respect the church is gone
[14:17] uh and and there's this there's this
[14:20] idea that relationship is lost and
[14:21] relationship changes and so if you
[14:24] continue we'd say if you want to have
[14:26] friends show yourself friendly if you if
[14:28] you want to lose friends show yourself
[14:30] unfriendly
[14:31] show yourself disrespectful and a true
[14:34] friend is eventually going to say you
[14:35] know what you can't treat people that
[14:37] way
[14:39] and even to the point towards like you
[14:41] you hold people accountable for the way
[14:43] that they act and the way that they talk
[14:44] and the things you do and eventually
[14:45] it's like you know what i've been
[14:46] long-suffering i've been patient i've
[14:48] been kind but i cannot continue to allow
[14:50] you to abuse to mistreat and conduct
[14:52] yourself in this way so i'm going to
[14:54] draw a line oh you're just not going to
[14:55] have everything to do with me anymore no
[14:57] that's not what i'm saying i'm saying
[14:58] but our relationship changes from this
[15:00] day forward
[15:01] something is lost when respect is lost
[15:05] in first corinthians chapter 5 verses 1
[15:07] to 13 paul is saying not to keep company
[15:09] not to eat
[15:10] to put away from yourselves anyone
[15:12] that's an idolater a fornicator somebody
[15:14] who uses force to get something anybody
[15:16] who's greedy or verbally assaults or is
[15:19] very anyone who's a drunkard he's saying
[15:21] these very specific phrases don't keep
[15:23] company not to eat put away from
[15:25] yourselves this wicked person
[15:27] first timothy chapter six verses three
[15:29] to five if any man teach otherwise and
[15:32] consent not to wholesome words even the
[15:34] words of our lord jesus christ and to
[15:36] the doctrine which is according to
[15:37] godliness he's gonna tell you what they
[15:39] are he is proud knowing nothing but
[15:41] doting about questions and strifes of
[15:43] words where have cometh envy strife
[15:45] railings evil surmisings perverse
[15:48] disputings of men of corrupt minds and
[15:50] destitute of the truth supposing that
[15:52] gain is godliness
[15:54] in other words those who are rich and
[15:56] have possessions use it as evidence that
[15:59] they're righteous or right and he says
[16:01] from such withdraw thyself
[16:04] that's quite the command keep away have
[16:05] no communion have no fellowship from
[16:07] such withdraw yourself from those who
[16:09] fit these characteristics he writes
[16:11] again in second timothy chapter three
[16:13] verses one to five very familiar to us
[16:15] this know also that in the last days
[16:17] perilous times shall come for men shall
[16:18] be lovers of their own selves covetous
[16:20] bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient
[16:22] to parents unthankful unholy without
[16:25] natural affection truce breakers false
[16:27] accusers incontinent fierce despisers of
[16:29] those that are good traitors heady
[16:30] high-minded lovers of pleasures more
[16:32] than lovers of god having a form of
[16:34] godliness but denying the power thereof
[16:37] that's a mouthful
[16:39] from such turn away
[16:41] i'm saying avoid them in titus chapter 3
[16:43] verses 9 and 10 but avoid foolish
[16:45] questions and genealogies and
[16:47] contentions and strivings about the law
[16:49] for they are unprofitable in vain
[16:51] a man that is a heretic after the first
[16:54] and second admonition reject
[16:57] so a heretic may be admonished once even
[16:59] twice he says after that reject them
[17:01] they're very instructive and again i'm
[17:03] not maybe giving context to them just
[17:05] reading these so that you see that
[17:06] there's a uh treat him as a heathen man
[17:09] and a publican and from such withdraw
[17:11] myself from such turn away avoid and
[17:13] reject and romans 16
[17:15] uh 17. now beseech you brethren mark
[17:18] them which cause divisions and offenses
[17:20] contrary to the doctrine which you have
[17:22] learned and avoid them
[17:24] you've been taught something you mark
[17:26] those who cause division and walk
[17:29] differently
[17:30] and cause offenses contrary to the word
[17:32] which you've been taught he says avoid
[17:34] them
[17:35] 2 thessalonians chapter 3 verse 6. now
[17:37] we command you brethren in the name of
[17:38] the lord jesus christ that you withdraw
[17:40] yourselves from every brother that
[17:42] walketh this orderly and not after the
[17:44] tradition which he received of us
[17:47] again you notice the there's a theme
[17:49] here in a lot of different places
[17:51] and then in second thessalonians 3 14
[17:53] and if any man obey not our words by
[17:55] this epistle note that man and have no
[17:57] company with him that he may be ashamed
[18:00] i hope that you understand i'm just
[18:01] reading these things to you so that you
[18:03] can see these are principles in the word
[18:04] of god and as with any principle in the
[18:07] word of god you must pray for revelation
[18:10] that god would reveal to you
[18:12] what it means but then also that god
[18:14] would buy revelation reveal to you
[18:16] whatever application that might have in
[18:18] your life because what's more important
[18:20] is that we get a revelation and we obey
[18:21] by revelation than just beating into
[18:24] everybody by education well you know the
[18:25] bible says this and the bible says that
[18:27] then you get very very very strict very
[18:29] rigid and you might seem to be
[18:31] technically in compliance with what paul
[18:33] said well i'm just marking those that
[18:34] cause divisions and i'm avoiding them
[18:36] but you've completely left the spirit of
[18:37] it out
[18:38] and you can never actually fulfill it if
[18:41] you're not doing it in the spirit that
[18:42] wrote it
[18:44] so these were just mentioning these so
[18:45] that you could see wow it's amazing just
[18:48] how often the word of god is telling me
[18:51] that i can draw a line
[18:54] ii john 10 and 11 if there come any unto
[18:57] you and bring not this doctrine receive
[19:00] him not into your house neither bid him
[19:02] god's speed
[19:03] for he that biddeth him god's speed is a
[19:05] partaker of his evil deeds
[19:07] aren't we all glad we don't ever say
[19:09] god's speed anymore
[19:10] right
[19:11] because that would really make us
[19:12] complicit
[19:14] and those and there's a lot of meaning
[19:16] behind this to where it's not just that
[19:18] we give everybody a questionnaire and
[19:20] says are you bringing the doctrine of ii
[19:22] john
[19:23] and then if not say well i can't have
[19:24] you in my home there's obviously more
[19:26] meant to this but at least we could say
[19:27] there's some place
[19:29] in the word of god that's identifying
[19:31] some circumstance where this is
[19:32] applicable
[19:34] they're not to be received into the
[19:35] house neither bit of god speak because
[19:37] to bid somebody god's feeder to give
[19:38] them the blessing is to partake in his
[19:40] evil deeds
[19:42] so just looking at all these scriptures
[19:44] you can realize
[19:47] that there's a there's a point at which
[19:49] a limit that is reached or something
[19:51] that is violated
[19:52] and in the violation the word of god is
[19:54] saying that you have a duty to respond
[19:56] to particular error you have a right to
[19:57] respond a particular way and say that in
[20:00] in light of this something changes
[20:03] this is this is a line that's crossed
[20:04] and then i have this responsibility to
[20:06] conduct myself and to regard something a
[20:09] particular way so i'm mindful of the
[20:11] nature of their transgression
[20:14] and and i use some discernment and
[20:16] caution some a different kind of respect
[20:18] or regard in this instance
[20:20] and i would put it this way that the
[20:22] bible is telling us to use boundaries to
[20:24] divide define our relationship with
[20:26] anyone that would fit these categories
[20:28] instead of just barriers to ignore them
[20:31] and you'll find that the bible is very
[20:32] deliberate in the way that uh the uh the
[20:35] scripture
[20:36] um and i don't even know if i finish
[20:38] this it says if any man obey not our
[20:40] word by this epistle note that man and
[20:42] have no company with them that he may be
[20:44] ashamed
[20:46] so paul is not just there's this there's
[20:48] this he's interested in a conduct that
[20:50] not only protects your faith and and
[20:52] keeps your spirit clean but that it kind
[20:55] of has this reciprocal of a response and
[20:57] every action has an equal and opposite
[20:58] reaction that this one who's offending
[21:00] me realize oh wait a minute this conduct
[21:03] isn't right
[21:04] there's a consequence for this conduct
[21:06] and that that would prick the heart of a
[21:08] real son of god and a daughter of god to
[21:10] be like oh i'm sorry i need to make this
[21:13] right which is exactly what jesus is
[21:14] detailing says if you go to your brother
[21:16] and him alone and tell him that he's
[21:18] offended you a brother who's
[21:19] understanding what you're saying and say
[21:21] i'm sorry
[21:23] i said that if he doesn't quite get it
[21:24] the first time the second time he'll get
[21:27] it
[21:27] and a brother who doesn't quite get it
[21:29] the second time the third time
[21:32] he'll get it and somebody who doesn't
[21:34] get it the third time he's really not a
[21:35] brother treat him is not not a brother
[21:38] right it's just it's almost common sense
[21:40] that someone who realizes there's been a
[21:41] transgression or who recognizes they've
[21:43] done something wrong is going to take
[21:44] steps to repent and to make it right and
[21:47] so we're not just using barriers to
[21:49] ignore an offense or using barriers to
[21:51] keep your distance or use barriers to
[21:53] try to just avoid the situation but it's
[21:54] a proper conduct in face of opposition
[21:57] or persecution or trespasses or offenses
[22:00] to preserve your integrity remain
[22:02] steadfast uh as brother loyal ministered
[22:05] i'm gonna have a steadfast faith i'm
[22:06] gonna persevere through this but then
[22:08] also have this
[22:10] uh kind of conduct that brings about a
[22:12] conviction as brother reggie was
[22:13] mentioning to the young people this
[22:15] reproof which is this exposure with the
[22:17] view to correction we're like oh i've
[22:20] harmed i've transgressed i've done
[22:21] something that's not right i want to
[22:22] correct this
[22:24] and i believe the word is clearly
[22:26] authorizing us as believers to use
[22:28] judgment
[22:29] to use discernment about these things
[22:33] now as we've read these several
[22:35] scriptures
[22:36] and that say from such withdrawal myself
[22:38] from such turn away avoid reject avoid
[22:40] them withdraw yourself have no company
[22:42] with them neither bid them god speed or
[22:44] receive them into a house don't not to
[22:46] keep company treat them as a heathen man
[22:47] and republican boom boom boom boom all
[22:49] these different things what's the
[22:50] purpose of that limit
[22:53] what's the purpose for that kind of
[22:54] protective decision or
[22:56] or what's the purpose for establishing
[22:59] that standard
[23:00] defining that boundary that we could
[23:02] walk together but to this we can have
[23:04] this kind of discourse this kind of
[23:06] conversation we can have this kind of
[23:08] fellowship but it's at this point that
[23:10] we draw the line
[23:11] and maybe to help you to understand that
[23:14] in a church
[23:15] there's those that we can have free
[23:17] fellowship with and we treat them as a
[23:19] brother and sister and we
[23:21] and they have every rights uh that a
[23:23] brother and sister would have within the
[23:24] church as far as fellowship and
[23:26] opportunity to come to service but there
[23:28] are certain situations or things that
[23:29] they might want to do or offices they
[23:32] might want to hold or certain services
[23:33] they might want to perform but there's a
[23:36] standard that if they violate that they
[23:38] might lose that opportunity you
[23:41] understand that so it's in the same way
[23:43] that we might have that dynamic within
[23:44] church of god there's a certain thing
[23:46] where we could treat somebody as a
[23:47] brother we can treat them with respect
[23:48] we can love our neighbors as ourselves
[23:50] we can love our enemies and we can do
[23:52] good unto those especially those in the
[23:53] household of faith but we realize this
[23:55] we're not being compelled to do things
[23:58] that transgress the word of god
[24:00] compromise the word of god or defile our
[24:03] spirits
[24:04] so there's a standard that's lifted up
[24:06] and why is the standard there
[24:08] as we read already from first
[24:09] corinthians chapter 5
[24:11] in verse 6 he says your glory is not
[24:13] good know ye not that a little leaven
[24:15] leaveneth the whole lump
[24:17] so in the very context of paul saying
[24:19] this sin is bad and you guys were puffed
[24:21] up and you didn't recognize how bad that
[24:23] was and even from where i was i judged
[24:25] it already and when you get back
[24:27] together you judge this because do you
[24:28] not know that as christians we're going
[24:30] to judge angels we're going to judge the
[24:32] world should we not judge matters that
[24:34] pertain to this life should we not have
[24:36] discernment even even the smallest
[24:38] matters this is what he's telling the
[24:40] church and he says and this is the
[24:42] principle that just kind of is at the
[24:43] core of all of it because a little
[24:45] leaven leaveneth the whole lung
[24:47] that's what he's looking at just a
[24:48] little bit of
[24:50] the the wrong kind of attitude towards
[24:52] sin the wrong kind of welcoming to the
[24:54] wrong to the wrong kind of nature it's
[24:56] gonna have the it's gonna when it runs
[24:58] of course everyone's gonna be affected
[25:00] by it
[25:01] know you not that a little eleven
[25:03] eleventh the whole proverbs chapter 22
[25:05] verses 24 25 make no friendship with an
[25:08] angry man
[25:09] and with a furious man thou shalt not go
[25:12] this is a very plain plainly articulated
[25:16] scripture
[25:18] make no friendship with the man that's
[25:20] angry
[25:22] speak steve a character
[25:23] you could probably use this in an
[25:25] instance just use it when a man is angry
[25:27] let's you know you might want to keep
[25:28] your distance
[25:30] right
[25:31] the bible talks about you know it's
[25:33] better to live in a shack than it is a
[25:34] large house with a railing woman or a
[25:37] a um a loud woman it's these are
[25:40] relationship parameters these are this
[25:42] is wisdom from the scripture god and say
[25:43] well if somebody's angry maybe you don't
[25:45] want to conduct yourself in a familiar
[25:47] way or a friendly way you have to keep
[25:49] your distance make no friendship with an
[25:50] angry man and with the furious man thou
[25:52] shalt not go
[25:54] why
[25:55] why that seems really really strict us
[25:58] angry men are like why why
[26:00] well let's thou learn his ways and get a
[26:02] snare to thy soul
[26:04] i mean this is very instructive that if
[26:07] you go with a man that is fierce if you
[26:08] make a friendship with someone's angry
[26:10] it
[26:11] it's uh
[26:12] it's contagious
[26:15] it can be it can it can go viral and you
[26:17] can catch something and you can all of a
[26:19] sudden you find you you make friendship
[26:20] with an angry man and all of a sudden
[26:22] you're like i'm angry too
[26:24] that makes me upset i never thought i
[26:26] could be this angry and it's all because
[26:28] the person got you all riled up like i
[26:30] never thought i'd have a take on that
[26:33] and and there's it's it's instructive
[26:35] make no friendship with an angry man if
[26:36] somebody's furious don't go with them
[26:38] you're going to get caught up in the mob
[26:39] mentality there's it's something that's
[26:41] contagious there's a con emotional
[26:43] contagion with these things it's a real
[26:44] danger to
[26:46] social media networks whether it be
[26:47] whatsapp or facebook just the way things
[26:49] can kind of sweep into your spirit you
[26:51] take up causes there's an emotional
[26:52] contagion that's with that with respect
[26:55] to these friendships and these bonds
[26:56] that we form you'll learn his ways and
[26:59] it's not just learning his ways but
[27:00] you're going to get a snare to your soul
[27:03] it hinders your spirit it brings you
[27:05] down
[27:06] paul says it again in first corinthians
[27:08] 15 33 be not deceived evil
[27:10] communications corrupt good manners
[27:14] so if you're around criticism and
[27:17] constant negativity and
[27:19] and uh
[27:21] just rumor-mongering whatever it might
[27:22] be says this is going to corrupt your
[27:24] conversation it's going to corrupt your
[27:26] attitude and your spirit the way you
[27:27] conduct yourself
[27:29] it says it in second timothy chapter 2
[27:30] verses 16 to 17. i hope you can see how
[27:33] these things are sewn into the fabric of
[27:35] this
[27:36] this broad picture of conduct and
[27:38] attitude this is the reason why there's
[27:40] a limit this is the reason why there's a
[27:42] standard this is the reason why there's
[27:43] a protective barrier shun profane in
[27:46] vain babbling for they will increase
[27:48] under more ungodliness
[27:50] not they may
[27:52] not that it's possible or probable but
[27:54] that it will
[27:55] increase under more ungodliness
[27:58] it could we do could the holy spirit do
[28:01] some identifying in our lives or maybe
[28:02] we could do a little bit more some
[28:04] discerning in our own life and realize i
[28:06] i have engaged in a lot of profane and
[28:08] vain babbling and that's the re that's
[28:11] the cause
[28:12] to the ungodliness in my life
[28:15] there's a direct causal connection he's
[28:17] not saying there's a correlation he says
[28:19] they increase under more ungodliness
[28:21] it's just going to get this momentum and
[28:22] increase into moral and goddess profane
[28:24] and vain babblings are ungodly and they
[28:26] only increase under moral guidance it
[28:28] said their word will eat as doth a
[28:29] canker
[28:30] he calls out some names but we just left
[28:32] them out he says those words they eat
[28:35] these uh profane and vain babblings eat
[28:37] they eat at your spirit they're
[28:39] corrosive
[28:40] the more negative you speak about
[28:42] somebody the more negative you're going
[28:43] to feel about somebody
[28:46] anymore there's a lot of situations
[28:47] where it's like i just would rather not
[28:50] know
[28:51] like i i know the situation i know how
[28:54] they are i know this situation i know
[28:56] that situation i've heard it we agree i
[28:58] have the same appreciation for its lack
[29:00] of integrity i have the same
[29:01] appreciation for how wrong it is how
[29:03] immoral it is how it whether it doesn't
[29:05] comport with our constitution or whether
[29:07] this is shouldn't be happening that
[29:08] should be i get it but the more negative
[29:10] that you feed on the more negativity you
[29:13] hear the more just begins to defile your
[29:15] spirit defile your spirit defile your
[29:16] spirit and it eats as a canker
[29:19] it's gonna eat up your joy it's gonna
[29:21] eat up your peace it's gonna eat up your
[29:22] happiness it's gonna eat up your
[29:23] enthusiasm and eat up your ambition it
[29:25] may not take away your salvation but all
[29:27] the things that salvation is supposed to
[29:29] purchase you just got something
[29:33] where it's like at the end they go
[29:35] i have to get vaccinated i have to wear
[29:38] masks but thank god i'm saved
[29:41] it's like man come on there's more to
[29:43] life
[29:45] there's more to experience there's more
[29:46] to enjoy but we let things eat away
[29:48] eat away at our spirits i'm glad that
[29:50] they're starting to lift these things so
[29:51] you could talk about them without it
[29:53] being too much of a a a sore subject
[29:55] with some people
[29:57] remember the statement we read on
[29:59] wednesday night brother brown says
[30:00] temper breeds temper
[30:02] the family's fussing and you're being
[30:04] ridiculed you're being
[30:06] mistreated being disrespected he says no
[30:08] don't
[30:08] this is me using summary language don't
[30:10] respond
[30:12] you know if you fight back you fight
[30:14] fire with fire
[30:15] you're just gonna get a bigger fire
[30:17] what do you fight fire with water right
[30:19] did i get it right fire
[30:21] fire people fire persons are we being
[30:23] politically correct in 2022
[30:25] uh the firemen amongst us you fight fire
[30:27] with
[30:28] water now i realized to the hot shots
[30:31] around hill there's certain instances
[30:32] where you might remediate and do certain
[30:34] things with fire before the fire comes
[30:37] but what you do if you want to put a
[30:39] fire out you're going to fight it a
[30:40] certain way brother i'm saying don't use
[30:42] fire to fight fire don't escalate it
[30:44] don't if they get angry and you fuss
[30:45] you're just going to take their spirit
[30:46] on you
[30:47] he says could temper breed's temper and
[30:50] we were using it in this sense
[30:51] especially in light of what brother i'm
[30:53] saying there's people you love to be
[30:54] around
[30:55] and he says there's people you can't
[30:56] stand to be around he said but they're
[30:58] good people but they're critical they're
[30:59] caustic they're crunching things down he
[31:01] says and it kind of affects you it
[31:03] breeds something in you
[31:05] we receive thoughts we receive seed and
[31:08] it begins to grow in our spirits he says
[31:10] and so this the reason why the scripture
[31:12] is so detailed in these many different
[31:14] instances about drawing the line is
[31:16] because disrespect breeds disrespect
[31:20] if somebody transgresses the word of god
[31:22] and you don't have the right respect
[31:24] towards it
[31:25] then guess what happens it makes it
[31:26] easier for the next person transgress
[31:28] the word of god slight deviation from
[31:30] the word of god just begins also
[31:32] slightly everybody's ah it doesn't
[31:33] really matter what's going to happen
[31:35] years later
[31:36] you get so far away from the truth you
[31:38] get so far away from the standard and
[31:40] everyone stand in the spot and they all
[31:42] feel justified because they don't
[31:43] recognize the incremental process they
[31:46] went through to get to the place that
[31:47] they are
[31:49] and people can love it and embrace it
[31:50] and it may seem like it's perfectly
[31:52] justifiable but it was because some
[31:54] standard is violated and it just breeds
[31:56] more and more and more
[31:58] remember in the very context of that
[32:00] statement we are atmosphere creators we
[32:02] have the ability to create an atmosphere
[32:04] and not just good ones
[32:07] can i get a witness we can create bad
[32:09] atmospheres we can do things that bring
[32:12] breed negativity and bring a dourness
[32:14] and a sourness in our spirits
[32:17] and so the bible tells us that we too
[32:19] we're to be heart keepers we have to
[32:21] guard our hearts
[32:22] we're to watch over our spirits we're to
[32:24] watch over our bodies
[32:26] why because they're the lords
[32:29] we we protect our bodies the body's a
[32:31] temple our spirits
[32:33] are need to be kept clean we guard our
[32:35] hearts we keep our hearts we are called
[32:37] and tasked with being wall builders
[32:39] build up the walls of jerusalem oh lord
[32:41] let us build up these walls let us
[32:43] clearly define our relationship to the
[32:45] lord let us clearly define our
[32:47] relationship to the world lord let me
[32:49] build up the standard lift up these
[32:50] things that are righteous and holy that
[32:53] i might keep my spirit clean so that in
[32:55] the time and the moment that i need
[32:56] access to the word of god that i i need
[32:58] your virtues to be flowing freely
[33:00] through me there's not a lot of barriers
[33:01] that are in the way
[33:05] and so that that concludes
[33:08] the thought on respect and now i want to
[33:11] again visit in general the subject of
[33:14] barriers and boundaries
[33:17] and
[33:18] there are two different things barrier a
[33:20] barrier to boundary or two different
[33:21] things
[33:22] and it's important that we recognize the
[33:24] difference and if it seems like i'm
[33:25] backing up i am i'm just taking a step
[33:27] back just to kind of give this overview
[33:28] as we
[33:29] we conclude
[33:31] a boundary indicates the limit of
[33:33] something
[33:35] and it's uh maybe a very important way
[33:37] of describing is the boundaries the
[33:38] dividing line
[33:40] and in the very beginning god laid out
[33:42] boundaries and there's a dividing line
[33:44] what could be done what couldn't be done
[33:46] we saw the image of the moon and the
[33:48] stars and where he hung everything and
[33:50] he placed everything and and and it it
[33:52] became a controlling agent even over
[33:54] certain things upon the earth and
[33:56] gravity
[33:57] and so boundaries the furthest point of
[33:59] something our property extends to this
[34:01] border
[34:02] or this extends to this boundary it's a
[34:04] dividing line it's the limits of
[34:05] something
[34:07] but a barrier is something that
[34:09] obstructs
[34:10] something that gets in a way a barrier
[34:11] is an obstacle a barrier there could be
[34:14] a wall and there could be an entrance
[34:15] and there's a door but you wouldn't the
[34:17] door is not a barrier the door is the
[34:19] proper point of entry through the wall
[34:22] you don't climb over it you don't dig
[34:23] under it you don't tear it down you go
[34:25] to somebody's house you don't just bang
[34:26] on the garage door let me in
[34:29] you go to the front door and you knock
[34:30] you don't you don't find a window that's
[34:32] open or you don't say this this spot
[34:34] here looks easier to plow through than
[34:36] any other you observe the doorway as the
[34:40] proper way to enter within the boundary
[34:42] and you park on the driveway of the
[34:44] street not the lawn right there's just
[34:46] these appropriate places this is just
[34:47] real simple today
[34:49] just we're getting right where the
[34:51] rubber meets the roads stop parking on
[34:52] people's lawns
[34:57] and i just know there's probably a
[34:58] situation where somebody is right now
[35:00] going i can't that is so petty i can't
[35:02] believe they told him that
[35:03] like why would they even text brother
[35:05] aaron and tell him that it didn't happen
[35:08] it didn't happen
[35:10] maybe just discernment this morning you
[35:12] better all be careful
[35:16] but a a barrier is something that would
[35:18] obstruct your way into
[35:21] something
[35:22] you have a door and that's the proper
[35:23] way to get in but there might be a
[35:25] barrier that's put there and it's trying
[35:26] to keep something out that otherwise
[35:28] would be able to get in and it's
[35:30] important to kind of recognize the
[35:31] difference what a boundary is what a
[35:32] barrier is because we used it this
[35:34] context we're just using a language to
[35:36] understand principles god uses
[35:38] boundaries but satan uses barriers
[35:41] and where the trick is sometimes we see
[35:43] a boundary and in our minds you think oh
[35:45] well that's just a barrier uh let's just
[35:47] get rid of that because it's just a
[35:49] barrier keeping us from fellowship but
[35:50] in reality it was a boundary that god
[35:52] had said
[35:53] or you might see something said oh well
[35:55] that's just a uh that's just a um you
[35:57] see something says oh that's a boundary
[35:59] uh we we ought to not do it but it's
[36:00] just a barrier
[36:02] and we're misunderstanding that one is
[36:05] just trying to get in the way to keep
[36:06] you from enjoying the limits of
[36:07] something whereas something else is the
[36:09] actual limits of enjoyment so god is the
[36:12] one that sets and respects boundaries he
[36:14] even does it for us
[36:16] does he not
[36:18] he respects our limits he respects our
[36:20] boundaries but satan's the one that sets
[36:22] barriers and he's constantly
[36:23] disrespecting boundaries
[36:26] and as we look at boundaries and if
[36:28] boundaries is a the limitation of
[36:30] something or it's a dividing line it's
[36:31] interesting that you could begin to look
[36:33] at the word of god and say well it says
[36:34] i can't do this it says i can't do that
[36:36] and it says this is appropriate but this
[36:38] isn't appropriate and certain people
[36:39] look at the word of god and say i'm
[36:41] fenced in i'm caged in but the
[36:42] boundaries of the word of god are not
[36:44] put there to bind us or bring bondage
[36:47] but to put us in the right channel so
[36:49] that we can we can live as overcomers
[36:53] god knows the way that we are made he
[36:54] knows the heart of man he knows what our
[36:57] purpose is he knows what our calling is
[36:58] and so the boundaries give us a true
[37:01] power and a true sense of identity
[37:04] think about how crazy the world is
[37:06] getting when when a child is born say
[37:09] well you can't assign a gender
[37:11] all right
[37:12] and just how confusing a life would be
[37:14] if it's like well mom i think i'm a boy
[37:16] will you just give it time
[37:18] you know you just give it time and he
[37:20] said well you know what you're right mom
[37:21] i thought about it i'm just a girl and
[37:23] says well now you've discovered two but
[37:24] there's more
[37:26] right
[37:27] that you just live on a spectrum you
[37:29] live on a scale there's this fluidity
[37:30] that you can have within yourself that's
[37:32] untethered from biology and you can kind
[37:34] of just pick and choose whatever you
[37:35] want to do that's just going to generate
[37:36] so much more chaos
[37:38] because how is a person ever going to
[37:40] understand and recognize what god has
[37:42] equipped them to do and what they're
[37:43] calling in task is if everything is
[37:45] without boundaries without uh borders
[37:48] without callings without limits it's
[37:50] important in order to have a true sense
[37:52] of identity and that true sense of
[37:54] identity is not a bondage
[37:56] it's not a restraint it's liberating to
[37:58] recognize who you are
[38:01] and so it was in this that we referenced
[38:03] we use the subject of the pride paradox
[38:06] and how that we have to have a a good
[38:08] pride
[38:09] has to be there's a healthy sense of
[38:11] self there's a proper perspective as the
[38:13] bible says you ought not to think more
[38:14] of yourself than you should but by the
[38:17] inverse you shouldn't think less of
[38:18] yourself
[38:20] a lot of times we kind of hit on why are
[38:21] you you know he that stands you know
[38:23] better think twice
[38:24] lest he fall and you say i want to think
[38:26] more of yourself but i don't fulfill the
[38:28] scripture by thinking less of myself
[38:31] if the way up is down it's not that we
[38:33] would be so self-effacing and we'd be so
[38:36] uh down on ourselves and haunted
[38:38] ourselves that we would miss the true
[38:39] promise of god to us so there must be a
[38:41] healthy pride that in order to set
[38:43] boundaries and say this is my limit and
[38:45] there must be a healthy pride in order
[38:47] to defend those boundaries and know what
[38:49] god's called you to a healthy pride to
[38:51] say you know i know god called me to do
[38:52] this i know god's called me to be this
[38:55] person i know this is who i am and and
[38:57] it takes some unction and it takes some
[38:59] persistence and perseverance for someone
[39:01] to step into that
[39:03] i know someone says well that's a little
[39:04] bit arrogant that's a little presumptive
[39:05] you say well no this is what god's
[39:07] called me to do that's a healthy sense
[39:09] of calling that's a healthy sense of
[39:10] pride and then once you're in that call
[39:13] and it takes a real healthy pride to be
[39:15] perseverant to be adamant no this is
[39:17] what he called me to do i'm going to be
[39:18] persevered i'm going to hold out to the
[39:20] end you can't cause me to waver and then
[39:22] anyone coming and says well you know
[39:24] that you're really not a christian you
[39:25] know you really shouldn't be doing you
[39:26] know and you're like oh well oh oh maybe
[39:28] i'm not it takes some healthy pride
[39:30] to stand there and say i'm standing on
[39:32] god's promises i'm standing on god's
[39:35] word
[39:37] and so there's a
[39:39] it has to take a healthy sense of pride
[39:41] but not too much pride right
[39:44] unless you step out of your parameters
[39:46] step beyond your calling step beyond
[39:47] what god's called you to step beyond
[39:49] really who you are or even worse you
[39:52] step beyond somebody else's limits
[39:55] can have too much pride to where you
[39:56] disregard or disrespect somebody else's
[39:58] boundaries
[40:00] but then
[40:02] you don't want to have
[40:03] so little pride to where all you can use
[40:05] is barriers
[40:08] excuses
[40:11] it's the pride paradox
[40:13] this is this is i think this is review
[40:16] obviously
[40:17] and then in setting limits in setting
[40:19] limits we
[40:20] we felt to examine
[40:23] the myths regarding christian liberty
[40:24] and christian virtue that there's
[40:26] certain scriptures in luke chapter six
[40:28] and matthew chapter five where it kind
[40:29] of paints this picture of somebody
[40:31] who is weak
[40:33] and just has to give in to every beating
[40:34] and get it give in to every every abuse
[40:37] and every situation we found that
[40:38] meekness is not weakness but meekness is
[40:41] to actually have power but choose not to
[40:43] use it
[40:45] and that there is a there's a there's a
[40:47] kind of a misunderstanding of christian
[40:49] virtue
[40:50] where the christian virtue then opposes
[40:53] personal liberty and that we have the
[40:56] right to say no and there's times when
[40:58] we absolutely have to say no because
[41:00] there's conditions that humans and
[41:02] christians in the natural there's
[41:04] conditions that humans cannot exist in
[41:06] and in the spiritual there's conditions
[41:08] that god does not demand that you stay
[41:10] in
[41:12] and that god knows your limits and
[41:14] recognizes this this is even in the
[41:16] sense that love has limits it knows your
[41:18] limits and knows you cannot you can only
[41:20] go so far and god's not going to demand
[41:22] that you stay in a situation that's
[41:23] going to destroy you demoralize you
[41:25] strip away your faith so you can have
[41:26] confidence that if you cannot stand that
[41:28] situation there's going to be a grace
[41:30] that god's going to give you in it to
[41:32] bear up against it because he knows your
[41:34] limits
[41:36] we looked at the scripture how turning
[41:37] the other cheek was not to invite to be
[41:39] smacked als likewise on the other cheek
[41:42] but according to the message of the hour
[41:44] and even the way that jesus expressed it
[41:46] that when someone disrespects you
[41:48] and tries to condemn you and and show a
[41:51] force and a certain dominance over you
[41:53] you respond in such a way that rebukes
[41:55] the offender
[41:57] you don't run away from them
[41:59] you don't freeze
[42:01] but you also don't fight
[42:03] but you have a way to say well why did
[42:05] you do that brother
[42:07] and it ought to be the kind of conduct
[42:09] that's attention grabbing number one you
[42:11] don't have power over me
[42:13] you don't scare me
[42:15] and you're not bigger and stronger than
[42:17] me so that i feel like i've got to fight
[42:18] you
[42:19] because it's the fighting back that
[42:20] makes them feel like see
[42:22] i'm the bad boy here
[42:24] they feel like they've got to fight me
[42:25] you don't fight back justifying their
[42:27] power over you vindicating their their
[42:29] their little thoughts that they have
[42:31] towards you it's a way that you respond
[42:33] that rebukes the offender and sets the
[42:35] limit that's not right
[42:38] and in that context you'd know that once
[42:40] they were put on notice
[42:42] that continue again
[42:44] we have a saying in arizona
[42:46] fool me once
[42:47] shame on
[42:48] shame on you
[42:50] for me once can't fool me again
[42:52] right is this point we say no sorry i've
[42:54] got to draw the line
[42:58] in proverbs chapter 22 verse 28
[43:02] this is
[43:03] my final uh um
[43:06] i i i could say just principle
[43:08] scriptural principles on the subject
[43:10] just to kind of bring it to a head and
[43:11] then use let's go forward as the climax
[43:13] the capstone of it proverbs chapter 22
[43:16] verse 28 says remove not the ancient
[43:18] landmark which thy fathers have set how
[43:21] many are familiar with this scripture
[43:22] different places in the bible that refer
[43:24] to similar situations remove not the
[43:26] ancient landmark which thy fathers have
[43:28] said the hebrew word landmark means
[43:30] boundary
[43:31] remove not the boundary remove not the
[43:34] set of bounds something that's been
[43:35] marked out and made very distinct sound
[43:38] elsewhere in the scripture it says that
[43:40] there's been a mark set and it says this
[43:42] is yours
[43:44] this is your inheritance
[43:46] this is yours to enjoy
[43:48] don't remove the boundary
[43:50] now you might not think oh well
[43:53] i want to move it because if i move it
[43:55] then then perhaps that gives me greater
[43:58] uh greater territory but as soon as you
[44:01] remove the boundary you've lost the
[44:03] authority
[44:04] now that the boundary's been removed the
[44:06] boundaries in question who's to say that
[44:07] you're not going to lose territory think
[44:10] think about it
[44:11] oh well i'm just expanding my borders
[44:13] i'm just well now there's a border
[44:15] dispute and when you begin to dispute it
[44:17] you've removed the landmark you've
[44:19] removed the standard isn't it amazing
[44:20] how some people fight against the
[44:22] standard as soon as you remove the
[44:23] standard something bad happens like well
[44:25] wait a minute that's not what i meant
[44:27] it's like well you that's what you
[44:28] wanted
[44:29] right
[44:31] uh this is what you thought it meant
[44:33] when we talked about equality or equity
[44:34] this is what you thought this is what
[44:36] you were this is what you're championing
[44:38] this is what you're asking for you got
[44:39] what you asked for now you don't like
[44:40] the results
[44:42] i think god had a better idea in the
[44:43] beginning didn't he his word his word
[44:46] knew he knew exactly what he was doing
[44:47] when he gave us his word he knew human
[44:48] nature he knew how far things could go
[44:50] he knew how bad things could get he said
[44:52] i'm going to set a standard and if you
[44:54] just follow this it's going to harmonize
[44:56] everything even to the point is like you
[44:58] don't need a king
[45:00] i can give you a prophet if you follow
[45:01] my word you won't ever need a king what
[45:02] did israel do is like no no we really
[45:04] really want a king well if you get a
[45:05] king this is what's going to happen
[45:07] ah that's fine we still want a king and
[45:09] guess what happened
[45:10] exactly what god said
[45:12] god knows he understands us so in that
[45:14] boundary and that mark
[45:16] there's even the the sense of if you
[45:18] remove the boundary
[45:20] and deuteronomy chapter 19
[45:22] that
[45:22] the meaning that's even set forth in
[45:24] proverbs 22 and in deuteronomy 19 14 is
[45:27] that remove not the boundary don't
[45:30] defraud your neighbor
[45:33] it's even kind of the idea behind an
[45:35] easement
[45:36] and and kind of this separation that you
[45:38] don't want to build right on the
[45:40] property line because even though you're
[45:42] enjoying and it's the use and enjoyment
[45:44] of your property right at the property
[45:45] line that wouldn't be fair to the
[45:47] neighbor
[45:48] because if he wanted to do the same
[45:50] thing he wouldn't be able to
[45:52] right anybody ever build a house and
[45:54] like you mean i can't build right up on
[45:56] the property line no it has to be ten
[45:58] feet offset why it's out of respect to
[46:00] your neighbor
[46:02] so that they're also 10 feet off and
[46:04] there's 20 feet be between your houses
[46:06] that's why our neighborhoods look like
[46:07] they do
[46:08] in the valley is these i this idea of of
[46:11] showing respect you don't want to take
[46:12] advantage of your neighbor you don't
[46:14] want to disrespect your neighbor so
[46:15] there's this don't push the limits don't
[46:18] don't overstep the boundaries says thou
[46:20] shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark
[46:22] which they of old time have set in thine
[46:25] inheritance which thou shalt inherit in
[46:27] the land that the lord thy god giveth
[46:29] thee to possess it
[46:31] i can say this
[46:36] these things were set for a reason
[46:43] and even if it may seem to be an offense
[46:45] to you
[46:47] and a transgression to you
[46:51] this is something you respect
[46:54] it's set for a reason respected even
[46:55] deuteronomy 27 says if you remove your
[46:58] neighbor's landmark you're cursed if you
[46:59] do
[47:02] that's just i'm just using these
[47:04] principles to understand boundaries are
[47:05] important they're so critical
[47:07] they're they're replete to the word of
[47:08] god i'm going back through
[47:11] the the dozens probably over 100 pages
[47:14] of notes
[47:15] of just from the message alone
[47:17] on this subject
[47:19] how broad it is and how deep it is
[47:22] on how this subject and again you say
[47:24] well it's just terminology i would agree
[47:26] it's just maybe a term that you use and
[47:28] you can just fit things within this
[47:29] paradigm and i recognize that but i
[47:31] don't want you to get the paradigm i
[47:32] want you to get the principle
[47:35] but these things are very important in
[47:36] the word of god jeremiah 6 16 thus saith
[47:39] the lord stand in the ways and see and
[47:42] ask for the old paths where is the good
[47:45] way and walk their end and you shall
[47:47] find rest for your souls
[47:49] walk in the way ask for the old paths
[47:52] ask for the good way that means it's
[47:54] something that's marked out it's
[47:55] something that's been traversed it's
[47:56] something that's been set these are
[47:58] parameters this is the right way to walk
[48:00] this is the right way to go this is a
[48:02] this is a clearly defined path this is
[48:04] where you want to be it says but they
[48:05] said we will not walk
[48:08] therein
[48:09] if i could say this in a very specific
[48:12] yet broad way to the subject of barriers
[48:14] and boundaries the word has been
[48:16] established
[48:18] we have been given the word we have got
[48:20] our confidence is restored into the
[48:22] bible restore we have a confidence in
[48:24] this written word of god we have a
[48:25] confidence that this bible is right and
[48:28] though some of us may carry different
[48:29] translations we know that ultimately
[48:32] it's the thought that's contained in the
[48:34] remix the thought that's contained in
[48:35] the letter and if you read a spanish
[48:37] bible you read a french bible if you
[48:39] have a the living bible and someone else
[48:40] has the king james american standard
[48:42] whatever it might be we might hold to a
[48:44] particular version because we see that
[48:46] it more adheres to
[48:48] kind of the original intent and certain
[48:50] things but we have to have the
[48:51] confidence that god is the one who has
[48:54] watched over this translation and it's
[48:56] not so much the letter but there's a
[48:58] spirit that's contained in it and that
[49:00] god will make himself known in it and
[49:03] we've got confidence in that
[49:05] the word has been given to us the
[49:07] message of the hour has been delivered
[49:09] if there's a specific number of tapes
[49:12] that that have been recorded and have
[49:13] been preserved and been provided a
[49:15] certain number of books that have been
[49:16] translated and printed then we have to
[49:18] have confidence that what god has
[49:19] preserved and what he has made available
[49:21] that in there are things that i need and
[49:24] i can have confidence and i can believe
[49:25] in and that it will give me faith
[49:29] we must stay within its protection
[49:32] we must respect its tenants if it says
[49:34] something no matter how hard it is we
[49:36] must have a respect towards it
[49:39] i would even go so far as to say if
[49:41] there's things in the bible and things
[49:42] in the message of the hour that you may
[49:44] not agree with be very careful that you
[49:46] still respect
[49:50] the respect is very important
[49:52] and as the bible is telling us to
[49:54] to remove not the ancient landmark but
[49:56] then even says remove not thy neighbor's
[49:58] landmark which they've set in thine
[50:00] inheritance
[50:02] we never want to disrespect a landmark
[50:06] we never want to disrespect a boundary
[50:08] and so that may make us cautious
[50:11] right now anything that
[50:13] is a bump and anything that's a hedge
[50:16] and anything that's a wall anything that
[50:18] might be in our way we just think oh i
[50:19] want to respect it but at the same time
[50:22] we're to never respect satan's barriers
[50:24] we can't stop rather at satan's barriers
[50:29] because you have not been called to just
[50:31] always stop where satan's built
[50:33] something
[50:34] well i guess satan
[50:36] built a wall
[50:38] well i guess satan did this i guess
[50:39] satan did that and you start looking at
[50:41] all these walls that's not how god made
[50:42] us
[50:43] pro psalms chapter 18 verse 29 for by
[50:46] thee i have run through a troop that's
[50:48] an obstacle impeding forward progress a
[50:51] troop would be a
[50:54] a
[50:55] band of
[50:56] soldiers i have run through a troop and
[50:58] by my god have i leaped over a wall
[51:01] that wall was a false boundary that wall
[51:04] said you can't come in but you've been
[51:06] called by god to go
[51:08] and so if there's a troop in your way
[51:10] you can run through it if there's a wall
[51:12] in your way you can leap over it
[51:15] he says by my god i can run through a
[51:17] troop by my god i have i can leap over
[51:20] all this is something that god is going
[51:22] to empower us to do something that god
[51:25] has uh asked you know that we must do as
[51:28] christians there's times when we've got
[51:29] to run through a troop
[51:31] there's times we've got to leap over a
[51:33] wall and if all of a sudden like well
[51:34] now everything's changed brother and at
[51:35] one point we're respecting all walls and
[51:37] now there's walls we gotta jump over
[51:38] yeah that's the challenge right
[51:41] when is someone's attitude towards me
[51:44] when is there a change in our
[51:45] relationship
[51:46] because there's a barrier that needs to
[51:48] be addressed or there's a boundary
[51:50] that's been violated
[51:52] is this something i need to step back
[51:54] and apologize for and and respect
[51:57] and moderate conduct or is there
[51:59] something that i'm looking at the
[52:00] devil's just trying to get in a way and
[52:02] i've still got to have the right
[52:03] attitude towards it there's still a way
[52:04] that i got to approach this to where i
[52:06] don't do something unreasonable or hurt
[52:08] somebody but we've got that's the
[52:10] challenges recognizing things that the
[52:11] devil is trying to bring division the
[52:13] devil's trying to destroy
[52:16] something because paul said the weapons
[52:19] of our warfare are not carnal
[52:22] but mighty through god to the pulling
[52:23] down of strongholds
[52:25] i was studying this scripture last week
[52:27] and and the way that paul is even
[52:29] describing and the other scriptures
[52:30] around it just seem to kind of paint
[52:32] this picture our tools are ready to
[52:34] clear the ground of any obstacle
[52:37] our tools are ready to remove every
[52:39] obstruction in order that we might grow
[52:41] into maturity
[52:43] amen to you i say this for you
[52:46] your tools what god has given you he's
[52:48] given to you that you might use in your
[52:50] own lives in order to remove every
[52:52] obstruction that's keeping you from
[52:53] growing into maturity
[52:55] if it's every thought we can bring
[52:56] captive if it's mighty to god to pulling
[52:59] down of strongholds that means that
[53:00] within your posse within your
[53:02] spirit there's been some bulwark some
[53:04] place that the devil has resided and
[53:06] he's there and he's like you got to
[53:08] respect my boundaries i got to respect
[53:09] my bounds he's like no i do not you're
[53:12] exactly the thing that god has told me i
[53:14] can root out of my life i can tear down
[53:16] and i can reject and get out because
[53:18] he's given me the tools to do it
[53:24] this is the challenge
[53:25] we build walls according to the word of
[53:28] god
[53:29] and we're to tear down every barrier
[53:31] that satan puts in our way
[53:33] we're staying the path maybe there's two
[53:34] different images of possessing ground
[53:36] and building up and building the walls
[53:38] of jerusalem but as we are on this
[53:40] highway to heaven we want to stay on
[53:41] that road
[53:43] not venture into ditches not allow
[53:44] things that would get in the way to
[53:46] obstruct us keep going forward
[53:49] in ephesians 2 14 for he is our peace
[53:51] with peace who hath made both one and
[53:54] hath broken down the middle wall of
[53:56] partition between us
[53:58] this is in the nature of god to tear
[54:00] down things
[54:03] that separate that divide that are
[54:05] contrary to the word of god
[54:08] so i say the word of god
[54:10] builds strong boundaries
[54:13] and it tears down
[54:15] every barrier contrary to his will
[54:17] that's what the word of god does
[54:20] and i
[54:21] and it's easier said than done right so
[54:24] we need a grace to do both
[54:26] we need a grace to set the boundary to
[54:28] set it in the right spirit not not harsh
[54:32] not rude
[54:33] but this is the right spirit to set the
[54:35] boundaries
[54:37] and i know there may be the instinct
[54:38] just to think about personal
[54:39] relationships and maybe i'll even admit
[54:42] to this
[54:43] that my my ministering on this has been
[54:45] informed by my experiences
[54:48] there might be things that i'm
[54:49] hypersensitive about even as i minister
[54:50] and you may not even be thinking about
[54:52] it at all and i would say that's
[54:53] wonderful
[54:54] i want it to mean to you what god wants
[54:56] it to mean to you
[54:58] so if you see this in terms of a
[54:59] schedule or places you go or something
[55:02] you would do for work or people you hang
[55:04] out with or if it has application within
[55:06] relationships we need god need god's
[55:09] grace to defying boundaries to build
[55:11] walls and we need his grace to address
[55:13] barriers
[55:16] because it's a challenge to recognize
[55:18] sometimes the difference
[55:21] so let's go forward
[55:24] let's go forward
[55:25] god last week in a very very
[55:28] deep way impressed upon me
[55:31] i
[55:32] just re-emphasized one thing and just
[55:34] clearly impressed upon me another that
[55:36] gave everything just settled my spirit
[55:38] and gave me this deep peace
[55:40] and i was impressed very deeply that
[55:41] this
[55:42] series was meant to do two things and i
[55:44] might have initially thought that it was
[55:46] in this first one
[55:47] that we would look into the word of god
[55:49] and point out how that god
[55:51] god has patterns of boundaries and satan
[55:53] has a pattern of barriers
[55:55] and that in looking at that
[55:57] and whether it be setting limits and
[55:59] love has limits and and the pride
[56:01] paradox and god is boundless and the
[56:03] gods boundaries and different ways that
[56:05] we looked at it that we were just
[56:07] equipping us to face relationships or
[56:09] decision-making or standard making from
[56:11] the sense that god is a god of
[56:13] boundaries and if you just disrespect
[56:15] god's boundaries there's a consequence
[56:17] and so that's a principle that it's
[56:18] important to teach
[56:20] we that we need to learn ourselves that
[56:21] we teach our children this is what
[56:23] raising children in the path that they
[56:25] should go it's not in the way that you
[56:26] want them to be something so you're
[56:27] going to force them to be something but
[56:28] you teach them the right way to live
[56:31] to respect the word of god to respect
[56:32] other people
[56:33] and that's something that when they're
[56:34] older you say well i raised my son to be
[56:37] a lawyer and he's not a lawyer so i
[56:39] raised him in the path that he should go
[56:40] and he he's not he's departed from it
[56:42] wrong idea
[56:44] it's not what you think he should be
[56:46] it's what god wants him to be and you
[56:47] realize is the way that he has to live
[56:50] in order to become what god wants them
[56:51] to be so it's this principle of teaching
[56:53] us how to treat one another and how to
[56:55] make decisions and how to set standards
[56:58] and so that was kind of originally my
[56:59] whole thought is that
[57:01] if we could recognize these principles
[57:03] it was just something to look at to
[57:04] recognize god is the god of order god
[57:06] the god of the god of boundaries satan
[57:08] tries to use barriers to disrupt and
[57:10] make chaos in god's parameters
[57:13] but the second point which became more
[57:15] clear to me last week
[57:17] and a very pronounced way and i knew it
[57:19] was just the lord
[57:20] so not only was he
[57:22] wanting to equip us and point out a
[57:24] principle in the word of god that we
[57:26] could use in our daily lives but it was
[57:27] to give context to what has been
[57:30] and this may not be so for all of us but
[57:32] i believe it is for some of us that this
[57:34] subject has been enlightening in a
[57:37] retrospective way
[57:39] that if we were never able to actually
[57:41] articulate things we knew that there was
[57:43] an offense so we knew something was
[57:44] wrong we knew something didn't work out
[57:46] and there's many things in our past that
[57:47] we don't fully understand but using this
[57:50] principle we can look back and like well
[57:52] that could be that could be clearly
[57:54] defined as a boundary issue
[57:56] that's because i didn't set boundaries
[57:58] or that's because i went beyond this
[58:00] boundary and you start looking back and
[58:01] we recognize that many offenses and
[58:03] hurts and harms were bound related to
[58:05] where we did something we crossed a line
[58:08] or somebody else crossed a line and we
[58:09] start looking at all these different
[58:10] things and so we're looking back and it
[58:12] gives context to what has been
[58:15] and and looking back at what has been we
[58:17] take personal responsibility where we
[58:18] did not set limits we purpose to do so
[58:21] now we take personal responsibility
[58:22] where we transgress to other people's
[58:24] limits and we purpose in our hearts to
[58:26] do so to no longer do so
[58:29] and so in one sense it was to teach a
[58:31] principle in the word of god but in
[58:33] another sense it was to give perspective
[58:35] and to give context to things that have
[58:37] happened before so there's a part of us
[58:39] that maybe starts looking back and we
[58:41] start looking at things
[58:42] but what i want to say now is let's go
[58:44] forward
[58:46] let's not all of a sudden become
[58:47] spectators of our past and you remember
[58:49] this and you remember that you remember
[58:50] this you remember that we start trying
[58:52] to fix everything and define everything
[58:54] and try to create some sort of label or
[58:55] some sort of paradigm of what has been
[58:58] we don't want to be backward looking
[59:00] we want to go forward
[59:02] and i want to say this in going forward
[59:04] we did not share these things of
[59:05] barriers and boundaries to create a new
[59:07] paradigm or a worldview
[59:10] i know there's authors who have written
[59:12] on boundaries i know that there's a book
[59:14] that even i mentioned on when the body
[59:16] says no and one thing that i found
[59:18] sometimes with authors and these uh
[59:21] these views of certain things whether it
[59:23] be the body and sickness or whether it
[59:25] be uh social issues or whether it be
[59:27] personal relationships a particular
[59:29] writer or doctor or scholar will have a
[59:31] view a paradigm
[59:33] so that they just have a particular
[59:35] language to describe everything
[59:37] and so now instead of looking at things
[59:39] through the word of god and art we view
[59:42] the world through the word
[59:44] i did not introduce these principles so
[59:46] that we have a new worldview
[59:48] well everything's a barrier or a
[59:49] boundary no everything is what it is
[59:51] described in the word of god we don't
[59:53] look at things like oh oh your body is
[59:55] saying no then you probably have we're
[59:57] not freudian all of a sudden
[59:59] because there's there's certain
[1:00:00] principles that some of you have if
[1:00:01] you've read the book you'll find that
[1:00:03] some of these doctors say well if you
[1:00:04] have a problem in your pancreas it's
[1:00:06] probably because you're abused by your
[1:00:07] dad when you're eight years old in two
[1:00:09] days it's the only time it happens if it
[1:00:11] happens on that day you're gonna have
[1:00:12] pancreatitis for the rest of your life
[1:00:13] and it it's just because they view
[1:00:15] everything right
[1:00:17] eat right for your type can i get a
[1:00:19] witness anybody read the book right
[1:00:20] everything is oh you must be o positive
[1:00:22] and everything's viewed through that
[1:00:24] paradigm
[1:00:26] birth order
[1:00:27] some people they view everything as
[1:00:29] birth order you're first born aren't you
[1:00:31] no actually i'm the third born
[1:00:33] you have two older sisters don't you um
[1:00:35] no actually i've got two older brothers
[1:00:37] they were born in june weren't they
[1:00:40] and it's like
[1:00:41] there's a million ways to figure out why
[1:00:43] the third child is actually first in the
[1:00:45] birth order right
[1:00:47] because everything has to fit that
[1:00:49] paradigm this is not a new paradigm for
[1:00:51] us as believers we already got one
[1:00:54] it's the word of god the message of the
[1:00:56] hour the word of god the bible that's
[1:00:58] the way that we viewed the world this
[1:00:59] was not shared so that we have this new
[1:01:01] paradigm it's just terminology and
[1:01:03] principles to emphasize a truth that's
[1:01:05] in god's word
[1:01:07] and so i say that that we cannot we the
[1:01:09] these things have been spoken to equip
[1:01:11] us spoken to give context to what has
[1:01:13] been so let's go forward because we
[1:01:15] can't get caught looking back on what
[1:01:17] has been but we can't start trying to
[1:01:19] view everything going forward through
[1:01:20] something that's limited we've got to
[1:01:21] use the word of god
[1:01:24] the bible says in luke chapter 9 verse
[1:01:26] 62 and jesus said unto him no man having
[1:01:28] put his hand to the plow and looking
[1:01:30] back is fit for the kingdom of god
[1:01:33] when when it says a man putting his hand
[1:01:35] to the plow it doesn't mean he's
[1:01:36] borrowed somebody else's plow it means
[1:01:37] this is what he is this is what he does
[1:01:39] he's a farmer he has a job to do no man
[1:01:41] putting his hand to the plow to fulfill
[1:01:43] his job to fulfill his task to fulfill
[1:01:45] his duty looks back
[1:01:47] you don't turn around
[1:01:49] in this image you look at the ground
[1:01:51] that is before you
[1:01:53] if you've deviated from the past the
[1:01:55] path and the past only looking back on
[1:01:58] it's going to cause you to deviate in
[1:01:59] the future you look on the ground that
[1:02:01] is before you if a man who has a job to
[1:02:03] do is constantly looking back says he's
[1:02:05] not fit for the kingdom of god we can
[1:02:07] use this to say that all of us are
[1:02:08] citizens of the kingdom of god we have a
[1:02:11] job to do we're putting our hands to the
[1:02:13] plow as it were to do god's will and to
[1:02:15] perform his service and to and to lift
[1:02:18] up his kingdom if we're not looking
[1:02:20] forward we are not fit to declare his
[1:02:22] kingdom if we're not looking forward
[1:02:23] we're not reflecting or manifesting the
[1:02:25] attributes of his kingdom
[1:02:28] it says you're not fit for the kingdom
[1:02:29] it doesn't mean you're not worthy you
[1:02:30] can never have it you're going to be
[1:02:31] cast out it means you're not doing truly
[1:02:34] the lord's work you've got to have a
[1:02:36] face that is set you have to be looking
[1:02:38] forward you have to have your eyes on
[1:02:39] the goal and then with that in mind not
[1:02:42] always looking back on what has been but
[1:02:43] haven't kind of paused yes this has been
[1:02:45] horrible yes this has been harmful yes
[1:02:47] this has happened but i'm looking
[1:02:49] forward to the promise then you can
[1:02:51] properly convey the joy the happiness
[1:02:53] the forgiveness the reconciliation the
[1:02:56] healing the liberty that is in the word
[1:02:58] of god
[1:03:02] brother branham says and god is his own
[1:03:03] interpreter i know this is used quite
[1:03:05] often a very precise way he says living
[1:03:07] in a glare he said a glare is an image
[1:03:09] it's a mirage
[1:03:13] the sun reflecting itself and it's false
[1:03:15] and any glare of another age is a false
[1:03:17] reflection right
[1:03:19] he says this the people always are
[1:03:21] walking in something that happened years
[1:03:23] ago
[1:03:25] and we just we'd like to be oh those
[1:03:26] pentecostals yeah
[1:03:29] get him brother brandon rub that
[1:03:30] pentecostal kitty the wrong way
[1:03:32] you know what
[1:03:34] you're still whining and complaining
[1:03:35] about what happened to you five years
[1:03:36] ago
[1:03:38] i don't know being harsh i'm talking to
[1:03:39] a moses right now
[1:03:41] elijah will get under the juniper entry
[1:03:42] and talk a little bit but it's like some
[1:03:45] of us are living we're living walking is
[1:03:47] something that happened years ago
[1:03:50] that's our worldview it's our paradigm
[1:03:52] well this happened to me this happened
[1:03:54] to me this happened to me and he
[1:03:56] realized afterward well you're just a
[1:03:57] sum of everything that's happened to you
[1:04:00] so you're you you
[1:04:02] and brother branham is using this in a
[1:04:04] direct way but i believe the principle
[1:04:06] can even be used in this broad context
[1:04:07] people are always walking in something
[1:04:09] that happened years ago let's not do it
[1:04:12] in the sense that we're always recalling
[1:04:14] a former glory and all this was
[1:04:16] wonderful this was great but that's also
[1:04:17] not living the nastiness of our past
[1:04:20] the mistakes of our past the harms of
[1:04:22] our past at some point there has to be a
[1:04:25] confidence i am forgiven and i go
[1:04:27] forward there has to be a confidence
[1:04:29] that though i bear that with me let us
[1:04:32] go on into perfection
[1:04:34] though i might always be connected with
[1:04:37] my youth and i may always be connected
[1:04:39] with my past i still grow up into
[1:04:42] maturity and i still leave certain
[1:04:44] things behind and
[1:04:46] and and though i may never be severed by
[1:04:48] all the things that have made me who i
[1:04:50] am today and nature and nurture god has
[1:04:52] a way of placing those appropriate in my
[1:04:55] life that i can say all things have
[1:04:57] worked together for the good
[1:05:02] and and no way at all this is my this is
[1:05:04] my climax
[1:05:06] my summary and no way at all were these
[1:05:08] things shared to make us hesitant
[1:05:11] to make us reluctant we're we're always
[1:05:13] questioned i'm afraid to act because i
[1:05:14] don't want to offend somebody i'm afraid
[1:05:16] to move and do this but these things
[1:05:18] were shared to empower us
[1:05:21] to give us boldness
[1:05:23] to give us authority to go forward in
[1:05:25] god's path for us
[1:05:27] because all too often it's this uh this
[1:05:29] failure to really embrace the word of
[1:05:31] god it's this failure to have confidence
[1:05:34] in what god called you to do i looked
[1:05:36] back in my life and i realized that
[1:05:38] there was always this real subtle
[1:05:40] uh
[1:05:42] stab of the devil
[1:05:44] that and he would use people to do it to
[1:05:46] always try to cause me to question what
[1:05:47] my calling was
[1:05:49] that god had spoken to me in a very
[1:05:51] particular way
[1:05:52] in a very specific way
[1:05:54] and he had given me if i could say he
[1:05:56] had given me something to identify and
[1:05:58] it would be at this moment
[1:06:00] and had to do with pastoring this is
[1:06:03] this is this will be so when you begin
[1:06:04] to pastor and i didn't ever i knew it
[1:06:07] was the lord and i thought well there's
[1:06:08] just a number of ways that could happen
[1:06:09] so god interprets his word by bringing
[1:06:10] it to pass
[1:06:12] and there's always these kind of subtle
[1:06:14] digs through the ears
[1:06:16] that were trying to get me to waver on
[1:06:17] what my calling was well what do you
[1:06:18] think your gift is you know and always
[1:06:21] this and in my heart i knew well
[1:06:22] whatever whatever season i'm in however
[1:06:24] it's being used and whether i'm
[1:06:26] traveling and i'm going around the world
[1:06:27] or i'm doing this and doing that well
[1:06:29] you must be a teacher you must be a
[1:06:30] missionary you must be an evangelist
[1:06:31] you're this you're that in my heart i
[1:06:33] knew god had called me to be a pastor
[1:06:34] and i recognized there was always some
[1:06:36] kind of intimidation
[1:06:38] to try to make me reluctant about that
[1:06:41] and the moment the very moment when i
[1:06:43] when god
[1:06:44] it crystallized my wife is a witness to
[1:06:46] this
[1:06:47] that the very moment i knew that god had
[1:06:50] turned my heart
[1:06:51] and i was going to be that it was like
[1:06:53] god is calling me to phoenix
[1:06:55] to start a church and i'm going to be a
[1:06:56] pastor it'd been exactly a week since
[1:06:58] that threshold had been crossed
[1:07:00] that god had told me about before
[1:07:03] and it's not until it happens like oh my
[1:07:04] goodness look at all of this and i
[1:07:06] recognize years of where the devil is
[1:07:08] trying to bully and intimidate me from
[1:07:09] my calling
[1:07:11] and that's my testimony it's anecdotal
[1:07:13] but i hope to god that there's something
[1:07:14] you could recognize in your life there's
[1:07:16] always these things that just kind of
[1:07:17] try to push us of course and push us
[1:07:19] from doing the things that we know god
[1:07:20] has called us to do and try to
[1:07:21] intimidate us and so i share this to say
[1:07:23] that you have a call and you have
[1:07:25] borders you're to possess you have an
[1:07:27] inheritance let us be confident in what
[1:07:29] god has made us and let us be confident
[1:07:31] in what he's told us to do
[1:07:35] we can't be intimidated by man-made
[1:07:36] barriers
[1:07:38] masquerading as boundaries oh you can't
[1:07:41] do this you can't do that man-made
[1:07:43] barriers
[1:07:44] i studied the message and found that all
[1:07:45] the places that brother branham talked
[1:07:47] about denominational barriers being torn
[1:07:50] down he never tore down a word barrier
[1:07:53] it was always a man-made barrier
[1:07:55] i think i read every instance where
[1:07:57] brother bam talked about it because i
[1:07:58] wanted to be sure that i was being
[1:07:59] faithful to the message i want to be
[1:08:01] sure that what i had to share with
[1:08:03] there's this fidelity and harmony with
[1:08:05] what brother braun taught and i found
[1:08:07] everywhere brother man was talking about
[1:08:08] tearing down a boundary a fence a
[1:08:10] barrier a circle or whatever it was it
[1:08:12] was man that had put that there not god
[1:08:17] we're to respect others
[1:08:20] but that deference to others
[1:08:24] can never contradict god's will for us
[1:08:27] that means we can never fulfill god's
[1:08:29] word by being disrespectful
[1:08:31] but what god wants you to do may be
[1:08:33] different than what somebody else wants
[1:08:35] you to do
[1:08:40] where is it sometimes we find
[1:08:41] the greatest conflict in relationships
[1:08:44] is when you feel like you can't say no
[1:08:47] you got to do it to appease somebody and
[1:08:48] you got to do this and you got to do
[1:08:49] that because this is what happens and
[1:08:51] it's this real nasty dynamic
[1:08:53] and
[1:08:54] you realize that you're acting against
[1:08:56] conscience
[1:08:57] you're doing things you don't want to do
[1:08:59] all because of this person's
[1:09:00] sensitivities
[1:09:02] it's a real bad habit to get into
[1:09:05] because one day god says you've got to
[1:09:07] do this
[1:09:08] and then you're afraid to do it because
[1:09:09] you don't want to hurt somebody's
[1:09:10] feelings
[1:09:12] right
[1:09:15] i want to use an example
[1:09:18] in the spring of 1962 brother brown had
[1:09:20] a vision of shooting a large brown bear
[1:09:22] you familiar with this story
[1:09:25] and
[1:09:26] brother brown that during that time it
[1:09:29] was i believe it's april 1st is when he
[1:09:31] says he recently had a vision so may
[1:09:33] have been in march
[1:09:35] um that it happened but it was just
[1:09:36] sometime in the early
[1:09:37] spring 1962 and that time march april
[1:09:41] maybe even a little bit earlier be
[1:09:42] that's when he begins to tell this
[1:09:44] vision and he testifies that it's thus
[1:09:46] saith the lord
[1:09:48] and he gives these descriptions about it
[1:09:50] and the way that he described it and
[1:09:52] other stories he's starting to tell in
[1:09:53] the midst of this
[1:09:56] and i had i had the privilege years ago
[1:09:59] this was after i just began to serve the
[1:10:00] lord i think even before i was preaching
[1:10:02] years ago to hear
[1:10:04] it was through a personal in a personal
[1:10:06] way not over a pulpit or anything and
[1:10:07] preaching brother biscuit share with me
[1:10:09] some details to this and brother blaine
[1:10:12] is a witness witness brother billy paul
[1:10:14] brother bud southwick brother branham
[1:10:16] they were all hunting they went hunting
[1:10:17] again in canada that fall
[1:10:20] and these brothers can testify those
[1:10:22] that would be still living and and could
[1:10:24] share this and brother biscuit has done
[1:10:25] so publicly since
[1:10:28] and these are
[1:10:29] this is testimony of how that brother
[1:10:31] branham had this vision of a brown bear
[1:10:35] and brother biscuit and brother blaine
[1:10:36] and brother billy paul went out hunting
[1:10:38] and they witnessed that bear
[1:10:40] described it exactly and perfectly
[1:10:43] that bear that brother brown said he was
[1:10:44] going to shoot and i know this might
[1:10:45] seem to be a little bit
[1:10:47] this could for some it might sound
[1:10:48] teetering a little
[1:10:50] on an area that makes some people
[1:10:51] uncomfortable but you remember when
[1:10:53] brother branham told the story about
[1:10:54] being in south africa
[1:10:56] and god had told him to do one thing
[1:10:59] and he didn't do it
[1:11:00] god told him to do one thing and he
[1:11:02] didn't do it
[1:11:04] has any has god ever wanted you to do
[1:11:06] something
[1:11:07] and you didn't do it
[1:11:09] is there anybody here that's got a
[1:11:10] perfect record
[1:11:12] tell us the secret
[1:11:14] brother branham
[1:11:15] in south africa and there was a price
[1:11:17] that he paid was a tremendous
[1:11:18] consequence it's very instructive to us
[1:11:20] as believers to recognize that now this
[1:11:22] was a similar situation where he
[1:11:25] they see that they see this brown bear
[1:11:28] and they come back and i think the
[1:11:29] testament was oh brother brandon we saw
[1:11:30] this bear was exactly the one in the
[1:11:32] vision and things completely changed on
[1:11:33] the trip
[1:11:34] the rain came in it rained for days
[1:11:37] and brother branham comes back later
[1:11:39] after this hunting trip
[1:11:41] and he testifies
[1:11:44] in the message countdown
[1:11:47] he says this he says i find out
[1:11:49] if god has spoken anything
[1:11:52] that we must go with that word in order
[1:11:54] to make it be fulfilled
[1:11:56] now that's
[1:11:58] you hear that god speaks something if
[1:12:00] it's going to be fulfilled we have to go
[1:12:02] with it
[1:12:03] we've seen that as i told you last night
[1:12:04] a vision just recently
[1:12:06] i had to be there
[1:12:08] and wanting to be there
[1:12:10] in telling me six months before to be on
[1:12:13] that spot this fits perfectly with when
[1:12:16] he had the vision fits perfectly with
[1:12:18] the timeline than him going hunting in
[1:12:19] canada to be on that spot and stand
[1:12:22] there and say go down there three times
[1:12:24] with them
[1:12:27] and i walked on with the other men
[1:12:31] and the vision passed right through
[1:12:33] exactly god's part recognizing this
[1:12:37] god's part and i was left standing
[1:12:41] now i'm not this is this is just i want
[1:12:43] you just to use this as an example for
[1:12:45] our own lives
[1:12:46] so if there's more here that you need to
[1:12:48] drill down on what the points being made
[1:12:49] in brother branham's sermon and his life
[1:12:52] then god can certainly speak to you in
[1:12:54] this way but here's brother brown saying
[1:12:55] i had a vision i was warned i was told
[1:12:57] to do it i should have gone with them
[1:13:00] brother billy paul brother blaine but
[1:13:02] the biscuit i should have gone with them
[1:13:05] and i didn't i went with the other men
[1:13:08] god did his part exactly
[1:13:11] i was left standing
[1:13:13] so here's the instruction
[1:13:15] so we want to remember you've got to
[1:13:17] stay on the word just stay right with
[1:13:19] the word
[1:13:20] and where the word leads you go right
[1:13:22] with the word and it'll bring you out
[1:13:24] all right i'm sure
[1:13:26] what a lesson for us
[1:13:28] a prophet in his humility can admit to
[1:13:30] these things and tell us listen i've
[1:13:32] learned that if god has spoken anything
[1:13:34] we've got to go with the word in order
[1:13:36] for it to be fulfilled if god has spoken
[1:13:38] something for you don't be so
[1:13:40] presumptuous to think that he'll fulfill
[1:13:42] it if you don't go with what he says
[1:13:45] it doesn't matter how much thus say the
[1:13:46] oil god told me this is going to happen
[1:13:47] god told me this guy god told me this is
[1:13:49] going to happen if you don't stay with
[1:13:50] his word god can't do it for you
[1:13:53] this is a lesson to us very humbling
[1:13:55] lesson very striking lesson the humility
[1:13:57] of a prophet god did his part exactly
[1:14:00] the vision passed right through exactly
[1:14:03] god did his part there was this enormous
[1:14:06] brown bear but i was left standing
[1:14:10] and you think oh maybe that's the end of
[1:14:12] it that night he says and in his
[1:14:13] presence and father as i confess mine
[1:14:15] about misbehaving before them people
[1:14:18] earlier in this sermon i believe it's
[1:14:19] where he says there i was up on the
[1:14:21] mountain it was all snowy
[1:14:23] and he said god forgive
[1:14:25] uh
[1:14:27] i i think the word he uses um
[1:14:30] a stupid maybe i wish i would have
[1:14:31] brought the quote i cut it out
[1:14:33] maybe i do have it no
[1:14:36] he he uses a very harsh word for himself
[1:14:40] there that day on that mountain the
[1:14:41] storm blowing in he walked away and he
[1:14:43] asked for forgiveness and repented and
[1:14:45] then he says and father as i confess
[1:14:47] mine my sins my mistakes about
[1:14:49] misbehaving before them people i didn't
[1:14:51] carry on myself like a servant of christ
[1:14:54] i
[1:14:54] didn't you want to know why
[1:14:57] i was afraid that man might be angry
[1:14:59] with me
[1:15:00] and think i didn't want to hurt
[1:15:02] and think
[1:15:03] i didn't want to hurt his feelings but i
[1:15:05] didn't think of what i was doing to you
[1:15:08] lord do you recognize what happened
[1:15:12] he was told and warned to do something
[1:15:16] and the reason why he didn't
[1:15:18] is he had a friend
[1:15:20] that he was afraid he would hurt his
[1:15:22] feelings
[1:15:24] he's afraid he would disappoint him in
[1:15:25] his age
[1:15:27] and and maybe he's not able to go on
[1:15:28] that kind of a hunt to be that
[1:15:30] aggressive and to pursue something and
[1:15:32] maybe run up the mountain or whatever it
[1:15:33] is i'm just just trying to imagine what
[1:15:35] it might have been and he feels like oh
[1:15:37] i should go hunting with these young men
[1:15:39] and brother budd is going to be on his
[1:15:41] own or maybe he can do something else
[1:15:43] and instead of brother branham doing
[1:15:44] what he knew he should have done
[1:15:46] he had his feelings were being hurt for
[1:15:49] this older brother and he says i was
[1:15:51] afraid he'd get angry afraid of the
[1:15:53] response
[1:15:54] and as i afraid i'd hurt his feelings
[1:15:56] but i never thought about what i was
[1:15:58] going to be doing to you
[1:16:00] now think for a moment why why is this
[1:16:02] so important
[1:16:04] september 1962
[1:16:07] he's going to have another vision he has
[1:16:09] another vision where he's got to meet
[1:16:10] constellation of angels
[1:16:12] and he can't miss this one
[1:16:15] because if he misses that one none of us
[1:16:17] are here
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:19] god's teaching this prophet you've got
[1:16:21] to do your part well you've got this
[1:16:24] schedule you've got that schedule is
[1:16:26] this happening and that happened all
[1:16:26] these other barriers and barriers but
[1:16:28] you got to be there in arizona at that
[1:16:29] moment
[1:16:30] you got to be there at that time
[1:16:32] i didn't want to hurt his feelings but i
[1:16:34] think i didn't think of what i was doing
[1:16:35] to you lord and now i pray that you
[1:16:37] forgive me
[1:16:39] and now father i know that i ask
[1:16:40] forgiveness
[1:16:42] i have forgiveness
[1:16:44] and you put them in the sea of
[1:16:45] forgetfulness
[1:16:46] and you'll never remember that no more
[1:16:47] god i'm thankful for that
[1:16:58] there was a situation in the
[1:16:59] circumstance where prophet had to do
[1:17:01] something and go forward
[1:17:03] and there's still some to this day that
[1:17:05] are waiting for that brown bear to get
[1:17:07] shot and killed
[1:17:08] but brother branham tells us right here
[1:17:10] in the message of the hour
[1:17:12] it was there
[1:17:13] but i wasn't
[1:17:16] what do we learn from that there's a lot
[1:17:17] we can learn from that but for us
[1:17:20] if a prophet under a vision could feel
[1:17:22] the pressure to not do what god wants
[1:17:24] him to do in the face of opposition
[1:17:26] making somebody angry hurting somebody's
[1:17:29] feelings we ought to be able to
[1:17:31] appreciate the fact that this can be
[1:17:32] very hard on us in our lives
[1:17:34] but we must go forward
[1:17:37] we must do the things that we know that
[1:17:38] god has asked us to do
[1:17:40] and in acts chapter 28
[1:17:42] i want to use this in closing and i have
[1:17:44] a quote to
[1:17:45] refer to in this that brother branham
[1:17:48] refers to this
[1:17:49] in a message
[1:17:52] jairus jeru different ways you could
[1:17:54] pronounce it
[1:17:57] gyrus and divine healing but it says
[1:17:59] this is the story
[1:18:01] i'll just skip to verse
[1:18:04] verse three and there's so there's
[1:18:06] barbarious people barbarians there that
[1:18:07] are present as paul says and when paul
[1:18:09] had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid
[1:18:12] them on the fire there came a viper out
[1:18:14] of the heat and fastened on his hand
[1:18:17] anybody ever bit bit by a snake
[1:18:20] anybody raise your hand if you've been
[1:18:21] bit by snake
[1:18:22] why am i the only one
[1:18:25] does that disqualify me for anything he
[1:18:27] said have i not admitted that i got bit
[1:18:28] by a snake once
[1:18:30] it was this hand
[1:18:32] and it wasn't venomous but i know what
[1:18:34] it means to be snake bit
[1:18:36] because it was just a black snake it was
[1:18:38] just a chicken snake and i could feel
[1:18:39] the venom
[1:18:41] making its way to my heart
[1:18:44] and my dad said you shall take up deadly
[1:18:46] serpents and they shall not harm you and
[1:18:48] i said dad if it was going by faith
[1:18:49] right now i'd die
[1:18:51] because i'd been bit by a snake
[1:18:53] but this venomous snake attaches itself
[1:18:55] to his hand and fastens to his hand and
[1:18:58] the barbarians saw the venomous beast
[1:19:00] hang on his hand and they said among
[1:19:01] themselves no doubt this man is a
[1:19:03] murderer
[1:19:04] whom they though he escaped the sea
[1:19:06] vengeance he's getting his karma he's
[1:19:08] going to die a murderous man and
[1:19:11] suffered not to live and the gods
[1:19:14] have balanced the ledger though he
[1:19:16] survived the shipwreck you're going to
[1:19:18] get what's coming to you and they're all
[1:19:19] looking i'm like yep he's a murderer
[1:19:22] and it says in verse 5 and he shook off
[1:19:24] the beast into the fire and felt no harm
[1:19:30] and now they're looking
[1:19:31] kind of looking because he would have
[1:19:32] swollen and fallen dead suddenly so
[1:19:34] they're kind of like looking but after
[1:19:36] they had looked a great while and saw no
[1:19:38] harm come to him they changed their
[1:19:40] minds
[1:19:42] and said that he was a god
[1:19:45] i if you could make application to your
[1:19:47] life
[1:19:48] there's things that happen to us
[1:19:51] and when they happen some people may
[1:19:53] think we're just getting what's coming
[1:19:54] to us
[1:19:56] and then they just they expect that
[1:19:58] it'll ruin us
[1:20:00] they expect that it'll stop us satan
[1:20:03] even expects that it might weaken our
[1:20:04] faith our resolve there's this
[1:20:06] expectation all you got to do is invite
[1:20:08] them this venomous snake all you do is
[1:20:10] throw something in the way some harm
[1:20:12] some injury come
[1:20:13] and just wait give it time this will be
[1:20:16] their end but as paul was able to shake
[1:20:19] it off in the fire and as they all
[1:20:21] watched and he didn't swell up and he
[1:20:23] didn't die then they changed their minds
[1:20:27] it was in the fact that paul continued
[1:20:30] it was the fact that paul might have
[1:20:32] just went about his business uh
[1:20:33] gathering sticks and tending to the fire
[1:20:36] and it says that paul shook off the
[1:20:38] beast under the fire and felt no harm
[1:20:41] now we have that kind of saying in our
[1:20:43] own lives when you shake something off
[1:20:44] we say shake it off or just shake off
[1:20:47] something walk off something it means to
[1:20:49] deal with something or recover from an
[1:20:51] injury or to recover from a negative
[1:20:53] feeling just shake it off just walk it
[1:20:55] off to successfully recover to
[1:20:58] successfully deal with something either
[1:21:00] whether it be a physical injury or even
[1:21:02] a negative feeling and so i impressed
[1:21:04] this to you i felt so supremely led if i
[1:21:07] just read one scripture and told one
[1:21:09] story it would be this that whatever has
[1:21:11] happened to you whatever has bitten you
[1:21:13] whatever has uh uh have occurred then
[1:21:16] whatever has taken place i say shake it
[1:21:19] off and go forward
[1:21:22] though it may be a fearful sight and
[1:21:24] thought may seem to be painful no matter
[1:21:26] what it's a venomous snake people that
[1:21:28] has happened this too they've died i say
[1:21:31] right now just as paul knew that he was
[1:21:33] going to rome you know that you've got a
[1:21:36] purpose you know you have a job you know
[1:21:38] you have to call it whatever has
[1:21:40] happened to you in the past i say shake
[1:21:42] it off and go forward
[1:21:45] and let this be something this guiding
[1:21:47] principle as we go forward as believers
[1:21:49] whatever comes up if you get bit by a
[1:21:52] snake something happens some offense
[1:21:54] comes some harm comes something takes
[1:21:56] place i just say it successfully deal
[1:21:59] with it
[1:22:00] and recover and go forward and whatever
[1:22:04] the enemy wants to say about the snake
[1:22:06] bite he'll have to change his mind when
[1:22:09] you don't succumb to its venom
[1:22:13] they'll have to well i thought for sure
[1:22:15] this message would crumble with the
[1:22:16] website
[1:22:18] i thought for sure all i had to do was
[1:22:19] bring that up and the thing would fall
[1:22:21] to its knees i thought for sure just to
[1:22:23] cause them to be debilitated physically
[1:22:25] i thought for sure throw this in their
[1:22:27] way throw that in their way but they
[1:22:29] just keep shaking it off
[1:22:31] over and over and over why we've got a
[1:22:34] revelation we've got a vision we've got
[1:22:37] thus saith the lord and we can't miss it
[1:22:42] i'm not suggesting you won't feel it
[1:22:44] i've been bitten by a snake i'm the only
[1:22:45] one here can testify
[1:22:48] i've been bit by a snake you'll feel it
[1:22:51] you want to hear the whole story
[1:22:55] i won't save it for the evening service
[1:22:56] i'll tell you now
[1:22:59] my dad was preaching in the back woods
[1:23:00] of missouri
[1:23:02] but jared is that brother brown's
[1:23:05] it's probably where we met met and hung
[1:23:06] out back in the 80s
[1:23:08] and
[1:23:09] we're on our way home and my brother
[1:23:10] david loves to collect all sorts of
[1:23:12] critters
[1:23:13] matter of fact first time you ever met
[1:23:14] my wife he says you want to see my pet
[1:23:15] lizard she's very naive she said yeah he
[1:23:18] went to the freezer and pulled out a
[1:23:19] dead bearded dragon that had been there
[1:23:21] for
[1:23:22] years and introduced
[1:23:23] her to the corpse of a dead bearded
[1:23:25] dragon
[1:23:27] so that's david that's kind of the way
[1:23:28] that he is
[1:23:30] and so we're driving home we're picking
[1:23:31] up all sorts of turtles and everything
[1:23:33] else for david when we get home and
[1:23:35] there's this gigantic five foot long
[1:23:37] black snake in the middle of the road
[1:23:39] my dad says we should
[1:23:40] we should uh we should catch it
[1:23:43] all right dad you go for it
[1:23:46] and we're in the process of trying to
[1:23:47] catch it it goes into the grass and i
[1:23:49] try to reach for it it bites me and
[1:23:51] i panic and go to the car and
[1:23:53] finally my dad steps on its head and i
[1:23:55] grab it i grab it and we put it in a box
[1:23:59] and well we grab it and we're walking
[1:24:01] across the street holding a five foot
[1:24:02] long snake and another
[1:24:05] family probably just got out of the upc
[1:24:06] church down the road
[1:24:08] and we're walking by with a snake
[1:24:09] they're probably like bless god real
[1:24:11] believers
[1:24:12] real believe they must be they're gonna
[1:24:13] have an evening service tonight right
[1:24:16] let's follow them to church
[1:24:18] and they see us walk in with this snake
[1:24:20] and we put it in this box and we're
[1:24:21] driving and i've got teeth marks just
[1:24:23] all in my hand and my heart's pounding
[1:24:25] and i'm dying
[1:24:27] and and any moment my heart is going to
[1:24:29] seize up and my dad
[1:24:31] uses this
[1:24:33] uh scripture to try to encourage me it's
[1:24:34] not working and i'm holding this box i'm
[1:24:36] like dad we got to get somewhere to tape
[1:24:37] this thing up there's a convenience
[1:24:39] store up ahead and right about that
[1:24:40] moment the snake pops its head up out of
[1:24:42] the box
[1:24:43] and i'm face to face
[1:24:46] with the beast
[1:24:48] the devil himself
[1:24:50] who beguiled eve
[1:24:52] and now it's the it's the my mount zion
[1:24:54] showdown
[1:24:56] and i shriek
[1:24:58] and just push the box away from me
[1:25:01] and out comes the snake towards my dad
[1:25:04] so now my dad's driving his pickup truck
[1:25:06] and he wants to get away from the snake
[1:25:08] so he steers away from it
[1:25:12] i don't know if he finished high school
[1:25:15] he stares this way and it just causes
[1:25:17] the snake to
[1:25:18] pile up almost in his lap so he wants to
[1:25:21] get it away from him he learned
[1:25:24] steered the other way so now it's coming
[1:25:25] towards me and he's trying to do this
[1:25:26] dirt hurt and finally and this
[1:25:28] pentecostal family's still behind us
[1:25:30] so you can just imagine they know age
[1:25:32] pulls off the side room we both just
[1:25:33] bolt out each door
[1:25:35] i'm like dad let the snake go
[1:25:38] and we let the snake go
[1:25:40] and i lived
[1:25:41] i wasn't resurrected from the dead no
[1:25:43] hands were laid on me the pentecostals
[1:25:45] didn't pull over and said you guys are a
[1:25:46] bunch of make believers let us lay hands
[1:25:48] on you
[1:25:49] they just drove on and didn't follow us
[1:25:51] to the evening
[1:25:52] service but that's like that's my snake
[1:25:55] bit story
[1:25:56] and haven't been snake but i'd say i'm
[1:25:58] not saying you won't feel it i'm not
[1:26:00] suggesting it at all
[1:26:01] i'm not suggesting that what has
[1:26:03] happened to you before is trivial i'm
[1:26:04] not suggesting that there should have
[1:26:06] been any pain i'm not suggesting that
[1:26:07] going forward there's not going to be
[1:26:09] any pain
[1:26:11] but it shall not hinder
[1:26:13] it said that he shook it off in the fire
[1:26:15] and felt no harm
[1:26:17] that means whatever it could have done
[1:26:19] it didn't do
[1:26:21] he felt no harm
[1:26:23] and i know sometimes in our lives we're
[1:26:25] told it's time to move on but that whole
[1:26:27] phrase too can be very disrespectful and
[1:26:29] have a lot of meaning that it doesn't
[1:26:30] mean so let me say this it's not time to
[1:26:32] move on let's go forward and we may
[1:26:34] carry with us the sufferings of our past
[1:26:36] i have even dear dear dear friend who
[1:26:39] suffered a tremendous loss and it's
[1:26:41] interrupted his whole life
[1:26:43] and some some people may tell him you
[1:26:44] just need to move on you just need to
[1:26:45] move on but you know what this brother
[1:26:47] can't he can't move on
[1:26:49] but what he needs to do is go forward
[1:26:51] carry the loss carry the grief carry
[1:26:53] whatever it is god will use it but don't
[1:26:56] let it don't let it stop you
[1:26:59] we got a job to do let's go forward
[1:27:01] and brother graham said why it never
[1:27:03] scared paul he looked at it like that so
[1:27:05] full of the holy ghost his whole inner
[1:27:07] body just charged with the power of god
[1:27:08] this wasn't my response he looked at it
[1:27:10] and shook it off in the fire and said
[1:27:12] i've got to go before caesar what are
[1:27:15] you bothering me about like that and
[1:27:17] went on walking it didn't bother him
[1:27:19] didn't scare him a bit
[1:27:22] why he knew god had called him to do
[1:27:24] something
[1:27:25] oh god give me the courage that when i
[1:27:28] know you want me to do something i can
[1:27:30] face the opposition and say i i don't
[1:27:33] know what it'll mean to you but i've got
[1:27:35] to do what god wants me to do
[1:27:38] it didn't matter to him
[1:27:40] and i close on this we'll invite the
[1:27:42] musicians to come
[1:27:44] we'll close on this just prior to this
[1:27:47] uh actually
[1:27:49] just before brother makes this statement
[1:27:51] brother ram comes to this very story of
[1:27:53] paul shaking off this serpent in the
[1:27:55] fire
[1:27:56] this is this is his this is what he's
[1:27:58] tracking are you still with me it's 1209
[1:28:01] if you've been disciplined not to look
[1:28:02] to this point god bless you i know it's
[1:28:05] running long
[1:28:06] but i'm finishing
[1:28:07] a 13-part series i mean you need time
[1:28:09] you need time to do this
[1:28:12] but listen
[1:28:13] and paragraph 35 he says we ought to get
[1:28:15] ourselves in that kind of atmosphere
[1:28:17] create each one of you as a creator did
[1:28:19] you know that
[1:28:20] each one of you people that's born again
[1:28:22] is a creator we must create an
[1:28:23] atmosphere as i said the other night
[1:28:26] and then he tells the story the next
[1:28:27] paragraph it's long when this is just um
[1:28:29] the digital version
[1:28:31] he said the evils and he said he tells
[1:28:32] the story of how chaos is in the home
[1:28:34] and his wife is all upset and he just
[1:28:35] changes the atmosphere
[1:28:38] helps wash dishes and different things
[1:28:39] and the children start playing with
[1:28:40] blocks and he says it's the atmosphere
[1:28:46] you got you got the get to get away from
[1:28:48] it
[1:28:50] from that old confusion
[1:28:52] there's this old confusion this old
[1:28:54] malaise this old way of thinking you got
[1:28:56] to get away from something you even got
[1:28:57] to get away from this bad atmosphere
[1:28:59] that's been created you got to get away
[1:29:01] from it from that old confusion and now
[1:29:02] i love this oh am i going to be he says
[1:29:05] you're scared
[1:29:07] that's what's the matter
[1:29:08] and he says you'll this is a principle
[1:29:11] this is
[1:29:11] and and you say well why you keep
[1:29:12] pushing it because there's something
[1:29:13] here i've got to get to this i got to

[1:29:19] you're filled with the holy spirit says
[1:29:22] now i'm going to shock you a little bit
[1:29:25] and i think i've already used way too
[1:29:27] much of my own testimony to even have
[1:29:29] the right to say this so i'll i'll have
[1:29:31] to take a few months off with testifying
[1:29:34] i heard this as a young boy and i put it
[1:29:36] into practice and it's never failed me
[1:29:39] i heard it just took i was like i
[1:29:41] believe it i believe it i'm gonna use it

[1:29:48] for instance a meats of frying and all
[1:29:50] at once the grease pops out on your hand
[1:29:52] now if you'll just shake it off and go
[1:29:55] on frying meat
[1:29:56] it wouldn't bother you
[1:29:59] now you didn't get that just right look
[1:30:02] first thing oh wear the uncontent
[1:30:06] that's a even today i think it's still

[1:30:42] when your mind first goes to the harm
[1:30:44] the damage the pain what it could mean
[1:30:46] he says it's immediately then that your
[1:30:48] body's even going to give in and it's
[1:30:50] going to blister i i know i'm amplifying
[1:30:52] it

[1:30:59] you what is it that happens to us
[1:31:01] sometimes things just happen and we make
[1:31:02] it such a big deal
[1:31:04] instead of just shaking it off and going
[1:31:06] forward
[1:31:08] he says why'd you fear that's the matter

[1:32:23] is no past me that's breathing there is
[1:32:25] no me that exists somewhere else in the
